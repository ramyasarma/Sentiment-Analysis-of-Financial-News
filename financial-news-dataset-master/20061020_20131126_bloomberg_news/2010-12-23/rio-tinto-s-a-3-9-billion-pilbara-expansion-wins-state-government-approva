Rio Tinto Group’s plan to expand its
Pilbara iron ore operations in Western Australia have been
approved by the state’s government. The A$3.9 billion expansion
will boost Rio Tinto’s Pilbara iron ore capacity by more than 50
percent, to potentially more than 300 million tons a year,
Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett said in an e-mailed
statement today. Barnett has approved early works for the
project, which is centered on the expansion of the Cape Lambert
port facilities to include an additional 1.8 kilometer jetty and
four-berth wharf, which will support a two-stage increase in
capacity, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
