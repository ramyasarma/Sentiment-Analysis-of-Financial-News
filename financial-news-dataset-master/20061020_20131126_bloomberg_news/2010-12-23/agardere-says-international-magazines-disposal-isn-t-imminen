Lagardere SCA  said talks on the sale
of its international magazines business have “no calendar nor
exclusivity,” and no transaction is imminent.  Reports suggesting that France’s largest publisher, which
is considering a sale of foreign titles including the U.S.
edition of Elle, is near a deal “come from anonymous sources
who don’t seem to know the reality of the situation,”  Ramzi Khiroun ,  a spokesman at Paris-based Lagardere, said in an e-
mail. Les Echos reported today that  Lagardere  may announce an
agreement to sell the magazines to Hearst Corp. within days.  Chief Executive Officer  Arnaud Lagardere  is looking to
focus on Lagardere’s book-publishing and domestic magazine
businesses while also pushing into sports marketing. Lagardere
has begun work on an initial public offering of its 20 percent
stake in pay-TV operator Canal Plus France, and is targeting a
sale of its 7.5 percent stake in  European Aeronautic Defence &
Space Co. , the parent of planemaker Airbus SAS.  Lagardere said on Dec. 1 that it aims to retain editorial
control of Elle, which has more than 40 international editions,
as part of any transaction. The company’s magazines unit, whose
titles include Paris Match and Car and Driver, accounted for
about 22 percent of sales last year, or 1.7 billion euros ($2.2
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
