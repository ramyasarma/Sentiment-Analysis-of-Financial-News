Maersk Oil , a unit of A.P. Moeller-
Maersk A/S, agreed to buy SK do Brasil Ltda. for $2.4 billion,
giving the Danish company access to three offshore oil blocks.  The Nordic region’s second-largest producer will acquire a
40 percent stake in the Polvo field, a 20 percent stake in the
Wahoo discovery and a 27 percent stake in the Itaipu discovery,
Copenhagen-based Maersk said in a statement to the stock
exchange today. Polvo and Itaipu are operated by Devon Energy
Corp., while Wahoo is operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  “This investment will contribute significantly to
replacing Maersk Oil’s reserves in the long term as we expand in
one of the world’s most attractive regions for the exploration
and production industry,”  Nils Smedegaard Andersen , A.P.
Moeller-Maersk’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.  After receiving regulatory approval, Maersk will replace
Devon as the operator of Polvo and Itaipu, the company said.  Maersk has been looking to Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico,
Qatar, Angola and Greenland to revive production growth.  In March, Maersk agreed to buy a 20 percent stake in the
 BM-C-34 license off the coast of Brazil  from Devon Energy Corp.,
which had also  agreed  to sell a stake in the permit to BP Plc.  SK do Brasil’s share of production at Polvo is 10,000
barrels of oil per day, Maersk said. The Wahoo and Itaipu
discoveries will be appraised next year and production may start
by 2016 and 2018, respectively.  SK do Brasil is a unit of SK Energy Co., Ltd., South
Korea’s largest oil processor.
