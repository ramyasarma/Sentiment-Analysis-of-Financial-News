U.S. stocks fell after a five-day
rally sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the most expensive
level since June, offsetting a rebound in orders for durable
goods and a drop in unemployment claims.  Lennar Corp.  and D.R. Horton Inc. dropped at least 2.9
percent after a government report showed that fewer new homes
than forecast were sold in November.  Bank of America Corp. 
slumped 2.9 percent after a judge gave  MBIA Inc.  permission to
use statistical sampling, rather than going through every loan,
in a fraud lawsuit.  Micron Technology Inc.  lost 3.3 percent as
the largest U.S. maker of computer-memory chips reported fiscal
first-quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates.  The  S&P 500  retreated 0.3 percent to 1,255.27 at 2:57 p.m.
in New York. Its rally to a two-year high yesterday pushed its
valuation to 15.7 times reported profits, the highest since
June. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 2.38 points, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 11,557.11. U.S. stock exchanges are closed
tomorrow for the Christmas holiday.  “The stock market has come up too far, too fast,” said
 James Paulsen , chief investment strategist at Minneapolis-based
Wells Capital Management, which oversees $342 billion. “Many
people are wondering how far it will go before a pullback. The
economic data points that we’re getting are good on balance, but
not madly positive. That could explain the muted response of
investors.”  46% Plunge  The  S&P 500  completed its recovery this week from the 46
percent plunge that followed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
bankruptcy in September 2008 as government data showed that the
world’s largest economy grew at a faster pace in the third
quarter than previously estimated. The stock index rallied 6.6
percent in December through yesterday after posting a combined
gain of 13 percent in September and October, the biggest
increase during those months since 1998.  U.S. equity futures pared declines after Labor Department
figures showed  jobless claims  fell last week and the number of
people on unemployment benefit rolls dropped to a two-year low,
reinforcing evidence the labor market is improving. First-time
filings for jobless insurance declined by 3,000 to 420,000 in
the week ended Dec. 18, matching the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Separately, the Commerce Department said that bookings for
goods like computers and communications gear climbed 2.6 percent
after a 3.6 percent decline in October that was smaller than
previously estimated. Another Commerce Department report showed
that spending by U.S. consumers increased in November for a
fifth month, showing the biggest part of the economy is
strengthening heading into 2011.  Home Sales  Stocks extended declines amid concern about weakness in the
U.S. housing market. Builders sold fewer new homes than
estimated in November as purchases increased 5.5 percent to a
290,000 annual rate from a 275,000 pace in October that was
lower than previously estimated, figures from the Commerce
Department showed. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a 300,000 pace.  All 12 stocks in the S&P 500 Supercomposite Homebuilding
Index declined, sending the group down 2.8 percent.  Lennar , the
third-largest U.S. homebuilder, slumped 4.1 percent $18.18. D.R.
Horton, the second-largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue, slid 2.9
percent to $11.92.  Financial stocks had the biggest decline among 10
industries in the S&P 500, falling 0.8 percent.  Lawsuit  Bank of America dropped 2.7 percent to $13.02, the biggest
decline in the Dow. The lender lost a bid to prevent MBIA from
using statistical sampling to pursue repurchase demands in a
lawsuit claiming it was fraudulently induced to insure $21
billion in mortgage-backed securities.  MBIA  asked New York State
Supreme Court Judge  Eileen Bransten  to allow company lawyers to
develop evidence using samples from 368,000 mortgages in 15
securitized pools to establish its fraud claims, rather than go
through each loan.  “The court does not find any prejudice in deciding the
motion before it and allowing the use of statistically
significant samples of the securitizations at issue,” Bransten
ruled yesterday.  MBIA rose 0.1 percent to $9.91.  Micron  fell 3.1 percent to $8.02. Fiscal first-quarter
sales of $2.25 billion missed the average analyst  projection  of
$2.37 billion.  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.  slid 1.1 percent to $23.90 after BMO
Capital Markets cut the exchange operator’s stock rating to
“market perform” from “outperform.”  Optimism  “Optimism on stocks got very high yet people are afraid to
short the market,” said  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage $21
billion at Irvington, New York-based Security Global Investors.
“The economy is growing at a moderate pace, but most data
points are moving on the right direction. The U.S. will likely
surprise positively.”  U.S. stock bullishness among newsletter writers has risen
to the highest level since the middle of October 2007, the week
after the S&P 500 and the Dow climbed to records. The proportion
of bullish publications tracked by Investors Intelligence jumped
to 58.8 percent on Dec. 21 from 56.8 percent a week earlier, the
firm said yesterday. Sentiment has improved since October 2008,
when the financial crisis drove the figure to a 20-year low of
22.2 percent.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.  had the biggest gain in the S&P 500,
rising 5.4 percent to $50.25. The home furnishings retailer
forecast full-year earnings of at least $2.86 a share, beating
the  average analyst estimate  by 5 cents. The company also
announced a $2 billion buyback plan.  Alcoa Inc.  rose the most in the Dow, climbing 1.2 percent
to $15.33. The largest U.S. aluminum producer may be bought for
$22 a share next year, TheStreet.com’s  Jim Cramer  said.  “We won’t comment on speculation,” said Mike Belwood, an
Alcoa spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
