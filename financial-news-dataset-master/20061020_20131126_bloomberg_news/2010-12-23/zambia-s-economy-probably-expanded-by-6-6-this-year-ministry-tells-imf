Zambia’s economy probably expanded
by 6.6 percent this year and the country is on track to achieve
an 8 percent inflation target by year end, the country’s finance
ministry said in a letter to the International Monetary Fund
published on the website of the IMF yesterday.   Revenue for the year will likely be 9 percent over target
while expenditure will be 7 percent higher than expected after
the government bought a corn surplus from farmers, the ministry
said in the letter.   The country will aim to reduce inflation to 7 percent by
the end of 2011 and broad money growth may slow to 15 percent,
it said.   Zambia will try and export the 800,000-ton corn surplus it
acquired and will re-examine the way the national corn industry
is run, the ministry said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
