Daimler AG , the world’s largest
truckmaker, will begin producing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans at
a factory owned by billionaire  Oleg Deripaska ’s OAO  GAZ ,
expanding its commercial-vehicle presence in Russia.  Daimler will invest more than 100 million euros ($131
million) in manufacturing the delivery van at GAZ’s plant in
Nizhny Novgorod, the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said today
in a statement. Output may total about 25,000 units a year, it
said.  “The Russian market for commercial vehicles is offering
major growth prospects,” Daimler Chief Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  said in the statement.  Daimler , which also makes Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, is
expanding in emerging markets to take advantage of growing
demand for commercial vehicles. Daimler expects the Russian
market to expand to 275,000 light commercial vehicles a year by
2020 from 177,000 now, according to the documents distributed
today to reporters at GAZ’s plant.  Daimler also owns an 11 percent stake in Russian truck
producer KamAZ. The two companies, which already operate
ventures to assemble Fuso Canter and Mercedes Actros vehicles in
Russia, last week signed a preliminary agreement to jointly
produce truck axles.  The German manufacturer, which makes Mercedes trucks in
Europe, Fuso models in Asia and Freightliner vehicles in the
U.S., said Sept. 21 that eight-month truck sales in Brazil,
Russia, India and China rose 64 percent. The unit’s total sales
through the first nine months rose 27 percent to 17.2 billion
euros ($22.5 billion).  Revenue at Daimler’s van unit increased 28 percent to 5.6
billion euros in the first nine months after sales surged 44
percent to 160,000 vehicles.  GAZ  is the leader in the Russian
market for light trucks and buses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
