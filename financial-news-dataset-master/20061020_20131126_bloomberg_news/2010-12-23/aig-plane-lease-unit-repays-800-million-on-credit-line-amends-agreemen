American International Group Inc.’s
plane-leasing unit repaid $800 million to lenders under a deal
that amends a credit agreement so that impairments aren’t
counted against the subsidiary in determining covenants.  International Lease Finance Corp.’s net loss for the nine
months ended Sept. 30 was primarily due to impairment and lease-
related charges as the unit sells aircraft, the Los Angeles-
based subsidiary said today in a statement on its $2.5 billion
credit facility with lenders including Citigroup Inc. and Bank
of America Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
