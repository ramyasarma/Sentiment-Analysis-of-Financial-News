Hynix Semiconductor Inc. will start
mass production of smaller 30 nanometer chips in the first
quarter, Park Seong Ae, a spokeswoman at the company, said
today, confirming an Edaily report. A nanometer, one billionth
of a meter, measures the size of transistors within a chip
where lower numbers indicate more advanced technology that
enables smaller, more efficient chips to be made.  To contact the reporter on this story:
