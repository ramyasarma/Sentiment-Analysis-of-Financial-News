HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest
bank, named  Alan Keir  as global head of commercial banking in a
further management reshuffle following the appointment of  Stuart Gulliver  as chief executive officer.  Keir, currently global co-head of commercial banking and
head of commercial banking in Europe, will take up the new
position on Jan. 1, the London-based company said today in a
statement.  “Alan has a tremendous understanding of business gained
from 19 years’ experience in commercial banking,”  Sandy Flockhart , chairman of Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin
America and commercial banking, said in the statement.  Gulliver won a succession struggle at the bank in
September, replacing  Michael Geoghegan . HSBC this month named
 Samir Assaf  as head of its investment bank and appointed  Paul Thurston  in November to run consumer banking and wealth
management.  The move brings single-person accountability to the
commercial-banking division, which provided about one-third of
HSBC’s pretax profit in the first half, the company said.  John Coverdale , the other global co-head of commercial banking, will
become head of global transaction services on March 1, reporting
to Keir and Assaf, HSBC said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
