Soybean futures rose to a 28-month
high as demand rebounded in China, the world’s largest consumer.
Corn rose, capping a fifth straight weekly gain as hot, dry
weather threatened crops in Argentina. Wheat was little changed.  U.S.  exporters  sold 827,810 metric tons of soybeans in the
week ended Dec. 16, more than nine times the total a week
earlier, the Department of Agriculture said today. China
purchased 77 percent of last week’s total shipments from the
U.S.  Sales  for delivery in the marketing year that began Sept. 1
are 12 percent higher than a year earlier.  “Export sales improved last week because China returned to
the U.S. markets,” said Mark Schultz, the chief analyst for
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “Chinese
demand will continue to provide support into 2011.”  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 20.25 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $13.60 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the highest close since Aug. 1, 2008.
Prices gained 3.8 percent for the week and 51 percent since the
end of June as China’s demand surged and hot, dry weather
reduced U.S. yields.  China’s December soybean imports may be 5.3 million tons,
Grain.gov.cn said in e-mailed daily report today. Shipments for
January and February are forecast at 5 million tons and 3.5
million tons, respectively, said the unit of the China National
Grain & Oils Information Center.  Farm-commodity prices will extend rallies next year, driven
by increased demand from emerging markets and higher oil costs,
Rabobank Groep NV said in a note on Dec. 21.  South American Crops  Corn and soybeans also rose on concern that hot, dry
weather will damage crops in Brazil and Argentina, the biggest
exporters after the U.S.  Argentine soybean farmers, the world’s third-largest
producers, have planted 74.7 percent of the crop, down from 85.7
percent a year earlier, because of a lack of rain, the Buenos
Aires Cereals Exchange said today in a report. Planted acreage
may fall to 18.5 million hectares (45.7 million acres) in the
current season, from 19 million a year earlier, the exchange
said.  Soybeans yields in Brazil’s southern Rio Grande do Sul
state may be cut by 20 percent as the La Nina weather pattern
produces hot, dry weather next year, forecaster Somar
Meteorologia said Dec. 20.  “Corn and soybean markets are adding in weather premium,”
said Bill Gentry, a broker at  Risk Management Commodities Inc .
in Lafayette, Indiana. “If Argentina misses the next rain, it
will be like throwing gasoline on a fire,” given the rising
demand in China, Gentry said.  Grain Prices  Corn futures for March delivery rose 5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $6.14 a bushel in Chicago, capping the first six-day
gain since Sept. 17. Earlier, prices touched $6.1475, the
highest since Nov. 9. Futures advanced 2.9 percent this week and
64 percent since the end of June on speculation that demand for
grain-based animal feed and fuel will reduce U.S. inventories.  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.5 cent to close at
$7.83 a bushel on CBOT, after rallying as much as 0.6 percent to
$7.8825, the highest since Dec. 10. The most-active contract
gained 3.5 percent this week.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show. The U.S. is the world’s largest grower and exporter of
both crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
