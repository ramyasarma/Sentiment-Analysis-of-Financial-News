SouFun Holdings Ltd.,  a Beijing-
based operator of home-furnishings websites, agreed to buy a
Lower Manhattan building once owned by  American International
Group Inc.  for $46 million.  SouFun plans to purchase 72 Wall St., which once served as
AIG’s training center, according to a statement issued yesterday
by the company. The deal on the 250,000-square-foot building may
be completed in the first half of 2011, SouFun said.  “SouFun plans to use the former AIG Training Center as its
own global training center to train its expanding management,
staff and clients,” according to the company statement.  AIG, the global insurance company bailed out by the U.S.
government in 2008, sold the building in 2009. The buyers were
Kumho Investment Bank, a South Korean firm, and Youngwoo &
Associates, a Manhattan-based developer. It was part of a two-
building deal that included AIG’s headquarters at 70 Pine St.  To contact the reporter on this story:
