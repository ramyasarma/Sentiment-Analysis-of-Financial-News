The pound rose for the first time in
five days after a Bank of England official said in a newspaper
interview that he expects interest rates to rise.  The British currency rebounded from near a three-month low
after BOE Markets Director  Paul Fisher  told the Daily Telegraph
the U.K.’s borrowing costs will “head back to a normalized
position” of 5 percent. The yen gained for a fourth day versus
the dollar, its longest streak since Oct. 8, on signs China is
taking more measures to cool growth. New Zealand’s currency
surged as Finance Minister Bill English said the nation’s
economic expansion will accelerate next year.  “Rate hikes from the BOE seem possible,” said  Norifumi Yoshida , vice president of the trading section in Singapore at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., a unit of Japan’s second-largest
banking group. “This is causing buying of the pound.”  The pound advanced to $1.5424 at 6:42 a.m. in London from
$1.5386 in New York yesterday, when it fell to $1.5356, the
lowest level since Sept. 14. The euro increased to $1.3133 from
$1.3100, after touching $1.3074 on Dec. 21, the weakest since
Dec. 2. The yen rose to 109.16 per euro from 109.47, after
advancing earlier today to 108.92, the strongest since Dec. 1.  The yen climbed to 83.12 per dollar from 83.57 yesterday
and reached 83.07, the strongest since Dec. 14. New Zealand’s
dollar rose to NZ$1.3439 per Australian dollar from NZ$1.3489
yesterday, when it reached as low as NZ$1.3521, the weakest
since September 2000.  BOE Policy  The BOE won’t “be putting up rates so quickly” as to
cause “negative reaction” and will only tighten policy quickly
if the strength of the economy demands it, Fisher said,
according to the newspaper. Bank of England policy makers were
split three ways for a third month on the need for economic
stimulus as some officials became more concerned that inflation
may persist.  Adam Posen kept up his demand to increase the 200 billion-
pound ($308 billion) bond-purchase plan by 50 billion pounds,
according to minutes of the nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee’s Dec. 9 decision released yesterday in London. Andrew
Sentance voted to raise the interest rate for a seventh month
and the rest ensured no change in policy. The pound was at 85.17
pence per euro from 85.14 yesterday.  Japan’s currency strengthened against 15 of its 16 major
counterparts after China’s benchmark money-market rates surged
to the highest level since October 2007.  ‘Monetary Tightening’  “The surge in money-market rates may reflect monetary
tightening in China,” said  Lee Wai Tuck , a currency strategist
at Forecast Pte in Singapore. “This seems to be sparking risk
aversion. The bias is for the yen to be bought.”  Gains in the euro were tempered on concern European banks
and nations will need to raise more funds. Europe’s currency is
heading for a weekly loss against 14 of its 16 major
counterparts as the European Central Bank will lend banks 149.5
billion euros for three months to meet their liquidity needs
over the year-end period.  “When you start to stare in the face of funding
requirements out of the euro nations, the ones that are in
trouble in particular, that can’t help an already poor
situation,” said  Alex Sinton , a senior currency dealer at ANZ
National Bank Ltd. in Auckland. “The bias has got to be on the
downside for the euro and the upside for the dollar.”  The ECB said yesterday 270 banks asked for the unlimited
funds over 98 days, which will be loaned at its average
benchmark interest rate over the period. Banks today need to
repay 96.9 billion euros in maturing 12-month loans and 38.2
billion euros in three-month loans tomorrow.  Poland Funding  Poland is seeking to replace its $21 billion credit line at
the  International Monetary Fund  with a two-year, $29 billion
one, John Lipsky, the IMF’s No. 2 official, said yesterday.  New Zealand’s currency rebounded from an early decline
after a government report showed the economy shrank 0.2 percent
in the three months to Sept. 30, compared with a median estimate
for 0.1 percent growth.  “I’ve said all along this recovery would be a bit bumpy at
times and that’s proved to be the case,” Finance Minister
English said in an e-mailed statement. “The recovery remains on
track. I am quite confident the economy will build momentum in
2011 and beyond.”  Taiwan’s dollar gained as economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News said  industrial production  rose 12.5 percent in November
from a year earlier.  The currency was also supported after jobs data, announced
toward the end of trading yesterday, which showed the
 unemployment rate  fell to a two-year low of 4.79 percent in
November. This was below the median estimate of 4.9 percent in a
Bloomberg survey.  “The economy is doing well and that supports the Taiwan
dollar,” said  Tarsicio Tong , a Taipei-based currency trader at
Union Bank of Taiwan. “Volumes are thin these days,” he said.  The Taiwanese currency appreciated 2.6 percent to NT$29.825
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
reached NT$29.766 on Dec. 17, the strongest since October 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
