Snow in northern France will force
the cancellation of 20 percent of today’s flights at Charles De
Gaulle airport north of Paris, Aeroports de Paris said on its
website. At secondary hub Orly, south of the French capital, the
same proportion of flights will be cancelled before 1 p.m.  Meteo France, the state meteorological agency, has placed
regions including the Ile-de-France around Paris on ‘Orange
Alert’ due to snow, the second-highest level on its four-tier
scale of weather severity.  Air France will allow passengers to delay planned journeys
until March 5, the airline said in a statement published in Les
Echos today. The airline urged passengers to check flight delays
before travelling to their departure airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
