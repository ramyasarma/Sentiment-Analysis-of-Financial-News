Sony Corp. , Japan’s largest
electronics exporter, will buy back a semiconductor plant from
Toshiba Corp. for about 50 billion yen ($598 million) to double
production capacity of image sensors, the Nikkei newspaper said.  Sony, which sold the plant in Nagasaki prefecture to
Toshiba in 2008, will buy the facility and double its monthly
production capacity of the sensors, used in digital cameras and
smartphones, to about 40,000 units from about 20,000 units,
Nikkei  reported , without saying where it obtained the
information.  Sony, in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today,
said it hadn’t made any announcement regarding the purchase.  Toshiba, Japan’s largest chipmaker, had previously paid 90
billion yen to Sony to buy the production facilities for making
video-game chips.  To contact the reporter on this story:
