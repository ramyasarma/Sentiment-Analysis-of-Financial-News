Verigy Ltd.  surged as much as 8.9
percent after the maker of testing equipment for semiconductor
manufacturers said it received a sweetened takeover offer from
 Advantest Corp.  for $15 a share, valued at about $900 million.  Advantest’s cash bid is 23 percent more than a Dec. 6 offer
of $12.15, Singapore-based  Verigy  said today in a statement.
Verigy climbed 90 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $13.53 at 1:13 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading , after rising as
high as $13.75. The shares had dropped 1.8 percent this year
before today.  The new proposal raises the stakes in a bidding war between
Advantest and  LTX-Credence Corp.  for Verigy, a maker of testing
gear for chips including those that handle so-called flash
memory, which store songs and photos in products such as Apple
Inc.’s iPhone. The acquisition would help Tokyo-based  Advantest ,
which has lost money in each of the past two fiscal years,
reduce its reliance on the computer memory equipment, where
manufacturers have cut back on investment in machinery.  Verigy announced in November it would merge with  LTX-
Credence,  based in Milpitas, California. Verigy said today that
its  board  continues to recommend the LTX-Credence transaction to
shareholders. The board isn’t making any recommendation about
the revised proposal by Advantest and anticipates more
discussions with that company, Verigy said.  Verigy had 60.5 million outstanding shares as of Dec. 8,
according to  Bloomberg data . On that basis, Advantest’s new bid
would value the company at $907.8 million.  LTX-Credence shares fell 17 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $7.60
on the Nasdaq. Advantest dropped 0.2 percent to 1,886 yen in
Tokyo trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
