Copper, trading little changed, may
rebound as global supplies are expected to lag behind demand.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.2 percent to $9,365 a metric ton,
and traded at $9,360 by 9:05 a.m. Singapore time. It fell for
the first time in four days yesterday.  Copper for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
rose as much as 0.6 percent to 69,120 yuan a ton, while futures
on the Comex in New York climbed as much as 0.2 percent to
$4.2850 a pound.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
