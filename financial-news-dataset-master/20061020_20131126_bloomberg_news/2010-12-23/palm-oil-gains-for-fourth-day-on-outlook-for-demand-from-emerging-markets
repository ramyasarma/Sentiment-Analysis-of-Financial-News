Palm oil advanced for a fourth day
on speculation that China, the top cooking oils user, and other
emerging markets will fuel demand for farm commodities in 2011.  The March-delivery contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange gained 1.1 percent to settle at 3,658 ringgit ($1,175)
a metric ton in Kuala Lumpur. The price reached 3,766 ringgit on
Dec. 14, a 33-month high.  Farm-commodity prices will extend rallies next year, driven
by increased demand from emerging markets and higher oil costs,
Rabobank Groep NV said in a note on Dec. 21. Palm oil has risen
37 percent this year, set for a second annual gain, on concern
that rising demand from China and India, the biggest users, may
strain global cooking oil supplies curbed by rain and drought.  Palm-oil prices will “remain high” in 2011 on increasing
Chinese demand for oilseeds and higher biofuels output, Rabobank
said. Surging energy costs, low global food stocks and a weak
dollar may also bolster prices of agricultural commodities, the
report said. Palm and soybean oils are direct substitutes.  China’s December soybean imports may be 5.3 million tons,
Grain.gov.cn said in e-mailed daily report today. Shipments for
January and February are forecast at 5 million tons and 3.5
million tons, respectively, it said. Grain.gov.cn is a unit of
the China National Grain & Oils Information Center.  “China accounts for 60 percent of global soybean imports,
in addition to approximately 20 percent of world-traded soybean
oil,” Rabobank said. “Such tremendous growth is likely to be
replicated in other commodities as China’s shifting consumption
patterns increase demand.”  Soybean Plantings  Soybean futures for March-delivery advanced to the highest
level in more than two years, gaining as much as 0.7 percent to
$13.495 a bushel in Chicago. Soybeans have surged 31 percent
this year on concern that dry weather in South America may
threaten crops in Brazil and Argentina amid rising global
demand, led by China.  “Soybeans at record peaks have definitely been the
trendsetter today” for palm oil prices, Anand James, chief
analyst at Geojit Comtrade Ltd., said by e-mail. “Underlying
fundamentals have been quite bullish in edible oils market due
to inclement weather in Argentina and prospects of firm demand
in China.”  Argentina’s soybean crop may shrink 21 percent next year as
dry weather delays planting and hurts growing conditions, Oil
World said on Dec. 21. Production in five South American growers
may drop by 8 million to 10 million tons, the researcher said.  Palm oil may climb to 4,000 ringgit in the first quarter as
traders in China rebuild inventories before the Lunar New Year,
when demand for food soars, said  Arhnue Tan , a senior analyst at
ECM Libra Capital Sdn. The celebration falls in early February.  ‘Bull Trend’  The drop to 3,500 ringgit has “rejuvenated” the market,
and prices may move up 3,770 ringgit to 3,790 ringgit before
pulling back next month, said James. “A close above 3,800
ringgit would be a signal toward continuation in the bull
trend.”  March-delivery soybean oil on the Chicago Board of Trade
gained as much as 1 percent to 57.14 cents a pound.  Palm oil for September on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
climbed 2.2 percent to close at 9,648 yuan ($1,452) a ton.
Soybean oil rose 2.8 percent to 10,448 yuan a ton at the close.  CME Group Inc.’s March palm-oil contract gained 0.3 percent
to $1,176.50 a ton at 2:38 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
