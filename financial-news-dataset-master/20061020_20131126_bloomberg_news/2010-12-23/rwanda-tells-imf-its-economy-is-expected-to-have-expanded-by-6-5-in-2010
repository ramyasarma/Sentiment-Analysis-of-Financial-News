Rwanda’s economy probably expanded
by 6.5 percent this year, the country’s finance minister and
central bank governor said in a letter to the International
Monetary Fund that was published on the lender’s website today.  Annual inflation is likely to be below 5 percent by the end
of the year, lower than a 7 percent target, while the current
account deficit will be 7 percent, rising to 9.5 percent in
2011, Finance Minister John Rwangombwa and Governor of the
National Bank of Rwanda, Francois Kanimba, said in the letter.  While credit growth to private companies was about 11
percent, less than the 20 percent expected, it may rise to 22.4
percent next year, the two officials said. Broad money growth
was 13 percent this year and will rise to 13.8 percent in 2011.  Rwanda has agreed to limit borrowing for its national
airline and a conference center in the capital to $240 million,
the officials said. Separately two state-owned banks are seeking
$55 million in loans, they said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
