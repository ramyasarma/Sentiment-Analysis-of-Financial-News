The rand strengthened to an almost
three-year high on speculation investors are buying the currency
to benefit from its yield advantage as the U.S., Japan and
Europe keep interest rates low to boost their economies.  South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 0.7 percent
to 6.7478 per dollar, its strongest intraday level since January
2008. The rand traded 0.5 percent stronger at 6.7646 as of 4:15
p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 6.7975.  “On a trade-weighted basis, the rand is on the front foot
and as long as quantitative-easing measures in the U.S. and
Europe continue, the search for yield will persist and the rand
will keep grinding stronger,” Trevor Barsdorf, an analyst at
 Econometrix Treasury Management , a Johannesburg-based bond and
foreign-exchange advisory, said in a telephone interview.  The rand has surged 39 percent since the start of last year
as developed nations cut rates to near zero to pull their
economies out of recession, while South Africa’s  central bank
rate  is still 5.5 percent even after nine reductions since
December 2008. Portuguese 10-year bond yields rose by almost
half a percentage point in the past two weeks as investors bet
the country may follow Ireland in seeking financial help, adding
to the depth and breadth of the European Union’s debt crisis.  The rand may advance as much a 2 percent versus the dollar
by year-end should it close stronger than the “key technical
level” of 6.77 per dollar today, said Barsdorf. A close
stronger than 6.77 would propel the rand to 6.71, from which it
may gain to 6.64, said Barsdorf.  Key Level  “If the rand cracks through 6.77 then you’re looking at
6.71, and if it cracks through there you’re talking 6.64,” said
Barsdorf. “The key level is 6.77 -- it’s coincides with the
prior lows” for the dollar versus the rand since the start of
November.  Apart from today’s move the rand has twice breached 6.77
per dollar in the past two months, climbing to 6.7683 on Nov. 4
and to 6.7603 on Nov. 5. On both occasions the rand failed to
close stronger than 6.77, making it a key technical resistance
level for the currency, said Barsdorf.  Government bonds were little changed, with South Africa’s
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 steady at
123.81 rand. The yield on the bond was little changed from
yesterday’s close at 7.42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
