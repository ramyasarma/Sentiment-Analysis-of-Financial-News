General Electric Co . said it will do
a second phase of dredging New York’s upper Hudson River to
comply with a plan by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
to lower the amount of toxic sediment in the waterway.  The dredging will begin before mid-2011, and an after-tax
charge of $500 million will be taken in the current quarter to
pay for the project, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company
said today in a statement.  GE said it expects the charge to be offset by a favorable
tax settlement and that this phase of cleanup will resolve
future Hudson dredging liabilities. The EPA has had technical
discussions with GE to plan the dredging methods.  The cleanup aims to remove 95 percent of PCBs, or
polychlorinated biphenyls, from a 40-mile stretch of the river
near Albany. Even then, it will be decades before all advisories
on eating fish from the river can be lifted, the EPA has said.
PCBs are industrial compounds that resists chemical and
biological breakdown, and scientists consider it a likely human
carcinogen.  The EPA in 2002 released a plan to dredge pollutants,
including PCBs, that GE’s factories in Hudson Falls and Fort
Edward dumped for three decades starting in the 1940s. In August
2009, GE’s dredging was temporarily suspended when tests showed
PCB levels were exceeding EPA standards.  GE  has spent  more than $830 million on the cleanup and
research since 1990 and says about 2 million cubic yards of
sediment will be removed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
