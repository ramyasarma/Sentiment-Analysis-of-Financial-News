Q-Cells SE   rose  in Frankfurt and
headed for its largest three-day increase since June after
investors decided this year’s worst-performing solar equipment
maker had declined too much.  The shares climbed as high as 2.67 euros, bringing the gain
since Dec. 20 to 26 percent. Even with the rally, the German
solar-cell manufacturer is still down 72 percent this year and
ranks last on the 38-member  Bloomberg Global Leaders Solar
Index , which has dropped 21 percent.  “The stock had possibly fallen below its fair value
because there’s no news to explain” the surge,  Alla Gorelova ,
an analyst at Steubing AG in Frankfurt, said in an interview.
“It’s probably a technical recovery.”  The company, which is trading at 26 times estimated 2010
earnings, is trying to lower production costs and compete with
cheaper Chinese-made products to return to profit after a 1.36
billion-euro ($1.78 billion) loss in 2009.  The shares are continuing a rebound that began after they
hit 1.97 euros, their lowest in at least five years, on Nov. 30.  The gain pulled up the company’s 6 3/4 percent convertible
notes due in 2015, whose 6.7 percent leap was it’s largest since
the bonds were sold in October. Their three-day increase has
pushed down the yield to 12.75 percent from a record high of
15.6 percent, according to generic prices on Bloomberg.  Gorelova said Q-Cells also may be considered a takeover
target by investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
