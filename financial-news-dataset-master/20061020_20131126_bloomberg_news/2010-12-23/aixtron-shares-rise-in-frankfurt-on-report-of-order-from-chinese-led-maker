Aixtron AG , which makes equipment
used to produce light-emitting diode screens, rose in Frankfurt
trading on a report that a Chinese LED maker placed an order
with the German company.  Aixtron  shares  rose as much as 1.89 euros, or 7.6 percent,
to 26.84 euros and traded at 26.83 euros as of 10:51 a.m. local
time.  China’s LED industry in 2011 is expected to install 700 to
800 units of metal organic chemical vapor deposition equipment,
or MOCVD machines, more than double this year’s pace,
 Digitimes.com  reported, without saying where it obtained the
information. The machines are used to produce semiconductor
layer structures for use in light-emitting diodes and other
products.  One LED maker has ordered 400 to 500 MOCVD machines from
Aixtron, Digitimes said, citing unidentified people.  Guido Pickert , spokesman for the Herzogenrath, Germany-
based company, declined to comment on the report, saying that
it’s not entirely clear how China plans to realize its five-year
plan on LED technology, including investment in MOCVD machines.  “If these numbers come true, it will be fine for both us
and  Veeco , the other main supplier to this market,” Pickert
said, referring to the order numbers cited in the report. Veeco
Instruments Inc. is based in Plainview, New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
