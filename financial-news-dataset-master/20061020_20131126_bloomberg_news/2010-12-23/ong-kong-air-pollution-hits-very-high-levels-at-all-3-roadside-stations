Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at all three of the city’s roadside monitoring
stations today, the Environmental Protection Department said on
its website.  The index was 127 in Mong Kok, 126 in Central and 103 in
Causeway Bay as of 6 a.m., the department said.  Roadside pollution above 100 triggers a government warning
for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
