President  Barack Obama  will delay
the release of his budget for the 2012 fiscal year by about one
week, until after Feb. 14, an administration official said.  The administration will need more time to prepare the
budget because of delays in Senate confirmation of budget
director  Jack Lew  and congressional approval of government
spending measures this year, the official said.  The administration’s budget proposal is typically released
the first Monday in February, which would be Feb. 7 in 2011.  Lew, who was nominated by Obama for the top budget post in
July, wasn’t confirmed by the Senate until Nov. 19 because of a
dispute with Senator  Mary Landrieu , a Louisiana Democrat, over
off-shore oil-drilling policies.  Congress adjourned yesterday without completing work on
legislation that would fund the government through the 2011
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Earlier this week, Congress
approved a measure to pay for government operations through
March 4 after Republicans blocked a $1.2 trillion spending bill
that would have funded the government until the end of the
fiscal year.  The action by lawmakers means federal agencies will go
roughly halfway through their 2011 fiscal year without updated
budgets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
