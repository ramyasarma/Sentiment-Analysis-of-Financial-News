The U.S. Transportation Department
today proposed new limits on hours of service for commercial
truck drivers to reduce the risks of fatigue.  The proposal would keep a “34-hour restart” provision
allowing drivers to restart the clock on their weekly 60 or 70
hours by taking at least 34 consecutive hours off-duty.  Under the proposed new rules, the restart period would have
to include two consecutive off-duty periods from midnight to 6
a.m., and drivers would be allowed to use the restart only once
during a seven-day period.   The proposal will be published in the Federal Register on
Dec. 29, and the public will have 60 days to comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
