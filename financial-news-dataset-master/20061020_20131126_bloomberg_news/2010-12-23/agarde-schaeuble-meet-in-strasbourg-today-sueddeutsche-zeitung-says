French Finance Minister Christine
Lagarde and her German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble, plan to
meet in Strasbourg today to discuss how the two countries can
develop joint economic forecasts on growth, inflation,
investments and the labor market, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported
in an interview with Lagarde.  Lagarde said France wouldn’t be willing to introduce euro
bonds at the current juncture as this would require common
economic governance in the euro region, according to the
newspaper.  France is “unconditionally committed” to reducing its
debts in tandem with Germany, Sueddeutsche cited the French
finance minister as saying.  Asked whether France would be prepared to relinquish
control of its fiscal policy to the European Union, Lagarde said
it’s “impossible” to take budgetary sovereignty from national
states, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
