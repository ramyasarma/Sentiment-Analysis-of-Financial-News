U.S. stocks rallying amid the
narrowest swings in three years have pushed the  VIX  down to a
level that makes  options  attractive as a cheap hedge against
losses, according to Macro Risk Advisors LLC.  While there are economic risks that might otherwise drive
up the cost of buying options as insurance, the VIX is being
dragged down by one of the lowest  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
volatility levels in four years, said Macro Risk President  Dean Curnutt . That means stock investors should buy options because
their prices are poised to rebound next year on renewed concern
about European government debt, according to Curnutt, who
predicted the region’s credit crisis.  “Systemic risk is still very much active in the market,”
Curnutt said in an interview. “The sovereign risk issue is
almost guaranteed to flare up again in 2011.”  Demand for options to protect stocks is waning after the
S&P 500 rose above its level on Sept. 12, 2008, before Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy prompted a 46 percent plunge
in the stock index through March 2009. The VIX, as the  Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index  is known, fell to a
three-year low yesterday as the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks
moved in its narrowest intraday range since April 2007. The VIX
dropped 6.3 percent to 15.45 yesterday as the S&P 500 traded in
a 0.35 percentage-point range, less than half the past month’s
average.  Stimulus, Rally  The VIX rose 6.6 percent to 16.47 as of 4:15 p.m. in New
York. March  VIX futures  rose 1.1 percent to 23.20. The index has
tumbled by almost two-thirds from this year’s peak of 45.79 in
May, and is below this year’s average of 22.65. The volatility
gauge has averaged 20.40 over its two-decade history.  U.S. government and Federal Reserve spending to stimulate
the economy and 70 percent of S&P 500 companies beating profit
estimates for a record six straight quarters pushed the S&P 500
up 86 percent to 1,256.97 since March 9, 2009. The index will
end 2011 at 1,374, according to the average projection of 11
strategists at Wall Street’s biggest banks, producing the
biggest three-year rally since 1997-1999.  Portuguese 10-year bond yields rose by almost half a
percentage point in the past two weeks as investors bet the
country may follow Ireland in seeking aid after European Union
officials deferred a decision on whether to let the European
Financial Stabilization Mechanism buy bonds of the most indebted
countries.  Portugal Downgraded  Fitch Ratings said today that it downgraded Portugal’s
long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings to
A+ from AA- and short-term foreign currency rating to F1 from
F1+. Greece may have its credit rating cut to non-investment
grade within six weeks after a review of the nation’s “fiscal
sustainability,” the agency said Dec. 21.  “A VIX of 16 doesn’t even come close to reflecting just
how serious the European sovereign debt crisis is,” Curnutt
said. “To put this in context, when the VIX closed below 16 on
April 14, the average credit-default swap level across Portugal,
Ireland, Greece and Spain was 220 basis points. That same spread
now is nearly three times that.”  The average cost of swaps to protect debt from those four
nations from a default rose a fifth day today to 602 basis
points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and New York-
based Macro Risk Advisors. The level first exceeded 500 basis
points on Nov. 3.  Greece swaps increased to 1,054 basis points today, the
highest level of the four nations, while Ireland’s rose to 600.
Portugal’s were unchanged at 495 while Spain’s dipped to 364.  “We see a material increase in U.S. equity volatility
sometime in the first half of 2011, as it becomes clearer that
this debt crisis has not been sufficiently addressed,” Curnutt
said. “We want to be the other side of investors who believe
the financing struggles in Europe will be contained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
