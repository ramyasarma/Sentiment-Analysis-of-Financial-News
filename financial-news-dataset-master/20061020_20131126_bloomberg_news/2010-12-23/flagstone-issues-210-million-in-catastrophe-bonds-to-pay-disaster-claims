Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings SA , a
Luxembourg-based company founded in response to the 2005
hurricane season, added to its protection from natural disasters
by issuing $210 million of catastrophe bonds.  One portion provides $70 million of coverage and pays 11.9
percentage points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate,  Brenton Slade , a spokesman for company, said today
in an interview. Another, at $80 million, yields 16.4 percentage
points above the benchmark. A third, $60 million slice pays 9.5
percentage points above Libor.  All three mature in 2014 and cover losses from U.S.
hurricanes and earthquakes, according to Slade. The $80 million
piece also protects against Cayman Islands hurricanes.  “These transactions continue to reinforce our capital
strength,” Flagstone Chief Executive Officer  David Brown  said
in a statement announcing the issue.  The reinsurer climbed 15 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $12.62
at 2:02 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It
has risen 15 percent this year.  Flagstone was formed after reinsurance losses from
hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, according to its  website .
The company previously issued $175 million in catastrophe bonds
through a special purpose reinsurer called Montana Re, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
