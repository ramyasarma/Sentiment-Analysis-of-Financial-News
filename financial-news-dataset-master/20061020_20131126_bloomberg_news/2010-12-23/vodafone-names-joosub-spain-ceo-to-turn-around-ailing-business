Vodafone Group Plc  replaced the
chief executive officer of its Spanish unit as the world’s
largest mobile-phone company tries to turn around the business
in one of its worst-performing European markets.  Shameel Aziz Joosub , an executive director of Vodafone’s
Vodacom unit in South Africa, was named CEO after  Francisco Roman  was appointed executive chairman,  Simon Gordon , a company
spokesman, said today via phone. The new CEO will report to
Roman, he said.  First-half service revenue at the Spanish unit, excluding
currency swings and acquisitions, fell 7.1 percent while
declining 1.3 percent in Europe as a whole, Vodafone said in
November. European service revenue accounted for about two-
thirds of total sales last year.  Faced with unemployment at almost 20 percent in Spain and
the deepest government budget cuts in three decades, Vodafone’s
local unit has struggled to attract customers to higher-priced
smartphones. Spain, reeling from the collapse of a debt-fueled
housing boom, has the highest unemployment rate in the euro
region and the third-largest budget deficit.  Vodafone CEO  Vittorio Colao  said in May that Europe was one
of the company’s three “priority areas” alongside sub-Saharan
Africa and India. Colao, who has been in his position at
Newbury, England-based Vodafone for two years, said he was only
“somewhat satisfied” with the Spanish unit as it sought to
combat a sales drop and drive fixed-broadband use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
