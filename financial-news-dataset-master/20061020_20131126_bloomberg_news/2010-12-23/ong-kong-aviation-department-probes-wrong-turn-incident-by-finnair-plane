Hong Kong’s Civil Aviation
Department said it’s investigating an error by an aircraft
operated by Finnair Oyj at Hong Kong International Airport last
month.   The aircraft, bound for Helsinki, attempted to takeoff
after making a wrong turn onto a taxiway on Nov. 27, according
to a government statement. No one was hurt, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
