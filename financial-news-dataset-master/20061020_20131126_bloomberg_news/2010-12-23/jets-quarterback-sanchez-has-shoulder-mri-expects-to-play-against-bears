New York Jets quarterback  Mark Sanchez  said he expects to start on Dec. 26 against the Chicago
Bears after having an MRI on his throwing shoulder this week.  Sanchez said he injured his right shoulder in the first
quarter of the Jets’ 22-17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on
Dec. 19. He stayed in the game, throwing for 170 yards and
rushing for a touchdown. Sanchez said he felt pain throughout
the game.  “It was just a precautionary MRI and I’m very pleased with
the results,” Sanchez, 24, said yesterday in a press
conference. “I’ll be ready to go for Sunday. I felt good in
practice.”  Coach  Rex Ryan  said the test revealed a sore shoulder and
he is “99 percent sure” Sanchez will play against the Bears.  Sanchez has started 32 of the Jets’ 33 games since being
selected with the fifth pick in the 2009 draft. The former
University of Southern California quarterback has completed 54
percent of his passes this season for 3,022 yards and 16
touchdowns. He also has thrown 12 interceptions, all in the last
nine games.  Though limited at practice, Sanchez said that if the Bears’
game were yesterday he would have been able to play. The Jets
(10-4) can clinch a playoff spot with a win over the Bears (10-
4) or a victory against the Buffalo Bills (4-10) on Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
