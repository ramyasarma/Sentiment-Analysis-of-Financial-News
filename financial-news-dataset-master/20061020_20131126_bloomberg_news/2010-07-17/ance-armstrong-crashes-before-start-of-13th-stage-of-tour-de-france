             Lance Armstrong ’s final Tour de
France isn’t getting any better.  
 The seven-time champion, who dropped down the standings
after a puncture and several accidents in the last two weeks,
crashed before reaching the start line of today’s 13th stage,
according to the race website. The stage is a mainly flat 122-
mile ride between Rodez and Revel.  
 Armstrong fell on the 4-mile ride to the start before
getting back on his bike and rejoining the other 176 riders
still in the race,  letour.com  said, without giving more details.
He is 32nd in the standings, more than 21 minutes behind race
leader  Andy Schleck .  
 The 38-year-old Texan said last month this will be his last
Tour. On July 11, he said his chances of a final title ended
after he clipped a curb coming out of a roundabout and crashed
during the first Alps stage. It was one of three crashes on the
same day for Armstrong, who barely had a mishap in winning the
race seven times through 2005.  
 The Tour enters the Pyrenees tomorrow for the first of
four mountain stages in five days. Defending champion  Alberto Contador  trimmed Schleck’s lead to 31 seconds yesterday. The
race ends July 25 in Paris.
