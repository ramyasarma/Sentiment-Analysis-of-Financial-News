             Germany’s economy grew more than 1.5
percent in the second quarter,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing an
internal government estimate.  
 That exceeds the government’s latest forecast, which in
April anticipated an increase in the  gross domestic product  of
0.9 percent for the second quarter, the magazine said.
