             Innkeepers USA Trust, a hotel
company owned by  Apollo Investment Corp. , is preparing to file
for bankruptcy, according to two people with knowledge of the
plan.  
 The company, a real estate investment trust with stakes in
73 hotels in the U.S., may file as soon as today, said one of
the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private.  
 Steven Anreder , a spokesman for Apollo Investment, declined
to comment.  Dennis Craven , Innkeepers’ chief financial officer,
didn’t immediately reply to a voicemail and an e-mail sent
outside regular business hours.  
 Apollo Investment Corp, which is managed by an affiliate of
New York private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC,
bought the company for about $1.5 billion in June 2007, at the
peak of the buyout boom and just before property prices started
to tumble. Innkeepers USA, based in Palm Beach, Florida, said in
April that it didn’t make some monthly interest payments on its
debt and may miss future obligations.
