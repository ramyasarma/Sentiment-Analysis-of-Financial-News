             The Saudi Binladin Group issued a
700 million-riyal ($187 million) Islamic bond, known as sukuk,
on July 12 through a private placement to Saudi investors as the
Jeddah-based company expands its operations.  
 The Saudi Binladin Sukuk Co. issued the Islamic bond, which
was more than 2.5 times oversubscribed, lead manager  HSBC Saudi
Arabia  said in an e-mailed statement today. The sukuk had a zero
coupon on a discount-to-maturity basis, the unit of HSBC
Holdings Plc said in the statement.  
 Companies in Saudi Arabia, the largest Arab economy, are
stepping up bond sales as they fund expansion. Corporate debt
sales from the kingdom totaled $3.23 billion by May 2010, from
$200 million in the period a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi Electricity Co., the Arab world’s
largest utility, sold 7 billion riyals in Islamic bonds in May.  
 The Saudi Binladin Group will invest 105 million euros
($136 million) to more than quadruple output at a Senegalese oil
refinery, Qasim al-Shaikh, the oil and petrochemical unit chief,
said May 1. The group is also bidding to develop the first phase
of an airport at Medina, home to Islam’s second-holiest site.
