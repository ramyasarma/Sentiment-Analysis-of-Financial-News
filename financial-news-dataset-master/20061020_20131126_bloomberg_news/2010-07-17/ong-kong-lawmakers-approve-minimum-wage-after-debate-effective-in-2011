             Hong Kong lawmakers approved the
territory’s first minimum wage, which may increase costs for
employers including  Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd.  and
Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.  
 Legislators passed the government’s minimum wage bill after
a 41-hour debate, according to an e-mailed statement. Secretary
of Labor and Welfare  Matthew Cheung  said in the statement the
law is expected to take effect in the first half of next year.  
 The bill provides the framework for a legal minimum wage
that will be decided by Chief Executive  Donald Tsang  as early as
October, lending protection to Hong Kong’s 3.67 million-strong
labor force. Labor groups have proposed a floor of HK$33 ($4.23)
per hour.  
 Dairy Farm’s 7-Eleven convenience store chain pays some
Hong Kong workers as little as HK$20 an hour, the South China
Morning post reported on July 13, citing a survey by the Hong
Kong People’s Alliance for Minimum Wage.  
 Rosa Li, a spokesman for Dairy Farm, which owns and
operates nearly half the territory’s roughly 950 7-Eleven
outlets, declined to say how much it pays workers. Dairy Farm
employs 14,000 in Hong Kong, she said.  
 A Sun Hung Kai spokesman said it’s impossible to gauge the
impact of the law until the minimum wage level is set. The
company employs 31,000 workers.
