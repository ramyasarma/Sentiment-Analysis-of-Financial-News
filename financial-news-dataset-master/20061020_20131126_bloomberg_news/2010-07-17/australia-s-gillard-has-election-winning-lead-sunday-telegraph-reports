             Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  has an election-winning lead that relies on preferences
from green voters, the Sunday Telegraph said, citing a Galaxy
poll.  
 Gillard’s Labor party has a so-called two party preferred
support of 52 percent, compared with the opposition Liberal-
National coalition’s 48 percent, the newspaper reported.  
 Gillard’s primary vote has fallen to 39 percent from the 41
percent recorded in the days after she became prime minister on
June 24. Coalition leader  Tony Abbott  stands on 42 percent and
the Greens party has 13 percent. The survey covered 800 voters
on July 16, and no margin of error was stated.
