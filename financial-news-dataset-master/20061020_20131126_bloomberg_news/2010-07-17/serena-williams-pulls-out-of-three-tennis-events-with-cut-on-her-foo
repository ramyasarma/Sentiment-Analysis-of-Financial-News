             Serena Williams , the world’s No. 1
ranked women’s tennis player, has pulled out of tournaments in
Istanbul, Cincinnati and Montreal after cutting her right foot
on a broken glass while at a restaurant.  
 Williams, 28, was injured last week and will require
surgery, the  WTA Tour said  on its website without giving details
of the incident.  
 “I’m so upset I won’t be able to play in the upcoming
events,” Williams said in a  statement . “Thank you for all of
your support. I can’t wait to get back on the courts.”  
 Williams, who two weeks ago collected her 13th major
tournament title with a victory at Wimbledon, was set to play in
the Istanbul Cup starting July 26.  
 She’ll also miss WTA Tour events starting Aug. 9 and 16 in
Cincinnati and Montreal, respectively. It isn’t clear how the
injury will affect her preparation for the U.S. Open, the
season’s final major championship, which is scheduled to begin
Aug. 30 in Flushing Meadows, New York.
