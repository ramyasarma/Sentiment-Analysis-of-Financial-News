             New Zealand beat South Africa 31-17
in the second match of rugby’s Tri-Nations tournament in
Wellington.  
 Ma’a Nonu, Mils Muliaina, Rene Ranger and Israel Dagg
scored the tries for the All Blacks in Wellington, with  Dan Carter  kicking eight points and  Piri Weepu  adding three. Danie
Rossouw and  Schalk Burger  touched down in reply for South
Africa.  
 “When you play against the best in the world, that’s when
you test yourself,” New Zealand captain  Richie McCaw  said in a
televised interview. “It’s good to have the points on the board
and we deserve a rest now.”  
 South Africa now heads to Brisbane to play Australia in the
third match of the annual southern hemisphere championship next
Saturday.  
 Weepu took over as kicker after Carter missed three
conversions and three penalties. Danie Rossouw was sin binned in
the fourth minute, and the Kiwis took advantage, scoring two
tries before he came back on the field.
