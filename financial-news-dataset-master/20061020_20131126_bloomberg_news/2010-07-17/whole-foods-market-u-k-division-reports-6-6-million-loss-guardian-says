             Whole Foods Market Inc.  posted a
loss of 4.3 million pounds ($6.6 million) at its U.K. division
as the recession curbed spending on organic produce and the
company closed an unprofitable store, the Guardian reported.  
 Sales in the year ended September, which fell 12 percent to
43 million pounds, were hurt after its Bristol store closed, the
newspaper said. The retailer is seeking to expand in London, the
Guardian reported, citing company accounts.
