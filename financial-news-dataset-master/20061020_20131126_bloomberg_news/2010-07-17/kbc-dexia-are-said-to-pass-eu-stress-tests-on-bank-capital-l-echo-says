             KBC Groep NV and Dexia SA are said
to have passed their stress tests, L’Echo said, citing “certain
sources” whom it did not name. “The two banks are said to be
sufficiently capitalized to face possible storms,” L’Echo said.
The Belgian government will not have to work out rescue plans
for the country’s banks, according to L’Echo. KBC is Belgium’s
biggest bank and insurer by market value and Dexia is Belgium’s
biggest bank by assets.
