             BP Plc said pressure continues to
grow slowly inside its damaged Gulf of Mexico well, with no sign
of damage that would prevent the company from keeping the well
sealed, Kent Wells, BP senior vice president for exploration and
production, said in a conference call. BP will continue to run
tests on the well, he said.
