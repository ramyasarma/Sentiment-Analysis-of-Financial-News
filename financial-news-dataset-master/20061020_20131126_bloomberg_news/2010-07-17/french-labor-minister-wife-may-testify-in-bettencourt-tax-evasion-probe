             French Labor Minister  Eric Woerth 
and his wife Florence have asked to testify as witnesses in an
investigation into possible tax evasion by  L’Oreal SA  heiress
 Liliane Bettencourt , Woerth’s lawyer said in an interview.  
 Florence Woerth worked as a financial adviser to
Bettencourt before stepping down from the job last month. In an
interview with French radio station Europe 1 on June 23, she
said she was unaware of any tax irregularities.  
 French daily Le Monde  reported  today that Patrick de
Maistre, Bettencourt’s financial adviser, told police he hired
Woerth’s wife after the minister asked him to meet with her and
give her advice on her career. The newspaper cited excerpts of
police transcripts it claims to have seen.  
 The Le Monde article “does not put Mr. Woerth in
difficulty in any way,” Jean-Yves Le Borgne, his lawyer, said
in a telephone interview today. “It contains information that
was already known; there is nothing new.”  
 The Woerths “have asked to be heard on all the elements
contained in the article published by Le Monde,” Le Borgne
said. A date for the testimony has not been fixed yet, he said.  
 De Maistre and three other people close to Liliane
Bettencourt were released yesterday after being held by police
over the probe, Astrid Granoux, a spokeswoman for the Nanterre
prosecutor’s office, said by telephone today. Granoux didn’t
return calls seeking comment on the story published by Le Monde.
