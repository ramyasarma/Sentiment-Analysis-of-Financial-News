             Fiat SpA, Italy’s biggest carmaker,
agreed with banks to refinance 4 billion euros of debt before
the spinoff of the company’s industrial unit,  Il Sole 24 Ore 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Fiat reached an accord with Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Unicredit
SpA, BNP Paribas SA, Calyon, Societe Generale SA, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc, and each
bank will contribute 500 million euros to the deal, it said.  
 About 2.4 billion euros will be used as a bridge loan for
the spinoff, the Italian daily reported. A Fiat spokesman
declined to comment on the report when contacted by Bloomberg.
