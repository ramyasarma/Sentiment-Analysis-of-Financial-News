             The International Monetary Fund said
the Hungarian government must do more to boost revenue and
should restructure loss-making state enterprises. In an e-mailed
statement today, the Washington-based lender said the new
government’s proposed tax on the banking industry will affect
growth and lending. The IMF said the government’s budget deficit
targets are an “appropriate anchor,” though more needs to be
done. “While there is much common ground, a range of issues
remain open,” the IMF said in the statement.It will continue to
talk to the government “with a view to bridging remaining
differences.”
