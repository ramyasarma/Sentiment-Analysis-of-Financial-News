             Cocoa-bean purchases by a U.K. hedge
fund contributed to an increase in the commodity’s price this
week, the Financial Times reported, citing traders.  
 Armajaro Holdings Ltd. took delivery of 240,100 metric tons
of cocoa yesterday, the newspaper reported. That was the biggest
delivery from London’s Liffe exchange since 1996 and is equal to
about 7 percent of the annual global production, it said.
