             The Ontario Provincial Police’s so-
called anti-rackets division raided on July 14 a Toronto
building that contains offices for several government
ministries, the Toronto Star reported, citing unidentified
sources.  
 There is an investigation into “irregular transactions”
between staff in some government ministries and private
companies, the Star said, citing OPP spokeswoman Linda Cranney.  
 Ron McKerlie, deputy minister of government services, said
in a  statement , “We understand there is an ongoing OPP
investigation that concerns individuals working in the Ontario
government,” and “staff are fully cooperating.”  
 The OPP raided the building that contains offices of
provincial ministries of health, energy and infrastructure and
the Ontario Realty Corp., the newspaper said on its website.
