             Chelsea has made a club-record 50
million-pound ($77-million) offer for Liverpool striker Fernando
Torres, the Sun reported.  
 Blues owner Roman Abramovich has stepped up his efforts
after Liverpool rejected 40 million pounds last week and said it
would not welcome any further bids for the 26-year-old World Cup
winner, the Sun said.  
 Abramovich is hoping the increased offer will draw the
Reds’ attention after the club failed to reach the lucrative
Champions League, the newspaper said. Torres has scored 72 goals
in 116 games since joining Liverpool from Atletico Madrid in
2007.
