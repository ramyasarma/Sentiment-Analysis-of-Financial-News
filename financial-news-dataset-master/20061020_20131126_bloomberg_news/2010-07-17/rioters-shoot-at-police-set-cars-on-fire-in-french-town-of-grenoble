             Rioters in Grenoble fired at police,
torched cars, and wielded stones and baseball bats, according to
public officials in the city in southeast France.  
 “A group of people was waiting for us with stones and
baseball bats in their hands,” Brigitte Jullien, head of public
security,  told  France’s BFM TV today. “Shots were fired against
us.” Jerome Safar, a deputy mayor in the city, told the
television channel that rioters also set fire to cars.  
 Clashes started following a memorial service for 27-year-
old Karim Boudouda, killed the day before in a shootout with
police after allegedly robbing a casino near Grenoble,  Le Figaro 
reported, citing unidentified police officials. As many as 60
cars were torched and two youths arrested, the daily said.  
 Interior Minister  Brice Hortefeux  will visit Grenoble
today, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement. Police
officials weren’t immediately available for comment in the city.
