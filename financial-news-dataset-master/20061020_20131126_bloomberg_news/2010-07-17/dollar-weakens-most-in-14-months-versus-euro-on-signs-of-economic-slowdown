             The dollar fell the most against the
euro in 14 months and dropped to the lowest level this year
versus the yen as economic reports added to evidence that the
U.S. recovery is losing momentum.  
 The greenback touched a level weaker than $1.30 versus the
shared currency as minutes of the Federal Reserve meeting last
month indicated policy makers trimmed their forecasts for
growth. The euro rallied for a third straight week against the
dollar before partial results of stress tests on the region’s
banking system due on July 23.  
 “It’s really dollar weakness based on some evidence the
economy is slowing,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency
strategist at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. “The economic
indicators are pointing strongly toward slower growth in the
second half of the year.”  
 The dollar declined 2.24 percent, the most since May 2009,
to $1.2930 per euro yesterday, from $1.2641 on July 9. It
touched $1.3008 yesterday, the weakest level since May 10. The
U.S. currency dropped 2.3 percent to 86.57 yen, from 88.62 yen,
after reaching 86.27 yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 1.
The euro was little changed at 111.96 yen, compared with 112.01.  
 The euro has rallied 8.9 percent versus the dollar since
reaching a four-year low of $1.1877 on June 7 as concern eased
that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis would undermine the region’s
economic recovery.  
 Spain, which has the third-largest deficit in the euro
region, drew higher demand in its sale of 3 billion euros ($3.8
billion) of 15-year bonds on July 15. It attracted bids worth
2.57 times the securities offered, compared with 1.79 in an
April auction.  
 Stress Tests  
 Stress tests of European banks aren’t likely to force major
publicly listed lenders to bolster their capital by selling new
shares, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  
 “We do not expect large listed European banks to raise
equity as a result of the stress tests,” London-based Goldman
Sachs analysts, including  Jernej Omahen  and  Frederik Thomasen ,
wrote in a report to clients dated yesterday.  
 The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain dropped to 27,050 on July 13, compared with
record net shorts of 113,890 in May, figures from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed yesterday.  
 Brazil’s real slid 3.8 percent to 48.59 yen and Australia’s
dollar declined 3.3 percent to 75.22 yen as a drop in stocks and
commodities discouraged demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 1.2 percent after
rallying 5.4 percent last week. Crude oil for August delivery
decreased 0.4 percent to $75.71 a barrel.  
 Fed Minutes  
 Minutes of the Fed’s June meeting indicated that U.S.
central bankers were concerned about lingering high unemployment
and risks that inflation could decelerate further. If the
outlook worsened, the Federal Open Market Committee would need
to consider whether additional stimulus was appropriate, the
minutes said.  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to 66.5 in July, the
lowest since August 2009. The median forecast of 62 economists
in a Bloomberg News  survey  was for a decline to 74. The New York
Fed’s general economic index and the Philadelphia Fed’s gauge
both fell in July to 5.1, reflecting the slowest pace of
manufacturing expansion this year.  
 Traders cut bets to 13 percent that the U.S. central bank
will increase its benchmark rate by its December meeting, down
from a 27 percent probability a month earlier, according to CME
Group Inc. futures.  
 ‘Poor’ Data  
 “The poor economic data has helped weaken expectations for
any increases in U.S. interest rates,” said  Yuichiro Harada ,
senior vice president of the foreign-exchange division in Tokyo
at Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest publicly
traded bank in terms of assets.  
 Canada’s dollar dropped against all of its major
counterparts on evidence of weakness in the U.S., the nation’s
biggest trading partner.  
 The loonie weakened 2.3 percent to C$1.0582 per U.S.
dollar, from C$1.0337 last week. It touched C$1.0584 yesterday,
the weakest level since July 7. The currency fell 4.6 percent to
81.81 yen and lost 3.8 percent to C$1.6193 per pound.  
 Bank of Canada policy makers will increase the  target
lending rate  by a quarter-percentage point to 0.75 percent at
their meeting on July 20, according to all 19 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The central bank became on June 1 the
first among the Group of Seven nations to lift borrowing costs
when it increased its benchmark from a record low 0.25 percent.
