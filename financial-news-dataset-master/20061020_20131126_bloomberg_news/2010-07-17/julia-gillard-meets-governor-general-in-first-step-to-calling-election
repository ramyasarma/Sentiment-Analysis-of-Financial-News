             Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  met with Governor-General  Quentin Bryce  as a formality
before calling a national election.  
 Gillard arrived at Bryce’s office at Government  House  in
Canberra at 10:39 a.m. She must ask Bryce, Australia’s head of
state, to dissolve parliament before setting an election date.
Gillard is scheduled to hold a media conference at noon in
Canberra.  
 Polls indicate a tight race between the incumbent and the
challenger. Support for Gillard’s Labor party support fell three
percentage points to 52 percent in a Nielsen poll published July
12, compared with three weeks previously.  Tony Abbott ’s
opposition Liberal-National coalition’s popularity rose three
points to 48 percent.  
 Labor has 83 lawmakers in the 150-member House of
Representatives, there are 63 Liberal-National coalition members
and four independents, according to the Australian parliament’s
website. There are four independents.
