             Treasury  two-year note  yields fell
to a record low as reports showed that consumer confidence
plunged to the lowest level in a year and retail sales declined,
heightening concern the economic recovery is stalling.  
 Yields on  10-year notes  traded near a 14-month low this
week after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June meeting showed
policy makers noted that risks to the recovery increased.
Housing starts and sales of existing homes declined last month,
reports next week are forecast to show.  
 “The economic data just keeps coming in softer,” said
 James Combias , New York-based head of Treasury trading at Mizuho
Financial Group Inc., one of the 18 primary dealers that trade
with the central bank. “The bond market is pricing in the real
possibility of slower growth.”  
 The benchmark 10-year note  yield  fell 14 basis points, or
0.14 percentage point, to 2.92 percent yesterday in New York,
from 3.06 percent on July 9, according to BGCantor Market Data.
It touched 2.88 percent on July 1, the lowest level since April
2009. The price of the 3.5 percent security due in May 2020 rose
1 5/32, or $11.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 104 29/32.  
 The two-year  note  yield dropped for the seventh straight
week, falling 4 basis points to 0.59 percent and touching its
lowest level ever, 0.5765 percent.  
 ‘Diet of Bad News’  
 Ten-year yields touched 4.01 percent on April 1, the
highest level since October 2008.  
 “We’ve moved a long way in a short period of time,” said
 Tom Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. “To maintain these low levels, we need a
diet of bad news. Some days we get it.”  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment tumbled to 66.5 this month, from 76
in June, data showed yesterday. The forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a decline to 74. U.S. retail sales fell in June
more than forecast, 0.5 percent, after a revised 1.1 percent
drop in May, a Commerce Department report said on July 14.  
 The consumer price index slipped 0.1 percent in June, the
third straight monthly decrease, a Labor Department report
showed yesterday. The 0.9 percent year-over-year gain in core
consumer prices, which excludes food and energy, matched the
smallest since 1966, it showed.  
 “Inflation is very low and consistent with the idea that
the Fed is continuing to shift their broader concerns to a
potential disinflationary environment,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. “It’s all part and parcel of the same underlying
theme of a low-inflation story, which suggests the Fed leaves
the zero interest-rate policy in place for longer.”  
 ‘Risk of Deflation’  
 Central bank policy makers at last month’s meeting lowered
their outlook for inflation this year to a range of 1 percent to
1.1 percent, from 1.2 percent to 1.5 percent in April. They cut
an estimate for 2010 growth to a range of 3 percent to 3.5
percent, from 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent in April. A few
officials expressed concern at about “some risk of deflation,”
according to minutes released July 14.  
 The Fed has kept its benchmark interest  rate  in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. Futures on the CME
Group Inc. exchange yesterday showed a 13 percent chance it will
raise the  target rate  for overnight bank loans by at least a
quarter-percentage point by December, compared with a 27 percent
likelihood a month ago.  
 “The Fed is on record talking about deflation, which they
haven’t in some time,” said  Thomas Tucci , head of U.S.
government bond trading in New York at primary dealer Royal Bank
of Canada. “When the Fed starts to identify things by name,
that means it is seriously on their minds.”  
 Stocks Tumble  
 Stocks dropped, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index
falling 1.2 percent.  
 Housing starts slipped to 2.2 percent in June from a month
earlier, economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast before a
Commerce Department report on July 20. The National Association
of Realtors will say on July 22 that sales of existing homes
last month fell 9.9 percent, according to another survey.  
 Global demand for long-term U.S. financial  assets  slowed in
May from a month earlier as investors abroad sold stocks and
accumulated Treasuries at the weakest pace in a year.  
 Net buying of long-term equities, notes and bonds totaled
$35.4 billion for the month, compared with net purchases of
$81.5 billion in April, the Treasury Department reported
yesterday. Total net foreign purchases of  Treasury notes  and
bonds were $15 billion in May, the weakest level since May 2009
and down from $76.4 billion in April.  
 The U.S. sold $69 billion of notes and bonds this week:
$35 billion in three-year securities, $21 billion in 10-year
debt and $13 billion in 30-year bonds.
