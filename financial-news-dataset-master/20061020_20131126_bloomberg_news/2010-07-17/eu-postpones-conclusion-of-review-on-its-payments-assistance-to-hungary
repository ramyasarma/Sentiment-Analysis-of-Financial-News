             The European Commission said today
it was postponing the conclusion of the review of its balance of
payments assistance to Hungary and would return for further
discussions later.   
 “Hungary has returned to a positive economic
growth path and now has one of the lowest budget deficits in the
EU. I welcome the authorities’ commitment to the 2010 deficit
target,” said Olli Rehn, commissioner for Economic and Monetary
Affairs, according to a statement released in Brussels.  
 “However, the correction of the excessive deficit by next year
will require tough decisions, notably on spending. Care will
also be needed to ensure a stable environment for both domestic
and international investors.”   
 The commission said it was working in close cooperation 
with International Monetary Fund staff on the review, according
to the e-mailed statement.
