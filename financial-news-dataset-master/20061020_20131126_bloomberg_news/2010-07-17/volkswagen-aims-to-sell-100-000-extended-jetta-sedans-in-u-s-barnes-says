             Volkswagen AG , Europe’s largest
carmaker, aims to sell more than 100,000 units of a new version
of its best-selling Jetta sedan in the U.S. a year, according to
the interim chief of the VW brand in the country.  
 “The new Jetta will be a very nice volume product for
us,”  Mark Barnes , who was appointed last month to run
Volkswagen of America, said in a July 16 telephone interview.
“The goal is to bring the masses to Volkswagen who currently
believe they cannot afford a Volkswagen.”  
 The new Jetta, VW’s first model altered specifically for
the U.S. market, is 3.5 inches longer than the European version.
The model accounted for half the brand’s 214,000 U.S. deliveries
in 2009, excluding the Audi luxury brand, and 44 percent of the
total in the first six months of this year.  
 Volkswagen cut the price for the extended Jetta, which goes
on sale in October, to about $16,000 from the current base of
$17,735. The reduction brings the model closer to the starting
prices of  Toyota Motor Corp. ’s Corolla and Honda Motor Co.’s
Civic, now at $15,450 and $15,455 respectively, according to
company websites.  
 VW aims to sell 1 million cars and sport-utility vehicles
in the U.S. by 2018, with its Audi luxury division accounting
for 20 percent of that figure. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based
manufacturer is aiming to dethrone  Bayerische Motoren Werke  AG
as the largest luxury-car maker.  
 Chattanooga Plant  
 A new assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, will
probably begin production in the third quarter of 2011, Barnes
said in the interview. VW is using the factory to produce a
sedan that is bigger than other VW cars for U.S. customers.  
 “We’ll have the new product in late third quarter or early
fourth quarter,” Barnes said.  
 Asked whether there is room for a second model, Barnes
said: “Certainly there’s enough room down there to expand, but
our focus is clearly on the new mid-sized sedan.”  
 The Jetta is produced in a VW plant in Puebla, Mexico,
which has capacity to make 450,000 cars after an expansion that
has been ongoing since July 2009.  
 VW said June 24 that it was holding contract talks with
U.S. chief  Stefan Jacoby . At the same time, it named  Michael Lohscheller , who had been in charge of finance in the U.S. since
2007, to run Volkswagen Group of America on an interim basis,
while Barnes would do the same for the Volkswagen brand until
Jacoby’s contractual situation is clarified.  
 Jacoby’s Exit  
 The negotiations focused on Jacoby’s contractual
obligations to the German carmaker before he takes over as CEO
at Volvo Cars, people familiar with the matter said June 25.  
 Excluding Audi, VW aims to more than double U.S. deliveries
to 450,000 by 2012 to 2013, Jacoby said in January.  
 Volkswagen’s preferred shares  added  18 cents, or 0.2
percent, to 76 euros in Frankfurt June 16, bringing their gains
this year to 16 percent and valuing the carmaker at 34.1 billion
euros ($44.1 billion).
