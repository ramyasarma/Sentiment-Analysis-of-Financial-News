             South Africa’s Louis Oosthuizen
leads Paul Casey of England by two strokes in the third round of
the British Open at St. Andrews. Tigers Woods is seven shots
behind.  
 Second-round leader Oosthuizen bogeyed the first hole on
the Old Course before making four straight pars and is 11-under.
Casey has three birdies over his first six holes to move into
second place.  
 Mark Calcavecchia, who began the day second at 7-under, has
dropped to even-par. The 1989 Open winner started with three
straight bogeys and added a quadruple-bogey 9 at the fifth hole.
Woods is even-par through 12 holes and 4-under for the
tournament.
