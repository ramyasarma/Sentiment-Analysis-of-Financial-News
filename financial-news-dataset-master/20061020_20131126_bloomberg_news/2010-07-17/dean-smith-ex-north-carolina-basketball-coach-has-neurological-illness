             Former University of North Carolina
basketball coach  Dean Smith  has memory loss, according to a
statement released by his family.  
 “What other people may have noticed -- and what has been
speculated about recently in the media -- is that our dad may
not remember quite like he used to,” the  statement  said. “It’s
a stark contrast, because he is widely known for remembering a
name, a place, a game, a story -- it’s what made other people
feel like they were special, because our dad remembered
everything.”  
 Smith, 79, coached the Tar Heels from 1961 to 1997, winning
two national championships before retiring as college
basketball’s all-time leader with 879 wins. He now ranks second
to  Bob Knight , who passed him in 2007.  
 Smith has a progressive neurocognitive disorder that
affects his memory, his family said.  
 “He may not immediately recall the name of every former
player from his many years in coaching, but that does not
diminish what those players meant to him or how much he cares
about them,” the statement said.  
 Smith was enshrined in the  Basketball Hall of Fame  in 1983.
Smith’s family said the former coach still enjoys an active
lifestyle and “treasures” his relationships with current Tar
Heels coach  Roy Williams  and his former players, friends and
family.  
 “Throughout his career, he has always preferred the
spotlight be on the Carolina basketball program and the
University, rather than himself,” Smith’s family said. “We
hope that you will understand and respect his wishes.”
