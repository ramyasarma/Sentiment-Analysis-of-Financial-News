             Alexandre Vinokourov  of Kazakhstan
won stage 13 of the Tour de France after a solo breakaway near
the end of the 122-mile ride. Luxembourg’s  Andy Schleck  of Team
Saxo Bank kept the race-leading yellow jersey.  
 Schleck retains a 31-second advantage over defending
champion  Alberto Contador  of the Astana team as the riders head
for the Pyrenees mountains tomorrow.  Mark Cavendish  of Team HTC-
Columbia came second in a sprint finish.  
 Vinokourov, who was banned for a year for blood doping in
2007, was in front for much of the race and the peloton was
unable to catch him in the final stages of a mainly flat ride
from Rodez to Revel.  
 “My ambition on the Tour was to win a stage,” the Astana
rider said in a televised interview. “It didn’t happen
yesterday but it did today. For me and my family, it’s
exceptional.”  
 Cavendish of the U.K. emerged from a pack of riders behind
Vinokourov to maintain his challenge for the sprinters’ green
jersey, currently held by Italy’s  Alessandro Petacchi .  
 Earlier, seven-time champion  Lance Armstrong  crashed before
reaching the start line. Armstrong fell on the 4-mile ride to
the start before getting back on his bike and rejoining the
other 176 riders still in the race, letour.com said.  
 Armstrong is 36th in the overall standings, more than 25
minutes behind race leader Schleck after finishing in a group 4
minutes and 35 seconds back in today’s stage.
