             Three Yemeni Shiite Muslim rebels
were killed and five wounded in an army ambush yesterday, said
Yousef al-Faishi, a spokesman for the insurgents.  
 Government accusations that the al-Houthis rebels earlier
killed 11 people including three soldiers in the northern Majaz
district were untrue, Al-Faishi said in a statement.  
 Al-Houthis attacked vehicles in Majaz, according to an
interior ministry statement yesterday. The ministry said the
group aimed to disrupt peace efforts in the north of the
country, where a cease-fire has been in force since Feb. 12.  
 Rebels have been fighting what they say is discrimination
by Yemen’s majority Sunni Muslims in Saada province since 2004.
Neighboring majority-Sunni Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil
exporter, became involved in the conflict in November, after
fighters killed a Saudi soldier during a cross-border incursion.  
 Several cease-fires between the Yemeni government and
rebels have collapsed. Yemen accuses al-Houthis of trying to
reinstall Shiite religious rulers overthrown in 1962.
