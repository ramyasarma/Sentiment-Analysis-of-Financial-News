             Saudi shares dropped for a fourth
day, led by  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , after U.S. and
European stocks and crude oil prices declined.  
 The  Tadawul All Share Index  fell 64.6 points, or 1.1
percent, to 6,110.2 at 2:01 p.m. in Riyadh, the lowest since
July 7. Saudi Basic, the world’s largest petrochemical maker,
fell 1.3 percent, knocking about 11 points off the index.  Samba
Financial Group  and  Al Rajhi Bank  also declined.  
 “Profit taking that priced in the earning seasons and
jittery international markets led to today’s decline,” said
 John Sfakianakis , chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi in
Riyadh.  
 Southern Province Cement Co. , the largest cement producer
in Saudi Arabia, dropped as much as 4.4 percent to 66 riyals
after its second-quarter profit declined 13 percent to 185
million riyals ($49 million) on lower sales.  
 Zain Saudi Arabia  retreated as much as 1.2 percent, the
most in two weeks, to 8 riyals. The unit of Kuwait’s largest
mobile-phone company  Zain  said its second-quarter loss narrowed
to 632 million riyals from 857 million riyals a year earlier on
higher subscriptions.  
 Saudi Basic, or  Sabic , dropped 1.1 percent to 87 riyals.
Samba fell 2.6 percent, the largest intraday loss since June 5,
to 56 riyals. Al Rajhi retreated as much as 1.6 percent to 75.2
riyals.  
 “The Saudi market exhibits strong directional mode from
the U.S. market and yesterday’s correction is felt today, but
not to the same degree,” Sfakianakis said.  
 U.S., European and developing-nation markets fell this
week. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 1 percent, while
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  lost 1.2 percent. The Stoxx 600
fell 0.8 percent.  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index , which tracks developing-
nation equity markets, retreated for a second day yesterday,
dropping 0.9 percent to 948.9, the lowest since July 8.  
 Crude oil declined 0.1 percent this week and closed at
$76.01 yesterday. Saudi Arabia holds a fifth of the world’s
proven oil reserves.  
 “Trading is expected to remain volatile, with many market
participants on the sidelines during the summer vacations,”
said Younas Malick, senior economist at the National Commercial
Bank in Jeddah. The volume of shares traded on Tadawul was 41.5
million at 1:15 pm, compared with this month’s daily average of
112.4 million.  
 “Now we need to wait and see SABIC’s results expected
later this week and the possible short-term momentum it might
give,” Sfakianakis said. Sabic traditionally releases quarterly
results within a month after the end of a quarter.  
 Saudi Arabia’s index is the only Gulf Arab index tracked by
Bloomberg that trades on Saturday.
