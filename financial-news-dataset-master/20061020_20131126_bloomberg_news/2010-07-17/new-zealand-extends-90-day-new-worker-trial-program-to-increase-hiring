             New Zealand will allow all companies
to fire new workers within 90 days of hiring without risking a
legal challenge, a measure aimed at boosting employment.  
 The rule, which currently applies to companies with fewer
than 20 workers, has encouraged employers to boost hiring, Prime
Minister  John Key  said in a speech in Auckland today.  
 “We are giving many more businesses the increased
confidence to hire new employees, and giving many more people a
chance to prove themselves in the job market,” Key said.
