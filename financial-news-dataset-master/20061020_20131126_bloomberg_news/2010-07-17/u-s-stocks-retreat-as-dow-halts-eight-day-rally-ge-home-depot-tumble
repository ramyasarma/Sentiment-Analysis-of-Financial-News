             U.S. stocks fell, ending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average ’s longest winning streak in two months,
following worse-than-estimated sales at Bank of America Corp.,
Citigroup Inc. and General Electric Co. and consumer confidence
that sank to the lowest level in a year.  
 Bank of America and Citigroup dragged financial companies
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a 2.9 percent loss, the
most among 10 industries.  Home Depot Inc.  slumped 4.1 percent,
helping lead declines among consumer companies, after U.S.
retail sales dropped for a second month in June. GE slipped 2.7
percent after missing revenue forecasts.  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.  rallied 5.9 percent on its $550 million settlement of the
federal government’s fraud lawsuit.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  lost 1.2 percent to
1,064.88 this week. It had jumped 7.1 percent between July 2 and
July 13. The  Dow  slipped 100.13 points, or 1 percent, to
10,097.90 and broke an eight-day winning streak on July 15.  
 “The market is trying to figure out what’s this economy
going to look like, what are earnings going to look like a year
from now -- the news we’ve been seeing doesn’t paint a very
pretty picture,” said  Malcolm Polley , who oversees $1 billion
as chief investment officer at Stewart Capital Advisors in
Indiana, Pennsylvania. “The consumer’s tapped out, and there’s
really no reason to see him coming back any time real soon.”  
 Europe, Oil Spill  
 The S&P 500 has lost 13 percent since April 23 amid concern
the European debt crisis will slow global growth and after BP
Plc’s Gulf of Mexico oil spill drove down energy stocks. On July
14, the Commerce Department said sales at U.S. retailers fell
0.5 percent in June. Yesterday, the Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment decreased to
66.5, the lowest since August and less than the most pessimistic
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Second-quarter earnings  season started this week when Alcoa
Inc. posted profit of 13 cents a share, more than analysts
projected, as higher metal prices boosted sales. S&P 500
companies are projected to increase profits by 34 percent in
2010 and 18 percent in 2011, the fastest two-year gain since
1995, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Of the 23 companies in the S&P 500 that reported since July
12, all but three have topped forecasts for earnings per share,
Bloomberg data show. Revenue for the group that has reported so
far has increased 2.6 percent, with 17 of 23 companies beating
the average analyst estimates, according to the data.  
 Two Quarters Away  
 Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender, lost 7.5 percent
to $13.98 this week, after second-quarter  net income  and sales
slid and Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said
“sustained activity” won’t come for at least two more
quarters. Citigroup shares fell 3.5 percent to $3.90.  
 GE, the world’s largest maker of jet engines and power-
plant turbines, reported second-quarter sales of $37.4 billion,
missing the average analyst estimate by 2.3 percent. The stock
retreated 2.7 percent to $14.55.  
 “We got some really good earnings news, as expected, but
the disappointment came on the revenue side,” said  Wasif Latif ,
who oversees $18 billion of U.S. equity funds at USAA Investment
Management Co. in San Antonio. “Sooner or later the top line
has to kick in and start growing.”  
 Google Inc., the owner of the world’s most popular search
engine, missed  analyst  profit estimates after ramping up
spending to compete with Facebook Inc. The shares decreased 1.7
percent to $459.61.  
 Higher Expenses  
 Mattel Inc., the world’s largest toymaker, slumped 7.8
percent to $20.81. Fees from a lawsuit and higher personnel
costs raised expenses and profit missed analysts estimates in
the second quarter.  
 Apple Inc. declined 3.7 percent to $249.90. The company
announced plans to give every  iPhone 4  buyer a free rubberized
case called a Bumper in an effort to address complaints about
lost reception. Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs  said
yesterday that Apple was “working our butts off” to figure out
the problem, after Consumer Reports decided not to recommend the
phone, blaming the antenna glitch.  
 Financial firms declined the  most  of 10 S&P 500 industry
groups, slumping 2.9 percent. Shares of industrial companies,
energy businesses and raw-material producers lost more than 1.8
percent each.  
 Stocks reversed gains from the previous week, when the S&P
500 rallied on an improved outlook for the economic recovery. A
government report that week showed U.S. retail sales grew at the
fastest pace in four years, while the International Monetary
Fund raised its growth forecast for 2010.  
 ‘Sell the Rallies’  
 Investors should “sell the rallies” as the S&P 500 will
soon enter a correction, falling to between 944 and 1,000 at the
end of the third quarter, according to  Michael Riesner  and Marc
Mueler, technical analysts at UBS AG. The rise last week negated
a so-called head-and-shoulders formation in which prices form
three consecutive peaks, with the middle being the highest.  
 Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history,  increased 5.9 percent  this week to $146.17. The New
York-based firm agreed to pay $550 million and change business
practices to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
claims that it misled investors in collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages.  
 Boeing Co. fell 4.3 percent this week to $61.90 after
saying it may delay the delivery of its 787 Dreamliner to 2011
from late this year. The Chicago-based company is still working
to get the composite-plastic jet to launch customer All Nippon
Airways Co. by the end of 2010.  
 Vivus Inc. plunged the most in the  Russell 2000 Index  of
small companies, losing a record 53 percent to $5.41. U.S.
reviewers recommended against approval of its Qnexa diet pill,
citing the potential risks of depression, birth defects and
increased heart rate. The decision may threaten makers of
competing drugs, analysts said.
