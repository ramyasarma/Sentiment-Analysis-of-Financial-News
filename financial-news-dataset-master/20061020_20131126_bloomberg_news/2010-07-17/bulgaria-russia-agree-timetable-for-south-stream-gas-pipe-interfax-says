             Russia and Bulgaria today agreed on
the  OAO Gazprom -led South Stream pipeline project and lower gas
prices for Bulgaria, Interfax reported today.  
 The “roadmap” for the gas pipeline with an annual
capacity of 63 billion cubic meters sets a timeline for the
project, the Russian news service said.  
 Bulgaria’s section of South Stream that will carry natural
gas from Russia across the Black Sea to western Europe is
estimated to cost $835 million, Energy Minister  Traicho Traikov 
said July 16.
