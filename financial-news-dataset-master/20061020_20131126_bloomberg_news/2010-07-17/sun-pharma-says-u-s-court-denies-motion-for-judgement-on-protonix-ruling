             Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,
India’s largest drugmaker by market value,  said a U.S. court
denied its motion for judgment as a matter of law seeking to
reverse an earlier jury verdict in a patent litigation over the
generic Protonix heartburn treatment.  
 The detailed opinion of the U.S. District Court for New
Jersey has not yet been issued, Sun Pharma said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company “continues to believe that the
patent is invalid and unenforceable and will pursue all
available legal remedies, including appeals,” it said.
