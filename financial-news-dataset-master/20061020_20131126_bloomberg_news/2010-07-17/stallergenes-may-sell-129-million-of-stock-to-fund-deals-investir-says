             Stallergenes SA  could raise as much
as 100 million euros ($129 million) in a stock sale to help
finance acquisitions should takeover opportunities arise,
 Investir  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer  Albert Saporta .  
 Europe’s second-largest maker of allergy medicines still
aims to find a partner to market its grass-pollen product in the
U.S. by the middle of next year, Saporta told the French weekly
newspaper in an  interview  published today.  
 Such a partner could eventually buy a stake in the French
company, Saporta told Investir. A sale of Stallergenes cannot be
ruled out although this isn’t the company’s goal, Saporta told
the newspaper.
