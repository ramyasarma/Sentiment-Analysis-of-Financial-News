             An oil leak after a pipeline
explosion at the Dalian New Port in northeast China has been
sealed off and further pollution prevented after valves were
shut, China National Petroleum Corp. said.  
 The explosion was sparked during the offloading of an oil
tanker yesterday at 6:20 p.m., CNPC said today in a statement on
its website. The fire was extinguished and the company is
investigating the accident, which didn’t harm anyone, it said.  
 The crude oil storage facilities at the Dalian port site
contain six tanks, each with capacity of 100,000 tons, CNPC
said.  
 More than 2,000 firefighters worked overnight battling the
flames and the incident drew attention from the country’s top
leaders, including President  Hu Jintao , the Xinhua News Agency
reported.  
 Mao Zefeng , the company’s spokesman, couldn’t be
immediately reached on his mobile phone.
