             Goldtrail Travel Ltd., a U.K.-based
travel operator of flights and holiday packages to Turkey and
Greece, has ceased trading, the Civil Aviation Authority said on
its  web site  today.  
 Steps have been taken “to protect customers booked with
Goldtrail Travel Limited after the company ceased trading” late
yesterday, the CAA said.  
 The company has an estimated 16,000 customers currently on
holidays overseas, the British Broadcasting Corp.  reported .  
 New Malden, Surrey-based Goldtrail traded as Goldtrail
Holidays, Goldtrail Travel and Sunmar, according to the CAA.  
 “There are no more outbound Goldtrail flights,” the
statement said. “The CAA will be making arrangements to ensure
customers of Goldtrail can fly home at the end of their holiday.
The majority of flights from Turkey are expected to operate as
planned. There may be some changes to flights from Greece and
information will be provided by local representatives at the
airports involved.”
