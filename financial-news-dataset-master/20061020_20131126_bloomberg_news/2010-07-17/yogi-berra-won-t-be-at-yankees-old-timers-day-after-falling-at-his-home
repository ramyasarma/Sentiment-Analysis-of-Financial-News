catcher Yogi Berra won’t be at the team’s Old-Timers Day this
afternoon after falling at his home last night.  
 “"Yogi fell down last night near our house, and suffered
some bruises,” his family said in a statement. “He is now
recovering at home.”  
 The Yankees will be honoring late owner George Steinbrenner
and former public-address announcer Bob Sheppard at the event.  
 Berra, 85, lives in Montclair, New Jersey.
