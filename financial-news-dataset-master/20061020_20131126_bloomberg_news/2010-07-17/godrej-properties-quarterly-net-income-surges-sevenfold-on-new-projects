             Godrej Properties Ltd. , the Indian
real estate company controlled by billionaire  Adi Godrej , said
first-quarter profit rose more than sevenfold as it started
selling projects in the cities of Ahmedabad and Kolkata.  
 Net income climbed to 224 million rupees ($4.7 million) in
the three months ended June 30 from 29.8 million rupees a year
earlier, according to a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange
today. Sales more than doubled to 412 million rupees.  
 Mumbai-based Godrej was the only major Indian property
developer to sell shares in an initial public offering last
year, planning to use the funds to reduce  debt  and build
projects. India faces a shortage of 24.7 million homes,
according to government data.  
 The second phase of the project in Ahmedabad, the capital
of western Gujarat state, was fully sold in two days, the
company said in a statement. More than 50 percent of the project
in Kolkata, the capital of the eastern state of West Bengal, was
sold in its first phase, according to the statement.  
 Godrej Properties shares have increased 44 percent to a
record 704.45 rupees since the company made its Mumbai trading
 debut  on Jan. 5. That compares with a 2.3 percent increase in
the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive index.
