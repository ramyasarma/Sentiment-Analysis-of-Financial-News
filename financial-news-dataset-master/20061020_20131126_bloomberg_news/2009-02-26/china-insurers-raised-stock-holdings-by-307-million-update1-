             Chinese insurers increased stock
holdings by 2.1 billion  yuan  ($307 million) in January, the
insurance regulator said in response to what it called an
erroneous media report that insurers cut investments by 10.1
billion yuan.  
 Insurers bought 13.76 billion yuan of shares last month and
sold a combined 11.64 billion yuan, China Insurance Regulatory
Commission said in a  statement  on its Web site today. It didn’t
say which media report it was responding to.  
 The companies’ equity holdings rose by 6.5 percent from the
end of 2008 to 258.3 billion yuan at the end of January, and
accounted for 8.5 percent of their total investments, the
statement said.  
 The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.9 percent to
close at 2121.25 today, after slumping as much as 4.7 percent.
