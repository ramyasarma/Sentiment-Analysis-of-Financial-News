             Maanshan Iron & Steel (600808)  Co., China’s
fourth-largest steelmaker by value, said 2008 profit was
estimated to have fallen 71 percent because of higher raw
material and fuel costs and a drop in the value of inventories.  
 Net income was about 717 million yuan ($105 million) last
year, compared with 2.48 billion yuan a year earlier, the
Maanshan, Anhui province-based company said today in a statement
to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The estimated results were
calculated under Chinese accounting standards.  
 Maanshan Steel (323)  joined rivals  Angang Steel Co. (347)  and  China
Oriental Group Co. (581)  in forecasting profit declines as a global
recession has curbed demand by builders and carmakers. Steel
demand in China, the world’s largest user of the metal, may
improve in the second or third quarter as the government’s
stimulus measures kicks in, the China Iron and Steel Association
Vice Chairman  Luo Bingsheng  said Feb. 23.  
 Maanshan Steel fell for a fifth day, down 3.7 percent to
HK$2.36 today in Hong Kong. The stock has fallen 14 percent this
year, compared with a 10 percent drop in the benchmark Hang Seng
Index.  
 China’s steelmakers had an aggregate loss of 29.1 billion
yuan in December after losing 12.8 billion yuan in November and
5.84 billion yuan in October, the steel association has said.
