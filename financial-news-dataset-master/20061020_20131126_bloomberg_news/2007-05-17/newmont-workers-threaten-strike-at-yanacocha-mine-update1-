             Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  said workers at
its Peruvian unit Minera Yanacocha SRL, the world's largest gold
mine, threatened to strike after rejecting a wage offer.  
 Employees turned down a proposal to increase monthly wages
by an average of 48 percent, the unit said today in an e-mailed
statement. The three-year offer includes annual 14 percent
increases in base wages, plus a bonus of 13,000 soles ($4,100).  
 A strike probably wouldn't affect production at the mine in
 Peru 's northern  Andes  because the mine's workers union
represents fewer than half of Yanacocha's 3,000 employees,
Newmont spokesman  Omar Jabara  said today.  
 ``We're preparing for the worst but hoping for the best,''
Jabara said in a phone interview from Denver, where Newmont is
based. ``The fact negotiations are continuing and that there
hasn't been a strike yet are a sign that things are advancing.''  
 Workers are demanding 21 percent increases in base wages,
part of an industrywide push by miners for a greater share of
record profits for mining companies that sparked a five-day
national strike earlier this month. Labor talks at Yanacocha
have been under way since Feb. 4.  
 Newmont's shares fell for a fourth day, dropping 57 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $39.07, a 20-month low. New York-traded
shares in Lima-based Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA, which owns a
44 percent stake in Yanacocha, rose for the first day in six,
gaining 16 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $32.63.  
 Gold futures for June delivery fell $4.30, or 0.7 percent,
to $658.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest close in eight weeks.
