             China's stocks rose, climbing the
most among markets included in global benchmarks and driving the
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  to a record.  
 China United (600050)  Telecommunications Corp. and ZTE Corp. climbed
on speculation the government will award licenses for the
country's high-speed mobile-phone network after setting
technology specifications.  
 ``The introduction of the new standards raised expectations
of the issuance of 3G licenses and that gave a boost to telecom
carriers and manufacturers, which are likely to benefit from the
introduction of 3G,'' said Yan Ping, an analyst at Haitong
Securities Co. in Shanghai.  
 The CSI 300, which tracks yuan-denominated A shares listed
on China's two exchanges, gained 78.32, or 2.1 percent, to close
at 3778.60, surpassing the previous high set on May 14.  
 China United, which controls the nation's second-largest
cell phone operator, climbed 0.14  yuan , or 2.3 percent, to 6.30.
ZTE, China's biggest publicly traded phone-equipment maker, rose
1.71 yuan, or 3.8 percent, to 46.30. Guomai Technologies Inc.,
which provides network technical support, gained 1.80 yuan, or
4.1 percent, to 46.  
 The government will adopt wideband code division multiple
access, or WCDMA, and CDMA2000 technologies for the nation's
third-generation mobile-phone networks, according to  Wang Lijian ,
a Beijing-based spokesman at the Ministry of Information
Industry.  
 China's telephone carriers may spend 150 billion yuan ($20
billion) to build 3G mobile networks, according to Francis Cheung, head of Asian telecommunications research at CLSA Ltd.
in Hong Kong.  
 Vanke Sales  
 ``Telecom operators stand to benefit as the new technology
allows them to offer more services that they can charge for,''
said Gabriel Gondard, deputy chief investment officer at Fortune
SGAM Fund Management Co. in Shanghai, which manages $3.5 billion
in assets.  
 China  Vanke (000002)  Co. led property stocks higher after the
company said sales rose 22 percent last month.  
 Vanke, the nation's biggest property developer, jumped 0.81
yuan, or 5.2 percent, to 16.31. The company said its property
sales totaled 2.49 billion yuan ($325 million) in April,
compared with 2.04 billion yuan the previous month.  
 Poly Real Estate Group Co., China's third-largest developer
by market value, gained 1.05 yuan, or 3.4 percent, to 32.23.
Gemdale Corp., a Chinese developer that partnered with ING Groep
NV, surged 1.51 yuan, or 5.9 percent, to 27.25.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China's stock exchanges, rose 1.6 percent to 4048.29. The
 Shenzhen Composite Index (SZCOMP) , which covers the smaller one, added
2.5 percent to 1151.85.
