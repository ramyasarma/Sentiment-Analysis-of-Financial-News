Equinox Minerals Ltd ., owner of
Africa’s biggest copper mine, said it agreed to buy Melbourne-
based  Citadel Resource Group Ltd.  for about A$1.25 billion
($1.23 billion) to expand its copper operations.  The agreement to buy Citadel, which is developing Saudi
Arabia’s biggest copper deposit, will have Equinox swap one
share for every 14.3 Citadel shares, plus pay A$0.105 cash for
each Citadel share, the West Perth, Australia-based company said
today in a statement.  After the deal closes, Equinox shareholders will own about
81 percent of the combined company and Citadel shareholders will
own 19 percent. A message left with Citadel’s Melbourne office
after hours wasn’t immediately returned.  Equinox Chief Executive Officer  Craig Williams  said earlier
this month that he’s looking for acquisitions to add to the
company’s Lumwana project in Zambia. He said in an Oct. 15
interview that he’d like another “advanced asset” that could
be anywhere in the world and be in production within two years.  Equinox’s $841 million Lumwana mine, Zambia’s largest
foreign investment project, began production in 2008 and Equinox
this month increased its forecast output for this year by 3.7
percent to 140,000 metric tons of concentrate.  Citadel CEO  Ines Scotland  said in a June interview that
he’s interested in boosting its stake in Saudi Arabia’s Jabal
Sayid deposit beyond 70 percent. Citadel planned to start
production at the A$280 million copper-gold development by the
fourth quarter of next year, he said at the time.  (Equinox and Citadel will host a joint conference call to
discuss the transaction on Oct. 25 at 07:30 a.m. Perth/ 10:30
a.m. Sydney time at +1-800-822-994. The companies will also host
a call in North America, at 9 a.m. Toronto time at +1-877-317-
