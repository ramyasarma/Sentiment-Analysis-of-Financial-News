German companies such as Commerzbank
AG, HeidelbergCement AG and Volkswagen AG have blocked social
media sites such as Facebook and Twitter because of security
concerns,  WirtschaftsWoche  said, citing company spokespeople.  Daimler AG and Linde AG have restricted access to social
media sites at certain locations because of productivity
concerns, the weekly reported. A survey of German companies by
Clearswift showed that 56 percent feared that social network
sites represent a security threat, while 30 percent were
concerned about productivity, WirtschaftsWoche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
