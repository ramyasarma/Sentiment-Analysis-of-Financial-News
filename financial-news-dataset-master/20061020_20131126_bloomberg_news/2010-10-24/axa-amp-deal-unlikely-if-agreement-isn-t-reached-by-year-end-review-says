AMP Ltd., which is in talks with AXA
SA to renew its bid for Axa Asia-Pacific Holdings Ltd., is
unlikely to finalize a transaction if an agreement isn’t reached
by the end of the year, the Australian Financial Review reported
in its Street Talk column, without saying where it got the
information. AMP needs to increase its original offer, valued at
A$5.15 a share based on its Oct. 22 closing price, the
newspaper said. AMP might offer more cash or agree to swap its
Asian businesses in return for increasing the total price paid
for AXA Asia, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
