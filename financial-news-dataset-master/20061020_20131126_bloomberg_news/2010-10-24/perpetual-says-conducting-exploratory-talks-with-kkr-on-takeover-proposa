KKR & Co. ’s A$1.75 billion ($1.72
billion) bid for Perpetual Ltd. doesn’t reflect fair value, the
Australian asset manager said as it agreed to provide financial
information and enter talks with the private equity group.  “Shareholders’ interests are best served by conducting
exploratory discussions with KKR,” Sydney-based Perpetual said
in a statement today. “These discussions should allow the board
to establish if an offer that would deliver acceptable value to
Perpetual’s shareholders is likely to be formulated.”  New York-based KKR offered last week to pay as much as A$40
a share for the company to tap expanding wealth in the world’s
fourth-biggest pool of managed funds. The purchase of Perpetual,
whose shares had slumped almost two-thirds from a peak in 2007,
would be the biggest acquisition of an Australian fund manager
in a decade.  “As part of the exploratory discussions, Perpetual is
prepared to provide KKR with limited financial information,”
today’s statement said. “Perpetual will advise shareholders as
to the outcome of the discussions with KKR as soon as is
practicable,” and the process may take “some time,” it said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
