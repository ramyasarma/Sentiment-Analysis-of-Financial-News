German stocks rose, lifting the
benchmark DAX Index to its highest since June 2008, after Group
of 20 finance chiefs pledged to avoid “competitive
devaluation” as they sought to calm fears of a global trade
war.  Volkswagen AG  jumped 6.8 percent after Credit Suisse Group
AG and Deutsche Bank AG raised their estimates for Europe’s
largest carmaker and  Hochtief AG  gained after Spiegel reported
the German builder is in talks with Qatar about taking a stake.
 ThyssenKrupp AG  and  Salzgitter AG , the country’s largest
steelmakers, followed metal prices higher.  The benchmark  DAX Index  climbed 0.5 percent to 6,639.21 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, its highest level since June
2008. The measure has rallied 6.6 percent this month amid
speculation policy makers at the U.S. Federal Reserve will
announce another round of asset purchases at their November
meeting in a bid to jumpstart economic growth. The broader HDAX
Index also rose 0.5 percent today.  “The G20 meeting is widely seen as a success despite that
the most important decisions were postponed,”  Christian Blaabjerg , chief equity strategist at Saxo Bank A/S in
Copenhagen, said today. “It seems as if only the German finance
minister got things right by saying a combination of cutting
back public spending, keeping wages at a level where competition
isn’t hurt while balancing off strong dependency on exports are
the major factors explaining the country’s  economic success.
The markets will view this as positive. Risk in general and
equities will fly this.”  G20 Talks  G-20 finance ministers and central bankers ended talks in
South Korea on Oct. 23 saying they will refrain from
“competitive devaluation” and let markets set foreign-exchange
values more. The dollar weakened as the pledge damped
speculation governments will buy the currency to weaken their
own.  Volkswagen climbed 6.8 percent to 103.35 euros, up 14
percent in the past four days. Deutsche Bank analysts raised
their earnings before interest and taxes estimate by 31 percent
for 2010, 22 percent for 2011 and 26 percent for 2012, according
to a report sent to clients. The bank also raised its price
estimate for the preferred shares by 25 percent to 125 euros.
Credit Suisse raised its price estimate to 130 euros from 102
euros.  Hochtief advanced 2.1 percent to 64.80 euros, its fourth
gain. Qatar is in talks with the company about taking a stake to
help thwart a hostile takeover bid by Spain’s Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA, Spiegel reported.  The shares of chipmaker  Infineon Technologies AG  climbed
2.4 percent to 5.80 euros as the Philadelphia Semiconductor
Index headed for the highest in almost three months.  Henkel, Steelmakers  Henkel AG , the maker of Loctite Super Glue and Persil
detergent, increased 1.2 percent to 43.23 euros. MF Global
reiterated a “buy” recommendation, saying in a note it expects
the company to raise its full-year guidance. Henkel is due to
release quarterly results on Nov. 10.  ThyssenKrupp and Salzgitter gained 2.3 percent to 27.12
euros and 2.3 percent to 55.25 euros, respectively, as metal
prices advanced. Copper rose to the highest price in more than
27 months in London as the dollar weakened amid speculation that
the Federal Reserve will unveil further bond purchases next
week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
