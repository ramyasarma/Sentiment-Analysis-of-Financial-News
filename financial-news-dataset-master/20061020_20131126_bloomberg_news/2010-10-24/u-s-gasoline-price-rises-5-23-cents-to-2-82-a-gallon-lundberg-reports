The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 5.23 cents to $2.8237 a
gallon, according to a survey.  The price covers the two-week period ended Oct. 22 and is
determined from data provided by 2,500 filling stations
nationwide to  Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst
in Camarillo, California.  The higher price was mostly caused by a “surge” in crude
oil prices in late September and early October, Lundberg said.
Crude futures rose more than 12 percent in the three weeks
ending Oct. 8. While the price has slipped since then, the
earlier run-up is now being felt “at the street level where we
buy gasoline,” Lundberg said in a telephone interview.  The falling value of the U.S. dollar over the past month,
and not demand for motor fuels, explains most of the price
increase, Lundberg said.  The  Dollar Index , which  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.  uses
to track the dollar against the currencies of major U.S. trading
partners, has fallen 4.8 percent since Sept. 21, when the
Federal Reserve said it was poised to ease monetary policy to
help the economy recover from the worst recession since the
Great Depression.  The Energy Department reported on Oct. 20 that crude
 inventories  at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New
York futures, fell 1.05 million barrels, or 3 percent, to 34
million in the week ended Oct. 15, the biggest decline since
January. The decrease left stockpiles at the lowest level since
April 9.  Crude Oil Prices  The front-month contract for crude oil fell 97 cents in the
two weeks ended Oct. 22, losing 1.2 percent to $81.69 a barrel.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 8.74 cents, or 4.1
percent, to $2.0638 a gallon in the two weeks.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  rose 1.16 million barrels to 219.3
million, the first increase in four weeks.  Demand  for gasoline, as measured by what refiners and
blenders supply to wholesalers, rose 0.9 percent to an average
8.89 million barrels a day. The four-week average was 1.4
percent below a year earlier.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump rose 2.7 percent in the
week ended Oct. 15 after falling 0.7 percent the prior week,
according to  MasterCard Inc.  in its SpendingPulse report.  On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $3.01 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.10 a
gallon.  The highest price in the continental U.S. was in San
Francisco, at $3.16 a gallon. The cheapest place to buy the fuel
was St. Louis, where a gallon averaged $2.59, according to
Lundberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
