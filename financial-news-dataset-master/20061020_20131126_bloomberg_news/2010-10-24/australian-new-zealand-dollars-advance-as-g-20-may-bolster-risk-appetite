The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose on speculation a pledge by Group of 20 officials to
avoid weakening currencies will calm concern over trade
tensions, bolstering demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Australian dollar gained to 98.77 U.S. cents as of 5:58
a.m. in Sydney from 98.28 cents on Oct. 22 in New York. New
Zealand’s currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 74.99 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
