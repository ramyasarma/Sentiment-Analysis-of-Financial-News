An overview of activity since
markets closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES  New York: U.S. stocks rallied for a third straight week as
earnings and forecasts at companies from Coca-Cola Co. to Boeing
Co. beat estimates and traders speculated the Federal Reserve
will purchase debt to stimulate the economy.
*The S&P 500 advanced 0.6 percent to 1,183.08 for the week. It
closed at 1,184.71 on Oct. 18, the highest level since May 3.
*The Dow increased 69.78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,132.56.
*Both measures have risen in seven of the past eight weeks.  London: European stocks climbed for a third week, the longest
stretch of gains since June, as companies from Nokia Oyj, the
biggest maker of mobile phones, to Danone and Ericsson AB
reported results that topped analysts’ estimates.
*The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.4 percent to 266.75 for the
week.  Hong Kong: Asian stocks fell for the first week in two months
after China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy,
unexpectedly raised interest rates and said it grew at the
slowest pace in a year.
*The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.86 percent for the week to
129.90, halting the gauge’s seven straight weekly gains.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.6
percent to 4,648.20 in Sydney. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
climbed 0.8 percent to 3,289.75 in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  Sydney: The dollar fell against the euro and the yen after Group
of 20 finance ministers and central bankers vowed to avoid
weakening currencies to lift exports. Officials called for more
sustainable current-account gaps without embracing a U.S.
proposal for targets, as they ended talks in South Korea on Oct.
23.  The Australian and New Zealand dollars rose for a second day on
speculation a pledge by Group of 20 officials to avoid weakening
currencies will calm concern over trade tensions and spur demand
for higher-yielding assets.
*The U.S. dollar slid to $1.3983 as of 5:34 a.m. in Sydney, from
$1.3954 on Oct. 22 in New York.
*It weakened to 81.26 yen from 81.38 yen.
*Australia’s currency climbed to 98.71 U.S. cents as of 6:09 a.m.
in Sydney from 98.28 cents in New York on Oct. 22.
*New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.5 percent to 75.05 U.S. cents and
bought 60.93 yen from 60.78.  COMMODITIES  New York: Gold futures fell, capping the biggest weekly slide
since early July, as the dollar rebounded, eroding demand for
the precious metal as an alternative investment.
*Gold futures for December delivery fell 50 cents to settle at
$1,325.10 an ounce at 2 p.m. Friday on the Comex in New York.  METALS  New York: Copper prices rose on speculation the dollar’s rally
will stall, boosting demand for metals as alternative
investments.
*Copper futures for December delivery rose 1.55 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $3.797 a pound at 1:22 p.m. Friday on the
Comex. Earlier, the price dropped as much as 0.8 percent as the
dollar fluctuated.  OIL  New York: Crude oil rose on speculation that growing French
demand for imported fuel because of a strike will reduce
stockpiles elsewhere and on concern that a tropical storm may
strengthen and head toward Mexican oil fields.
*Crude oil for December delivery rose $1.13, or 1.4 percent, to
settle at $81.69 a barrel Friday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract dropped 0.3 percent for the week.  WHAT TO WATCH:
