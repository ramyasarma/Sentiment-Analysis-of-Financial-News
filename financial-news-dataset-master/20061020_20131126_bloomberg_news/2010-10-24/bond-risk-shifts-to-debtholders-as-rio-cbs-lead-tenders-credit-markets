Not since 2004 have borrowers had as
much incentive to tender for their bonds, prompting companies
from mining firm  Rio Tinto Plc  in London to New York-based
television network  CBS Corp.  to redeem debt.  Companies tendered for $30.5 billion of bonds last month,
the most since April, and are on pace to buy an additional $24.3
billion this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 rally  in corporate debt has pushed yields to 181 basis points
below coupons on average, near the widest gap since March 2004.  While borrowers typically entice investors to give up their
bonds by paying them a premium, debt holders are faced with
having to re-invest the proceeds at a time when fixed-income
assets are paying some of the lowest rates on record.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  sold $5 billion
of debentures on Oct. 18, including $750 million of three-year,
0.75 percent notes and $1.25 billion of five-year, 1.5 percent
debt, coupons that are the least on the record for those
maturities, according to Bank of America Corp.  “Risk is being transferred from companies to investors,”
said  Christian Weber , a Frankfurt-based strategist at UniCredit
SpA. Investors who reinvest in longer-dated debt “will lose
their gains as overall yields are pushed back up from these very
low levels,” he said.  Falling Yields  A measure of company bond yields that takes into account
the risk that the debt will be redeemed -- the so-called yield-
to-worst -- has dropped to an average 3.44 percent from 4.49
percent a year ago, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. During that time, the average bond coupon has
declined to 5.25 percent from 5.46 percent. The difference
between yields and coupons reached as much as 191 basis points
on Oct. 11.  “There’s quite an incentive to retire outstanding debt and
replace it with lower-coupon newly issued bonds to reduce the
cost of debt capital,” said  John Lonski , chief economist at
Moody’s Capital Markets Group in New York. “The effect of
refinancing has been overwhelmingly positive for corporate
credit.”  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield-to-maturity
that investors demand to hold corporate bonds worldwide rather
than government debt fell for a third week last week. In
emerging markets, bond spreads rose the most since August after
falling for three weeks. Prices on leveraged loans declined,
following seven straight increases.  Spreads on company bonds from the U.S. to Europe and Asia
ended the week at 167 basis points, or 1.67 percentage points,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market
Corporate index. That’s a decline of 1 basis point since Oct. 15
and 6 basis points this month. Average yields rose to 3.45
percent from 3.43 percent a week earlier.  Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or speculate on creditworthiness, fell
2.7 basis points last week to 96.2 basis points, according to
prices from Markit Group Ltd. The index, which has fallen from
106.7 at the end of September, reached 95.5 on Oct. 13, the
lowest since May 3. In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of
125 companies with investment-grade ratings dropped 2.7 to 99.2.  The indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves
and rise as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  In emerging markets, relative yields rose 9 basis points
for the week, to 253 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. index data. That’s the biggest increase since spreads rose
17 basis points in the week ended Aug. 27.  Loans, Sales  The  Standard & Poor’s/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 Index  fell
0.02 cent to 91.07 cents on the dollar. Prices on the  index ,
which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien
leveraged loans, reached 91.14 cents on Oct. 14, the highest
since May 13.  The $5 billion four-part offering from  Wal-Mart , the
largest retailer, led $64.7 billion of corporate bond sales
worldwide last week, a 13 percent decrease from the period ended
Oct. 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Rio Tinto Finance, a unit of the world’s third-largest
mining company, is seeking to buy back as much as $2.5 billion
of 5.875 percent notes due July 2013, according to an Oct. 20
statement. The securities it’s offering to buy rose 1.8 cents to
113.5 cents on the dollar on Oct. 20, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Authority.  The company, which is financing the offer with cash, will
issue longer-term bonds with maturities that haven’t been
decided, said David Ovington, a spokesman for Rio Tinto in
London.  CBS Tender  CBS, owner of the most-watched U.S. television network,
tendered for $250 million of debt this month as the broadcaster
sought to push out maturities by selling new bonds.  “The exercise also appears aimed at taking advantage of
much lower interest costs,” according to an Oct. 5 report by
 Jake Newman , an analyst for CreditSights Inc., a bond-research
firm based in New York.  The broadcaster was willing to pay 113.1 cents on the
dollar for its 8.625 percent debentures due in August 2012 and
107.9 cents for 5.625 percent debt maturing in August 2012, he
estimated in the report. To help pay for the tender, CBS sold
$300 million of 4.3 percent notes due in February 2021 and $300
million of 5.9 percent, 30-year bonds, Bloomberg data show.  The 30-year debt, which initially was “particularly well-
received by the market,” Newman wrote, has declined 2.4 cents
since issuance, Trace data show.  Benchmark Yields  Investors have snapped up longer-term debt, whether issued
in a new bond sale or as a replacement for existing notes after
a tender, because they offer higher yields at a time when
investments from commercial-real estate debt to government debt
are paying diminishing coupons.  Sales of bonds with maturities of 10 years or more averaged
$102 billion a month last quarter, up from $51 billion in the
three months ended June 30 and $84 billion average from January
to March, global issuance data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Borrowers “are opportunistically loading on debt,” said
UniCredit’s Weber. “They regard the burden to be more
manageable than facing uncertain capital markets down the
road.”  Benchmark government bond yields are also being kept lower
by policy makers’ attempts to stimulate growth. Ten-year U.S.
Treasuries yield 2.55 percent, down from 3.83 percent at the
start of the year. Similar-maturity German bund yields, Europe’s
benchmark government security, fell to 2.47 percent, from 3.43
percent at the start of 2010.  ‘Cheap’ Funding  The Federal Reserve has held its target overnight  lending
rate  between banks in a range of zero percent to 0.25 percent
since December 2008 as it seeks to stoke economic growth. The
European Central Bank’s main refinancing rate has been at a
record-low 1 percent since May 2009.  “Companies can get longer-dated financing at extremely low
rates” through tenders “and cheap long-term funding is one of
the boxes that CFOs want to tick,” said Benjamin Bennett, a
credit strategist who helps manage the equivalent of $125
billion of corporate bonds at Legal & General Investment
Management Ltd.  Bombardier Inc. , a commercial airplane manufacturer, issued
780 million euros ($1.1 billion) of 10 1/2-year bonds on Oct. 22
as part of an exchange and tender offer, according to the
Montreal-based company. The Montreal-based maker of Learjet is
tendering for floating-rate notes due in 2013 and 8 percent
senior notes maturing in 2014.  Accellent Tender  Accellent Inc. , a maker of medical equipment that’s owned
by private-equity firm KKR & Co., sold $315 million of senior
subordinated notes due in 2017, according to Bloomberg data. The
proceeds may be used to finance a tender for the Wilmington,
Massachusetts-based issuer’s 10.5 percent senior subordinated
notes due in 2013.  Bouygues SA , a French construction, television and
telecommunications company, is offering to repurchase bonds due
in 2013 and 2014 and issue at least 500 million euros of longer-
dated notes, three people with knowledge of the sale said. The
Paris-based company will buy back up to 900 million euros of
debt under the tender expiring Oct. 25, the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
