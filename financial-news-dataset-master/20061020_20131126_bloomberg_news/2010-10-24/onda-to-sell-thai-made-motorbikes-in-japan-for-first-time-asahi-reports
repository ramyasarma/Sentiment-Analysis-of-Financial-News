Honda Motor Co. will start importing
motorbikes produced in Thailand for distribution in Japan as it
seeks to sell them more cheaply amid shrinking domestic sales,
the Asahi newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information. It will be the first time Honda has imported
motorbikes, with engine displacement of more than 250cc, that
are made outside Japan and with the aim of selling them
domestically, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
