Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. may need to
raise more capital to fund future expansions after splitting its
casino business from its betting shops, the Australian Financial
Review reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Elmer Funke
Kupper. While existing plans are covered in the A$430 million
equity raising announced last week, any further growth would
need new financing, the newspaper said. The company can either
undertake a capital raising -- its most likely option -- or cut
dividend payouts to shareholders in the casino unit, which alone
is unlikely to provide enough funds, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
