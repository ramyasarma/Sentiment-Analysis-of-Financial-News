League leader PSV Eindhoven
subjected Feyenoord to a club-record 10-0 defeat today in Dutch
soccer’s Eredivisie.  Jonathan Reis got three goals, and Jeremain Lens and Balazs
Dzsudzsak each got two. Ibrahim Afellay, Ola Toivonen and
Orlando Engelaar were the other scorers as PSV equaled its
record victory.  PSV was already 1-0 up when the visitors were reduced to 10
men after 34 minutes as Kelvin Leerdam was red-carded.  PSV leads the standings by two points from champion FC
Twente, which defeated Den Haag 3-2.          To contact the editor responsible for this story:
