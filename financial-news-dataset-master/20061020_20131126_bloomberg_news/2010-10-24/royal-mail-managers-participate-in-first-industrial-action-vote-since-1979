Royal Mail Group Ltd. managers are
set to be balloted on industrial action for the first time since
1979, the labor union Unite said.  A total of 8,535 union members across Royal Mail,
Parcelforce and Post Office Ltd. are due to vote from the start
of November over plans by the postal service to cut around 1,500
jobs, Unite said in an e-mailed statement today.  “If Royal Mail are allowed to push ahead with forced
redundancies it will keep coming back for more, so Unite intends
to stop Royal Mail in its tracks,” Paul Reuter, national
officer for Unite, said in the statement.  The U.K.’s 360-year-old service is struggling to compete
with  TNT NV  of the Netherlands, Deutsche Post AG’s DHL Worldwide
Express unit and  Business Post Group Plc  as European Union rules
phase in competition for deliveries between 2011 and 2013.  “We continue talking with Unite and have stressed we will
continue doing our utmost to manage any job losses by voluntary
means and that we have increased our existing voluntary
redundancy package,” Royal Mail said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
