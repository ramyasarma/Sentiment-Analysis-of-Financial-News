Support for Scottish independence
has risen by six percent since Prime Minister  David Cameron 
formed a coalition government following the U.K. general
election in May, Scotland on Sunday  said , citing a YouGov Plc
poll commissioned by the newspaper.  The survey shows backing for Scotland’s separation from the
rest of Britain has risen to 34 percent from 28 percent since
May. Those against an independent Scotland was 50 percent, down
from 58 percent over the same period, the newspaper said. It did
not give the number of people polled or the margin of error.  Scotland’s First Minister  Alex Salmond , who is leader of the
Scottish National Party, told Sky News today the poll shows his
party has a higher level of support than when it was first
elected in 2007. “There’s not many governments can claim after
three-and-a-half years to have more support than when we
started,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
