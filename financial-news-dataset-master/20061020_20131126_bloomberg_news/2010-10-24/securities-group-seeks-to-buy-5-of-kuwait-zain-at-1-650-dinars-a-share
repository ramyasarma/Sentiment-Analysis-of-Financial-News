Securities Group Co., a Kuwait-based
investment management firm, said it received a request from
investors to purchase more than 5 percent of Mobile
Telecommunications Co. at 1.650 dinars a share, the company said
in an advertisement in  Al-Rai  today.  Securities Group will prioritize shareholders owning no
more than 50,000 shares of Zain, and will start the procedures
to purchase the shares today, according to the advertisement.  Securities Group said Emirates Telecommunications Corp.’s
offer of 1.7 dinars a share to buy 46 percent of Zain, as Mobile
Telecommunications is known as, is "fair," according to the
advertisement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
