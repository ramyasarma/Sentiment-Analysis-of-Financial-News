One quarter of France’s gas stations
are without fuel as protesters opposing President Nicolas
Sarkozy’s pension overhaul cut supply and block refineries, the
President’s top social aide said.  The refiners’ group  Union Francaise des Industries
Petrolieres  said shortages may worsen tomorrow as truck drivers
transporting fuel couldn’t make deliveries today,  Agence-France
Presse  reported today citing the UFIP.  Raymond Soubie, Sarkozy’s aide, said supply will resume
’’slowly, progressively’’ and that seven districts, mainly in
western France, still faced shortages, on  Europe 1 radio  today.  The shortages are disrupting France’s week-long All-Saints
holiday, which started Oct. 22. Soubie also said that he will
stand down from his job at the end of November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
