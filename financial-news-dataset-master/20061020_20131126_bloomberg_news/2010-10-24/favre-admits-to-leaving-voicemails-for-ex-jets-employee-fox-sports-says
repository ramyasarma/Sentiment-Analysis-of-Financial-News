Brett Favre  admitted to leaving
voicemails for a female former New York Jets employee and denied
sending her lewd photographs,  Fox Sports said on its website ,
without revealing where it got the information.  Favre, the Minnesota Vikings’ quarterback, accepted
responsibility for the voice messages during a meeting with
National Football League security officials last week, the
report said.  Favre, 41, is accused of sending mobile communications of a
sexual nature to the woman two years ago, while he played for
the Jets, Fox Sports said. Favre, a three-time NFL Most Valuable
Player, hasn’t commented publicly on the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
