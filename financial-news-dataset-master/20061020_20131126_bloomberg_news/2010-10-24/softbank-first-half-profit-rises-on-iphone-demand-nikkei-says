Softbank Corp.’s first-half
operating profit is likely to have risen 40 percent to 320
billion yen as the popularity of Apple Inc.’s iPhone boosted
mobile subscribers, Nikkei English News said, without citing
anyone.   Sales likely reached 1.45 trillion yen, up about 100
billion yen from a year earlier, the report said.  Net income may have increased about 10 percent to 80
billion yen, the report said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
