French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
popularity fell to a record low this month, with less than one
third of those questioned approving his performance, an Ifop
survey for the  Journal du Dimanche  showed.  The president’s approval rating fell to 29 percent, against
32 percent in September, the lowest since his May 2007 election,
the weekly newspaper reported today, citing an opinion poll by
the Paris-based institute.  Sarkozy has faced almost two months of protests and strikes
since sending a bill to  Parliament  that proposes overhauling the
country’s pensions system and adding two years to the minimum
retirement age. Journal du Dimanche called the protest  “An
Anti-Sarkozy Movement”  on today’s front page.  Prime Minister  Francois Fillon ’s support rate, which had
remained positive through the crisis, also fell. The proportion
of dissatisfied respondents, 51 percent, outnumbered the 47
percent of respondents who said they approved his performance,
the survey showed.  Paris-based Ifop called 1,828 respondents over the age of
18 between Oct. 14 and 22. It did not publish margins of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
