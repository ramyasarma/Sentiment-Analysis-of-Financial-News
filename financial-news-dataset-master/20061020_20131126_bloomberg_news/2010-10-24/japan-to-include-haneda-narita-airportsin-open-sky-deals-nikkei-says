Japan will include Tokyo’s Haneda
and Narita airports in an “Open Skies” agreement with the U.S.
to free up air travel, Nikkei English News said, without citing
anyone.   Japan also aims to revise completed agreements with Asian
governments to include the two airports, the report said.  The government has changed its position because the number
of landing slots are scheduled to increase at both airports, the
Nikkei said.  Japan aims to sign open skies agreements with China,
Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines and other regions, the report
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
