 Fiat SpA Chief Executive Officer
Sergio Marchionne said the Italian carmaker’s domestic business
will still be unprofitable this year.  Fiat on Oct. 21 raised its target for 2010 earnings before
interest, taxes and one-time items to at least 2 billion euros.  “None of those earnings will be made in Italy,”
Marchionne said in Milan in an interview with state television
RAI. “We still have a loss.”  Marchionne was commenting on the carmaker’s measures to
raise productivity at Italian plants. Fiat plans to invest 20
billion euros through 2014 in Italy to improve plants and
vehicle development if unions agree to curb strikes and add
shifts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
