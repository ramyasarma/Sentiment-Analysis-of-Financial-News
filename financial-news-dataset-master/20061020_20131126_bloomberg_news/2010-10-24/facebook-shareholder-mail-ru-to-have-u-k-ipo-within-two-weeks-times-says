Mail.ru Group Ltd., a Russian
internet holding company part-owned by billionaire Alisher
Usmanov, may sell stock in an initial public offering in London
within two weeks, the Sunday Times reported.  Advisors to the company, which may be valued at up to $5
billion, accelerated the plan after last week’s IPO of Betfair
Group Ltd., a British Internet gambling site, the Times said.  Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Russia’s state-run VTB
Capital, two of the firms hired to manage Mail.ru’s sale,
circulated pre-market research among investors last week, the
Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
