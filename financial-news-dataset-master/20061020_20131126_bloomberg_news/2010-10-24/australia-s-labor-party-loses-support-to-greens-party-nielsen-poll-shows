Australia’s Julia Gillard increased
her lead as preferred prime minister while support for her
ruling Labor party has fallen since the Aug. 21 election,
according to an opinion survey.  Labor fell 4 percentage points to 34 percent, Tony Abbott’s
Liberal-National coalition fell 1 percentage point to 43 percent
and the Greens rose 2 percentage points to 14 percent, according
to the survey published in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
The coalition leads Labor at 51-49 on a two-party measure,
according to the telephone survey of 1,400 voters on Oct. 21-23,
meaning there has been little change for the major parties since
the deadlocked election after which Gillard formed minority
government.  Gillard leads as preferred prime minister by 53 percent to
Abbott’s 39 percent, 3 percentage points higher than on the eve
of the election, according to the report on the survey that
didn’t show a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
