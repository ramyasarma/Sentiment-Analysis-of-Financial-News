Roger Federer  tied  Pete Sampras  on
64 men’s singles tennis titles after beating  Florian Mayer  in
straight sets to win the Stockholm Open final today.  The 29-year-old Swiss, ranked No. 2 by the ATP Tour, won 6-
4, 6-3 against Germany’s Mayer for his third title this year. It
comes a week after he lost to Scotland’s Andy Murray in the
Shanghai Masters final.  Only Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe have won
more titles than Federer. Connors tops the list with 109, Lendl
has 94 and McEnroe 77.  Federer  recovered today from having his serve broken in the
seventh game of the opening set and completed his victory in
just over an hour. Mayer, playing his third final, is still
without a title.  Serbia’s  Viktor Troicki  claimed his first title with a 3-6,
6-4, 6-3 victory against Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in the
Kremlin Cup final in Moscow.  In the women’s final, Victoria Azarenka of Belarus beat
Russia’s  Maria Kirilenko  6-3, 6-4. Italy’s  Roberta Vinci  took
the Luxembourg Open title in straight sets against Julia Goerges
of Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
