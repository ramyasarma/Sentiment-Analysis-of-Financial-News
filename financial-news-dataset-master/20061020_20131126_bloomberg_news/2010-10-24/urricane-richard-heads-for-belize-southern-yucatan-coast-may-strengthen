Tropical Storm Richard strengthened
to a hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per
hour, as it moves to the west-northwest at 12 mph toward the
coast of Belize, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  The storm is expected to reach the coast by this evening
and move over land tonight and tomorrow, the Miami-based center
said in its latest advisory at 11 a.m. New York time.  Richard may produce rainfall of as much as 6 inches (15
centimeters) over Honduras’s Bay Islands, Belize and the
southern Yucatan Peninsula, the center said. The storm is
expected to strengthen a bit more before moving over land, the
hurricane center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
