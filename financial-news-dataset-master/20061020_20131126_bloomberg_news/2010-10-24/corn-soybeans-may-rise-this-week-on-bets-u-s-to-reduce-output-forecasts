Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on speculation the U.S. Department of Agriculture will cut
forecasts for this year’s crops.  Seventeen of 33 traders and analysts surveyed from Chicago
to Tokyo on Oct. 22 said corn will climb, and 18 of 34
respondents said soybeans will advance. Last week, corn futures
for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to $5.60 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean futures for January delivery
rose 1.3 percent to $12.115 a bushel. The USDA will issue its
crop projections on Nov. 9.  Last week’s gain in soybeans was expected by the majority
of respondents surveyed on Oct. 15, while the drop in corn was a
surprise. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 51 percent
of the time for corn and 53 percent for soybeans.  Bullish  on corn: 17   Bullish  on soybeans: 18
