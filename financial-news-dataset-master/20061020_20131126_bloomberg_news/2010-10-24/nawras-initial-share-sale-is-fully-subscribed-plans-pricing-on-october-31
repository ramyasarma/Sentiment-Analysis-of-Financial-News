Nawras, the Omani mobile phone
company controlled by  Qatar Telecom QSC , said its initial share
sale was fully subscribed and that it will announce the pricing
of the issue on Oct. 31.  Nawras plans to list shares in early November, Chairman
Sheikh Salim bin Mustahil Al Ma’ashani said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company had extended the offer period by
one week to Oct. 21.  Investors are showing a pricing preference of between 702
baisas and 802 baisas a share, Oman’s market regulator said on
Oct. 12. Nawras set a range of 702 baisas to 902 baisas in the
sale that opened Sept. 15 for a month.  The company that competes with  Oman Telecommunications Co., 
the largest phone operator in the Persian Gulf country, said in
August it was seeking to raise as much as $608 million by
selling a 40 percent stake. It is offering 260 million shares.  Companies in the Gulf Corporation Council region are
joining a surge in emerging-market share sales as stock markets
rebound and companies restructure their debt.  Aluminium Bahrain BSC, the operator of an 850,000-metric-
ton-a-year smelter, plans to raise as much as 204 million dinars
($541 million) from an initial share sale, the company said on
Oct. 17. Axiom Ltd., a unit of a Dubai-based phone retailer,
plans to sell a 35 percent stake in an IPO by the end of the
year.  Nawras reported third-quarter profit of 12.5 million riyals
($32.5 million) compared with 7.7 million rials in the year-
earlier period, the company said on Oct. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
