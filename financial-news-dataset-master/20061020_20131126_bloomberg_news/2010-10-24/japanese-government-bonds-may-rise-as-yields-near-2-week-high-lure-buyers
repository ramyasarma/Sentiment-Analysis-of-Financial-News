Japan’s longer-maturity bonds rose
for a second day as a government report showed export growth
slowed to the least this year, adding to evidence the economic
recovery is losing momentum.  Thirty-year debt led gains as the yen strengthened to a 15-
year high against the dollar and Japanese stocks dropped. The
Bank of Japan, which holds a policy meeting this week, may have
to ease monetary policy further if the Federal Reserve engages
in further quantitative easing to boost growth, adding to the
dollar’s decline.  “Slowdown signs in Asian economies are affecting Japan,”
said  Tatsushi Shikano , a senior economist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s largest
bank. “Yields remain under downward pressure.”  The yield on the 30-year bond fell two basis points to
1.925 percent as of 3:32 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 2 percent
security due in September 2040 rose 0.384 yen to 101.423 yen.  Twenty-year yields dropped 1.5 basis points to 1.745
percent. Ten-year yields climbed half a basis point to 0.895
percent.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery dropped 0.04 to
143.42 at the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.3 percent.  “Investors maintain a strong appetite to buy cash bonds on
dips,”  Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo
Securities Co., wrote today in a note to clients.  Exports Slow  Exports increased 14.4 percent in September from a year
earlier, after growing 15.8 percent the previous month, the
Finance Ministry said today in Tokyo. From a month earlier,
shipments fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent.  The yen rose as high as 80.66 per dollar today, the
strongest since April 1995 when its climbed to a post-World War
II low of 79.75.  All 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg say the central
bank will refrain from any action at its Oct. 28 gathering after
unexpectedly cutting interest rates on Oct. 5 and creating a 5
trillion-yen fund ($61.9 billion) to purchase assets including
corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds and real-estate
investment trusts.  The Ministry of Finance will sell 2.6 trillion yen of two-
year notes on Oct. 27. The previous two-year sale in September
drew bids for 5.75 times the amount on offer, compared with a
so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 4.75 at the August auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
