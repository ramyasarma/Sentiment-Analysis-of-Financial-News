French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
top social affairs aide, who advised him on the pensions system
overhaul and negotiated with labor unions, said he will quit his
job at the end of November.
??Raymond Soubie, who has held the job since Sarkozy came to
power in May 2007, said on  Europe 1 radio  that he will go back
to his own lobbying business and declined to say who will
replace him. Soubie said he may stay on until the start of
December to ensure that all current business is resolved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
