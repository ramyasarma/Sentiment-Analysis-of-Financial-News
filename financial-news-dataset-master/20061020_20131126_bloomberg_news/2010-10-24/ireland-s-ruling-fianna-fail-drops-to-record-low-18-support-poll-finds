Ireland’s ruling Fianna Fail party
has dropped to its lowest level of support ever as it prepares
to unveil a plan next month to reduce the European Union’s
largest budget deficit, the  Sunday Business Post  said  The poll of 1,002 people by Red C, published today, showed
18 percent of respondents support Fianna Fail, a drop of six
percentage points. Support for the main opposition party, Fine
Gael, rose one percentage point to 32, while the Labour Party
increased four percentage points to 27.  Ireland’s bailout of Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and other
lenders may cost as much as 50 billion euros ($70 billion),
pushing the budget deficit to 32 percent of gross domestic
product, the Finance Ministry has said. Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  will next month lay out a plan to reduce the deficit to
3 percent of GDP by 2014, bringing the country within the
European Union limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
