Germany and Malta, the euro region’s
largest and smallest economies, are alone in boosting their
competitiveness and fiscal sustainability in the past five
years, a study showed.  Every other euro country has slipped into worse economic
health, according to a scoreboard of debt, labor, productivity
and trade indicators published today by Allianz SE and the
Lisbon Council, a Brussels research institute.  “Virtually all euro-zone countries still face a massive
task in getting their public finances back in order,”  Michael Heise , Allianz chief economist and principal author of the
study, said in a statement. “There is furthermore a pressing
need for improvement in the fields of structural competitiveness
and productivity.”  Greece, the trigger of the debt shock that rattled the
euro, ranks as the economy most at risk, trailing Portugal,
Spain and Ireland.  Heise said the indicator would have offered an early
warning of Ireland’s fiscal crunch, showing as early as 2008
that the country was plummeting down the euro economy rankings.  European governments plan to set up a similar scoreboard to
monitor economic imbalances to prevent a repeat of the debt
crisis, though they are divided over how to punish poorly
performing countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
