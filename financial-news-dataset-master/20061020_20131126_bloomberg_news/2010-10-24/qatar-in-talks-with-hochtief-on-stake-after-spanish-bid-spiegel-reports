Qatar is in talks with Hochtief AG
about taking a stake in the construction company, which seeks to
thwart a hostile takeover bid by Spain’s Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA,  Spiegel  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Qatar hasn’t made any decision on the potential investment,
the magazine reported.  Hochtief Chief Executive  Herbert Luetkestratkoetter  was
introduced to Qatari officials during a state visit in late
September, and any reports about that brief discussion are
“pure speculation,” Hochtief spokeswoman  Jutta Hobbiebrunken 
said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
