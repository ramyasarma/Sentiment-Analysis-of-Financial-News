Oil gained for a second day as
investors bought contracts against a weakening dollar and
Hurricane Richard headed for the Gulf of Mexico, home to 31
percent of U.S. crude production.  Futures advanced as much as 1 percent as the dollar
depreciated against all but one of its 16 major peers after
Group of 20 leaders pledged not to use exchange rates to boost
exports. Richard strengthened, passing over the Central
American nation of Belize, the U.S.  National Hurricane
Center  said.  “It’s general dollar weakness that’s impacting crude,”
 Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney, said in an interview. “Investors will
also start to build in a bit of a premium as a result of the
hurricane.”  The December contract rose as much as 85 cents to $82.54 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, and was at $82.45 at 12:39 p.m. Singapore time. It
climbed 1.4 percent to $81.69 on Oct. 22. Prices increased 0.5
percent last week and are up 3.9 percent this year.  G-20 officials, who ended talks in South Korea on Oct. 23,
pledged to refrain from “competitive devaluation” and to let
markets set foreign-exchange values. The dollar fell as much as
0.6 percent to $1.4043 per euro, from $1.3954 on Oct. 22.  “What’s really driving up the oil price today is the
dollar,” said Victor Shum , a senior principal at consultants 
Purvin & Gertz Inc. in Singapore. “There are other factors that
are supportive like the ongoing strikes in France. It looks like
France now will have to import fuels.”  Refineries Close  Industrial action across France over plans by President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  to raise the age for retirement and pensions
have caused nine of 11 refineries to shut and the other two to
run at reduced rates, disrupting shipments to foreign markets.
The stoppages, which began at the port of Marseille on Sept. 27,
may have cut gasoline production by about 300,000 barrels a day,
according to Credit Agricole CIB.  One quarter of France’s service stations faced supply
disruptions and fuel shortages will worsen today, according to
union officials.  “We didn’t supply much” yesterday “so the situation will
be more difficult for everyone,”  Jean-Louis Schilansky , head of
the refiners’ group Union Francaise des Industries Petrolieres
told Agence France-Presse yesterday. French imports of fuel rose
to 100,000 tons a day from an average 20,000 to 25,000 tons in
normal days, Schilansky said Oct. 23.  Gulf of Mexico  Hurricane Richard, with maximum sustained winds near 90
miles per hour (145 kilometers per hour) will move over the
central part of Belize and into northern Guatemala early today,
the Miami-based center said in its latest advisory at 11 p.m.
New York time yesterday. Richard may reach the extreme southern
Gulf of Mexico by tonight or early tomorrow.  Brent crude for December settlement added as much as 66
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $83.62 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract gained $1.13, or 1.4
percent, to $82.96 on Oct. 22.  Crude may decline this week, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 30 analysts. Fourteen of 30 respondents, or 47
percent, forecast prices will fall through Oct. 29. Eleven
economists predicted prices will be little changed and five
estimated an increase.  “The G-20 agreement is interpreted by the market as a 
green light for the U.S. to devalue the dollar, Purvin &
Gertz’s Shum said in an interview. ‘‘The inverse relationship
between oil prices and the dollar is likely to continue.’’  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in New York crude-oil futures in the
week ended Oct. 19, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data said last week.  Managed money bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 163,641
futures, the Washington-based regulator said in its weekly
Commitments of Traders report. Net long positions fell by 15,097
contracts, or 8.5 percent, from a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
