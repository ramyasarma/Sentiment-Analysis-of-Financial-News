Bahrain Telecommunications Co., the
nation’s largest phone company, said Gert Rieder resigned as the
chief executive officer for its Bahrain operations.  Peter Kaliaropoulos, the company’s group CEO, will assume
the role while Batelco appoints a new person to the position in
Bahrain, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Rieder joined Batelco Bahrain in April 2009 and resigned due to
personal reasons, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
