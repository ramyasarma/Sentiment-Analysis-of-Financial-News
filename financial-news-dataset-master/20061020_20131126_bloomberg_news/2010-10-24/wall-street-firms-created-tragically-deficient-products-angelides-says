Wall Street firms such as  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.  and  Citigroup Inc.  created products that were
“tragically deficient,” in the view of the chairman of the
panel charged by Congress with identifying the causes of the
financial crisis.  “The notion that Wall Street was non-culpable is just
ridiculous,”  Phil Angelides , the chairman of the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission, said in an  interview  aired yesterday
on C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” show. “Either people knew and didn’t
care, or they didn’t know and they didn’t care to know.”  He cited Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch as
parts of a “Wall Street mortgage-security machine” that, he
said, never slowed even after the housing market peaked in 2005
or 2006.  “They in fact were creating products that they were
selling into the marketplace,” Angelides said. “They clearly
turned out to be tragically deficient products.”  Legislative leaders of both parties appointed the  10-member
commission  in 2009 to investigate the causes of the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression. The panel has until
December to report its findings to Congress.  Angelides, the former treasurer of California and a
Democrat, estimated the commission and its staff have
interviewed 600 to 700 people.  “We’re now putting together the findings of our
investigation, we’re working furiously, we’re deliberating as
commissioners and we hope to have a report delivered to the
American people that helps explain how this calamity came to
be,” Angelides said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
