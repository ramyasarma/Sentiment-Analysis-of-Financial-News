     Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) --Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
said the nation’s security situation is becoming increasingly
challenging, citing China’s naval activity and North Korea’s
nuclear developments.  “The security situation surrounding Japan is becoming more
challenging, as evidenced by concerns over North Korea’s missile
and nuclear arms development and China’s increasing naval
activity as well as its military modernization,” Kan today said
at an inspection parade of troops near Tokyo.  “Therefore, we need to prepare and stand ready to deal
with various situations effectively,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
