BP Plc’s former Chief executive
Officer  John Browne  is leading a group of bidders for $4 billion
of Nigerian oil fields being sold by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc , the
Sunday Times said today.  Browne’s Riverstone Management Ltd. is interested in
bidding, as are KKR & Co. and Blackstone Group LP, the Times
said. Another bid group includes Perenco SA, Addax & Oryx Group
Ltd. and Oando Plc, the newspaper said. Any bidder will have to
have a local partner to meet government requirements, it said.  Partners ENI SpA and Total SA have the right to buy Shell’s
30 percent stake in the fields, and Nigeria’s majority holding
national oil company must approve any deal, the Times said.  Kim Blomley , a spokesman for Shell in London, declined to
comment to Bloomberg News today about the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
