Hungary’s October  economic sentiment 
index rose to the highest since May 2006 as businesses and
consumers became more optimistic, market research institute GKI
said.  The economic sentiment index advanced to minus 9.2 from
minus 11.7 in September, Budapest-based GKI said in an e-mailed
statement. The business confidence index improved to minus 5.2
from minus 7 and the measure for consumer confidence rose to
minus 20.6 from minus 25.  The GKI indexes are calculated based on a balance of
positive and negative answers to questions about the outlook for
the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
