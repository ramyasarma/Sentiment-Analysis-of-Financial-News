Lazio took a four-point lead in
Italian soccer’s Serie A with a 2-1 home win over Cagliari.  Sergio Floccari  and Stefano Mauri scored for Lazio, with
Alessandro Matri replying for the visitors. Lazio has 19 points
and Inter Milan has 15 after a 1-1 home draw against Sampdoria
in yesterday’s late game. AC Milan -- playing at Napoli today --
has 14 points.  In Spain, Real Madrid leads on 20 points after four goals
from  Cristiano Ronaldo  helped it win 6-1 over Racing Santander
two days ago. Barcelona is a point behind after a 2-0 victory at
Real Zaragoza. Villarreal joined Barca on 19 points with a 2-0
win against Atletico Madrid in yesterday’s late game.  In Germany, Mainz returned to the top of the Bundesliga
with a 1-0 win at Bayer Leverkusen yesterday, Andreas Ivanschitz
scoring in the 70th minute.  Borussia Dortmund grabbed a 1-1 draw with Antonia da
Silva’s goal from a free kick in injury time against visitors
Hoffenheim. Mainz has 24 points, two ahead of Dortmund.  Cologne fired coach  Zvonimir Soldo  after a 2-1 loss at
Hanover two days ago. It’s won only one of nine league games
this season.  In the Netherlands, league leader PSV Eindhoven handed
Feyenoord a club-record 10-0 defeat yesterday. Jonathan Reis got
three goals, and Jeremain Lens and Balazs Dzsudzsak each got two
as PSV equaled its record victory.  PSV was already 1-0 up when the visitors were reduced to 10
men after 34 minutes as Kelvin Leerdam was red-carded. PSV leads
the standings by two points from champion FC Twente, which
defeated Den Haag 3-2.  Rennes leads the French standings by a point, even after a
1-0 home defeat by Montpellier two days ago.  In Scotland, an own goal by Glenn Loovens and a double by
 Kenny Miller  gave Rangers a 3-1 win at Celtic after the home
team took the lead through Gary Hooper just before halftime. The
result gives Rangers a three-point advantage over its Glasgow
archrival at the top of the Scottish Premier League.  WEEKEND RESULTS
