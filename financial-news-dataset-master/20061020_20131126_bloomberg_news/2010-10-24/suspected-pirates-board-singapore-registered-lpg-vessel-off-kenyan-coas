A Singapore-registered liquefied
petroleum gas vessel was boarded by suspected pirates about 90
nautical miles from Mombasa, Kenya, the Maritime and Port
Authority of Singapore said in a statement today.  The vessel York, owned by York Maritime Co. Ltd, was on its
way to Mahe, Seychelles from Mombasa when boarded, the port
authority said.  A distress alert from the vessel, which has 17 crew on
board, was received at 8:25 p.m. Singapore time yesterday, it
said. Most of the liquefied petroleum gas carried by the vessel
had been offloaded in Mombasa, Gerald Lim, director at
Singapore-based York, said in a phone interview today.  Company executives involved in the operation and management
of the vessel will be meeting in Greece between 2 p.m. and 3
p.m. Singapore time, Lim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
