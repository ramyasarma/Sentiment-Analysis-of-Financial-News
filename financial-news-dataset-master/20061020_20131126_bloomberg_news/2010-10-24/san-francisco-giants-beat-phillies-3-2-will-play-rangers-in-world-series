The San Francisco Giants beat
Philadelphia 3-2 to advance to the World Series against the
Texas Rangers and end the Phillies’ two-year reign as National
League champions.   Juan Uribe hit a solo home run for San Francisco in the top
of the eighth inning to snap a 2-2 tie at Citizens Bank Park in
Philadelphia.   The Giants won the best-of-seven National League
Championship Series four games to two and claimed their fourth
NL pennant since moving to San Francisco in 1958. The Giants
return to the World Series for the first time since 2002, when
they lost to the Anaheim Angels.   The Phillies, held scoreless after two first-inning runs,
were seeking to become the first NL team to make Major League
Baseball’s World Series three years in a row since the St. Louis
Cardinals from 1942-44.   The World Series starts Oct. 27 in San Francisco.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
