Italy’s Matteo Manassero claimed
golf’s Castello Masters title by four strokes today to become
the youngest winner on the European Tour.  Manassero, who was 164th in the world rankings before the
event near Valencia in Spain, hit a final-round 67 to finish on
16-under-par 268. At age 17 years, 188 days he beats the record
of New Zealand’s Danny Lee, winner of the 2009 Johnnie Walker at
18 years, 213 days.  Manassero, whose previous best performance was third place
at the Omega Masters, will move into the top 100 in the rankings
following the win at his 18th European Tour event.  The former British Amateur Champion finished four shots
ahead of Spain’s  Ignacio Garrido , with overnight leader Gary
Boyd of England, Ireland’s  Peter Lawrie , Joost Luiten of the
Netherlands and Sweden’s Christian Nilsson another shot back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
