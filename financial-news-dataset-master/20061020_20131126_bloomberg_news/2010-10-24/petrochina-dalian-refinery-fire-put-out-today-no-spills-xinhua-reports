A fire at an oil tank at Dalian’s
Xingang Port, partly owned by  PetroChina Co. , was put out at 2
a.m. local time today with no injuries or oil spilled, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing an onsite work team.  The fire started yesterday afternoon when PetroChina
workers were dismantling the oil tank that had caught fire on
July 16 and had leftover oil, Xinhua reported.  Operations at PetroChina’s Dalian refinery were normal and
hadn’t been affected by the accident, said an official at the
plant, declining to be identified because of company rules.
Xingang Port is also operating normally, he said.  PetroChina has set up a team to investigate the accident,
parent China National Petroleum Corp. said in a statement on its
 website  today.  An explosion at oil pipelines at the Xingang port on July
16 caused about 1,500 metric tons of oil to spill into the
Yellow Sea. The accident forced the closure of the oil terminal
at Xingang port and delayed oil deliveries to refineries.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors:  Jane Lee ,  John Chacko .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
