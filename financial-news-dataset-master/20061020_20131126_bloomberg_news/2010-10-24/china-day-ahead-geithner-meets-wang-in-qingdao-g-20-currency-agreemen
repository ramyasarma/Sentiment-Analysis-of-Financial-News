U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and Chinese Vice Premier  Wang Qishan  met for talks
yesterday in China’s coastal city of Qingdao, during which they
discussed economic ties and prepared for a summit of Group of 20
leaders in South Korea next month.  “The two sides exchanged views on U.S.-China economic
relations and the preparation for the leaders’ summit in Seoul,”
the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement a day after a
meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers in
Gyeongju, South Korea.  Geithner was joined at the two-hour lunch meeting by  Lael Brainard , the Treasury’s undersecretary for international
affairs, and  David Dollar , the department’s economic and
financial emissary to China. Geithner departed for Washington
after the meeting.  G-20 on Currency  Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers vowed to
avoid weakening currencies to lift exports, leaving leaders to
flesh out new ways of prodding fellow member China to allow
faster gains in the yuan.  Officials ended talks in South Korea on Oct. 23 pledging to
refrain from “competitive devaluation” and to let markets set
foreign-exchange values more as they sought to calm fears that
they risk a trade war by using cheaper currencies to spur growth.
They called for more sustainable current-account gaps without
embracing a U.S. proposal for targets, an initiative aimed at
making a yuan advance more palatable to China.  The task of finding a broader agreement now falls to next
month’s Seoul summit of leaders as strategists from UBS AG to
Westpac Banking Corp. said the decisions taken in Gyeongju were
unlikely to mark an end to the dollar’s recent slide or trigger
a quicker rise in the yuan. The immediate direction of markets
will likely be driven by next week’s Federal Reserve meeting as
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke  signals it may buy more assets.  WTO Complaints  World Trade Organization  judges rejected eight out of 11
complaints by China against U.S. duties on imports of steel
pipes, some off-road tires and woven sacks.  The U.S. announced levies in July 2008 on $200 million of
steel pipe shipments from China, South Korea and Mexico. Chinese
exporters of the light, rectangular piping face countervailing
duties, used to offset subsidies, of as much as 200 percent of
the product’s price and anti-dumping duties, which compensate
for goods sold overseas at prices below those at home, of as
much as 265 percent.  Judges upheld the right of the U.S. to impose both sets of
tariffs on the Chinese products, the U.S. Trade Representative’s
office said in a statement. It’s the second time the U.S. has
imposed duties on Chinese imports to compensate for subsidies,
after a similar case in June 2008 involving a different type of
steel pipe.  CCB, BOC Issues Approved  China Construction Bank Corp.  and  Bank of China Ltd.  won
final regulatory approval for their plans to raise as much as a
combined 135 billion yuan ($20.3 billion) to replenish capital.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission approved
Construction Bank’s 75 billion yuan rights offer and Bank of
China’s 60 billion yuan sale, according to a statement on the
regulator’s website.  UPS Adds Flights  United Parcel Service Inc.  expects to handle 430 million
packages globally between Thanksgiving and Christmas and has
added flights in China to meet surging export demand, Chief
Executive Officer  Scott Davis  said.  The projected volume for the peak holiday season marks a
7.5 percent increase from a year earlier, when the world’s
largest package-delivery company had one fewer shipping day.
Retailers surveyed by  UPS  anticipate holiday sales rising about
3 percent, Davis said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  “It doesn’t sound great, but last year we were flat, and
the year before that we were minus 4 percent,” Davis said.  China Online Map  China said a new state-sponsored online map will offer the
most comprehensive data about the country’s geography, as the
government seeks to draw users to the service amid competition
from  Google Inc.  and  Sohu.com Inc.   The “Map World” service “surpasses all other available
online map services” in the coverage of China, the State Bureau
of Surveying and Mapping, which oversees the project, said in a
 statement  on its website. The map service also allows users to
view overseas locations, though in less detail, the government
agency said.  Glossy Paper Duties  The U.S. will impose dumping and anti-subsidy duties on
glossy paper from Indonesia and China after the U.S.
International Trade Commission ruled that domestic makers may be
harmed by low-cost imports.  The panel’s 6-0 vote on Oct. 22 is the final step needed to
set tariffs on imports valued at $260 million of the paper,
which is used to print magazines and art books.  NewPage Corp. ,
Appleton Coated LLC and a unit of  Sappi Ltd . sought the duties,
citing China’s and Indonesia’s policies of debt forgiveness,
cheap power and low-cost access to timber for domestic producers.  World Expo  China passed its target of 70 million visitors to the 2010
Shanghai World Expo, reaching the world record figure as the
six-month exhibition enters its final week.  The number was achieved at 10:17 a.m. local time yesterday,
according to the official website of the exhibition that opened
in China’s financial hub on May 1. A total of 64 million people
visited the 1970 Osaka World Expo in Japan, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported.  “The news that total visitors surpassed 70 million is
exciting, and it is also an encouragement and a positive
response,” the Expo organizers said in a statement on the
website.  THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY:  Bank fundraisings:  China Construction Bank Corp.  (601939 CH)
