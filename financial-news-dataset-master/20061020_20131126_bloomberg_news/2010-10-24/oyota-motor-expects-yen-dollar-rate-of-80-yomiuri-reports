Toyota Motor Corp. expects the yen
to trade around 80 during the remainder of this fiscal year, the
Yomiuri newspaper reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.   The automaker, which currently bases its business
projections on the yen trading at 90 against the dollar, will
soon revise the assumed exchange rate, the report said.   The revision would translate into a reduction in earnings
of about 150 billion yen ($1.8 billion) during the period, the
report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
