Fernando Alonso  of Ferrari won the
Korean Grand Prix in Yeongam after Red Bull’s Mark Webber
crashed out of the race and his teammate  Sebastian Vettel 
retired with an engine problem.  Lewis Hamilton  of McLaren and Ferrari’s  Felipe Massa  were
second and third, respectively, in today’s race.  The result means Alonso moves 11 points clear at the top of
the Formula One drivers’ standings, which had been held by
Webber, who is now second.  The inaugural Korean Grand Prix, the third-to-last race of
the season, was delayed after heavy rain lashed the Yeongam
circuit.  With two races remaining, Alonso insisted nothing had
really changed.  “We know with the new points system everything can change
in one race,” he was cited by the British Broadcasting Corp. as
saying. “If you don’t score, you lose 25 points to your
opponents.”  The penultimate race of the season is the Brazilian Grand
Prix on Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
