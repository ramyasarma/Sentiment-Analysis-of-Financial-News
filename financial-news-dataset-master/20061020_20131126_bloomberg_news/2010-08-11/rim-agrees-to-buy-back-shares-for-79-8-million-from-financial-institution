             Research In Motion Ltd. , maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone, agreed to repurchase 1.53 million of
its shares, for a total of about $79.8 million.  
 The shares represent about 0.28 percent of common shares
outstanding as of June 24, RIM said today in a statement. The
company is buying the stock from an unnamed third-party
financial institution, according to the statement.  
 RIM has lost a quarter of its value since the end of March.
While  sales  have increased, the company has lost share in the
smartphone software market.  Google Inc. ’s Android operating
system grabbed the No. 1 spot in the second quarter, pushing RIM
to second place in the U.S. market, according to NPD Group Inc.
As phones that run on Android make further inroads, RIM may slip
further, said Chetan Sharma, an independent analyst.  
 “They have a fight on their hands even for a No. 3 spot,”
Sharma said. The  buyback  is likely intended to assure investors
that the company will stop the slide and remain a long-term
major player in smartphones, he said.  
 RIM  rose  1.1 percent to $55.93 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading today. The shares have  dropped  17 percent this year.  
 At its June 24 earnings call, RIM said it repurchased 18.2
million shares, at a cost of 1.2 billion, since November. On
June 24, the company authorized a repurchase of an additional 31
million shares in the next 12 months.  
 New Products Announced  
 The buyback comes on the heels of several product
announcements. Yesterday, RIM introduced the BlackBerry Curve 3G,
which surfs the Web faster than its predecessors. Last week, it
unveiled the BlackBerry Torch, which will be available through
AT&T Inc. on Aug. 12 and feature BlackBerry 6, its new operating
system. The software features redesigned menus and better
messaging and social-networking capabilities.  
 RIM has also faced increasing challenges to its expansion
as some developing countries tighten restrictions on mobile e-
mail. Saudi Arabia this week allowed the company to continue its
service while asking RIM to create a system that lets it monitor
user data. United Arab Emirates and India have expressed concern
that mobile communications could be used to violate laws.  
 The company plans to introduce a tablet computer in
November to compete with Apple Inc.’s iPad, two people familiar
with RIM’s plans said last month.
