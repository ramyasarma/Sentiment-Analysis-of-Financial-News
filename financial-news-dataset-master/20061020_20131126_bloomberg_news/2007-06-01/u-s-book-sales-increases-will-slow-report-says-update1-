             U.S. book sales will increase less
than 4 percent annually during each of the next five years as
the publishing industry competes with the Internet and other
media, a study found.  
 Sales climbed 3.1 percent to $35.7 billion in 2006,
according to the Book Industry Study Group Inc. Titles sold rose
0.5 percent to 3.1 billion, the New York-based trade group said
in the 2007 edition of Book Industry Trends, released today.  
 Publishers increasingly vie for readers with the Internet,
cable television and other media. U.S. book sales will be buoyed
this year by  Scholastic Corp. (SCHL) 's ``Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows,'' the seventh and final book of the series, which comes
out July 21. The novels have sold more than 325 million copies
worldwide and made author J.K. Rowling a billionaire.  
 ``Book sales are slowing down, although not dramatically,''
said  Edward Atorino , a media analyst with Benchmark Co. in New
York. ``Part of the slowdown will be from the lack of `Harry
Potter' and competition from electronic communications.''  
 Book sales at publishers including Bertelsmann AG's Random
House Inc., are forecast to climb 3.9 percent to $37.1 billion
in 2007, the report said. The annual sales gain is projected to
decline almost each year through 2011, when publishers may
report a 2.7 percent increase in revenue.  
 Juvenile trade hardcover sales probably will jump 9 percent
in 2007 to $1.83 billion, then dip 0.4 percent in 2008.  
 School Books  
 Workbooks and textbooks for elementary and high school
students may post some of the biggest sales gains, climbing
about 7 percent annually for the next three years. Sales of such
books climbed 1 percent to $4.75 billion in 2006.  
 Educational sales may increase because more states plan to
buy new textbooks in reading, math and other subjects through
2009, said Atorino.  
 The BISG study was compiled using financial data from
publicly traded companies, analyst reports, industry group
information, statistical data, government reports and book
industry experts.  
 A May 22 report by the Association of American Publishers
found sales fell 0.3 percent to $24.2 billion in 2006. The group
uses Census data and sales figures from 81 publishers to compile
its estimates.
