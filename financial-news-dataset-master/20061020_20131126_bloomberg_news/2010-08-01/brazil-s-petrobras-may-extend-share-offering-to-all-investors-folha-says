             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, may extend its planned share
offering to all investors, Folha de S. Paulo reported, without
saying where it got the information.  
 Existing shareholders may see their stakes diluted in
Petrobras, as the company is known, if the new plan is adopted,
the newspaper said.  
 The banks hired by Petrobras to carry the offering are
proposing to let all Brazilian workers tap an employment-linked
savings fund known as FGTS to buy the company’s new shares,
Folha said. The proposal may have to be voted on by the
Brazilian Congress, the newspaper said.  
 Petrobras declined to comment, citing the so-called quiet
period before the offering, spokeswoman Mirian Guaraciada said
in a telephone interview today.
