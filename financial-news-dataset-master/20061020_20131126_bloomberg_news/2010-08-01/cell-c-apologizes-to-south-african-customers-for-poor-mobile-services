             Cell C (Pty) Ltd., South Africa’s
third-largest mobile phone-operator, apologized to customers for
poor service and said it was taking steps to fix the problem.  
 “Criticism about spotty coverage, dropped calls and
overall lack of delivery is not unfounded,” Cell C Chief
Executive Officer  Lars Reichelt  said in a full-page
advertisement published in Johannesburg’s Sunday Times newspaper
today. “We know how frustrated South Africans are with the
cellular industry, which is why we are so very serious about
turning things around.”  
 The closely held company, which is based in Johannesburg,
was responding to complaints aired on social-networking website
Facebook Inc. Cell C is building a faster network and new
customer-care and billing systems, and had made major changes to
its sales and logistics operations, Reichelt said.  
 MTN Group Ltd.  and Vodacom Group Ltd. are South Africa’s
biggest mobile-phone operators.
