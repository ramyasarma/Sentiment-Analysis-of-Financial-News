             Malawi’s central bank cut the key
interest rate to 13 percent from 15 percent, the first reduction
in almost three years, as inflation slows.  
 “The decision to reduce the bank rate was made in light of
good progress made in reducing inflation,” Governor  Perks Ligoya  said in a statement from the Reserve Bank of Malawi aired
today on state-run Malawi Broadcasting Corporation.  
 The rate was last reduced in November 2007, from 17.5
percent to 15 percent. Inflation slowed to 7.5 percent in June
from 7.8 percent in May on low food prices, the National
Statistics Office said on July 20.  
 A shortage of foreign exchange in the southern African
nation had curbed the bank’s ability to cut the rate,
the Reserve Bank of Malawi’s monetary policy committee said in
minutes of its meeting held on May 6.  
 Central bank spokeman  Samuel Malitoni  told the Sunday Times
today that the reduction aims to promote private-sector growth.
Bankers Association of Malawi President John Biswick told the
Blantyre-based newspaper that banks will reduce the base lending
rate following the central bank’s move. Bank’s currently charge
an average of 22 percent.
