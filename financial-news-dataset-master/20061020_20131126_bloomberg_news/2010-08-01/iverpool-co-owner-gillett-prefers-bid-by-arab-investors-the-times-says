             Liverpool’s co-owner is in talks with
Yahya Kirdi, a Syrian who heads a group of Arab investors which
has emerged as a contender for the soccer club valued at about
400 million pounds ($628 million), the Sunday Times reported,
without citing anyone.  
 The group is the most favored bidder of Liverpool’s co-
owner George Gillett, who introduced Kirdi to senior officials
of the club and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the newspaper
reported.
