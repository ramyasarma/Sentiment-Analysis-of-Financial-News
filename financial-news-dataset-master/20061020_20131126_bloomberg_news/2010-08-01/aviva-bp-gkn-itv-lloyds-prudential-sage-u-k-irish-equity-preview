             U.K. stocks surged to the highest
level in two and a half months as HSBC Holdings Plc reported
profit that beat analysts’ estimates and basic-resources
companies tracked metals prices higher.  
 HSBC led a rally in bank shares after posting pretax profit
of $11.1 billion. BHP Billiton Ltd. rose 4.3 percent as copper
climbed to a three-month high.  Intertek Group Plc ,  Tullett
Prebon Plc  and Senior Plc rose more than 5 percent after
reporting higher sales.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  climbed 139.09, or 2.7
percent, to 5,397.11 as of the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in
London, the highest level since May 13. The gauge has surged 12
percent from this year’s low July 1 as concern eased that
efforts by European governments to curb their budget deficits
may derail the economic recovery. The  FTSE All-Share Index  rose
2.5 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  advanced 1.4 percent today.  
 “We are positive on equities,”  Mislav Matejka , the
London-based head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Chase
& Co., wrote in a report today. “Earnings remain a support.
Most of the leading indicators we follow suggest further growth
ahead.”  
 Stocks extended gains to the highest levels of the day
after separate reports showed manufacturing and construction
spending in the U.S. exceeded economists’ estimates. Other
figures today showed European manufacturing expanded in July by
the most in three months.  
 HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, surged 5.3 percent to 680
pence as pretax profit of $11.1 billion topped analysts’
estimates. Lloyds banking Group Plc, the U.K.’s largest mortgage
lender, jumped 4.6 percent to 72.44 pence.  Barclays Plc  rallied
3.4 percent to 343.95 pence.  
 Loan Provisions  
 Bank stocks were among the biggest gainers in Europe.  BNP
Paribas SA , France’s biggest bank, said second-quarter profit
rose 31 percent as bad-loan provisions dropped to the lowest
level since before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008
bankruptcy.  
 BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, rose 4.3
percent to 2,034.5 pence. Rio Tinto Group, the third-biggest,
gained 4.4 percent to 3,450 pence. Lead, nickel, tin and zinc
also rose on the London Metal Exchange.  
 Intertek  rallied 6.2 percent to 1,674 pence. The
inspection-services company said first-half revenue rose to
652.6 million pounds ($1.03 billion).  
 Senior advanced 5.1 percent to 134 pence. First-half net
income rose 43 percent to 22.3 million pounds, from 15.6 million
pounds a year earlier. Revenue climbed to 287.7 million pounds.  
 Tullett Prebon  surged 5.6 percent to 359.5 pence after
reporting first-half revenue of 475.8 million pounds. This beat
broker Panmure Gordon & Co.’s estimate and the consensus
estimate, analyst  Vivek Raja  wrote in a report to clients today.
The broker maintained its “buy” recommendation on the shares.  
 Hammerson  Plc increased 2.7 percent to 398.7 pence. The
U.K.’s third-largest real estate investment trust reported a
first-half profit after the value of its properties grew.  
 Xchanging Plc slumped 13 percent to 175 pence, for the
biggest decline on the FTSE 250 Index, after the provider of
back-office services whose clients include Lloyd’s of London
said it will miss an earlier forecast for full-year revenue
growth.
