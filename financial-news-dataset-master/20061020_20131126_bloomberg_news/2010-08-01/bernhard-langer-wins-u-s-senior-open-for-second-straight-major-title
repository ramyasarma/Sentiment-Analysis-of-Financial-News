             Bernhard Langer beat Fred Couples by
three strokes to win the U.S. Senior Open, his second straight
major tournament victory on the Champions Tour.  
 Langer shot a 3-under-par 67 during the final round at
Sahalee Country Club in Seattle and finished 8-under overall.  
 Langer, 52, won the Senior British Open last week and is the
first player to capture back-to-back majors on the 50-and-over
Champions Tour since Tom Watson in 2003.
