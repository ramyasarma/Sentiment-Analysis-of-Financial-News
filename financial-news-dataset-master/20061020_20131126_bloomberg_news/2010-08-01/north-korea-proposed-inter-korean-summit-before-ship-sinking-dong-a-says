             North Korea had proposed to South
Korea to hold a summit between their leaders in December, three
months before the sinking of a South Korean warship, the Dong-A
Ilbo reported, citing a ruling party official in South Korea it
didn’t identify.   
 South Korea’s presidential office didn’t respond to the
North Korean proposal, which also included demand for fertilizer
aid, the Korean-language newspaper said.
