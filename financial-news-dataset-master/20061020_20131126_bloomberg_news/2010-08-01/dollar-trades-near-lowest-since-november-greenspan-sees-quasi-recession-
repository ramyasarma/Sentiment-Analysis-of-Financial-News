             The dollar traded near its weakest
since November against the yen on signs the U.S. recovery is
losing momentum and after Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the slowdown feels like a “quasi recession.”  
 The  Dollar Index  was close to a three-month low before a
report today that may show U.S. manufacturing growth slowed in
July, adding to evidence the Fed will keep interest rates near
zero. Australia’s dollar rose against 15 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as reports yesterday showed China’s manufacturing
expanded for a 17th month and South Korea’s exports increased
for a ninth month, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 “The U.S. economy is certainly losing some steam,” said
 Mike Jones , a currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in
Wellington. “We are seeing bond yields slide, dragging the U.S.
dollar lower in tandem.”  
 The dollar traded at 86.49 yen at 9:07 a.m. in Tokyo from
86.47 yen in New York on July 30, when it reached 85.95 yen, the
lowest level since Nov. 30. The U.S. currency was at $1.3056 per
euro from $1.3052. Australia’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to 90.77
U.S. cents. The yen bought 112.92 per euro from 112.84 last week,
when it touched 112.03, the strongest since July 23.  
 The yen fell against 15 of its 16 most-traded counterparts
after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said in Tokyo
excessive currency movements are bad for the economy and he’s
closely watching financial markets.  
 Dollar Index  
 The U.S. economy might contract again if home prices
decline, Greenspan said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the
Press” yesterday. “We’re in a pause in a recovery, a modest
recovery, but a pause in the modest recovery feels like a quasi-
recession,” he said.  
 Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will speak today on
“Challenges for the Economy and State Governments” in
Charleston, South Carolina.  
 The Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the euro
and the yen, was at 81.54 from 81.539 on July 30, when it
touched 81.459, the lowest level since April 27.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index
for the U.S. will show factories expanded in July at a slower
pace for a third-straight month, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before today’s report.  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
second quarter after a revised 3.7 percent increase in the first
three months of the year, the Commerce Department said July 30.
The forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a 2.6 percent gain.  
 The dollar fell against all of its major counterparts in
July, dropping 2.2 percent against the yen. It slid 6.2 percent
versus the euro.
