             Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd. may have
attracted a new bidder for its A$600 million generics business,
with U.S.-based Watson Pharmaceuticals considering an offer for
the division, the Sydney Morning Herald said. While Watson
hasn’t made a formal offer, it has looked at the business, the
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.
