             Bridgepoint Capital Ltd., a U.K.
buyout firm, is in exclusive talks to acquire and merge 
French jewelers Histoire d’Or and Marc Orian.  
 Bridgepoint may purchase the two jewelry chains for a total
600 million euros ($783 million), according to a person familiar
with the transaction, who declined to be identified because the
discussions are private.  
 “The transaction will allow the new group to become the
European leader” in jewelry retail, according to a statement
from Silverfleet Capital Ltd., owner of Histoire d’Or. A
spokesman for Bridgepoint declined to comment.  
 Buyout firms announced $75.6 billion of takeovers this
year, more than double that in the same period of 2009, as they
started doing deals again following the global financial crisis,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bridgepoint bought
HobbyCraft Group Ltd. for an undisclosed amount in April and
Care U.K. Plc for 281 million pounds ($441 million) in March.  
 Bridgepoint’s potential acquisition of the French jewelers
was reported earlier today by the Sunday Times.  
 The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and won’t
be completed before the final quarter, according to
Silverfleet’s statement.
