             Japanese and Australian  stock   futures 
were little changed as some companies reported improving
earnings, while U.S. economic data failed to reassure investors
about the strength of the global economic recovery.  
 American depositary receipts of  Hitachi Ltd. , Japan’s
third-biggest company by sales, rose 2.6 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo and those of  Honda Motor Co. , the
nation’s second-largest automaker, increased 1.3 percent after
the companies raised profit forecasts. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index closed little changed in New York on July 30 after reports
showed higher-than-estimated consumer confidence and business
activity, and slower-than-estimated economic growth.  
 “The market will probably lack direction,” said  Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“Investors need to get a firm grip on when U.S. economy will
settle from its fall.”  
 Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September closed at 9,535 in Chicago on July 30,
compared with 9,530 in Osaka, Japan. They were  bid  in the pre-
market at 9,540 as of 8:05 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225 closed
at 9,537.30 on July 30.  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  were little
changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed in
Wellington.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 5.6 percent last month,
its first monthly increase since April and the biggest gain
since March, as company earnings reports boosted confidence in
the strength of the global economy. Companies in the index trade
at 14.2 times estimated earnings, compared with 13.3 times for
those in the S&P 500.  
 Commodities, S&P 500  
 The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals gained 1.7
percent on July 30, while copper futures for September delivery
rose 0.7 percent on signs U.S. manufacturing will boost growth
and metals consumption. Crude oil for September delivery climbed
0.8 percent on July 30.  
 In New York, the  S&P 500  was little changed on July 30.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment showed a decline to 67.8 in July, compared
with the 67 forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Separately, the
Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its business
barometer rose to 62.3 in July, more than the median forecast of
economists surveyed.  
 U.S. stocks fell early in the day on July 30 after a report
showed economic growth slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in
the second quarter, less than the 2.6 percent median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey of economists, reflecting a larger trade
deficit and cooler consumer spending.  
 AWB Ltd. , Australia’s largest wheat exporter, had its
investment rating cut to “neutral” from “overweight” at
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 The finance director of  Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd. , a
unit of Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd., said the
company is seeking to acquire additional overseas assets.
