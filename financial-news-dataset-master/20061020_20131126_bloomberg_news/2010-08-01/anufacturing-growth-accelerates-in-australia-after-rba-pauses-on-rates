             Australian  manufacturing  growth
accelerated in July, a sign the central bank’s decision to halt
a world-leading round of interest-rate increases is stoking
consumer spending and business investment.  
 The performance of  manufacturing index  rose 1.5 points to
54.4, the Australian Industry Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers
said in a survey released in Canberra today. A figure above 50
shows the industry is expanding.  
 The seventh straight month of expansion in manufacturing
supports the central bank’s view that the nation’s economy is
strengthening, even after policy makers increased the benchmark
rate six times between October and May. Governor  Glenn Stevens 
will keep borrowing costs unchanged tomorrow for a third month,
according to all 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “The recovery in manufacturing continued in July despite
the waning impacts of fiscal stimulus and above-normal business
interest rates,” said  Heather Ridout , chief executive officer
of the Australian Industry Group. “Private sector demand is
slowly re-emerging as a source of growth.”  
 The manufacturing survey, which is similar to the U.S. ISM
index, asked more than 200 companies about production, new
orders, deliveries, inventories and employment.  
 A gauge of new orders jumped 5.5 points to 56.7, today’s
report showed, and a sub-index of production gained 3.8 points
to 57.3. Employment dropped 5.3 points.
