             Egypt agreed to export 784 metric
tons of cotton in the week through July 29, the Alexandria
Cotton Exporters Association said in its weekly bulletin today.  
 The country has shipped 79,268.5 tons of cotton valued at
$190.6 million since the marketing year began on Sept 1. Of last
week’s sales, Egypt will ship 659 tons of Giza 88 variety of
cotton, and 125 tons of Giza 86, the association said.  
 Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton and is
used in high-end clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and India are
the largest importers of Egyptian cotton.
