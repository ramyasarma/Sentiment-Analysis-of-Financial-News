             The sale of people’s private data by
Octopus Holdings Ltd. has prompted a government review that
could criminalize unauthorized use of personal information, the
South China Morning Post reported today, citing Stephen Lam, the
city’s secretary for constitutional affairs. Octopus chief
executive Prudence Chan said last week the electronic payments
provider had made HK$44 million in revenue selling information
on 1.97 million customers to six companies.
