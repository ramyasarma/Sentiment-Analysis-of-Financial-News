             Citadel Capital Corp. , an Egyptian
private-equity firm with $8.3 billion in investments, said one
of its companies received a $4.9 million loan from Bank of
Khartoum for the plantation of land in Sudan.  
 Sabena Solutions Ltd., in which Cairo-based Citadel Capital
has a 21 percent stake, borrowed the money to plant 2,000 feddan
(2,076 acres) of land with sorghum, according to a regulatory
filing today.  
 Sudan wants to attract foreign investors to cultivate large
tracts of land that are currently unused in Africa’s largest
country. Arab countries such as Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
have started to invest in Sudanese farmland as their own
agricultural industries fail to keep pace with their rising
populations.  
 The Shariah-compliant Islamic banking loan includes a six-
year so-called musharaka loan to finance repairs and
maintenance, a $3.2 million murabaha loan to finance working
capital for seeds, fertilizers and chemicals, and a $1.2 million
five-year mukawala loan for consulting contracts and some
infrastructure work, the statement said.  
 Sabina will cultivate a total of 125,000 feddan in Sudan,
Citadel said. The company has leased about 250,000 feddan that
can be renewed on a 30-year basis, it said.  
 Shares of Citadel Capital gained 1.5 percent as of 2:11
p.m. in Cairo, valuing the company at 4.49 billion Egyptian
pounds ($790 million).
