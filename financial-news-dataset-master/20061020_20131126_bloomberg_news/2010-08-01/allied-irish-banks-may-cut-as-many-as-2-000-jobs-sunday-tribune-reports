             Allied Irish Banks Plc may cut as
many as 2,000 jobs later this year, the Sunday Tribune said,
without citing anyone.  
 The bank, based in Dublin, won’t detail any job cuts until
after the European Commission approves its restructuring plan
and it sells assets, the newspaper said. The company employed
24,681 people at the end of last year. The bank declined to
comment on the report, the newspaper said.
