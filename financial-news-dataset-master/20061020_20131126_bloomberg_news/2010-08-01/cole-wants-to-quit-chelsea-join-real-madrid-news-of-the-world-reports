             England fullback Ashley Cole wants to
quit Chelsea and join former Blues coach Jose Mourinho at Real
Madrid, the News of the World reported, citing a source it

 The 29-year-old told current Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti
in a 20 minute conversation that he feels he needs to leave, the
newspaper said, adding that Cole has not formally requested a
transfer.  
 Madrid will now make a 25 million-pound ($39.2 million) bid
