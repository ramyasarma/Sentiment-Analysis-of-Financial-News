             Stuart Appleby became the fifth
player to shoot a score of 59 in a U.S. PGA Tour event, with an
11-under par round at the Greenbrier Classic.   
 Appleby’s final-round feat comes less than a month after
Paul Goydos shot 59 at the John Deere Classic. David Duval, Chip
Beck and Al Geiberger are the only other players to shoot 59 in
a PGA Tour event.
