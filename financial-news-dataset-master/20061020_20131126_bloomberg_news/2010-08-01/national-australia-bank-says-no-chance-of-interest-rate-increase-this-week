             National Australia Bank Ltd.’s Chief
Economist Alan Oster said there is no chance of the Reserve Bank
of Australia raising interest rates this week.  
 Rates may rise half a percent towards the end of the year
and a further half a percent by the middle of next year, Oster
said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s Inside
Business program.
