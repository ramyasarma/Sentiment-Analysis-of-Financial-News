             Egypt’s  benchmark stock index rose 
for an eighth day, leading an advance in Middle Eastern markets,
as accelerating economic growth and gains in global markets
boosted investor sentiment. Abu Dhabi shares declined.  
 Orascom Telecom Holding SAE  of Egypt, the Middle East’s
biggest mobile telephone company by subscribers, climbed to the
highest in a month. Egypt’s EGX30 Index gained 0.9 percent to
6,371.14 at 1:17 p.m. in Cairo, the highest since June 22. The
measure has gained 7.7 percent in the past eight days, matching
the longest winning streak since April 2008.  Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank PJSC  declined after posting a loss, helping push
Abu Dhabi stocks lower.  
 “Surely economic performance is giving investors more
confidence in the market,” said Cairo-based  Alia Khalil , senior
equity trader at Naeem Brokerage. “However, you have to keep in
mind that EGX30 has been carefully  shadowing  its peers overseas
in terms of performance.”  
 Asian stocks rose for the fourth consecutive week, the
longest winning streak in four months, as company earnings
reports boosted confidence in the strength of the global
economy. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  rose 1 percent last
week.  
 Egyptian economic growth accelerated to 5.9 percent in the
second quarter, boosted by construction and telecommunications,
Economic Development Minister Osman Mohamed Osman said July 28.
The economy expanded 5.8 percent in the first quarter of the
year, Osman said in May. The central bank on July 29 held its
benchmark interest rate at a four-year low for the seventh
straight meeting.  
 Saudi Advances  
 Orascom Telecom  gained 1.4 percent to 5.23 Egyptian pounds,
the highest since June 28. Ezz Steel, Egypt’s biggest publicly
traded steelmaker, advanced for an eighth day, rising 0.7
percent to 18.20 pounds. Al Mal newspaper said the company
raised its ex-factory steel price in August by 1.4 percent to
3,600 Egyptian pounds ($633) per ton.  
 Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  gained 0.5 percent,
Oman’s measure increased 0.6 percent and the  Kuwait Stock
Exchange Index  rose less than 0.1 percent.  
 Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  fell for a third day,
dropping 0.4 percent, as ADCB PJSC, the United Arab Emirates’
third-biggest bank by assets, and Aldar Properties PJSC had
second-quarter losses. Dubai’s DFM General Index lost 0.1
percent.  
 ADCB retreated 1.2 percent to 1.65 dirhams, the lowest
since July 13. The bank posted a  loss of 531 million dirhams 
($145 million) in the second quarter.  
 Yields Drop  
 Aldar, the emirate’s biggest property developer, retreated
1.6 percent to 2.42 dirhams, the lowest since March 2009. The
company’s quarterly loss was 475.3 million dirhams, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on first-half data provided by the
company.  
 The developer’s long-term issuer credit rating was lowered
six levels to BB-, the third-highest junk ranking, from A- by
Standard & Poor’s, citing declining profits and real estate
prices.  
 In Israel, the yield on the 10-year Mimshal Shiklit
maturing in January 2020, declined two basis points to 4.45
percent, the lowest on record, on concern global economic growth
will slow. The U.S. economy slowed in the second quarter as a
scarcity of jobs eroded consumer spending, leaving the rebound
dependent on a surge in business investment, according to a July
30 report.  
 Israel’s  TA-25 Index  rose less than 0.1 percent to
1,118.67.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  gained for the
first time in three days, rising 1.9 percent to 187.10 shekels.
The world’s largest maker of generic drugs said the Competition
Bureau in Canada agreed not to challenge the proposed merger
with Ratiopharm.  Teva  declined 6.5 percent in the previous two
days.  
 Qatar’s  QE Index  lost 0.4 percent, Bahrain’s benchmark and
the Bloomberg GCC 200 Index of the biggest companies in the
Persian Gulf, retreated less than 0.1 percent.
