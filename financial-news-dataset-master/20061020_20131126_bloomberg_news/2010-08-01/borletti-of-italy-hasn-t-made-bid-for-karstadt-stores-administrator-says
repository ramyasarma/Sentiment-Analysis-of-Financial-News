             A document sent by Italian
entrepreneur  Maurizio Borletti  regarding Germany’s Karstadt
doesn’t constitute an offer for the department-store chain,
according to its insolvency administrator.  
 Borletti contacted administrator  Klaus Hubert Goerg , though
his approach poses “more questions than it can answer,”
Cologne-based spokesman Thomas Schulz said today by phone. “To
our knowledge, he hasn’t done the due diligence. Offers look
different,” Schulz said.  
 Representatives for Borletti didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment outside normal working hours.  
 Berggruen Holdings Ltd. signed a contract to acquire
Karstadt on June 8, meaning subsequent expressions of interest
can’t be considered offers, according to Schulz. Bild am Sonntag
reported that Borletti made a 100 million-euro ($131 million)
bid for Karstadt on July 30 in case Berggruen’s takeover fails.  
 While the 100 million-euro figure does feature in a
document Borletti submitted to the insolvency administrator, it
isn’t clear how a bid would be structured, Schulz said. Bild am
Sonntag said the source of its story was an interview with the
businessman.  
 Borletti holds a stake in the Highstreet, Karstadt’s main
landlord. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.-controlled partnership
isn’t involved in Borletti’s offer, a spokeswoman wrote in an e-
mail, asking not to be identified.  
 As long as Karstadt’s insolvency administrator doesn’t
consider the offer, Highstreet won’t examine it either, the
spokeswoman said.
