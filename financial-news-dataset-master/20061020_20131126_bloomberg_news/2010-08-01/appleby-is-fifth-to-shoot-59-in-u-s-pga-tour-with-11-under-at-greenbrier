             Stuart Appleby  became the first non-
U.S. golfer to match the PGA Tour’s record of 59 in winning the
inaugural Greenbrier Classic.  
 The 39-year-old Australian had nine birdies and an eagle
yesterday during his 11-under par round at the Greenbrier’s Old
White Course in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, to beat
 Jeff Overton  by one stroke.  
 Appleby made an 11-foot putt on the 18th hole to become the
second player in 25 days and fifth overall to shoot 59 on the
PGA Tour, joining  Paul Goydos ,  David Duval ,  Chip Beck  and  Al Geiberger . Duval is the only other player to fire 59 in the
final round.  
 “It is great to do that to win a tournament,” Appleby
said during a news conference. “To do that and cap off a low
number was very unique. So a flood of emotions certainly came
across me minutes later.”  
 The 159th-ranked Appleby finished 22-under par for the
tournament and held on for his ninth PGA Tour victory as Overton,
seeking his first title, missed birdie putts on the final two
holes.  
 Appleby’s victory was his first since the 2006 Shell
Houston Open and he receives $1.08 million for the win.  
 His 59 makes him the first PGA Tour player to achieve the
feat on a par-70 course with two par-5 holes. Goydos did it July
8 on the par-71 TPC Deere Run Course in Silvis, Illinois.  
 Geiberger, Beck and Duval made their 59s on par-72 courses.
Geiberger was the first at the 1977 Memphis Classic, while Beck
did it at the 1991 Las Vegas International and Duval reached the
mark at the 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.  
 Birdie Run  
 Appleby closed his round yesterday with three straight
birdies, including his final putt at the par-3 18th hole that
curled into the middle of the cup.  
 “I knew I had to make in for the tournament, I knew I had
to make it to have a 59,” said Appleby. “But I still felt very
relaxed. The cards had been laying out perfectly for me all day
long. Why wasn’t it going to do one more?”  
 Annika Sorenstam  of Sweden is the only woman to shoot 59,
during the second round of an LPGA Tour event in 2001.  
 The lowest score on any of the top professional golf tours
was a 58 by 18-year-old  Ryo Ishikawa  on the Japan Tour in May,
while his fellow Japanese  Shigeki Maruyama  shot 58 at a U.S.
Open qualifying event in 2000.
