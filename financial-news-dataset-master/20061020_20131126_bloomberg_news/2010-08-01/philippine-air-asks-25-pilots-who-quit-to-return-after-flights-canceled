             Philippine Airlines Inc., controlled
by billionaire Lucio Tan, asked pilots who quit without notice
to return to work within seven days, after it was forced to
cancel eight more flights today. Thirteen captains and 12 first
officers crewing Airbus SAS A-319 and A-320 aircraft resigned
without giving Philippine Air enough time to train replacements,
the airline said in a statement today.
