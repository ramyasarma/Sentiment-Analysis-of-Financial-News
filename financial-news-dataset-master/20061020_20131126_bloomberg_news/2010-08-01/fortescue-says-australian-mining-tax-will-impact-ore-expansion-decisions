             Fortescue Metals Group Ltd . said the
Australian government’s proposed mining levy threatens to stop
its A$17 billion ($15 billion) expansion in Western Australia as
an industry body resumes an anti-tax advertising campaign.  
 “It could potentially derail a massive investment into the
economy,” Fortescue Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Forrest  said
in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s Inside
Business program today. “It will have a very, very severe
impact on that decision,” to expand output to 95 million tons a
year from 55 million tons a year.  
 Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  scaled back a proposed 40
percent tax on mining “super profits” to a 30 percent levy on
iron ore and coal profits after ousting  Kevin Rudd  in June.  
 Fortescue, the nation’s third-biggest producer of iron ore,
said last month it may seek financing for the $9 billion Solomon
project once there is more clarity on how the compromise
minerals tax will be implemented. It put the Solomon project and
the $6 billion Western Hub projects on hold when the original
tax was announced in May.  
 “All we know is that there are fundamental issues which
are still in secret, we can’t get answers for and therefore we
can’t really model it,” Forrest said.  
 Smaller Australian mining companies will restart an
advertising campaign against the government’s compromise mine
tax, the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies Inc.
said last week. Gillard negotiated the compromise deal with BHP
Billiton Ltd., Rio Tinto Group and Xstrata Plc.  
 The tax will cost jobs and deter investment and should be
withdrawn to allow consultation with the industry, said the
association, which represents small and mid-size  mining
companies  including Fortescue.  
 The association will resume the campaign tomorrow with
television and radio advertisements saying the tax will increase
the cost of electricity and reduce the value of superannuation
funds, the Australian Associated Press reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Simon Bennison. He wasn’t immediately
available to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.
