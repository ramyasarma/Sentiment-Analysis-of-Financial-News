             Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard failed to consult cabinet about her decision to hold a
citizens’ assembly on climate change if she wins the Aug. 21
federal election, the Australian Financial Review reported,
without saying where it got the information. Many ministers
first heard about the assembly, which has been partly blamed for
a drop in her popularity, when Gillard announced it 10 days ago,
the newspaper said.
