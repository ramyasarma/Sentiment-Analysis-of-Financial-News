             Dana Petroleum Plc ’s board agreed to
shareholders’ demands to meet with  Korea National Oil Corp.  next
week to begin talks about a 1.7 billion-pound ($2.7 billion)
takeover, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing people with
knowledge of the matter that it didn’t identify.  
 This follows a stand-off by Dana’s management after KNOC’s
proposal 10 days ago for a cash takeover at 18 pounds a share,
according to the report.
