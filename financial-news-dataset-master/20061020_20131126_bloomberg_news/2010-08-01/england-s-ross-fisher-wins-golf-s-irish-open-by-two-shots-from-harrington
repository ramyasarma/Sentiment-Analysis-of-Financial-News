             England’s  Ross Fisher  shot a final-
round 65 to win golf’s Irish Open by two shots from local
favorite  Padraig Harrington  and collect a first European Tour
title this year.  
 Fisher, who  finished on 18-under-par  266 at the Killarney
Golf & Fishing Club, has now collected a title in each of the
past four years. His last success came at November’s Volvo World
Match Play Championship.  
 The 29-year-old receives a check for 500,000 euros
($653,000) and improves his chances of securing a spot in
Europe’s Ryder Cup team to face the U.S. at Celtic Manor in
Wales in two months.  
 “It just feels great to come out on top against such a
world-class field,” Fisher, who matched Colin Montgomerie’s
course record over four rounds, told reporters. “I could hear
the roars and knew Padraig was making a charge.”  
 Two-time British Open champion Harrington came into
contention with a 64 today, to finish 16-under. England’s Chris
Wood and  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano  of Spain were 14-under, with
Richard Bland of England and Australia’s Richard Green another
shot back.
