             Greek truck drivers voted to return
to work, bowing to government pressure and ending a six-day
strike that caused nationwide fuel shortages.  
 “With a sense of responsibility and by a marginal majority
we have decided on the suspension of the strike,” George
Tzortzatos, president of the Truck Owners Confederation, said in
comments broadcast on  Alter TV  channel in Athens today. “From
tomorrow, we will be back behind the wheel.”  
 The government last week deployed the military to ensure
the delivery of fuel and other vital goods after truck drivers
defied a government order to return to work. Truckers who
contravened the ruling faced possible criminal charges and
withdrawal of their licenses. The strike has caused fuel
shortages amid the country’s key summer tourism season.  
 Tzortzatos said the decision was taken in return for the
government lifting the civil mobilization order and pledging
discussions on a government law to open up their profession.  
 About 33,000 truckers, including tanker owners, are
protesting government plans to open up the freight industry and
issue licenses. The changes are a requirement of a 110 billion-
euro ($143 billion) loan package from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund.
