             The United Nations board that
oversees the world’s second-biggest greenhouse gas market
rejected more projects than it approved at a meeting in Bonn
that ended July 30.  
 The Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board rejected 22
projects requesting registration and approved 21 applications,
some conditionally, according to  minutes from the meeting 
published last week. The projects were seeking UN credits that
can be used for compliance in the European Union carbon market,
the world’s largest.  
 “The amount of projects rejected at this executive board
meeting is unprecedented,” said  John Romankiewicz , an analyst
in New York for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the research
company owned by Bloomberg LP.
