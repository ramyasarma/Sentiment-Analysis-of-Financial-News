             Magma Energy Corp.  may abandon its
takeover of HS Orka hf after the government decided to hold an
inquiry into the deal, the Financial Times reported, citing
Magma’s Chief Executive Officer  Ross Beaty .  
 The takeover, which was scheduled to complete this week,
would have been the biggest foreign investment in Iceland since
the country’s banking crisis, the FT said.  
 While Magma could try to close the transaction, it is also
weighing postponing or canceling the deal, Beaty said, the FT
reported.
