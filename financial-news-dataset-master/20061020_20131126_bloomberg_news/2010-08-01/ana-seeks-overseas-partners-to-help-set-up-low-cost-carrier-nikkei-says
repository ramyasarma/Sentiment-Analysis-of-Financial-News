             All Nippon Airways Co. may select
partners to set up a new low-cost carrier as early as next
month, Nikkei English News said, without citing anyone.   
 ANA may take a stake of between 30 percent and 50 percent
in the new company, with overseas airlines and investment funds
owning slightly less than 30 percent, the report said. The
airline will be set up as early as next year, the report said.
