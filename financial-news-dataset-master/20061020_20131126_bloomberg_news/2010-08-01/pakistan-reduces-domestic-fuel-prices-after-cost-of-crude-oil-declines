             Pakistan decreased domestic fuel
prices, bringing them in line with international rates after the
cost of crude oil declined.  
 The government reduced the price of gasoline from today to
67.74 rupees (79 cents) a liter from 67.95 rupees and light
diesel oil to 61.35 rupees from 61.66 rupees, the Islamabad-
based Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority said in a  statement  on its
website. The price of kerosene oil was decreased to 64.85 rupees
a liter from 65.38 rupees, it said.  
 “The revision was necessary due to decrease in the Arab
Gulf petroleum product prices over the month of June,”
according to the statement.  
 Pakistan, which has a population of 170 million people,
imports more than 80 percent of the fuel it uses.
