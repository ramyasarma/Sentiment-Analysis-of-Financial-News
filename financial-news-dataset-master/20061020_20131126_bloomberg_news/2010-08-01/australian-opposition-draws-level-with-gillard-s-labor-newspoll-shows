             Australia’s Liberal-National
Coalition has drawn level with the ruling Labor party in
popularity, a Newspoll opinion survey shows. Both sides have 50
percent voter support, with Labor dropping 2 percentage points
from a week earlier, and the opposition advancing by the same
amount, according to a telephone survey of 1,137 voters taken
between July 31 and yesterday and published in the Australian
newspaper. The margin of error is 3 percentage points.
