             Emirates Telecommunications Corp.,
the biggest of two phone companies in the United Arab Emirates,
said it was informed today by the regulator to suspend
BlackBerry services providing email, web browsing, instant
messaging and social networking from Oct. 11.

mobility products and services for its existing BlackBerry
customers,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
