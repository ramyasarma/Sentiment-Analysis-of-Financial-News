             Police in the southern Chinese city
of Guangzhou broke up a rally by hundreds of people who defied
government orders and staged a rally to defend the Cantonese
dialect, which they say has been marginalized, the South China
Morning Post reported today. Several journalists were taken away
for police questioning, the Post said, citing Lam Kin-shing, a
correspondent for Hong Kong’s Cable TV.
