             Russia may sell some government-owned
companies’ assets to Chinese state investment funds, the Sunday
Times reported, citing Russian bankers it didn’t identify.  
 Preliminary talks have taken place with government
officials from Russia and China, the newspaper said. Chinese
state funds could act as investors in Hong Kong share sales of
Russian companies, the Sunday Times said.  
 The government said last week it planned to sell holdings
in  OAO Rosneft , Russia’s largest oil producer, within three to
five years to help narrow the  budget deficit . The Finance
Ministry also proposed selling minority stakes in companies
including Russia’s two largest lenders, OAO Sberbank and VTB
Group.
