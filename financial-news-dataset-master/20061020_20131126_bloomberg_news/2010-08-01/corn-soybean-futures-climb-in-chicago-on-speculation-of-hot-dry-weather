             Corn for December delivery added 0.2
percent to $4.075 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 7:22
a.m. Singapore time. Soybeans for November delivery traded at
$10.0825 a bushel, up 0.3 percent. Wheat for September delivery
was unchanged at $6.615 a bushel after swinging between gains
and losses.  
 Twenty-four of 31 traders and analysts surveyed from
Chicago to Tokyo on July 30 said corn will rise and 23 predicted
soybeans will advance on speculation that hot, dry weather in
August will reduce U.S. yields as drought cut crops in Russia
and parts of Europe, shrinking global supplies.
