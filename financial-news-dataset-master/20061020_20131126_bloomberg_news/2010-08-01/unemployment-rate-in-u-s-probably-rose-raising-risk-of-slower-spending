             Unemployment probably climbed in
July, raising the risk American households will keep a lid on
spending for the rest of the year, economists said before a
government report this week.  
 The  jobless rate  rose to 9.6 percent last month from 9.5
percent in June, according to the median estimate of 57
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead of a Labor
Department report Aug. 6. A drop in federal census workers as
the population count wound down depressed payrolls by 60,000,
the data may also show.  
 Both  manufacturing , which led the U.S. out of the
recession, and service industries kept cooling last month,
indicating the economic recovery waned at the start of the
second half, other reports this week may show. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke last month said joblessness is “the
most important” problem facing the economy.  
 “The poor job picture is the Achilles heel of the
economy,” said  Sung Won Sohn , a professor of economics and
finance at California State University-Channel Islands in
Camarillo, California. “Reflecting the lackluster job market,
consumers have become more cautious about spending.”  
 The Census Bureau said it let go about 144,000 of the
people conducting the decennial population count from mid-June
to mid-July. It still had about 200,000 temporary workers on
staff as of July 17, indicating additional cuts to come that
will keep distorting the payroll figures for months.  
 Private Employment  
 For that reason, economists say private employment, which
excludes government jobs, will be a better gauge of the state of
the labor market for much of 2010. Employment at companies rose
by 90,000 after an 83,000 gain in June, according to the median
forecast.  
 “We are getting job gains, but they just don’t feel good
enough,” said  Jonathan Basile , an economist at Credit Suisse in
New York.  
 Joblessness, which reached a 26-year high of 10.1 percent
in October, will take time to recede as the number of previously
discouraged jobseekers returning to the labor force exceeds the
number of available jobs.  
 Factory payrolls  increased in July for the seventh straight
month, according to the survey. Health and education fields have
also been adding workers.  
 Household spending rose 0.1 percent in June following a 0.2
percent gain the previous month, economists project a report
from the Commerce Department Aug. 3 will show.  Incomes  likely
increased 0.2 percent after climbing 0.4 percent.  
 ‘Focused on Saving’  
 “Consumers seem to be focused on saving and spending only
on necessities, and that’s likely to continue through the rest
of the year,” said  Ryan Sweet , a senior economist at Moody’s
Economy.com Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania.  
 Tomorrow, the Institute for Supply Management’s
manufacturing  index  will show factories expanded in July, albeit
at a slower pace for a third straight month, according to
economists surveyed.  
 The rebound has boosted manufacturers’ shares. The Standard
& Poor’s Supercomposite Industrial Machinery Index of 52
companies, including Caterpillar Inc. and  Deere & Co ., has
increased 14.5 percent so far this year compared with a 1.2
percent decline in the broader S&P 500.  
 Some companies are adding staff in the U.S. Vestas Wind
Systems A/S, the world’s largest wind-turbine maker, plans to
hire 850 workers at its Colorado plants over the next year.  
 More Orders  
 “Throughout 2009 we didn’t see any orders in the U.S.
whatsoever,” Vestas spokesman Michael Holm said in a telephone
interview from the company’s Randers, Denmark, headquarters.
“That is changing. We see the market is easing up.”  
 Another report from the Institute for Supply Management,
due Aug. 4, will show service industries in the U.S. expanded in
July at a slower pace compared with the previous month. The
index of non-manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90
percent of the economy, fell to a five-month low of 53, from
53.8 in June, according to the survey median. Readings above 50
signal expansion.  
 The housing market is one area showing signs of weakness in
the wake of an expired government tax incentive for homebuyers.
 Construction spending  fell in June for a second consecutive
month, dropping 0.5 percent after a 0.2 percent decline in May,
economists said ahead of a report tomorrow from the Commerce
Department.  
 An index of signed  purchase agreements , or pending home
resales, climbed 3.7 percent in June after plunging a record 30
percent the previous month, economists projected an Aug. 3
report from the National Association of Realtors will show.
