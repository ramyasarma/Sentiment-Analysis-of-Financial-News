             Robinson Cano ’s ninth inning solo
home run, his 21st of the season, gave the New York Yankees a
5-4 win over the Tampa Bay Rays and a two-game lead in Major
League Baseball’s American League East Division.  
 The victory guarantees the Yankees (66-37) will head home
with the division lead whatever the outcome of tonight’s third
game in the weekend series at Tropicana Field. The Rays, with
the second-best record (64-39) this season, scored a 3-2 win on
July 30 and now trail New York by two games.  
 Alex Rodriguez  had one hit and one strikeout last night as
he again failed to hit a 600th career home run. The third
baseman has gone 37 straight at-bats without a homer, the
longest wait for any of the seven players who have reached the
600 milestone.  
 Mark Teixeira  hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning to
tie the game at 3-3, and  Nick Swisher  again tied it for the
Yankees at 4-4 with a solo home run in the seventh.  
 John Jaso  scored on  Evan Longoria ’s sacrifice fly to give
the Rays a 1-0 lead in the first.  Curtis Granderson  drove home
Rodriguez in the second to tie the score at 1-1.  
 The Rays moved ahead 3-1 on  Carl Crawford ’s RBI single in
the third and  Jason Bartlett ’s sacrifice fly that drove in B.J.
Upton in the fifth.  Matt Joyce  added a solo homer for the Rays
in the sixth.  
 David Robertson  (2-3) struck out two batters in one inning
pitched to get the win, and  Mariano Rivera  got his 22nd save,
giving up a hit and striking out one in one inning.  
 Rafael Soriano  (2-1) surrendered one hit and one run while
striking out one in one inning for the loss.
