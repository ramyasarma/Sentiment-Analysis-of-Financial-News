             Aldar Properties PJSC  dropped to the
lowest since March 2009 as Abu Dhabi’s biggest property
developer had a third consecutive quarterly loss and Standard &
Poor’s cut its credit rating to junk.  
 Aldar fell as much as 4.9 percent to 2.34 dirhams. The
shares traded at 2.39 dirhams as of 10:34 a.m. in Abu Dhabi.  
 The second-quarter loss was 475.3 million dirhams ($129
million), according to Bloomberg calculations based on first-
half data provided by the company. The average estimate of seven
analysts was for a loss of 210 million dirhams in the quarter.  
 The developer’s long-term issuer credit rating was lowered
six levels to BB-, the third highest junk ranking, from A- by
S&P, citing declining profits and real estate prices. The
outlook is negative.  
 Aldar’s “profitability and cash flow have been
significantly affected by, and continue to be under pressure
from, challenging real estate market conditions,” the rating
company said in a report on July 30. “The downgrade also
reflects a revision to our government support assumptions for
Aldar.”
