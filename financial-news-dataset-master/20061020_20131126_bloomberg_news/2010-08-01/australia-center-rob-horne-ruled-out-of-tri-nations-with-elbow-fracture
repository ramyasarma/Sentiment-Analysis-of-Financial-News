             Australia center Rob Horne will miss
the rest of rugby’s Tri-Nations championship after scans
revealed a small fracture in his right elbow.  
 The 20-year-old, who made his sixth appearance for the
Wallabies in a 49-28 defeat to New Zealand in Melbourne two days
ago, also has ligament damage, the Australian Rugby Union said
in a statement.  
 “It’s bad luck for Rob, but he’s made an encouraging start
to his international career, starting in every Test that we’ve
played this year,” Wallabies coach  Robbie Deans  said in the
statement.  
 Loose forwards Scott Higginbotham and Ben McCalman, and
winger Cameron Shepherd have been added to the squad to play New
Zealand on Aug. 7 in Christchurch.  
 The All Blacks lead the championship with 15 points after
three straight wins. Australia has four points from two matches,
while South Africa has lost all three of its games.
