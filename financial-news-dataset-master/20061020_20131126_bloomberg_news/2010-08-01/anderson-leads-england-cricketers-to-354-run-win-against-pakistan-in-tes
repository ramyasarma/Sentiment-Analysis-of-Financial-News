             James Anderson  finished with 11
wickets as England beat Pakistan by 354 runs in the first
cricket Test in Nottingham.  
 The swing bowler claimed 6-17 in Pakistan’s second innings
to help dismiss the visitors for 80 -- their sixth-lowest score
in Tests.  
 “We’re very satisfied with what we’ve done,” England
captain  Andrew Strauss  said at the post-match presentation.
“There’s a lot to be happy with but we’re looking for
consistency, and one match doesn’t make you consistent.”  
 Pakistan’s  lowest Test score  was 53 against Australia in
October 2002. Today’s total is the team’s worst against England,
surpassing the 87 scored at Lord’s in London in June 1954.  
 Anderson wrapped up the victory today when  Mohammad Asif 
edged to  Graeme Swann  in the slips. Only Danish Kaneria, 16 not
out, and  Imran Farhat , 15, reached double figures.  
 Stuart Broad  and Steven Finn each got two wickets. Along
with Anderson they took all the Pakistan wickets in this Test,
with spinner Swann bowling only two overs in the first innings
and none in the second.  
 “Our bowling was first class on a wicket that helped the
bowlers quite a lot,” Strauss said.  
 England scored 354 in its first innings after winning the
toss and electing to bat. Pakistan was then bowled out yesterday
for 182, before England declared on 262-9, Matt Prior making 102
not out.  
 The second match in the four-Test series starts Aug. 6 in
Birmingham.
