             (Corrects name in headline of story published on Aug. 1)  
 Indiabulls Infratech Ltd. paid 90
percent more than the reserve price for land in central Mumbai
auctioned by India’s state-owned National Textile Corp.  
 Indiabulls paid 4.74 billion rupees ($102 million) for the
Podar Mills (Process House) land in central Mumbai, National
Textile Corp., or NTC, said in a statement dated yesterday.  
 Indiabulls Infratech Ltd., Lodha Ultimate Buildtech & Farms
Pvt. and DB View Infracon Pvt. were among eight companies vying
to buy the 2.39 acres (9,664.4 square meters) of land, according
to the ministry of textiles. The auction of the plot, which had
a minimum price of 2.5 billion rupees, ended yesterday.  
 National Textile, which is selling 10.77 acres in the
central Mumbai area of Worli in two auctions, hopes to raise 20
billion rupees, Textiles Minister Dayanidhi Maran said in New
Delhi on July 29. That will account for part of the 50 billion
rupees it aims to get in the year ending March 31 by selling
properties in cities including Bangalore and Kanpur.  
 “We hope to hold at least 10 more such e-auctions and the
prices expected from the sales will go much beyond our target of
50 billion rupees,” National Textile Chairman K. Ramachandran
Pillai said in the statement.  
 Peninsula Real Estate Management Pvt. and Videocon Realty &
Infrastructures Ltd. are among seven companies that will bid
from Aug. 4 to Aug. 6 for an 8.37 acre plot. The government has
set 7.5 billion rupees as the minimum price for the land.
