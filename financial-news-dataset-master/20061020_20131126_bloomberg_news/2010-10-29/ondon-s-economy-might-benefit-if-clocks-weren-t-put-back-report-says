London’s economy might benefit if
the clocks weren’t put back this weekend, according to a study
published today by Mayor  Boris Johnson .  If Britain adopted Central European Time, London could see
“significant” economic benefits from the extra hour of
daylight gained at the end of the day during the winter months,
a report by GLA Economics entitled “Single Double Summer Time:
The Time is Right for London” concluded.  Tourism might be boosted by 240 million pounds ($381
million) to 720 million pounds a year, with attractions able to
stay open later in the day, said the report on the  London
government  website. Companies would see improved trading and
working with European customers and suppliers, it added.  Adopting unified summer time would mean that the time in
Britain would be the same as in France, Germany or Italy
throughout the year.  The change would be made by not putting the clocks back on
the last Sunday in October and thereafter putting them forward
on the last Sunday of March and then back in October. British
Summer Time was established in 1916 to give farmers more
daylight hours to work in their fields.  To contact the reporters on this story:
