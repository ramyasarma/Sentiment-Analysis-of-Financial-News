Kia Motors Co. , South Korea’s
 second-biggest automaker , boosted profit 66 percent in the third
quarter as new models increased sales at home, in China and the
U.S.  Net income  rose to 666.6 billion won ($593 million) in the
three months ended Sept. 30 from 402 billion won a year earlier,
the Seoul-based company said in a statement today. That beat the
504 billion won average of 16 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales climbed 26 percent to 5.69 trillion won.  Kia raised global deliveries 24 percent as new models
including the  K5  midsize sedan and revamped Sorento sport-
utility vehicle lifted sales at home and overseas, according to
company data provided before the earnings announcement. In South
Korea, Kia’s biggest market, sales rose 25 percent even as
deliveries at  Hyundai Motor Co. , which owns 34 percent of Kia,
declined 12 percent.  “Sales of Kia’s new models increased even with higher
prices,”  Lee Myung Hoon , a Seoul-based analyst at E*Trade
Securities Co., said before the earnings announcement. “It’s
likely there’ll be record quarterly earnings in the fourth
quarter.”  Kia shares rose 0.6 percent to 43,800 won as of 9:46 a.m.
in Seoul trading, compared with the benchmark Kospi index’s 0.9
percent decline. The stock has more than doubled in 2010.  Operating profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, rose 34 percent to 421 billion won, Kia
said.  Gains from Affiliates  The carmaker’s global retail sales increased to 541,884

according to company data. China sales climbed 18 percent and
North America deliveries 8 percent.  Higher profits from Kia affiliates including  Hyundai Mobis
Co.  and  Hyundai Steel Co.  also boosted earnings.  Hyundai Mobis, South Korea’s  largest  auto-parts maker, said
yesterday third-quarter  profit  jumped 45 percent to 605 billion
won as Kia and Hyundai Motor, its biggest clients, sold more
vehicles.  Hyundai Motor said yesterday its  net income  surged 38
percent to 1.35 trillion won for the quarter on higher sales in
overseas markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
