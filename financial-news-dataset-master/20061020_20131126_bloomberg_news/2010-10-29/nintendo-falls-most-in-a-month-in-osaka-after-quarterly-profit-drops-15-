Nintendo Co. , the world’s largest
maker of video-game players, fell the most in a month in Osaka
trading after the company posted a 15 percent drop in second-
quarter profit on lower demand for the Wii and DS.  Nintendo  declined 2.6 percent to 20,740 yen as of 9:47 a.m.
on the Osaka Securities Exchange, poised for the biggest drop
since Sept. 30. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.4 percent.
The shares have lost 5.9 percent this year.  Net income  fell to 23.2 billion yen ($286 million) in the
three months ended September, as revenue declined 41 percent to
174.5 billion yen. The figures were derived from first-half
results released by Kyoto-based Nintendo yesterday.  Nintendo is forecasting its smallest annual profit in six
years as demand for the Wii slumps and consumers hold off on
buying DS players before the release of a 3-D model. President
 Satoru Iwata  plans to introduce the 3DS handheld this fiscal
year and a heart-rate-tracking “Vitality Sensor” accessory for
the Wii to revive  earnings growth .  The company sold 4.97 million Wii consoles in the first
half ended Sept. 30, a 14 percent drop from a year earlier,
while sales of DS players fell 43 percent to 6.7 million units.
 Nintendo  kept its outlook for full-year sales of the handheld to
decline 13 percent to 23.5 million units and Wii sales to drop
15 percent to 17.5 million units.  Nintendo  said in June that the 3DS handheld, whose debut
was pushed back until after the year-end holiday season, will
allow users to see 3-D images without the need for special
glasses. The product has three cameras and a motion sensor to
create the 3-D effect.  The 3DS will go on sale in Japan on Feb. 26 for 25,000 yen
and the following month in the U.S. and Europe, where the price
hasn’t been set, Nintendo said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
