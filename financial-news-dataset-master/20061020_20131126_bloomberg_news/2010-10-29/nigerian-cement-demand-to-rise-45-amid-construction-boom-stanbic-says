(Corrects periods in first and second paragraphs of story
published on Oct. 29.)  Demand for cement in Nigeria, sub-
Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy and the continent’s most
populous nation, is expected to rise 45 percent in 2011, Stanbic
IBTC Bank Plc said.  Output of the building material may increase 63 percent
next year, while demand will surge to as much as 47.9 million
metric tons a year by 2014, Lagos-based analysts including Tomi
Ajai, Bunmi Njugo and Esili Eigbe wrote in an e-mailed report
dated Oct. 27.  “Nigeria is one of the lowest cement-consuming countries in
the world,” with 17.4 million tons consumed in 2009,
representing 116 kilograms (256 pounds) per person compared with
325 kilograms each in the developed market and 550 kilograms in
developing markets, they said.  Demand is being driven by a construction boom as the
country, Africa’s top oil producer, embarks on the provision of
houses, schools, roads and bridges for its 150 million people.
Local demand for cement is expected to increase as government
revenue climbs due to higher oil prices, Lagos-based Access
Investments and Securities Ltd., a unit of  Access Bank Plc , said
in a research note in May.  Nigeria expects to attain self-sufficiency in the
production of cement and become an exporter in 2013, when
production is forecast to reach 22 million metric tons, compared
with the government’s projection of domestic demand at 20
million metric tons, Commerce and Industry Minister Jubril
Martins-Kuye said Sept. 30.  Capacity Expansion  Domestic producers such as  Dangote Cement Plc , Africa’s
biggest producer of the material, Lafarge SA’s local unit,
Ashaka Cement Plc and Cement Company of Northern Nigeria Plc,
are expanding their plant capacity to meet rising demand.  Lafarge WAPCO Nigeria Plc’s  price estimate was raised to
48.5 naira, from 42.5 naira, while its recommendation was
maintained at “hold,” Stanbic said.  Ashaka’s rating was reduced to “sell” from “buy,” with
a price estimate of 25.3 naira, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
