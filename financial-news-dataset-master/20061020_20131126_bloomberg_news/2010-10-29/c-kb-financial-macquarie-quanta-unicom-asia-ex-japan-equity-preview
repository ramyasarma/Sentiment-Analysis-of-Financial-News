The following companies may have
unusual price changes in  Asian trading , excluding Japan. Stock
symbols are in parentheses, and share prices are from the
previous close, unless noted otherwise.  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.  (762 HK): The country’s
second-biggest mobile-phone company posted profit that missed
analysts’ estimates because of rising costs to attract
smartphone users. Third-quarter net income fell 73 percent to
742 million yuan ($111 million), from 2.72 billion yuan a year
earlier, according to figures derived from nine-month earnings.
The Beijing-based company was expected to post profit of 1.1
billion yuan, based on the median of four analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. China Unicom dropped 0.5 percent to
HK$11.02.  HTC Corp.  (2498 TT): The world’s largest maker of handsets
using Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. operating systems said
fourth-quarter sales may reach NT$100 billion ($3.3 billion),

Korea’s largest bank said third-quarter profit fell 53 percent
to 81.3 billion won ($72 million) after setting aside more

277.2 billion won average of 15 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg in the past 28 days. The shares fell 1.4 percent to
50,000 won.  Macquarie Group Ltd.  (MQG AU): Macquarie Chief Executive
Officer Nicholas Moore said investor confidence is returning
along with corporate appetite for mergers, and predicted second-
half profit may rise to the highest in three years. Macquarie,
Australia’s biggest investment bank, gained 4.8 percent to
A$36.20.  Quanta Computer Inc.  (2382 TT): The world’s largest maker
of notebook computers by shipments posted its first profit
decline in a year after the U.S. market slowed and Apple Inc.’s

NT$5.84 billion ($191 million) from NT$6.11 billion a year
earlier, the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company said in a statement.
