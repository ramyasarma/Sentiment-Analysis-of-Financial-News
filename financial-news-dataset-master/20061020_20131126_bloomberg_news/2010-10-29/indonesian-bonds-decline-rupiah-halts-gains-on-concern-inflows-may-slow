Indonesian bonds declined this week,
pushing the yields on the government’s benchmark notes to the
highest in a month, on speculation global funds are selling the
country’s assets. The rupiah weakened over the month.  The rate on the government’s benchmark 11 percent note due
November 2020 rose 41 basis points for the week, the most since
the five-day period ended May 7, to 7.58 percent, according to
midday prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The
yield, which declined 14 basis points today, reached 7.02
percent on Oct. 14, the lowest level since the debt was sold in
May 2005.  “The risk appetite for Indonesian notes was exaggerated,”
said Gundy Cahyadi, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp. in Singapore. “The general sentiment among investors is
for profit taking.”  Foreigners increased their  holdings  of government bonds by
77 percent this year to 191.1 trillion rupiah ($21.4 billion) as
of Oct. 26, according to the finance ministry’s website.  The rupiah traded at 8,938 per dollar as of 3:40 p.m. in
Jakarta, from 8,939 yesterday, according to Bloomberg data. It
was unchanged for the week and had declined by 0.3 percent this
month. The currency has advanced 5.1 percent this year as global
funds bought a net $2.3 billion of Indonesian stocks.  The rupiah was stable after the central bank signaled it
will limit appreciation that may hurt exporters. Bank Indonesia
is studying options on capital inflow, Perry Warjiyo, a director
at the central bank, told reporters in Jakarta today.  Bank Indonesia will “guard” the currency at its
fundamental level of 8,900 to 9,300 against the dollar, Governor
Darmin Nasution said Oct. 27, a day after the rupiah reached a
three-year high of 8,896. Central banks intervene in currency
markets by arranging purchases or sales of foreign exchange.  The rupiah’s level “is consistent with Bank Indonesia’s
fundamentals,” said  Tetsuo Yoshikoshi , a senior economist at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Singapore. “Bank Indonesia may
not want to further curb capital inflows. There has been some
slow down this month in foreign purchases of Indonesian bonds
and equities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
