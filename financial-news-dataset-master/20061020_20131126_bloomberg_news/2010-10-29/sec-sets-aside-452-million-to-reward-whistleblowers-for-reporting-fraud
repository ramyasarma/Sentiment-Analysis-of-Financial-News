The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission set aside about $452 million to reward tipsters under
new authority granted by the Dodd-Frank law, the agency said in
a  report  to Congress posted on its website today.  Whistleblowers who help the SEC prosecute fraud cases will
receive as much as 30 percent of the money the agency collects
in cases where sanctions reach at least $1 million.  Congress gave the SEC the authority to increase bounties
and awards for whistleblowers after faulting the agency for
missing  Bernard Madoff ’s Ponzi scheme and failing to curb Wall
Street practices that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
Before the Dodd-Frank law was enacted, the SEC could only reward
tipsters in insider trading cases.  The agency has yet to pay any whistleblowers under the new
authority and is still drafting rules to define the program, the
report said. The fund, which also finances the SEC’s inspector
general’s office, is financed by a portion of monetary sanctions
collected by the SEC that aren’t paid to harmed investors, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
