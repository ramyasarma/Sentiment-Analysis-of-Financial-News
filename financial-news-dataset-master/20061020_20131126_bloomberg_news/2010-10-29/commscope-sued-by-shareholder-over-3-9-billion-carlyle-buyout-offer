CommScope Inc.  was sued by a
shareholder over claims that the Carlyle Group’s $3.9 billion
buyout of the telecommunications-equipment maker undervalues the
company.  Carlyle, the world’s second largest private-equity firm
after Blackstone Group LP, said Oct. 27 that it would buy
Hickory, North Carolina-based CommScope for $31.50 a share in
cash. Shareholder Dennis Rice yesterday accused the buyout firm
and CommScope directors of taking advantage of a drop in company
shares, in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint in Wilmington.  “Carlyle recognized CommScope’s solid performance and
potential for growth and determined to capitalize on the recent
downturn in the company’s stock price at the expense of
CommScope’s shareholders,” lawyers for Rice said in the
complaint. “Company executives are favoring Carlyle over other
potential bidders.”  The offer represents a 36 percent premium to the closing
price on Oct. 22, the last trading day before CommScope said it
was in talks to be acquired by Washington-based Carlyle.  The deal would be the biggest takeover in the
telecommunications-equipment industry in at least two years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Four deals disclosed in
the industry in the last year have been valued at $1 billion or
more with an average premium paid of 43 percent.  CommScope Chief Executive Officer  Frank Drendel  and other
directors would fare better than shareholders in the proposed
deal, Rice said in the complaint.  Severance Pay  Six CommScope executives would receive as much as
$18.7 million in severance or change of control payments or both
if they leave within two years of a change of control, lawyers
for Rice said in court papers, citing the Charlotte Observer.
Drendel would receive as much as $6.6 million.  Company directors are favoring Carlyle “to guarantee their
continued employment,” Rice said in the complaint.  Rice is seeking to represent all CommScope shareholders. He
wants a judge to bar the deal and award unspecified damages.  A CommScope spokesman,  Rick Aspan , didn’t return a phone
call seeking comment.  CommScope rose 2 cents to $31.66 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 4:15 p.m. The shares have gained 19 percent
this year.  The case is Rice v. CommScope Inc., CA5936, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
