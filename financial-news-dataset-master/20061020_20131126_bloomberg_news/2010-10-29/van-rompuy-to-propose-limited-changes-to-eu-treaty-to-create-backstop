Herman Van Rompuy, the European
Union’s president, said he will propose “limited changes” to
the EU treaty in order to establish a permanent financial-
backstop facility.  “We’ve agreed we have to have this permanent crisis
mechanism and in order to have this crisis mechanism we have to
have this limited amendment to the treaty,” Van Rompuy told a
press conference today after a meeting of EU leaders in
Brussels. “We have to be absolutely sure that when setting up
the crisis mechanism it has to hold water in constitutional
terms in the member states,” he said.  “This mechanism could be so important for the survival of
the euro zone,” Van Rompuy said. “We have to make sure all the
assurances are in place.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
