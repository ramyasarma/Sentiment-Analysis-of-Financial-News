Foreign investors bought a net 8.51
billion pounds ($13.5 billion) of U.K. government debt in
September, a third monthly increase, amid speculation that the
Bank of England may buy bonds to support the economy.  The amount compared with a net purchase of 8.68 billion
pounds in the prior month and 5.61 billion pounds in July,
according to Bank of England data published today.  The amount of gilts held by overseas investors rose to a
record 274.45 billion pounds at the end of June from 243.58
billion pounds at the end of March, according to data from the
Debt Management Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
