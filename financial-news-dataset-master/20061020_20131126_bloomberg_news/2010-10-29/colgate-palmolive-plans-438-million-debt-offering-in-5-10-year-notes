Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) , the world’s
largest toothpaste maker, sold $500 million of notes in its
first bond offering since agreeing to purchase Unilever’s Sanex
personal-care unit.  The company split the sale evenly between three- and six-
year securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
three-year 1.25 percent notes were priced to yield 30 basis
points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries while the six-
year 2.625 percent bonds pay a 77 basis-point spread.  Colgate-Palmolive, which began as a starch, soap and candle
business in 1806, agreed to buy Sanex for about $940 million
last month, pursuing its biggest purchase in more than a decade
to expand in deodorant and body wash overseas. The New York-
based company will also sell its Colombian laundry detergent
business to Unilever for $215 million, it said in a March 23
statement. The Sanex transaction “will likely” be financed by
cash and short-term debt, Moody’s Investors Service said in a
March 23 note.  The maker of Ajax cleaners and Irish Spring bar soap has
$3.2 billion of long-term debt, compared with $2.8 billion at
the end of December, according to its most recent quarterly
filing. Moody’s assigns the company an Aa3 grade while  Standard
& Poor’s  rates it AA-.  In its last  bond issue  in October, Colgate-Palmolive sold
$438 million of 5- and 10-year notes, Bloomberg data show. The
1.375 percent notes due in November 2015 were priced at a 38
basis-point spread, the data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
