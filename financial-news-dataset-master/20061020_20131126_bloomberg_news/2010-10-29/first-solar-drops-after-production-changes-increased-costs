First Solar Inc. , the world’s
biggest maker of solar power modules, fell the most in five
months in New York trading after changes in production processes
increased average panel costs for the first time in at least two
years.  First Solar dropped $12.26, or 8 percent, to $138.93 as of
11:22 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Earlier the
Tempe, Arizona-based company, which is up 11 percent over the
past year, fell to as low as $138.13.  For the third quarter, First Solar’s average cost per watt,
the lowest in the industry, climbed 1 cent to 77 cents as
efforts to improve production lines slowed output, Chief
Executive Officer Rob Gillette said yesterday on a conference
call. He’s trying to reduce costs as global production capacity
almost doubles to 2,700 megawatts in 2012.  “They had some glitches that slowed things down,” said
Dan Ries, an analyst at Collins Stewart in New York who has a
“buy” rating on the shares and owns none. “It’s a negative
for now, but if they can show some improvements down the road
it’s a forgivable miss.”  Analysts at Deutsche Bank and Macquarie downgraded the
stock to “hold” from “buy” and to “neutral” from “hold”
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
