U.K. natural gas fell as a liquefied
natural gas terminal’s new jetty received its first cargo and
temperatures next week may exceed the seasonal norm. Day-ahead
power advanced on forecast higher demand.  The Isle of Grain LNG terminal east of London received its
first cargo at a new jetty today as part of its third-phase
expansion, National Grid Plc said in an e-mailed statement.  “Grain LNG now has the largest tank capacity of any
terminal in the U.K. with total storage availability of one
million cubic meters, equivalent to more than two days worth of
average U.K. gas demand,” National Grid said.  E.ON AG and Iberdrola SA jointly delivered the first cargo
aboard the Arctic Princess tanker. More cargoes will follow as
the new storage tank cools down to operating temperature.  Gas for November fell 1.5 pence, or 3.1 percent, to 46.20
pence a therm as of 4:30 p.m. in London, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s equal to $7.40 a million
British thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btus. The front-month
contract has risen 37 percent this year and gained 1.1 percent
this month.  Flows from Norway through the  Langeled  pipeline, the
world’s longest subsea gas link, reached their highest rate in
four days, rising about 5 percent to 69 million cubic meters a
day at 4:30 p.m. London time, data show.  The network manager forecast demand for the fuel in the 24
hours through 6 a.m. tomorrow at 267 million cubic meters at 4
p.m. That’s 20 million below the seasonal norm.  Kollsnes Plant  Gassco AS, operator of Norway’s pipeline network, couldn’t
be reached to comment on the capacity of its Kollsnes gas export
plant that supplies the U.K. and mainland Europe. The plant
hasn’t been at full exports since it returned from planned
maintenance on Sept. 27.  Temperatures from Oct. 30 through Nov. 8 “are expected to
range from near normal to perhaps notably mild for the time of
year, especially in eastern parts of the U.K.,” the  Met Office 
said on its website.  Gas for next week fell 1.15 pence to 46.25 pence a therm.
Within-day gas declined 1.7 pence to 47.40 pence a therm. Gas
for tomorrow dropped 2.6 pence to 45.25 pence.  Power demand for Nov. 1 is forecast to peak at 50,800
megawatts, 11 percent more than today, according to the grid
manager. U.K. baseload power for Nov. 1 rose 1.25 pounds to
44.25 pounds a megawatt-hour. Baseload is delivered around the
clock.  To contact the reporters on this story:
