U.S. officials are searching a
United Parcel Service Inc. airplane in Newark, New Jersey, for
one or more packages that originated in Yemen, according to a
person familiar with the inveestigation. The search is in
conjunction with a probe of a UPS plane in Philadelphia.
Officials in the United Kingdom had found a toner cartridge with
wiring on a plane in that country, removed that package, and
alerted U.S. officials to look for packages that came from the
same Yemeni shipper, the person said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
