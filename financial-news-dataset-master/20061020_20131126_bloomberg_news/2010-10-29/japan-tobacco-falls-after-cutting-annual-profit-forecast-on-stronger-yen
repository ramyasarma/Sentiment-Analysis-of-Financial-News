Japan Tobacco Inc. , the world’s
third-largest publicly traded cigarette maker, fell the most in
a year in Tokyo trading after cutting its full-year net income
forecast because of the stronger yen.  Japan Tobacco  dropped as much as 6.4 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since October 2009, to 243,900 yen and traded
at 246,000 yen as of 10:27 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Net
income  may total 115 billion yen ($1.4 billion) in the year
ending March, compared with an earlier estimate of 133 billion
yen, the company said yesterday.  A stronger yen, which has risen against all the world’s
major currencies in 2010, will trim sales gains at Tokyo-based
 Japan Tobacco  by reducing the repatriated value of overseas
 earnings . The company acquired RJR Nabisco’s international
businesses in 1999 and the U.K.’s Gallaher Group in 2007 to
expand abroad as the number of smokers in Japan declines.  “The company’s reliance on overseas markets is increasing,
so the impact from a stronger yen is inevitable,” said  Yasuhiro Matsumoto , a senior analyst at Shinsei Securities Co. in Tokyo.  The company, which sells cigarette brands including Mild
Seven, Winston and LD, has raised prices in markets including
Russia and Turkey.  Revenue  rose 8 percent to 3.3 trillion yen in the six
months ended September, the company said.  Operating profit 
increased 22 percent to 198.9 billion yen while  sales  after
excise taxes gained 5.2 percent to 1.3 trillion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
