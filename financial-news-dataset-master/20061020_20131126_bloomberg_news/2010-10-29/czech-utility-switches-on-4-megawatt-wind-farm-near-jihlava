CEZ Obnovitelne Zdroje, the
renewable energy arm of Czech utility and generator CEZ AS, has
opened a 4.1-megawatt wind farm at Veznice, close to Jihlava.  A statement on CEZ’s website said that the plant includes
two MM92 turbines made by  Repower Systems AG  and was designed
and built by Skoda Praha Invest.  The plant will supply electricity to about 3,000 local
consumers and bring supplemental annual funding to the Veznice
village budget, the CEZ statement said.  The company recently started another similar 4-megawatt
plant at Janov, close to Litomysl. Two turbines there were made
by the Czech company Wikov. More such small plants are planned
within the framework of the group’s “Futuremotion” switch to
clean energy strategy, according to the CEZ statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
