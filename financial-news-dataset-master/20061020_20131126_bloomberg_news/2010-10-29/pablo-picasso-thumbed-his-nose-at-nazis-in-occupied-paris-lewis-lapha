When the Nazis marched into Paris in
1940, many artists fled, while others were deported or killed.  Though offered sanctuary in the U.S.,  Pablo Picasso  chose
to stay in the city and keep working.  The most famous painter in the world was not necessarily
secure: He’d been denied French nationality and as an ardent
supporter of the defeated Spanish Republic, he could at any time
be arrested at Franco’s request and deported. Picasso also gave
money to the Resistance and sometimes hid fugitives in his home.  His studio on the rue des Grands-Augustins was often
visited by German officers. One brought a postcard of
“Guernica,” Picasso’s 1937 lament for the Basque town bombed
by the Luftwaffe. “Did you do this?” asked the German.  “No, you did!” replied Picasso.  I spoke with  Alan Riding , author of “ And the Show Went On:
Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris ,” on the following topics:  1. Jewish Artists Exiled  2. Nazi Censorship  3. Picasso and the Role of the Artist  4. Resistance vs. Collaboration  5.
