The  Bovespa  stock index rose,
capping a second monthly gain, as homebuilders and retailers
rallied on easing concern policy makers will raise borrowing
costs to cool the economy.  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes  led
gains for homebuilders as traders pared bets for higher
borrowing costs.  Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de
Acucar  and Lojas Americanas SA, Brazil’s biggest publicly traded
retailers, jumped more than 3.8 percent.  “Interest rates are under control because inflation is
under control, and rates could fall over time,” said  Ed Kuczma ,
an emerging markets analyst at Van Eck Associates in New York,
which manages $21 billion and sold Petrobras shares this
quarter.  The Bovespa rose 0.5 percent to 70,673.30, capping a 1.8
percent monthly gain. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap index  climbed
1.5 percent to 1,426.71. The real increased 0.3 percent to
1.6991 today.  Interest Rate  Brazil’s benchmark interest rate adjusted for inflation may
drop to 2 percent from about 6 percent currently should the next
government deliver a budget surplus before interest payments of
3.3 percent of gross domestic product, Valor Economico reported,
citing estimates by Economic Policy Secretary  Nelson Barbosa .  Lojas Americanas jumped 4 percent to 18.29 reais. Pao de
Acucar gained 4.1 percent to 66.60 reais. Traders in the
interest-rate futures market bet on lower borrowing costs,
pushing the yield on contracts due January 2012 down 2 basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.34 percent.  Cyrela climbed 3.1 percent to 23.50 reais. BR Malls
Participacoes jumped 5.9 percent to 16.25 reais.  Brazil posted a record budget surplus in September after
the government sold oil rights to state oil producer Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, boosting federal revenue.  Brazil had a budget surplus of 11.8 billion reais ($6.9
billion) in September, the first surplus since April, the
central bank said. The figure comes after a 10.5 billion reais
deficit in August, and was higher than the median forecast of
11.2 billion reais of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
