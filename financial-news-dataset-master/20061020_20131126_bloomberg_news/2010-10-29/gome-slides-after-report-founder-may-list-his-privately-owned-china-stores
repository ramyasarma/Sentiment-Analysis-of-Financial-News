Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings
Ltd.  dropped the most in almost three months after a newspaper
reported founder  Huang Guangyu  may list 400 privately owned
Gome-branded stores.  Gome, China’s second-biggest electronics retailer, tumbled
as much as 7.6 percent to HK$2.57 in Hong Kong trading, the
biggest intraday drop since Aug. 6. The stock was down 6.5
percent at the 12:30 p.m. trading break while the benchmark Hang
Seng Index declined 0.7 percent.  Huang may call for an extraordinary general meeting if
negotiations with the company fall through, the Hong Kong
Economic Times reported today, citing the billionaire’s
spokesman Gu Pengyun. Huang called on  Gome  Chairman Chen Xiao to
resign, it said.  Gome  and Huang are negotiating over the listed company’s
procurement and management contracts with his privately owned
stores, corporate lawyer Zou Xiaochun said Oct. 20.  Huang, fighting from jail for control over China’s second-
biggest electronics retailer, last month failed to win investor
support for his proposals install his sister and Zou as
directors and to oust Chen. He’s serving a 14-year sentence
after being convicted in Beijing in May of bribery, insider
trading and illegally buying foreign currency.  He won approval for his proposal to cancel a mandate to
sell new shares, which may dilute his stake the company he
founded. He and wife Lisa Du Juan hold about 32.5 percent of
Gome’s shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
