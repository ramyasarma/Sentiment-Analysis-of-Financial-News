UBS AG foreign-exchange strategists
ended a recommendation to sell the pound versus the Norwegian
krone for a 1.9 percent loss after sterling appreciated.  “Recent U.K. data has been surprisingly good,” making
additional asset purchases by the Bank of England unlikely this
year, UBS strategists said in an e-mailed note. “The Norwegian
krone, on the other hand, has suffered from continuously benign
inflation and a more dovish-than-expected October rate
decision.”  The pound rose 0.5 percent to 9.4339 kroner as of 7:43 a.m.
in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
