Lenders to  Abu Dhabi National Energy
Co. , the state-run utility known as Taqa, plan to start
syndicating $3 billion of revolving credits, according to two
people familiar with the situation.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., BNP Paribas SA,
Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc and Standard Chartered Plc may invite a wider group of banks
to join the loan as soon as today, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information is private.  Allan Virtanen, an Amsterdam-based spokesman for Taqa,
wasn’t immediately able to comment.  The facility is comprised of a $2 billion three-year credit
line and a $1 billion five-year portion. The deal will help Abu
Dhabi-based Taqa refinance $3.15 billion of debt due next year,
the people said.  Taqa agreed to pay interest of 65 basis points more than
the London interbank offered rate on money it draws from the
three-year credit signed in 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Moody’s Investors Service ranks Taqa’s debt A3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
