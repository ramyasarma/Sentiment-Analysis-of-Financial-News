Three bottles of  Chateau Lafite’s 
1869 vintage each sold for a record price of HK$1.8 million
($230,000) at a sale in Hong Kong last night, underlining Asia’s
dominance of the auction market for trophy label wines.  All three were bought by the same Asian telephone bidder,
said  Sotheby’s , which offered almost 2,000 bottles of Lafite
shipped directly from the cellars of the chateau in Pauillac,
near Bordeaux. The 1869s -- the oldest bottles in a range of
vintages that spanned 139 years -- were each estimated to sell
for between HK$40,000 and HK$60,000, said Sotheby’s.  Lafite had also held the previous auction record for a
single bottle of wine.  Malcolm Forbes , the U.S. publisher, paid
105,000 pounds ($168,000) for a 1787 vintage engraved with the
initials of President  Thomas Jefferson  at  Christie’s
International  in London in 1985.  “This was a perfect storm,”  Serena Sutcliffe , Sotheby’s
international head of wine, said in a telephone interview after
the sale. “Lafite is Bordeaux’s most starry name, the
provenance gave buyers extra confidence and the timing was
right.”  The auction raised HK$65.5 million with fees, against a
high estimate of HK$19.5 million at hammer  prices . Every one of
the 284 lots found buyers.  Selling Rate  All eight of the wine sales Sotheby’s has held in Hong Kong
this year achieved 100 percent selling rates, the New York-based
company said. As the Asian buyer had acquired three bottles of
Lafite 1869, there was a likelihood that at least one of them
may be opened and drunk, dealers said.  Wines produced before the phylloxera epidemic devastated
France’s vineyards in the 1870s rarely appear on the market,
Sutcliffe said.  “There will be a huge curiosity to try a great pre-
phylloxera vintage,” Sutcliffe said. “There’s a lot of
speculation about why the Chinese like Lafite so much. People
say it’s because the name is easy to pronounce in Mandarin.
Actually, they like the taste, otherwise they wouldn’t pay such
high prices for these wines.”  All 10 of the auction’s most expensive lots fell to Asian
private collectors. A single bottle of Lafite 1870 sold for
HK$1.3 million, and a 12-bottle case of the chateau’s 1982
vintage for HK$1 million, against low estimates of HK$80,000 and
HK$280,000 respectively.  Lafite  came top of the first official quality-based
classification of Medoc wines in 1855. The chateau was bought by
Baron James de Rothschild in 1868, and bottles have since been
labeled Lafite-Rothschild.  ( Scott Reyburn  writes about the art market for Muse, the
