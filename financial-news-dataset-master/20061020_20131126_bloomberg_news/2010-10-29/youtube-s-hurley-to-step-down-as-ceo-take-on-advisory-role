YouTube Inc. Chief Executive
Officer  Chad Hurley  said he’s moving to the role of advisor at
the world’s largest video-streaming site and plans to start
another company at some point.  Speaking a technology conference in Dublin last night,
Hurley said he “would have loved to stay independent” before
Google bought the company in 2006 for $1.65 billion, though the
search-engine giant has allowed YouTube to operate with a large
degree of autonomy.  “I am transitioning now into the role of advisor,”
Hurley said. “It is something that I have been working on for
the last two years.”  Hurley said he wants to start another company after
YouTube, which would be “something that I would use and others
would find useful too.”  Hurley founded YouTube with  Steve Chen  and Jawed Karim in
February 2005. He formerly worked at EBay Inc.’s Paypal. Under
Google, YouTube has grown from 67 employees to more than 600,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
