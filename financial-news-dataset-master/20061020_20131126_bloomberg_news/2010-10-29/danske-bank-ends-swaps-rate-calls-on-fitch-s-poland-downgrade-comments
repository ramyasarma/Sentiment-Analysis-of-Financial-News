Danske Bank AS ended its
recommendation to buy Polish two-year interest-rate swaps,
citing Fitch Ratings’ warning that it may downgrade the
country’s credit rating unless the government cuts its deficit.  The Copenhagen-based bank Bank advised investors on Oct. 18
to trade a fixed rate of 4.77 percent for two years in exchange
for floating-rate payments in anticipation that the fixed rate
would fall to 4.58 percent within the next three months. The
recommendation was based on speculation borrowing costs in the
European Union’s biggest eastern member won’t increase in 2011.  “The warning from Fitch is certainly not good news and
could change the market perception of Polish ‘country risk,’”
 Lars Christensen , chief emerging-market analyst at Danske Bank,
wrote in a research note. “We share Fitch’s concerns on the
budget situation in Poland.”  Poland’s credit rating may be downgraded if the government
doesn’t plan “a substantial and sustainable” reduction in the
budget deficit by 2012, Piotr Kowalski, Fitch Ratings’ head of
operations in the country, said in an Oct. 27 interview in
Warsaw published today.  “The problem is the government’s forecasts on the deficit
and debt have been wrong in recent years, which raises our
skepticism over its plans and constitutes a problem for
investors,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
