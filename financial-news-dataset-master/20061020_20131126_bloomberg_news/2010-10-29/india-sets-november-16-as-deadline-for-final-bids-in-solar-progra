Companies shortlisted to qualify for
incentives under India’s program to boost solar power generation
will have to submit final bids by Nov. 16, a government official
said.  “They will inform the eligible people, who will give their
bids by Nov. 15 or 16,” Deepak Gupta, secretary at the Ministry
of New and Renewable Energy, told reporters today in Noida,
outside of the capital New Delhi. “That will be the date to
watch for.”  Solar project developers have submitted applications to
build at least three times the proposed capacity of the National
Solar Mission’s first set of projects. The program offers
incentives such as special tariffs and a power-bundling
arrangement designed to assure projects of buyers.  Since the applications exceeded the capacity to be awarded,
developers are being selected based on the discount they’re
willing to offer for the rate at which they sell their
electricity. The commission set a price of 17.91 rupees ($0.40)
a kilowatt-hour for solar photovoltaic projects and 15.31 rupees
for solar thermal projects.  The National Solar Mission seeks to increase India’s grid-
connected solar capacity to 1,000 megawatts by 2013 and 20,000
megawatts by 2022. The invitation for applications to build the
first round of projects, including 150 megawatts of solar
photovoltaic plants and 470 megawatts of solar thermal plants,
closed Sept. 24.  Under the  program , power trading company NTPC Vidyut Vyapar
Nigam Ltd. will buy the output of the solar plants and bundle it
with cheaper coal-fired electricity from its parent  NTPC Ltd. 
The bundled power will be sold to distribution companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
