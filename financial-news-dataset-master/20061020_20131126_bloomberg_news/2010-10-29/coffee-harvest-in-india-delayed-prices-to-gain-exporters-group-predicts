The coffee harvest in India, the
third-biggest grower in Asia, will be delayed by excess monsoon
rainfall, adding to global supply problems that have driven
prices to multiyear highs, an exporters’ group said.  The picking of beans may begin from the middle of November,
three weeks later than normal, said  Ramesh Rajah , president of
the Coffee Exporters Association of India. India’s output and
exports may still reach a record in the year from Oct. 1 after
the rain boosted crop conditions, he said in an interview.  India’s harvest delay may help to extend rallies in arabica,
which jumped to a 13-year high this week, and robusta, which is
at the highest level in more than two years. Prices have jumped
on concerns that unfavorable weather in Latin America and
 Vietnam  and shipment delays in Brazil’s Santos Port are curbing
global supplies. India cultivates both types of bean.  “Coffee prices may continue to climb until weather
concerns ease in Brazil and Vietnam,” said Rajah, who correctly
predicted a 10 percent gain in prices on Aug. 24. India’s
“harvest has got delayed but the good news is that the crop is
in excellent condition,” he said yesterday from Bangalore.  Arabica reached $2.046 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York on Oct. 26, the highest price since August 1997, and the
December-delivery contract ended yesterday at $1.966. Robusta
advanced to $1,975 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London
yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 6, 2008.  India’s total coffee production this year may match a
forecast of 308,000 tons by the state-run Coffee Board, Rajah
said. The harvest of robusta, used in instant coffees, may be
more than the 208,500 tons estimated by the board, he said.  Monsoon Persists  The monsoon has yet to withdraw from the Southern Indian
states of Karnataka and Kerala, which account for more than 90
percent of the nation’s production, according to the weather
bureau. The June-to-September rainy season, which brings more
than 70 percent of India’s annual precipitation, is still active
over the region, according to the  state-forecaster .  Rainfall in Vietnam, the biggest grower of robusta, may
slow shipments and push back harvests, traders and growers said
last week. Output of the next crop in Brazil, the world’s
biggest overall producer, may drop to 36 million, 60-kilogram
bags, the lowest in four years, after a drought hindered
flowering, the nation’s coffee council said on Oct. 22.  Coffee shipments from producing nations will decline for a
second year in 2010 from last year’s estimated 95.5 million bags
and 2008’s 97.7 million bags, according to the International
Coffee Organization.  “Roasters have waited long on the sidelines for prices to
cool and with the winter approaching they may begin to cover
needs,” Rajah said. Arabica may gain to $2.13 a pound, while
robusta may climb to $2,150 a ton in the next few weeks, he said.  Exports from India, Asia’s third-biggest supplier, may
reach at least 260,000 tons this year through December, 39
percent more than the 187,347 tons last year, Rajah said.
 Shipments  jumped 59 percent to 247,624 tons between Jan. 1 and
Oct. 26, data from the state-run  Coffee Board of India  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
