Hittco Tools Ltd.,  a supplier of
drilling equipment to companies such as Robert Bosch GmBH, plans
to spend 200 million rupees ($4.5 million) on an acquisition to
meet rising demand from India and China.  An acquisition will help the company expand faster and may
happen in a year or two,  Surendra Bhandari,  chairman of the
Bangalore-based company said in an interview, without
elaborating. “China is a major market as it accounts for about
40 percent of the total export revenue.”  Hittco is planning its first acquisition to tap rising
demand at home and from China, Asia’s two fastest growing major
economies. Manufacturing in China accelerated for a second
straight month in September, while Society of Indian Automobile
Manufacturers raised their sales growth forecast for the year
ending March 31 to 23 percent from 12 percent.  Shares  of the company, which have more than tripled this
year, fell 4.9 percent to 39.95 rupees in Mumbai at 10:03 a.m..
The benchmark sensitive index has risen 14 percent this year.  Revenue is forecast to increase 77 percent to 80 million
rupees in the fiscal year to March 31, Bhandari said. “Of this
exports will account for 25 percent.”  The  company  plans to invest 20 million rupees this year to
increase capacity from the present 120 tools a day to about 250
tools daily, Bhandari said. Hittco plans to borrow to finance
its acquisition, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
