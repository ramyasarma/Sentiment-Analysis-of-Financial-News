Cia. Sudamericana de Vapores SA ,
Latin America’s largest container shipping company, fell the
most in more than two months in Santiago trading after saying
rates and profit margins probably will decline this quarter.  Vapores dropped 2.1 percent to 652.14 pesos, the steepest
decline since Aug. 11 and the worst performance among stocks in
Chile’s benchmark equity index, the Ipsa.  The Valparaiso-based company erased an earlier gain after
saying in a  statement  accompanying quarterly earnings that
demand has been “less vigorous” since the third quarter.
Vapores reported record quarterly profit of $149 million
compared with a loss of $147 million a year earlier.  “Future conditions don’t seem as auspicious as the just-
ended quarter,” it wrote in a statement posted on the Chilean
securities regulator’s website. “Expectations for the fourth-
quarter are that global volumes won’t keep growing at the same
pace and even show some declines from previous months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
