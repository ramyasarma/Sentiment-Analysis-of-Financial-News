U.S. investors should invest
overseas as a hedge against higher taxes after November
elections and increase their allocations in Chinese and
Singaporean stocks, said Hartford Financial’s Robert Froehlich.  China is attractive because of “strong local consumer
demand,” Froehlich, senior managing director at Connecticut-
based Hartford Financial, which oversees $352 billion, said in
e-mailed comments. “In addition business investment also
remains strong. Good consumption along with good business
investment will bode well for the economy and the market.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
