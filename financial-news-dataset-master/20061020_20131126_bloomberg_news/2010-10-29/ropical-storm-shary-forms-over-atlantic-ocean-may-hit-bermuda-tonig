Tropical Storm Shary formed over the
Atlantic Ocean and may hit Bermuda tonight, where a warning has
been issued, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  Shary, the 18th named system of the June-through-November
Atlantic hurricane season, had sustained winds of 40 miles (65
kilometers) an hour, the hurricane center in Miami said in an
 advisory  on its website at about 11 a.m. East Coast time. The
system was 205 miles (330 kilometers) south-southwest of the
island group heading northwest at 9 mph.  “The center of Shary is expected to pass near or to the
east of Bermuda tonight and early Saturday morning,” according
to the advisory.  Bermuda’s tropical storm warning means winds of at least 39
mph are expected within a day, and the system may bring as much
as 3 inches (8 centimeters) of rain to the islands, the
hurricane center said. Hurricane Igor last month cut power to
two-thirds of Bermuda residents.  The official track shows Shary passing over Bermuda
overnight, then drifting northeast and dissipating in the North
Atlantic.  With the naming of the season’s 18th storm, the 2010 season
is now tied for the fifth-most active on record with 1969,
according to  Dennis Feltgen , spokesman for the hurricane center.
The hurricane center is also tracking two other systems in the
Atlantic that may become storms.  Storm Possibilities  The first, about 360 miles east-southeast of the southern
Windward Islands is given a 80 percent chance of becoming a
tropical cyclone, according to the hurricane center. The second,
about 1,300 miles west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, has
a 10 percent chance.  Feltgen said if either of those storms becomes more
organized with winds reaching 39 mph, 2010 would tie 1995 and
1887 as the third-most active season. The most active year was
2005 with 28 storms, followed by 1933, which had 21, he said.  Neither Shary nor the two potential storms in the Atlantic
poses a threat to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which is home to 31
percent of U.S. oil production and 10 percent of its natural gas
output, according to  Jim Rouiller , senior energy meteorologist
at Planalytics Inc. in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporters on this story:
