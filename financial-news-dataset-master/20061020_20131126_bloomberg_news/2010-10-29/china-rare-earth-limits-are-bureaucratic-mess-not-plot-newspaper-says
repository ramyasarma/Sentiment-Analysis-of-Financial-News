China halted rare-earth exports as
it attempted to reorganize the industry to halt pollution and
illegal production, not as part of a plot to wield power over
other governments, the South China Morning Post said, citing
Jack Lifton, head of Technology Metals Research.  China’s cutting exports without immediately explaining why
it had done so was a mistake, and caused a “bureaucratic
mess,” Lifton told a CLSA Asia Emerging Markets investor
presentation, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper
reported today, citing a transcript.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
