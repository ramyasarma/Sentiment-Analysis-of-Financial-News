French, German and U.K. companies
are interested in buying part or all of Hellenic Railways
Organization SA’s Trainose unit, provided Greece reorganizes its
railways,  Naftemporiki  reported.  Greek Transport Minister  Dimitris Reppas  met for the second
time yesterday with his French counterpart and with the
president of French state rail operator SNCF; however, the
Finance Ministry isn’t closing the door on German and British
interest, nor to offers from China and India, the newspaper
reported, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
