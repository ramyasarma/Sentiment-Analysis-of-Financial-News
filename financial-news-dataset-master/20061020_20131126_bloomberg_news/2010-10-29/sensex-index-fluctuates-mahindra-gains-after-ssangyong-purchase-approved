India’s stocks rose, snapping a
three-day decline, as  ICICI Bank Ltd.  and ITC Ltd. reported
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  ICICI Bank , the country’s second-biggest lender, soared to
the highest since February 2008 after second-quarter profit rose
19 percent. Overseas  investors  were net buyers of Indian
equities for a 41st day on Oct. 27, the longest streak on
record.  ITC , India’s biggest consumer goods maker, advanced the
most in a week after its quarterly profit rose 23 percent to the
highest in at least a decade.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
gained 91.30, or 0.5 percent, to 20,032.34 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The measure, which lost 0.7 percent this week,
completed its first monthly decline in five.  “I have a positive view on the banking sector, especially
longer term in the next one or two years,” said  Kaushik Dani , a
Mumbai-based fund manager with Peerless Mutual Fund, which
manages $598 million in assets. “Nobody doubts the long-term
growth story of India.”  The gauge has gained 25 percent from a May 25 low and is
the best performer this year among the world’s 10 biggest stock
markets. Foreign investment into local stocks has risen 70
percent this year, making the Sensex the most valuable benchmark
in Asia.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.5 percent to 6,017.70. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.1 percent
to 2,541.85.  ICICI Bank  ICICI Bank advanced 6.8 percent to 1,163 rupees. Profit
climbed to 12.4 billion rupees ($278 million) in the three
months ended Sept. 30 as loans increased for the first time in
two years and it cut provisions for defaults. The amount
surpassed the 11.5 billion rupee average of 32 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  ITC advanced 2.5 percent to 171.2 rupees. Quarterly net 
income  rose 24 percent to 12.5 billion rupees. That compared
with the 11.7 billion rupee average of 20 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Jet Airways India Ltd., the biggest airline, increased 1.1
percent to 809.9 rupees after it reported second-quarter profit
of 124 million rupees, compared with a loss of 4.07 billion
rupees a year earlier.  More Cash  India’s  central bank  said it will inject funds into the
banking system to ease a cash shortage after the nation’s record
share offering by Coal India Ltd. drained money.  Surplus cash in the banking system dried up as investors
withdrew money to pay for the shares of Coal India, the world’s
biggest producer of the fuel, at its initial public offering
last week. Orders at the sale reached 15 times the stock
available, helping the government raise 152 billion rupees.  Cairn India Ltd. , the producer of crude oil from the
nation’s biggest onshore field, gained 1.1 percent to 320.9
rupees after it tripled profit to a record 15.9 billion rupees
in the three months ended Sept. 30 after boosting output and
prices to meet rising demand.  Cummins India Ltd. , the maker of diesel truck engines and
generators, increased 2.3 percent to 794.65 rupees after being
raised to “buy” from “hold” at Religare Capital Markets by
equity analyst  Misal Singh . The 12-month target price is 950
rupees per share.  Global funds bought a net 977 million rupees of shares,
extending this year’s record inflows to 1.135 trillion rupees,
the Securities & Exchange Board of India said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
