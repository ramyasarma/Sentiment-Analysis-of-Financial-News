ITC Ltd. , India’s biggest consumer
goods maker, reported second-quarter  profit  rose 23 percent to
the highest in at least 10 years, beating most analysts’
estimates.  Net income  rose to 12.5 billion rupees ($281 million) in
the three months through September from 10.1 billion rupees a
year earlier, the Kolkata-based company said in a statement to
the Bombay Stock Exchange today. That compared with the 11.7
billion rupee average of 20 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales for Asia’s second-biggest cigarette maker by market
value grew 18 percent to 50.6 billion rupees from 42.9 billion
rupees a year ago.  ITC  plans to expand sales in its food, retail
and personal care products businesses.  “Across the board, there seems to be very strong
operational performance,” said Arnab Mitra, an analyst at IIFL
Ltd. “All the segments have done well. Cigarettes grew very
well, the fast-moving consumer goods losses have come down by
about 20 percent. Paper-margin expansion is also more than
expected.”  Revenue from the cigarette business was 25.5 billion
rupees, compared with 2.1 billion rupees derived from hotels 
and 10.6 billion rupees from food. The paper business earned 
9.2 billion rupees.  ITC shares rose 2 percent to 170.3 rupees at 1:35 p.m. 
in Mumbai trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
