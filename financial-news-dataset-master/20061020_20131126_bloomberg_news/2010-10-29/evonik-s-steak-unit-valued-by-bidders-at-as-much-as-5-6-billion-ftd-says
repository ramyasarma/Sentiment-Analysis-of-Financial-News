Bidders for a majority stake in
Evonik Industries AG’s Steag power plant unit are valuing the
business at 3.5 billion to 4 billion euros ($4.9 billion to $5.6
billion) as an offer period ends today, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  The buyer would pay as much as 700 million euros for the
stake after discounting pension obligations and minority
holdings in some of the unit’s assets, according to the report.  A group of German local utilities, the Czech Energeticky
Prumyslovy Holding, Germany’s Remondis AG, Turkey’s Park Holding
and India’s Hinduja Group have put in bids, the FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
