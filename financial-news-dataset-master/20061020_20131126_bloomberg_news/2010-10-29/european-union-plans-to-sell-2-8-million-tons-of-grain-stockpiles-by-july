The European Union plans to sell as
much as 2.8 million metric tons of soft wheat and barley from
stockpiles at tenders running through June.  The 2.71 million tons of barley and 88,112 tons of wheat
are held in member states as part of a market-intervention
program, the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said
today in an e-mailed statement. The intervention system  sets 
minimum prices, and then buys grain offered at those prices.  The tenders, starting Nov. 24, mean “the commission
retains control of both the volume and the price of the stocks
coming onto the market, and so we will follow the evolution
closely to make sure that the market is not disrupted,”
Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said in the statement.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Index  of eight
futures climbed 30 percent this year, led by corn and wheat, as
crops were damaged by floods in Canada, Pakistan and China and
drought in Russia and across Europe. That’s more than four times
the 7.2 percent advance in the wider S&P GSCI Index of 24
commodities.  The sales from intervention stockpiles had been called for
by livestock farmers after a jump in feed prices, the U.K.’s
Home-Grown Cereals Authority said in a statement last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
