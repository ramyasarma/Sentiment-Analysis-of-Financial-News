Brazil posted a record  budget
surplus  in September after the government sold oil rights to
state oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , boosting federal
revenue.  Brazil had a budget surplus of 11.8 billion reais ($6.9
billion) in September, the first surplus since April, the
central bank said. The figure comes after a 10.5 billion reais
deficit in August, and was higher than the median forecast of
11.2 billion reais of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s nominal budget deficit as a percentage of GDP fell
to 2.36 percent the year through September, the lowest since
December 2008 when it was 1.9 percent, according to central bank
data released today.  Brazil also posted a record  primary surplus , or the surplus
before interest payments of 27.8 billion reais, missing the
median forecast for a 30 billion-real surplus of 14 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Policy makers said their outlook for  inflation  to slow to
their 4.5 percent  target  depends on a more moderate expansion of
 credit  and government spending next year, according to the
minutes of their Oct. 19-20 meeting released yesterday. Brazil’s
government will tighten its fiscal policy in the next two years,
policy makers said in the minutes.  Brazil’s central government posted a  record surplus  before
interest payments in September after selling oil reserves for
shares as part of  Petroleo Brasileiro SA ’s $70 billion stock
sale, Treasury Secretary  Arno Augustin  said Oct. 26.  Without the oil-for-shares swap, the 26.1 billion-real
($15.3 billion) primary surplus would have been a deficit of 5.8
billion reais, according to Treasury data. The Petrobras deal
added 31.9 billion reais to the central government primary
surplus.  September’s surplus is the highest since the government
began the data series in August 1995. From January through
September, current spending grew 21.6 percent over the same
period of 2009. Total revenue rose 31.1 percent, while GDP grew
13.5 percent, Treasury data show. All the figures take inflation
into account.  As a percentage of gross domestic product,  net debt  fell to
40 percent, the lowest since March 2009, down from 41.4 percent
in August, the central bank said. The ratio may fall to 39.6
percent to 40 percent by year-end, the head of the central
bank’s economic department,  Altamir Lopes , estimates.  The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.7012 per U.S. dollar at 9:19
a.m. New York time, from 1.7042 on Sept. 28. In the overnight
interest-rate futures market, the yield on the contract due in
January 2013 fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point,
to 11.74 percent.  Latin America’s largest economy may expand this year at
 7.55 percent , its  fastest pace  in more than two decades, a
central bank survey of economists released this week showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
