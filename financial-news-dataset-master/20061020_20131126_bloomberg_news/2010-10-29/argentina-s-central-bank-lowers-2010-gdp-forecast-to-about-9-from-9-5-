Argentina’s central bank said the
country’s  economy  will expand about 9 percent this year while
higher commodity prices are likely to boost pressure on domestic
food prices.  In August, the Buenos Aires-based central bank raised its
limit for this year’s monetary expansion to 29.4 percent as it
expected the economy to expand as much as 9.5 percent.  The economy will slow in 2011, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
