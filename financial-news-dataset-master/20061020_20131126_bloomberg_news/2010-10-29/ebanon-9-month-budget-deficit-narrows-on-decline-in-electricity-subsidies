Lebanon’s budget deficit narrowed to
3 trillion Lebanese pounds ($2 billion) in the first nine months
as the government spent less on subsidizing its main electricity
generating company.  The deficit shrank from 3.35 trillion pounds in the same
period last year, the  Ministry of Finance  said in an e-mailed
report today.  The government spent 492.6 billion pounds less on subsidies
for  Electricite du Liban , which provides more than 90 percent of
the country’s electricity, the ministry said.  Lebanon had a budget deficit of 4.46 trillion pounds last
year and a 4.4 trillion-pound shortfall in 2008, averaging about
9.7 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
