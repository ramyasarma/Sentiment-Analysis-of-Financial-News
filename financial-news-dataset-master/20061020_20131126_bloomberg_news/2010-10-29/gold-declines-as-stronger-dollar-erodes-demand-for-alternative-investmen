Gold futures rose, capping a third
straight monthly gain, on speculation that the Federal Reserve
will increase debt purchases, weakening the dollar and boosting
the metal’s appeal as an alternative investment.  Gold is up 3.7 percent this month while the  dollar  has sank
1.9 percent against a basket of six major currencies on bets
that policy makers, meeting on Nov. 2-3, will announce another
round of so-called quantitative easing to bolster the economy.
The metal reached a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  “The market is anticipating and pricing for another round
of easing,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services in Chicago. “What stops the rally is if the
Fed just talks. There has to be some tangible evidence the Fed
is in the market buying back bonds to underpin the rally.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $15.10, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $1,357.60 at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price is up 24 percent in 2010, heading for the 10th
straight annual gain.  The Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate at between
zero percent and 0.25 percent since December 2008 and purchased
$1.7 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed assets to spur
growth.  Asset-Purchase Estimates  Estimates for the size of the Fed’s next round of asset
purchases range from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch to $2 trillion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Economists at
both firms agree the Fed may start by announcing a $500 billion
plan.  “There has been some speculation that widely anticipated
quantitative-easing steps by the Fed could fall short of market
expectations,” analysts at Deutsche Bank AG said today in a
report. “Gold prices could still rally if insufficient
quantitative-easing measures simply introduced new downside
risks to U.S. growth.”  Gold also rose after United Parcel Service Inc. said the
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation inspected possible
suspicious packages on three jets arriving from Europe.  Some traders also purchased the metal as a haven after the
U.S. Homeland Security Department put out an advisory on freight
flights.  ‘A Lot of Fear’  “There’s a lot of fear out there,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. “When traders hear about bomb scares, they buy gold
first and ask questions later.”  A toner cartridge on a cargo plane in London was checked
for explosives, and none were found, the FBI said.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 68.9 cents, or
2.9 percent, to $24.564 an ounce on the Comex, capping a 13
percent gain in October.  The price touched $24.95 on Oct. 14, the highest level in
30 years. The metal is up 46 percent in 2010.  Sprott Asset Management today launched an exchange-traded
product backed by silver. The fund trades on New York Stock
Exchange Arca. Bloomberg News tracks four other ETPs. iShares
Silver Trust is the largest, with holdings of almost 329 million
ounces.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $15.10, or 0.9
percent, to $1,707.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price is up 2.9 percent this month and has
advanced 16 percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery advanced $15.65, or
2.5 percent, to $645.10 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached
$646.25, the highest level since May 2001. The price advanced 13
percent in October and gained 58 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
