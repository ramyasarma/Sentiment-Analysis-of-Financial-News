Italy was awarded a 3-0 win over
Serbia in a 2012 European Championship qualifier abandoned on
Oct. 12 because of violence by Serbian fans, according to the
Italian soccer federation.  European soccer ruling body UEFA also ordered Serbia to
play at least one match without spectators and fined the Serbian
and Italian federations 120,000 euros ($167,000) and 100,000
euros, respectively, the Italian authority said  on its website .  Serbian fans threw flares onto the field and destroyed
stadium furniture, prompting the referee to stop the game in
Genoa, Italy, after six minutes. The start had been delayed 35
minutes because of crowd disturbances.  Italy leads the six-team qualifying group with 10 points
from four games. Serbia is second-last with four points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
