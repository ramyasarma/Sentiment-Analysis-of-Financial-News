Stefanel SpA  agreed to sell its 50
percent stake in Noel International SA, the owner of retailer
Nuance Group AG, to PAI Partners for 106 million euros ($147
million) to concentrate on its main clothing business.  PAI agreed to an “adjustment mechanism” in the deal which
could raise the price to as much as 120 million euros or cut it
to 97 million euros, according to statements from PAI and
Stefanel today. The sale is expected to be closed by the end of
February, the companies said.  Nuance, which manages about 370 shops, mostly in airports,
had sales of 1.58 billion Swiss francs ($1.6 billion) last year
and earnings before interest and taxes of almost 26.7 million
francs, according to the statements. Stefanel, based in Italy’s
Veneto region, reiterated today that it doesn’t consider its
stake in Nuance “strategic.”  “The sale will allow us to further focus on our project,
giving us the financial resources necessary to continue with our
investment plan,” Chairman  Giuseppe Stefanel  said.  Stefanel rose as much as 6 cents, or 9.2 percent, and
traded up 6.5 percent at 70.9 cents as of 11:35 a.m. in Milan,
giving the company a market value of 68 million euros.  “The tourism industry has a strong development opportunity
and retail will play a pivotal role within it,”  Raffaele Vitale , senior partner at PAI, said in the company’s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
