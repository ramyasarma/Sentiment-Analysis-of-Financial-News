Natural gas futures rose to a six-
week high, capping a second straight monthly gain, on forecasts
of cooler-than-normal weather in early November that may spark
demand for the heating fuel.  Below-average temperatures are expected along the U.S. East
Coast and parts of the Gulf of Mexico coast from Nov. 3 through
Nov. 7, according to Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda,
Maryland. The high temperature in New York on Nov. 5 may be 51
degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius), 6 degrees below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.  “The six-to-10-day forecast is a little colder, so you’ll
start to see more heating demand,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst
with PFGBest in Chicago. “The seasonality of the market is
starting to kick in a little bit.”  Natural gas for December delivery rose 14.8 cent, or 3.8
percent, to $4.038 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement price since
Sept. 16. The futures gained 4.3 percent this month and have
declined 28 percent this year.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  U.S. gas production rose 1.6 percent in August as output
from wells in the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana increased, the
Energy Department reported today.  Output increased to 72.38 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 71.27 billion in July, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said in a monthly report known as
EIA-914. The report covers gross withdrawals, which include
supplies that aren’t sold to end users.  Inventory Report  Gas stockpiles rose by 71 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Oct. 22 to 3.754 trillion, the Energy Department said
yesterday.  The increase surpassed the five-year average gain for the
week of 45 billion cubic feet, department data show. A surplus
to the five-year average rose to 9.1 percent from 8.4 percent
the previous week. A 1.3 percent deficit to year-earlier
supplies was erased.  Inventories reached a record 3.837 trillion cubic feet last
November.  The Energy Department said yesterday that prices may rise
above $4.50 per million Btu in the spot market this winter and
stay above that level through 2011.  The Energy Information Administration, the department’s
statistical arm, expects gas demand by the end of the year to be
4 percent higher than it was in late 2009, Richard Newell, the
agency’s administrator, said in Washington.  Tropical Weather  A cluster of showers and thunderstorms about 225 miles
southeast of Barbados has a nearly 100 percent chance of
becoming Tropical Storm Tomas within the next 48 hours, the
 National Hurricane Center  said in its tropical weather outlook
at 2:40 p.m. New York time.  Weather models  predicted that the
storm would veer east near Hispaniola or Puerto Rico, missing
energy production regions of the Gulf of Mexico.  “The storm is pointed toward the Gulf, but it looks as
though it will take its time in moving there and will face some
areas of significant wind shear along the way,”  Tim Evans , an
analyst with Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said in a
note to clients. “It may be prompting some short covering, but
we don’t see it as a reliable source of ongoing fundamental
support for natural gas prices.”  Tropical Storm Shary is likely to pass near Bermuda tonight
and early tomorrow, the hurricane center said.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, fell 0.07 cent to $3.3555 per million Btu on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
307,665 as of 2:51 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
266,000. Volume was 274,594 yesterday. Open interest was 802,102
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 810,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
