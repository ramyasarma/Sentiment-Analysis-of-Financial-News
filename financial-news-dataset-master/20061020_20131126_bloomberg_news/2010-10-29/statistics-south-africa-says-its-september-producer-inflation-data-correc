Statistics South Africa said the
producer-price inflation data it released yesterday are correct,
denying speculation there were errors in the figures.  “There was a misunderstanding on how it was calculated,”
the Pretoria-based agency’s spokesman Trevor Oosterwyk said in a
phone interview today, adding that Statistics South Africa may
issue a statement later. “The PPI data yesterday was correct.”  PPI slowed to 6.8 percent from 7.8 percent in August, the
agency said yesterday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
was for a reading of 8.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
