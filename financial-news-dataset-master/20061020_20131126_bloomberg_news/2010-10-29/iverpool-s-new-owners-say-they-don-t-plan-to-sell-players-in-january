Liverpool soccer club’s new owners
said they’re not planning to sell players after U.K. media
reports said goalkeeper Pepe Reina and striker Fernando Torres
will leave during the January transfer window.  “Stories about our top players leaving are destructive and
unwarranted, but we realise that this kind of speculation is
also common,” John Henry said today in an e-mailed statement.
“We intend to build on the strength of the current squad, not
undermine it. And I can reassure our supporters that we have no
intention of allowing the team to be weakened going forward.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
