AZ Electronic Materials, the
chemicals maker partly owned by Carlyle Group, jumped as much as
12 percent after its 383 million pounds ($609 million) initial
public offering.  The shares were trading up 8 percent at 260 pence at 9:05
a.m. in London. AZ sold shares for 240 pence each in the IPO,
the Luxembourg-based company said in a statement today. AZ will
get 251 million pounds in the IPO and owners including private
equity firms Carlyle and Vestar Capital Partners the remainder.  “We are delighted with the outcome of the IPO which
received an excellent response from major institutions,” Geoff
Wild, AZ’s chief executive officer, said in the statement. The
IPO “demonstrates investors’ confidence in our business.”  Carlyle and Vestar will each keep a stake of about 21
percent in AZ, according to a term sheet for the IPO. Depending
on demand, the shareholders may sell an additional 57 million
pounds of shares by exercising the over-allotment option.  Washington-based Carlyle paid about 518 million Swiss
francs ($524 million) to buy AZ from specialty chemical maker
Clariant AG in 2004. Vestar purchased a stake in the company
from Washington-based Carlyle in 2007.  Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are
managing the IPO, along with Collins Stewart Plc and Societe
Generale SA. Rothschild is an adviser to AZ and its
shareholders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
