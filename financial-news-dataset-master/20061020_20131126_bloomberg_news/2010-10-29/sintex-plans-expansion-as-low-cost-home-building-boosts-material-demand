Sintex Industries Ltd. , an Indian
engineering company, will spend 9 billion rupees ($202 million)
over two years to expand production of home-building equipment
as demand surges, Managing Director  Amit D. Patel  said.  “We are expanding our capacity every year, otherwise we
cannot meet such huge demand,” Patel said in a phone interview.  Expansion in the world’s third-fastest growing major
economy is boosting incomes for India’s urban population and
spurring demand for houses that may cost at least 2.5 million
rupees in a Mumbai suburb. About 8 million people live in slums
in India’s financial capital and surrounding areas, more than
the population of Switzerland.  Gujarat, western India-based Sintex will build new plants
to make concrete building blocks and prefabricated material in
India’s Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Karnataka states and expand
production lines, Patel said.  The shares rose as much as 4.1 percent and traded 1.9
percent higher at 202.35 rupees as of 2:31 p.m. in Mumbai,
taking gains this year to 48 percent. The benchmark Bombay Stock
Exchange Sensitive Index has added 14 percent in the period.  Sintex expects orders worth as much as 7 billion rupees
from state and central government for low-cost housing within
four months, he said.  Sales will increase 35 percent and profit by 40 percent in
the year through March, Patel forecast. That compares with
revenue growth of 7.1 percent and an increase in net income of
1.2 percent last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
