Spyker Cars NV , the Dutch supercar
maker that bought Saab Automobile this year, fell the most in
nine months in Amsterdam trading after cutting the Swedish
unit’s production goal as the third-quarter loss widened.  Spyker dropped as much as 1.09 euros, or 28 percent, to
2.84 euros, the  biggest intraday decline  since Jan. 28, and was
down 18 percent as of 12:57 p.m. That pared the stock’s gain
this year to 51 percent, valuing the Zeewolde, Netherlands-based
manufacturer at 64 million euros ($89 million).  The net loss was 39.9 million euros compared with a 4.06
million-euro deficit a year earlier, Spyker said today in a
statement. Saab will build 30,000 to 35,000 cars this year, down
from its plan in August to make 45,000 vehicles this year and an
initial target of 50,000 to 60,000 cars.  “It’s disappointing they had to adjust the production
target for the second time,” said  Martin Crum , an analyst at
Amsterdams Effectenkantoor BV who recently started covering
Spyker and will “soon” have a  recommendation  on the shares.
“That’s the big negative that’s pushing the stock down.”  Saab was on the brink of collapse until Spyker bought the
Trollhaettan-based carmaker from  General Motors Co . on Feb 23.
The brand resumed production in March after a break of two
months, and has been focusing on setting up dealerships and
introducing the 9-5 sedan. Spyker reiterated that it aims to
become profitable in 2012 as Saab sells 120,000 cars a year.  Reversing Liquidation  The reduced target for 2010 stems from Saab taking longer
than expected to recover from the plant shutdown and the
reversal of liquidation proceedings, Saab Chief Executive
Officer  Jan-Aake Jonsson  told reporters on a conference call.
Restoring ties with suppliers contributed to delays in the 9-5’s
rollout, he said.  “You will not sell product that’s not on the showroom
floor,” Spyker CEO  Victor Muller  said on the call. “It’s been
a tremendous fight to fill the pipeline. This is now finally
starting to happen.”  Saab’s future is “going to be difficult,” said Crum, the
Amsterdams Effectenkantoor analyst. “When  Spyker  bought Saab,
the factory was totally shut down, and of course it took a huge
effort to get things up and running again. On the plus side, the
company reaffirmed its target for 2011 and 2012.”  Muller reiterated his goal today of listing the company on
the Stockholm exchange by April 2011, saying Spyker
“definitely” wants its shares to trade simultaneously in
Stockholm and Amsterdam initially. The company will consider
dropping the Dutch listing “if it turns out that the Amsterdam
market is not sustainable because the trading volumes are not
high enough,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
