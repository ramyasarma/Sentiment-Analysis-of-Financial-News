The franc fell against the dollar
after economic data suggested Switzerland’s export-led recovery
is losing momentum.  The  monthly gauge  of Swiss leading economic indicators by
the KOF research institute, which aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead, slumped to 2.17 from 2.21, a
fourth monthly decline. Economists forecast a drop to 2.16, the
median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.  “The Swiss National Bank has probably become a bit too
optimistic about where the economy is going,” said  Steve Barrow , head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange research at
Standard Bank in London. “Momentum is still likely to move in a
more dovish direction and that’s been part of the reason why the
Swiss franc’s been softer and probably will continue to.”  The franc fell 0.2 percent to 98.52 centimes per dollar at
5:21 p.m. in London, after earlier weakening as much as 0.8
percent. The currency strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.3692 per
euro, erasing an earlier decline to 1.3739, the weakest level
since Aug. 11.  The Swiss franc has climbed 2.6 percent this year against a
basket of currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes. It has declined 2.1 percent in the
past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
