Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. 
has held discussions with 15 potential bidders as it seeks
alternatives to  BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s $40 billion hostile takeover
offer, the fertilizer producer said in a regulatory filing.  Talks with potential investors are continuing, Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp. said in the  filing  ahead of a
Nov. 8 hearing before the  Saskatchewan Financial Services
Commission , the province’s securities watchdog.  “The process of generating alternatives to the BHP offer
is complicated by the significant size and complexity of the
transaction and the significant political and regulatory
considerations involved,” Potash Corp. said in a filing dated
yesterday to the Regina-based commission.  BHP, the world’s largest mining company, has applied to the
commission to strike down Potash Corp.’s so-called poison pill,
a defense that’s designed to make a takeover prohibitively
expensive. Potash Corp. is seeking to keep the pill in place to
allow more time to consider alternatives to BHP’s $130-a-share
takeover offer.  Barbara Shourounis, director of the commission’s securities
division, said the hearing is scheduled to run two days and will
be held before a three-person panel.  Potash Corp.  rose $2.56, or 1.8 percent, to $145.09 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. BHP, the
world’s largest mining company,  fell  0.3 percent to 2,213.5
pence in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
