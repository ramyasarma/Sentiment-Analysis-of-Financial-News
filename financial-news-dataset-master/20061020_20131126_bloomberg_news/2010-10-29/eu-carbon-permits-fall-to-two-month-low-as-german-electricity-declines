European Union carbon-dioxide
allowances declined to their lowest level in two months as
German power dropped to its cheapest price since April 13,
cutting profits from generation.  EU permits for December fell 2.1 percent to 14.60 euros
($20.30) a metric ton as of 12:50 p.m. on London’s European
Climate Exchange. That’s the lower price since the weakest level
since Aug. 18.  German power for settlement next year declined 0.4 percent
to 47.50 euros a megawatt-hour as of 1:38 p.m. Berlin time,
broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
