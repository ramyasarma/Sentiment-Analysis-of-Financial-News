 Ceska Sporitelna AS, a Czech unit
of Erste Bank AG, said its net income for the first nine months
of the year declined 11.5 percent to 9.65 billion koruna as high
provisions and a declining loan portfolio pushed down earnings.  Net interest income declined 2.4 percent during the nine
month period to 22.8 billion koruna from 23.3 billion koruna,
the Prague-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
