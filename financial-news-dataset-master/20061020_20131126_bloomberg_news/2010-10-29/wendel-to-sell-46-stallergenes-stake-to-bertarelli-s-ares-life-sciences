Wendel , Europe’s third-largest
publicly traded private equity firm, will sell its 46 percent
stake in French allergy medicines maker  Stallergenes  to Ares
Life Sciences,  Ernesto Bertarelli ’s health-care investment
company.  Wendel, which has held an investment in Stallergenes for
almost 17 years, will receive 59 euros a share for a total of
358.8 million euros ($489.1 million), the Paris-based investment
firm said in a statement. Wendel and Ares are negotiating a
final agreement, and the deal must be approved by Stallergenes’
workers council.  Once the deal is approved, Ares will make a mandatory
takeover offer for the remaining outstanding shares of
Stallergenes at the same price, the Swiss investment firm said
in a separate statement. Ares plans to invest in Stallergenes’
French research and development and production facilities in
Antony and Amilly and help it expand to the U.S., Wendel said.  Stallergenes closed down 3.34 euros, or 5.2 percent, to
61.16 euros in Paris trading, the most since February 2009,
giving the company a market value of 810.5 million euros.  Stallergenes posted revenue last year of 193 million euros.
For 2010, the company expects sales to rise more than 10 percent
from a year earlier with a “significant” earnings increase.  Ares is owned by the Bertarelli family, which sold Swiss
biotechnology company Serono SA to Germany’s Merck KGaA in 2006
for $8.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
