Investors should buy the Canadian
dollar versus the krona after Sweden’s central bank lowered its
outlook for future interest-rate increases this week, RBC
Capital Markets said.  The exchange rate between the so-called loonie and krona is
“an ideal candidate for a catch-up trade” and the “most
mismatched” currency pair in the bank’s model,  Matthew Strauss ,
RBC’s Toronto-based senior currency strategist, said in an e-
mailed note.  Swedish tightening will “likely be far more muted than
originally anticipated,” and any pickup in U.S. growth in 2011
would also benefit the loonie, Strauss wrote.  RBC Capital is a division of Royal Bank of Canada, the
nation’s largest bank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
