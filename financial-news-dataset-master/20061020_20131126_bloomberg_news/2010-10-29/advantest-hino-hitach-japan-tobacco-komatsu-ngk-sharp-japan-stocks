rallied 7.2 percent to 726 yen, the steepest gain since June

publicly traded cigarette maker, lost 4 percent to 250,300 yen,

yen reduces overseas revenue.  Kansai Electric Power Co.  (9503 JT), Japan’s second-largest

on Ricoh.  Sharp Corp.  (6753 JT), Japan’s largest maker of liquid-
crystal displays, slumped 5.8 percent to 795 yen, the lowest
since March 2009. The company cut its annual net income forecast
by 40 percent to 30 billion yen, citing the stronger yen and
falling prices of panels.  Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.  (4063 JT), a chemicals maker,
slipped 3.4 percent to 4,075 yen. Shin-Etsu Chemical’s stock-
price estimate was lowered to 5,000 yen from 5,300 yen by
