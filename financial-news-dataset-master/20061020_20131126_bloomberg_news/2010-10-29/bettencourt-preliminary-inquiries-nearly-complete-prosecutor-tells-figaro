French prosecutors say four
preliminary investigations into allegations, including campaign
finance violations, tax evasion, influence peddling and
violation of privacy related to  L’Oreal SA  heiress Liliane
Bettencourt and Labor Minister Eric Woerth are “practically
complete,” Le Figaro said today, quoting Nanterre prosecutor
Philippe Courroye.  An audit should be handed in around Nov. 20, a report from
Swiss investigators into Bettencourt’s financial activities in
Switzerland should arrive mid-November, with some final
interviews, including that of Woerth, remain, Courroye, who has
led the inquiries, told the newspaper.  An investigating judge will take over Courroye’s case,
moving all Bettencourt-related probes, including one by trial
judge Isabelle Prevost-Desprez into allegations the 88-year-old
heiress’s “frailty” was abused by a friend, to “ensure a
serene treatment” of the affair, the newspaper quoted him as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
