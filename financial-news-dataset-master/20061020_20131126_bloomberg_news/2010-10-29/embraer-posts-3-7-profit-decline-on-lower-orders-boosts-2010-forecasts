Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica
SA , the world’s fourth-biggest aircraft manufacturer by market
value, posted a 3.7 percent decline in third-quarter net income
and boosted profit-margin forecasts for the full year.  Net income fell to 220 million reais ($129 million) from
228.4 million reais a year earlier, Embraer, as the Sao Jose dos
Campos, Brazil-based company is known, said in a regulatory
filing yesterday. Net sales fell to 1.82 billion reais from 2.34
billion reais.  Embraer’s commercial aviation deliveries decreased to 20
from 29 in the third quarter. Executive aviation deliveries fell
to 24 from 27 as industry demand failed to pick up globally.  “Deliveries were weak compared to our numbers across the
board,”  Joseph Nadol ,  Seth Seifman  and  Rica Mendoza , analysts
at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , wrote in an Oct. 14 note to clients,
“with medium and large business jets particularly light,
heightening our concern about depressed near-term demand.”  Embraer boosted its operating profit forecast to $380.6
million from $340 million for the year. The company also raised
the forecast for its margin on earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to 8.75 percent from 8 percent, by
U.S. accounting standards.  “We expect better results from Embraer in the fourth
quarter of 2010, due the concentration of deliveries at the end
of the year,”  Caio Dias , an analyst at  Banco Santander SA ,
wrote in an Oct. 25 report.  Embraer  fell 0.4 percent to 11.85 reais yesterday. The
company’s shares have gained 25 percent this year, while
Brazil’s  benchmark Bovespa index  has climbed 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
