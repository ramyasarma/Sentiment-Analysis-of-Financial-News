Polish central bank Governor  Marek Belka  led members of the rate-setting panel in rejecting a
motion to increase the  benchmark interest rate  in August.  The 10-member rate-setting board voted 6-4 against the
motion on Aug. 24, leaving the rate unchanged at record-low 3.5
percent, according to a vote breakdown published by the central
bank in its October inflation projection.  Andrzej Bratkowski ,  Andrzej Rzonca ,  Adam Glapinski  and  Zyta Gilowska  sought to increase the rate by half a percentage-point
to prevent inflation from accelerating to more than the central
bank’s target of 2.5 percent. Some policy makers also attempted
to boost the rate at the Sept. 29 meeting, according to minutes
published Oct. 21. The breakdown of that vote will be published
at the end of November at the earliest.  Earlier this week, policy makers again left the benchmark
rate unchanged, saying they wanted to protect the zloty from
excessive gains that could harm competitiveness of the local
economy. Poland has kept its key rate unchanged since June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
