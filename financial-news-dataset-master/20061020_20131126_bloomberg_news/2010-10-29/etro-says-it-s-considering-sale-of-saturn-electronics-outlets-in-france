Metro AG , Germany’s biggest
retailer, is considering the sale of its 34 Saturn consumer
electronics stores in France, saying the economic situation in
the country remains “challenging.”  The sale of some or all of the outlets is among “strategic
options” being considered, the Dusseldorf, Germany-based
company said today, adding that talks are being held with HTM
Group. Saturn also may continue its French operations with a
strategic partner, Metro said by e-mail.  Metro, Europe’s biggest retailer of consumer electronics
with 852 stores in 16 countries, plans to open several stores in
China starting next month. The French unit had sales of 583
million euros ($806 million) in 2009, about 3 percent of the
 total.  The unit employed 1,806 people at the end of the year.  “The assessment will be focused on a solution that is in
the best interest of the employees,” Metro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
