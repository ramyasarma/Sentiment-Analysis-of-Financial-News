National Australia Bank Ltd.  sold
A$1.35 billion ($1.32 billion) of five-year bonds, overtaking
Westpac Banking Corp. as the biggest issuer of domestic debt
among the nation’s banks this year.  The lender, based in Melbourne, sold A$800 million of
floating-rate notes priced to yield 120 basis points more than
the three-month bank bill swap rate, according to an e-mailed
statement today. It also sold A$550 million of 6.5 percent notes
priced to yield 6.62 percent, or 167.5 basis points more than
similar-maturity government debt.  National Australia has sold A$6.9 billion of bonds in its
home market this year, the most of any Australian lender,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank said on Oct.
27 that second-half cash profit rose 32 percent as it expanded
its share of the business loan market by targeting smaller
borrowers.  Westpac, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and
Commonwealth Bank of Australia have sold A$15.7 billion of debt
domestically between them, Bloomberg data show.  Westpac sold A$800 million of five-year bonds in June,
pricing the notes to yield 135 basis points more than swap
rates. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
