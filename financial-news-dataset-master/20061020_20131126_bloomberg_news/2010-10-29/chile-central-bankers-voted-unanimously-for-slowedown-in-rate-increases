Chile’s central bank committee
members voted unanimously to increase the benchmark interest
rate on Oct. 14 to 2.75 percent after considering raising to 3
percent.  The five-member policy board, led by bank President  Jose De Gregorio , raised the rate by a quarter point at the meeting.
They weighed a half-point increase and one policy maker
suggested leaving the rate unchanged, according to minutes of
the meeting published today on the central bank’s website.  The bank slowed the pace of  interest-rate rises  after four
straight half-point increases as prices rose less than expected
and the widening gap between Chilean interest rates and those in
developed economies pushed up the peso. Continued appreciation
of the Chilean peso could further reduce inflationary pressures,
and the bank will take into account lower interest-rate
expectations in other countries, it said in the statement.  “Domestic monetary policy should not be immune from what
happens in the rest of the world,” the bank said. “Otherwise,
Chile’s exchange rate and current account at trend prices could
deviate from a path towards sustainable long-term equilibrium.”  The peso had gained 3.1 percent against the U.S. dollar in
the month before the bank’s meeting. It has weakened 2.1 percent
since then. It appreciated 0.4 percent to 487.35 per dollar at
8.09 a.m. New York time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
