Palm oil declined from a 27-month
high after the discount at which it trades to rival soybean oil
narrowed to a three-week low.  The January-delivery contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 3,048 ringgit ($973)
a metric ton, extending the morning’s slide. The contract traded
at 3,057 ringgit at 4:57 p.m.  Yesterday, palm oil reached the highest since July 28,
2008, narrowing its discount to soybean oil to $87.05 a ton, the
least since Oct. 11. The world’s most-consumed edible oil cost
$98.41-a-ton  less  than Chicago soybean oil today, according to
Bloomberg data.  Palm oil “is taking cues from the weak global market” and
prices of soybeans and soybean oil in Chicago, said Veeresh
Hiremath, associate chief analyst at Karvy Comtrade Ltd., a
commodity brokerage based in Hyderabad.  The most-active contract gained about 12 percent in
October, heading for a fourth straight monthly rise, on
speculation that demand for oilseeds from China will remain at a
record high while a lack of rain may delay planting of soybeans
in Brazil, the second-largest producer after the U.S.  Soybeans traded in Chicago have climbed 11 percent this
month, heading for a fourth month of gains. They fell as much as
0.8 percent to $12.265 a bushel today, and were 0.7 percent
lower at $12.275 at 4:36 p.m. Singapore time.  Soybean oil has risen 8.8 percent this month. The contract
for December delivery lost as much as 1.8 percent to 48.79 cents
a pound today and last traded 1.3 percent lower at 49.05 cents.  China Factor  China, the biggest consumer of soybeans, has increased
imports because of rising domestic prices. Consumer prices
climbed 3.6 percent in September, the fastest pace in almost two
years, the country’s statistics bureau said last week.  Chinese beans are 44 percent costlier than Chicago beans,
Bloomberg data show.  Soybeans on the Dalian Commodity Exchange gained 6 percent
this month, a fourth month of gains. Dalian soybean oil advanced
10 percent in October, capping a 27-percent rally in the past
four months. The contract  for September delivery  lost 2.6
percent to 9,380 yuan ($1,406) a ton today.  Dalian palm oil gained 8 percent this month, rising for the
fourth straight month. Palm oil for May delivery, the most-
active contract, declined 1.9 percent to 8,318 yuan a ton today.  China will auction 250,000 tons of cooking oil in the
northwestern Xinjiang region from Oct. 27 in a bid to stabilize
prices, the State Administration of Grain said yesterday.  CME Group Inc.’s January palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, dropped 0.6 percent to $980.50 a ton
at 3:15 p.m. in Singapore.  Near-Term Positive  Any decline in palm oil prices may be short-lived as China
may step up orders for the Lunar New Year in February, according
to a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  Palm oil prices “will remain positive in the near term,”
Hiremath said. “It may take a correction to 3,000 ringgit and
may go up and touch 3,200 ringgit in the next 15 days,” he
said.  China may import 55 million tons of soybeans in the
2010-2011 marketing year, 8.9 percent more than the previous
year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast on Oct. 8.
Inbound shipments in 2009-2010 grew 23 percent from the previous
year, the USDA’s data show.  “India consumption demand is very strong,” Hiremath said.  Soybean oil imports by India may slump at least 19 percent
next year as a record local harvest of soybeans makes domestic
supplies cheaper, GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co. said Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
