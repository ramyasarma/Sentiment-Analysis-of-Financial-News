Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi denied that he intervened to secure the release of an
underage girl from police custody and said he just acted to help
someone in a tragic situation.  “I just helped a young girl in a tragic situation,” he
told journalists in Brussels after a summit of European Union
leaders. “I didn’t influence anyone. I know first hand that in
Italy the prime minister has no real power.”  Newspapers including La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera
reported that Berlusconi helped secure the release of a 17-year
old girl arrested in policy custody in Milan on suspicions of
theft. Berlusconi said that he only helped find someone to help
the girl after she was released because of her “tragic
situation.”  The newspapers reported that the girl later told police she
had attended parties at his home in Milan with other young women
who engaged in sexual games with the premier. Reports
that he paid women or promised them expensive gifts like cars
were “all lies,” he said.  “As far as what goes on at my house, I don’t need to clear
up anything,” he said. “Only people that behave well” are
allowed in.  Berlusconi told journalists today that he had no plans to
change his lifestyle and that he was a great host.  “At my age, nobody will be able to make me change my
lifestyle. I love life and fun; I love women,” he said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
