Allen Iverson  agreed in principle to
a two-year, $4 million contract with Turkish basketball club
 Besiktas .  Iverson, the former National Basketball Association Most
Valuable Player and 11-time All-Star, is expected to complete
the agreement this weekend and begin play the week of Nov. 8,
the team said in an e-mailed news release.  Iverson, who played 10-plus seasons with the Philadelphia
76ers before stints with the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons and
Memphis Grizzlies, returned to the 76ers in December before
stepping away in February to deal with an undisclosed family
matter.  The 35-year-old guard averaged 13.9 points and 4.1 assists
during his 25-game stay in Philadelphia, after lasting only
three games with the Grizzlies before being granted his release.  Iverson won the 2000-01 NBA  MVP award  and is 17th in career
points with 24,368. His 26.7 career points-per-game average
ranks sixth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
