Estee Lauder Cos. , the maker of Mac
cosmetics and Clinique skin care, surged the most since May 2009
after raising its annual sales and profit forecasts.  The stock climbed as much as 15 percent after the New York-
based company said today that profit will be at least $2.90 a
share, compared with a previous minimum projection of $2.80.
Sales will climb at least 7 percent on a constant-currency
basis, compared with a previous  target  of at least 6 percent.  Sales in Asia and in the skin-care line, which accounts for
more than 40 percent of total revenue, will fuel growth, Estee
Lauder said. The cosmetics maker, led by Chief Executive Officer
Fabrizio Freda, has posted four straight  quarters  of sales
growth as consumers began spending again, spurred by the global
economic recovery.  The performance contrasts with those of competitors Avon
Products Inc. and Revlon Inc., both of which  declined  yesterday
after reporting results that fell short of analysts’
projections. Avon said revenue came in "softer" than anticipated
last quarter, while Revlon’s sales for the period dropped 2.2
percent.  Estee Lauder shares rose $8.95, or 14 percent, to $73.36 at
10:39 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier
they climbed as high as $74.31.  Net income  in the first quarter ended Sept. 30 surged 36
percent to $191.1 million, or 95 cents a share, from $140.7
million, or 71 cents, a year earlier, Estee Lauder said. Sales
advanced 14 percent to $2.09 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
