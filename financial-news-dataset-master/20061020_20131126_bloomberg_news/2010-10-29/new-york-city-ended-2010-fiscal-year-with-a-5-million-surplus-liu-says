New York City ended fiscal 2010 with
a $5 million surplus in its $62.8 billion budget, the 30th
consecutive year in which the general fund’s revenue exceeded
expenses, city Comptroller  John Liu  said.  The city’s five pension funds paid $10.5 billion in
benefits during the year that ended June 30, closing the period
with $97.8 billion in total assets, Liu reported in his office’s
 annual review  of city finances. The funds posted a combined
return of 14 percent, compared with an 18 percent loss in 2009.  The city also ended the fiscal year with outstanding
general obligation debt of $41.6 billion, including $34 billion
of fixed-rate and $7.5 billion of variable-rate bonds, the
office reported.  “No matter how well the city performs, our economic growth
will be tied to the performance of the nation as a whole,” Liu
said in a statement accompanying the report. “Wall Street’s
rebound helped the city pension funds post gains of more than 14
percent, but did not do much to help curb high unemployment
rates.”  New York City’s seasonally adjusted jobless rate was 9.5
percent at the end of the fiscal year in June, matching the
national average. In September, it was 9.3 percent.  State law enacted during a 1975 fiscal crisis requires the
city to prepare a five-year financial plan and balance its
budget or face a takeover of operations by a state-controlled
Financial Control Board.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
