Germany’s Cartel Office is
considering opening an investigation into sales agreements used
by Deutsche Telekom AG with partners, the regulator’s spokesman
Kay Weidner said in a telephone interview today.  While the probe would not lead to a fine, the office may
order the telecommunications company to change contractual
clauses, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
