Mexico’s peso gained for a second
month, on increased speculation the Federal Reserve may buy
assets next week to increase liquidity and spur growth.  The peso increased 2 percent this month to 12.3449 per
dollar at 5 p.m. New York time, from 12.5935 on Sept. 30. The
currency rose 0.1 percent today and has gained 6.1 percent this
year. The peso jumped 4.9 percent last month, the most since May
2009.  The U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, the Commerce Department said, matching the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The Fed releases its monetary
policy decision Nov. 3, when it may announce that it’s buying
more assets to increase liquidity and help spur growth.  “The data hasn’t changed anything, it fell within
expectations,” said  Jorge Perez-Duarte , a managing director for
emerging markets at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto. “Everybody
has their eyes on the Fed next week.”  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose 2
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.34 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.24 centavos to 134.05 centavos on the peso.  Traders bought $600 million in dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website today. The options can be
triggered next month, allowing the bank to buy dollars as it
seeks to boost foreign reserves after the peso reached a record
low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
