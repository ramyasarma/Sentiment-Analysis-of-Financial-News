Immofinanz AG , Austria’s biggest
real estate developer, was initiated at “overweight” at Morgan
Stanley.  “Although 50 percent of its portfolio is western European,
the company’s relatively large euro-denominated cost base --
despite more than a 50 percent reduction last year --, together
with its euro-denominated debt and local currency income,
depress earnings and make it a highly geared play on Eastern
European currencies,” analysts led by  Christopher Fremantle  in
London, wrote in a note to investors today.  The brokerage initiated its share price estimate at 3.3
euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
