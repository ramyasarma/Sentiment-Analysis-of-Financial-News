TGLT SA , an Argentine real-estate
developer, completed the first initial public offering of shares
in Buenos Aires in more than two years.  TGLT sold 24.3 million shares at 9.034 pesos each, raising
a total of 220 million pesos ($55.6 million) in cash, it said in
an e-mailed statement. The company also allocated 23.7 million
new shares to investors in exchange for their stakes in projects
being developed by TGLT.  The offer was “a success,” TGLT Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Federico Weil said earlier today in an e-
mailed response.  Initial price guidance was between 9 pesos and 11.50 pesos
each, according to a prospectus dated Oct. 14. The last IPO in
Argentina was in May 2008, when real-estate developer and
holding company  Consultatio SA  raised about $100 million.  Orders for TGLT’s stock totaled 315 million pesos,
according to the statement. Two thirds of the shares were sold
to foreign investors as global depositary receipts, it said.  The Argentine unit of  Raymond James Financial Inc.  handled
the transaction. TGLT’s shares will begin trading in the Buenos
Aires stock exchange on Nov. 5.  The company’s founders and Brazilian real-estate developer
 PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacioes , which held a
minority stake in TGLT before the offering, retained control of
“almost” 50 percent of the shares, according to the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
