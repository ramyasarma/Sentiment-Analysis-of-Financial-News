National Bank of Pakistan, the
biggest lender by assets, said third-quarter profit rose 11.6
percent after it set aside less cash to cover bad debts.  Net income rose to 3.53 billion rupees ($41.2 million), or
2.63 rupees a share, from 3.17 billion rupees, or 2.35 rupees, a
year earlier, the Karachi-based lender said in a statement to
the stock exchange today. Total income climbed to 11.8 billion
rupees from 9.87 billion rupees.   The bank’s provisions for loan defaults and write-offs on
bad debts fell to 1.71 billion rupees in the third quarter from
3.56 billion rupees a year ago, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
