Sugar rose to the highest price
since early February in New York after production plunged in
Brazil, the world’s biggest grower. Coffee increased, while
cocoa fell.  Sugar  output  in Brazil’s Center South, the country’s
biggest producing-region, tumbled 30 percent in the first half
of October from a year earlier, industry association Unica said
yesterday. Prices surged 24 percent in October, the biggest
monthly gain since August 2009, as adverse weather damaged crops
in Brazil, China and Russia.  “People are worried about falling supplies from Brazil,”
said  George Kopp , a senior market analyst at International
Futures Group in Chicago.  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.41 cent, or 1.4
percent, to settle at 29.12 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the commodity touched 29.8
cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since Feb.
2. The price has rallied 8.1 percent this year.  Output in Brazil’s Center South declined to 1.5 million
metric tons in the Oct. 1-Oct. 15 period, from about 2.16
million a year earlier, Unica said.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery fell
$5.30, or 0.7 percent, to $724 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Coffee Jumps  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery advanced 6.85
cents, or 3.5 percent, to $2.0345 a pound in New York. The price
climbed 11 percent this month and has advanced 50 percent in
2010.  On NYSE Liffe in London, robusta-coffee futures for January
delivery rose $56, or 2.9 percent, to $1,970 a ton. Prices
jumped 14 percent this month.  India’s harvest may begin in mid-November, about three
weeks later than normal, said  Ramesh Rajah , the president of the
Coffee Exporters Association of India. The country produces both
arabica and robusta beans.  “Coffee prices may continue to climb until weather
concerns ease in Brazil and Vietnam,” said Rajah, who on Aug.
24 correctly predicted a 10 percent gain in prices. India’s
“harvest has got delayed, but the good news is that the crop is
in excellent condition,” he said yesterday.  Robusta beans are harvested mostly in Asia and parts of
Africa, while arabica coffee is grown mainly in Latin America
and brewed by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp.  Cocoa Declines  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell $48, or 1.7
percent, to $2,797 a ton on ICE. Earlier, the contract touched
$2,780, the lowest level since Oct. 21. Prices have declined 15
percent this year.  Cocoa fell after ABN Amro and VM Group said output in Ivory
Coast, the world’s largest grower, will increase in the year
that began Oct. 1.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery declined 16
pounds, or 0.9 percent, to 1,856 pounds ($2,973) a ton. The
commodity had its fourth straight monthly loss, the longest
streak of declines since May 2003.  To contact the reporters on this story:
