Merck & Co. , the second-largest U.S.
drugmaker, reported third-quarter profit that rose more than
analysts estimated as reduced costs helped overcome revenue
losses from drugs facing generic competition.  Earnings, excluding a $950 million legal reserve for a
Vioxx lawsuit and other one-time items, were 85 cents a share,
beating by 2 cents the  average estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Net income  fell 90 percent to $342 million from
acquisition costs and charges, the Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based company said today in a statement.  Sales jumped 84 percent to $11.1 billion after adding
products from its $49.6 billion acquisition of Schering-Plough
Corp. last November. Merck said today that it’s on track to cut
15,000 jobs from its combined workforce and close facilities to
save $3.5 billion in annual costs by 2012.  “Focus on cost control is working,” said  Marc Goodman , an
analyst at UBS Securities LLC, in a note to clients today. “We
continue to see this as a cost-cutting story ahead of major
pipeline events and think management is doing a good job.”  Merck raised the lower end of its 2010 earnings forecast to
$3.31 to $3.39 a share, excluding one-time items. The company
previously said it anticipated profit of $3.29 to $3.39.  The company fell 63 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $36.31 at
4:01 p.m. in  New York Stock Exchange  composite trading. The
stock had gained 15 percent in the 12 months before today.  Cozaar, Hyzaar  Merck’s $950 million legal reserve was set aside for the
anticipated resolution of an investigation by the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts. The case
was previously disclosed, and talks with the government
continue, Merck said today.  Merck withdrew Vioxx in 2004 after a study showed it
doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The company won
11 of 16 Vioxx lawsuits at trial before agreeing in 2007 to
create a $4.85 billion settlement fund to resolve thousands of
injury claims over the drug. Plaintiffs’ lawsuits contended
Merck managers distorted the drug’s health risks.  “We’d be buyers on any significant weakness today from the
$950 million legal reserve related to Vioxx,” said  Seamus Fernandez , an analyst with Leerink Swann & Co., in a note to
clients. The “legal charge overshadows solid product
performance.”  Merck lost exclusive rights this year to blood-pressure
pills,  Cozaar and Hyzaar , with combined 2009 sales of $3.6
billion. Sales of the two drugs declined to $423 million, from
$861 million in the third quarter of last year. That compares
with $387 million, the average estimate of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Diabetes Franchise  Sales of Merck’s diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet
increased 28 percent to $847 million. Januvia stimulates the
pancreas to produce more insulin and signals the liver to make
less blood sugar. The medicine doesn’t have side effects linked
to other types of diabetes medicines, studies suggest.  Sales of the HIV treatment Isentress increased 41 percent
to $278 million. Isentress is the first in a new class of AIDS
medicines that attack HIV by blocking an enzyme used to hijack
healthy immune cells.  Sales of Merck’s Gardasil vaccine rose 1.6 percent to $316
million, the company said. Gardasil, approved in 2006 to prevent
cervical cancer in females ages 9 to 26, hasn’t been embraced by
older women within that age group.  Merck received marketing approval for three products in the
third quarter: approval of Dulera for asthma in the U.S.;
Brinavess for irregular heartbeats in the European Union,
Iceland and Norway; and Daxas for obstructive lung disease in
Canada and certain European markets.  About 18 percent of sales from human drugs and vaccines
came from emerging markets in the third quarter. Merck has been
shifting focus to outside the U.S. and Europe where there are
less pricing pressures from governments and health insurers.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
