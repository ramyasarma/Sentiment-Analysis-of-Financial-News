The spot price of emission credits
in New Zealand’s carbon market fell this week amid small trading
volumes caused by a lack of supply, Auckland-based broker
OMFinancial Ltd. said.  Carbon credits dropped to NZ$19.80 ($14.95) a metric ton
from NZ$20.05 a week earlier, the broker said in an e-mailed
statement today. Companies in New Zealand that emit greenhouse
gases have the option to pay a tax of NZ$25 a ton of emissions
or buy carbon credits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
