Estonian  industrial production  
increased in September at the fastest annual pace in at least a 
decade, as exports improved and domestic demand rose.  Production increased 31.1 percent from a year earlier, the
most since records began in 2000, compared with a revised 21.7
percent the previous month, the Tallinn-based statistics office
said today on its  website . Output rose 3.6 percent from the
previous month, on a seasonally adjusted basis.  Industrial output has improved following the biggest plunge
in the 27-member European Union last year as demand for Estonia
goods increases in the country’s key Nordic trading partners,
Finland and Sweden. An export-led recovery will help Estonia’s
economy expand 2.5 percent this year and 4.2 percent in 2011,
the central bank forecast last month.  Export sales of manufactured goods jumped 54 percent from a
year earlier, compared with a 41 percent increase in August.
Domestic sales increased 7 percent, compared with a 3 percent
rise the previous month, the office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
