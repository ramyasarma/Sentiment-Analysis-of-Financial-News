Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  denied that his office intervened to secure the
release of an underage girl from police custody in Milan.  “I don’t believe that anything was done through Palazzo
Chigi,” Berlusconi, referring to his office, said in comments
to journalists late yesterday in Brussels broadcast today on  Sky
Italia  television. “There was just a call made to find someone
to take custody of a person that we all felt sorry for because
she had told everyone a dramatic story that we gave credit to.”  Newspapers including  Corriere della Sera  and la Repubblica,
citing court documents, have said Berlusconi’s office intervened
in May to get the 17-year-old freed from police custody after
she was detained on suspicion of theft and turned over to his
former dental hygienist, who is now a regional official for
Berlusconi’s political party. The young woman later told police
that she was paid to attend parties at one of Berlusconi’s Milan
homes with other young women, who engaged in sexual “games”
with the premier.  Berlusconi yesterday called the stories about the alleged
sexual exploits “media trash.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
