Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd.,
India’s biggest power-equipment maker, posted a 33 percent
increase in second-quarter profit, beating estimates, as orders
rose on demand from utilities.  Net income  in the three months ended Sept. 30 climbed to
11.4 billion rupees ($256 million) from 8.58 billion rupees a
year earlier, the company said in a statement to the Bombay
Stock Exchange today. The average estimate of 24 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was a profit of  10.4 billion rupees .  India plans to boost generation capacity to reduce
blackouts and drive the world’s third-fastest growing major
economy. The state-owned company faces increasing competition
from rivals in China, which are seeking orders overseas as
growth in their domestic market slows.  Bharat Heavy  shares  gained 1.4 percent to 2,481.10 rupees
at 10:55 a.m. in Mumbai trading. The stock has climbed 3 percent
this year compared with a 14 percent increase in the benchmark
 Sensitive Index .  The equipment maker had 1.54 trillion rupees of orders in
hand, according to the statement. That compares with 1.26
trillion rupees of orders a year earlier. Sales rose 26 percent
to 83.3 billion rupees.  India’s installed power generation capacity was  164,835 
megawatts as of Sept. 30, according to the  Central Electricity
Authority . The government aims to expand capacity to 286,756
megawatts by March 2017, according to the  Planning Commission .  Shanghai Electric Group Co. signed a $10 billion contract
with Reliance Power Ltd. yesterday to supply 42 units of 660
megawatts each. Chinese power-equipment suppliers are competing
for orders overseas because of government steps to cut carbon
emissions locally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
