Zong Qinghou , chairman of drinks
maker  Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. , topped Forbes Asia’s China rich
list for 2010 with an estimated net worth of $8 billion.  Robin Li , co-founder of Internet search engine  Baidu Inc .,
was ranked second with $7.2 billion.  Wang Chuanfu , chairman of
 Warren Buffett -backed automaker  BYD Co.  and last year’s richest
individual, fell to tenth place on the 2010 list with $4.25
billion, according to an e-mailed statement.  The number of billionaires in China rose more than 60
percent from last year to 128 as the nation’s  economy  recovered
from the global financial crisis and more entrepreneurs listed
their businesses. Former journalist  Wu Yajun  became the eighth
richest Chinese on this year’s list and its wealthiest woman,
after her  Longfor Properties Co.  raised HK$6.7 billion in a Hong
Kong initial public offering in November.  Sany Heavy Industry Co.  Chairman  Wengen Liang , with $5.9
billion, was ranked the third-richest individual on the Forbes
list.  Zhang Jindong , chairman of retailer  Suning Appliance Co. ,
was fourth with $5.7 billion and  Shenzhen Hepalink
Pharmaceutical Co.  Chairman Li Li was fifth with $5.4 billion.
Nine of the 128 people with more than $1 billion were younger
than 40 and 11 of them are women, according to Forbes.  Wahaha’s Zong was also last month named China’s richest man
by the  Hurun Rich List , which estimated his wealth at $12
billion. Zong founded Wahaha, which means “laughing child” in
Chinese, in 1987. He built the company, formerly the sales
department in a school-run business in the eastern Chinese city
of Hangzhou, into a nationwide food and beverage maker with 30
billion yuan ($4.5 billion) in assets and 30,000 employees,
according to the company’s website.  Hepalink ’s Li and his family were ranked second on the
Hurun list with an estimated $6 billion. The drugmaker began
 trading  in Shenzhen in May after raising 5.9 billion yuan in its
initial public offering.  -- Zhang Dingmin . Editors: John Liu, Frank Longid  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
