Empresas Iansa SA , the Chilean sugar
producer, rose for a ninth day after BCI Corredor de Bolsa
initiated coverage with an “overweight” rating, citing efforts
to focus on its core production business and price prospects for
the sweetener.  Iansa  rose 2.1 percent to 55.5 pesos at 10:58 a.m. New York
time. The stock has increased 23 percent during October.  BCI forecasts Iansa will rise to 64 pesos per share by
year-end 2011, bolstered by efficiency gains from its “Plan
Dulce” strategic plan, synergies from the integration of assets
of ED&F Man Chile and high sugar prices for the coming years,
 Rodrigo Mujica , an analyst at BCI Corredor de Bolsa, wrote in an
e-mailed note to clients.  “Iansa’s results in 2010 should improve significantly
compared to previous years,” Mujica wrote. “Lower production
in past years affected profitability, while in the first half of
the year revenues grew 54.3 percent. The company may post record
results in 2010.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
