Acer Inc. estimates that China has
overtaken the U.S. as the world’s largest buyer of computers by
shipment, as the U.S market slows, Chief Executive
Officer Gianfranco Lanci said at a briefing today in Taipei.  Canibalization of computer sales from tablet PCs is limited
mostly to the U.S., Lanci said.  Acer is confident its operating margin will reach 3 percent
for the year, Chief Financial Officer Tu Che-min said at the
same briefing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
