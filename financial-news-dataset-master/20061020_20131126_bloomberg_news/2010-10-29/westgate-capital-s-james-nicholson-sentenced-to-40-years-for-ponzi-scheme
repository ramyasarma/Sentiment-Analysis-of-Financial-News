Westgate Capital Management LLC
founder  James Nicholson  was sentenced to 40 years in prison
after pleading guilty to defrauding investors in a Ponzi scheme.  U.S. District Judge  Richard J. Sullivan  imposed the
sentence at a hearing today in Manhattan. The government had
requested a term of 45 years; Nicholson’s lawyers asked Sullivan
to sentence him to 10 years.  Prosecutors claimed Nicholson’s fraud cost investors
$141 million. Defense lawyers claimed in court papers that
investors lost no more than $50 million.  Nicholson, 44, of Saddle River, New Jersey, admitted he
lied to investors about stock trades, the returns on his
investments and the amount he had under management. He said he
controlled $50 million to $60 million, while telling investors
he had $900 million under management, prosecutors said.  The case is U.S. v. Nicholson, 09-cr-414, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
