Hero Honda Motors Ltd. , India’s
biggest motorcycle maker, posted its biggest drop in quarterly
profit in three years as higher raw-material costs eroded gains
from increased sales.  Net income  fell 15 percent to 5.06 billion rupees ($114
million), or 25.32 rupees a share, in the three months ended
Sept.30 from 5.97 billion rupees, or 29.9 rupees, a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today. That was lower
than the 5.6 billion-rupee average  profit estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of 29 analysts. Sales grew 12 percent to 45.1
billion rupees.  Hero Honda’s spending on steel, rubber and other raw
materials rose 22 percent in the quarter. The price of the
benchmark hot-rolled steel, used in making cars and motorcycles,
rose 18 percent in the second quarter to $668 a metric ton
compared to $565 per ton a year ago, according to Steel Business
Briefing.  Hero Honda,  part-owned  by Honda Motor Co., fell 2.2 percent
to 1,865.25 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of trading in Mumbai.
The stock has risen 13 percent this year. The earnings were
announced after trading hours.  Hero Honda’s sales of  Splendor  and other models rose 8.5
percent in the last quarter as economic growth and stock-market
gains boosted consumer spending in the world’s second-most
populous country. The New Delhi-based company plans to expand
annual capacity about 9 percent this year to more than 5 million
motorcycles and scooters to meet the rising demand.  Honda , Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, is in talks to sell
part of its 26 percent stake in  Hero Honda , according to five
people with direct knowledge of the situation. KKR & Co., TPG
Capital, Carlyle Group and Bain Capital LLC are competing to
acquire a part of the stake, while the Hero Group’s Munjal
family may also buy some, the people said last month.  Honda’s stake in Hero Honda is worth about $2.2 billion,
according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
