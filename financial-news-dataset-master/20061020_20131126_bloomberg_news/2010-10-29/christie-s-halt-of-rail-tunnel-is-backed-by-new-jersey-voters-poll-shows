More than half of  New Jersey  voters
back Governor  Chris Christie ’s decision to kill the largest U.S.
mass-transit project, a proposed commuter rail tunnel linking
his state to Manhattan, a Rutgers University poll showed.  Fifty-one percent of registered voters said they support
the decision, while 39 percent said they disagreed with it,
according to the  Rutgers-Eagleton Poll  released today. Among
residents who commute to New York City, 52 percent said they
disagreed with the decision.  Christie, a first-term Republican, ended construction on
the project Oct. 27 after he said the state couldn’t afford as
much as $5 billion in cost overruns he said may occur. The tube,
which was to end at a new station on New York’s 34th Street, was
originally slated to cost $8.7 billion and create as many as
60,000 jobs during construction.  “Across the state, voters applaud the governor’s
decision,”  David Redlawsk , director of the poll and professor
of political science at the university, said in a statement.
“While those who regularly travel to New York feel differently,
much of the state agrees with Christie that the project is too
expensive.”  Among Republicans, 71 percent said they supported
Christie’s decision, compared with 32 percent of Democrats who
did. The governor, 48, is the first Republican to win a
statewide election since 1997.  Researchers at New Brunswick-based Rutgers-Eagleton Poll
surveyed 885 registered voters from Oct. 21-27. It has a margin
of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
