Poland’s 2011 budget and fiscal plan
for the next four years don’t ensure “sustained financial
stability” and may breach a ceiling that would trigger
automatic spending cuts, the central bank said.  There is “a serious risk” Poland’s public debt will
exceed a 55 percent threshold of gross domestic product
enshrined in the country’s constitution, the  central bank  said
in an opinion released today.  “Potential zloty depreciation, lower-than-assumed economic
growth, as well as lower-than-targeted revenue from state asset
sales may threaten the 55 percent threshold,” the bank said in
the opinion, which was sent to the government and parliament
today.  Poland’s constitution requires the government to push
through spending cuts if the deficit exceeds the debt threshold,
even if the measures come at the expense of  economic growth . The
government is also struggling to bring its deficit in line with
the European Union’s 3 percent limit in order to be released
from the bloc’s excessive deficit procedure.  The budget plan assumes the deficit will narrow to about
6.5 percent of GDP in 2011 from an estimated 7.9 percent this
year.  Poland’s public debt, as defined by EU accounting standards,
will swell to 55.4 percent of GDP this year from 50.9 percent at
the end of 2009, the Warsaw-based Finance Ministry said in an
Oct. 22 statement. The debt will hover near the 55 percent limit
through the next three years, according to the fiscal plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
