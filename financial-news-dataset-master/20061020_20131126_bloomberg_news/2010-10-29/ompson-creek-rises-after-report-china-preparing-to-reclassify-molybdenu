Thompson Creek Metals Co. , the
operator of two molybdenum mines in North America, rose the most
in 17 months after a report that China is preparing to classify
the metal as a so-called national mining resource.  The move by China would limit the mining of the metal
starting next year, the China Securities Journal reported today,
citing an unidentified person. Molybdenum is used in
steelmaking.  China this year curbed exports of rare-earth metals, a
group of metallic elements used in petroleum refining, fiber-
optic transmission, and military radar and missile-guidance
systems. Rare-earth prices jumped following the move.  Thompson Creek  gained  C$1.71, or 16 percent, to C$12.67 as
of 10:48 a.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The shares
earlier climbed as much as 16 percent, the biggest intraday
increase since May 19, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
