German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
that the European Union will act as an “economic government”
in future.  Speaking to reporters in Brussels today after EU leaders
agreed to set up a permanent debt-crisis mechanism, Merkel
hailed the “important decision” taken and said that the EU
will monitor member states’ competitiveness.  The EU must add the detail to the crisis mechanism agreed
upon by December, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
