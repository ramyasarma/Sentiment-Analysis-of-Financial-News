Gold gained in New York as a drop in
prices prompted physical buyers to increase purchases of the
metal. Palladium climbed to a nine-year high.  Gold earlier today declined as the dollar gained against
the euro, while holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products
slid for a 10th day yesterday, Bloomberg data show. Bullion
futures, which usually move inversely to the U.S. currency,
reached a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  “We continue to expect gold physical demand to prevail on
dips,” said  Walter de Wet , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in
London. “We believe the buying interest is an indication that
the physical gold market is slowly adjusting to the higher gold
price.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $6.50, or 0.5
percent, to $1,349.10 an ounce at 8:26 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices earlier fell 0.5 percent and are up 3.2 percent in
October, heading for a third monthly gain. The metal for
immediate delivery in London was 0.5 percent higher at
$1,350.72. Spot prices reached an all-time high $1,387.35 on
Oct. 14.  Gold, up 23 percent this year, is heading for a 10th annual
gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in London.
Bullion has outperformed global equities, Treasuries and most
industrial metals, prompting record investment in gold-backed
exchange-traded products. Concern about possible further
monetary easing in the U.S. has supported prices this month.  Fed Meeting  Federal Reserve policy makers meet next on Nov. 2-3.
Estimates for the size of the Fed’s asset-purchase program range
from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch to $2 trillion
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Economists at both firms agree the
Fed may start by announcing a $500 billion plan.  Prices may be supported by increased jewelry demand in
India because of the Diwali religious festival next week, aided
by a “favorable” monsoon and high food prices, said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago. The
country is the world’s biggest bullion consumer.  “The positive argument will lie in Indian demand,”
Pawlicki said. “Farmers should be flush with cash and able to
take advantage of the recent drop in gold prices.”  Gold assets in  ETPs  dropped 5.69 metric tons to 2,089.46
tons yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10
providers. Holdings are up 16 percent this year and reached a
record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.  Silver for December delivery in New York added 1.3 percent
to $24.185 an ounce. Platinum for January delivery gained 0.7
percent to $1,704.50 an ounce. Palladium for December delivery
climbed as much as 2.2 to a nine-year high of $643.55 an ounce
and was last at $641.75.  To contact the reporters on this story:
