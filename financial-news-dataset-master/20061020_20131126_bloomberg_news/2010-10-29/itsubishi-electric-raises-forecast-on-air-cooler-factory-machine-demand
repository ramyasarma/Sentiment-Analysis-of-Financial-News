Mitsubishi Electric Corp.  raised its
full-year profit forecast by 28 percent citing better-than-
expected sales of air conditioners and factory equipment.  Net income will probably be 115 billion yen ($1.4 billion)
in the 12 months through March 2011, the Japanese maker of
machinery and home appliances said today in a statement. The
average  forecast  of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for profit of 103.1 billion yen.  Sales in the company’s home-appliance division surged 14
percent last quarter as a summer heat wave boosted demand for
air conditioners, while revenue from factory equipment climbed
31 percent. Orders for Japanese machine tools have risen for 10
months as manufacturers expand and replace worn-out equipment,
according to the  Japan Machine Tool Builders Association .  Shares  of the Tokyo-based industrial group rose 3.3 percent
to 755 yen at 1:47 p.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange following
the announcement. The benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  slipped
1.6 percent. Mitsubishi Electric has risen 10 percent this year
on expectation the economic recovery will boost demand for
machinery.  To contact the reporters on this story:
