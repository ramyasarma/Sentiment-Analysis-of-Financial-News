U.S. stock index futures erased
losses as the government reported the economy grew at a 2
percent rate last quarter, reinforcing speculation that the
Federal Reserve will pump more cash into financial markets to
stimulate the recovery.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December lost less than 0.1 percent to 1,178.3 at 8:57 a.m. in
New York after sliding 0.6 percent earlier. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures slipped 1 point, or less than 0.1 percent, to
11,048.  “It’s slow growth at best,” said Richard Sichel, who
oversees $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co. “There’s no surprise in the GDP figures.
Consumer spending is growing, but not as much as we would like.
It seems that unemployment will stay high for the foreseeable
future. That most likely calls for further QE next week.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
