Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. , the
world’s largest contract manufacturer of electronics, had a 15
percent increase in third-quarter profit as rising sales of
Apple Inc. iPhones and Dell Inc. computers offset higher wages.  Net income  rose to NT$21 billion ($685 million) in the
three months to Sept. 30, from NT$18.3 billion a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on nine-month earnings
filed to the exchange today. The average of 10 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of NT$21.5 billion.  Hon Hai, flagship of the Foxconn Technology Group which
counts Apple and  Dell  among its clients, raised wages in China
and began migrating plants inland to tackle labor problems that
resulted in a spate of suicides earlier in the year. Profit
margins may improve from this quarter as clients accept higher
manufacturing costs, according to Citigroup Inc.  “Hon Hai managed to get price hikes from clients because
its chairman,  Terry Gou , is giving senior management lower
revenue targets, which allows them to demand price hikes without
worrying about revenue targets,”  Kevin Chang , who rates Hon Hai
“buy” at Citigroup in Taipei, wrote in an Oct. 8 report.  Hon Hai shares lost 0.4 percent to NT$116 at the 1:30 p.m.
close of trade in Taipei before the announcement. The stock has
lost 14 percent this year, lagging behind a 1.2 percent advance
in the benchmark  Taiex  index.  Growth Target  Gou, the 60-year-old founder of Foxconn, halved the annual
revenue growth target to 15 percent, from the 30 percent in
place for more than a decade, he said in a Sept. 4 interview.  Hon Hai’s unconsolidated sales climbed 72 percent to NT$664
billion, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
subtracting six-month earnings from the nine-month data.  Net income for the nine months to Sept. 30 climbed 19
percent to NT$55.7 billion, on a 63 percent increase in
unconsolidated sales to NT$1.59 trillion, it said.  Apple, which contracts Foxconn to make its iPhone 4 and
iPad, sold 14.1 million handsets during the September quarter,
better than the 11 million estimated by Piper Jaffray Cos.
analyst  Gene Munster . IPad shipments at 4.19 million units were
lower than Munster’s 4.5 million estimate.  Dell, whose desktops and servers are made by Foxconn in
China and Mexico, on Aug. 19 forecast sales of at least $15.7
billion for the quarter ending October, compared with the $15.5
billion average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Foxconn doubled wages for its production workers in
Shenzhen, the southern Chinese region that hosts its largest
factories. Base salaries were increased 30 percent to 1,200 yuan
($180) in June and to 2,000 yuan from Oct. 1, as part of plans
to reduce employees’ overtime hours.  Inland China  At least 10 workers committed suicide earlier this year,
prompting labor groups including China Labor Watch to accuse the
company of running a sweatshop that pushes employees to work
long hours to earn more money. Foxconn has denied the charges.  To reduce its workforce in Shenzhen, where wages are
higher, and locate factories closer to the hometowns of its
workers, Foxconn is boosting investment in inland China.  On Oct. 19 Hon Hai announced more than $350 million of new
China investments, including $80 million for a tablet computer
factory in Chengdu, and at least $50 million for a computer
chassis plant in Huizhou.  To contact the reporter on this story:
