Red Electrica Corp. SA , the manager
of Spain’s power grid, said third-quarter profit rose 16 percent
after it invested in the network and started more assets.  Net income  gained to 88.3 million euros ($122 million) from
75.9 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company said
today. Sales advanced 11 percent to 329 million euros.  Red Electrica, which earns a fixed return on investments to
operate and maintain the high-voltage grid, plans to spend 4
billion euros on network improvements through 2014. Power demand
in Spain has revived after a 4.6 percent slump in 2009.  Investment in the first nine months of the year totaled
1.53 billion euros, up from 439 million euros in the same period
last year, Red Electrica said.  Net debt  rose to 4.31 billion
euros in September from 3.12 billion euros in December.  Since July 1, Red Electrica has announced the purchase of
Spanish electricity transportation assets from utilities EDP-
Energias de Portugal SA, Gas Natural SDG SA and  Endesa SA .  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 13 percent to 691 million euros in the first
nine months of the year. Red Electrica on Feb. 25 said it aims
to post average annual growth in earnings per share of more than
12 percent through 2014.  The company’s shares fell 0.4 percent to 36 euros as of
10:16 a.m. in Madrid.  Red Electrica  has dropped 7.3 percent this
year, valuing the company at 4.9 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
