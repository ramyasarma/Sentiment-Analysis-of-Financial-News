Austrian stage director  Martin Kusej 
was last week forced to drop plans to skin a dead deer on stage
in Munich after animal-rights groups complained and the local
Abendzeitung newspaper ran outraged headlines.  For the  Bayerische Staatsoper  production of Antonin
Dvorak’s “Rusalka,” which premiered on Oct. 23, the opera
ordered deer corpses from a butcher. The Munich Abendzeitung
quoted the president of the Bavarian Animal Protection
Association as saying the plan was “an absolute impudence.”  The opera house responded that “not one animal was killed
on the orders of the Bayerische Staatsoper,” adding “there is
no question of a violation of animal protection laws.”  “Rusalka” tells the story of a water nymph who yearns to
become human so that she can capture the love of a prince. Kusej
was booed as he took his bow at the premiere, though his
production received warm reviews.  Kusej’s staging places the fairytale in the context of
recent abuse and incest cases in his home country, where girls
were kept captive in cellars in Amstetten and Vienna for years
by their male kidnappers.  The performances on Oct. 31 and Nov. 4, the last this year,
have sold out.  To contact the writer on the story:
