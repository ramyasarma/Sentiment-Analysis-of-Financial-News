China Merchants Bank Co. , the
nation’s sixth-largest lender, said profit rose 53.3 percent in
the third quarter on rising income from loans and fee-based
services such as credit cards.  Net income climbed to 7.38 billion yuan ($1.1 billion), or
0.34 yuan a share, from 4.82 billion yuan, or 0.25 yuan a share,
a year earlier, the Shenzhen-based company said in a statement
to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  Merchants Bank expanded lending by 16.5 percent from the
beginning of the year to 1.38 trillion yuan as of Sept. 30. The
outstanding amount of non-performing loans dropped 908 million
yuan in the first nine months to 8.8 billion yuan at the end of
September, today’s statement said.  Merchants Bank dropped 0.9 percent to close at HK$22 in
Hong Kong before today’s earnings announcement. The  stock  has
gained 15 percent this year, outperforming the 5.6 percent gain
in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  -- Luo Jun . Editors: Andreea Papuc  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
