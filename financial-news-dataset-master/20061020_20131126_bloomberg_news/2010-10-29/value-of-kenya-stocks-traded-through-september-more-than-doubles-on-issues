The value of shares traded on the
 Nairobi Stock Exchange , Africa’s second best-performing market
in 2010, more than doubled in the first nine months of this year
from a year earlier, Second Vice Chairman Job Kihumba said.  About 85 billion shillings ($1.1 billion) were traded on
East Africa’s biggest bourse in the period, compared with 38
billion shillings a year ago, Kihumba told reporters today in
Nairobi, the capital. The value of bonds traded increased to
420.8 billion shillings from 110.6 billion shillings.  “Owing to the successful equity transactions that have
taken place this year, 2010 has been dubbed the year of the
rights issues,” Kihumba said. “Out of a total of 28 billion
shillings raised since 1989, 16 billion shillings, or 56 percent
was raised in 2010 alone.”  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. ,  TPS Eastern Africa Ltd.  and
 Standard Chartered Bank of Kenya Ltd.  are among companies that
have had rights offers this year. Kenya Power and Lighting Co.
yesterday announced its 20-for-51 offer will open on Nov. 25.  The 55-member Nairobi Stock Exchange  All-Share Index 
snapped three days of losses, rising 2.2 percent to 84.21 by
12:41 p.m. That extended the measure’s gain this year to 45
percent, the second-best performing gauge in Africa this year
after  Uganda’s , which has increased 63 percent.  The jump in the value of bonds traded “can be attributed
to the introduction of an automated trading system for these
securities,” Kihumba said. Automated bond trading began in
November 2009, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
