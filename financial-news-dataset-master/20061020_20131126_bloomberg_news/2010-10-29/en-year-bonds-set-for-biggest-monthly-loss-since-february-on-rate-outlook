India’s  10-year bonds  are poised for
the biggest monthly loss since February as investors brace for a
possible sixth interest-rate increase by the  central bank  this
year.  Yields touched a two-year high this month, as a cash
shortage at banks pushed up overnight rates, making it more
expensive to buy debt with borrowed funds. Lenders  borrowed  an
average of 574.7 billion rupees ($12.9 billion) a day from the
central bank’s repurchase auction window in October, compared
with an average of 250.8 billion rupees a day in September,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “One more round of interest-rate increase is in the offing
next week,” said Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer at FirstRand
Ltd. in Mumbai. “Persistently tight liquidity is also keeping
the yields higher.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 rose 27
basis points this month to 8.12 percent as of 9:38 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price fell 1.77, or 1.77 rupees per 100 rupees face amount, to
97.88.  The  Reserve Bank  may increase the repurchase auction rate,
at which it lends to banks, for the sixth time this year, 14 of
20 economists said in a Bloomberg News survey before the policy
review on Nov. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
