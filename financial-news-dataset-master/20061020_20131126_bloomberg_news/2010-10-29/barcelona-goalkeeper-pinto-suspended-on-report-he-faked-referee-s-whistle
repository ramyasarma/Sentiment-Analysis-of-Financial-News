Barcelona goalkeeper Jose Manuel
Pinto was suspended for two games amid reports he faked the
sound of the referee’s whistle in a Champions League match to
confuse a Copenhagen striker.  The Spanish team said on its website today it will appeal
the ban by  European ruling body UEFA .  Copenhagen’s Cesar Santin stopped in the middle of leading
an attack during last week’s game because he thought he’d been
called offside, Barcelona said.  According to  El Mundo Deportivo  newspaper, Pinto imitated
the referee’s whistle -- a trick he’s known for employing in
training matches -- and then smiled at his teammates on the
substitutes’ bench.  Barcelona beat Copenhagen 2-0 in the match. Pinto was
standing in for regular goalkeeper  Victor Valdes .  To contact the reporter on this story:
