Crude oil fell as the dollar rose
against the euro, reducing the appeal of raw materials as an
alternative investment.  Futures dropped 0.9 percent as the U.S. currency increased
on concern that Europe’s debt crisis may resurface. Confidence
among U.S. consumers fell in October to the lowest level in
almost a year, which may temper consumer spending, the biggest
part of the economy.  “As long as the dollar keeps gaining, it’s going to keep
pressure on the price of oil,” said  Carl Larry , president of
Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  Crude oil for December delivery fell 75 cents to settle at
$81.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are
up 2 percent from a year ago and 1.8 percent for the month.  Brent crude oil for December settlement dropped 44 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $83.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The dollar climbed 0.2 percent to $1.3899 against the 16-
nation euro amid European Union discussions on a permanent
mechanism to deal with nations facing default.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.1 percent to
1,183.01 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 14.76 points
to 11,099.19.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment decreased to 67.7 from 68.2 in September.
Economists had forecast a reading of 68, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Fed Meeting  The U.S. Federal Reserve meets Nov. 2 and Nov. 3 to
consider steps to boost the economy and to prevent inflation,
which remains below its longer-term projections, from cooling
even more.  The Fed may purchase bonds in a strategy known as
quantitative easing, weakening the U.S. currency and boosting
dollar-denominated commodities.  “Oil prices have been getting a lot of support from the
Fed’s possible quantitative easing move, but if the market is
less than impressed with what the Fed has to say next week, oil
could fall pretty hard,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in Chicago.  Crude may decline next week as U.S. stockpiles increase,
threatening to form a glut, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Crude oil supplies  climbed 5.01 million barrels to 366.2
million last week, the biggest gain since July, an Oct. 27
Energy Department report showed. Total petroleum stockpiles, a
combination of oil and fuel  inventories , rose 0.1 percent to
1.13 billion barrels, 3.9 percent higher than in the week ended
May 28.  Economic Forecasts  Crude pared some of its losses after government data showed
U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 2 percent annual rate
in the third quarter as consumer spending climbed the most in
almost four years.  The growth in the economy matched the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and followed a 1.7 percent
gain the prior three months, Commerce Department figures showed
today in Washington.  Household purchases, about 70 percent of the economy, rose
at a 2.6 percent pace, the best quarter of the recovery that
began in June 2009.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’  crude-
oil output rose from an 11-month low in October, led by gains in
Angola and Nigeria, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Production Gain  Production increased 65,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to an
average 29.01 million barrels a day from a revised 28.945
million in September, the lowest level since November, according
to the survey of oil companies, producers and analysts.  Output by members with quotas, all except Iraq, gained
110,000 barrels to 26.66 million a day from a revised 26.55
million. That’s 1.815 million above their target.  Angolan output rose 60,000 barrels to 1.75 million a day
this month from a revised total of 1.69 million for September,
the biggest increase in OPEC. Production in Nigeria climbed
35,000 barrels to 2.05 million.  Nigeria, a favored supplier of oil to U.S. refiners, plans
to increase daily exports of its 17 biggest crude grades by
about 2.2 percent in December, preliminary loading plans show.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 437,404 contracts as of 2:35
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 500,211
contracts yesterday, 28 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.41 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
