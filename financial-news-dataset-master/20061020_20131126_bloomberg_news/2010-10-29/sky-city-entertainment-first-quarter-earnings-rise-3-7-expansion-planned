Sky City Entertainment Group Ltd. ,
New Zealand’s largest casino operator, said first-quarter
earnings rose 3.7 percent after revenues from most of its
businesses grew.  Normalized profit, excluding cinema operations and adjusted
for non-recurring items, gained 5 percent in the three months
ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier, the Auckland-based company
said in a statement today. Revenue from its largest venue,
Auckland, fell from the year-earlier quarter, it said, without
providing figures.  The company will add three private gaming salons, a rooftop
bar and restaurant to the Auckland center, the company said. The
expansion will cost about NZ$27 million ($20 million) and will
be completed in time for the Rugby World Cup in September, it
said.  Analysts forecast full-year normalized profit after tax
will reach NZ$127.4 million in 2011, the company said. “We
would be disappointed if we did not achieve this,” Chief
Executive Officer  Nigel Morrison  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter for this story:
