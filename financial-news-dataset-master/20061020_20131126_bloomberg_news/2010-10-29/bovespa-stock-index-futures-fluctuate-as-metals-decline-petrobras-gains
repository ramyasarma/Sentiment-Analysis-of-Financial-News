Bovespa  stock-index futures
fluctuated from gains to losses as metals prices fell,
offsetting a gain for  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  on speculation an
offshore oil field may hold up to 16 billion barrels of crude.  Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil company is
known, rose in U.S. trading after the head of the national
petroleum regulator said the Libra field in the Santos Basin off
the coast of southeastern Brazil may have 7.9 billion to 16
billion barrels of oil. Vale SA and other metals producers may
move as prices decline.  Bovespa stock-index futures rose 0.1 percent to 71,350 at
8:27 a.m. New York time, erasing an earlier drop of as much as
0.3 percent. The gauge retreated yesterday as Vale SA fell and
credit-card processors sank after Redecard SA reported earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates. The real slipped 0.1 percent to
1.7054 today.  Haroldo  Lima, the head of the regulator known as the ANP,
said the government owns 100 percent of Libra, according to the
agency’s press office. Oil reserves of 16 billion barrels would
make Libra the biggest find in the Americas since Mexico
discovered Cantarell in 1976. It would be twice as big as
Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s nearby Tupi field, which has estimated
reserves of between 5 billion and 8 billion barrels.  Copper fell in London, paring a fourth monthly gain, as a
stronger dollar eroded demand for industrial metals as an
alternative investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
