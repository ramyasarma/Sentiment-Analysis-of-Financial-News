Groupama SA , a French customer-owned
insurer, agreed to buy a 17 percent stake in the controlling
shareholder of Italian insurance company Fondiaria SAI SpA.  Groupama will acquire the stake in Premafin Finanziaria SpA
through a rights offering, the Italian company said in a
statement distributed by the Milan Stock Exchange. Paris-based
Groupama’s total investment will be 145.7 million euros ($203
million), according to the statement.  Premafin, controlled by Italy’s Ligresti family, is raising
a total of 227.5 million euros through a stock sale, offering
investors 1 new share for every two held. They will offer the
shares at 1.10 euros each.  The funds will help Premafin and Fondiaria “strengthen its
capital,” Premafin said in the statement.  Groupama has agreed not to make bids for Premafin,
Fondiaria and the latter’s insurance unit Milano Assicurazioni
SpA, Premafin said.  Premafin, which was halted this morning pending the news,
resumed trading at 4:30 p.m. in Milan and rose as much as 9.8
percent to 1.09 euros, giving it a market value of 445.2 million
euros. Fondiaria rose as much as 5.6 percent to 8.51 euros in
Milan, boosting its market value to 1.28 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
