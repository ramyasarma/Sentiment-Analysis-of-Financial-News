General Motors Co.  said about 400
workers staged a stoppage over pay at one of its two factories
in India, disrupting production in Asia’s second-fastest growing
major economy.  Management is holding talks with workers at the Halol plant
in western India,  Karl Slym , the managing director for GM’s
local unit, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. The factory
makes 150 vehicles a day, including the Cruze, Aveo and Tavera.  “The workers have stopped work from the first shift this
morning demanding a hike in their wages,” Slym said.  Unions have staged protests to seek higher wages in India
as food inflation that has remained above 10 percent since June,
2009, pushes up living costs. Millions of workers joined
nationwide strikes over rising prices and job losses in July and
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
