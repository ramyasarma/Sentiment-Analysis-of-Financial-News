F&C Asset Management Plc , which
oversees the U.K.’s oldest investment fund, said assets under
management climbed 14 percent in the third quarter as markets
rose and the firm bought hedge fund Thames River Capital Group.  Managed funds increased to 108.2 billion pounds ($172
billion) in the three months to Sept. 30, from 95.3 billion
pounds at June 30, the London-based company said in a statement
today. Net new business inflows were 600 million pounds in
the period.  “The group’s assets under management benefited from a
combination of positive market and currency movements, net
inflows and the acquisition of Thames River during the third
quarter,” Chief Executive Officer  Alain Grisay  said in the
statement.  F&C bought Thames River last month to add hedge funds,
which generate larger fees than the assets managed for insurance
companies that currently make up about one-third of the firm’s
revenue. Sherborne Investors, an activist shareholder, bought a
10 percent stake in the firm earlier this year becoming its
second-largest investor, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Thames River added 4.2 billion pounds to F&C’s assets,
while gains in equity and fixed-income markets increased the
fund manager’s holdings by about 4.8 billion pounds. The
strengthening of the euro against the dollar added 3.3 billion
pounds in the period, F&C said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
