China’s investment in power plants
and grids may fall “slightly” to 660 billion yuan ($99
billion) this year compared with 2009, the China Electricity
Council said.  Power-grid investment will continue to account for less
than 50 percent of total spending, the council said in a
statement on its  website  today. It didn’t give a reason for the
drop in investment.  China’s installed power generation capacity will increase
by about 90,000 megawatts to more than 950,000 megawatts by the
end of this year, according to the council. Thermal-power plants
will account for 74 percent of the total and hydropower capacity
for 22 percent. Nuclear and wind power capacity will make up the
remaining 4 percent.  The country will invest mainly in power plants fueled by
clean energy resources this year, the council said. Renovations
to rural grids will provide scope for further investment, the
council said.  China’s power consumption may reach 4.1 billion megawatt-
hours this year, it said. Coal consumption by power stations may
exceed 1.7 billion metric tons.  Thermal coal stockpiles at the country’s power plants were
at 60.6 million tons at the end of September, enough for 19 days
of consumption, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
