Giochi Preziosi SpA may seek new
investors as an alternative to selling stock in an initial
public offering, weekly Il Mondo reported, without saying where
it got the information.  CVC Capital Partners, Apax Partners LLP and
Investindustrial may be interested in buying a stake,
potentially replacing Clessidra SGR, Intesa Sanpaolo and Idea
Capital, according to the Italian newspaper.  Founder Enrico Preziosi will likely keep his majority
stake, the weekly said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
