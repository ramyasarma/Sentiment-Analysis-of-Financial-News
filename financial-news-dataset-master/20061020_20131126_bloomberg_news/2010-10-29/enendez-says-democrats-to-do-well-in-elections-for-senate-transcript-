U.S. Senator Robert Menendez of New
Jersey, leader of the Democratic Senate campaign, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with Al
Hunt,” airing this weekend, that his party will do better than
expected in the Nov. 2 elections.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome back. Senator Robert Menendez is at our
Bloomberg studios in New York. Thank you for being with us,
senator.  SENATOR ROBERT MENENDEZ: Good to be with you, Al.  HUNT: The eve of the big midterm elections. Mike Allen in
his Playbook says the Republicans will pick up at least eight
Senate seats next Tuesday. What’s your prediction?  MENENDEZ: Well, I believe that we will, number one, be in
the majority in the Senate as Democrats after November 2nd. And
I think that, just like this election cycle has been one of
enormous change and surprises - who would have believed that
Mitch McConnell’s handpicked candidate would have lost in
Kentucky or that several Republican incumbent senators would
have been drummed out of their party, Charlie Crist would have
been drummed out of his party? So I think there are more
surprises, and I think we may very well do better than that.  HUNT: Yeah, we don’t want to go into a lot of individual
races, but there is one that’s especially interesting, Alaska.
Strange race up there. The Republican primary victor Joe Miller
is enmeshed in scandal, dropping polls. Lisa Murkowski, the
incumbent, running as a write-in, hasn’t been done in 56 years.  You represent Atlantic City, where they know something
about probability and odds. What are the odds that Scott
McAdams, the little-known mayor of Sitka, could actually win
that Alaska seat?  MENENDEZ: Well, McAdams is doing an excellent job. And, you
know - you know, the Tea Party candidate has plummeted because
he’s more about an ideological perspective. Lisa Murkowski is
about leadership, Republican leadership in the Senate. McAdams
is all about Alaska. And so I think that’s -  HUNT: So you think he can win?  MENENDEZ:  - going to sell on Election Day.  HUNT: You think McAdams will win?  MENENDEZ: I think he has a real shot of winning. And, you
know, every poll shows that he has risen dramatically. My
colleague from Alaska, you know, the Democratic senator from
Alaska, Mark Begich, thinks he has an excellent opportunity to
win. I think he has a great opportunity to win.  HUNT: We - we have a Bloomberg poll out this morning that
says by 2 to 1 voters think taxes have gone up in the past year,
economy is shrinking, and the government won’t get most of its
money back from rescuing Wall Street banks. In fact, as you
know, taxes have been cut, the government’s going to get that
money back, and the economy is growing.  Isn’t the fact that Americans don’t know any of that an
indictment of the White House?  MENENDEZ: Well, certainly, it is a challenge in these times
to get the messaging to break through, though the realities are
we’ve gotten virtually all of our money back from the bailout,
we see GDP growth -  HUNT: But why do you think the White House has done such a
poor job in conveying that message?  MENENDEZ: Well, you know, what happens is, is that we had
an incredibly aggressive agenda for the first two years of this
administration. And before anything could sink in about what was
being accomplished, we were on to the next issue. And I think
that has created a consequence for us as individuals in our
country not knowing the realities of that - what things were and
how they’ve become so much better.  Still a lot of work to do for a lot of Americans to get a
job, but we’re moving in the right direction. And that’s what
we’ve had our candidates make the contrast in these elections.
That’s why in the midst of midterm election history, which means
the president’s party loses seats, we are going to be in the
majority on Election Day.  HUNT: Senator, do you think the congressional Democratic
leaders made a mistake in not taking up that tax bill in
September, where it’s a non-issue in most campaigns, it’s not
hurting Republicans, and taxes are scheduled to go up for all
Americans in January?  MENENDEZ: Well, I was one of those who advocated having a
vote, because I wanted to show that Democrats stood on the side
of middle-class taxpayers, working people in our country, and
overwhelmingly want to make those tax cuts permanent, not just
temporary in nature, as the Bush tax cuts did. They had a sunset
day. We would have made them permanent in nature for everyone
making a quarter of a million dollars or less.  HUNT: So a mistake in not bringing it up?  MENENDEZ: And so I think it would have been a good
opportunity.  HUNT: Yeah. And how about a lame-duck session, which you’re
going to have? Do you think a tax cut - the tax cut extension
will be enacted then, in what shape?  MENENDEZ: Well, I certainly hope that we do get to the tax
cuts at the end of the year when we have the lame-duck session.
But, Al, the lame-duck session is either going to be rather lame
or it’s going to be a pretty strong one, depending upon how
Republicans view it.  If they win seats and think they’ll be in a better position
in January of next year, they may very well not want to get
anything done. If we look at it as an opportunity to, you know,
after the elections, after the partisanship to move forward,
then there’s some real opportunities. That’s going to depend
upon the Republican view, because, of course, you know, they
have the filibuster opportunity, which they’ve used over 100
times in the last year alone.  HUNT: Senator, Vice President Biden and some others have
complained about Republican money in this campaign, yet the
Center for Responsive Politics says, when you put it all
together, that the Democratic Party committees -yours is doing a
good job, and you take all the outside groups, Democrats are
still outspending Republicans in this campaign. Isn’t - aren’t
you more than holding your own on money?  MENENDEZ: Well, look, the reality is, is that everything
that we spend is fully attributed and transparent and the voters
know where the money comes from. What’s happened is we’ve had
anywhere between $44 million and $46 million just against Senate
Democrats by unknown corporate interests, and they’re not
spending $46 million to be civic-minded.  They’re spending $46 million to promote their special
interests, and whether that’s undoing Wall Street reform or
whether that is about the insurance companies wanting to go back
to denying people arbitrarily and capriciously, or Big Oil
wanting to drill without mitigation, they’re buying an agenda,
and that’s what’s really wrong with this process.  HUNT: OK, Senator Menendez, let me ask you a final
question. When we wake up next Wednesday morning, give me one
surprise, one prediction where the conventional wisdom will have
proven wrong and a Republican will not win a Senate race that
we’re all saying that they’re going to win now.  MENENDEZ: Well, I think you’re - you’ll see it in Illinois,
where Mark Kirk, you know, everybody believes that he can win. I
think Alexi Giannoulias will win that race and will add another
Democratic seat to the victory margin on November 2nd.  HUNT: Okay. Senator Robert Menendez, the chairman of the
Senate campaign committee, thank you very much for being with
us. And when we return, the background, Pennsylvania, we’ll have
Margaret Carlson and Kate O’Beirne’s final prediction, right
after the break.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
