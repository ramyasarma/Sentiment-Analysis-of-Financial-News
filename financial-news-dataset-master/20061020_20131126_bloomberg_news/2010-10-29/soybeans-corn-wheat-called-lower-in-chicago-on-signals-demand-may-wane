What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures are called 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand may ease after prices
climbed yesterday to a 25-month high, said  Paul Beere , a market
adviser at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
Wisconsin. Soybean-meal futures may open $1.50 lower per 2,000
pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open down 0.5 cent a
pound.  -- Corn futures may open 5 cents a bushel lower on signs of
slowing demand for U.S. exports, Beere said.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as demand for the grain used in livestock feed
may wane as corn and soybean prices drop, Beere said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
