U.K. stocks pared earlier losses, as
gains by utilities offset declines by basic-resource companies
and British Airways Plc.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index was little changed at 5,677.83
at 1:54 p.m. in London, after falling as much as 0.5 percent
earlier today. The gauge is heading for a 2.3 percent gain this
month, extending September’s 6.2 percent rally.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
