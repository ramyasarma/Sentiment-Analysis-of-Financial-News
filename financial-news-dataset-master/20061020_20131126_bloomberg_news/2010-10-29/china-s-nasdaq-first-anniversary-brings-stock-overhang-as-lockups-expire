As China’s version of the  Nasdaq
Stock Market  marks its first anniversary tomorrow, many
investors have little reason to celebrate.  An index of 100 companies that trade on Shenzhen-based
 ChiNext , China’s main market for start-ups, has gained 6.7
percent since the gauge was introduced on June 1, trailing the
17 percent advance for the  Shanghai Composite Index . ChiNext’s
companies are still about three times as expensive as the
average Chinese stock relative to earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ChiNext’s  stocks have underperformed on concern that
executives and investors who held shares in the companies before
their initial public offerings will flood the market with equity
as lockup restrictions expire. About 33 billion yuan ($4.9
billion) of ChiNext shares become tradable on Nov. 1, equal to a
quarter of the total  outstanding stock  on the board, according
to  Liu Xiangning , an analyst at Huatai Securities Co.  “Most shares in ChiNext companies are held by venture
capital firms and individual shareholders who got in at
relatively low costs, indicating high incentives to sell,” said
Qian Weihai, an analyst at Shanghai Securities Co. “It’s less
about how much the company is actually worth to them, but more
about cashing in when they can as the profits have become
phenomenal.”  Funding Avenue  Some 59 percent of companies listed on  ChiNext  are backed
by venture capital or private equity firms, compared with 35
percent of stocks traded on China’s six-year-old board for small
and medium-sized businesses in Shenzhen, according to
 ChinaVenture .  Venture capital and private equity investors in ChiNext
companies have made an average return of 13 times based on book
value, or the carrying value of their investments, the research
firm estimates.  ChiNext was created as an alternative exchange for smaller
Chinese companies to raise money with fewer listing requirements
than the nation’s two main boards in  Shanghai  and Shenzhen.
Companies such as Beijing-based Baidu Inc. have gone public on
New York’s Nasdaq Stock Market after they couldn’t meet
requirements of the exchange’s in Shanghai and Shenzhen for
three years of annual profit before listing. ChiNext requires a
two-year profit history.  ‘Strategic’ Industries  ChiNext is helping the nation reduce its reliance on
exports by nurturing local companies in “emerging and
strategic” industries,  Shang Fulin , chairman of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, said today at a forum in
Shenzhen, according to a transcript of the regulator’s remarks
posted to the website of the People’s Daily.  ChiNext IPOs raised $15.1 billion in the board’s first year
of operation. That’s equivalent to almost 80 percent of the
amount raised in first-time sales by U.S. companies in the same
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Chinese companies have
sold $71 billion of shares in domestic IPOs in the past year.  The board accounted for five of the worst-performing IPO
stocks in the past year and three of the biggest gainers,
Bloomberg data show.  That hasn’t stopped investors from flocking to ChiNext IPOs,
allowing companies to sell shares at higher valuations. The
average first-time sale on the board valued stocks at about 66
times earnings, according to Ophelia Tang, an analyst at SooChow
Securities Co. The Shanghai Composite trades at  20 times
earnings , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bosses Depart  “ChiNext is the best tool for the powerful and the rich to
cash in,” said  Xu Xiaonian , a professor at China Europe
International Business School and a former researcher at the
 State Council , China’s cabinet. “It’s most obvious if you look
at all the ChiNext executives resigning soon after the company
they helped found got listed.”  Executives, including general managers, board members and
chief financial officers, at 37 ChiNext companies have quit
since their firms went public, Liu of Huatai Securities wrote in
an Oct. 26 report, citing exchange filings.  Departed managers at 21 of those companies own shares in
their firms valued at a combined 5 billion yuan, Liu estimated.  Under ChiNext listing rules, controlling shareholders are
banned from selling stock within three years of the IPO. Other
pre-IPO investors face a 12-month lockup. Executives typically
pledge not to sell stock within six months of resigning,
according to company filings.  New Billionaires  The creation of ChiNext helped spark a jump in the number
of rich Chinese, said  Rupert Hoogewerf , founder of the Hurun
Report, which compiles an annual list of China’s wealthiest
people.  “This year we’ve found about 400 people with a billion
yuan, many of them coming through listings,” Hoogewerf said in
an interview in Beijing last month. “We’ve seen ChiNext create
a whole lot of new wealth that we didn’t even know existed.”  Local investment banks have benefited too. Fees for ChiNext
IPOs average 5.14 percent, according to Bloomberg data, more
than double those for first-time sales on the main board in
Shanghai. ChiNext offerings have generated 5.17 billion yuan in
total fees, the data show.  Ping An Securities Co. is the biggest underwriter of
ChiNext IPOs, followed by Essence Securities Co. and Guosen
Securities Co., data compiled by Bloomberg show. Credit Suisse
Founder Securities Co. is the top-ranked foreign-backed
underwriter of such deals in 35th place.  Netac Technology Co. , a manufacturer of external hard
drives, is the worst-performing ChiNext stock with a 23 percent
drop from its January IPO. Netac raised 655.2 million yuan in an
offering arranged by PingAn Securities.  “The perception of high-growth ChiNext companies hasn’t
been matched by reality, so investors’ enthusiasm might have
been dampened a bit,” said Tang of Soochow Securities.  -- Eva Woo . Editors:  Philip Lagerkranser ,  John Liu   To contact the reporter on this story:
