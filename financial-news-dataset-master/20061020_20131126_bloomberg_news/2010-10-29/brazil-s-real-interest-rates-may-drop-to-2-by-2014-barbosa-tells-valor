Brazil’s  benchmark interest rate 
adjusted for  inflation  may drop to 2 percent from about 6
percent currently should the next government deliver a budget
surplus before interest payments of 3.3 percent of gross
domestic product , Valor Economico  reported, citing estimates by
Economic Policy Secretary  Nelson Barbosa .  Barbosa forecast Brazil’s net debt may drop to 27.8 percent
of gross domestic product in 2014 from 39.6 percent this year if
Brazil’s economy averages 5.5 percent growth over the next four
years and the government meets its primary surplus target of 3.3
percent of GDP, Sao Paulo-based newspaper Valor Economico said
today.  The drop in the net debt to GDP ratio isn’t enough to curb
the real’s appreciation, Valor reported Barbosa as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
