ICICI Bank Ltd ., India’s second-
largest lender, said second-quarter profit rose 19 percent,
beating analysts’  estimates , as loans climbed for the first time
in two years and it cut provisions for defaults.  Net income  increased to 12.4 billion rupees ($278 million),
from 10.4 billion rupees a year earlier, according to a
statement sent to the Mumbai exchanges today. Its shares rose to
the highest in more than 2 ½ years after  profit  surpassed the
11.5 billion rupee average of 32 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The acceleration in profit growth may help bolster demand
for Chief Executive Officer  Chanda Kochhar ’s planned $1 billion
overseas bond sale. Mumbai-based ICICI, whose outstanding credit
climbed 5.3 percent during the quarter, benefited from its
purchase of smaller rival Bank of Rajasthan Ltd.  “The bulk of the loan growth came from the acquisition,”
said  Brian Hunsaker , an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Asia
Ltd. in Hong Kong, who rates the stock as “outperform.” “For
now, investors are happy with these numbers. At some point the
bank needs to start producing organic growth: they haven’t done
that yet.”  ICICI  advanced 6.8 percent to 1,163 rupees, the highest
since Feb. 19, 2008, at the 3:30 p.m. close of market. The stock
rose about 33 percent this year, surpassing the 15 percent gain
in the benchmark  Sensitive Index . The stock earlier fell as much
as 1.4 percent after television channels reported incorrect
earnings.  Loan Growth  Corporate credit, driven by lending for infrastructure
projects and trade financing, grew by 30 percent during the
quarter, Kochhar said on a conference-call with reporters today.
The bank’s retail lending portfolio has also “stabilized” and
will grow, and ICICI will be able to meet its target of 18
percent to 20 percent credit growth for the year ending March 31,
the CEO forecast.  The bank’s net non-performing asset ratio narrowed to 1.37
percent from 2.19 percent a year earlier, according to the
statement.  ICICI reduced provisions by 40 percent to 6.41 billion
rupees. Its provisioning coverage ratio under new central bank
guidelines rose to 69 percent, from 64.8 percent in June. The
 Reserve Bank of India  in October 2009 had asked banks to
increase the minimum provision ratio for non-performing assets
to 70 percent, from 10 percent, by September. Kochhar said today
that ICICI, which had received an extension until March 2011,
will reach the required level this quarter.  August Acquisition  The bank’s first  acquisition  of a rival in three years
helped it add 65.3 billion rupees in total loans, according to
the statement today. ICICI bought Bank of Rajasthan, based in
northwest India, on Aug. 12 through a share swap in a
transaction worth as much as 23 billion rupees, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  ICICI’s net interest income, or difference between revenue
from loans and interest paid on deposits, rose 8.3 percent to
22.04 billion rupees from 20.36 billion rupees a year earlier,
the bank said. Fee income climbed 14.6 percent.  The bank’s current and savings accounts ratio, which
excludes more expensive long-term deposits, expanded to 44
percent, from 36.9 percent a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
