German government bonds rose, paring
their weekly drop, tracking an advance in Treasuries amid
speculation the Federal Reserve will resume buying bonds to
safeguard the recovery.  German 10-year bonds pared losses that left the yield on
course for its first back-to-back monthly gains since May 2009.
The notes also rose as the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a second
month in September. Treasuries advanced for the first time in
seven days yesterday as the Fed surveyed bond dealers on how
asset purchases will influence yields.  “All in all, we’re definitely still waiting for the Fed
statement” next week, said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “That’s the most
important piece.”  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark security,
declined one basis point to 2.55 percent as of 8:18 a.m. in
London. It reached 2.59 percent on Oct. 27, the most since Aug.
5. The 2.25 percent security maturing in September 2020 gained
0.11, or 1.1 euro per 1,000-euro ($1,388) face amount, fell to
97.39. The two-year  yield  was at 1.04 percent. It was as high as
1.07 percent two days ago, the most since April 12.  German bonds lost 1.3 percent this month, compared with a
0.5 percent decline for U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Portugal’s securities gained 2.7 percent
while those of Greece handed investors a 0.7 percent return.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield was little changed at 4.2
percent while Greece’s rose four basis points to 10.53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
