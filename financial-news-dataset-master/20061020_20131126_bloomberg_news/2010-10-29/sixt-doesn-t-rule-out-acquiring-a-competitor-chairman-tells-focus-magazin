Sixt AG  Chairman  Erich Sixt  doesn’t
rule out acquiring a competitor, German weekly news magazine
Focus said, citing from an interview.  Sixt’s 510 million euros ($709 million) of own equity puts
the German car-rental company in a stronger position than its
rivals, the management board head is quoted as saying.  Sixt expects to return to pre-crisis levels next year,
according to the magazine. The 66-year-old chairman and majority
shareholder isn’t considering handing over to his two sons,
Focus reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
