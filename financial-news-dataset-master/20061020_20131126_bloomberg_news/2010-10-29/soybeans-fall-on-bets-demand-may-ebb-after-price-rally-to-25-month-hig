Soybeans futures, unchanged today in
Chicago, capped the biggest monthly gain since May 2009 on signs
of increasing demand for supply from the U.S., the world’s
largest exporter.  The price jumped 12 percent this month as China, the
biggest buyer, boosted imports. U.S. export sales rose to 2.026
million metric tons in the week ended Oct. 21, or 40 percent
more than the previous four-week average, government data show.
About two-thirds of the sales went to China.  “Beans continue to have strong demand,” said Mike Zuzolo,
the president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in
Lafayette, Indiana. At export terminals in the Gulf of Mexico,
“they can’t physically load corn because they’re loading so
many beans,” he said.  Soybean futures for January delivery settled unchanged for
a second straight day at $12.36 at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. October marked the fourth straight monthly gain,
the longest streak since February 2008.  Earlier today, soybean futures dropped as much as 0.9
percent on bets that demand will ebb after prices touched a 25-
month high yesterday of $12.4875.  “If it wasn’t for China being such a good buyer of
soybeans, where would we be now?” said  Paul Beere , a market
adviser at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
Wisconsin. “We’d probably be looking at $8 soybeans. It doesn’t
seem like anybody else is a player at this point.”  China plans to stabilize food costs as the economy
maintains momentum, the country’s cabinet said on Oct. 27. The
government will ensure adequate grain production and crack down
on commodity hoarding, the State Council said after a meeting
chaired by Premier Wen Jiabao.  Soybeans are the second-largest U.S. crop, valued at $31.8
billion in 2009, government figures show. Corn is the biggest at
$48.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
