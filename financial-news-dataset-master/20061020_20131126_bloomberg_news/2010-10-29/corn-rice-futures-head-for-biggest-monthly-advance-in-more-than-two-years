Wheat fell in Chicago after the
International Grains Council left its production forecast
unchanged, indicating output losses due to inclement weather
have been accounted for. Corn and soybeans also dropped.  The IGC left its global wheat-production forecast unchanged
at 644 million metric tons while raising the consumption
estimate by 1 million tons. Stockpiles will total 181 million
tons, down 1.1 percent from September’s estimate, the statement
shows.  “We regard the upside potential for wheat prices as
virtually exhausted,” Commerzbank AG analyst Eugen Weinberg
said in a report today.  Wheat for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $7.1575 a bushel, the first drop in six days, as of 12:11
p.m. in London. Before today, the most-active contract gained
6.6 percent this month and 7.1 percent this week.  Prices in Chicago have surged almost 50 percent since the
end of June after drought destroyed Russian crops, prompting
the country to ban exports. Milling wheat for November delivery
on NYSE Liffe in Paris climbed 1 percent to 224.75 euros
($310.94) a metric ton, the sixth advance in a row.  Corn is headed for its biggest monthly advance since June
2008 on concern that global demand will outpace falling U.S.
output.  “Fundamentally, corn will remain bullish after the U.S.
government cut its forecast for crop production,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager of research at IDO Securities Co. in
Tokyo. Prices will also be supported by the outlook for higher
corn and soybean imports by China, he said.  Corn for December delivery in Chicago fell 6.75 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $5.7225 a bushel, paring this month’s gain to 15
percent and this week’s increase to 2.2 percent. The most-active
contract is still set for a fifth straight monthly gain.  Global production at the end of the marketing year on June
30 is expected to be 814 million tons, 1.2 percent less
than last month’s forecast, the IGC said yesterday. Output in
the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter, will be 323
million tons, down 3.3 percent from September’s estimate, after
hot weather in August hurt crops, the council said.  World corn inventories will probably total 125 million tons
on June 30, 6 million tons less than predicted last month, the
London-based IGC said. Demand for the grain will outstrip
production by 3.2 percent, reducing stockpiles for a second
year, the council said.  Shrinking Inventory  Soybeans for January delivery declined 10.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $12.255 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed has climbed
11 percent this month, advancing for the fourth straight month.
The price reached $12.4875 yesterday, the highest level since
Sept. 4, 2008.  Rough-rice for January delivery fell 1.8 percent to $14.815
per 100 pounds after touching $15.27 yesterday, the highest
price since Jan. 4. The most-active contract has gained 18
percent this month, the biggest such advance since February
2008.  Rice has jumped 53 percent since the end of June as
flooding ravaged crops in Thailand and Vietnam, the world’s two
biggest exporters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
