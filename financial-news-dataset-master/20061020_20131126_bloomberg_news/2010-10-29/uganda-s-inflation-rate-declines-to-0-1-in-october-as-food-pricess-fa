Uganda ’s annual inflation rate
declined to 0.1 percent in October, the lowest in more than six
years, after telecommunications costs and the prices of some
food items fell, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said.  Inflation slowed from 0.3 percent a month earlier, the
statistics agency said in a statement handed to reporters today
in Kampala, the capital. Prices fell 0.3 percent in the month,
compared with a rise of 1 percent in September, it said.  Food prices dropped 5.5 percent from a year earlier as the
cost of tomatoes, onions, egg plants, green pepper, cabbage,
potatoes and fresh milk declined, the office said, without
saying how much food and telecommunications costs fell in the
month, it said.  The inflation rate has declined from a high of 14.5 percent
in September 2009, when food prices jumped almost 50 percent
after a drought reduced supplies. Food makes up 27 percent of
the inflation basket.  Underlying inflation, which excludes food, fuel,
electricity and metered-water costs, slowed to 2.5 percent in
October from 4.1 percent in September, the agency said.  Uganda’s central bank plans to introduce policies that will
enable it to target a specific inflation rate over the next five
years, starting with repurchasing government debt in the
secondary market to control money supply, the  Bank of Uganda 
said on Aug. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
