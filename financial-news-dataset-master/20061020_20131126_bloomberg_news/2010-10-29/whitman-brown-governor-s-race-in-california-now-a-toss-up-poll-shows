The race for governor of  California 
between Democrat  Jerry Brown  and Republican  Meg Whitman  is now
rated a “toss-up” instead of “leans Democrat,” according to
Rasmussen Reports.  The polling company made the shift on its national
 Gubernatorial Scorecard  after a  survey  of likely voters released
today showed Brown drawing 49 percent support and Whitman
getting 45 percent. Last week, a poll found that Brown had a 48-
to-42 percent lead over Whitman.  Brown, 72, the state’s attorney general and a former
governor, and Whitman, 54, a former  EBay  Inc. chief executive
officer, are vying to lead the most populous U.S. state. The
winner will confront a resurgent deficit that may equal this
year’s $19 billion gap and an  unemployment rate  at 12.4 percent
in September, the third-highest behind Nevada and Michigan.  Brown led Whitman 49-to-39 percent among likely voters in a
 Field Poll  released Oct. 28. A month earlier they were tied at
41 percent each.  The Rasmussen survey of 750 likely voters was conducted on
Oct. 27 and has a margin for error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
