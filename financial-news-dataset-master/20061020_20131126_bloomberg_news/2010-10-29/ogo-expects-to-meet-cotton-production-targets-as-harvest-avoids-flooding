Togo , one of the world’s poorest
countries, expects to meet a target of increasing cotton output
70 percent this season after the bulk of the crop avoided the
worst effects of flooding.  “We believe we may achieve our goal of increasing cotton
production to 50,000 metric tons this year,” Baba Djabakatie,
general secretary of the Togolese Cotton Producers Federation,
said by phone yesterday from Sokode, 350 kilometers (215 miles)
north of the capital, Lome. “The cotton fields haven’t been
affected by the floods and farmers are harvesting their crop.”  Heavy rains that started more than a month ago have led to
floods which have displaced more than 2,000 people, Kpatcha
Afeignidou, a government official, said on Oct. 14.  Earlier sowing and avoiding possible floodplains when
planting cotton has helped farmers avoid the worst of the
flooding, Djabakatie said. The bulk of Togo’s cotton is produced
by small-scale farmers, using an average of 2 hectares (5 acres)
or less per farm, said Djabakatie, whose association oversees
about 300,000 farmers.  Togo’s gross domestic product per capita of $240, compared
with the sub-Saharan African average of $580, according to the
World Bank. The United Nations Development Programme’s Human
Development Index, which measures life expectancy, literacy and
standards of living, ranks the West African nation 159th out of
182 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
