Libyan investors wanted to take
control of UniCredit SpA as they built up stakes in the Italian
bank, Flavio Tosi, mayor of Verona, told la Repubblica in an
interview.  Verona is the largest shareholder in Fondazione Cariverona,
one of UniCredit’s main investors.  “It’s obvious” there was an attempt to take over the
bank, Tosi told the daily.  Tosi is a member of the Northern League party,which has
criticized the Libyan investments. Tensions between UniCredit’s
management and foundation shareholders increased after two
Libyan investors raised their stakes, leading Chief Executive
Officer Alessandro Profumo to resign Sept. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
