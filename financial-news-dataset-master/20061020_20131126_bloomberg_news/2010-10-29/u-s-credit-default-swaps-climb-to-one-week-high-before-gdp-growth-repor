The cost of protecting bonds from
default in the U.S. rose for a third day before a government
report that may show the American economy requires more central-
bank stimulus.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 1.1 basis point to a
mid-price of 95.1 basis points as of 8:09 a.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, touched the lowest in
more than five months Oct. 26 at 92.5 basis points.  The U.S. economy probably grew at a faster pace in the
third quarter as consumer spending climbed, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists before today’s report. That gain
may not be enough to cut the jobless rate of almost 10 percent,
a concern that may lead the Federal Reserve next week to pump
more money into the world’s largest economy.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point, 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
