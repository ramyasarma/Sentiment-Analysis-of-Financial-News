U.S. Treasury yields may resume
their decline as economic slowdown concerns overtake efforts by
the Federal Reserve to boost growth and fight deflation,
according to HSBC Securities Japan Ltd.  Treasuries are set for their first monthly decline since
March on prospects the Fed will increase bond purchases next
week in a new round of so-called quantitative easing. Inflation-
linked securities show traders’ expectations for consumer prices
rose for a second month. Even so, yields face downward pressure
as long as the U.S. economy stagnates, said  Seiji Shiraishi ,
chief economist at HSBC in Tokyo.  “This is the best time to buy Treasuries, whose prices
have dropped amid inflation expectations,” Shiraishi said.
“U.S. long-term yields will resume a declining trend sooner or
later.”  Yields on 10-year Treasuries reached 2.33 percent on Oct.
8, the lowest since January 2009, before surging 40 basis points
to 2.73 percent on Oct. 27 as expectations for inflation
increased.  The pace of gains in core consumer prices will slow in the
fourth quarter as household purchases, which account for about
70 percent of the U.S. economy, fail to gain momentum, Shiraishi
said.  The consumer-price index rose 0.1 percent in September
after 0.3 percent gains in the prior two months, according to
Labor Department data. The core rate rose 0.8 percent from
September 2009, the smallest year-over-year gain since 1961.  To contact the reporter on this story:
