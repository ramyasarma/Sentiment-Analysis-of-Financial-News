EBay Inc. ’s PayPal online-payment
business said its service is functioning again for most users
after an outage that lasted about an hour and a half.  Users had trouble logging into their accounts as well as
sending and receiving money, the San Jose, California-based
company said today in a blog posting. PayPal supports payments
in 24 currencies and has localized websites in 20 countries.  PayPal’s 90 million active users normally send and receive
$2,700 per second through the service, the company said. That
would equate to about $14.6 million in funds that didn’t move
during the outage, according to a Bloomberg calculation.  The company had a  six-hour outage  last year in August.
PayPal, which estimates it controls about 10 percent of the
online payment-processing market, charges merchants a fee every
time a customer pays.  Some users were still experiencing intermittent disruptions
after service was restored. Those glitches have been fixed,
PayPal said.  EBay  rose  14 cents to $29.86 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have climbed 27 percent
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
