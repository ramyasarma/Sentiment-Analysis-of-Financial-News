Copper declined from London to
Shanghai, paring a fourth monthly gain, on concern that the
recent rally in prices slowed purchases in China, the world’s
largest consumer.  Three-month-delivery copper fell as much as 1.2 percent to
$8,237 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the lowest
level since Oct. 20, and traded at $8,244.75 at 1:20 p.m. in
Singapore, up 2.9 percent this month. The metal is heading for a
fourth monthly advance, the longest rally in more than a year,
as the  dollar  is poised to drop for a second month against a
basket of six currencies.  “China’s copper market has been firmly in contango for a
while now, with very few transactions on the spot market, so
expectations are for domestic stockpiles to increase again this
week,” said Yang Zhenqiang, an analyst at First Futures
Brokerage Co. A contango is a situation where a contract for
immediate delivery is cheaper than longer-dated supplies,
signaling ample short-term availability.  Futures in Shanghai lost as much as 2.4 percent to 62,5100
yuan ($9,362) a ton, before trading at 62,750 yuan at 1:45 p.m.,
up 3.7 percent this month. Spot copper in Changjiang, Shanghai’s
biggest cash market, traded at a discount of about 695 yuan a
ton to futures yesterday, compared with a premium of more than
1,000 yuan in July, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Stockpiles of the metal monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange may have increased for a fourth week this week, growing
by about 7,000 tons, according to Shenzhen Rongtuo Trading Co.
Inventories were at a two-month high of 106,275 tons last week.  “China’s demand has been driving prices higher and on
signs of it tapering off, the rally will be difficult to sustain
in the short term,” said Yang.  Aluminum in London fell 1 percent to $2,323 a ton, zinc
dropped 2.2 percent to $2,440 a ton and lead declined 2 percent
to $2,455 a ton. Nickel lost 1.1 percent to $22,850 a ton, while
tin fell 0.6 percent to $26,100 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
