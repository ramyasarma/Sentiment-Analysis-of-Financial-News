Australia’s  sovereign wealth fund 
plans to increase property and infrastructure investments and
cut debt holdings this fiscal year to diversify A$69.3 billion
($68 billion) of assets.  The Future Fund aims to raise the proportion of assets in
property and infrastructure to 14.5 percent on June 30, 2011,
from 9.5 percent a year earlier, it said today in its  annual
report . Debt will account for 16 percent, down from 21.9 percent.  The changes follow a review of the fund’s investment
strategy after the global financial crisis. The new allocations
aim to deliver annual returns of between 8 percent and 9 percent
in the long term and avoid capital losses in any three-year
period, the report said.  “Our portfolio must be reasonably robust in a range of
economic scenarios,” the report said.  The proportion of funds in so-called alternative assets,
such as hedge funds, will rise to 20 percent on June 30, 2011,
from 15.6 percent a year earlier, the fund said. Equities will
account for 40 percent, little changed from the previous year.  According to the fund’s new Long-Term Strategic Asset
Allocation, a mix that will be achieved over several years,
stocks will account for 40 percent of assets, debt 15 percent,
tangible assets such as property 25 percent, alternative assets
15 percent, and cash 5 percent, according to the annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
