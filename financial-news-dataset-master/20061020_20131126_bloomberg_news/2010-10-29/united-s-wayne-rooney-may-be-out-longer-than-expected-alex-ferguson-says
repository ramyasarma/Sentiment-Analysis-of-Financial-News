Manchester United striker  Wayne Rooney  may be sidelined longer than first thought by an ankle
injury, manager  Alex Ferguson  said.  Rooney, who signed a new five-year contract with United on
Oct. 22 after saying he wanted to leave the club, was hurt in
training last week and was expected to miss three weeks. He’s
been on holiday in Dubai with his wife as he recovers.  “It may be longer,” Ferguson said today at a news
conference. “There is no recovery, it is just rest. Before he
went away we did his remedial in terms of what we could do at
the time. Thereafter, rest, we’re quite happy with that.”  Rooney last week said he wanted to leave the 18-time
English champion, saying the club had no ambition in signing new
players. He received a deal that will pay him a reported 250,000
pounds ($397,000) a week two days later.  United is third in the Premier League behind Arsenal on
goal difference, five points back of leader Chelsea. The Reds
host Tottenham tomorrow at Old Trafford.  To contact the reporter on this story:
