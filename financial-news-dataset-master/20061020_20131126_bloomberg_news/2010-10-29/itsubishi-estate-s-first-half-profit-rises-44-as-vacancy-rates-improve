Mitsubishi Estate Co. , Japan’s
second-biggest developer, said first-half net income rose 44
percent as office vacancy rates improved, helping boost revenue
at its leasing business.  Net income  rose to 28.7 billion yen ($356 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30 from 19.9 billion yen in the same
period a year earlier, the company said in a statement
distributed through the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. Sales gained
0.2 percent to 430.9 billion yen.  The owner of about 30 office buildings in Tokyo’s central
business district is seeing a recovery in its occupancy rate,
supporting profit growth. The vacancy rate at the firm fell to
4.02 percent in September from 4.46 percent in June, a five-year
high, according to Mitsubishi Estate.  Mitsubishi Estate reiterated its full-year profit forecast
of 63 billion yen on sales of 975 billion yen. Leasing revenue
rose 8.2 percent to 201.7 billion yen in the fiscal first half,
it said.  Shares  of Mitsubishi Estate fell 3.4 percent to 1,410 yen
at the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, extending its
year-to-date decline to 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
