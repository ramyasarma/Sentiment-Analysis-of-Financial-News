Eni SpA , the Italian oil company
that acquired two oil blocks in  Togo  this month, is expected to
take two years searching for crude off the coast of the West
African nation, Togolese Energy Minister  Noupokou Dammipi  said.  “We hope the research will succeed, because a discovery of
oil will bring many resources to satisfy our people’s needs and
accelerate the economic development of the country,” Dammipi
said in a phone interview yesterday from the capital, Lome.  Eni announced on Oct. 21 it bought Block 1 and Block 2 off
the coast of Togo with 100 percent participation interest. Togo
borders  Nigeria , Africa’s biggest oil producer.  “Eni will finance the entire research and if oil is
discovered, it will also have the privilege to operate it,”
Dammipi said.  Togo is one of the world’s poorest countries, with gross
domestic product per capita of $240, compared with the sub-
Saharan African average of $580, according to the World Bank.
The United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development
Index, which measures life expectancy, literacy and standards of
living, ranks the West African nation 159th out of 182
countries.  Togo relies on phosphates, a mineral used in making
fertilizers, to generate most of its foreign exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
