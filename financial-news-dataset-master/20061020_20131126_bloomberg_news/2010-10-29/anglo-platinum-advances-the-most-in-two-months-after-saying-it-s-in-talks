Anglo Platinum Ltd. , the largest
producer of the metal, gained the most in almost two months in
Johannesburg trading after saying it’s in talks that may have a
“material effect” on its shares.  The stock advanced the most since Sept. 1, rising 23 rand,
or 3.4 percent, to 693 rand at the 5 p.m. close of trade. The
Johannesburg-based company is controlled by  Anglo American Plc .  “Shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing
in the company’s securities until a detailed announcement is
made,” Anglo Platinum said today in a stock exchange statement.
 Mary-Jane Morifi , a company spokeswoman, didn’t answer calls to
her mobile phone seeking comment.  James Wyatt-Tilby , a spokesman for London-based Anglo
American, couldn’t be reached.  “I think they are still looking to sell assets,”  Leon Esterhuizen , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said by phone
from London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
