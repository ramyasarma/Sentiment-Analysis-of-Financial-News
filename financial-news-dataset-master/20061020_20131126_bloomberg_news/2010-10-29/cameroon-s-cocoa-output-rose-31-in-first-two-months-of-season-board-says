Cocoa production in Cameroon, the
fifth-largest producer of the chocolate ingredient, rose 31
percent in the first two months of the season, according to the
country’s Cocoa and Coffee Board.  Output for the eight weeks to Sept. 30 rose to 42,133
metric tons from 32,165 tons a year earlier, the board said in
an e-mailed report today, without giving a reason for the
increase.  Yields in Cameroon are benefitting from the introduction of
high-yielding cocoa plants, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture. Farmers have received almost 8 million new plants
during the past three-to-five years, Emerand Evenga, spokesman
for the ministry, said by phone today from Yaounde, the capital.  “Farmers in the central region now produce as much as
their colleagues in the southwest where production is highest,”
he said, without comment further.  The Central African nation’s cocoa season runs from August
through July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
