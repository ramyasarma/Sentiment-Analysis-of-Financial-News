Grupo Mexico SAB , the country’s
largest mining company, said third-quarter profit rose 58
percent because of higher copper prices.  Net income  increased to $451.6 million from $286.4 million
in the year-earlier period, the company based in Mexico City
said yesterday in a statement to the Mexican Stock Exchange.
Sales climbed 42 percent to $2 billion.  The mining group, controlled by billionaire  German Larrea ,
paid creditors $3.63 billion on Dec. 9 to regain control of
Asarco, a previously bankrupt copper unit. Asarco posted revenue
of $414.6 million, or 21 percent of Grupo Mexico’s quarterly
sales.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange averaged $7,278 a metric ton in the quarter, 24 percent
higher than the prior year.  Grupo Mexico’s transportation unit also boosted profit
after increasing volumes and prices, said  Rodrigo Heredia , an
analyst with Ixe Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico City, in a note to
clients before the earnings report was released.  Revenue from Ferromex, one of Grupo Mexico’s transportation
units and the country’s largest rail company by track miles,
rose 17 percent to $303.7 million. Grupo Mexico plans to spin
off its transportation unit, Chief Financial Officer  Daniel Muniz  said in a May 21 interview.  Heredia had forecast third-quarter profit of $385 million
for the mining group and rates the stock a “buy.” He has a
year-end target price of 45.5 pesos.  Mexico City Trading  Grupo Mexico rose 57 centavos to 40.44 pesos in Mexico City
trading before the earnings report. The stock has climbed 56
percent in the past 12 months.  Revenue from Asarco, based in Tucson, Arizona, was $414.6
million in the quarter.  Grupo Mexico said July 23 it plans to merge its Asarco LLC
and Southern Copper units into a single business to save costs.  Southern Copper Corp ., the Grupo Mexico unit that accounts
for 63 percent of the parent company’s total revenue, said
yesterday its sales rose 9.6 percent to $1.26 billion.  Grupo Mexico said that Southern Copper’s investments for
the next five years will total $5.6 billion. The Phoenix-based
unit will allocate $3.8 billion for investments in Mexico and
$1.8 billion for Peru, according to the statement.  Southern Copper said it sold 58 percent of its fourth-
quarter copper output at $3.67 a pound and 11 percent of next
year’s production at $3.73 a pound “to reduce price
volatility.”  Asarco hedged 37 percent of its 2011 copper output at $3.70
per pound and 50 percent of its fourth-quarter 2010 copper
production at $3.50 per pound.  -- With assistance from  Alex Emery  in Lima. Editors:  Robin Saponar ,  Jonathan Roeder   To contact the reporter on this story:
