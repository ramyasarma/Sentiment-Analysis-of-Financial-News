Morgan Stanley analysts advised
investors to buy the pound against the yen, and the Swedish
krona versus the euro.  “The recent gross domestic product data is potentially a
game-changer for the pound,”  Stephen Hull , head of global
currency strategy in London, wrote in a research report dated
yesterday. “In a world where there isn’t much value to be found
in currencies, the krona is one of the least expensive.”  Sterling rose 1.2 percent against the yen since Oct. 25,
the day before data showed the U.K. economy grew 0.8 percent in
the third quarter, twice as much as economists forecast. It
traded at 128.56 yen as of 7:04 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
