Crude oil futures traded in London
will fail to advance beyond $85 a barrel and may drop toward a
pair of moving averages near $78, according to technical
analysis by Commerzbank AG.  Brent crude on the ICE Futures Europe exchange failed to
rise to $85 a barrel since settling at $85.46 two weeks ago,
indicating resistance at this level, Commerzbank said in a
weekly report yesterday. Brent, trading around $83 today, will
likely be drawn back to this month’s low at $80.75 and, if that
support point is broken, may plunge toward $78, according to
Germany’s second-biggest bank.  Commerzbank  forecasts the commodity will be pulled to its
55-day and 200-day moving averages, at $79.19 and $78.29
respectively. This price region also corresponds to a 38.2
percent retracement of Brent’s rally since May, it said. The
significance of a 38.2 percent movement comes from the Fibonacci
sequence of numbers used to predict points of support and
resistance.  “Brent crude oil has not managed to maintain a foothold
over $85, and as a consequence the near-term risk has shifted to
the downside,”  Karen Anne Jones , an analyst at the bank, said
in the report. “We would allow for a retest of the $80.75
support area.”  North Sea Brent crude is used as a marker for two-thirds of
global oil trade.  Prices will hold steady if they retreat as far as the two
moving averages, she said. Brent will likely be supported
against further losses by a trend-line connecting the lowest
points of the past five months, at about $74.20, Jones said.  If instead Brent rises and surpasses this month’s high at
$86.02, it will likely rally further to this year’s peak at
$89.58 a barrel, reached on May 3, she said.  It will stall at the “psychological” barrier of $90 a
barrel, Jones said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
