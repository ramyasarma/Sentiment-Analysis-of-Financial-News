New Hope Group Co. has no plans to
import any additional corn because high international prices
have made buying from overseas unprofitable, said Liu Yonghao,
company chairman.  The company, which consumes 12 million metric tons of corn
a year, imported “several hundred thousand tons” of corn
earlier this year when domestic prices were higher, Liu told
reporters in Beijing. New Hope is the biggest maker of livestock
feed in China.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
