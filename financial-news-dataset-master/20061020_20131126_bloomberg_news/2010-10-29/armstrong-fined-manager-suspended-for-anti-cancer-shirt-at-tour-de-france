Lance Armstrong  and his RadioShack
teammates were fined 2,500 Swiss Francs ($2,539) after they wore
unapproved jerseys with an anti-cancer theme on what was his
last day riding the Tour de France.  RadioShack team manager  Johan Bruyneel  must also pay 10,000
Swiss Francs and serve a two-month suspension in February and
March, Aigle, Switzerland-based ruling body Union Cycliste
Internationale said in an e-mailed statement.  The final Tour stage on July 25 was delayed 20 minutes
while Armstrong and his teammates were told to change out of
black jerseys with the number 28 on. It was a reference to the
28 million people fighting cancer, a theme of the seven-time
champion’s cancer charity Livestrong.  On July 26, the UCI had said the team should have
coordinated the plan with organizers, adding any fines will be
donated to a Swiss cancer group. The UCI said today that
Bruyneel had also “publicly offended” the ruling body’s staff
over the affair.  Armstrong said before the race it would be his last Tour de
France. He finished the race 23rd overall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
