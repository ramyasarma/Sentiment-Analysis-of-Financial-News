German stocks retreated, with the
benchmark DAX Index falling 0.4 percent to 6,571.92 as of 10:54
a.m. in Frankfurt. Metro AG and Siemens AG both fell at least
1.5 percent.  The DAX is still heading for the biggest monthly gain since
March amid speculation policy makers at the U.S. Federal Reserve
will announce another round of asset purchases at their November
meeting in a bid to jumpstart economic growth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
