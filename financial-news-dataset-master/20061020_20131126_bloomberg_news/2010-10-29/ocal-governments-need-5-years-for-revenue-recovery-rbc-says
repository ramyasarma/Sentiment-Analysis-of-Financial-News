State and local tax revenue won’t
rebound to pre-financial crisis levels for another five years,
according to about half of the public-finance professionals
surveyed by RBC Capital Markets.  While 46 percent of them, including government officials
and bankers, said it would take more than five years for states
and municipalities to recover, 29 percent said revenue will
recover in four years and 3 percent within the next two years.
The survey, released today, was based on the answers of 103
people and conducted at the Bond Buyer’s 20th Annual California
Public Finance Conference in San Francisco Oct. 6-8.  U.S. state tax revenue rose for a second straight quarter
through June 30, driven by gains in collections of sales taxes,
the Census Bureau reported Sept. 27. State and local  revenue  was
$1.271 trillion for the 12 months through June, compared with
$1.265 trillion for 2009. Respondents in the RBC survey don’t
see a rising trend in municipal defaults through 2011.  When asked to forecast the level of defaults, 55 percent
anticipate that municipalities will fail to honor less than $2
billion of debt in 2011. This compares with the default on more
than $2 billion of debt this year through Sept. 30, according to
October’s Distressed Debt Securities Newsletter. The total fell
to $7.3 billion last year from $8.2 billion in 2008.  “While state and local governments have seen steep
declines in revenues, the risk of defaults on bonds issued by
these municipalities generally remains well below similarly
rated corporate debt,” said  Chris Mauro , RBC’s director of
municipal bond research, in a statement accompanying the survey.  Almost half of participants expressed concern about the
potential decline in federal aid to municipalities in the next
three years.  RBC Capital Markets is a division of Toronto-based  Royal
Bank of Canada.   To contact the reporter on this story:
