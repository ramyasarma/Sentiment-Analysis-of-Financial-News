Siemens AG  ended a job-cutting
program at its German computer services division SIS,  Die Welt 
reported, citing  Christian Oecking , the unit’s acting chief
executive officer.  The company cut 2,000 jobs in Germany, according to the
report. Outside Germany, Siemens achieved about 70 percent of a
job-reduction target of 2,200, Oecking told the newspaper.  Overall restructuring costs will be “a bit lower” than
the 400 million euros ($555 million) to 500 million euros
originally estimated, and the largest share of the expenses will
be booked in the fourth quarter, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
