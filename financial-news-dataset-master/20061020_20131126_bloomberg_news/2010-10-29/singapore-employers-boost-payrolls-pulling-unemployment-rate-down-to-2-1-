Singapore employers expanded
payrolls for a fifth consecutive quarter, pushing the jobless
rate to the lowest in 2 1/2 years.  The city-state added an estimated 24,100 jobs in the three
months ended September, after the creation of 24,900 positions
in the second quarter of 2010, the  Ministry of Manpower  said in
a statement today. The seasonally adjusted  unemployment rate 
fell to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent the previous quarter,
beating the median estimate of 2.2 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of 12 economists.  Singapore’s services industry is still expanding even after
weakening overseas demand for manufactured goods caused the
economy to contract last quarter. The city’s two casino resorts
run by Genting Singapore Plc and Las Vegas Sands Corp. have
attracted millions to its gaming centers, helping boost spending
at malls and restaurants.  “The employment creation came primarily from services,”
the Ministry of Manpower said today. “Construction employment
rose marginally due to the completion of major building projects
earlier in the year.”  The services industry added 24,100 jobs last quarter while
 construction  companies increased hiring by 100, the report
showed, citing preliminary data. The manufacturing industry cut
400 jobs. A total of 85,500 jobs have been created in the first
nine months of 2010.  Singapore’s central bank this week reiterated the
government’s forecast for a 2010 expansion of as much as 15
percent, and said the $182 billion economy will “grow in line
with its potential” in 2011, without providing figures.  “Compared to this year, when the manufacturing sector
experienced a sharp surge in activity, gross domestic product
growth next year will be driven more by the services sector,”
the central bank said Oct 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
