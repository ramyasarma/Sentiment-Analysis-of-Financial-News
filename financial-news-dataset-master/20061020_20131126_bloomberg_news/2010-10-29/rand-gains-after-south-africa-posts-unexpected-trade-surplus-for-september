The rand gained against the dollar
after South Africa posted an unexpected trade surplus in
September.  The currency of Africa’s largest economy traded 0.1 percent
stronger at 6.9826 versus the dollar as of 2:04 p.m. in
Johannesburg after earlier weakening as much as 0.7 percent to
7.0397.  The surplus of 3.6 billion rand ($513 million) followed a
deficit of 4.7 billion rand in August, the South African Revenue
Service said in an e-mailed statement today. The median estimate
of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a shortfall of
2.3 billion rand.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
