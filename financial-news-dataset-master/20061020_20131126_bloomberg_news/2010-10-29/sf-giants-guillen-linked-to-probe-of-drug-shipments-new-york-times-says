Jose Guillen  of the San
Francisco Giants has been linked to a federal investigation
into shipments of performance-enhancing drugs, the New York
Times said, citing lawyers familiar with the inquiry.  The probe involves shipments of human growth hormone
that allegedly were sent to Guillen’s wife in the San
Francisco area, the Times said.  Guillen isn’t on San Francisco’s roster for the World
Series, in which the Giants hold a 2-0 lead over the Texas
Rangers.  Major League Baseball spokesman  Pat Courtney  didn’t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Giants manager  Bruce Bochy  said after last night’s 9-0 win over the Texas
Rangers in Game 2 of the World Series that he could not
talk about whether a drug investigation was the reason why
Guillen was left off the roster.  “I can’t comment on that,” Bochy said. “I don’t
know anything about it, and right now I don’t have a
comment on that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
