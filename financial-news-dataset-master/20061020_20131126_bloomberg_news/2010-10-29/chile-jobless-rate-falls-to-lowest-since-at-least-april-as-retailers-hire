Chile’s  unemployment rate  fell to
its lowest level since at least April for the three months
through September as the agriculture, retail and construction
industries stepped up hiring.  The jobless rate fell to 8 percent through September from
8.3 percent in the three months through August, the National
Statistics Institute said in a report today. The median estimate
of 16 economists  surveyed by Bloomberg  was for the unemployment
rate to be 8.1 percent. The institute  changed its methodology 
for measuring unemployment in April 2010.  The unemployment rate will continue to fall, rounding out
the year at about 7.5 percent,  Juan Pablo Castro , an economist
at Banco Santander SA in Santiago, said today. Chile’s labor
market creates inflationary pressures when the jobless rate
falls below 7.5 percent, he said.  “This is one more source of inflation that the central
bank will have to monitor when it thinks about 2011,” he said
in a telephone interview. “Jobs are being created in industries
that are quite dynamic like retail. Construction increased,
which is good news for 2011 because the industry has not
performed very well this year.”  The construction industry hired 7,360 workers in the three
months through September after shedding 4,300 jobs in the
previous period, the institute said. The agriculture industry
hired 17,000 workers as retailers added 7,460 new jobs, the
institute said.  Holiday Season  Retailers usually increase hiring for the holiday season at
the end of the year as the agriculture industry adds jobs after
winter ends in August, Castro said.  Chile’s unemployment rate averaged 9.6 percent last year,
up from 7.7 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2007, the
International Monetary Fund said in a Sept. 29 report.  The country’s  unemployment rate  was 9.7 percent in the
three months through January as the country recovered from its
worst recession in more than a decade.  Chile’s economy has since recovered and could grow 5.5
percent this year, which would be its fastest pace since 2005,
according to central bank estimates.  The jobless rate fell from 8.8 percent in the three months
through May to 8.5 percent and below in the winter months of
June, July and August.  Chile’s unemployment rate could fall below 8 percent in
summer months of December through February, Finance Minister
 Felipe Larrain  told reporters in Santiago on Oct. 26.  The peso was little changed at 489.25 per dollar at 11:10
a.m. New York time from 489.39 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
