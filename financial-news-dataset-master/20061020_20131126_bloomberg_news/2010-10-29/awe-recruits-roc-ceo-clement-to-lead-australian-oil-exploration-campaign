AWE Ltd. , an Australian oil and gas
explorer that has embarked on a A$175 million ($171 million)
drilling program, said it named Roc Oil Co.’s  Bruce Clement  as
managing director.  Clement,  Roc Oil  chief executive officer since 2008, will
replace Bruce Wood in February, Sydney-based AWE said in a
statement today to the Australian stock exchange. AWE announced
July 30 that Wood had decided to retire as he turns 60.  Roc  fell 4.6 percent to 41.5 Australian cents a share by
the market’s 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney, the biggest drop in five
weeks, valuing the company at A$296 million. AWE gained 0.3
percent to A$1.505, giving it a market value of A$785 million.
The  S&P/ASX 200 Index  fell 0.5 percent.  Roc, an explorer with assets in Australia, China and
Africa, has fallen 35 percent in Sydney since the company said
Feb. 3 that its reserves would likely decline by as much as 25
percent. The company slashed estimated reserves at the Basker-
Manta project off southeast Australia after a review of the
field.  Clement, 53, said in a statement today that Roc had
“overcome a number of challenges.” The Sydney-based explorer
named Chief Operating Officer  Alan Linn  acting CEO and said a
search for a successor would likely take “several” months.  The performance of the Basker-Manta fields “continues to
be unsatisfactory and the reduction of existing exposure to the
African asset portfolio is taking longer than anticipated,” the
company said in a separate statement today. “These challenges
will be addressed.”  Roc said it expects to make a final investment decision on
the Beibu Gulf project in China before the end of the year to
drive growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
