Shares in Japan’s power companies
are likely to rally as the difference between their dividend
yield and those of Japanese government bonds is the highest in
more than seven years, Fisco Ltd. said.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the spread between the dividend
yield of Japan’s nine biggest electricity companies and the
benchmark 10-year bond is about 2 percentage points, the widest
since June 2003. The average dividend yield in the Nikkei 225
Stock Average is about 1.3 percentage points less than that of
the utilities.  “There are other stocks with higher dividend yields, but
the electricity companies have strong credit ratings,” said
 Tadashi Fujii , an analyst at Fisco, a Tokyo-based research
company. “Their volatility is low and we can expect gains in
their share prices. This is a great time to invest.”  Electricity stocks fell by between 6.5 percent and 19
percent through yesterday since Sept. 28, when Japanese media
reported Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s plan to raise about 450
billion yen ($5.5 billion) selling new shares. The Nikkei 225
has dropped 2.5 percent in the same period.  Shares in Tepco, Asia’s biggest electricity, fell to the
lowest in almost eight years on Sept. 30, amid concerns the new
stock would dilute earnings. The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year
government bond was 0.905 percent yesterday, down from 1.186
percent on Sept. 6.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
