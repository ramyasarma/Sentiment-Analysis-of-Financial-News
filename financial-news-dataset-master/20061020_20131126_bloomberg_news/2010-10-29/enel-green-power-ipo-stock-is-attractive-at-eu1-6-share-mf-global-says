The revised minimum price of 1.60
euros a share for the initial public offering of Enel Green
Power is now “attractive,” MF Global said in a note sent to
clients today. Enel SpA, Italy’s biggest utility, is offering
shares in EGP for 1.60 euros to 2.10 euros each.  The alternative energy unit of Enel is “at discount to
peers,” at the bottom of the price range, MF Global said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
