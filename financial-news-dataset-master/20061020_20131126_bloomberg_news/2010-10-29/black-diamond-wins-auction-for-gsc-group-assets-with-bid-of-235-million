Black Diamond Capital Management LLC
won a bankruptcy auction for the assets of  GSC Group Inc. , an
investment firm founded by a former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
partner.  Black Diamond ’s winning bid was $235 million,  Michael Solow , a bankruptcy lawyer for GSC, said in an e-mail today.
Black Diamond, which has offices in Greenwich, Connecticut, and
Lake Forest, Illinois, is an asset manager and lender to GSC.  GSC, based in Florham Park, New Jersey, filed for
bankruptcy on Aug. 31, blaming losses in its funds caused by the
credit crisis and an “extremely unfavorable global business
environment.”  The company, founded by former Goldman partner  Alfred Eckert III , managed $28 billion at its peak, according to court
papers. By the end of March, GSC reported $8.4 billion of assets
under management.  Michael Moreno, a principal at Black Diamond, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  The case is In re GSC Group Inc., 10-14653, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan)  To contact the reporters on this story:
