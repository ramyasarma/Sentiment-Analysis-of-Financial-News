Russian President Dmitry Medvedev’s
approval rating reached a statistical tie with Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin’s for the first time after the ouster of Moscow
Mayor Yury Luzhkov, Vedomosti reported.  Seventy-six percent of Russians approve of Medvedev’s
handling of his Kremlin role, compared to 77 percent for Putin’s
work as head of the government, a difference that’s less than
the margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, the Moscow-based
newspaper said today, citing a national Levada Center poll.  Putin’s lead over Medvedev averaged 5 points to 6 points
last year, Vedomosti said. Twenty-four percent of respondents
said they’d vote for Putin if presidential elections were held
today, versus 21 percent for Medvedev, according to the survey,
which was conducted Oct. 22-25. Putin’s lead on the presidential
question varied between 9 percent and 11 percent until now,
Vedomosti said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
