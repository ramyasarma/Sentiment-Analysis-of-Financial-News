Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  said
users of its search-engine service may now access technology
supplied by  Sohu.com Inc. , as the two Chinese companies 
strengthen collaboration to challenge industry leader  Baidu Inc.   Users of Alibaba’s Etao.com search service may now opt for
the Sogou software, in addition to Microsoft Corp.’s Bing
technology, Justine Chao, a spokeswoman at Alibaba, said by
phone today.  Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce company, is stepping up
efforts to diversify in the search-engine market, after starting
trials of its Etao.com service this month and agreeing an
investment in Sogou in August. Baidu, based in Beijing, has
gained users and advertisers this year after main rival  Google
Inc.  closed its Chinese site and redirected local subscribers
offshore to avoid online censorship rules.  Sohu, operator of China’s fourth most-visited web portal,
in August agreed to sell a combined 16 percent stake in Sogou to
Alibaba Chairman  Jack Ma  and his company.  Baidu increased its share of China’s search-engine market
to 72.9 percent in the third quarter from 71 percent three
months earlier, according to research company iResearch Inc.
Google’s share dropped to 24.6 percent from 26.8 percent,
according to the Shanghai-based researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
