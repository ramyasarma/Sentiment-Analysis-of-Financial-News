MTN Group Ltd.  and  Vodacom Group
Ltd. ’s call termination rates were set at 0.73 cents ($0.10)
from March following South African government demands to bring
down the world’s third-highest interconnection rates.  Peak call rates for the two companies were set at 56 cents
from March 2012 to February 2013 and will drop to 40 cents after
that, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa,
the industry regulator, said in an e-mailed statement from
Johannesburg today.  “It is a well-known reality that South African citizens
are concerned about the amount of money they spend every month
on the basic necessity of electronic communications,” Icasa
councilor Thabo Makhakhe said in the statement.  Vodacom, the biggest provider of mobile-phone services to
South Africans, said the decision will likely boost competition
and lead to lower call charges.  “The agreed glide path gives us time to adjust our
business model in order to accommodate the significant further
revenue reduction that will result from the changes,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  Vodacom  lost 0.1 percent to 66.75 rand at 1:40 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading, while Telkom South Africa Ltd., Africa’s
largest fixed-line operator, declined 0.3 percent to 35.99 rand.
MTN gained 0.7 percent to 124.86 rand.  Minister of Communications  Siphiwe Nyanda  ordered Icasa a
year ago to implement a directive for operators to cut rates to
levels that reflect costs associated with carrying each other’s
calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
