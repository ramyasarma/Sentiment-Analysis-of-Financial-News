Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
called on Myanmar’s military leaders to change their policies
and release  Aung San Suu Kyi , the longtime political prisoner.  Clinton criticized planned Nov. 7 elections in Myanmar as
“deeply flawed” and pointed to “ongoing human rights abuses
inflicted by the military junta,” as an example of the many
challenges that remain in Asia.  Clinton made the remarks yesterday during a policy speech
in Hawaii that stressed the U.S. intention to maintain its
leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy address marked
the start of a two-week tour through Southeast Asia, including a
stop in Vietnam, where she will attend the East Asian Summit.  “Burma will soon hold a deeply flawed election, and one
thing we have learned over the last few years is that democracy
is more than elections,” Clinton said, referring to the country
by its former name. “We will make clear to Burma’s new leaders,
old and new alike, that they must break from the policies of the
past.”  Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been under house
arrest for the better part of two decades. She leads the
National League for Democracy, which won a landslide election in
1990. The junta barred the party from ever taking office and it
was banned from taking part in next month’s voting.  “Her imprisonment must come to an end,” Clinton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
