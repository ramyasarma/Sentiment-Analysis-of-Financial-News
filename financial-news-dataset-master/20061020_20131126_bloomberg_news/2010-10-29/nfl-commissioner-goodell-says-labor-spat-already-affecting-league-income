Commissioner Roger Goodell said today that the labor dispute
with players is already affecting revenue for the most-watched
television sport in the U.S.  “The impact of not having a labor agreement is already
starting,” Goodell said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. “It will continue to grow. It will continue to have
a greater and greater impact, and my point in that there will be
lost revenue opportunities. And when revenue is reduced, it’s
even harder to reach an agreement.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
