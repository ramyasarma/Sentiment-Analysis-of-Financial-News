Airline earnings will shrink next
year after peaking at $8.9 billion in 2010 as austerity measures
and slower growth reduce demand and a flood of new planes hurts
pricing power, the  International Air Transport Association  said.  Profit will probably decline to $5.3 billion in 2011, IATA
Chief Executive Officer  Giovanni Bisignani  said in Singapore,
adding that while the group has tripled its 2010 earnings
forecast, margins are “razor thin” and below previous peaks.  “This year is as good as it gets in the cycle,” Bisignani
told reporters today. “Governments are running out of cash,
unemployment remains high and business confidence is weak. The
real question is how long we see the recovery lasting.”  IATA doubled its 2010 profit target for the Asia-Pacific
and raised its forecast for North America as Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd. and Delta Air Lines Inc. add passengers and cargo,
while predicting that European carriers including British
Airways Plc will lose a combined $1.3 billion.  “The economic environment is still extremely risky and
uncertain going forward,”  Brian Pearce , IATA’s chief economist,
said today. “In Europe, we’ve seen the markets are getting very
worried about government debt in some countries. And we don’t
really know what impact the austerity budgets will have.”  Price Pressure  Capacity is likely to increase 6 percent next year as 1,400
new aircraft are delivered, outpacing a 5 percent rise in demand
and depressing load factors, a measure of seat occupancy, which
will in turn will keep yields or prices “flat,” IATA said.  That contrasts with this year, in which “disciplined”
management has limited seating increases to 7 percent as traffic
surges 11 percent, helping airlines to fill 78 percent of seats
in the first seven months and producing a likely 7.3 percent
jump in full-year yields, up from a prior target of 4.5 percent.  Ticket prices still remain about 8 percent below the level
reached in 2008, according to the Montreal-based trade group,
which represents about 230  carriers  worldwide.  The airline industry has lost money in seven of the past
nine years, racking up losses of more than $50 billion.  Global sales will climb to $560 billion in 2010, $15
billion more than previously forecast but less than the $564
billion achieved in 2008, IATA said. The forecast profit is also
$4 billion lower than the figure for the pre-slump year of 2007.  “The recovery has been stronger than anyone predicted, but
a reality check is in order,” Bisignani said today. “The
industry outlook grows weaker in 2011.”  Backwards Step  Asia-Pacific carriers  will likely post a $5.2 billion
profit in 2010, compared with a prior forecast of $2.2 billion,
IATA said, with earnings sliding to $3 billion in 2011. North
American airlines will make $3.5 billion, up from an estimated
$1.9 billion, dwindling to $1.4 billion the following year.  Earnings will total $400 million among Middle Eastern
carriers, four times more than the earlier estimate, slipping to
$300 million in 2010, and $1 billion in Latin America, falling
to $600 million. Only in Europe, where the 2010 loss forecast
was pared from $2.8 billion, does IATA anticipate a better year
in 2011, with a forecast that airlines will return to breakeven.  IATA’s pessimism may be overdone, said  Jonathan Wober , an
airline analyst at Societe Generale SA in London.  “I would take a longer view,” said Wober, who forecasts
that airline profits will peak in 2015. “We’ve usually seen
upswings last a number of years, and if you believe that
economic growth will remain essentially healthy it’s difficult
to see the industry falling back into loss-making territory.”  Gene Huang , chief economist at FedEx Corp., said cargo
shipments will be spurred by “very robust growth” in trade
involving emerging markets, including higher domestic demand and
linkages within Asia. In more advanced economies, “the pace of
recovery is moderate,” he said in an interview in Hong Kong.  Oil prices will average $79 a barrel this year and should
remain constant in 2011, IATA said. Fuel expenditure, accounting
for 25 percent of the industry’s costs, will total $137 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
