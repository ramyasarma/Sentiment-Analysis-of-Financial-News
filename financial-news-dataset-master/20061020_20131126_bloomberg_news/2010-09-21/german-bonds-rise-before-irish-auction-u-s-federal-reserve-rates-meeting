German bunds rose as investors
sought the safest European fixed-income assets after Portuguese
and Irish 10-year bond yields reached the highest since 1997
yesterday on concern they may struggle to fund their deficits.  Thirty-year German bonds also advanced as Spain, Greece and
Ireland prepared to sell debt today. Concern that peripheral
euro-area nations may need to seek financial aid escalated as
Ireland’s central bank governor said yesterday the nation should
cut its budget deficit at a faster pace. The U.S. Federal
Reserve meets today amid speculation it may prepare investors
for additional purchases of securities to boost growth.  “German government bonds should remain in demand,”  Viola Stork , an economist at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in
Frankfurt, wrote in a client note today. “Rumors about Ireland
becoming insolvent have recently led to uncertainty and the risk
premiums for government bonds of troubled euro-zone countries
have increased.”  The 10-year yield fell 1 basis point to 2.46 percent as of
8:45 a.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security maturing in
September 2020 rose 0.08, or 80 euro cents per 1,000-euro
($1,308) face amount, to 98.215. The 30-year yield also fell 1
basis point, to 3.07 percent.  Investors are shunning the debt of so-called periphery
nations on renewed concern banks in the region may require
further government aid as the nations take steps to rein in
their budget deficits. Greece abandoned attempts to auction
bonds in April and turned to the European Union and
International Monetary Fund for aid.  Irish Sale  Ireland is scheduled to sell as much as 1.5 billion euros
of bonds maturing in 2014 and 2018 at auction today. Greece
plans to sell 300 million euros of 13-week bills and Spain is
due to auction as much as 7 billion euros of bills due in 12 and
18 months.  The yields on Irish bonds due to be sold today are “very
good,”  Willem Buiter , Chief Economist at Citigroup Inc. said in
an interview with Dublin’s RTE Radio today. “People should
realize that Ireland isn’t Greece and get the stuff.”  Ireland hasn’t sounded out Europe’s bailout fund for
financial aid,  Klaus Regling , chief executive officer of the
European Financial Stability Facility, told Germany’s
Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview. It’s taking the “right
measures” to tackle its deficit, European Commission President
 Jose Barroso  said in an interview yesterday.  The Irish 10-year yield fell 6 basis points to 6.47 percent
while the Portuguese 10-year yield was 1 basis point higher at
6.43 percent. The Iberian nation is due to sell up to 1 billion
euros of bonds tomorrow.  Portugal’s budget deficit widened in the first eight months
of the year, rising to 9.19 billion euros from 8.74 billion
euros a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
