Jacques Chirac  will stand trial
early next year on charges he created fictitious jobs as mayor
of Paris, even after the former French president settled civil
claims stemming from the affair, his lawyer said.  “Mr. Chirac will face trial, most likely in January or
February,” attorney  Jean Veil  said in a telephone interview
from Paris today. A judge will set the date on Oct. 1.  Chirac denies any wrongdoing amid allegations he handed out
21 City Hall job contracts for work done for his  Union for a
Popular Movement  party when he was mayor. Excluding a two-year
hiatus when he served as prime minister, Chirac was mayor of
Paris from 1977 to 1995, when he was elected president.  The civil agreement with Paris, which involved Chirac and
the UMP paying 2.2 million euros ($2.9 million) to the city,
wasn’t an admission of guilt, Veil said.  “The agreement settles the civil case, it doesn’t settle
the penal case,” he said. “He’s preparing his case.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
