China said Japan’s detention of a
Chinese ship captain over a collision in disputed waters has
“severely hurt bilateral relations.”  It is “obviously not suitable” for Chinese Prime Minister
Wen Jiabao to meet with Japanese counterpart Naoto Kan when both
leaders attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York
given the situation, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said
today in Beijing.  She reiterated China’s demand that Japan return the
captain, who is being held after his boat crashed into two
Japanese Coast Guard vessels in the East China Sea near islands
claimed by both countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
