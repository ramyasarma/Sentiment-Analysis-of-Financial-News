Primedia Ltd., the owner of South
African radio stations and a movie cinema chain, sold its 40
percent stake in Kaizer Chiefs back to the soccer club’s
founder, Kaizer Motaung, for an undisclosed sum.  Primedia sold the stake to focus on its main businesses,
Primedia Chief Executive Kuben Pillay said in a statement posted
on Kaizer Chiefs’ website today. Johannesburg-based Primedia,
which also owns an outdoor advertising business and operates
websites, was bought out by managers and the Mineworkers
Investment Co. Ltd. in 2007.  Kaizer Chiefs, started in 1970 by Motaung, has 14 million
supporters in South Africa and in 1997 sold the stake to
Primedia for 40 million rand, the South African Press
Association reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
