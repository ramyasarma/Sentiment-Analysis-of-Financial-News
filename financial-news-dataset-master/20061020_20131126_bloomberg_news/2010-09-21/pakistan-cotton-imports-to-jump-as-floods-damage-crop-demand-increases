Pakistan, the world’s third-largest
cotton user, may import as much 50 percent more of the fiber
this year as the nation’s worst-ever floods destroy crops and
textile demand increases, an industry official said.  Imports may reach 3 million bales, compared with about 2
million last year, according to Muhammad Arshad, a vice
president at the Pakistan Central Cotton committee, a
government-supported organization.  Output  may drop to 12.5
million bales, below last year’s total of 12.7 million bales and
a pre-flood forecast of 14.1 million, he said.  “Excess rains and insects have destroyed some crops,”
Arshad said today in an interview at an industry conference in
Lubbock, Texas. “Pakistan will import from India, U.S., Brazil
and maybe from a few African countries. Also, demand in Pakistan
is on the rise.”  Flooding since July 22 caused $7 billion of damage,
according to Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani . Reduced output
from Pakistan, the fourth-largest producer, and China, the top
grower and importer, has helped fuel a 36 percent jump in New
York cotton prices during the past two months, reaching a 15-
year high of $1.0237 a pound today.  Consumption in Pakistan may rise about 3 percent to 15.5
million bales, Arshad said. A bale weighs 170 kilograms (375
pounds) in the Asian nation.  Global cotton inventories will fall to 45.4 million bales
in the year to July 31, the lowest level in 14 years, according
to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Bales measured by the
USDA weight 218 kilograms.  Cotton is planted in Pakistan between April and June, and
harvested between October and December. Pakistan produced a
record 14.4 million bales in 2005.  The U.S. is the biggest exporter, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
