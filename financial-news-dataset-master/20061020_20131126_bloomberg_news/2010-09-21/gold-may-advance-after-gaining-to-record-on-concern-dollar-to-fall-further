Gold fluctuated near a record in
New York as a weaker dollar and concern the U.S. may signal
further moves to stimulate growth in the world’s largest economy
boosted demand for the metal.  Futures reached a record $1,285.20 an ounce yesterday. The
dollar approached a five-week low against the euro today on
concern the Federal Reserve will affirm its pledge to keep
interest rates low for an “extended period” and signal it’s
open to increasing debt purchases. Reports this week may show
the U.S. housing market remains fragile. Holdings in gold-backed
exchange-traded products reached an all-time high yesterday.  “The market holds strong not least on the expectation of a
prolonged dollar weakness, especially in case the Fed renews its
asset purchase program and the economy gets yet another
liquidity boost to avert a stagnating recovery,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London.  Gold futures for December delivery added as much as $3.10,
or 0.2 percent, to $1,283.90 an ounce and traded at $1,281.30 at
7:32 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices swung between a gain
of 0.2 percent and a loss of 0.4 percent. Bullion for immediate
delivery in London was little changed at $1,278.73 an ounce,
after reaching an all-time high $1,283.80 yesterday.  The metal slipped to $1,278.75 in the morning “fixing” in
London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,279.25 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. The dollar fell as
much as 0.7 percent against the euro today. Gold and the
greenback usually move inversely.  Outperforms  Gold, up 17 percent this year, is heading for its 10th
consecutive annual gain in London, the longest winning streak
since at least 1920. Bullion has outperformed global equities,
Treasuries and most industrial metals, prompting record
investments in gold-backed ETPs. The metal rallied as central
banks and governments maintained low borrowing costs and spent
trillions of dollars to stimulate their economies.  Bullion priced in British pounds today reached the highest
level since July 1, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Fed will keep its benchmark rate at between zero and
0.25 percent at today’s meeting, where it has been since
December 2008, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Fifty-four of 63
economists surveyed said the central bank will leave unchanged a
sentence saying high unemployment and low inflation warrant
“exceptionally low” rates.  Confidence among U.S. homebuilders in September
unexpectedly held at the lowest level in more than a year, a
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index showed
yesterday. A Commerce Department report today will show growth
in housing starts slowed to 0.7 percent in August from 1.7
percent the month before, a survey showed.  U.S. ‘Nervousness’  “The main thing is just a continuing nervousness about the
U.S. economy,” MineLife Pty Senior Resource Analyst  Gavin Wendt 
said by phone from Sydney. Investors are concerned that the
nation may take stimulus measures that would boost inflation and
devalue the dollar, he said.  Still, prices have gained this year even as U.S. inflation
slowed. Bullion is traditionally bought as a hedge against
rising consumer prices. Inflation expectations, based on the  10-
year  U.S. Treasury breakeven rate, have fallen to 1.80 percent
from 2.19 percent six months ago.  Global holdings  of gold by ETPs gained 4.35 metric tons to
a record 2,088.5 tons yesterday, according to Bloomberg data
from 10 providers. Holdings are up 16 percent this year.  Silver for December delivery in New York lost 0.1 percent
to $20.78 an ounce. The metal reached $21.025 on Sept. 17, the
highest price since March 2008, and is up 23 percent this year.  Platinum for October lost 0.5 percent to $1,623.40 an
ounce. Prices reached $1,634.40 yesterday, the highest level
since May 19. Palladium for December declined 1.5 percent to
$534 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
