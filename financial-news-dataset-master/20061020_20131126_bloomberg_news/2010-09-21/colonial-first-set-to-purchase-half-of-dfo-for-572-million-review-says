Colonial First State’s property arm
is likely to buy half of Australian shopping center chain Direct
Factory Outlet for A$600 million, the Australian Financial
Review reported, without saying where it got the information.  Direct Factory Outlet’s parent, Austexx, is trying to cut
debt, the newspaper said. Fund manager Colonial may make the
purchase through the CFS Retail Property Trust, and an accord 
may be completed as early as next week, the Review said.        To contact the reporter on this story:
