Bank of America Corp . promoted
 Sonia Dula  to head its Latin American wealth-management
business, succeeding  Brian Sepe , who is retiring after 31 years
with the Merrill Lynch brokerage.  Dula, who joined Merrill Lynch in 2006 to head Latin
American investment banking, was at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
from 1986 to 1995 and also worked for private media companies,
spokeswoman Danielle Robinson said. At Goldman Sachs, she
advised on the privatization of Telefonos de Mexico SAB and the
IPO of Grupo Televisa SA, and her clients included billionaire
 Carlos Slim ’s group of companies, Robinson said.  Dula, who will be based in New York, will report to  Sallie Krawcheck , president of the bank’s global wealth and investment-
management unit, and  Andrea Orcel , executive chairman of global
banking and markets and president of emerging markets outside of
Asia. Her successor as head of Latin American investment banking
excluding Brazil will be named shortly, the bank said.  Dula’s experience in investment banking “will allow us to
continue improving the way our businesses work together as
one,” Krawcheck and Orcel said in a statement from the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company.  Sepe, who is based in Miami, joined Merrill Lynch as an
adviser in 1979 and was named to head the U.S. Northeast
division in 2008. He was named head of wealth management in
Latin America in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
