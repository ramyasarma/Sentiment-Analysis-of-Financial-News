Italian voter confidence in the
government led by Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  fell this
month to the lowest since the general election in 2008, an IPR
Marketing  poll  showed.  Confidence in the Cabinet declined to 34 percent from 37
percent in July, when the last survey was carried out, Rome-
based IPR said. Berlusconi’s standing was at 39 percent, the
same level as in July and the lowest since he won his third
election in April 2008, the survey showed.  Gianfranco Fini , co-founder of Berlusconi’s  People of
Liberty , defected from the party in July and formed a new
political grouping called  Future and Freedom for Italy  that
promised to continue supporting the government. Berlusconi, who
will be 74 at the end of this month, said his parliamentary
majority will survive and that his government will serve out its
term until 2013.  “The majority’s long crisis doesn’t look to have benefited
the center-left opposition,” IPR said in an e-mailed statement.
Among the main parties, only the  Northern League , Berlusconi’s
key ally in the administration, and the Union of Centrists,
which backed his government between 2001 and 2006, increased
their support among voters, IPR said.  The monthly  poll  is carried out over the phone on 1,000
adults. The findings have a 2.5 percent margin of error. This
month’s survey was conducted between Sept. 15 and Sept. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
