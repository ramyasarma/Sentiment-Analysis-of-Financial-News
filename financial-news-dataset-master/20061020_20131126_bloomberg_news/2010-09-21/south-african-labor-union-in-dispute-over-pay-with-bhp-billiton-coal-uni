A pay dispute between  BHP Billiton
Ltd.’s  South African coal unit, one of the nation’s largest
producers, and the National  Union of Mineworkers  will go to
mediation after talks ended without agreement, the union said.  The NUM will meet with the Commission for Conciliation,
Mediation and Arbitration, an independent dispute resolution
body, today to discuss the matter, said Paris Mashego, the
union’s chief negotiator, by phone from Johannesburg.  “Our mandate is flexible, and our demands are
negotiable,” he said. “We don’t want a strike. It’s too costly
to the unions and the workers, but if management don’t come to
their senses, we will give them a strike.”  South Africa’s Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa’s largest
coal-export facility, shipped about 61.14 million metric tons of
the fuel last year, mainly to Europe. Anglo American Plc, BHP
and Xstrata Plc are the largest coal producers in the country.  The NUM is asking for a 10 percent wage increase while BHP
is offering 8.5 percent, the union said. The inflation rate in
Africa’s largest economy slowed to 3.7 percent in July from 4.2
percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
