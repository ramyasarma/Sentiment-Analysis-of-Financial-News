Hitachi Ltd.’s  hard-drive unit
plans to raise as much as $1 billion in a U.S. initial public
offering and has hired six banks to manage the sale, two people
familiar with the plans said.  Hitachi Global Storage Technologies will use New York-based
 Citigroup Inc. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Morgan Stanley; Bank of America Corp. of Charlotte, North
Carolina; and Nomura Holdings Inc. in Tokyo to manage the sale,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
information isn’t yet public.  Masayuki Takeuchi , a Tarrytown, New York-based spokesman
for Hitachi, declined to confirm that the company is planning an
initial offering.  “An IPO is one of many choices, and we’re continuing to
explore various possibilities for business growth in hard
drives,” he said by telephone today.  The IPO was previously reported by Reuters. Tokyo-based
Hitachi is Japan’s  third-largest company  by revenue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
