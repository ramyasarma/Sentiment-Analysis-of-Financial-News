The approval of pending free-trade
accords with South Korea, Colombia and Panama would help create
jobs in the U.S., said agricultural trader Cargill Inc., the
largest closely held company in the U.S.  “Cargill absolutely supports the free-trade agreements,”
Devry Boughner, director of international business relations for
Cargill, said today in a telephone interview. “The sense of
urgency comes around the state of the economy. Trade is about
creating American jobs.”  President Barack Obama’s export advisory group recommended
on Sept. 16 that the government complete work on pending accords
with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. Obama has laid out a goal
of doubling U.S. exports to about $3.1 trillion by 2015,
supporting 2 million additional jobs. The U.S. unemployment rate
rose to 9.6 percent last month.  The U.S. Trade Representative’s office signed agreements
with South Korea and Panama in June 2007 and with Colombia in
November 2006. The accords must be sent to Congress and then to
the President for approval.  “We’ve had three trade agreements that have been
languishing,” Boughner said. “If we sit back while other
countries are gaining access to these markets, we are tying our
hands behind our back.”  Boughner said an approved agreement with South Korea would
be the “most commercially meaningful” since the North American
Free Trade Agreement.  “Korea is a big opportunity on the food and agriculture
side,” she said.  Cargill employs about 61,000 employees in the U.S. and
131,000 employees in total in 66 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
