Sugar fell for a second day in
London on reduced concern about supply of the sweetener from
Brazil, the world’s biggest producer. Coffee prices rose.  Rain is forecast for most of next week in Brazil, mainly in
the southeastern states that produce most of the nation’s sugar
cane, Joel Widenor, director of agriculture services at
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said
yesterday.  “Rainfalls are expected to reduce fears of production
losses in Brazil after a long dry spell,”  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said by e-mail today.  White, or refined, sugar for December delivery dropped
$12.50, or 2.1 percent, to $595.30 a metric ton at 12:14 p.m. on
NYSE Liffe, erasing a gain of as much as 0.6 percent. Prices
touched $595. Raw sugar for March delivery slid 2.3 percent to
22.55 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Adverse weather in recent months pointed to “lower-than-
previously-expected production” for Brazil and Australia,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report on Sept. 17.  Coffee rose on concern about weather before harvesting of
the main robusta crop starts in Vietnam, the world’s largest
grower of the variety.  Making forecasts now about the Vietnamese harvest is
“hard,” said Pham Dinh Khai, director of An Giang Coffee Co.’s
branch in Buon Ma Thuot in Dak Lak, the nation’s principal
growing region. The Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association has yet
to make an estimate of production.  ‘Weather Watch’  Robusta coffee for November delivery gained $4, or 0.2
percent, to $1,658 a ton on NYSE Liffe after touching $1,668.  “It’s a complete weather-watch season at the moment,”
said  Andrea Thompson , an analyst at researcher CoffeeNetwork in
Belfast, Northern Ireland. “Once you start getting a flow of
crop and indications of crop size, it’s likely to limit any
gains and put a cap on the market.”  Vietnam will produce about 20 million bags of coffee this
year, the same as the prior year, CoffeeNetwork estimates.  Arabica coffee for December delivery advanced 0.7 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $1.8265 a pound on ICE after four days of
declines.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to 1,858
pounds ($2,883) a ton in London. December-delivery cocoa dropped
0.8 percent to $2,693 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
