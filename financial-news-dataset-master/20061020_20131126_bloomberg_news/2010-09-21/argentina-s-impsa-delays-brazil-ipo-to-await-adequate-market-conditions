Industrias Metalurgicas Pescarmona
SA, the Argentine power-plant equipment manufacturer, delayed a
planned initial public offering in Brazil until “market
conditions are adequate,” a company spokeswoman said.  A formal period established by the Brazilian securities
commission for the IPO “expired, but the company has all the
paperwork ready to restart the process when market conditions”
improve,  Pia Dollera , a Buenos Aires-based spokeswoman for the
company known as IMPSA, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions. She didn’t provide further details.  Luxembourg-based Venti SA, IMPSA’s parent company,
commented on the IPO delay in a filing today with Brazil’s
securities commission. IMPSA, a privately held company with
offices in 11 countries, builds and operates wind farms and
hydroelectric plants in the Americas and Asia.  The expansion into Brazil, Latin America’s largest country,
would make the Argentine company less vulnerable to domestic
economic swings and increase access to funding, Fitch Ratings
has said. Brazil will generate about 65 percent of IMPSA’s
revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization this year, up from 25 percent in 2009, according to
the Fitch Ratings statement  published on IMPSA’s website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
