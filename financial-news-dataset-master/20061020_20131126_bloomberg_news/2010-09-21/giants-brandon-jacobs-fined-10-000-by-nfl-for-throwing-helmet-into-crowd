New York Giants running back
 Brandon Jacobs  was fined $10,000 by the National Football
League for throwing his helmet into the stands.  In the third quarter of the Giants’ 38-14 loss to the
Indianapolis Colts two days ago, Jacobs removed his helmet
and threw it in frustration. The 28-year-old Jacobs said he
intended to hit the bench, but the helmet got stuck on his
leather glove and sailed six rows behind the Giants’ bench.
No one in the stands was injured,  ESPN  reported.  “I want to apologize one more time for accidentally
tossing my helmet in the stands,” Jacobs said today in a
statement. “It was something that happened because I was
frustrated with the game, and I had no business tossing my
helmet in the first place.”  Last season, Jacobs and  Ahmad Bradshaw  split carries
for the Giants. Bradshaw, 24, has emerged as the starting
running back this season, amassing twice as many carries
and three times as many yards as Jacobs through the team’s
first two games.  “I have not demanded a trade and have no plans to
demand a trade,” said Jacobs, who signed a four-year, $25
million contract in February 2009. “The only demand I am
making right now is of myself, to be the best player I can
be and to help this team win.”  Jacobs has scored 43 touchdowns in his six-year career
with the Giants. He rushed for 1,009 yards in 2007 and
1,089 yards in 2008. He had 835 yards rushing in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
