UniCredit SpA Chief Executive
Officer Alessandro Profumo said some shareholders have decided
to replace him, la Repubblica reported, citing unnamed sources
at the bank.  Profumo said he came back from the U.S. over the weekend
and “discovered some shareholders had decided to replace me,”
according to la Repubblica. “I’m an inconvenient presence, I’m
not part of the system,” the Italian daily reported that
Profumo said.
