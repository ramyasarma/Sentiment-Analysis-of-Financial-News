AirAsia X Sdn., the long-haul unit
of Southeast Asia’s biggest discount airline, said it will start
service to Tokyo in December, including one-way flights from the
Japanese capital to Kuala Lumpur for 5,000 yen ($58).  The unit of  AirAsia Bhd . is also considering adding service
to the Japanese cities of Osaka, Fukuoka and Sapporo, Azran
 Osman Rani , chief executive officer of the carrier, told
reporters today in Tokyo.  AirAsia is increasing flights and its fleet to take
advantage of a rebound in travel demand. The company faces
challenges from  All Nippon Airways Co. , which is also boosting
international flights and adding a discount carrier, as Tokyo’s
Haneda airport opens a new runway this year.  AirAsia rose 2.4 percent to 2.14 ringgit as of 12:30 p.m.
in Kuala Lumpur. All Nippon fell 1 percent to 309 yen as of 2:25
p.m. in Tokyo.  China’s  Spring Airlines  started flights to Japan earlier
this year, while  Qantas Airways Ltd. ’s budget unit Jetstar
already flies between Japan and Australia and rival  Japan
Airlines Corp.  is considering setting up a low-cost carrier.  Air Asia Chief Executive Officer  Tony Fernandes  said he is
seeing “tremendous growth” at the airline. Fernandes, speaking
in an interview in Singapore, reiterated that the airline will
add between eight and 12 planes a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
