European Commission President Jose
Barroso said Greece is on track to achieve its deficit-cutting
goals.  “Greece is making a huge effort,” Barroso said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in New York yesterday.
“They have been successful.”  The European Union and the International Monetary Fund
“have recognized that they are on track to meeting their
targets” for cutting the deficit, Barroso said. “But it will
take some time,” he said. “It will be an effort over several
years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
