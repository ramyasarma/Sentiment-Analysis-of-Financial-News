Former U.S. President  Bill Clinton 
said today he has collected 246 pledges for more than $2.5
billion to alleviate poverty in the developing world and help
women and girls.  Among the pledges made at the sixth annual gathering of the
 Clinton Global Initiative  in New York was a promise by the U.S.-
based aid group Americares to build a safe haven for 1,000
adolescent girls in earthquake-ravaged Haiti, to protect them
from sexual assault.  “This is a huge deal,” Clinton said as he opened the
event, which coincides with a gathering of world leaders at the
United Nations General Assembly.  Eric Schmidt , chief executive officer of  Google Inc ., which
runs the most popular Internet search engine and the video-
sharing site YouTube, pledged $1 million to help Pakistan
recover from the floods that devastated the country last month.  The donation from the Mountain View, California-based
company includes a Web-based computer application that helps
rescuers find people missing in natural disasters.  Procter & Gamble Co ., the world’s largest consumer products
company, will distribute 2 billion packets of its water
purification product Pur for free in developing countries, CEO
 Bob McDonald  said on stage.  Clinton said the packets from the Cincinnati-based
manufacturer would save at least one life every hour.  “We think it’s good business as well as good
philanthropy,” McDonald said. “Consumers around the world
today want to know what they are buying into when they spend
dollars to buy our products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
