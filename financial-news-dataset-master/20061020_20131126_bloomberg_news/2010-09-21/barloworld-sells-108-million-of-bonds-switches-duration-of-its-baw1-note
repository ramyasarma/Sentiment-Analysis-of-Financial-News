Barloworld Ltd. , the world’s
largest forklift dealer, sold 770 million rand ($108 million) of
bonds and switched a further 230 million rand of existing debt
into longer-term securities to diversify its repayment schedule.  Barloworld sold three-, four-, and seven-year debt and
switched 146 million rand of existing 10.7 percent bonds due
July 2011 into three-year securities and 84 million rand into
seven-year notes, Absa Capital, which arranged the transaction,
said in an e-mailed statement today. The transaction was the
first public corporate bond switch auction in South Africa, Absa
Capital said.  The goal of the transaction is “to lengthen and distribute
the Barloworld maturity profile as well as to rebalance the mix
between our short-term and long-term debt,”  Don Wilson , finance
director at Johannesburg-based Barloworld, said in the
statement.  South African companies are boosting bond issues and
repaying existing debt with issues of new securities to take
advantage of record low borrowing costs. The country’s benchmark
money market rate, the three-month  Johannesburg Interbank Agreed
Rate , slid to a record low of 6.035 percent today, the lowest
since the central bank introduced it  repurchase rate  in 1999.  The transaction included 425 million rand of debt maturing
Oct. 2, 2017; 275 million rand of securities due Oct. 2, 2014,
and 300 million rand of notes due Sept. 15, 2013, Prasanna Nana,
head of Absa’s debt capital markets unit, said in a telephone
interview.  The sale of 2017 bonds included 334 million rand of debt
priced to yield 260 basis points more than three month Jibar
rate and a further 91 million rand of 9.94 percent bonds priced
to yield 238 basis points above government bonds due the same
year, said Nana. The issue of 2014 bonds was divided into 200
million rand of bonds yielding 185 basis points more than three-
month Jibar and 75 million rand of 8.73 percent bonds priced
against same-maturing government debt, she added.  The 2013 bonds included 230 million of notes priced to
yield 170 basis points above the three month Jibar rate and 70
million rand of 8.31 percent notes priced to yield 141 basis
points above government’s 7.5 percent bond due January 2014,
according to Nana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
