British lawmakers next month plan
to examine whether to extend daylight saving hours to save
energy, the cross-party  Energy and Climate Change Committee 
said.  The panel, which scrutinizes government policy on reducing
greenhouse gases, electricity generation and transportation
fuels, will hold an evidence session on Oct. 28, it said today
in an e-mailed statement.  The committee, led by  Tim Yeo , a lawmaker from the ruling
Conservative Party, called for organizations and individuals to
submit evidence on how extending so-called British Summer Time
beyond its current mid-spring to mid-fall range would impact
energy usage and what effect it would have on achieving U.K.
targets to boost renewable energy.  Daylight saving time this year began on March 28 and ends
on Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
