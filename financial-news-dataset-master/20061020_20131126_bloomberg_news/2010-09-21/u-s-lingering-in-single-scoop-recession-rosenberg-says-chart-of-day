The U.S. economy hasn’t recovered
from a “single-scoop recession,” said  David Rosenberg , chief
economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates in Toronto.  “Everyone has this view that growth will merely be slow
but that there will be no double dip,” Rosenberg wrote in a
research report published yesterday. “Nobody seems to entertain
the notion that we may still be in a recessionary state.”  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, which fell to a one-year
low of 66.6 in September from August’s 68.9, according to
figures released on Sept. 17. That was worse than even the most
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “That is why this is more likely a ‘single-scoop’
recession than a ‘double dip’,” wrote Rosenberg, whose firm
manages $5.4 billion. “We likely never fully emerged from the
one that began in late 2007.”  The U.S. recession ended in June 2009, the National Bureau
of Economic Research said in a statement yesterday. Rosenberg
wrote that the consumer sentiment index is not only 24 points
below the average consistent with a growing economy, it is still
seven points below “what is typical of actual recessions.”  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the writer of this column:
