Garrett Hartley ’s 37-yard field
goal as time expired lifted the New Orleans Saints to a 25-22
victory over the San Francisco 49ers.  After San Francisco tied the score 22-22 with a touchdown
and two-point conversion,  Drew Brees  drove the Saints 54 yards
in the final 1:19 to set up Hartley’s winning kick at
Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Brees’s 30-yard completion to
 Marques Colston  with 20 seconds remaining moved the Saints to
the 49ers’ 23-yard line.  The Super Bowl-champion Saints improved to 2-0 with the
win, while the 49ers fell to 0-2. There are eight unbeaten
National Football League teams through the first two weeks of
the regular season.  “(I’m) real proud of us coming back there at the end and
finding a way to pull this one out,” Saints coach  Sean Payton 
said during a news conference.  Brees threw for 254 yards and had touchdown passes to
running back  Reggie Bush  and tight end  David Thomas . Bush, in
his first game since he relinquished the Heisman Trophy he won
in 2005 while at the University of Southern California, was
helped off the field with a right leg injury with seven minutes
to play. The extent of the injury wasn’t immediately known.  Frank Gore  had two rushing touchdowns for the 49ers,
including a 7-yard run with 1:19 left that pulled San Francisco
within 22-20. On the two-point conversion attempt,  Vernon Davis 
was initially ruled to have been stopped short of the end zone
after catching a pass from  Alex Smith . The on-field ruling was
overturned after an instant replay review.  The 49ers held a 417-287 advantage in total offensive yards
and finished with seven more first downs than the Saints.  San Francisco also had four turnovers, including three
within the New Orleans 30-yard line, and a snap that sailed over
Smith’s head that led to a safety 1:32 into the game.  “It’s very hard to win games in this league when you’re
turning the football over,” 49ers coach  Mike Singletary  said
during a news conference. “We have to learn how to protect the
football consistently.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
