Eight officials in the Southern
California city of Bell were arrested in an investigation of
high salaries that the managers of the Los Angeles suburb were
reported to have paid themselves.  Los Angeles County District Attorney  Steve Cooley  announced
the arrests today at a news conference.  The arrests follow Los Angeles Times reports that  Robert Rizzo , Bell’s manager, earned almost $800,000 a year and that
part-time City Council members took home almost $100,000
annually, mostly by serving on municipal boards and commissions.
Rizzo and two other top officials have since resigned.  California Attorney General  Jerry Brown  sued Rizzo and
seven other officials on Sept. 15, accusing them of wasting
public funds, negligence, fraud, conflict of interest and breach
fiduciary duty.  “This is not an arrest necessary to accomplish a law
enforcement goal of bringing charges,” Rizzo’s attorney, James
Spertus, said in a phone interview before the news conference.
“This is an arrest done for political reasons because I have
offered to facilitate Mr. Rizzo’s first appearance if it ever
became necessary.”  Bell, located about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of
Los Angeles, has a largely Latino population of 38,000. The
city’s latest annual report put per-capita income at $24,800 in
2008. Statewide, the figure was almost $42,700 that year,
