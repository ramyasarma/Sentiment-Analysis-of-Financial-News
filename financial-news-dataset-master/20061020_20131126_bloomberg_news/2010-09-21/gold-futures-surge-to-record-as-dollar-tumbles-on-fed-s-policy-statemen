Gold futures rose to a record after
the Federal Reserve signaled it would keep interest rates low
for an extended period, sparking a slump in the dollar.  The metal surged to $1,292.40 an ounce at 3:55 p.m. New
York time after the Fed said it’s willing to ease monetary
policy further to bolster the economy. The  greenback  fell as
much as 1.3 percent against a basket of six major currencies.
Gold has gained 18 percent this year, heading for the 10th
straight annual gain.  “The economy is still very fragile, and the key here is
that the Fed is fully prepared for additional accommodation and
ready to go out and buy more debt to help this economy sputter
along,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures
Group in Chicago. “The dollar is getting kicked, and gold is
running higher.  Gold futures for December delivery traded at $1,291.10 at
3:58 p.m. in after-hours trading on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the contract settled at $1,274.30 in floor trading,
down $6.50.  The metal fell as low as $1,272 at 2:14 p.m., around the
time of the Fed statement.  Gold for immediate delivery rose to a record $1,291.  The metal, a traditional store of value, has rallied this
year amid tame inflation. Inflation expectations, based on the
 10-year  U.S. breakeven rate, have fallen to 1.8 percent from 2.2
percent six months ago.  Recovery ‘Slowed’  Fed policy makers said that the pace of recovery and job
growth have “slowed in recent months.” They also said that
“measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels
somewhat below those the committee judges most consistent, over
the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment
and price stability.”  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent and purchased mortgage-backed securities
and Treasuries to help bolster the economy.  “We have the chairman of the Federal Reserve opening the
door to another round of quantitative easing, willing to
depreciate the value of our currency and destroy our purchasing
power at an even greater rate,” said  Michael Pento , a senior
economist at Euro Pacific Capital in New York. “Of course gold
is going to rally in this environment.”  Silver for immediate delivery jumped 32.27 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $21.05 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $21.075,
the highest level since March 17, 2008.  Earlier, spot silver dropped as much as 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
