The Czech Finance Ministry is
considering buying back state bonds worth as much as 60 billion
koruna ($3.2 billion) before maturity in the next two years,
according to a draft law.  The plan would allow the ministry to sell new bonds to
obtain funds for buying state securities from the market before
their maturity to the tune of 30 billion koruna each year in
2011 and 2012, a draft law posted on a state website gathering
legislative proposals, showed today. Finance Ministry spokesman
Jakub Haas confirmed the document was authentic.  Finance Minister  Miroslav Kalousek  requested the government
to debate the bond program, which also includes selling
securities to cover maturing debt in the next two years, at the
Cabinet meeting scheduled for Sept. 29, the draft law showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
