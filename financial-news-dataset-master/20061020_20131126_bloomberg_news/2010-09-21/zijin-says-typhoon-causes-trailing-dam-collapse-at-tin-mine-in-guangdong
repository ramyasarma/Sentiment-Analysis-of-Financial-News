Zijin Mining Group Co. said
torrential rain and mud and rock slides caused by typhoon Fanapi
triggered the collapse of a tailing dam today at the company’s
Yinyan Tin Mine in Xinyi city, Guangdong, China.  Power, communication and transport are “suspended” at the
mine site, the company told Hong Kong’s stock exchange this
evening. Emergency relief work is in progress, it said.  The company said it hasn’t received any reports of
casualties and due to communication problems is yet to get full
information. The mine is in trial production, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
