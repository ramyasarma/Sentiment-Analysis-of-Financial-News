Discontent with the Labor Party in
Western Australia is at its highest since 1996 as support rose
for Liberal Premier Colin Barnett and his state government,
according to an opinion survey.  Voter support for the Liberal Party and Nationals, who
formed an alliance government after the 2008 state election, is
47 percent, while 30 percent want Labor in power, the Newspoll,
published in the Australian newspaper showed. The Liberal-
National alliance has a 14-percentage-point lead over Labor on a
two-party preferred measure at 57 percent, up from an 8-point
lead in April-June, the telephone survey of 842 people between
July and September showed. Support for Barnett as premier hit a
record 61 percent, while 17 percent backed Labor opposition
leader Eric Ripper, according to the survey that has a 3.5-
percentage-point margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
