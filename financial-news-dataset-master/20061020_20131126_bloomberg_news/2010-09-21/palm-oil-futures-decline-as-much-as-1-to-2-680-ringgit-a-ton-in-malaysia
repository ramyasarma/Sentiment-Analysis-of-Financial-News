Palm oil dropped for the first
time in three days as some investors bet the rally to the
highest level in more than a month was overdone.  December-delivery futures declined as much as 1 percent to
2,680 ringgit a metric ton ($864) on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and was at 2,691 ringgit at 3:02 p.m. local time. The
most-active contract surged 3.1 percent to 2,708 ringgit
yesterday, the highest level at close since Aug. 13, as
concerns that weather may curb harvests prompted funds to buy
commodities including corn, cotton and soybeans.  “There’s a bit of profit-taking after yesterday’s
rally,” said  Veeresh Hiremath , an analyst at Karvy Comtrade
Ltd. “The market may reverse direction in the second half as
soybeans and soybean oil are trading firm.”  Soybeans jumped to a 15-month high in intraday trading
yesterday as a cold snap threatens crops in China, the biggest
consumer of the oilseed. Freezing weather this week in
northeastern China will reduce crop quality and output, after
rains delayed planting, according to T-Storm Weather Inc.  “Any damage to the Chinese crop will increase its
dependence on imports and that will drive up prices of oilseeds
and palm oil,” Hiremath said.  December-delivery soybean oil traded in Chicago added as
much as 0.5 percent to 43.27 cents a pound, while November-
delivery soybeans climbed as much as 0.8 percent to $10.93 a
bushel. The oilseed reached $10.995 a bushel in intraday
trading yesterday, the highest level since June 2009.  Yield Boost  Palm oil has rebounded 19 percent from an eight-month low
on July 7 on speculation that demand will increase from Asian
countries celebrating festivals and that harvesting in Malaysia
and Indonesia will be disrupted in November and December if La
Nina causes flooding in growing areas.  Malaysia aims to boost average palm fresh fruit bunch
yields to 26.2 tons per hectare from 21 tons, according to an
exhibition today in Kuala Lumpur by the government’s
Performance Management and Delivery Unit, or Pemandu.  On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, palm oil for delivery in
May dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 7,510 yuan ($1,120) a ton,
and closed at 7,596 yuan. May-delivery soybean oil fell as much
as 1.6 percent to 8,306 yuan a ton and closed at 8,398 yuan.  CME Group Inc.’s December-delivery palm oil contract,
which pegged to the Malaysian benchmark, lost as much as 0.5
percent to $867.5 a ton in Singapore. The commodity reached
$871.50 a ton yesterday, the highest since the exchange began
trading the contract in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
