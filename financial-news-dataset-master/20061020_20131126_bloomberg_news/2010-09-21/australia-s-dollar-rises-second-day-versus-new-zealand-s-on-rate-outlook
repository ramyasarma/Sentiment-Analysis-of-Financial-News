The Aussie climbed to 95 U.S. cents
for the first time since July 2008 after minutes of the Reserve
Bank’s meeting said Australia is likely to need higher interest
rates if the bank’s forecast for growth is realized.  New Zealand’s dollar dropped against its Australian
counterpart as investors reduced speculation that the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand will raise borrowing costs after this
month’s earthquake.  “Should the RBA hike rates over coming months, then a rise
to 96.50 cents is in the cards,” said  John Kyriakopoulos , head
of currency strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney.  Australia’s currency traded at 94.76 U.S. cents at 11:43
a.m. in New York, compared with 94.72 cents yesterday. It
touched 95.02 cents, the highest level since July 2008. New
Zealand’s dollar dropped 0.1 percent to 72.97 U.S. cents and
slid 0.2 percent to NZ$1.2987 per Australian dollar.  While the bank remains “alert” to risks such as weaker
global growth, “members considered that if the central scenario
came to pass it was likely that higher interest rates would be
required, at some point,” the Reserve Bank of Australia said in
minutes of its Sept. 7 meeting released in Sydney today.  The RBA raised borrowing costs in six quarter-percentage-
point steps from October to May, taking the benchmark overnight
cash rate target to 4.5 percent.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand left its  overnight cash
rate  unchanged at 3 percent on Sept. 16 after raising it in June
and July. The central bank cut its building and inflation
forecasts and said the Sept. 4 earthquake in Christchurch may
reduce growth by 0.3 percentage point this quarter.  There’s a 2 percent  chance  the Reserve Bank will boost
rates at its next meeting on Oct. 28, down from 4 percent,
according to an index compiled by Credit Suisse Group AG.  “Local fundamentals will not warrant a significantly
stronger New Zealand dollar,” said  Khoon Goh , head of market
economics and strategy in Wellington at ANZ National Bank Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
