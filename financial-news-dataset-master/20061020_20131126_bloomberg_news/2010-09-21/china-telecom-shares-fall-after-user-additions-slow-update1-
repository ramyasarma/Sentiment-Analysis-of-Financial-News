China Telecom Corp. , the country’s
biggest fixed-line phone carrier, had its biggest decline in
almost four months in Hong Kong after adding fewer new mobile-
phone users last month.  The company  dropped  3.5 percent to close at HK$4.13, the
biggest decline since May 25. The stock has gained 27 percent
this year, compared with a 0.6 percent advance for Hong Kong’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  China Telecom added 2.6 million mobile-phone users in
August, compared with 2.8 million the previous month, the
company said after the close of trading yesterday. That was the
smallest monthly gain since August 2009, according to data on
the Beijing-based carrier’s website.  The company this year started offering new handsets,
including  Research in Motion Ltd. ’s BlackBerry, to lure
consumers and compete with  China Mobile Ltd. , the world’s
biggest phone operator by  market value , and  China Unicom (Hong
Kong) Ltd. , the only Chinese carrier selling Apple Inc.’s
iPhone. China Telecom has more than 179 million fixed-line users
and almost 80 million mobile-phone subscribers.  China Mobile  shares  rose 0.1 percent to HK$79.50 in Hong
Kong, while Unicom shares gained 1.7 percent to HK$12.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
