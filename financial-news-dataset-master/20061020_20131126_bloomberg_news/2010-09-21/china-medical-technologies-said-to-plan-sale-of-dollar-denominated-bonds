             China Medical Technologies Inc. ,
which makes devices for tumor treatments, plans to sell bonds
denominated in U.S. dollars, according to a person familiar with
the matter.  
 Deutsche Bank AG and Standard Chartered Plc are managing
the sale, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the details are private. The company is planning a
series of investor meetings from tomorrow, the person said.  
 China Medical last sold bonds in 2008 when it raised $276
million from 4 percent convertible bonds due in 2013, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings said they will rank the new debt B+, their fourth-
highest non-investment-grade ratings.  
 China Medical has  fallen  7.7 percent to $12.97 in New York
trading this year. The stock rose 0.9 percent yesterday.
