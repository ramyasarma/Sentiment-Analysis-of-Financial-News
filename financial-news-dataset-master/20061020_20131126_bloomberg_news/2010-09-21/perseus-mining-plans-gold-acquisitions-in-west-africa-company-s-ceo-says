Perseus Mining Ltd. , an Australian
gold company building a mine in Ghana, plans to make
acquisitions in West Africa from next year.  “If we don’t get swallowed, we’ll use our early stage
production to our advantage” to take part in consolidation once
revenue from the mine starts flowing in the third quarter next
year, Managing Director  Mark Calderwood  said in an interview.
Perseus hasn’t had any recent takeover approaches, he said.  UBS AG yesterday named Perseus and  Adamus Resources Ltd. 
as potential targets partly because of their West African
projects. Gold’s climb to a record this year has pushed
acquisitions in the sector to an all-time high, with Kinross
Gold Corp.’s C$7.4 billion ($7.2 billion) takeover of Red Back
Mining Inc., the latest in West Africa.  Perseus  slipped 1 cent to A$3.24 at 2:43 p.m. in Sydney.
Its shares have jumped 83 percent this year.  Perseus, based in Perth and with a market value of A$1.37
billion ($1.29 billion), is developing the $160 million Central
Ashanti gold project in southern Ghana and the Tengrela project
in Ivory Coast. Central Ashanti is set to start output in the
third quarter next year, with average production of 275,000
ounces a year over 13 years, UBS said.  The company already has a 19.9 percent stake in Burey Gold
Ltd., an exploration company that focuses on Guinea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
