(Corrects GDP figure in fourth paragraph of story
originally published Sept. 21.)  Azerbaijan, the third-largest
energy producer among former Soviet republics, may move to a
managed floating exchange rate for the manat as the economy
improves, according to central bank Chairman Elman Rustamov.  The manat was pegged to the dollar in March 2009 to protect
the nation’s financial stability as demand for U.S. currency
increased during the global credit crisis, according to the
central bank. The bank aims to keep the manat stable at 0.803
manats per dollar this year, Rustamov, 58, said.  “If macroeconomic conditions allow, we are ready to move
to a managed floating exchange rate,” he said Sept. 16 in an
interview in Baku. “But first there needs to be an assessment
of the current account balance, the government’s fiscal
situation and the real economy.”  Azerbaijan’s economy may expand between 4 percent and 5
percent this year, compared with 9.3 percent growth in 2009,
Rustamov said. North Sea Dated Brent crude, the benchmark for
Azerbaijan’s oil, has averaged $77.06 a barrel this year, 37
percent more than in the same period last year.  Higher prices for oil, which makes up 93 percent of the
Caspian Sea nation’s exports, will also boost the country’s
current account surplus after it fell by 38 percent to $10.2
billion last year. The current account is the broadest measure
of international trade and money flows.  “We are considering these issues, but there is no doubt
that a stable exchange rate must be supported as an important
factor for financial stability,” said Rustamov, who has been
chairman of the central bank since 1995.  Stable Exchange Rate  The central bank will maintain the peg this year because
there is pressure for the manat to appreciate and a stronger
currency would put too much strain on the non-oil economy as the
country recovers from recession, Rustamov said. He declined to
comment when asked whether the central bank might move toward a
managed float in 2011.  The manat has gained 12.5 percent against the dollar since
Azerbaijan redenominated its currency in January 2006 at a rate
of 1 new manat for every 5,000 old manats.  The government plans to gradually increase spending next
year as oil production stabilizes at around 50 million tons
annually, according to Rustamov. Oil production rose to 50.4
million metric tons last year from 44.5 million tons in 2008,
according to the Azeri State Statistical Committee. Gas output
was little changed at 16.33 billion cubic meters.  Azerbaijan’s international reserves will probably rise to
$6.5 billion in 2010 and $8 billion in 2011, after dropping as
low as $4.9 billion in July 2009, he said.  Annual inflation will accelerate to as much as 10 percent
this year before slowing to between 7 percent and 8 percent in
2011, Rustamov said. The central bank plans to control inflation
by maintaining a stable exchange rate and increasing debt sales
to remove excess liquidity from the economy, he said.  “Inflation is at a satisfactory level for us,” Rustamov
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
