             E.ON AG has written to U.K. Energy
Secretary Chris Huhne to protest against remarks he made last
week at a House of Commons committee hearing suggesting a
rejection of a proposed consumer-funded levy to support new
British nuclear stations, the London-based Times reported.  
 Volcker Beckers, chief executive officer of RWE npower Plc,
 E.ON’s joint venture partner in a planned U.K. nuclear project,
also sought clarification of the remarks from officials in
Huhne’s Department of Energy and Climate Change, the newspaper
said, without saying where it got the information.  
 Both companies are partners in Horizon Nuclear Power, which
aims to spend 15 billion pounds ($23 billion) building nuclear
reactors in the U.K. At the committee meeting, Huhne backed a
proposal from EDF SA to establish a “carbon floor price,” to
improve the competitiveness of nuclear power over more-polluting
coal and gas power plants, the Times said.  
 RWE and E.ON are said to believe the comments contradict
arguments they have presented to Huhne since the general
election in May, the newspaper said.
