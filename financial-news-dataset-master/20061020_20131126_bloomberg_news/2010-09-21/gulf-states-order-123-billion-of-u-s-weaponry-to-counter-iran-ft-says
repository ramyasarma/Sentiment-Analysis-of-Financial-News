Arab states around the Persian Gulf
have ordered U.S. weapons systems worth a total of $123 billion
“to counter Iran’s military power,” the Financial Times
reported.  The biggest slice of this is a $67.8 billion package for
Saudi Arabia, including 85 new F-15 jet fighters and the
upgrading of another 70; the first phase, worth about $30
billion, goes before the U.S. Congress for approval soon and a
later agreement is likely to include improvement of radar and
missile defense systems and modernization of the Saudi fleet,
the newspaper said.  The United Arab Emirates has signed contracts to buy
military kit worth $35.6 billion, the FT said, citing Theodore
Karasik, of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military
Analysis, in Dubai. The orders include a high-altitude missile
defense system called Thaad that’s being developed by Lockheed
Martin Corp., the newspaper said.  Oman is likely to spend $12.3 billion and Kuwait $7.1
billion by the end of 2014 on replacing and upgrading aircraft
and on new command-and-control systems, the FT said, citing
Blenheim Capital Partners, a consulting firm that arranges
offset transactions.  Oman’s purchases will include 18 new F-16 fighters and
upgrades for another 12, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
