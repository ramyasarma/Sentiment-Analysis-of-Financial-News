HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire” was
renewed for a second season after the organized crime drama’s
debut episode attracted the network’s largest audience for a
premiere in more than six years.  The Sept. 19 debut drew an average of 4.8 million viewers,
HBO, owned by  Time Warner Inc. , said today in an e-mailed
statement. The first episode at 9 p.m. drew the largest audience
since the debut of “Deadwood” in March 2004.  “Boardwalk Empire,” created by “Sopranos” writer
 Terence Winter  and co-directed by  Martin Scorsese , is set in
Atlantic City in the 1920s at the start of Prohibition, when
alcohol sales became illegal in the U.S. The show features  Steve Buscemi  as Nucky Thompson, the town treasurer and liquor-dealing
gangster, and  Michael Pitt  as Jimmy Darmody, a young man just
returned home from World War I.  The premiere topped the first episode of HBO’s “True
Blood,” which was seen by 1.4 million viewers two years ago. It
fell short of the 5.8 million viewers who tuned in for
“Deadwood,” which aired immediately after “The Sopranos,”
HBO said.  Including two additional airings Sept. 19, “Boardwalk
Empire” was watched by a combined 7.1 million viewers its first
night, HBO said.  Time Warner, based in New York, fell 5 cents to $31.86 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares
have gained 9.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
