             Narita International Airport Corp.
registered to sell as much as 200 billion yen ($2.3 billion) of
bonds, according to a filing today with Japan’s finance
ministry.  
 The registration takes effect Sept. 29 and is valid for two
years. A shelf registration allows for bond sales without
obligating the company or country to borrow.
