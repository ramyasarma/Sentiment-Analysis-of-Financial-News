Iran’s parliament outlined policies
aimed at countering United Nations sanctions over the country’s
nuclear program, the head of the body’s economic committee said.  Changes in policies relating to transportation, trade and
foreign exchange are among those under consideration, Arsalan
Fathipour said, without giving details, the state-run  Press TV 
news channel reported.  Fathipour said the suggestions will be conveyed soon to the
speaker of the parliament,  Ali Larijani , according to a report
published late yesterday on the channel’s website.  The UN in June passed a fourth round of sanctions against
Iran that restrict financial transactions. The U.S. on July 1
passed additional sanctions targeting fuel importers and banks,
and European Union governments followed by banning investment
and sales of equipment to Iran’s oil and natural-gas industries.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said Sept. 19 that
UN-backed sanctions are “biting” Iran’s economy, especially
its financial sector.  “The Iranian regime is quite worried about the impact,”
Clinton said in an interview on  ABC’s “This Week”  program.  Iranian officials have played down the sanctions’
effectiveness and say the measures won’t influence the country’s
nuclear program.  Supporters of sanctions worry that Iran may be trying to
develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s government says it seeks to
harness nuclear power for civil use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
