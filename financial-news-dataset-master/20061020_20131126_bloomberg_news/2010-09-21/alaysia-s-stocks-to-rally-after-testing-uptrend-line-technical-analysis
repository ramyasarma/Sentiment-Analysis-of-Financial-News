             Malaysia’s benchmark  stock  index
may surpass its intraday record 1,524.69 in January 2008 after
holding above the uptrend line, defying concerns it’s most
“overbought” in more than a decade, OSK Research Sdn. said.  
 The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  will scale a new high as
long as it stays above the uptrend line, drawn by connecting the
closing points of the “major lows” for the gauge, said  Shin Kao Jack , an OSK analyst. The gauge gained 0.2 percent to
1,469.69 at the close yesterday.  
 “The possibility of a new record will be there if the
trend remains as it is,” he said in an interview in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday, declining to give a time frame for the new
record. “As long as the trend is up and the index is above the
trend line, stocks will continue to go higher.”  
 The measure’s 14-day  relative strength index , an indicator
of momentum, climbed to 86.4 on Sept. 14, the highest point
since Jan. 18, 2000, when it reached 87.1. Readings over 70
suggest a stock is overbought and the price is vulnerable to a
slide.  
 The Malaysian index, Southeast Asia’s second-best performer
in the past month, has  surged  17 percent since its May 26 low.  
 The  KLCI’s  immediate resistance lies at the psychological
1,500 barrier, followed by the 1,524.69 record, Shin said.
“Despite the market’s current overbought condition, it can
still stretch its gains further,” he said.  
 OSK Research’s Shin correctly predicted on April 16, 2009,
the  benchmark  may surpass 1,000 for the first time in more than
six months. He raised his forecast to 1,300 on Nov. 11, more
than two months before the index reached that level.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
