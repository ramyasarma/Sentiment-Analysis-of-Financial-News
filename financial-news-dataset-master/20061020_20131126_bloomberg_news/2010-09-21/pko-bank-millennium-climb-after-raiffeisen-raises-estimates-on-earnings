PKO Bank Polski SA , Poland’s
biggest bank, and Bank Millennium SA headed for their highest
levels in five months after Raiffeisen Centrobank AG raised its
outlook for the stocks, citing “strong” earnings prospects.  State-controlled PKO advanced for a third day, adding 2
percent to 42.75 zloty at 10:18 a.m. in Warsaw, poised to close
at the highest level since April 20.  Millennium , a unit of Banco
Comercial Portugues SA, increased 1.9 percent to 4.78 zloty.  PKO had its share-price estimate increased 8.9 zloty to 49
zloty at Raiffeisen, which maintained its “buy” recommendation
for the stock, according to a note released today. Millennium
was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at the Austrian bank, with
its price projection lifted 9.8 percent to 5.6 zloty.  The two Polish banks as well as  Erste Group Bank AG  of
Austria and BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA of Romania are among
“top picks” in central Europe at Raiffeisen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
