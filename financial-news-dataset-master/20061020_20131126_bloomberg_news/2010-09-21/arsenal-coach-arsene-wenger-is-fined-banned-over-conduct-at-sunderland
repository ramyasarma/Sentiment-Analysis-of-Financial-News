Arsenal coach  Arsene Wenger  was
suspended for one match after admitting improper conduct in the
1-1 Premier League draw at Sunderland three days ago.  He’ll serve the touchline ban at tonight’s League Cup match
at Tottenham, and as part of the standard sanction will also pay
an 8,000-pound ($12,425) fine, the Football Association said  on
its website .  He admitted “using insulting and/or abusive
language and behavior amounting to improper conduct” in his
contact with match officials.  Arsenal conceded a goal to Darren Bent in the fifth minute
of injury time and lost the chance of going top of the league.
It’s now second, four points behind Chelsea, which beat
Blackpool 4-0 the following day.  Wenger confronted fourth official Martin Atkinson at the
end of the Sunderland match, and later complained to reporters
that an excessive amount of injury time was played. A minimum of
four minutes had been indicated, and a longer period wasn’t
justified, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
