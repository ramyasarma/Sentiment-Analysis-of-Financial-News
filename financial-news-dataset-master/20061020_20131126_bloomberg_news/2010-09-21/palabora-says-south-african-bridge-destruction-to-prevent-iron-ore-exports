Palabora Mining Co. , the South
African copper-producing unit of  Rio Tinto Group , said the
destruction of a bridge in South Africa by a train derailment
will prevent it from exporting magnetite, a type of iron ore.  The incident “will consequently have an impact on sales
revenue,” the company, part-owned by Rio and  Anglo American
Plc , said today in a statement to the Johannesburg stock
exchange. The bridge on the rail line, which links Palabora’s
mining operations with the Richards Bay and Maputo ports, will
take at least five weeks to repair, it said.  Palabora exports magnetite, a by-product of its copper
operations, to China, it said on its website. The Phalaborwa-
based company is assessing the impact of the derailment and
“will be reviewing alternative options,” it said.  Palabora  shares  fell 45 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 96.49
rand at the 5 p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg, valuing the
company at 4.7 billion rand ($660 million). Rio owns 58 percent
and  Anglo American  17 percent of Palabora, while the balance is
held by other investors.  Palabora sold 2.57 million metric tons of magnetite in
2009, a 35 percent increase on the previous year, it said.
Shipments in the six months through June fell by almost 120,000
tons, or half its usual monthly deliveries, because of a strike
by workers of state-owned ports and freight rail operator,
Transnet Ltd., Palabora said on August 5. The strike lasted for
three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
