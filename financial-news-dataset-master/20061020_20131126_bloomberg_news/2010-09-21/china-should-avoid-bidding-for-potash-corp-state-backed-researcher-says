China shouldn’t bid for  Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc.  because countering  BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s $40
billion offer would cost too much and isn’t needed to secure
fertilizer supply, a state researcher said.  “If China made a counter-bid for Potash Corp. for, say,
$60 billion, potash prices would have to surge threefold to make
the investment worthwhile,” Wei Chengguang, director of the
Shanghai Potash Technology and Research Center, said in an
interview. “Who’d buy such expensive potash? The risk is
obviously too high.”  China is the second-biggest importer of potash, a crop
nutrient, and a counter bid may stop BHP increasing its grip on
the supply of raw materials to the Asian nation. State-owned
Sinochem Group has proposed paying as much as $60 billion for
Potash Corp., the Globe and Mail reported yesterday, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  “Sinochem won’t take a decision blindly” to bid for
Potash, said Wei. “China doesn’t need to worry that BHP’s
acquisition will boost the company’s” control over the supply
of commodities, he said.  China’s potash consumption may rise 4.5 percent to 7
million metric tons this year, Wei said in a Sept. 9 report,
which he said has been given to Chinese central-government
departments. Still, domestic production will meet almost 80
percent of the demand, almost the same as last year, he said.  -- Helen Yuan . Editors:  Keith Gosman ,  Andrew Hobbs   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
