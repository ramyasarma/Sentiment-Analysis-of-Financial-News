Palladium, used mostly in
autocatalysts, may rise to $600 an ounce after completing a so-
called pennant formation, according to Barclays Capital.  Immediate-delivery metal broke out of a narrowing trading
range begun in May on rising above $500 an ounce at the end of
August, said  MacNeil Curry , a technical analyst at Barclays in
New York, as shown by the attached chart. The gains mean
palladium may exceed this year’s peak of $573.40 an ounce
reached in April and then climb as high as $600, he said in a
report.  A pennant is formed when upper and lower trend lines meet
to form a triangle, and advances above the formation are viewed
as bullish.  Prices remain in an “uptrend” for palladium, and declines
since Sept. 15 are a “short-term” phenomenon, Curry said
separately by e-mail.  Palladium for immediate delivery traded at $529.50 an ounce
at 4:45 p.m. in London yesterday. Prices fell for a fourth day,
paring this year’s gain to 30 percent. The metal touched $1,125
in January 2001, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
