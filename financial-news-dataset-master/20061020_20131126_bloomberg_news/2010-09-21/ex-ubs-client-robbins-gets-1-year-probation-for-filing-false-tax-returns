Jules Robbins, a former  UBS AG 
client who pleaded guilty to five counts of filing false tax
returns, was sentenced to one year of probation.  Robbins, an 84-year-old retired watch distributor from
Jericho, New York, admitted in April that he failed to disclose
almost $42 million held in an offshore UBS account.  “I want to convey to you my most sincere apology for not
filing accurate federal tax returns,” Robbins said to U.S.
District Judge  Richard Holwell  at a hearing today in Manhattan.
“I should have disclosed my UBS account in those federal tax
returns.”  As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Robbins agreed to
pay a $20.8 million civil penalty for failing to file foreign
bank account report forms. The amount is 80 percent of Robbins’s
net worth, his lawyer,  Martin Perschetz , told Holwell. Holwell
imposed an additional $2,000 criminal fine.  Perschetz, who said that Robbins is in fragile health and
has already suffered punishment for the crime, asked Holwell for
a sentence that didn’t include prison. Robbins asked the judge
for mercy, breaking down several times as he told Holwell of the
“shame, aggravation and sleepless nights during the past many
months.”  UBS , based in Zurich, avoided U.S. prosecution in 2009 by
 paying  $780 million, turning over the names of U.S. account
holders and admitting it helped Americans hide assets from the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service.  The case is U.S. v. Robbins, 10-CR-333, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
