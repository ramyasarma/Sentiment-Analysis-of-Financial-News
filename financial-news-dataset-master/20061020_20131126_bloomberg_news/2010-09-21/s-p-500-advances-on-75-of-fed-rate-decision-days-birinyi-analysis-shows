The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has
risen on 75 percent of the days since March 2009 when the
Federal Reserve announced its interest-rate decisions, according
to  Rob Leiphart  of Birinyi Associates Inc.  The index of U.S. stocks climbed on 9 of the 12 days since
March 18, 2009, that the Fed reported its decision, rising an
average of 0.5 percent, according to a report dated yesterday by
Westport, Connecticut-based Birinyi. The Fed kept its rate
unchanged each time.  The Washington-based Fed, whose Open Market Committee is
scheduled to meet today, is likely to affirm its pledge to keep
interest rates low for an “extended period,” according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. All economists expect the
rate to remain unchanged today.  The S&P 500 has risen 47 percent since March 17, 2009.  To contact the reporter for this story:
