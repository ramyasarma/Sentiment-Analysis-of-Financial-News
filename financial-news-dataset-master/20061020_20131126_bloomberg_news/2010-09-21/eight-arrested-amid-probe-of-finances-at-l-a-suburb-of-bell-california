At least eight officials of  Bell, 
California, were arrested including  Robert Rizzo , the former
city manager who was paid almost $800,000 a year, the Los
Angeles Times  reported , citing an unidentified person familiar
with the situation.  Los Angeles County District Attorney  Steve Cooley  plans to
announce criminal charges related to the salaries paid by the
municipality, the Times said. Among those arrested were former
Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia, Mayor  Oscar Hernandez ,
council members  Luis Artiga ,  Teresa Jacobo  and George Mirabal;
and former members George Cole and Victor Bello, the paper said.  The charges are expected to be detailed at a press
conference this morning, the Times said, citing a person “with
knowledge of the case who was not authorized to comment
publicly.”  The Times reported in July that  Rizzo  earned an annual
salary of almost $800,000 and that part-time Council members
took home almost $100,000 a year, mostly by serving on municipal
boards and commissions. Rizzo and two other top officials have
since resigned.  California Attorney General  Jerry Brown  sued Rizzo and
seven other officials on Sept. 15, accusing them of wasting
public funds, negligence, fraud, conflict of interest and breach
of fiduciary duty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
