             Alinta Energy Ltd. , an Australian
electricity generator with interests in 12 operating power
stations, agreed to hand over assets to lenders to cancel A$2.8
billion ($2.6 billion) of debt.  
 Shareholders will get 10 Australian cents for each unit
under the proposal and retain ownership of an interest in the
Redbank power plant in New South Wales state, Alinta said in a
statement today. GPG Plc, the company’s largest holder with 19.9
percent, supports the plan, Alinta said in a separate statement.  
 The exchange of assets will eliminate the A$2.8 billion
debt,  Fiona Osler , a spokeswoman for Alinta said by telephone
today. There are “over 30” lenders in the group, including TPG
Capital, Osler said.  
 Alinta, formerly known as Babcock & Brown Power Ltd.,
borrowed to buy power stations and gas retailing networks,
building up debt that it described today as too high for the
company to continue operating as a going concern. The shares,
which peaked at A$3.74 in May 2007, have since lost 98 percent
of their value as Babcock Power was forced to renegotiate terms
with lenders and sell assets.  
 The stock jumped as much as 59 percent today to 9.2
Australian cents, and traded at 8.9 cents at 11:18 a.m. in
Sydney. The benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index  gained 0.4 percent.  
 While the company received trade bids for its assets, none
of them would have repaid the lenders in full and Alinta’s
borrowings are too high to continue operating without shedding
some of its debt, the company said.
