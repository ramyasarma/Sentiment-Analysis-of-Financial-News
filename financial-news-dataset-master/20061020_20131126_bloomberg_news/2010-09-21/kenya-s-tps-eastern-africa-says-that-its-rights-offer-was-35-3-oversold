TPS Eastern Africa Ltd., the Serena
Hotel chain’s Kenyan holding company, said its 1.2 billion
shillings ($14.8 million) rights offer was 35.3 percent
oversold.  The offer of 24.7 million new shares to existing holders to
help fund expansion plans attracted bids worth 1.6 billion
shillings, the company said in a statement published in the
Nairobi-based Daily Nation Newspaper.  The additional shares will begin trading on the Nairobi
Stock
 Exchange on Sept. 27, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
