Whiting Petroleum Corp. , the
Denver-based oil and gas company, is marketing debt amid concern
that surging issuance will push relative yields higher.  Whiting Petroleum may sell $350 million of eight-year
senior subordinated notes as soon as today, according to a
person familiar with the transaction who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  The extra yields that company bonds pay relative to
Treasuries have fallen to the lowest in more than four months as
investors gain confidence the economy won’t slip back into
recession. That decline may reverse after investors snapped up
the securities at the fastest pace since 2008, according to Guy
LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.  “While strong demand and liquidity benefits have helped to
sustain credit spreads in the wake of the last several weeks’
issuance, there comes a point where supply, particularly when so
concentrated, simply overwhelms demand,” LeBas wrote in a note
to clients yesterday. “We see a bias towards wider credit
spreads in the back half of September.”  The extra yield investors demand to own high-yield, high-
risk debt climbed 1 basis point to 625 basis points yesterday,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield
Master II Index. Spreads on the bonds have tightened 67 basis
points this month and touched 624 basis points on Sept. 17, the
narrowest since May 13, the data show.  Whiting Ratings  High-yield debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds shrank 1 basis
point to 183 basis points, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index. That’s the tightest
since May 18, the index data show.  Whiting Petroleum’s notes are expected to be assigned a
rank of B1 by Moody’s Investors Service and BB, two steps
higher, by Standard & Poor’s, said the person.  Charter Communications Inc. issued $1 billion of seven-year
notes and AbitibiBowater Inc. raised $850 million after

offering to lead $8.9 billion in investment-grade corporate bond
