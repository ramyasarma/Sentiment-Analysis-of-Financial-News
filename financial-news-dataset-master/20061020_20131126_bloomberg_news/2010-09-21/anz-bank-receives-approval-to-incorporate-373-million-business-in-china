             Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. , Australia’s third-largest lender by market value,
said it got approval from China’s banking regulator to become
locally incorporated in the country.  
 ANZ Bank’s China unit, to be established on Oct. 1, will
have 2.5 billion yuan ($373 million) of registered capital, the
Melbourne-based lender said in a statement today. The company
aims to have 20 outlets in the country in three years, up from
seven currently.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Michael Smith ’s expansion plan is
partly designed to marry a shortfall in deposits at home with a
surplus of cash in Asia. A stronger foothold in China would also
bring access to borrowers and investors in the world’s fastest-
growing major economy.  
 China opened its banking industry to overseas companies in
December 2006, sparking a rush among foreign lenders to compete
for the nation’s corporate and household savings, which reached
$7.6 trillion in July.  
 Foreign banks must become locally incorporated in the
nation to offer services such as yuan-denominated bank cards,
retail banking and underwriting of short-term corporate bonds.  
 ANZ Bank will focus on institutional and corporate banking
rather than the mass-market sector, Smith said at a press
conference in Shanghai today.  
 ANZ Bank  fell 0.5 percent to A$23.85 at 1:04 p.m. in Sydney.
The stock has climbed 4.2 percent this year, compared with a 4.9
percent decline in the  S&P/ASX 200 index .  
 The Australian lender plans to increase the proportion of
profit generated in the Asia-Pacific region to 20 percent by
2012 from the current 14 percent.  
 Smith also said ANZ Bank is still conducting due diligence
on Korea Exchange Bank, the lender put up for sale by Lone Star
Funds.
