Swiss stocks fell, led by Lonza
Group AG after BofA-Merrill Lynch Global Research advised
selling shares in the world’s biggest maker of drug ingredients.       Cie. Financiere Richemont SA  and  Swatch Group AG 
limited declines in the  Swiss Market Index  after the country’s
watch makers federation said that Swiss watch exports rose 24.1
percent in August.  The  SMI  dropped 41.58, or 0.6 percent, to 6,420.4 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Zurich, falling for the fifth day in six. The
measure gained 8.1 percent from this year’s low on July 5 to
yesterday’s close as concern abated that efforts by European
governments to scale back spending may tip the continent’s
economy into recession. The broader Swiss Performance Index was
lost 0.5 percent today.  Investors today await comments from U.S. Federal Reserve
policy makers in the U.S. as to whether it will introduce
measures to boost economic growth.  Basel, Switzerland-based  Lonza , whose shares have gained 18
percent in 2010, lost 1.9 percent to 86.50 Swiss francs.  “We see further upside as unlikely and believe there may
be downside risk to our and consensus forecasts for 2011-12
given high growth expectations in light of slowing economic
growth,” Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a report today, as
they cut their recommendation on Lonza to “underperform” from
“neutral.”  SGS Declines  SGS SA, the biggest goods inspector, dropped 3.3 percent to
1,638 francs after yesterday posting its biggest advance in more
than two weeks. The gains pushed the shares above a Relative
Strength Index level of 70, a threshold that indicates to
followers of the technical indicator that a security is
“overbought” and poised to drop.       Richemont , Switzerland’s largest jewelry maker, added
0.9 percent to 45.50 francs, the shares’ third advance.  Swatch ,
the maker of Omega and Breguet watches, rose 0.5 percent to
365.50 francs, also a third straight gain. Swiss watch exports
grew 24.1 percent last month, led by demand from Hong Kong, the
U.S. and France, data from the Federation of the Swiss Watch
Industry showed today.  Kaba Holding AG  jumped 3.5 percent to 330 francs, the
stock’s highest price since June 2008. Helvea SA raised its
recommendation on shares of the provider of mechanical and
electronic security systems to “buy,” citing a “sustainable
higher operating margin going forward.” Helvea upgraded its
price-estimate on the shares to 450 francs from 300 francs
previously.  Holcim Ltd., the world’s second-biggest cement maker, rose
1.1 percent to 65.05 francs. Analysts at UBS AG reiterated their
“buy” recommendation on the shares after the company’s
management hosted a two-day investor day in St. Louis, U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
