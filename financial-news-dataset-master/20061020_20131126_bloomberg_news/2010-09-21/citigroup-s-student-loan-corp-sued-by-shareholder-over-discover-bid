Citigroup Inc. ’s  Student Loan Corp. 
was sued by a shareholder who contends he will be shortchanged
in a planned $600 million acquisition by  Discover Financial
Services .  Student Loan, based in Stamford, Connecticut, said Sept. 17
it would be bought by Discover for $30 a share, a 40 percent
premium over the previous day’s close.  The bank, which owns 80 percent of Student Loan, “is in
desperate need to raise cash and divest non-core banking assets
in the short term,” and the deal is “underpriced,” Alan R.
Kahn said in a complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington.  More than a score of Citigroup businesses were identified
for sale following the New York-based bank’s $45 billion bailout
in 2008.  The takeover will make Discover, based in Riverwoods,
Illinois, the third-largest U.S. provider of private student
loans, behind leader  SLM Corp.  and  Wells Fargo & Co.   Kahn said directors of Student Loan are violating their
duties to get the best price, and asked a judge to stop the
buyout and grant the case class-action, or group, status on
behalf of all outside shareholders.  “We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we intend
to vigorously defend our position,”  Mark Rodgers , a Citigroup
spokesman, said in an e-mailed message.  Student Loan fell 5 cents to $29.88 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at 3:17 p.m. The shares have declined
36 percent this year.  The case is Kahn v. The Student Loan Corp., CA5832,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
