Israel’s  unemployment rate  fell in
July to the lowest in almost two years as the economy expanded.  The jobless rate declined to 6.2 percent from 6.3 percent
in the previous month, the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of
Statistics said today on its website. In July last year,
unemployment was 7.7 percent.  “There is a very positive trend here,” said  Vered Dar ,
chief economist at Tel Aviv-based Psagot Investment House Ltd.,
before the announcement. “Not only are we seeing a drop in
unemployment, there is also an increase in labor participation,
and this is very good news.”  Israel’s economy has bounced back from the global crisis
faster than many developed countries. The economy will probably
expand 4.1 percent this year, powered by exports, consumer
spending and home construction, the Central Bureau of Statistics
said Sept. 6. In 2009, growth was 0.8 percent.  Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 stock index  surged more than 20
percent in the past 12 months, led by  Avner Oil Exploration LP ,
Isramco Negev 2 LP and Delek Drilling-LP, three of the partners
in gas fields off Israel’s coast.  Dar said she expects the decline in  unemployment  to level
off in the coming months, due to both the slowdown in the U.S.
and the fact that Israel is approaching full employment levels.  “The slowdown in growth hasn’t reached Israel yet, but it
will,” she said. “Growth will be slower in the fourth quarter
and in the first two quarters of next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
