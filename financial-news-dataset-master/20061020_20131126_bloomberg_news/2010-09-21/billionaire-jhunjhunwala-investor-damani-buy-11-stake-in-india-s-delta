Billionaire  Rakesh Jhunjhunwala  and
investor Radhakrishna Damani bought an 11 percent stake in
India’s Delta Corp., Chief Financial Officer  Hardik Dhebar  said
in a phone interview today.  Shares of Delta, a Mumbai-based group with interests in
real estate, casinos and aircraft charter services, rose as much
as 10 percent to their highest since January 2008</a>.  The company plans to set up three new casinos in India,
Dhebar said. “We want to expand our imprint in the region,” he
said. “We realize that it is Asia that is going to drive growth
as far as discretionary and leisure spending is concerned. India
is a large unexplored gaming market.”  Delta  shares  rose 7.9 percent to 75.3 rupees as of 1:31 p.m.
in Mumbai. The stock has advanced 65.7 percent this year
compared with a 14 percent gain for the  Sensex .  Forbes magazine ranks Jhunjhunwala 937 on its list of the
world’s billionaires with a net worth of $1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
