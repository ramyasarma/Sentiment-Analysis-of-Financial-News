Canada’s currency rose against its
U.S. counterpart after the Federal Reserve said it’s willing to
ease monetary policy further to boost the economy, spurring
demand for assets that benefit from global growth.  “Prepared to ease further equals cheap money, which spurs
growth,”  John Curran , senior vice president at CanadianForex
Ltd., an online currency dealer in Toronto, said via e-mail.
“Risk on.”  The loonie, as the currency is sometimes known, dropped
earlier after a report showed inflation unexpectedly fell in
August, raising speculation that Bank of Canada will pause in
its cycle of interest-rate increases when policy makers meet
next month.  The Canadian dollar rose as much as 0.6 percent to C$1.0217
per  U.S. dollar  and traded at C$1.0264 at 4:43 p.m. in Toronto,
from C$1.0282 yesterday. It reached C$1.0216 on Sept. 14, the
most since Aug. 6. One Canadian dollar buys 97.43 U.S. cents.  The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee was expected to

0.1 percent in August, and rose 1.7 percent from a year ago
following July’s 1.8 percent gain. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the price index would be unchanged during
August and the annual rate would accelerate to 1.9 percent, the
median of 16 estimates.  Government Bonds  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  has increased interest
rates three times since June to 1 percent from 0.25 percent, and
said Sept. 14 the country’s recovery will be “slightly more
gradual” than expected earlier this year. Policy makers next
meet on Oct. 19.  The 2-year note’s yield fell 5 basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.45 percent. The price of the 2 percent
