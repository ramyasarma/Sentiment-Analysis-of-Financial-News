What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on speculation that rains may aid
winter-crop planting in parts of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and
the southern U.S. Great Plains, said  Bill Biedermann , a senior
vice president for Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 1 cent a bushel
lower in Chicago as mostly dry, warm U.S. Midwest weather in the
next two weeks speeds up the harvest, adding to supplies,
Biedermann said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that increased demand for animal feed and vegetable
oil will lead to a jump in U.S. exports, Biedermann said.
Soybean-meal futures may open $1 lower to $1 higher per 2,000
pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open steady to 0.1 cent a
pound higher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
