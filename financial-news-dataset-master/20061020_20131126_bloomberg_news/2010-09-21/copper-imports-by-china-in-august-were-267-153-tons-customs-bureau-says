             Imports of refined copper by China,
the largest consumer, gained for the second consecutive month
in August, as traders ordered material to benefit from a
profitable arbitrage window.  
 Inbound shipments totaled 267,153 metric tons last month,
the General Administration of Customs said in an e-mailed
report today. That’s 19 percent higher than 224,723 tons in
July and 22 percent more than 219,731 tons a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  
 “It was profitable to import in early June, mid-June, and
early July.” said Li Ye, an analyst at Shanghai Jiuheng
Futures Co. “This is in line with our expectations.” Traders
in China bought the metal in London and sold it in Shanghai to
reap profits by differences in prices between the two markets.
Shipping usually takes up to one-and-a-half months.  
 Copper stockpiles in Shanghai monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange have fallen almost 50 percent since the end of
April, and demand usually picks up in autumn on seasonal demand,
prompting Chinese trading firms to place orders.  
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange settled at $7,715 a ton yesterday, and was unchanged
at 10:53 a.m. in Shanghai.
