European bonds rose as Ireland sold
1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) of securities and speculation
mounted the Federal Reserve will signal it’s open to increasing
purchases of U.S. debt.  Irish bonds snapped a six-day decline and Spanish and Greek
debt advanced after the nations auctioned a total 8.9 billion
euros of notes and bills. German 10-year securities gained
before the Fed announces its decision on interest rates. The
extra yield investors demand to hold Ireland’s bonds instead of
bunds tumbled after climbing above 4 percentage points for the
first time yesterday.  “Clearly the concession helped the auctions but it does
augur well for a more positive move and more convergence”
between periphery bonds and German bunds, said  Padhraic Garvey ,
head of developed-market debt strategy at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam. “The Greek bill was particularly positive with
yields at less than 4 percent.”  The Irish 10-year bond yield fell 17 basis points to 6.37
percent as of 4:35 p.m. in London, narrowing its premium over
bunds to 384 basis points from 401 basis points yesterday. The
4.5 percent security maturing in April 2020 rose 1.055, or 10.55
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 86.86.  Debt issued by so-called periphery nations slumped last
week on renewed concern banks in the region may require further
government aid as the nations take steps to rein in their budget
deficits. Greece abandoned attempts to auction bonds in April
and turned to the European Union and International Monetary Fund
for aid.  ‘Right Measure’  Ireland hasn’t sounded out Europe’s bailout fund for
financial aid,  Klaus Regling , chief executive officer of the
European Financial Stability Facility, told Germany’s
Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview. It’s taking the “right
measures” to tackle its deficit, European Commission President
 Jose Barroso  said in an interview yesterday.  Ireland sold bonds maturing in 2014 and 2018 today, while
Spain sold 7 billion euros of 12-month and 18-month bills, the
maximum target. Greece sold 390 million euros of 13-week bills
at a yield of 3.98 percent.  The yield on the Spanish 10-year bond fell 3 basis points
to 4.22 percent and the Greek 10-year yield dropped 27 basis
points to 11.34 percent.  Ireland sold 1 billion euros of 2018 securities at a yield
of 6.023 percent, up from 5.088 percent in June, the National
Treasury Management Agency in Dublin said.  “For investors this is great but for the government and
the taxpayers it is horrible,” said  Willem Buiter , chief
economist at Citigroup Inc., in an interview today.  ‘Vast Bulk’  The “vast bulk” of the Irish securities sold today went
to overseas investors,  Oliver Whelan , head of funding at the
NTMA, said on a conference call.  Portugal’s 10-year yield fell 9 basis points to 6.33
percent. The nation is scheduled to sell as much as 1 billion
euros of debt due in 2014 and 2020 tomorrow. Its budget deficit
widened in the first eight months of the year, rising to 9.19
billion euros from 8.74 billion euros a year earlier, the
Finance Ministry said yesterday.  Germany is scheduled to sell 6 billion euros of five-year
bonds tomorrow and Ireland plans to auction as much as 500
million euros of bills on Sept. 23.  German bunds rose , with the 10-year yield falling 2 basis
points to 2.45 percent. The Fed will affirm its pledge to keep
interest rates low, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. It may use a statement accompanying its rates
decision to prepare investors for additional purchases of debt
this year, according to  Richard Clarida  of Pacific Investment
Management Co., which runs the world’s biggest bond fund.  ‘Inspire Optimism’  “German government bonds should remain in demand,”  Viola Stork , an economist at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in
Frankfurt, wrote in a client note today. The Fed’s “comments
should not inspire optimism about the economy.”  Yields on government bonds of Greece, Spain, Ireland and
Portugal will fall to within 2.2 percentage points of benchmark
German bunds on average in the next two years from 4.61
percentage points last week, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of 15 banks that trade directly with Germany’s debt
agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
