OAO Gazprom , the Moscow-based gas
export monopoly, is planning its first sale of international
debt in more than a year, joining Russian companies including
OAO Sberbank in taking advantage of lower borrowing costs.  The Moscow-based company wants to sell Eurobonds before the
end of 2010, Yana Kolosovskaya, head of loans and guarantees, 
said in an interview in London today. The sale will become 
Gazprom’s first offering of foreign-currency debt since
July 2009.  Gazprom earlier this month increased its investment plan by
13 percent to 905.2 billion rubles ($29 billion) to finance
transportation projects and developments in eastern Russia. The
company also plans to  increase  spending on the Kirinsky field
off Sakhalin Island, where it boosted gas reserves by 33 percent
this year, the Zapolyarnoye field in western Siberia and other
deposits to help compensate for declines at aging fields.  Russian banks are selling the most bonds on international
markets for any year since the government defaulted in 1998 as a
rebounding economy helps push down borrowing costs. Offerings by
Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, and Alfa Bank last week
brought total overseas debt sales by lenders in 2010 to $12.1
billion, the most by financial firms since Bloomberg began
tracking the data in 1999.  Gazprom’s debt is rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
its third-lowest of 10 investment grades, and one notch lower at
BBB by Standard & Poor’s, the same ratings assigned to the
Russian government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
