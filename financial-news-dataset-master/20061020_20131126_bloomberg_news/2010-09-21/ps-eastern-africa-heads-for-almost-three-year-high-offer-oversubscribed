TPS Eastern Africa Ltd. , the
holding company for the Serena Hotel chain, headed for the
highest close in almost three years as its 1.2 billion-shilling
($14.8 million) rights offer was 35 percent oversubscribed.  The shares rose as much as 3 percent to 68 shillings and
were trading 0.8 percent higher at 66.5 shillings as of 10:07
a.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at this level would be the
highest since Oct. 3, 2007.  The offer of 24.7 million new shares attracted bids worth
1.6 billion shillings, the company said in a statement published
in the Nairobi-based Daily Nation Newspaper. The proceeds of the
offer will be used for expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
