Rhodia SA , the French maker of
plastics and perfume ingredients, may sell $400 million of 10-
year notes to extend its average debt maturities, the company
said in an e-mailed statement.  The notes may be sold as soon as tomorrow at a yield of
about 7 percent, according to a person familiar with the
offering who declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  Proceeds will be used to redeem some of Rhodia’s
outstanding floating-rate notes maturing in 2013, the Paris-
based company said in the statement.  Credit Suisse Group AG and Credit Agricole SA are managing
the sale, the person said.  Moody’s Investors Service grades the notes B1 and Standard
& Poor’s ranks them BB, two steps higher, the rating companies
said today in separate statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
