Russia’s government may borrow as
much as $13.9 billion abroad by the end of next year, according
to Bloomberg calculations based on Finance Ministry data.  Russia’s foreign sovereign debt may reach $55.6 billion by
Jan. 1, 2012, the ministry said in a draft budget for the next
three years, which was posted on its website today. Russia’s
foreign debt was $41.7 billion on Aug. 1, ministry data show.  The government’s domestic debt at the end of 2011 will be
capped at 5.1 trillion rubles if the draft budget is adopted,
versus about 2.04 trillion rubles on Sept. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
