CME Group Inc. , the largest futures
exchange, will introduce trading in the fourth quarter in oil
and gold futures and options contracts based on volatility
indexes calculated with the Chicago Board Options Exchange.  The CBOE/Nymex WTI Volatility Index, based on New York
Mercantile Exchange oil options price data, and the CBOE/Comex
Gold Volatility Index “will give global market participants
tradable tools to express their opinions on the direction of the
volatility of the markets,” said  Bryan Durkin , CME’s chief
operating officer, in a statement.  CME plans to begin futures and options trading based on
corn and soybean volatility indexes in the first quarter of
2011, according to the statement.  The  indexes  use CME options prices and CBOE methodology.
They are the first to be introduced under a seven-year licensing
agreement between CME and  CBOE Holdings Inc. , operator of the
largest U.S. options exchange. It gives CME global rights to
list futures and options for CBOE volatility indexes for a
variety of products.  Shares of CME fell $2.98, or 1.1 percent, to $268.94 at
4:08 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
shares have fallen 20 percent this year. CBOE, which went public
in June, fell 34 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $21.52, also on the
Nasdaq. Both companies are based in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
