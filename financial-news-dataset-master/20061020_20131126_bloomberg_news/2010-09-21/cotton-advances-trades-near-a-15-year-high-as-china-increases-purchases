Cotton rose in New York, extending
a rally to a 15-year high, on demand from China, the biggest
grower and consumer, and on worsening crop conditions in the
U.S., the largest exporter.  Imports of the fiber by China doubled in the first eight
months of the year from a year earlier, according to figures
from Customs General Administration published today. The U.S.
crop was rated 58 percent good or excellent as of Sept. 19, down
from 59 percent a week earlier, the Department of Agriculture
said yesterday in a report.  “The market’s highly emotionally charged,” said  Keith Brown , the president of Keith Brown & Co., a brokerage in
Moultrie, Georgia. “The tightness is certainly legitimate.
There’s no crop coming to the rescue for the demand.”  Cotton for December delivery gained 1.42 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $1.0079 a pound at 2:40 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. Earlier, futures touched $1.0237, the highest level
for a most-active contract since June 1995. The commodity has
advanced for four straight sessions.  “The bullish story about cotton continues to drive
speculative buying,” St. Louis-based  Doane Advisory Services 
said yesterday in a report. “Cotton contracts are at price
levels reached only a few times during the past 40 years.”  Rain in China’s growing regions may cause rotting in some
unharvested bolls, World Weather Inc. President  Drew Lerner  said
on Sept. 15.  U.S. Harvest Progress  The U.S. harvest was 13 percent completed as of Sept. 19,
compared with 8 percent a week earlier and a five-year average
of 10 percent, according to the USDA.  Cotton was “the only major crop that had its
‘good/excellent’ rating changed from last week,” economist
 Dennis Gartman  said in his daily newsletter.  U.S. cotton exports to Brazil will rise to 1.1 million
bales this year, more than triple the record 335,000 bales in
1994, the USDA’s Foreign Agriculture Service said yesterday in a
report on its website.  Global cotton inventories will slump 3.3 percent to 45.4
million bales at the end of the marketing year on July 31, the
USDA forecasts. That’s equal to 38 percent of demand, the lowest
ratio since 1994. A bale weighs about 480 pounds (218
kilograms).  Through yesterday, supplies in  warehouses  monitored by ICE
have slumped 96 percent this year. Cotton futures have surged 33
percent in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
