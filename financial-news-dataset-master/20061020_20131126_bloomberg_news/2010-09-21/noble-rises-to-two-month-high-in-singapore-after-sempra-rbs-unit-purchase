             Noble Group Ltd. climbed to its
highest level in nearly two months after it agreed to buy a
retail energy unit from a joint venture between Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Sempra Energy for $317 million.  
 Noble surged 6.2 percent to S$1.90 as of 9:12 a.m. in
SIngapore, heading for its highest close since June 22. The
company is paying cash and will assume about $265 million debt
for the Sempra-RBS unit, which markets energy to commercial and
industrial customers in 16 U.S. states, it said.
