The rally in high-yield debt to
near 2010 highs may be a signal the U.S. stock market will
continue its climb until the end of the year, according to
Strategas Research Partners.  The  Barclays Capital High-Yield Bond  exchange-traded fund
bottomed in May, six weeks before the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index fell to a 10-month low on July 2. That continues a pattern
in which “credit has provided a valuable leading signal for the
equity markets over the last three years,”  Christopher Verrone ,
lead technical analyst at Strategas, said in a report today.  “Bullish things are happening under the surface and around
us,” New York-based Verrone said in an interview. “I wouldn’t
be surprised if the market challenged the high it hit in
April.”  The  S&P 500  has retreated 6.4 percent since April 23, when
the benchmark measure of U.S. stocks rallied to a 19-month high.
The high-yield ETF is within 1.2 percent of its year-to-date
peak. Verrone said this signals equities will keep rebounding.
The S&P 500 has already risen 11 percent from its 2010 low on
July 2, to 1,139.31.  “The U.S. equity market has room to play catch-up into
year-end,” Verrone said, because “groups typically associated
with U.S. equity strength” including the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index,
Korea’s Kospi Index, the Australian dollar and copper are
“breaking out” above their trading ranges from the last few
months.  Average prices on high-yield debt rose above 100 cents on
the dollar on Sept. 16 for the first time since June 2007 after
falling as low as 55 cents in December 2008, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. Junk bonds reached 100.3 cents on
the dollar as of yesterday.  Technical analysts use trading patterns and prices to
