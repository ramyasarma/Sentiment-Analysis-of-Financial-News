Hog futures climbed to a three-week
high as rising pork prices encourage U.S. meatpackers to step up
purchases as the herd declines. Cattle fell.  Spot-market  hog prices rose 1.6 percent yesterday to 80.47
cents a pound, the highest in more than a week, government data
show.  Wholesale pork  climbed to 91.87 cents, the highest since
Sept. 2. Meatpackers processed 834,000 hogs in the first two
days of this week, down 2.7 percent from the same time last
year. In June, the U.S. hog breeding herd was near the smallest
size on record, as farmer losses in 2008 and 2009 spurred culls.  “We’ve got a combination of good product prices and
limited hog supplies,” said  Lawrence Kane , a market adviser at
Stewart-Peterson Group in Yates City, Illinois. Higher prices
reflect “good exports and good product movement,” he said.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.3 cent, or 0.4
percent, to close at 77.075 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price earlier touched 78 cents,
the highest price for a most-active contract since Aug. 25, and
the highest ever for the December contract. Futures have climbed
17 percent this year.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.55 cent, or 0.5
percent, to $1.0005 a pound. Futures have gained 16 percent this
year. Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement climbed
0.075 cent to $1.11025 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
