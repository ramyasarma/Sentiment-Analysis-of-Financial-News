Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  fell as the dollar weakened against the yen after the
U.S. Federal Reserve said it’s willing to ease monetary policy,
and as oil and metal prices dropped.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. , a
Japanese carmaker that gets about 70 percent of its sales abroad,
lost 0.6 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo as the
stronger yen cut the outlook for export earnings. Those of
 Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s biggest commodities trader, slid 0.3
percent and ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s No. 1 mining
company and Australia’s largest oil producer, slid 0.4 percent
from the closing share price in Sydney.  “Investors are focused on the future of the currency
market,”  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in
assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 9,525 in Chicago yesterday, compared with

and New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  slid 0.2 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index slipped 0.3 percent yesterday in New
York as investors bought Treasuries amid speculation the Federal
Reserve will purchase more government debt to buoy the economy.  U.S. Monetary Policy  The Federal Reserve yesterday said it’s willing to ease
monetary policy further to spur growth and support prices while
refraining from expanding its holdings of securities. The Fed
reiterated that it would keep the benchmark lending rate in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent “for an extended period.”  The yen appreciated to as high as 84.98 after the Fed’s
announcement, compared with 85.57 at the close of stock trading
in Tokyo yesterday, curbing the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Crude oil for October delivery lost 1.8 percent in New York
yesterday to the lowest close since Aug. 31. The  London Metal
Exchange Index  of six metals including aluminum and copper
declined 1 percent yesterday, the biggest drop since Sept. 9.
The  Baltic Dry Index  of shipping rates for commodities sank 2.5
percent yesterday, falling for a seventh consecutive day.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has fallen 3.2 percent from its
high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and
