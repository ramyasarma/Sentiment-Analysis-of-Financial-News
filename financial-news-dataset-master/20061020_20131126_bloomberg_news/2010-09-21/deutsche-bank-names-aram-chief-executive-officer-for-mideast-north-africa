Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s biggest
bank, named  Ashok Aram  as chief executive officer for the Middle
East and North Africa, replacing  Henry Azzam , who will become
non-executive chairman for the region.  Aram moves from Dubai-based private equity company Abraaj
Capital Ltd., where he was previously managing director. He
joined Abraaj from Deutsche Bank in London in July 2009.  Aram will report to  Juergen Fitschen , a member of Deutsche
Bank’s management board, and focus on developing the company
across the region. He will manage client relationships,
implement a growth strategy and safeguard risk and capital, the
lender said in an e-mailed statement from Dubai today.  Deutsche Bank employs about 200 people in the Middle East
and North Africa region, where it offers investment-banking
services, private wealth management, asset management and global
transaction banking, according to the statement.  Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank has vaulted to second place
among advisers on bond sales in the Middle East and North Africa
from 17th two years ago, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The lender has advised on six bond sales worth $5.2
billion this year, including the $450 million issue of Dar Al
Arkan Real Estate Development Co. and the Bahrain government’s
sale of a $1.25 billion bond in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
