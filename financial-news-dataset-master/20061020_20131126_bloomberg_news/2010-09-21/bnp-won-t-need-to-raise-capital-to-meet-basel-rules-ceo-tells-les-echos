BNP Paribas SA won’t need to raise
capital to comply with rules prepared by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, Chief Executive Officer Baudoin Prot told
French daily Les Echos in an interview.  The bank will study UniCredit SpA’s Pioneer asset-
management business when it’s put up for sale, Prot said in the
interview. BNP is not interested in Deutsche Bank AG’s BHF-Bank
unit, Prot added.
