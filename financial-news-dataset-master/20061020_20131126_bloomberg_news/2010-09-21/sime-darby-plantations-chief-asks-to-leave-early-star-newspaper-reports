             Azhar Abdul Hamid, head of Sime
Darby Bhd.’s plantations unit, has requested release from his
three-year contract which is due to expire on Nov. 26, the Star
reported today, citing Azhar.  
 Azhar, who temporarily led the group earlier this year
after Group Chief Executive Officer Ahmad Zubir Murshid was
asked to take leave of absense, said he wants to resign to make
it easier for successor Mohd. Bakke Salleh to restructure the
company.
