Aluminium Bahrain BSC, which runs a
smelter in the Middle Eastern island nation, plans an initial
public offering for November or December as the company expands
production, Chairman  Mahmood Hashim Al Kooheji  said today.  Proceeds from the offering, whose size hasn’t been
disclosed, will go to shareholders, Al Kooheji said in an
interview in Manama, Bahrain. The company, owned by the Bahraini
and Saudi governments, said in June it plans to become a public
joint stock company to add financial flexibility and compete on
international markets.  “We are doing this as part of sharing the wealth with the
people of Bahrain,” Al Kooheji said. “Once we get listed, we
will be the biggest market-cap company on our stock exchange.”  Aluminium Bahrain intends to expand the capacity of its
850,000-metric-ton-a-year smelter by 400,000 tons, Chief
Executive Officer  Laurent Schmitt  said today. Construction of
the extra capacity will begin within two years of a feasibility
study, which may be completed by the first quarter of 2011, Al
Kooheji said.  The company, known as Alba, expects second-half earnings to
be similar to the $200 million it reported in the first half, Al
Kooheji said. Profit will improve next year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
