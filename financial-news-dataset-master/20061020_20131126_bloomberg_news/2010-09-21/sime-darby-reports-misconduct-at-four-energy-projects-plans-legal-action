             Sime Darby Bhd. , the world’s
biggest publicly traded palm oil producer, plans to start legal
proceedings and lodge reports with the authorities after finding
evidence of misconduct in four of its energy-related projects.  
 The company completed an audit and had evidence of
inappropriate conduct and breaches of duties and obligations, it
said in a stock exchange filing in Kuala Lumpur late yesterday.  
 “The board has been advised by legal counsel to keep
confidential the details of the report and nature of such
proceedings so as not to adversely affect the interests of the
group,” Sime Darby said.  
 The  100-year-old company  made total provisions of 2.1
billion ringgit ($677 million) in  the year  ended June 30 on oil
and gas projects in the Middle East, Sime Darby said on Aug. 26.
This included projects with Qatar Petroleum and Maersk Oil Qatar,
according to the statement.  
 Sime Darby  rose 0.4 percent to 8.33 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur
trading at 10:46 a.m. today, compared with the 0.3 percent gain
in the country’s benchmark index. The shares have fallen 7.1
percent this year, making them the  worst-performer  on the 30-
stock FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index.  
 The projects reviewed were Sime Darby’s engineering works
at the Bulhanine and Maydan Mahzam fields for Qatar Petroleum, a
Maersk Oil Qatar project including the construction of ships,
and Malaysia’s Bakun hydroelectric dam project.  
 Rubber Plantations  
 Set up in 1910 as an operator of rubber plantations, Sime
Darby has diversified into businesses ranging from cars and
ship-building to property development. It made an unsuccessful
foray into banking in the 1990s. The company sold control of
Sime Bank in 1999 after posting a  loss  of 540.9 million ringgit
the previous year, its first deficit in two decades.  
 The group will be reorganized starting Jan. 1, reverting to
a previous structure where each division would be its own
separate company, Group Chief Executive Officer  Mohd Bakke Salleh  told reporters on Aug. 26.  
 His predecessor,  Ahmad Zubir Murshid , was removed when the
company reported its first quarterly loss in more than a decade
on May 27 after cost overruns on the Middle East projects and
the Bakun dam in Sarawak.  
 “Disclosing the results of the investigation would have
gone a long way in proving to investors that Sime is serious
about being more transparent and improving its corporate
governance,”  Hoe Lee Leng , an analyst at RHB Research Institute
Sdn., said in a report today.
