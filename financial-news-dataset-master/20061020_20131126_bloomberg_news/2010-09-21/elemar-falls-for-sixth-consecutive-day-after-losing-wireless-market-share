Telemar Norte Leste SA , the
operating unit of Brazil’s biggest fixed-line phone company,
fell for a sixth day in Sao Paulo trading after losing wireless
market share to competitors.  Telemar, which uses the Oi brand, dropped 1.1 percent to
45.65 reais, the lowest price on a closing basis since Aug. 31,
as of the 4 p.m. New York time close. Its parent,  Tele Norte
Leste Participacoes SA , fell 0.7 percent to 24.19 reais.  Oi’s mobile-phone share fell to 19.74 percent in August,
from 19.93 percent the previous month, after posting the
smallest increase in new subscribers among its closest rivals,
according to the telecommunications regulator known as Anatel.
Portugal Telecom SGPS SA agreed in July to invest as much as 8.4
billion reais ($4.9 billion) in Oi to tap into growth in
Brazil’s wireless market, after accepting an offer for its stake
in  Vivo Participacoes SA , Brazil’s biggest mobile carrier.  “Oi continues to lag,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
including  Stephen Graham  wrote in a note to clients today. “We
expect continued weakness as it reduced marketing efforts to
preserve cash.”  Vivo, which added six times as many wireless subscribers as
Oi last month, gained 2 percent to 47.10 reais. Telefonica SA
bought Portugal Telecom’s stake in Vivo for 7.5 billion euros
($9.95 billion) in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
