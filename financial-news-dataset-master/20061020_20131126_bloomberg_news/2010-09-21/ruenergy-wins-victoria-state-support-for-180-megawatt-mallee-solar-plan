             TRUenergy Holdings Pty Ltd. said it
welcomes the financial support it has won from Victoria’s state
government for the Mallee Solar Park.  
 The solar plant will be able to produce 180 megawatts of
power, enough electricity for more than 60,000 homes in the
Australian state, TRUenergy said in an e-mailed statement today.
The plant will enable the company to avoid the production of 11
million metric tons of carbon emissions over its life.  
 TRUenergy gave no financial details of the project in
today’s statement and didn’t say when the solar park would be
built.
