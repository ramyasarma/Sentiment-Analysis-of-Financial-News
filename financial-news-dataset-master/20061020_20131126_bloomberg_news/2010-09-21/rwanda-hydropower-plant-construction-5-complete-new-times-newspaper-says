Rwanda completed 5 percent of
construction of the 28 megawatt Nyaborongo hydropower plant,
which will be the East African nation’s biggest, New Times said,
citing Infrastructure Ministry Consultant Leonard Kassana.  The plant, funded through an $80 million loan from the
Indian government and $17.7 million from Rwanda, is due to be
completed in 2012, the Kigali-based newspaper reported today.
Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., India’s biggest power-equipment
market, and Angelique International Ltd. are building the plant,
which will increase electricity coverage to 16 percent by 2012
from 5 percent now, according to the New Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
