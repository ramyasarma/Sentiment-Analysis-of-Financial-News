Moody’s Investors Service lowered
the long-term ratings of 642 municipal bonds guaranteed by
banks, affecting $37 billion of debt, saying it was changing the
way it assesses securities backed by letters of credit.  The downgrades lowered 511 issues by one step, 98 by two
levels, and 33 by three notches, New York-based analysts Robert
Azrin and Naomi Richman said in a report today.  Lower ratings can raise the cost of borrowing as investors
demand higher yields in exchange for what they see as more risk.  “The updated methodology does not affect the underlying
ratings of the obligors or the rating agency’s opinion of their
credit quality,” Moody’s said Sept. 1 in announcing it would
assess issuers, their banks and “the default dependence between
the two.”  “The recent economic cycle has demonstrated the increased
interconnectedness between the banking sector and obligors in
the U.S. municipal market, particularly those obligors with
variable-rate debt,” Moody’s said today.  The ratings on 102 issues remain under review for possible
downgrade, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
