Talaat Moustafa Group Holding 
advanced to the highest level in a week after Egypt appointed a
committee to resolve a legal case relating to the property
company’s biggest land asset.  The  shares  of Egypt’s largest publicly listed real-estate
developer jumped 4 percent to 6.95 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30
p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at 14.1 billion pounds
($2.5 billion).  “The selling we saw last week was an overreaction,” said
 Hazem Choucri , foreign institutional trader at Cairo-based HC
Brokerage. “Now the government’s moves to calm investors are
helping the stock recover.”  Egypt’s government has appointed a seven-member committee
to resolve the annulled land sale without “jeopardizing the
interests of investors,” Cabinet spokesman  Magdy Rady  said
yesterday.  The stock lost 16 percent in the three days following a
decision by a Cairo court last week to uphold a ruling canceling
the sale of a 33 million-square-meter (355 million-square-foot)
plot of government land to Talaat Moustafa because it wasn’t
conducted through a public auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
