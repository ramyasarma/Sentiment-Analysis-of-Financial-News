             A tropical storm has formed over
the Pacific Ocean north of Saipan and is forecast to develop
into a typhoon in two days, the U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning
Center said.  
 Tropical Depression 13W was 450 kilometers (280 miles)
north of Saipan and 1,900 kilometers south of Tokyo at 3 a.m.
Japan time today, the center  said  on its website. The storm had
maximum sustained winds of 65 kilometers per hour and was moving
west-northwest at 11 kph.  
 The storm is forecast to become a typhoon on Sept. 23 and
may have sustained winds of 176 kph a day later. That would make
it a Category 2 storm on the five-step  Saffir-Simpson  scale,
capable of “extensive damage,” the U.S. weather service says.  
 The official forecast shows the storm tracking north over
the Japanese islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima before turning
north-northeast, remaining about 600 kilometers off the coast of
southern Japan as it heads into the northern Pacific.
