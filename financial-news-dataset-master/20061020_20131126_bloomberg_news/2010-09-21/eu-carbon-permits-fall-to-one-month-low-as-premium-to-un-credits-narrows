European Union carbon-dioxide
allowances fell to their lowest price in almost a month as
natural gas dropped. Their premium to United Nations Certified
Emission Reduction credits narrowed.  EU permits for December lost 9 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
14.93 euros ($19.60) a metric ton on London’s European Climate
Exchange, which would be their lowest close since Aug. 23.  Carbon prices have jumped 19 percent this year as utilities
bought to hedge forward power sales. The program is the world’s
biggest greenhouse-gas market.  “There were four attempts last week to move above 15.50
euros,” said  Konrad Hanschmidt , an analyst in London at
Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which provides data and research
on the carbon markets. The failure to move higher “probably
provided momentum to go below 15 euros,” Hanschmidt said today
in a phone interview.  U.K. gas for the six months through September 2011 fell 0.2
percent to 46.50 pence a therm on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange. That’s the equivalent of $7.23 per million British
thermal units. There are 100,000 Btus in a therm. Lower natural-
gas prices may prompt some power generators to switch to the
fuel, which requires about half as many carbon permits to burn
as coal.  The premium of 2010 EU allowances over UN CERs narrowed by
1.4 percent to 1.46 euros a ton, which would be its smallest
closing gap since March 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
