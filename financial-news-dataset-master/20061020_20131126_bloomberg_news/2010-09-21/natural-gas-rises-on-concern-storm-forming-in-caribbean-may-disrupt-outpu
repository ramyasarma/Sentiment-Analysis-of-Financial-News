Natural gas futures rose for the
first time in three days on concern a storm that’s developing in
the southeastern Caribbean Sea may move into gas production
regions in the Gulf of Mexico.  The weather system near the Windward Islands has a 50
percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next two
days, according to  the National Hurricane Center . The system may
become a major Category 3 storm next week and move toward the
eastern Gulf, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland.  “Obviously if there is a storm in the Gulf this late in
the season it’s going to be a game changer,” said  Peter Beutel ,
president of trading advisory company Cameron Hanover Inc. in
New Canaan, Connecticut. “It will catch a lot of traders that
are not prepared for it.”  Natural gas for October delivery gained 9.7 cents, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $3.919 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have gained 9.6
percent from a year ago.  The storm is moving westward and “environmental conditions
appear conducive for some gradual development during the next
couple of days,” according to the Hurricane Center.  The system has a 60 percent chance of developing into a
Category 3 storm on the 5-step Saffir-Simpson scale next week,
according to Commodity Weather Group.  “The model is incredibly consistent in terms of
development,” said  Matt Rogers , a forecaster with Commodity
Weather.  Gulf Impact  This hurricane season so far has had less of an impact on
Gulf gas production than had been projected by the government.
All five major Atlantic hurricanes stayed away from the main
Gulf gas production facilities.  Lisa, this year’s 12th named Atlantic storm, is about 530
miles (850 kilometers) west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands
and is on the track to drift slowly westward, according to the
hurricane center.  The Energy Department may say on Sept. 23 that U.S. gas
stockpiles increased by 83 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Sept. 17, according to the median of seven analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain is 70 billion.  U.S. gas stockpiles jumped 103 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Sept. 10 to 3.267 trillion, the Energy Department
reported last week. The storage increase was the biggest weekly
gain for this time of the year since 2006.  U.S. Stockpiles  The inventory increase exceeded the five-year average for
the first time since April. A surplus to the five-year average
rose to 6.2 percent from 5.5 percent the previous week.  Gas also rose after the Commerce Department reported that
U.S. housing starts increased 598,000 at an annual rate in
August, up 10.5 percent and the most since April. Economists
forecast August starts at a 550,000 pace.  Hotter weather may increase demand for gas from power
plants to run air conditioners. New York will have a high of 84
degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius) tomorrow, 11 degrees above
normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,
Pennsylvania.  About 23 percent of U.S. electricity is generated using
natural gas, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, declined 5.24 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $3.9529 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
268,244 as of 2:40 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
254,000. Volume was 271,936 yesterday. Open interest was 842,562
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 806,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
