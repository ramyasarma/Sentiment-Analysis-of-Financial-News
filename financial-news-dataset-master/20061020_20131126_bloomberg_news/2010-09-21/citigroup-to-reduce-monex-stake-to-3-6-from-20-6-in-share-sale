Citigroup Inc.  will sell most of
its shares in  Monex Group Inc. , a Japanese brokerage, the latest
move by the U.S. bank to reduce its holdings of Japanese assets.  Citigroup will sell 503,250 shares in  Monex  to the public
in Japan, Asia and European markets, reducing its stake to 3.6
percent from 20.6 percent, Monex said in a statement to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange today.  The transaction is the latest by Citigroup in Japan after
it sold brokerage Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. and a part of
its investment banking business to  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc.  for 545 billion yen ($6.4 billion) last year. Chief
Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  last year outlined its strategy
to focus on banking after more than $100 billion of credit
losses and writedowns.  The shares Citigroup plans to sell are worth 15.4 billion
yen based on Monex’s closing price today of 30,650 yen. Monex
hired Citigroup, Sumitomo Mitsui’s Nikko Cordial and Nomura
Holdings Inc. to lead the share sale, the company said in a
statement filed to the Ministry of Finance.  Monex will decide the price from Oct. 4 to Oct. 7, the
brokerage said. Citigroup will seek “new opportunities to
collaborate in the retail financial services” with Monex, said
 Atsuko Yoshitsugu , a Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Citigroup.  The New York-based bank last year sold its trust banking
and asset management units in Japan to Nomura and Sumitomo Trust
& Banking Co., respectively. In Japan, Citigroup is shifting its
resources to retail banking from the brokerage business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
