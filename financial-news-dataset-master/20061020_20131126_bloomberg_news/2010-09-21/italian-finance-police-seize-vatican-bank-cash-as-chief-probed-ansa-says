Italian police seized 23 million
euros ($30 million) from an account registered to the Vatican
Bank, whose chairman is under investigation for alleged money-
laundering, Ansa news agency reported, without citing anyone.  Italy’s Finance Police confiscated the funds from an
account at Credito Artigiano SpA belonging to the Institute for
Works of Religion, as the Vatican Bank is called, Ansa said
today. Vatican Bank Chairman  Ettore Gotti Tedeschi  is being
probed by Rome prosecutors for alleged money-laundering, the
news agency said.  A spokeswoman for the Vatican and a spokesman for  Credito
Artigiano  in Milan declined to comment when contacted by
telephone by Bloomberg News.  Today’s seizure came after the Bank of Italy’s  financial
intelligence unit  on Sept. 15 suspended two wire transfers from
the Vatican Bank’s account at Credito Artigiano on suspicion
that they violated anti-money laundering laws, financial daily
Il Sole 24 Ore reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
