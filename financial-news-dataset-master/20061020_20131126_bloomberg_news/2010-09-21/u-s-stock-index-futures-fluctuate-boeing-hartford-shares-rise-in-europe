U.S. stocks fell, a day after the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  reached a four-month high, as
commodity producers slid on lower metal and oil prices and
investors awaited more clues from the Federal Reserve about the
outlook for the economy.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Chevron Corp. paced
declines in producers of raw materials and energy. Monsanto Co.
slumped 2.5 percent after the world’s biggest seed company was
cut to “hold” at Morgan Joseph & Co.  ConAgra Foods Inc. , the
maker of Healthy Choice dinners, dropped 4.7 percent after
reporting profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to 1,139.67 at 12:58 p.m.
in New York after gaining the previous two sessions. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  declined 7.46 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 10,746.01.  “We’re going to be in this slow-growth environment,” said
 Jason Pride , director of investment strategy at Glenmede in
Philadelphia, which manages $18 billion. “Markets, countries’
economies are being repaired. Today is more of a wait-and-see
attitude ahead of the Fed announcement. They’ll probably signal
that we should have more downside for the economy in order to
have further quantitative easing,” he said, referring to the
central bank’s program to purchase debt to bolster the economy.  The  S&P 500  advanced 1.5 percent to 1,142.71 yesterday, the
benchmark measure’s highest level since May 13, as Lennar Corp.
beat analysts’ earnings estimates and International Business
Machines Corp. announced a $1.7 billion takeover. The gauge has
gained 2.1 percent so far this year, leaving it 6.4 percent
below its peak for 2010 on April 23.  Quantitative Easing  The Fed is likely to affirm its pledge to keep interest
rates low for an “extended period,” according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Many investors will be looking for
signs the central bank is planning to undertake another round of
asset purchases to safeguard the economic recovery, a process
known as quantitative easing. The announcement is scheduled for
2:15 p.m. in Washington.  “The chances of anything on quantitative easing in the
FOMC statement look extremely remote,”  Robert Carnell , chief
international economist at ING Financial Markets, said in a
note. “There has also been some talk of a hint at revisions to
the Fed’s internal forecasts, though these are due for release
in the minutes following the November FOMC meeting.”  Recover From Recession  The meeting takes place a day after the National
Bureau of Economic Research announced that the longest and
deepest U.S. recession since the Great Depression ended in June
2009, lasting 18 months. U.S. growth slowed to a 1.6 percent
pace in the second quarter from 3.7 percent in the first
quarter, according to revised data released Aug. 27.  The S&P 500 has risen on 75 percent of the days since March
2009 when the Fed announced its interest-rate decisions,
according to  Rob Leiphart  of Birinyi Associates Inc.  The benchmark index of U.S. stocks climbed on 9 of the 12
days since March 18, 2009, that the Fed reported its decision,
rising an average of 0.5 percent, according to a report dated
yesterday by Westport, Connecticut-based Birinyi. The Fed kept
its rate unchanged each time.  Raw-materials companies in the S&P 500 fell 1.2 percent
collectively for the biggest drop among 10 groups. Monsanto
slumped 2.7 percent to $54.02. The world’s biggest seed company
was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at Morgan Joseph because
of disappointing corn-seed results.  ConAgra  dropped 5.5 percent to $21.15. The maker of Banquet
and Healthy Choice dinners posted a 12 percent decline in first-
quarter earnings, hurt by slowing sales in its consumer-foods
business. The company also lowered its annual earnings forecast.  Oil Slides  Oil fell for the fifth time in six days before a government
report that may show U.S. refineries operated at their lowest
rate in five months, signaling less demand for crude to process
into fuels. Oil for October delivery dropped 2.3 percent, to
$73.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  SanDisk Corp . fell 6.5 percent to $35.30. The world’s
biggest maker of flash-memory cards was downgraded to
“neutral” from “buy” by  Vijay Rakesh , an analyst at Sterne,
Agee & Leach Inc., who cited weak pricing for NAND memory and
competition from  Samsung Electronics  Co.  Equity Residential  led a gauge of real-estate companies
down 1.1 percent, the second-biggest decline among 24 groups in
the S&P 500. The largest publicly traded U.S. apartment landlord
was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
Equity Residential dropped 2.2 percent to $49.38.  Home Starts  Homebuilders rallied after a Commerce Department report
showed that builders broke ground on 598,000 homes at an annual
rate, up 10.5 percent and the most since April, following a
541,000 pace in July. Economists forecast August starts at a
550,000 pace, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. Building permits, a proxy of future activity, rose
from a record low.  KB Home  rose 1 percent to $12.08, while  Toll Brothers Inc .
gained 1.1 percent to $18.83.  “It’s encouraging to see housing data stabilize amid a
significant inventory overhang,” said  Michael Mullaney , who
helps manage $9 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co. in Boston.  A measure of airline stocks rallied as much as 2.1 percent
after a trade group said carriers may post an $8.9 billion
global profit in 2010, more than triple an earlier forecast.
Earnings at airlines will probably fall to $5.3 billion next
year because of concerns about the sustainability of growth and
“razor thin” profit margins,  International Air Transport
Association  said in a statement today.  Continental Airlines Inc. gained 3.9 percent to $24.42.  UAL
Corp . rose 3.7 percent to $23.25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
