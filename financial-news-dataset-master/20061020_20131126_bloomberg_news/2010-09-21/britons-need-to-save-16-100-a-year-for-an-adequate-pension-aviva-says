Britons need to save almost one-
third of their average household income to ensure they receive
an adequate pension, according to a study by  Aviva Plc , the
U.K.’s second-biggest insurer.  British nationals retiring between 2011 and 2051 will have
to save on average 12,300 euros ($16,100) a year, more than
people in any other European country, to receive 70 percent of
their working income in retirement, the study showed. Germans
need to save 11,600 euros a year to reach that level and the
Irish should save 9,100 euros, according to the research.  Britons are facing the steepest challenge in Europe to save
for retirement after the financial crisis eroded the value of
funds, many companies stopped offering final salary pensions and
an aging population began weighing on the state coffers. The
average pretax household income was 35,100 pounds ($54,600) in
2008, the most recent government figure available, and U.K.
consumers remain the most heavily indebted in Europe, making it
even harder for people to save, according to  Datamonitor Group .  “Individuals and governments face a pensions gap
challenge, but saving more and saving earlier will significantly
help increase retirement income,” said  Andrea Moneta , chief
executive officer of Aviva’s European division.  Individual measures such as raising investment returns to
8 percent from 5 percent, boosting the state pension by 10
percent, lifting the retirement age by 10 years or having
pensioners live on 50 percent of their pre-retirement incomes
wouldn’t be sufficient to close the U.K.’s pension gap, Aviva
said. Only a combination of those measures or the increase in
savings would plug the shortfall, according to the insurer.  European Pension Gap  Europeans need to save 1.9 trillion euros extra a year to
retire on 70 percent of their salaries, according to the survey,
which was compiled with  Deloitte LLP . That level is defined as
“adequate” by the  Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development .  Aviva, which sells life and general insurance in
12 European countries, expects people to save more with private
pension providers as governments struggle to make payouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
