U.S. stock-index futures advanced
after government data showed housing starts and building permits
topped forecasts last month, bolstering optimism in the economic
recovery.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 0.2 percent to 1,138.7 at 8:31 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 21 points,
or 0.2 percent, to 10,692.  Builders broke ground on 598,000 homes at an annual rate,
up 10.5 percent and the most since April, following a 541,000
pace in July, the Commerce Department said today in Washington.
Economists forecast August starts at a 550,000 pace, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Building
permits, a proxy of future activity, rose from a record low.  The S&P 500 advanced 1.5 percent to 1,142.71 yesterday, the
benchmark measure’s highest level since May 13, as homebuilder
Lennar Corp. beat analysts’ earnings estimates and International
Business Machines Corp. announced a $1.7 billion takeover. The
gauge has gained 2.5 percent so far this year, leaving it 6.1
percent below its peak for 2010 on April 23.  The Federal Reserve’s policy committee is likely to affirm
its pledge to keep interest rates low for an “extended
period,” according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
All economists expect the rate to remain unchanged today. The
announcement is expected at about 2:15 p.m. in Washington.   The S&P 500 has risen on 75 percent of the days since March
2009 when the Fed announced its interest-rate decisions,
according to Rob Leiphart of Birinyi Associates Inc.  The benchmark index of U.S. stocks climbed on 9 of the 12
days since March 18, 2009, that the Fed reported its decision,
rising an average of 0.5 percent, according to a report dated
yesterday by Westport, Connecticut-based Birinyi. The Fed kept
its rate unchanged each time.  In Europe, most stocks advanced today after Ireland sold
1.5 billion euros ($1.97 billion) of government bonds, easing
concern that governments will struggle to repay their debt.
