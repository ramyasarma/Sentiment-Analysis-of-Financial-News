Acom Co.  and Promise Co. led shares
of Japanese consumer lenders higher in Tokyo on speculation they
will benefit from a decline in customer refund claims of
overcharged interest.  Acom, the country’s biggest consumer lender, surged 17
percent to close at 1,548 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, its
biggest gain since July 5. Promise climbed 8.6 percent to 718
yen and  Takefuji Corp.  gained 8.1 percent to 187 yen.  Consumer lenders are receiving fewer claims, leading to a
buying spree for their stock, said  Natsumu Tsujino , an analyst
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The industry has paid billions of
dollars worth of interest-refund claims since the Supreme Court
ruled that lenders had charged excessive interest rates and the
parliament passed a law restricting credit costs in 2006.  Fewer claims “brought about speculation that consumer
lenders’ business environment will turn positive,” Tokyo-based
Tsujino said by telephone. “But you can’t be too optimistic
before you see the figures for September and October.”  Takefuji received 7,635 interest-refund claims in August, a
35 percent drop from 11,756 in the same month last year and a 16
percent decline from 9,143 in July, spokeswoman Sachiko
Yamaguchi said by telephone. Claims in August totaled 8.2
billion yen, compared with 8.8 billion yen for August 2009 and
12.8 billion yen for July this year, Yamaguchi said.  Takehiro Tsuda , a Tokyo-based analyst at Citigroup Inc.,
said in a Sept. 16 note that the repayment claims Acom received
in August dropped 20 percent to 8,500 from a year earlier, and
Promise’s fell by the same margin to 8,100.  Acom and its rivals are slashing jobs and closing branches
to cope with new rules, which took effect on June 18, that cap
interest rates at 20 percent and prohibit lending to over-
leveraged borrowers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
