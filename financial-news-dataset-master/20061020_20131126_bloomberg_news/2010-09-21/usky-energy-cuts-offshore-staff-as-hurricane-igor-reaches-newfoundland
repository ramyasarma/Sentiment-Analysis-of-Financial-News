Husky Energy Inc.  cut back the
number of staff on its offshore platforms off the east coast of
Newfoundland as former Hurricane Igor spread heavy rain and high
winds in the region.  Workers based on Husky’s SeaRose floating storage and
producing platform that serves the company’s White Rose field
and others on drilling rigs were lifted off by helicopter,
 Graham White , a company spokesman, said today.  “We down-manned our SeaRose platform to a select crew,”
he said. “We continue to monitor the situation and if any
further down-manning decisions have to be made, we’ll make
them.”  The 60,000-barrel-a-day SeaRose platform “is still
producing,” White said.  “We will conduct operations in the safest possible manner
and if we have to lower the production rate because of the
weather conditions then that’s what we will do,” he said.  “We reduce personnel levels as a precautionary measure so
there is a complement of crew on the SeaRose and the drilling
rigs,” White said.  Husky’s offshore drilling platforms, GSF Grandbanks and
Henry Goodrich, in the North Amethyst field “are in a safe
location in preparation for the storm,” White said.  Igor, no longer a hurricane, still has winds of 80 miles
per hour, according to the U.S.  National Hurricane Center’s  last
advisory on the storm, issued about 4:30 p.m. East Coast time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
