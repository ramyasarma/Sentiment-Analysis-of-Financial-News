Sanofi-Aventis SA may unveil “at
least another couple critical partnerships” in diabetes in the
months to come, Riccardo Perfetti, senior medical director for
the drugmaker’s diabetes unit, said in an interview.  Sanofi has been signing partnerships to fill its diabetes
pipeline as part of a strategy to take on Danish rival Novo
Nordisk A/S, the world’s largest insulin maker. In April the
Paris-based company licensed an experimental drug from CureDM
Group Holdings LLC that seeks to restore the body’s ability to
produce insulin. Two months later it agreed to buy rights from
Metabolex Inc. for a treatment for Type 2 diabetes designed to
boost production of both insulin and a hormone called GLP-1.  “We’re very much engaged in working not only on our own
ideas and our own internal pipeline but also with external
potential partners,” said Perfetti. He said he will meet some
of them during the European Association for the Study of
Diabetes conference this week in Stockholm.  The French drugmaker is looking to expand areas such as the
medicines that promote insulin secretion and increase
sensitivity to the hormone, Perfetti said. It also may consider
candidates for a successor to its best-selling product, the
long-acting insulin Lantus, and for a new, fast-acting insulin,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
