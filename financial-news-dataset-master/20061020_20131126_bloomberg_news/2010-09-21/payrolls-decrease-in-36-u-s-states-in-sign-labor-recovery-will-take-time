Payrolls dropped in 36 U.S. states
in August, led by Michigan, indicating the labor market will
take time to rebound from the worst recession since the 1930s.  Employers in Michigan cut 50,300 jobs last month, the
biggest drop since January 2009, figures from the Labor
Department showed today in Washington. Texas and California
rounded out the three states with the biggest job losses.
Joblessness climbed in 27 states, with Nevada reaching a record
14.4 percent rate, the highest in the nation.  Companies added 67,000 jobs in August, less than in the
prior month, Labor Department figures showed on Sept. 3. The
 unemployment  rate, which climbed to 9.6 percent last month, is
forecast to average more than 9 percent through next year, one
reason Federal Reserve policy makers may consider new measures
to stimulate the economy during today’s meeting.  “We’re still in a very weak employment environment because
demand remains weak,” said Russell Price, a senior economist at
Ameriprise Financial Inc. in Detroit. “The unemployment rate is
going to languish in the 9.5 percent to 10 percent range for
some time, until the economy is able to gain better traction.”  Another report today showed  housing starts  increased more
than forecast in August, outstripping a gain in building permits
that signals residential construction will hold close to record
lows. Builders began work on 598,000 homes at an annual rate, up
10.5 percent and the most since April, the Commerce Department
said.  Permits , an indicator of future activity, were issued at a
569,000 rate.  Texas, California  Texas lost 34,200 jobs, and California eliminated 33,600,
the Labor Department said. The number of states where payrolls
dropped was the highest this year.  The 14 states showing an increase in employment were paced
by an 18,600 gain in North Carolina and a 3,600 advance in
Missouri, today’s report said.  Six of eight categories showed declines in payrolls, led by
government agencies and trade and transportation. Government
agencies cut a combined 158,000 workers from payrolls, in part
reflecting a drop in temporary census workers.  Nevada’s jobless rate climbed from 14.3 percent in July.
Unemployment in Florida and Maryland showed the biggest
statistically significant increase, the report said.  Less Unemployment  Thirteen states showed a decrease in the jobless rate, led
by a 0.8 percentage-point drop in Mississippi and a 0.5 point
decrease in Alabama.  California’s unemployment rate rose to a three-month high
of 12.4 percent last month from 12.3 percent in July, the state
announced on Sept. 17.  New York City’s unemployment rate held at 9.4 percent in
August after seven consecutive monthly decreases, the state
Labor Department said Sept. 16. The state’s jobless rate rose
0.1 percentage point to 8.3 percent.  New Jersey’s  jobless  rate fell 0.1 percentage point to 9.6
percent, state figures showed last week.  At the national level, the 13 months of unemployment at 9.5
percent or higher matches the period from mid 1982 to mid 1983
as the longest span of elevated joblessness since monthly
records began in 1948.  State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to
the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Mounting budget deficits will continue to prompt staff
reductions at state and local government agencies.  Budget Cuts  Washington Governor  Christine Gregoire  ordered a 6.3
percent cut in state spending to cope with a projected $520
million deficit through June. The move may eliminate as many as
9,000 slots at community and technical colleges, close a prison
and trim funding for 3-of-4 school districts that get extra
state money, Gregoire, a Democrat, said last week in a
statement. The step takes effect Oct. 1.  Companies cutting jobs include  FedEx Corp. , the second-
largest U.S. package-shipping company. Memphis, Tennessee-based
FedEx on Sept. 16 said it will eliminate 1,700 jobs, less than 1
percent of its global workforce, and forecast earnings for the
current quarter that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  “We expect a phase of somewhat slower economic growth
going forward,” Chief Executive Officer  Fred Smith  said on a
conference call with analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
