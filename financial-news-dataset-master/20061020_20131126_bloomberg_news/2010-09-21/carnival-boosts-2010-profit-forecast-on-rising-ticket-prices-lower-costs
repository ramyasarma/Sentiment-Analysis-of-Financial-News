Carnival Corp. , the world’s biggest
cruise-line operator, raised its fiscal 2010 forecast, citing
lower fuel costs to operate cruises and strengthening ticket
prices.  Full-year  earnings  will be $2.48 to $2.52 a share, up from
a previously expected range of $2.25 to $2.35, Miami-based
Carnival said today in a statement. Analysts predicted $2.36,
the average of 27 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, which operates cruise lines including
Seabourn, Princess and Cunard, has reduced costs and boosted
North American cruise prices, after discounts last year helped
boost demand and fill ships.  “Despite ongoing economic concerns, cruise ticket prices
remained strong close to sailing rewarding consumers that booked
early,” Chief Executive Officer  Micky Arison  said in the
statement. “We enjoyed robust demand across all products during
our seasonally strong summer period.”  Carnival rose 3.1 percent to $38.20 at 9:38 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, after reaching $38.92,
the highest intraday price since May 13.  The company reported 2009 earnings of $2.24 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
