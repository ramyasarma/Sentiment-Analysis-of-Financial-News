The Democratic Republic of Congo is
unhappy with the World Bank’s conduct with regard to a yearlong
dispute over  First Quantum Minerals Ltd.’s  $750 million Kolwezi
project, Mines Minister  Martin Kabwelulu  said.  Officials of the World Bank will not be allowed into some
mines-related meetings, Kabwelulu told reporters in Kinshasa
today. He “fell out” with unidentified officials of the World
Bank after they complained about the cancellation of First
Quantum’s license, he said.  Peter Stephens , director of external affairs for the World
Bank’s Africa Region, wasn’t available when Bloomberg News
called his office in Washington seeking comment, and he didn’t
immediately respond to e-mailed queries.  The Kolwezi project, which is part-owned by the World
Bank’s International Finance Corp. and the Industrial
Development Corp. of South Africa, was closed in September 2009
by the Congolese government after the joint venture allegedly
failed to fulfill its contractual requirements.  The dispute is the subject of arbitration before the
International Chamber of Commerce in Paris and First Quantum
last week began legal actions against  Eurasian Natural Resources
Corp. , which acquired the license to the project last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
