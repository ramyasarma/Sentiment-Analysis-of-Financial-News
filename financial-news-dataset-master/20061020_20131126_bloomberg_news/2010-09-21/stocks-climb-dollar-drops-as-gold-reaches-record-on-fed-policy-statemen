Most U.S. stocks fell, pulling the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  down from a four-month high, as
investors bought Treasuries amid speculation the Federal Reserve
will purchase more government debt to buoy the economy.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Morgan Stanley  fell at least 1.5
percent, pacing a decline of financial companies.  Equity
Residential  slumped 2.6 percent after the largest publicly
traded U.S. apartment landlord had its stock rating cut by
Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  ConAgra Foods Inc. , the maker of Banquet
and Healthy Choice dinners, lost 3.6 percent after reporting
profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to 1,139.78 at 4 p.m. in
New York, wiping out earlier gains triggered by a higher-than-
forecast increase in housing starts. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rose 7.41 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,761.03 as gains
in Caterpillar Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. led the measure to
its highest level since May 13. About two stocks fell for each
that rose on U.S. exchanges.  “We’re splitting hairs,” said  Mark Bronzo , an Irvington,
New York-based fund manager at Security Global Investors, which
oversees $21 billion. The Fed’s willingness to ease monetary
policy could be taken “as a sign that they are nervous about
economic growth. People are also realizing there’s not a lot
more the Fed can do. And the Fed said there’s no reason to do so
right now, indicating that growth is OK.”  April High  The  S&P 500  has fallen as much as 16 percent from its April
23 high amid concern American unemployment near the highest
since the 1980s and less spending from indebted European nations
would stall the global economic recovery. The gauge has gained
2.2 percent so far this year, leaving it 6.4 percent below its
peak for 2010.  The Fed’s meeting took place a day after the National
Bureau of Economic Research announced that the longest and
deepest U.S. recession since the Great Depression ended in June
2009, lasting 18 months. U.S. growth slowed to a 1.6 percent
pace in the second quarter from 3.7 percent in the first
quarter, according to revised data released Aug. 27.  “The committee will continue to monitor the economic
outlook and financial developments and is prepared to provide
additional accommodation if needed to support the economic
recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels
consistent with its mandate,” the Federal Open Market Committee
said today in a statement in Washington. The Fed reiterated that
it would keep the benchmark lending rate in a range of zero to
0.25 percent “for an extended period.”  Banks Decline  A measure of  financial companies  lost 1 percent, the
biggest decline in the S&P 500 among 10 industries. JPMorgan
fell 1.5 percent to $40.59, while Morgan Stanley declined 2.9
percent to $26.06.  Equity Residential  led a gauge of real-estate companies
down 1.8 percent, the biggest decline among 24 groups in the S&P
500. The largest publicly traded U.S. apartment landlord was
downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at Stifel Nicolaus. Equity
Residential dropped 2.6 percent to $49.15.  ConAgra  dropped 3.6 percent to $21.57. The maker of Banquet
and Healthy Choice dinners reported profit excluding some items
of 34 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 39 cents. The company also lowered its
annual earnings forecast.  Housing Starts  U.S. stocks rose earlier today after a Commerce Department
report showed that builders broke ground on 598,000 homes at an
annual rate, up 10.5 percent and the most since April, following
a 541,000 pace in July. Economists forecast August starts at a
550,000 pace, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. Building permits, a proxy of future activity, rose
from a record low.  “It’s encouraging to see housing data stabilize amid a
significant inventory overhang,” said  Michael Mullaney , who
helps manage $9 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co. in Boston.  A measure of airline stocks rallied 1.9 percent after a
trade group said carriers may post an $8.9 billion global profit
in 2010, more than triple an earlier forecast. Earnings at
airlines will probably fall to $5.3 billion next year because of
concerns about the sustainability of growth and “razor thin”
profit margins,  International Air Transport Association  said in
a statement today.  Continental Airlines Inc. gained 4.9 percent to $24.66.  UAL
Corp . rose 4.8 percent to $23.50.  Telephone companies, including  Verizon Communications Inc .,
rose 0.3 percent collectively. Some investors took advantage of
the group’s 5.4 percent dividend yields, the highest within 10
S&P 500 groups, compared with Treasuries. Two-year note yields
fell to a record low today on speculation the Fed would ease
monetary policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
