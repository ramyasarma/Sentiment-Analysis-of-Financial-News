Three U.K. athletes who were
expected to challenge for gold medals at the Commonwealth Games
in India said they would not be going to New Delhi, the London-
based Times reported.  Phillips Idowu, the triple-jump world champion last year,
cited on Twitter his concern about the organization of the
Games, noting that his “safety is more important” to his
children “than a medal.” The other two athletes, Christine
Ohuruogu and Lisa Dobriskey, said they were pulling out because
of injury concerns, the newspaper said.  Their withdrawals followed the collapse of a footbridge at
the Nehru stadium today in which at least 27 people were
injured, the Times said. Mike Fennell, the president of the
Commonwealth Games Federation, said today he had asked for the
urgent intervention of the Indian government after severe delays
to the completion of the athletes’ village, the newspaper said,
adding that statements from the English and Scottish teams
expressed concerns about conditions and safety.      Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
