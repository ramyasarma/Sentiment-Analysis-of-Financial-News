             Rubber advanced to the highest
level in almost five months amid expectation that the global
market is set for the worst shortage in four years next year as
weather constrains supply and demand keeps expanding.  
 Futures in Tokyo climbed as much as 3.2 percent to the
highest level since April 30. The price increased for a second
day and has gained 10 percent this year.  
 Natural rubber consumption will outpace supply by 127,000
metric tons next year, the most since 2007, according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Stockpiles of the raw material used in tires,
gloves and condoms will drop 12 percent to 67 days of demand in
2011, the lowest level in at least 11 years, the bank estimates.
Drought earlier this year and heavy rainfall later on hampered
tree-tapping across plantations in Asia, according to Pongsak
Kerdvongbundit, managing director of Phuket, Thailand-based Von
Bundit Co., the largest producer.  
 “The bullish outlook from the bank helped boost the
futures,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at Tokyo-based broker
Fujitomi Co., said today by phone. “Market fundamentals look
tight in the medium term.”  
 February-delivery rubber rose as much as 9.4 yen to 305.9
yen per kilogram ($3,574 a metric ton) before trading at 304 yen
on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 11:18 a.m.  
 October-delivery rubber surged by as much as 10 yen per
kilogram, triggering a circuit breaker by the bourse and leading
to suspension in futures trading for five minutes.  
 Global consumption will advance 9.4 percent this year to
10.31 million tons, the fastest increase since 2004, according
to the Singapore-based International Rubber  Study  Group, which
says it has 16 countries and the European Union as contributing
members. Demand will exceed output by 60,000 tons, from a
surplus of 237,000 tons last year.  
 Floods  
 Sales of rubber are increasing the most in six years,
helped by what the International Monetary Fund says will be the
fastest global economic growth since 2007. Rain and flooding in
Thailand and Indonesia, the top producers, drenched farms and
curbed harvesting.  
 “La Nina will decrease” rubber production, Jakarta-based
PT Mandiri Sekuritas said in today’s report. “Rubber production
will decrease because the tapping process cannot be done in
heavy rain.”  
 Futures may climb as much as 14 percent to $4 a kilogram by
March on the Singapore Commodity Exchange, according to the
median estimate of nine brokers and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The price in Tokyo is expected to return to this
year’s peak of 338.5 yen reached on April 16, the highest level
in 21 months, Kazunori Kokubo at Tokyo-based broker  Yutaka Shoji 
said today by phone.  
 March-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost
0.4 percent to 26,415 yuan ($3,938) a ton at 10:34 a.m. local
time.  Natural-rubber  inventories climbed 2,195 tons to 27,415
tons, the exchange said on Sept. 17, based on a survey of 10
warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.
