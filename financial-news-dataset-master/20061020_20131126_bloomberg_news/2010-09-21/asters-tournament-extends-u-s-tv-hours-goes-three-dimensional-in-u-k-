The  Masters Tournament  will add an
extra hour of U.S. television coverage during the first two days
of play and 3-D coverage in the U.K. for the golf season’s first
major championship.  The 2011 Masters, held at Augusta National Golf Club in
Augusta, Georgia, will air on  Walt Disney Co .’s ESPN from 3 p.m.
to 7:30 p.m. New York time on April 7 and 8, Masters Chairman
 Billy Payne  said today. Last year, the broadcasts on the first
two days of the tournament ran 4-7:30 p.m.  “Since our first telecast of the Masters in 1956, we have
carefully maintained a tradition of high-quality programming
within an appropriate broadcast window,” Payne said in a
statement. “Now, with the proper infrastructure and resources
in place, we are confident the additional coverage will meet the
high standards of the millions of golf fans who enjoy viewing
the Masters each April.”  Sky Sports will join the BBC as a live broadcaster of the
2011 Masters, Payne also announced.  British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc ’s Sky Sports will televise the Wednesday Par 3 Contest
and all four rounds of the tournament, making 3D coverage
available to viewers with three-dimensional-capable televisions.
The BBC, a Masters partner since 1986, also will air live
weekend coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
