Twitter Inc.’s website was impaired
by a security flaw that caused people to unwillingly resend
messages posted by other users and directed them to third-party
sites, including ones that feature pornography.  Twitter subscribers described the flaw in posts on the
site, and it affected the account of White House press secretary
 Robert Gibbs . San Francisco-based Twitter said in  postings  that
it identified an attack and “fully patched” it.  The flaw affected subscribers when they moved their mouse
over infected short messages, or tweets, causing an embedded
code to execute and creating messages that directed people to
third-party sites, said  Graham Cluley , a consultant at  Sophos
Plc , an Abingdon, England-based computer-security firm. It
stemmed from a vulnerability that lets people post scripts -- a
type of software code -- into tweets, he said.  “From time to time, I have no doubt that there will be
those that want to gum up the system and things like that,”
Gibbs said at his regular White House briefing today. “I don’t
hesitate to continue to use it.”  Cluley said the vulnerability spread widely among Twitter
users. “It’s a problem and it’s widespread. It’s like someone
has just thrown gas over a fire,” he said. He estimated that
100,000 people or more were affected.  People who use third-party client software to access
Twitter, such as TweetDeck and Seesmic, were unaffected, he
said. Origins of the attack aren’t yet known, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
