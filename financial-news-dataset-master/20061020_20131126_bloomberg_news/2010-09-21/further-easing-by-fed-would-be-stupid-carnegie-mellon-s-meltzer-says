The Federal Reserve is too focused
on short-term results and may be considering the pursuit of
flawed policies, said  Allan Meltzer , a historian of the U.S.
central bank.  “We don’t have a monetary problem, we have 1 trillion or
more in excess reserves so it’s literally stupid to say we’re
going to add another trillion to that,” Meltzer, a professor at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness With  Margaret Brennan .”  “One of the major mistakes that the Fed makes all the time
is too much concentration on the short-term,” said Meltzer,
author of a history of the Fed. “Aiming at that is just a
fool’s game.”  The FOMC started its one-day meeting around 8 a.m. today in
Washington and is scheduled to release a policy statement at
about 2:15 p.m. The meeting takes place a day after the National
Bureau of Economic Research announced that the longest and
deepest U.S. recession since the Great Depression ended in June
2009, lasting 18 months.  The Fed is considering further expanding its balance sheet
from its current level of $2.3 trillion to invigorate a slowing
recovery. The expanding balance sheet has left banks with over
$1 trillion in excess reserves.  “You don’t have to be very smart or study economics to
know you don’t need more excess reserves,” said Meltzer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
