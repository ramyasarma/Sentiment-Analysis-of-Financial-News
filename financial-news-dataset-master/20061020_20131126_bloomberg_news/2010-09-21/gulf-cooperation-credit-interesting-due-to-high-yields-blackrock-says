Gulf Cooperation Council countries’
debt is “interesting” for investors because of high yields,
according to  BlackRock Inc.,  the world’s biggest money manager.  “There is a global search for yield and the GCC is an
interesting place to look,” Nick Anderson, managing director for
Middle East and Africa at BlackRock, told a conference in Dubai
today. “You are seeing people increasingly focused on the region
because there are some high yields.”  The average yield on bonds sold by GCC issuers, including
Qatar and Saudi Arabia, fell 91 basis points, to 4.79 percent so
far this quarter, according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai GCC
Conventional US Bond Index. Bond markets are starting to pick up
in the GCC after new issuances were halted during the financial
crisis as the cost of borrowing soared.  Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s largest economy, and Qatar
show a “strong” macro-economic growth with budget surpluses and
infrastructure spending, Stephen Hull, director at BlackRock’s
multi-asset client solutions group, said at the event.  The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman.  The U.A.E., the second-largest Arab economy, should see an
increase in investments because of its inclusion as a secondary
emerging market in the FTSE Group’s Global Equity index, said
 Nick Nefouse , director and product strategist at the New York-
based asset management company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
