             Investors should be wary of a
“pull-back” in India’s benchmark  stock index  even as the
measure is poised to test its so-called primary resistance at
20,000, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 The 14-day  relative strength index  for the Bombay Stock
Exchange’s Sensitive Index reached 81.99 yesterday, the highest
since October 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
reading suggests that India is the only market in Asia that is
“overbought,” according to  Kenneth Chan  and  Tacky Cheng .  
 The Sensex, as the gauge is known, has climbed 14 percent
this year, making India the best performer among the world’s 10
largest stock markets by value. The index yesterday closed at
19,906.10, the highest since January 2008, the month it reached
its all-time intraday high of 21,206.77.  
 Investors should be “cautious for a pull-back,” the Hong
Kong-based analysts at Nomura wrote in a report yesterday,
citing “profit-taking concerns on overbought and falling volume
momentum breadth.”  
 Any declines may take the  Sensex  to 19,513, a previous
resistance that became a support level after the gauge’s
breakout, according to the analysts. The index’s subsequent
support can be found at 18,664, they said.  
 The relative strength index, or RSI, measures how rapidly
prices have advanced or declined during the specified time-
period. Some analysts see a level of more than 70 as an
indication that prices are poised to decline, while a reading of
less than 30 is a signal to buy.  
 Technical analysts observe price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines. Such
analysts use trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
