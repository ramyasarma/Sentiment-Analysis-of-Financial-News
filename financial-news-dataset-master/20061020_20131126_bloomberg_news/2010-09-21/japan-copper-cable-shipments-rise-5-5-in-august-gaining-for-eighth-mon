Japan’s copper wire and cable
shipments gained 5.5 percent in August from a year earlier,
advancing for an eighth month, an industry group said.  Shipments, including exports and domestic business,
increased to 53,300 metric tons last month from 50,531 tons
a year earlier, the  Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers’
Association  said today in an e-mailed statement. Shipments
totaled 59,579 tons in July, the data showed.  Copper, used in pipes and wires, has risen 24 percent in
the past year. Japan’s economy slowed less than initially
estimated in the second quarter as companies boosted capital
spending, indicating that the nation’s recovery was intact
before a surge in the yen threatened to stunt export gains.  As a government-subsidy program -- which exempts purchases
of electric, hybrid, natural gas and some diesel vehicles from
taxes --  will end this month, the outlook for demand remains
uncertain, the group said in a statement.  The association’s shipment estimate for the year ending
March 2011 was raised to 666,000 tons from a March projection of
661,000 tons, compared with the previous year’s 662,500 tons,
the statement said. In the year ending March 2015, the shipment
forecast was boosted to 713,000 tons, it said.  Japan’s  gross domestic product  grew an annualized 1.5
percent in the second quarter, faster than the 0.4 percent pace
reported in August, the Cabinet Office said on Sept. 10. The
economy expanded 5 percent in the first quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
