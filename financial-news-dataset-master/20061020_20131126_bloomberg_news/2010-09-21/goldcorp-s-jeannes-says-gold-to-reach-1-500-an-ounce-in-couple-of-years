     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg News) -- The price of gold will reach
$1,500 an ounce in the “next couple of years,” said  Goldcorp
Inc.  Chief Executive Officer  Chuck Jeannes .  “I still feel comfortable that in the next couple of years
we’ll see $1,500,” Jeannes, who runs the second-biggest gold
producer by market value, said today in an interview at the
Denver Gold Forum. Jeannes said gold would reach $1,500 in the
“next few years” when he was named CEO of Vancouver-based
Goldcorp in December 2008.  Gold futures for December delivery surged to a record
$1,290.40 an ounce at 2:43 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  “There’s so many things going on from a macroeconomic
standpoint around the world that are causing people to invest in
gold, whether it’s as a safe haven, a hedge against future
inflation, a bet against the U.S. dollar or other currencies,”
Jeannes said today. “It’s very unlikely for things to change
significantly that those reasons for buying gold are going to go
away.”  The world’s largest gold producer is Toronto-based  Barrick
Gold Corp.   To contact the reporter on this story:
