Typhoon Fanapi has brought the
heaviest rains in a century to China’s southern province of
Guangdong, triggering landslides in some cities, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported today.  Fanapi, which landed in coastal Fujian province on Monday,
wreaked havoc in Fujian and Guangdong before it weakened into a
low pressure system at 5 a.m. today, Xinhua said.  Heavy rain triggered floods and landslides in Maoming City
in Guangdong, where more than 8,000 people were evacuated,
Xinhua said. No deaths or injuries were reported, it said.  The storm knocked out phone lines and flooded streets,
destroying a bridge in city, according to  weather.com.cn , a
website under the China Meteorological Administration.  In Fujian Province, six counties reported more than 200
millimeters (7.9 inches) of rain in 23 hours after the typhoon
made landfall Monday morning, Xinhua said. Rain continued in
Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and Longyan cities today, the report
said.  Fanapi swept across Taiwan over the weekend, downing
electric lines, forcing evacuations and closing offices,
airports and ground transport. Two people were killed and 107
were hurt, the National Fire Agency said in a statement today.  Taiwan’s agricultural losses reached NT$3.4 billion ($107
million), the Council of Agriculture said in a statement on its
website today.  To contact the news staff on this story:
