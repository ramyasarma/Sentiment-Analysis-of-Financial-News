The Moroccan  central bank  held its
benchmark interest rate at the lowest level in 18 months, citing
“moderate” inflation.  The Rabat-based central bank, which meets every three
months to review its monetary policy, left its key rate at 3.25
percent, it said in a statement on its website today.  “Inflation is at a very low level,”  Mohamed Abu Basha , an
economist at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, a Cairo-based investment
bank, said by telephone. “The non-agriculture economy is slowly
recovering but we are still at the early stages of the
recovery.”  Inflation eased to 0.6 percent in August from 1.1 percent
in the previous month, the state-run statistics agency, the Haut
Commissariat, said. The central bank said today that it expects
inflation to average about 1 percent this year.  “Inflation remained moderate due to the absence of
significant domestic demand-related pressures and low inflation
in the major trading partner countries,” the bank said in its
statement.  The central bank said in June that it expected the rebound
in non-agriculture activities to continue in 2010. Morocco
relies on agriculture, tourism and phosphate exports for
economic growth.  The central bank last changed its interest rate in March
2009, lowering it by quarter of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
