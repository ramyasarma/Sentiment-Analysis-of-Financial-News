European Commission President Jose
Barroso said Ireland is taking the “right measures” to tackle
its budget deficit.  “All the information we have is that the situation is
under control,” Barroso said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in New York yesterday. “The government of Ireland
has taken very courageous measures from the beginning.”  The EU is “following the situation closely,” he said.    “We believe they have the capacity, also with European
Union support, to face any kind of more difficult situation,”
Barroso said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
