Nigeria’s central bank unexpectedly
raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time this year
after inflation accelerated.  The monetary policy rate was increased to 6.25 percent from
6 percent,  Lamido Sanusi , governor of the  Central Bank of
Nigeria , said today at a briefing in Abuja, the capital. Only
one of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast rates
would rise, while the others predicted no change.  Inflation accelerated to 13.7 percent in August from 13
percent the month earlier, the  National Bureau of Statistics 
said on Sept. 17. Sanusi said last week that the bank is
targeting inflation of less than 10 percent and that the main
pressure on prices came from the planned elimination of fuel
subsidies, which is already pushing up transportation costs.  Nigeria’s government is aiming to remove the subsidies by
the end of 2011 and possibly this year, Finance Minister
 Olusegun Aganga  said on Sept. 3. That may increase gasoline
costs to as much as 120 naira (79 U.S. cents) a liter from 64
naira now, he said.  The economy, the second-largest in sub-Saharan Africa after
South Africa, expanded 7.7 percent in the second quarter,
compared with 7.2 percent in the preceding three months, driven
by the non-oil industries,  Labaran Maku , minister of state for
information, said on July 28.  Nigeria is the continent’s top oil producer and the fifth-
largest supplier of U.S. crude imports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
