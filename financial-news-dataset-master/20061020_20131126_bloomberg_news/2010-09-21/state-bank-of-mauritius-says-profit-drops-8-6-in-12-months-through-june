State Bank of Mauritius Ltd ., the
country’s second-biggest company by market value, reported an
8.4 percent drop in profit for the year through June as interest
income retreated.  Net income fell to 1.86 billion rupees ($59.6 million) from
2.03 billion rupees a year earlier, the Port Louis-based company
said in a statement published on its website today.  Interest income dropped to 4.87 billion rupees from 5.33
billion rupees, it said.  “Trade volume was subdued, credit demand slowed down in
line with lingering uncertainty regarding the economic outlook
as a result of the global slowdown, particularly in Europe,”
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
