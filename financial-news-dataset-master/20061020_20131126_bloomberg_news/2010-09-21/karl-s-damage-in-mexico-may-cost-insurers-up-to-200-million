Hurricane Karl’s damage in Mexico
may cost insurers as much as $200 million, according to
catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide.  The storm will probably cost at least $100 million based on
estimates of wind and flood damage, the Boston-based firm said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Karl hit Mexico for the second time Sept. 17 as a
Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. The
storm caused flooding in parts of the state of Veracruz and a
landslide in Nexticapan.  “Economic losses are likely to be significant,” and
exceed the cost to the insurance industry because many property
owners didn’t have coverage, AIR said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
