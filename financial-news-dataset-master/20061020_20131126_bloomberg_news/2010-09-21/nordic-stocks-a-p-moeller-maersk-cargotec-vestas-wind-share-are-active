in Nordic markets today. Symbols are in parentheses.  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S  (MAERSKB DC) increased 3.9 percent

container shipper was raised to “buy” from “hold” at ING
Groep NV.      Danisco A/S  (DCO DC) added 2.9 percent to 484.40 kroner, the
shares’ third increase. The world’s biggest maker of food
ingredients lifted its full-year sales forecast to “around” 15
billion kroner ($2.64 billion) from “above” 14.5 billion
kroner previously.  Nokia Oyj  (NOK1V FH) slumped 4.5 percent to 7.52 euros,
erasing yesterday’s 3.3 percent gain. The world’s largest maker
of mobile phones may push back its N8 model because of software
glitches, Electronista and Endgadget reported. Nokia denied
this, and spokesman  Doug Dawson  said the N8 will be shipped by
the end of the month, as planned.  Swedbank AB  (SWEDA SS) the biggest bank in the Baltics,
rose 1.2 percent to 93.85 kronor, extending yesterday’s 2.5
percent increase. The bank was raised to “neutral” from
“sell” at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Telenor ASA  (TEL NO), the Nordic region’s largest phone
company, jumped 1.5 percent to 94.40 kroner, the stock’s highest
price since Sept. 1. The company said it aims to lower costs and
capital expenditure to pay a “competitive” dividend.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S  (VWS DC), the world’s largest maker
of wind turbines, retreated for a fifth day, slipping 1.7
percent to 208.60 kroner. The number of wind turbine
installations in the U.S., the world’s second-largest market,
will drop because of an “unfavorable” policy environment and
“adverse” macro-economic conditions, Make Consulting said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
