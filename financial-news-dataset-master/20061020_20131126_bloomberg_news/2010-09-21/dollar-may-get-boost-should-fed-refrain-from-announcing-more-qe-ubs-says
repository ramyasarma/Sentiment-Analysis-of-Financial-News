The dollar may strengthen should
the Federal Reserve refrain from outlining new policy measures
to stimulate the economy, according to UBS AG.  “If no further quantitative easing is announced, the U.S.
dollar should be supported as it has been dampened by
expectations of further quantitative easing in recent weeks,”
 Gareth Berry , a strategist in Singapore, wrote today in a note.  The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3089 as of 7:27 a.m.
in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
