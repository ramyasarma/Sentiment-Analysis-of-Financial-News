Corn rose for the eighth time in
nine sessions as early harvest results fueled concern that
production will fall short of forecasts in the U.S., the world’s
largest grower and exporter.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its forecast on
Sept. 10 by 1.5 percent to 13.16 billion bushels after unusually
hot, dry weather in August damaged crops already stunted by too
much rain in June. An estimated 18 percent of the crop was
harvested as of Sept. 19, up from the average of 10 percent in
the previous five seasons, the USDA said yesterday.  “A lot of people are talking about lower yields and a U.S.
crop less than 13 billion bushels,” said  Jerry Gidel , a market
analyst for North American Risk Management Services Inc. in
Chicago. “There’s a lack of confidence that better yields in
Iowa and Minnesota can make up for losses in Illinois and the
eastern Midwest.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 8.5 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $5.1675 a bushel at 10:51 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Before today, the grain rose 9.9 percent since Sept.
8. Yesterday, the most-active contract touched $5.2375, the
highest price since September 2008.  Earlier, the price fell on speculation that increased
harvesting will overwhelm immediate demand for U.S. supplies.  Mostly dry weather beginning Sept. 24 will aid harvesting
the next two weeks,  T-Storm Weather LLC  said in a report today.  “Harvesting is going to come very quickly,” said  Bill Biedermann , a senior vice president for Allendale Inc. in
McHenry, Illinois. “Buyers are not going to be very aggressive
for cash supplies the next few weeks.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
