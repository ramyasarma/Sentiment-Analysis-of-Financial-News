Pioneer Foods Ltd. , the South
African maker of Sasko bread and Weet-Bix cereal, said a
financial settlement with the country’s antitrust authorities
over bread prices may surpass provisions it made for the accord.  “Indications are that the settlement amount will exceed
the provision previously made by Pioneer Foods,” the Paarl,
Western Cape-based company said today in a statement. The
Competition Tribunal on Feb. 3 imposed a fine of 195.7 million
rand ($27.6 million) on Pioneer for its role in a bread cartel.  Pioneer was the only bread maker out of four that didn’t
admit to price-fixing following a complaint from Western Cape
distributors in 2006 that bakeries had increased prices a week
before Christmas. Premier Foods Ltd., based at Isando near
Johannesburg, was exempted from prosecution after helping the
Competition Commission with its investigation. Tiger Brands
Ltd., the country’s biggest food company, was fined 99 million
rand in 2007, while Foodcorp Ltd. paid 45.4 million rand.  Pioneer’s  shares  fell for a second day, dropping 98 cents,
or 2 percent, to 48.02 rand at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg,
valuing the company at 9.7 billion rand. Pioneer made a
provision of 350 million rand in its interim results.  “The settlement may be finalized within the next few
weeks,” the company said today.  South Africa’s competition commission investigates
antitrust complaints and makes recommendations to the tribunal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
