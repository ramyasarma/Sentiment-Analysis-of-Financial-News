Croatia will sell or lease 28
million square meters (301 million square feet) of buildable
land as the government taps new sources for generating revenue,
said  Vedran Duvnjak , the head of the  Croatian Property Fund .  The land sites, worth at least hundreds of millions of
dollars at market prices, are scattered throughout Croatia,
including the Adriatic coast, an increasingly popular holiday
destination for Europeans.  The move comes as the government announced it will sell
minority stakes in state companies in order to slice the growing
budget deficit and prepare for the final round of negotiations
with the European Union. Croatia hopes to join the bloc in 2012
as the second former Yugoslav republic after Slovenia.  “We are still deciding which sites will be sold, and which
will be leased with right to build,” Duvnjak said in an
interview.  The Croatian Property Fund arranges sales of stakes or
entire companies formerly run by the state under Yugoslavia’s
communist regime to private investors.  The public offering, in which the government will announce
the minimal price, will start “sometime in the near future,”
Duvnjak said.  “Papers are ready for the first batch of 30 sites,
amounting to a total of 110,000 square meters and with the
estimated value of 42 million kuna ($7.5 million),” he said.  In order to fulfill the EU requirements, Croatia needs to
clear the backed-up judiciary system, improve competition, and
make administration rules simpler and more transparent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
