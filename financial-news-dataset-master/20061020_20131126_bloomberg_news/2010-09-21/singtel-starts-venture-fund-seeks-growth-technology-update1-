             Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. ,
Southeast Asia’s  biggest phone company , set up a S$200 million
($150 million) venture fund to invest in start-ups to get access
to new technology and boost growth.  
 The company will work with innovators, government agencies
and research organizations and equity providers to explore new
technologies, Chief Executive Officer  Chua Sock Koong  said today.
SingTel will be the sole owner of the new fund, the company said
in a statement.  
 The SingTel Innov8 venture fund is part of the company’s
plan to transform itself from a traditional telecommunications
supplier to a multimedia and information-technology services
provider, the statement said. Mobile-phone operators are
counting on the popularity of smartphones such as Apple Inc.’s
iPhone to drive up usage of wireless data and applications to
revive profit growth as markets saturate worldwide.  
 “With Innov8, the group will continue to shape the market
and deliver sustainable growth into the future,” Chua said.  
 The fund will invest and incubate innovations to eventually
bring them to the market, the statement said.  
 Singtel fell 0.3 percent to S$3.09 at 10:58 a.m in the city
state, while the benchmark Straits Times Index added 0.2 percent.  
 Last week, SingTel said it aims to boost revenue from non-
telecommunications business to 50 percent of the total for the
Singapore unit in three years from 30 percent now.  
 SingTel’s annual  sales growth  has averaged 6.1 percent in
the past five years, lagging behind the 19 percent average for
 China Mobile Ltd. , the world’s largest telecommunications
company by market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
