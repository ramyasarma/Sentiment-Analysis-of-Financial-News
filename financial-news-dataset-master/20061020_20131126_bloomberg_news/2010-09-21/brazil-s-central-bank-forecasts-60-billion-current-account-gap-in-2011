Brazil’s current account gap will
widen to a record $60 billion in 2011 from $49 billion in 2010,
the central bank forecast today, as domestic demand and the
real’s rally boost spending on imports and overseas travel.  The deficit in the  current account , the broadest measure of
trade and services, narrowed to $2.86 billion in August from a
$4.5 billion deficit a month earlier, the central bank said
today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a deficit of
$2.5 billion according to the median of 19 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  A $60 billion current account gap in 2011 is in line with
analysts’ expectations and is unlikely to lead to currency
weakness given that Brazil remains an attractive destination for
foreign investment, said  Zeina Latif , senior economist for Latin
America at RBS Securities Inc. in Sao Paulo.  “It’s a flaw, but just that. I’m not seeing pressure for
depreciation,” Latif said. “The currency’s behavior shows the
markets are not concerned.”  High commodities prices will also continue to underpin the
currency, Latif added. Commodities, according to the
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index, rose to a nine-month high yesterday
and has gained 6 percent this month.  Brazil’s current account deficit is “not explosive,”
 Altamir Lopes , head of the bank’s economic department, said at a
press conference in Brasilia.  Foreign direct investment  decreased to $2.43 billion in
August from $2.64 billion in July, the bank said.  Rising Real  The real appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.7244 per dollar at
1:08 p.m. New York time, from 1.7331 yesterday. In the overnight
interest-rate futures market, the yield on the contract due
January 2012, the most traded today on Sao Paulo’s BM&F
exchange, rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
11.540 percent.  Brazil’s government authorized its sovereign wealth fund to
begin purchasing dollars as part of efforts to stem the real’s
appreciation, the Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  Since President  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva took office in
2003, the real has more than doubled in value against the
dollar, becoming the biggest gainer among the 17 most-traded
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Brazil, along with China and India, have surpassed the U.S.
as a preferred destination for investment over the next year,
according to a September poll of 1,408 investors, analysts and
traders who are Bloomberg subscribers.  Policy, Consumer Prices  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index rose 0.31
percent in the month through mid-September, the national
statistics agency said in a report distributed in Rio de Janeiro
today. The index fell in July and August.  Policy makers on Sept. 1 kept the benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 10.75 percent, after raising the Selic a total of
two percentage points over their three previous meetings to
prevent the economy from overheating.  Analysts forecast policy makers will resume raising in
March, and will lift the Selic to 11.75 percent by June,
according to the median forecast in a Sept. 17 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published yesterday.  Analysts expect consumer prices to rise 4.95 percent in
2011, up from a week-earlier forecast of 4.90 percent, according
to the survey.  Economists also raised their 2010 inflation forecast to
5.01 percent, from 4.97 percent a week earlier. The central bank
targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage
points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
