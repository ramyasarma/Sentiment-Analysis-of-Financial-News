David Jones Ltd. ’s second-half
profit rose 7.6 percent, helped by demand for shoes and clothes,
as Australia’s second-biggest department store operator and
affirmed its earnings outlook.  Net income  rose to A$70.3 million ($67 million) in the six
months ended July 25 from A$65.4 million a year earlier. Second-
half figures were derived by subtracting first-half  earnings 
from the A$170.8 million full-year profit the Sydney-based
company reported today.  Profit increased because of reduced costs to supply stores
and demand for shoes and designer fashions, the company said in
a statement. Chief Executive Officer  Paul Zahra , in the role for
three months, said today cost reductions started under
predecessor  Mark McInnes  and new outlets will underpin annual
profit growth of as much as 10 percent this year and next.  The full-year profit compares with the A$170.3 million
average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings before interest and tax from department stores
rose 13 percent to A$79.2 million in the second half as the
company cut old inventory.  The  financial services unit , which includes a store credit
card with American Express Co., posted a 7.4 percent rise in
profit to A$23.2 million.  David Jones  shares  slipped 1.9 percent to A$5.10 at the
4:10 p.m. close of trading on the Australian Securities Exchange
and have fallen 5.6 percent this year  compared  with a 5 percent
decline by the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  The company said two stores scheduled to open in the 12
months ending 2012 have been delayed by between 18 and 24 months
after mall owners deferred development projects.  Zahra, 44, was appointed CEO on June 18, the same day
McInnes quit the company after “unbecoming” behavior toward a
female employee.  Kristy Fraser-Kirk, a David Jones publicist, is suing the
company and McInnes for as much as A$37 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
