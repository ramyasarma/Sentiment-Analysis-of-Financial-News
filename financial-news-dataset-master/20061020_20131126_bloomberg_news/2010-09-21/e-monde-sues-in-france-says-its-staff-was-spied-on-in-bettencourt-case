Le Monde, France’s newspaper of
record, filed a lawsuit in Paris over what it says was illegal
surveillance of its reporters working on investigations related
to  L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt ’s government ties.  The newspaper filed the suit yesterday “against X,” Le
Monde editor Sylvie Kauffmann said in a statement today. The
“against X” legal concept is employed in France when the
individuals responsible for an alleged violation aren’t
precisely known.  Le Monde said last week that French espionage services had
spied on its staff to determine the source for its reports on
whether Labor Minister  Eric Woerth  used his government office to
secure a job for his wife with Bettencourt’s financial adviser.  President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has been drawn into a legal probe
of potential tax and election-code violations by Bettencourt,
after a former butler of the heiress made secret tapes in which
her financial adviser allegedly refers to political gifts and
overseas accounts. Woerth is the former treasurer of Sarkozy’s
ruling Union for a Popular Movement party.  A spokeswoman for the French Interior Ministry, who
declined to be named in line with government policy, said the
ministry would not comment on the lawsuit.
