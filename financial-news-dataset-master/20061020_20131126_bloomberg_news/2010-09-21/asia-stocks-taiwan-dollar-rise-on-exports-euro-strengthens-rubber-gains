concerns fueling risk aversion, so the fact that these countries
can successfully carry out bond auctions can be nothing but a
positive sign,” said  Francisco Salvador , a strategist at
Iberian Equities in Madrid. “We still have to wait to see what
the Fed says. That will be key on sentiment.”  Ireland sold 1.5 billion euros of bonds repayable in 2014
and 2018, with investors bidding for more than five times the
amount of bonds available.  Spreads, Bond Risk  Spain sold 12-month bills at an average yield of 1.908

to 1.7 points. The spread on 10-year Portuguese bonds narrowed
by 15 basis points to 3.81 points over bunds, after central bank

sovereign debt declined, with contracts on Ireland dropping 24
basis points to 421.5, Spain falling 2 basis points to 234,

point to 193, according to data provider CMA.  Worst Over  Four months after an EU bailout, Germany’s biggest bond
