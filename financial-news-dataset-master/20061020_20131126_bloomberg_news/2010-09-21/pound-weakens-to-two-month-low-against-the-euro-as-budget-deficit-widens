The pound fell to the weakest
against the euro in two months as a report showed the U.K.’s
budget deficit widened more than forecast in August, raising the
prospect of deeper government spending cuts.  The British currency touched a six-day low versus the
dollar and U.K. government bonds rose. The U.S. Federal Reserve
may signal a move to looser monetary policy when it decides on
interest rates later today. The Bank of England will release
minutes of its last interest-rate meeting tomorrow.  “Public finances are a risk to sterling, which is
vulnerable to a further drop against the euro at these levels,”
said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG
in London. “If the Fed opens the door to further quantitative
easing then that could signal other central banks are also
willing to do something and the next would be the Bank of
England.”  The pound weakened 0.5 percent to 84.45 pence per euro as
of 4:55 p.m. in London, after earlier depreciating to 84.70
pence, the weakest since July 21. Sterling was little changed at
$1.5550 and 0.3 percent lower at 132.77 yen.  Britain posted the largest budget deficit for any August
since records began in 1993, the Office for National Statistics
said today.  Net borrowing  was 15.3 billion pounds, compared with
13.5 billion pounds a year earlier. The median of 15 forecasts
in a Bloomberg News survey was a shortfall of 12.5 billion
pounds.  Financial ‘Challenges’  The pound fell yesterday against all 16 of its peers after
reports showed  mortgage approvals  by the nation’s six-largest
banks dropped to the lowest level since April 2009, and U.K.
home sellers lowered  asking prices  for a third month in
September, wiping out half of the gains made since the start of
2010. The pound stayed lower even as Moody’s Investors Service
said the U.K. can meet its financial “challenges” and maintain
its Aaa credit rating.  U.K. government bonds advanced, with the yield on the 10-
year gilt 3 basis points lower at 3.12 percent. Two-year yields
fell 2 basis points to 0.70 percent.  The U.K. will sell 550 million pounds of 2027 index-linked
bonds on Sept. 23, the Debt Management Office said today.  Gilts have returned 4.4 percent this quarter, compared with
3.3 percent for German bunds and 2.7 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
