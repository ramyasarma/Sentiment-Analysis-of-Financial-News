The euro may surge to a seven-month
high against the dollar after breaching its 200-day moving
average, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The 16-nation currency traded above its 200-day moving
average of $1.3220 today, breaking the trend line for the first
time since May 2009. The euro could rally to $1.40 by late
October or early November, said  Andrew Chaveriat , a New York-
based technical analyst at BNP.  “A close above $1.32 increases the odds that we’ll go up
to $1.40 over the next few months,” Chaveriat said in a
telephone interview. “It’s an indication of the strength of the
euro, of the longer-term trend.”  The euro added 1.6 percent to $1.3265 as of 4:52 p.m. in
New York, from $1.3061 yesterday. It last traded at $1.40 on
Feb. 3.  The euro could strengthen to $1.33 or $1.34 as early as
this week, Chaveriat said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
