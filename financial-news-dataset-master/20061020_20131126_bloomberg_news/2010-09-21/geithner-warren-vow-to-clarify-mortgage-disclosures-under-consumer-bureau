Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and consumer-protection adviser  Elizabeth Warren ,
starting to build the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
said they would work to clarify mortgage documents for
homeowners.  “Disclosure isn’t going to solve all problems, but it is
one of the most powerful tools we have for getting people better
information so they can make better choices about how they
borrow,” Geithner, 49, said at a Treasury forum today. The goal
is to “figure out how to, starting with mortgages, bring a
little more simplicity and clarity to the existing forms that
are out there,” he said.  Warren, seated alongside Geithner, said the meeting with
experts from consumer-advocate groups and lenders was aimed at
getting ideas “about what information consumers need and when
they need it to make the best possible financial decisions.”  Warren, 61, a Harvard Law School professor, was appointed
by President  Barack Obama  on Sept. 17 to serve as presidential
assistant and special adviser to Geithner, reporting to the
Treasury. The adviser position allows Warren to avoid a Senate
confirmation battle and immediately influence the agency she’s
credited with proposing.  “Too often, families come to understand the legalese only
when they get bitten by it,” she said. “This is particularly
true in the mortgage market, where borrowers receive stacks of
incomprehensible paperwork when they’re looking for a loan.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
