India, the second-biggest cotton
producer and exporter, may boost its limit on shipments as
output surges to a record next year, according to a growers
association.  Production will gain to 34.5 million bales, the highest
ever, Nayan Mirani, vice president of Cotton Association of
India, representing 450 growers, ginners and traders across the
nation, said in an interview in Lubbock, Texas. This year’s crop
is estimated at 29.5 million bales, according to India’s Cotton
Advisory Board’s August estimate.  “There is a possibility the government will increase the
export limit at the next review meeting in November,” Mirani
said.  India said it would limit cotton exports to 5.5 million
bales in the year beginning Oct. 1 in a bid to meet domestic
demand. A “prohibitive” duty will be imposed on shipments
above that level, Commerce Secretary  Rahul Khullar  said on Sept.
4. Textile Secretary Rita Menon said on Sept. 14 that the
country plans to delay registration of export contracts by two
weeks until Oct. 1  Cotton prices have surged 61 percent in the past year as
textile mills stepped up buying amid falling inventories. The
fiber is the best performing commodity in the last 12 months
among the 26 tracked by the UBS Bloomberg CMCI Index.  Futures for December delivery gained 1.42 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $1.0079 a pound on ICE Futures U.S.
Earlier, the price touched $1.0237, the highest level for a
most-active contract since June 1995.  An Indian bale weighs 170 kilograms (375 pounds).  To contact the reporters on this story:
