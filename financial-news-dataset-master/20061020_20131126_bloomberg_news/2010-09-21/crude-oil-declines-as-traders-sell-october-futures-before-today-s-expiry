Oil fell in New York as traders
sold the October future that expires today after short-term
supply concerns dissipated because Enbridge Energy Partners LP
started a pipeline supplying the U.S. Midwest.  Crude retraced part of its 1.6 percent gain yesterday as
traders sold contracts after buying last week to cover the
threat of supply disruptions caused by the shutdown of Enbridge
Energy Partners’ 6A, which carries 670,000 barrels a day, or
about one-third of Midwest imports. The line resumed Sept. 17.  “Only the front month, or October contract, is very
weak,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity derivative sales manager
at broker Newedge in Tokyo. “Traders want to see the next month
contract and that is unchanged. After Enbridge restarted that
put a lot of pressure on the front month.”  The October contract for West Texas Intermediate oil
dropped as much as 67 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $74.19 a barrel
in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and
was at $74.23 at 1:43 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday it climbed
$1.20 to $74.86, the biggest gain since Sept. 10. Prices are
down 6.4 percent this year.  The more active November future was at $75.97 a barrel,
down 22 cents.  Concerns about the rate of U.S. economic expansion are
holding back gains in crude markets. The worst recession in the
country since the Great Depression ended in June 2009, the
National Bureau of Economic Research said yesterday. The group
didn’t conclude that the “economy has returned to operating at
normal capacity,” it said.  The U.S. is the world’s largest oil consumer, using 19.5
million barrels a day of fuels in the week ended Sept. 10.  Brent Premium  Brent crude oil for November settlement traded at $79.21,
down 11 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
It rose $1.11, or 1.4 percent, to $79.32 yesterday.  The grade’s premium to the New York November contract has
climbed to $3.27 a barrel today from $3.13 yesterday.  European gasoil futures for October traded on London’s ICE
exchange are at a premium of $1.25 to November, a situation
known as backwardation where prompt supplies are more expensive
than later deliveries. This suggests an increase in demand for
oil products.  “Relatively, the products in Europe are much stronger than
the U.S.,” Hasegawa said. “You’re seeing cash gasoline markets
in Chicago falling down after the Enbridge restart. That’s the
difference between the U.S. and European markets and that
reflects the large difference between WTI and Brent.”  An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
that stockpiles of distillate fuel, including heating oil and
diesel, increased 250,000 barrels last week, a Bloomberg News
survey shows, the first increase in four weeks.  U.S. crude supplies probably slipped 1.6 million barrels
from 357.4 million, according to the survey. Gasoline stockpiles
decreased 250,000 barrels from 224.5 million, the survey shows.  Refineries probably operated at 86.8 percent of capacity,
down 0.8 percentage point from the previous week, according to
the survey. It would be the lowest utilization rate since the
week ended April 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
