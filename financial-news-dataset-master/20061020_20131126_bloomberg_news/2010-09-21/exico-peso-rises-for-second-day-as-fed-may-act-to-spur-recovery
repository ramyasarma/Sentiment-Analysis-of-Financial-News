Mexico’s peso gained for a second
day on speculation that the Federal Reserve may act today to
bolster the economic recovery.  The peso increased 0.1 percent to 12.7583 per dollar at
10:11 a.m. New York time, from 12.7739 yesterday. The currency
has gained 2.5 percent this year against the dollar. The peso
has risen nine of the last 10 days.  The market is “waiting for the Fed’s decision,” said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico
City. “Any changes by the Fed are going to be expressed
directly, and pretty quickly, in the peso.”  The Fed will probably maintain its pledge to keep interest
rates low for an “extended period” and keep a $2.05 trillion
floor on its holdings of securities, said economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News from Sept. 16 to 17.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.62 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 0.15 centavo to
131.06 centavos per peso.  Retail sales rose 2 percent in July from a year earlier,
the national statistics agency said, below the median estimate
of 2.2 percent in a Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts.  Housing starts in the U.S., Mexico’s largest trading
partner, rose more than forecast in August, the Commerce
Department said today in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
