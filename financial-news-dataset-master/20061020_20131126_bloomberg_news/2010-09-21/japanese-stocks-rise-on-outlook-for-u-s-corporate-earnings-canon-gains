Japanese  stocks  fell as China-
related shares declined after Beijing restricted diplomatic
contacts between the nations and as the yen strengthened ahead
of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting.  Komatsu Ltd. , which counts China as its biggest market,
lost 1 percent. Mazda Motor Corp., which counts North America as
its biggest market outside of Japan, lost 2.4 percent as the yen
rose against the dollar today. Acom Co. surged 17 percent on
speculation consumer lenders will benefit from a drop in claims
for over-charged interest.  “The China-Japan relations issue will put negative
pressure on market sentiment,” said  Kazuhiro Takahashi , a
general manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa Securities Capital Markets
Co. “If the FOMC surprises the market by more monetary easing,
we may see a weak-dollar, strong-yen situation again.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.3 percent to 9,602.11
at the close of trading in Tokyo, reversing an earlier gain of
as much as 0.8 percent. The broader Topix declined 0.3 percent
to 849.94, with about three shares falling for every two that
advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
