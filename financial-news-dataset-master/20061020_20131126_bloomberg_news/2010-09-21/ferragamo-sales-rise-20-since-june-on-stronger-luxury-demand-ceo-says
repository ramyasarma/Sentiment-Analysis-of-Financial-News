Salvatore Ferragamo SpA , the
Italian shoemaker, said sales have risen more than 20 percent
since the end of June as shoppers who were cautious last year
snapped up $1,200 lace-up boots and $2,850 woven calfskin
handbags.  Luxury spending has returned more quickly than expected,
Chief Executive Officer  Michele Norsa  said in a phone interview.
Sales in the Florence, Italy-based company’s stores are
“reacting even more quickly than wholesale,” Norsa said. He
declined to provide growth rates by channel.  Sales of luxury goods are recovering as shoppers spend more
and distributors restock inventories after the industry’s worst
year on record. Companies including  Hermes International SCA  and
Prada SpA posted double-digit revenue growth in the six months
through June. Ferragamo’s sales grew more than 10 percent from
February through May, Norsa said in July.  Post-recession luxury consumers are “looking for a product
they can use for longer,” Norsa said. “There’s also a price
consciousness that didn’t used to be there.”  Ferragamo’s third-quarter revenue growth is benefiting from
a weak comparison basis, Norsa said. Growth may slow down in the
fourth quarter because sales began to recover in the final three
months of last year, the CEO said.  For the full year, “I’m reasonably confident but there are
a lot of volatile elements for which I think it’s sensible not
to make forecasts,” Norsa said, adding that favorable exchange
rates may boost second-half earnings.  Ferragamo has about 570 stores around the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
