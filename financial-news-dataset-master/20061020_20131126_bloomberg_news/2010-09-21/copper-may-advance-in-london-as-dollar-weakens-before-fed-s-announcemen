Copper may rise in New York and
London as the dollar weakens before today’s conclusion of a
meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell as much as 0.5 percent, making
dollar-priced metals cheaper in terms of other monies. The U.S.
central bank probably will leave its target rate for overnight
loans between banks at a record low, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “All is quiet ahead of the Fed meeting,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London. “A weaker
dollar is supportive to most commodity prices, including base
metals.”  Copper for delivery in December rose 0.7 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $3.5115 a pound at 8:48 a.m. on the Comex in New
York after gaining as much as 0.7 percent. Copper for delivery
in three months advanced 0.1 percent to $7,720 a metric ton on
the London Metal Exchange.  The Fed is scheduled to announce its decision at about 2:15
p.m. in Washington. The benchmark interest rate has been in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month forecast the central
bank will hold that rate until late 2011.  “The Fed statement will be closely watched as well for
hints on quantitative easing,” Kryuchenkov said, referring to
debt purchases by the central bank.  Housing Starts  Builders in the U.S. broke ground on more homes in July
than estimated by economists, government figures showed, helping
to support prices. Housing starts gained 10.5 percent to a
598,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said, above the
550,000 estimated in a Bloomberg News survey. The country is the
world’s second-largest copper consumer after China.  “The data suggest that the U.S. housing sector is slowly
pulling itself off the canvas after a knockout punch,” said
 David Thurtell , a Citigroup Inc. analyst in London. Construction
accounts for a quarter of copper demand, according to the  Copper
Development Association .  LME copper stockpiles fell for a fifth day to 380,025 tons,
the lowest level since Nov. 5, daily exchange figures show.
Orders to draw copper from inventories, or canceled warrants,
rose 0.8 percent to 29,175 tons. One party held between 30
percent and 39 percent of the inventory and a second accounted
for between 40 percent and 49 percent as of Sept. 17, according
to exchange figures.  Inventories Contract  Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined to the lowest level in 11 months, according to
data from the bourse. Inventories fell 3.9 percent to 94,365
tons, the exchange said today. That’s the lowest level since the
week ended Oct. 9, 2009. Financial markets in China, the world’s
largest metals user, are closed from Sept. 20 to Sept. 24 for
the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.  The copper market was in deficit by 281,000 tons in the
year’s first half, more than double the year-earlier 125,000
tons, the International Copper Study Group said today.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME fell 0.9 percent to
$23,250 a ton. Prices last week reached $23,800, the highest
intraday level since July 16, 2008. The metal is this year’s
best LME performer, adding 37 percent, compared with the 24
percent advance by closest rival nickel.  Tin, which touched a record $25,500 a ton in May 2008, has
been bolstered by disruptions to production in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Indonesia.  Too Much Aluminum  Aluminum advanced 0.5 percent to $2,205 a ton. A “clear
oversupply” of the lightweight metal is the industry’s “main
challenge,” Norsk Hydro ASA, the world’s fifth-largest
producer, said today.  “We are still very worried about the U.S.,” Executive
Vice President Arvid Moss said. “Demand driven by the
infrastructure investments there will now gradually be less.”  Construction and transportation make up about 40 percent of
global aluminum demand, according to researcher CRU.  A market surplus of the metal will shrink this year to
385,000 tons from 1.1 million tons in 2009, according to
Barclays Capital. Next year the surplus will swell to 553,000
tons, the bank said in a report on Sept. 16. Aluminum usage will
rise 8.4 percent this year in North America, Barclays Capital
said, below its estimate for a 13 percent global gain.  Nickel slipped 0.5 percent to $22,950 a ton, lead declined
1.6 percent to $2,160 a ton and zinc fell 0.8 percent to $2,162
a ton.  To contact the reporter on the story:
