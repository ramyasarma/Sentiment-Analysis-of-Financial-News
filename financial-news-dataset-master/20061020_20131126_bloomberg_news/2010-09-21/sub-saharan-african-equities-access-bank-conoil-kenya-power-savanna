a fourth day, gaining 6 kobo, or 0.8 percent, to 7.5 naira. The
bank forecast net income of 2.22 billion naira ($312.1 million)
for the fourth quarter through December, according to Dapo
Olangunju, the company’s treasurer.  Conoil Plc  (CONOIL NL), a Nigerian fuel retailer, fell to a
six-month low, losing 1.62 naira, or 4 percent, to 39 naira, on
speculation of concern about a lack of policy direction in the
Nigerian oil industry, Meristem Stockbrokers Ltd. said.  “Investors want to have a clear idea of what the government
plans to do with the oil and gas industry bill, and the pricing
of petroleum products,” Abiola Razaq, a Lagos-based analyst with
Meristem, said by phone today. “The outlook is not clear and
this is weighing down prices in that sector.”  Kenya Power & Lighting Ltd.  (KPLL KN), the East African
country’s only electricity distributor, advanced to the highest
level in three years, climbing 6 shillings, or 2.5 percent, to
251 shillings. Kenya and the African Development Bank signed a
3.97 billion-shilling ($48.83 million) agreement to build a line
power line to neighboring Uganda, Kenyan Finance Minister Uhuru
Kenyatta told reporters in Nairobi, the capital, yesterday.  The accord is part of a 16 billion-shilling program to
boost electricity supplies in Kenya, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, Kenyatta said.  Savannah Sugar Estates Co.  (SAVA MP), a Mauritian cane
grower with interests in property development, dropped the most
since July 2002, retreating 9.5 rupees, or 18 percent, to 42.5
rupees, on speculation a 64 percent surge last week was
overdone. The shares rallied from Sept. 14 to Sept. 17 after a
20-for-1 stock split as investors tried to benefit from
liquidity in the shares. Prices have “corrected” following last
week’s advance, Imrith Ramtohul, head of investment at the
Mauritius Union Insurance said in a phone interview from Port
Louis today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
