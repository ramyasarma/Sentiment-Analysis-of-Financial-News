Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender, expects to focus on Hong Kong and Singapore as
it expands wealth-management businesses in emerging markets.  “Hong Kong is going to be an important one, the Singapore
market will be another important one,” said  Mike Lagopoulos , a
deputy chairman at RBC Wealth Management. “Those are the two
big private-wealth markets.”  Lagopoulos, 53, said expansion will come from a combination
of acquisitions and organic growth. He didn’t elaborate.  Royal Bank, based in Toronto, said in a memo to clients
last week it’s adding a fourth wealth-management unit effective
Nov. 1 focusing on emerging markets. Wealth Management accounted
for 14 percent of the bank’s C$1.28 billion ($1.25 billion) in
 profit  in the fiscal third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
