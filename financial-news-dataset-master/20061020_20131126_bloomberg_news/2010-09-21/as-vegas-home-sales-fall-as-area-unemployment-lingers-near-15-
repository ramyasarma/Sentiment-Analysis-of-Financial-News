Las Vegas home sales fell in August
after a federal tax incentive for buyers expired and the
region’s unemployment rate remained at almost 15 percent, MDA
DataQuick said today.  The number of houses and condominiums sold in the Las
Vegas-Paradise area dropped to 4,270, a decline of 9.5 percent
from a year earlier, the San Diego-based research company said.
New-home sales slumped to the lowest level for an August since
1994, when MDA DataQuick’s records begin. Transactions involving
previously owned homes declined 13 percent.  The unemployment rate in Nevada’s Clark County, home to Las
Vegas, was 14.7 percent last month, according to the state’s
 employment department . That’s above the 9.6 percent U.S. rate.
Home sales in Las Vegas and across the country also are being
hurt by the end of the tax credit. Buyers had to sign a contract
by the end of April to receive a benefit of as much as $8,000.  “Now the pressure is off,”  Andrew LePage , an MDA DataQuick
analyst, said in an interview. “People know the job market is
still soft and the economy hasn’t gained much steam, so what’s
the rush?”  The median home price in the Las Vegas area was $130,000 in
August, little changed from both a year earlier and July.  MDA DataQuick is a unit of Richmond, British Columbia-based
 MacDonald Dettwiler & Associates Ltd.  It compiles surveys using
county records and supplies real estate information to customers
including public agencies, lenders and title companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
