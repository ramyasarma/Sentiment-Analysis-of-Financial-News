A U.S. appeals court panel has
vacated the dismissal of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s suit accusing Mark Cuban of insider trading in the
sale of his Mamma.com stake.  The ruling voiding a decision to throw out the SEC’s suit
against Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks
basketball team, was issued by a three-judge panel of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
