HSBC  Holdings  Plc Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Geoghegan  threatened to resign if he wasn’t
promoted to chairman, the Financial Times reported, citing two
people familiar with the bank’s succession planning.  Douglas Flint , the bank’s finance director, and  John Thornton , a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, are among
possible candidates to succeed  Stephen Green  as chairman, the
report said.  If Geoghegan resigns, the favorite to replace him as CEO is
 Stuart Gulliver , head of the company’s investment bank, the
report said.  HSBC London-based spokesman  Adrian Russell  declined to
comment on the report.  “HSBC has previously announced it expects to be in a
position to announce a successor by the end of the year,”
Russell said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
