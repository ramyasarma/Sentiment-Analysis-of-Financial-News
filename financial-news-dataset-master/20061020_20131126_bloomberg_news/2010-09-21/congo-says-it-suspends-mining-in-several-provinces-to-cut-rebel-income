The  Democratic Republic of Congo’s 
Mines Minister  Martin Kabwelulu  said a mining suspension in
three eastern provinces will be upheld “until further notice”
in a bid to starve rebels in the area of income from minerals.  The suspension, announced by President  Joseph Kabila  on
Sept. 11, put a halt to mining in North and South Kivu provinces
and Maniema, which are rich in tin, gold, wolfram, and columbo-
tantalum, which is used in the production of mobile phones.  Canadian gold mining company  Banro Corp.  is exempt from the
suspension, Kabwelulu told reporters today in the capital,
Kinshasa. Banro holds four licenses in Congo’s South Kivu and
Maniema provinces, the company said on Sept. 14.  Congo is under pressure to prevent its minerals and other
natural resources from supporting armed groups. Various rebel
groups and the army control mines in the provinces and use
revenue from the industry to fund their activities.  The  Central African nation  is piloting attempts to certify
minerals as “conflict free” in line with standards demanded by
activists and new U.S. legislation.  Separately, Kabwelulu said Congo’s state-owned diamond
miner, La Societe Miniere de Bakwanga, needs between $150
million and $200 million to restart production. Output was
halted in November 2008 for the first time in more than a
century because of low gem prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
