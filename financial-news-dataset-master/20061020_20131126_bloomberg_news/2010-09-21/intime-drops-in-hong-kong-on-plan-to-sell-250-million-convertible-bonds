Intime Department Store (Group) Co. ,
a Chinese retail chain partly owned by Warburg Pincus LLC, fell
the most in four months in Hong Kong trading after saying it
plans to sell convertible bonds.  Intime  declined  3.7 percent to HK$10.02, in Hong Kong
trading, the biggest drop since May 25. The benchmark Hang Seng
Index rose 0.1 percent.  The retailer hired Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley
and UBS AG to manage the HK$1.94 billion ($250 million) sale of
1.75 percent convertible notes, it said in a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange today. The  bonds , due 2013, can be
handed over for shares when the stock price rises 28 percent
from yesterday’s closing price of HK$10.40.  The three-year notes will be priced to yield 4 percent,
according to a separate statement sent to investors.  Warburg Pincus last month said it planned to sell as much
as a third of its stake in the Chinese department-store operator,
according to a term sheet seen by Bloomberg. The U.S. private-
equity firm held about 9 percent of the stock as of Aug. 25,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Intime has said it plans to build 10 outlets in Beijing
over the next five years to tap increasing consumer demand in
the world’s most populous nation.  Today’s  decline  pared Intime’s  surge  this year to 40
percent, compared with a 0.6 percent advance for the benchmark.  To contact the reporters on this story:
