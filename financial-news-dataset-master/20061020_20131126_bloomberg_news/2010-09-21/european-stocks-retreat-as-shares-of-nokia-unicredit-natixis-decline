European stocks fell, as declines
in shares of Nokia Oyj and UniCredit SpA overshadowed easing
concern about the region’s sovereign debt and a better-than-
estimated report on the U.S. housing market.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.3 percent to
265.52 at 4:28 p.m. in London. Nokia fell 4.5 percent, while
UniCredit lost 1.9 percent. Natixis tumbled 4.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
