Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , the
bankrupt investment bank, requested court approval of an
agreement with  Societe Generale  that would give the estate at
least $445 million.  The accord relates to swap transactions with two special-
purpose entities, according to court papers filed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan.  “The settlement agreement avoids the inherent risk for the
debtors in the current litigation against SG,” New York-based
Lehman said in the filing. The  creditors’  committee supports the
accord, court papers show.  If the deal is approved, Lehman could potentially recover
about $72 million more. The agreement would allow Lehman to
pursue the remaining assets in Libra CDO Ltd. and MKP Vela CBO
Ltd. against other parties to the swap transactions.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
