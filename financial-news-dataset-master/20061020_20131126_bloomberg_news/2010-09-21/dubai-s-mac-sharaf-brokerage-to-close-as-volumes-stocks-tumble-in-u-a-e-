MAC Sharaf Securities LLC , a Dubai-
based brokerage, has sought approval from the market regulator
to halt operations for a year, joining more than 12 companies
making similar requests after volumes and stocks slumped.  “We have decided to voluntarily suspend operations of the
brokerage business as we review the market over the next year,”
 Gerhard Hametner , MAC Sharaf’s marketing manager, said in a
phone interview today. “Volumes have not been sufficient enough
to sustain brokerage firms in the market for some time.” MAC
Sharaf has 25 employees, Hametner said.  The  volume of shares  traded in Dubai plummeted to a daily
average of 160 million this year from 457 million in the year-
earlier period. Dubai’s  benchmark index  of 32 stocks slumped 80
percent to 1,701.15 at the close today after reaching a record
in November 2005.  Twelve brokerages in the United Arab Emirates submitted
requests to the Securities and Commodities Authority to suspend
operations this year, Ibrahim Obeid Al-Zaabi, deputy chief
executive officer for licensing, supervision and enforcement,
said Aug. 4. Five companies received approval to shut and their
licenses have been suspended for one year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
