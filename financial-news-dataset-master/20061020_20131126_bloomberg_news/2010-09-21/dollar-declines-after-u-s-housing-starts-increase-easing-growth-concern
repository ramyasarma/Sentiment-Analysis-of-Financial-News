The dollar declined against the
euro and the yen before a Federal Reserve meeting where policy
makers may set the stage for additional steps to boost the
economy.  Japan’s currency weakened against the euro as housing
starts in the U.S. rose more than forecast in August, easing
concern the recovery is faltering and boosting appetite for
higher-yielding assets. The euro rallied versus the greenback to
nearly a six-week high after investors bought the maximum
amounts offered at Spanish and Irish debt sales, reducing
concern the region’s sovereign debt crisis will worsen. The
Australian dollar reached its highest level since July 2008.  “There is little momentum in the economy at this point,”
 Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. rates strategy for fixed income
and currencies at the primary dealer Royal Bank of Canada in New
York, wrote in a note to clients. “But unless Bernanke gave us
a half-baked view in Jackson Hole, it’s not about the
unemployment rate or growth in general. It’s about inflation.
Specifically, if deflation risks rise meaningfully, that would
set another round of QE in motion.”  The dollar fell 0.5 percent to 1.3129 per euro as of 1:37
p.m. in New York, from 1.3061 yesterday. The yen weakened 0.1
percent to 112.04 euro from 111.93 and strengthened 0.4 percent
to 85.32 against the dollar from 85.69.  Fed Moves  A survey by Jersey, City, New Jersey-based Ried Thunberg
found that 57 percent don’t expect the Fed to announce
additional asset purchases, while 43 percent expect policy
makers to say they’re resuming quantitative easing.  The Fed will keep its benchmark rate in a range of zero and
0.25 percent at today’s meeting, where it has been since
December 2008, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Fifty-four of 63
economists surveyed said the central bank will leave unchanged a
sentence saying high unemployment and low inflation warrant
“exceptionally low” rates.  U.S. builders broke ground on 598,000 homes at an annual
rate, up 10.5 percent and the most since April, following a
541,000 pace in July, the Commerce Department said today in
Washington.  Housing starts  were forecast to rise 0.7 percent to
550,000, according to the median estimate of 74 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Behind the Numbers  “They were surprisingly good numbers,” said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales  at Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. in New York. “Dollar-yen had moved a little bit lower
overnight, but has since gotten a boost. At the same time, it
seems to be more risk-on.”  Ireland sold 1.5 billion euros ($1.97 billion) in a bond
auction, the  National Treasury Management Agency  said today.
Spain sold 7 billion euros of 12-month and 18-month bills, the
maximum target, the Bank of Spain said. Greece sold 390 million
euros of 13-week Treasury bills at a yield of 3.98 percent, the
Athens-based Public Debt Management Agency said.  “European developments are helping the euro today,”  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo & Co. in
New York, wrote in a note to clients. The euro is boosted as
“debt market concerns ease after successful government debt
auctions today.”  The Swiss franc weakened against the euro after the
European bond auctions sapped demand for the currency’s relative
safety.  The franc fell 0.6 percent against the euro to 1.3201, from
$1.3125.  Aussie Gains  Australia’s currency declined 0.1 percent at 94.62 U.S.
cents, from 94.72 cents yesterday. It touched 95.02 cents, the
strongest level since July 2008.  Reserve Bank of Australia policy makers signaled they may
need to raise interest rates given the pace of the nation’s
economic expansion.  The yuan climbed to the highest level since 1993 after
President  Barack Obama  criticized China for not letting it
strengthen. It advanced before scheduled talks between Obama and
Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  at this week’s United Nations General
Assembly in New York.  China’s leaders haven’t done “everything they said would
be done” to allow appreciation, Obama said yesterday at an
hour-long town hall discussion in Washington.  Yuan Gains  The yuan gained 0.1 percent to 6.7061 per dollar, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System.  The yen advanced against the dollar as concern that
Japanese officials would resume selling it eased.  Japan intervened in foreign exchange markets on Sept. 15
for the first time since 2004 to protect its exporters after the
yen rose to a 15-year high against the dollar. While that helped
the currency slump 3.3 percent on the day, it has climbed 0.3
percent since then.  The Canadian dollar weakened against the greenback after a
report showed inflation in August unexpectedly fell, raising
speculation that the Bank of Canada will pause in its cycle of
interest-rate increases when policy makers meet next month.  The consumer price index fell 0.1 percent in August, and
rose 1.7 percent from a year ago following July’s 1.8 percent
gain, Statistics Canada reported.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known, depreciated
0.2 percent to C$1.0307 per U.S. dollar from C$1.0282 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
