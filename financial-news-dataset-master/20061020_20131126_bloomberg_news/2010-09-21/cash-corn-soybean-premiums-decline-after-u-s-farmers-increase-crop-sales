Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans declined relative
to Chicago futures as U.S. farmers increased deliveries of newly
harvested crops and export shipments slowed.  The spot-basis  bid , or premium, for corn delivered in
September was 17 cents to 23 cents a bushel above December
futures, compared with 20 cents to 40 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data showed. Soybean premiums fell to
50 cents to 54 cents above November futures, compared with 50
cents to 63 cents yesterday.  “The big push on harvest is just ahead,” said  Scott Stoller , a grain merchandiser at Michlig Agricenter Inc. in
Manlius, Illinois. “There is just not much new business now,
and most commercials have enough supplies coming in.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 3 cents, or 0.6
percent, to close at $5.0525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price fell 1 percent yesterday after reaching
$5.2375, the highest level for the most-active contract since
September 2008.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 4.5 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $10.80 a bushel. Yesterday, the oilseed reached
$10.995, the highest level since June 2009.  Corn fields that matured later are yielding better crops,
which will add to supplies in the next several weeks, Stoller
said.  The crop was rated 68 percent good or excellent as of Sept.
19, equal to last year, the USDA said yesterday. About 63
percent of the soybeans got the top ratings.  “The yield variability in corn is very high this year, and
that should keep a floor under prices,” Stoller said. “Farmers
are harvesting record soybean crops.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
