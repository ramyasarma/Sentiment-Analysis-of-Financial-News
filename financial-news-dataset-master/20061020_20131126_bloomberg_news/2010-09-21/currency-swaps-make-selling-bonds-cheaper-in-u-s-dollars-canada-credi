TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.  and
Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. sold debt in U.S. dollars
yesterday as currency swap rates rose, making it cheaper for
Canadian firms to raise money outside the country.  TransCanada, which operates more than 60,000 kilometers
(37,000 miles) of natural gas pipeline in Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, paid 112.5 basis points above Treasuries to sell $1
billion of debt due in 10 years.  Canadian Pacific , which
generates about a third of revenue in the U.S., sold $350
million of 4.45 percent bonds due in March 2023 that paid a 178
basis-point spread.  Canadian firms with operations south of the border are
taking advantage of favorable conditions to tap U.S. debt
markets, with corporate yields near two-decade lows and spreads
tightening. The extra yield investors demand to hold the debt of
U.S. investment-grade companies instead of Treasuries has
tightened to 183 basis points from 213 basis points in June and
656 in December 2008.  “It’s definitely, on an all-in cost basis, attractive for
them to go to the U.S. markets,”  Jason Parker , head of fixed-
income research at Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets, said
by phone from Toronto. “In the case of TransCanada, they have
significant business in the U.S., it makes sense for them to
have part of their issuance outstanding in U.S. dollars, so they
look at both sides of the border and then tap whichever one
makes sense to them.”  Basis Swaps  Swap markets are pricing in a higher premium to borrow in
Canadian dollars compared with U.S. dollars, according to cross-
currency basis swap rates. The premium a borrower would need to
add to three-month Canadian-dollar bankers’ acceptances in
exchange for three-month U.S. dollar Libor over five years
touched 18 basis points last week, the most since October.  Although swap rates are making it less expensive for
Canadian companies to issue in U.S. dollars, total costs still
favor issuing in Canadian dollars for most companies, according
to National Bank of Canada data.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own Canadian corporate bonds instead of government
debt ended yesterday at 146 basis points, or 1.46 percentage
points, the narrowest since Aug. 30. Spreads on Merrill’s Global
Broad Market Corporate Index were unchanged yesterday at 171
basis points.  Overall yields for Canada company debt fell to 3.82 percent
yesterday, compared with 3.57 percent for the broad index. The
gap reached 29 basis points on Sept. 15, the most since April.  Ontario  Provincial bonds’ relative yields tightened yesterday by 1
basis point to 55 basis points. The debt of the 10 Canadian
provinces, with about C$277 billion outstanding, has lost 0.74
percent in September, compared with losses of 0.9 percent for
governments and 0.75 percent for corporates.  Ontario plans to sell 10-year bonds in euros that may be
priced to yield 33 to 35 basis points more than the benchmark
mid-swap rate, according to a banker involved in the deal.
Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. are managing the sale, the banker said.  The cost of living increased less than forecast last month.
Statistics Canada reported the consumer price index fell 0.1
percent in August, and rose 1.7 percent from a year ago
following July’s 1.8 percent gain. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the price index would be unchanged during
August and the annual rate would accelerate to 1.9 percent,
according to the median of 16 estimates.  Breakevens  Canadian 10-year breakeven  rates , which measure the
difference in yield between inflation-linked and cash bonds and
gauges price expectations, dropped to 2.04 percent today, after
rising to 2.52 percent in January and slumping to 1.85 percent
in July. The  spread  of Canadian 10-year breakeven rates over
U.S. rates tightened 3 basis points to 24 after today’s report.  The Canadian dollar basis swap  rate  reached 17.5 basis
points on Sept. 14, the highest since October 2009. That’s up
from as low as 4.75 basis points in May, with an average of 11
basis points since February 2000, when Bloomberg started
tracking it.  The Canadian currency has strengthened 2.2 percent to
C$1.0309 per U.S. dollar this year. One Canadian dollar buys 97
U.S. cents.  Companies based in Canada have sold $6.6 billion of debt
denominated in U.S. dollars in September, the second-busiest
month of 2010. Issuers sold $7.98 billion of the debt in July
and $1.4 billion in August.  AbitibiBowater Inc.  sold $850 million of 10.25 percent
notes due in October 2018, Bloomberg data show. The largest
newsprint maker in North America, based in Montreal, won court
approval last month to borrow as much as $1.35 billion to help
fund its exit from bankruptcy.  ‘Very Favorable’  TransCanada gets about a third of its pipeline earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from U.S.
operations. The Calgary-based firm also operates power
generating stations and  natural-gas  storage facilities. It paid
137.5 basis points in May to sell $500 million of debt due in
2015, and 200 basis points to issue $750 million of 6.1 percent
bonds due in 2040.  Proceeds from Canadian Pacific’s debt sale, “combined with
general corporate funds, will be used for a voluntary prepayment
in 2010 of up to C$650 million to the company’s defined benefits
pension plans,” the Calgary-based firm said in a statement.  A call to TransCanada’s investor relations department
wasn’t returned.  BMO’s Parker anticipates more Canadian companies issuing
U.S. dollar debt, particularly those such as oil and gas firms
with cross-border operations.  “In the currency environment, where things look very
favorable you’re going to have companies looking to get the
money when the can,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
