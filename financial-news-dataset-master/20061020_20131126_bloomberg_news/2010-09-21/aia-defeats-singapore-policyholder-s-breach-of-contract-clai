American International Assurance
Co., won dismissal of a lawsuit by a Singapore policyholder who
sought S$1.95 million ($1.46 million) for breach of contract.  Singapore High Court Judge  Tan Lee Meng  upheld an earlier
dismissal and struck out another claim by Zhu Yong Zhen who also
alleged that her former lawyer colluded with the insurer against
her, according to a ruling released publicly today.  “Madam Zhu obviously did not understand the role of the
courts in the litigation process,” Tan wrote, noting that she
also complained that the assistant registrar who made a number
of orders against her had sabotaged her case.  Zhu’s dispute with AIA was related to policies the American
International Group Inc. unit sold between 1986 and 1994 with a
feature under which the policy would accumulate enough dividends
so that a holder would be covered without paying further
premiums, according to the judgment. AIA announced a  plan  for
other affected policyholders in 2003.  Zhu declined to participate in that process and in August
2008 proposed to AIA that their dispute be settled by the
insurer investing S$1.5 million in a health supplement business
she planned, according to the ruling.  A policy benefit illustration document shown to Zhu was not
part of her contract, Judge Tan ruled.  The case is Zhu Yong Zhen v. American International
Assurance Co. Ltd. anor S515/2009 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
