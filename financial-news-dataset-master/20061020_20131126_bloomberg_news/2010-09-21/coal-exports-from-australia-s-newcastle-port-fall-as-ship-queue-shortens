             Coal shipments from Australia’s
Newcastle, the world’s biggest export harbor for the power-
station fuel, fell by 2.2 percent last week while the queue of
vessels waiting to load shortened.  
 The volume exported in the week ended 7 a.m. local time
yesterday dropped to 1.94 million metric tons from 1.98 million
tons in the preceding period, Newcastle Port Corp. said on its
website today.  
 Rio Tinto Group,  Xstrata Plc  and BHP Billiton Ltd. are
among mining companies that ship the fuel from the harbor, which
has three export terminals. Seven vessels were outside the port,
down from 12 a week earlier, while the waiting period averaged
14.35 days, little changed from 14.34, the report said.  
 Power-station coal prices at Newcastle, an Asian benchmark,
rose 4.5 percent, according to the  globalCOAL  NEWC Index. Prices
climbed to $97.07 a ton in the week ended Sept. 17, from $92.90
in the previous period.
