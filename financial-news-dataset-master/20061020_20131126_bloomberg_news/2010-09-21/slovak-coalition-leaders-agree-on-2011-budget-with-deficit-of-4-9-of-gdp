Slovak coalition parties agreed on
the 2011 budget that seeks to cut the fiscal shortfall in the
east European euro-region member by a third, Prime Minister
Iveta Radicova said.  The  deficit  is projected to narrow to 4.9 percent of gross
domestic product from an expected 7.8 percent of GDP this year,
Radicova told journalists today in the Slovak capital
Bratislava. The budget includes spending cuts worth 980 million
euros ($1.3 billion), while an additional 770 million euros in
revenue will be raised through a 1 percentage point increase in
value-added tax and other measures, she said.  The Cabinet will discuss some of the austerity measures,
on which the budget is based, as early as tomorrow, she said.
The government is obliged to approve the budget and submit it to
parliament by Oct. 15.  Radicova’s administration, in power since July, seeks to
minimize the impact of austerity measures on the economy, which
has resumed growth this year after slipping into its first-ever
 recession  in 2009. Tightening of the deficit will cause economic
growth to slow to 3.3 percent from 4 percent this year,
according to the Finance Ministry’s forecast released Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
