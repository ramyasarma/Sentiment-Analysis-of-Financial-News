France’s  CAC 40 Index  declined 0.1
percent to 3,784.4 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Paris. The  SBF 120
Index  lost less than 0.1 percent.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
French equity today. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Air France-KLM Group  (AF FP), Europe’s largest airline,
gained 3.3 percent to 11.74 euros. The global airline industry
may post a combined profit of $8.9 billion in 2010, more than
triple an earlier forecast, as the economic recovery spurs
travel and carriers avoid over-expansion, the International Air
Transport Association said. Earnings will probably fall to $5.3
billion next year because of “razor-thin” profit margins, IATA
said in a statement today.  Legrand SA  (LR FP) lost 3.2 percent to 24.3 euros. KKR &
Co. LP and  Wendel  (MF FP) have sold a 9 percent stake in the
electrical equipment maker to institutional investors at 23.95
euros a share. The two investors retain about 36.5 percent of
the company and 52 percent of voting rights.  Natixis SA  (KN FP) slumped 4.7 percent to 4.35 euros after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the shares to “sell” from
“neutral.”  Safran SA  (SAF FP) rallied 5.8 percent to 21.57 euros. The
French maker of aerospace engines and equipment was upgraded to
“buy” from “neutral” at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.
The broker said an announcement last week from the families that
control 36 percent of the voting rights in Zodiac Aerospace,
which Safran is interested in buying, removes the risk of Safran
overpaying for Zodiac.  Zodiac Aerospace  (ZC FP) soared 5.9 percent to 49.64 euros.
The chief executive officer of the maker of aircraft equipment
and cabin interiors said that an aviation recovery is clearly
under way and that Zodiac will benefit both from sales of new
equipment and from sales of spare parts.  Olivier Zarrouati  said
that the company remains “absolutely convinced” that its
future will be brighter if it remains independent and doesn’t
get acquired by Safran, which has expressed interest.  Ubisoft Entertainment  (UBI FP), Europe’s biggest video-game
producer, rallied 7.4 percent to 7.96 euros. Goldman Sachs added
the shares to its “conviction buy” list, as it upgraded the
shares from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
