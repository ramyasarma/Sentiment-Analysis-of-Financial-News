The U.K. expects to receive its
first nuclear-planning applications next year so construction
can begin on new atomic-power facilities no later than 2013,
said  Charles Hendry , the country’s minister of state for energy.  The British government is following reactor financing deals
around the world to gauge the ability of companies to make a
profit from nuclear-power investments, Hendry said in an
interview today at the U.K. Embassy in Vienna. The  International
Atomic Energy Agency  warned yesterday that international
financial institutions have become reluctant to support nuclear-
power projects.  The U.K. has ruled out subsidizing nuclear construction and
is instead considering setting a minimum price for carbon. A so-
called carbon floor is seen as a way to stabilize electricity
prices, which would encourage construction of low-carbon energy
technologies including offshore wind and nuclear power.
Utilities may spend as much as 6 billion pounds ($9 billion) on
each reactor in Britain, according to Hendry.  Companies investing in U.K. atomic reactors, such as
 Electricite de France SA  and  Centrica Plc , will need to pledge
money for a nuclear-waste fund.  “We’re still discussing with industry what the exact price
of that will be,” Hendry said. “We have to make sure there is
no long-term, hidden subsidy” that will affect taxpayers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
