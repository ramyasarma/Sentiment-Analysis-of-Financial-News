             Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s moves to
weaken Japan’s currency and shake up his administration have
made him more popular as he seeks broader support for his
economic agenda after surviving a leadership challenge.  
 Kan’s approval surged 18 percentage points from August to
64 percent in a Sankei newspaper survey published today that
follows his Sept. 17 Cabinet reshuffle. He had similar gains in
polls conducted by other major newspapers, showing his highest
level of support since he took office in June.  
 Kan “looks a lot more like a leader now,” said  Jeff Kingston , head of Asian Studies at  Temple University’s Tokyo
campus . “It’s amazing how successful he’s been at re-inventing
himself.”  
 Japan sold the yen for the first time since March 2004 last
week, one day after Kan defeated rival Ichiro Ozawa in a
 Democratic Party of Japan  leadership race on Sept. 14. Increased
public support may bolster Kan’s bid to fulfill the DPJ’s
pledges to boost spending on social welfare without adding to
the world’s largest public  debt .  
 Approval for Kan’s administration rose 2 percentage points
from the previous week to 59 percent, according to an Asahi
 newspaper  poll published yesterday. A Yomiuri newspaper survey
on Sept. 19 put his support at 66 percent. The Mainichi
newspaper said the same day his approval rating climbed to 64
percent from 48 percent.  
 China Tensions  
 Voter support for Kan also comes amid mounting tensions
with China after Japan arrested the captain of a fishing boat
that collided with two Japanese Coast Guard vessels in disputed
waters. China has called for the immediate release of the
fisherman and on Sept. 19 severed senior-level government
contacts after Japanese prosecutors extended the captain’s
detention until Sept. 29.  
 After winning party elections to remain prime minister, Kan
vowed to “overcome the past 20 years of deflation, create a
strong economy and revive employment.” He said he is
considering additional stimulus steps including a supplementary
budget after unveiling a 915 billion yen ($10.7 billion)
economic package earlier this month.  
 Still, Kan faces hurdles in translating his rising
popularity into legislative achievement, Kingston said. The
opposition  Liberal Democratic Party , which the DPJ ousted from
power last year, opposes many of Kan’s proposals.  
 “The chances of the LDP cooperating with him are very
Low,” Kingston said. “His stance will be to portray the LDP as
blocking legislation from helping the economy.”
