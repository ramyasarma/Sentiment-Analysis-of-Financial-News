Standard Chartered Plc  won
dismissal of a Singapore lawsuit by four persons claiming the
bank misled them into buying certain investment products after a
judge ruled there was a risk the trial may not be fair.  Singapore High Court  Judge Tay Yong Kwang  took the
“draconian measure” of throwing out the complaint by Lee Chang
Rung and three of his relatives, according to the  Sept. 17
ruling  made public today. Lee, his brother, sister and brother-
in-law concealed certain documents including not fully
disclosing their previous investments in structured products to
gain an “unfair tactical advantage,” Tay said.  The group claimed they were conservative investors who
placed most of their money with American Express Bank Ltd. in
fixed deposits. Lee and the others claimed that American Express,
which has since been acquired by Standard Chartered,
misrepresented that the investments they bought were safe and
had guaranteed returns.  Lee and the other three complainants are appealing the
decision, Tay said in his ruling.  “There is a serious risk that a fair trial may not be
possible in the light of the hide and seek strategy adopted,”
Tay said, adding there was no indication the claim against the
bank will be pursued “honestly and fairly.”  Leonard Loo appeared for the group and  Hri Kumar  from Drew
& Napier LLC represented Standard Chartered.  The case is Lee Chang Rung v. Standard Chartered Bank
S212/2009 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
