Tianyi Fruit Holdings Ltd. , a
supplier of frozen concentrated orange juice to  Coca-Cola Co.  in
China, said it’s in talks to supply PepsiCo Inc. as the Chinese
company increases production capacity.  The Hong Kong-listed owner of orange plantations is adding
a plant in Chongqing for 130 million yuan ($19 million) to boost
its orange-juice concentrate output 50 percent by the end of
2011, said Ben Wu, chief investment officer at Tianyi.  “In the long run, we can’t just rely on one big
customer,” Wu said in a phone interview in Hong Kong today.
“We would assure supply to Coca-Cola won’t be cut if we are
going to work out deals with Pepsi.”  Coca-Cola and PepsiCo plan to expand in China as rising
wages boost consumption in the world’s most populous nation.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest maker of soft
drinks, said last year it would invest $2 billion over three
years in China, and Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo said in May
it would invest $2.5 billion by 2013.  Tianyi’s  profit more than doubled from a year earlier to
156.6 million yuan in the year ended June 30, the company said
yesterday in a filing to Hong Kong stock exchange. The shares
fell 1.7 percent to HK$2.97 as of the midday trading break in
the city.  Hong Kong-based newspaper The Standard reported the news
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
