Hong Kong plans to introduce a
paperless securities market starting in 2013, the city’s stock
exchange and regulators said today in a  statement .  Initially, investors will be able to hold securities either
in physical certificates, or in a paperless form that will allow
for more efficient transactions, the statement said.  A working group from the Securities and Futures Commission,
 Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.  and the Federation of Share
Registrars Ltd., was formed in 2009 to develop the so-called
scripless regime. Scrip is a document that a company issues to
indicate ownership of stock. The group expects the first phase
of the system to be implemented in late 2013, the statement said.  Going scripless “will be a significant step forward in
enhancing the overall efficiency and competitiveness of Hong
Kong’s securities market,” said the SFC’s Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Wheatley .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
