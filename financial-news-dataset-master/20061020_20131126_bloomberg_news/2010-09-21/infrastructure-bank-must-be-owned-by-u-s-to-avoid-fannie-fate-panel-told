President  Barack Obama ’s proposed
bank to lure private cash for highway and water projects should
be funded solely by the U.S. to avoid flaws that led to a
takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a  UBS AG  executive said.  UBS Americas Chief Executive Officer  Robert Wolf  told the
Senate Banking Committee today in prepared testimony that the
“time has come” for a U.S. infrastructure bank, which Obama
proposed this month in a $50 billion plan to rebuild roads,
railways and airport runways.  “Funding its equity in this manner will avoid the problems
seen with the government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, which are hybrid organizations chartered to
be owned by private shareholders while benefiting from
government sponsorship,” Wolf said in testimony for a hearing
on the proposal. “The national infrastructure bank should be
fully owned by the federal government with no private
shareholders.”  Obama, during his 2008 campaign for president, proposed a
$60 billion bank focused on transportation projects of national
significance. Congress hasn’t acted on the idea.  The U.S. seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest
sources of mortgage money, in September 2008 amid investment
losses that pushed the firms to the brink of collapse. The two
companies in 2008 started buying mortgages with credit scores
that suggested the loans were more likely to default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
