Jefferies Group Inc. , the New York-
based securities firm that added 20 percent more staff in one
year, hired  Michael J. Sharp  as general counsel.  Sharp, 55, a former  Citigroup Inc.  lawyer who is leaving
the law firm of WilmerHale, was also named executive vice
president and secretary. He replaces  Lloyd H. Feller , who will
retire at the end of the year, Jefferies said today in a
statement. Feller, 68, had been general counsel for eight years.  Jefferies has increased its staff in a drive to pick up
capacity from failed investment banks including Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. and profit from a recovery
in the financial-services industry.  Sharp “brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to
Jefferies at this critical time of ongoing growth and change for
our firm and our industry,” Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Rich Handler , 49, said in the statement.  Sharp had been a partner at WilmerHale since March 2009 and
focused on litigation and enforcement issues for Wall Street
clients. Before that he spent 12 years at Citigroup, where he
was general counsel for global wealth management, consumer
banking and global cards, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
