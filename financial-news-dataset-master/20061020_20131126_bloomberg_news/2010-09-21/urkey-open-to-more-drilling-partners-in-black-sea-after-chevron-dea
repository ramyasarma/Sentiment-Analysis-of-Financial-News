Turkey is open to new partnerships
for oil and gas exploration in the Black Sea, the head of the
state-run oil company said after announcing a $750 million deal
with Chevron Corp.  “New partnerships for oil and gas exploration in the Black
Sea outside those now existing are possible,” said Mehmet Uysal,
head of Turkiye Petrolleri AO. “In three years we plan $4
billion in investments, large and small, to open close to 500
wells,” Uysal said.  Turkey has also signed agreements with Exxon Mobil, the
largest oil company in the United States, and Brazil’s state-
owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, for Black Sea
drilling and exploration. Chevron is the second-largest oil
company in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
