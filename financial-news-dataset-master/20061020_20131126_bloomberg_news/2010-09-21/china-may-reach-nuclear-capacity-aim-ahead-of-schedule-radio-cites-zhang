             China may achieve its long-term
plan of having 40,000 megawatts of nuclear power capacity four
to five years ahead of schedule, China National Radio said,
citing  Zhang Guobao , head of the National Energy Administration.  
 The State Council, or Cabinet, has approved a plan to build
34 reactors with a capacity of 36,920 megawatts, the state-run
radio station  said , without giving a schedule. Twenty-five units
with a capacity totaling 27,730 megawatts are already under
construction, according to the report.  
 China must guard against overcapacity in nuclear power, the
state-run radio station said, citing Zhang.
