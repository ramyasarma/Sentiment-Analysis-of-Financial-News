Aluminum Corporation of China , the
nation’s biggest producer, formed a mining resources unit to
acquire raw material assets locally and overseas, the Ministry
of Land and Resources said.  The unit will seek reserves of minerals including aluminum,
copper, iron, coal, gold, zinc and lead, the ministry said today
on its  website , without giving more details. The unit’s initial
capital of 300 million yuan ($45 million) will increase to 1
billion yuan in two years, it said.  Chinalco, as the Beijing-based company is known, aims to
enter new businesses and cut its dependency on smelting revenues
as China faces an aluminum overcapacity. Its listed unit
 Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.  agreed on July 29 to pay $1.35
billion for a stake in Rio Tinto Group’s Simandou iron ore
project in Guinea, making its first investment in the commodity.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , or Chalco, gained 0.4 percent
to HK$6.83 at the close of trading in Hong Kong. The benchmark
Hang Seng Index climbed 0.1 percent.  Chalco, which also has Chinalco’s aluminum assets, posted a
loss of more than 500 million yuan ($74 million) in June alone
after China increased power rates. Chalco needs three years to
achieve its strategic shift into the various businesses from
only aluminum, Chairman  Xiong Weiping  said Aug. 24.  -- Helen Yuan . Editors:  Indranil Ghosh ,  Sam Nagarajan   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
