Oil traded little changed near $75
a barrel in New York after falling as an industry report showed
an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles and analysts estimated the
nation’s refineries operated at their lowest rate in five months.  Futures declined yesterday after the American Petroleum
Institute said inventories increased 2.23 million barrels to
364.1 million. This is the highest  level  for this time of year
in the past five years. Refineries probably ran at 86.8 percent
of capacity last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
analysts before an Energy Department report today.  “The economy is not moving as fast as it should and as a
result of that, we have more supply in the crude market than
what we would expect,”  Jonathan Barratt , managing director at
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, said by telephone
today. “There is too much oil.”  The November contract was at $75.10 a barrel, up 13 cents,
in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
12:18 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday it lost $1.22, or 1.6
percent, to $74.97. Futures are down 5.4 percent this year.  Crude for October delivery slipped $1.34, or 1.8 percent,
to $73.52 a barrel yesterday, the lowest closing price since Aug.
31. The contract expired at the end of floor trading.  Oil also fell yesterday as Labor Department figures
released in Washington showed payrolls dropped in 36 U.S. states
in August, indicating the market will take time to rebound from
the recession.  Crude Inventories  Supplies  of crude at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point
for New York futures fell by 219,000 barrels to 34.8 million,
the API data showed. Inventories in the U.S. Midwest and the
Gulf Coast, home to a majority of the country’s refining
capacity fell.  The premium between the November New York oil future and
December contract narrowed to $1.59 a barrel today. It was as
wide as $1.75 on Sept. 17.  Oil stockpiles climbed the most, by 1.9 million, in the
Western U.S., a market area considered removed from rest of the
country because of an inability to shift crude and fuels.  The Energy Department report will probably show that U.S.
oil supplies shrank 1.75 million barrels from 357.4 million last
week, according to the Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline
stockpiles probably fell 250,000 barrels from 224.5 million, the
survey showed.  U.S. gasoline  demand rebounded  from a 23-month low last
week, MasterCard Inc. reported yesterday. Motorists bought an
average 9.01 million barrels a day of the motor fuel, up 1.9
percent from the prior week, according to the weekly
SpendingPulse report. It was the first increase in five weeks.  Most U.S. stocks declined, pulling the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index down from a four-month high, as investors bought
Treasuries amid speculation the Federal Reserve will purchase
more government debt to buoy the economy. The S&P 500 lost 0.3
percent to 1,139.78 in New York.  Brent crude for November settlement fell as much as 42
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $78 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, and was at $78.30. Yesterday, it
slipped 90 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $78.42.  November Brent’s premium to the New York contract was at
$3.20 a barrel today after reaching $3.45 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
