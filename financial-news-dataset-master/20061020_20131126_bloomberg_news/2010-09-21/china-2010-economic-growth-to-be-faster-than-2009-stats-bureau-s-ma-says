             China’s economy will grow faster
this year than a year ago with better quality and economic
structure, Ma Jiantang, head of the National Bureau of
Statistics, said in a speech published on the bureau’s website
today.  
 Ma said the global economic recovery won’t be proceeding
smoothly because of weak consumer spending and the lack of
growth momentum in the developed economies and volatilities in
major currencies and commodity prices.  
 China’s economy is moving towards an “expected” direction
of the macro-economic controls, and the reason for the slowdown
this year is due to policy measures and a higher comparison than
a year earlier, Ma said in a speech dated on Sept. 18.  
 China’s economy grew at 9.1 percent in 2009.
