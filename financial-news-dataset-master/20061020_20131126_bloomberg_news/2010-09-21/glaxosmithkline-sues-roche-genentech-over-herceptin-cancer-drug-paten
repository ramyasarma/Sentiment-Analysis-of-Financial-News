A U.S. unit of  GlaxoSmithKline Plc ,
the U.K.’s largest drugmaker, sued rival  Roche Holding AG  and
its Genentech Inc. unit over a patent used in the cancer drug
Herceptin.  GlaxoSmithKline LLC alleged that Roche and Genentech, in
manufacturing their cancer therapy, were infringing “antibody
purification” elements for which the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office issued patents in 2008 and last month, according to the
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  “GSK has been damaged by defendants’ infringement,” the
London-based company alleged in its complaint. The company seeks
compensatory damages for any infringement up to the date a
judgment is entered.  Basel, Switzerland-based Roche, the world’s biggest maker
of cancer treatments, last year acquired the 44 percent of South
San Francisco, California-based Genentech that it didn’t already
own. The companies derived almost $5.2 billion from U.S. sales
of Herceptin last year, according to Bloomberg data.  Genentech filed a reciprocal action at the U.S. court in
San Francisco yesterday, seeking a judge’s finding that it had
not infringed the same two patents.  Caroline Pecquet , a spokeswoman for Genentech, acknowledged
the lawsuits in an e-mailed statement and declined further
comment.  There was no immediate reply to a voice-mail message
seeking comment from Glaxo’s media relations department in
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  The Wilmington case is GlaxoSmithKline LLC v. Roche Holding
Ltd., 10cv799, U.S. District Court for Delaware (Wilmington).
The opposite case is Genentech Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC,
10cv4255, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
