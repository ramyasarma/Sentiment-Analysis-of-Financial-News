The rand gained for a third day
against the dollar before a Federal Reserve meeting where policy
makers are expected to keep interest rates at a record low,
maintaining the yield differential between U.S. and rand assets.  South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 0.6 percent
to 7.0819 per dollar and traded 0.1 percent stronger at 7.1153
by 4:17 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.1270.
Against the euro, the rand lost 0.3 percent to 9.3428.  The Federal Open Market Committee will probably affirm its
pledge to keep interest rates low for an “extended period” and
maintain a $2.05 trillion floor on its holdings of securities,
according to a Bloomberg survey. The FOMC is scheduled to
release its policy statement at about 2:15 p.m. in Washington, a
day after the National Bureau of Economic Research announced
that the longest and deepest U.S. recession since the Great
Depression ended in June 2009, after lasting 18 months.  “An unchanged monetary stance from the Fed today, if
accompanied by an upbeat or bullish tone,” is likely to boost
investors’ appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets,
 Standard Bank Group Ltd.  analysts led by  Michael Keenan  in
Johannesburg, wrote in a client note. “While any sign that the
Fed may need to inject further stimulus into the economy is
expected to weigh on the dollar, it could also be negative for
the rand if investors seek out safe-haven assets.”  Bonds  The rand has rallied 32 percent versus the dollar since the
start of last year as near-zero interest rates in developed
nations encouraged investors to borrow cheaply and invest in
higher-return markets. With a benchmark rate of  6 percent 
compared with 0.1 percent in Japan, 0.25 percent in the U.S. and
0.5 percent in the U.K., South Africa has attracted investments
in its assets worth 100.8 billion rand ($14.2 billion) so far
this year, according to stock and bond exchange data.  The rand’s gains prompted Trade Minister Rob Davies to say
today that the currency’s strength poses a “huge challenge”
for the economy, as government tries to boost exports to reduce
unemployment. The International Monetary Fund also called the
rand “overvalued” even as the Washington-based lender raised
the country’s growth forecast for 2010 to 3.2 percent, from a
previous estimate of 2.6 percent, according to a country report
posted on its website.  Government bonds rose in South Africa for a second day,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
climbing almost 8 cents to 125.30 rand. The yield on the bond
decreased less than 3 basis points to 7.33 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
