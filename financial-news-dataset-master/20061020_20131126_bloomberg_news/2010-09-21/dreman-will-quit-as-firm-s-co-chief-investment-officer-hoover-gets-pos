David Dreman , the fund manager best
known for against-the-grain bets on stocks he deems cheap, will
step down as co-chief investment officer of Dreman Value
Management LLC.  E. Clifton Hoover , who joined the firm in 2006 as co-chief
investment officer, co-director of research and managing
director, will succeed Dreman, 74, the company said today in a
statement. Dreman, who founded the Jersey City, New Jersey-based
firm in 1977, will stay on as chairman and as a member of the
investment committee.  “This succession plan has been several years in
development,” Dreman said in the statement.  Hoover will take over on Oct. 31 as sole investment chief,
with responsibility for $5 billion in assets. He joined the firm
four years ago from NFJ Investment Group LP in Dallas, where he
oversaw large and small-company stocks.  “David has created a solid value foundation and over time
has been looking for someone to keep this firm on a value
stance,” Hoover said today in an interview.  Dreman will continue to manage the $77.5 million  Dreman
High Opportunity Fund  and the $7.26 million  Dreman Market Over-
Reaction Fund . The High Opportunity Fund rose 30 percent in
2009, beating 81 percent of its peers, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The fund slumped 45 percent during the financial
crisis of 2008, as bets on financial-company stocks backfired.  High Opportunity Fund  The Dreman High Opportunity Fund advanced 1.3 percent this
year through yesterday, lagging behind 73 percent of similarly
managed rivals, according to Bloomberg data.  The next five to 10 years will be a “good stock-picker’s
market,” Hoover said. The firm was a buyer of BP Plc’s American
depositary receipts as they fell to the “low to mid $30s”
after the April explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, and bought
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 2009 when the stock fell below $100,
Hoover said. Shares of London-based BP traded at $38.38 at 1:24
p.m. in New York, while Goldman Sachs was at $152.47.  Dreman is the author of several books on investing,
including “Contrarian Investment Strategies: The New
Generation” (Simon & Schuster, 1998).  To contact the reporter on this story:
