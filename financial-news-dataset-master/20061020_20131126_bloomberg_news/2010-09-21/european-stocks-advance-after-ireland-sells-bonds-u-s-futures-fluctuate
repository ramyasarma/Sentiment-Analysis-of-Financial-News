European stocks advanced, extending
yesterday’s 1.3 percent rally for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
after Ireland sold 1.5 billion euros of bonds at an auction.  The Stoxx 600 gained 0.3 percent to 266.9 at 10:17 a.m. in
London. Ireland sold 2014 notes at a bid-to-cover ratio of 5.1
times, compared with 5.4 times at the previous sale, a day after
the yield spread between German bunds and Portuguese and Irish
debt widened to a record.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1
percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index also gained 0.1
percent.
