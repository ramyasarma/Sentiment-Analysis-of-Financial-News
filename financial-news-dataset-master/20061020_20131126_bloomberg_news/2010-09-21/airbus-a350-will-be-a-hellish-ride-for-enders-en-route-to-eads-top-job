Tom Enders  slipped on his tan
leather aviator jacket and shades and settled in the pilot seat
of a white helicopter, before commanding the chopper through the
skies of northern Germany on its 20-minute flight to Hamburg.  “It’s going to be a hellish ride,” the German Airbus
chief executive officer had told a crowd at a jet component
factory on Aug. 31 before taking off. Luckily for his three
passengers, Enders wasn’t talking about his skills as a pilot.  Rather, the source of his concern is the new A350 wide-body
jet being created under increasing time pressure at factories
across Europe. Enders has reason to navigate with caution, as he
tries to avoid the delays that dogged the world’s largest
aircraft maker and rival  Boeing Co.  on recent programs. Boeing
is almost three years behind on its 787 Dreamliner built from
composites that inspired Airbus to respond with the A350.  Shepherding the A350 to its first delivery in 2013 would
hand Enders his best chance yet to blunt Boeing’s dominance in
wide-body jets, a segment that makes up 40 percent of the $70
billion commercial aircraft market. The A350 would cement his
standing with Airbus parent  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.  at a time when CEO  Louis Gallois  prepares to retire by 2012.  “It’s the make-or-break project for Enders,” said  Horst Niehus , co-chairman of Airbus Europe’s employee council and
council works chairman at Hamburg, the center of German
operations. “If he pulls it off, then nobody can stop him.”  Troubleshooter  Much of Enders’s leadership since he took over Airbus in
2007 has been an exercise in troubleshooting. Both the A380
superjumbo, years behind schedule and billions of euros over
budget, and the delayed A400M military transport were
brainchildren of Frenchman  Noel Forgeard , who ran Airbus from
1998 to 2005 before becoming EADS co-CEO along with Enders.  EADS fired Forgeard in 2007 following the delays on the
A380, and Enders moved down one rank to take over Airbus, while
the EADS top job went to Frenchman Gallois, now 66. Enders, 51,
joined EADS in 2000 when the company was created, and led the
defense unit until he took charge of the entire company with
Forgeard five years later.  Enders tackled the A380 delays by integrating French and
German engineering teams and giving them identical design
software, allowing Airbus to turn over at least 20 A380s this
year, twice the figure from 2009. On the A400M, he brought
management of the military transport from Spain under his
control in Toulouse, and coaxed the seven government customers
into an agreement to share the burden of cost overruns.  ‘Learning Lessons’  “This is about learning lessons from our mistakes in the
past, from the competitors,” said Enders. “But lessons learned
are only one side of the coin. The other side is anticipating
new problems, and that relates to the new technological
challenges.”  Boeing forced Airbus’s hand on the A350. When the U.S.
maker unveiled plans for its 787 with a structure largely made
of composites, Airbus tried to counter by hanging new engines on
its existing A330. Airlines balked, and it took Airbus two years
until carriers backed its concept of the all-new A350.  The 787 and A350 have much in common. Both manufacturers
use carbon-fiber composites for more than 50 percent of the
structure, a departure from traditional reliance on aluminum.
Composites, made from petroleum-based products filled with epoxy
resin and then cooked, are four times stronger than aluminum,
and considerably lighter, making them attractive to jet makers.  Different Approaches  The two aircraft makers opted for different approaches
constructing their jets’ fuselage, which are traditionally built
in panel sections over a skeleton. Boeing departed from that
method by building large barrel sections with no internal
structure. Airbus kept the traditional concept on the A350,
arguing the structure is more flexible to adapt.  Airbus may have some other advantages. While Boeing’s last
all-new plane, the 777 wide-body, was designed in the early
1990s, Airbus’s most recent model, the A380, was designed
earlier this decade. That will allow Airbus to use and improve
upon many of the systems and innovations used in that plane,
said  Yan Derocles , an analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris.  Airbus has taken the move from metal to carbon-fiber more
gradually than Boeing. The A380 was 25 percent made from
composites, up from 15 percent on the A340-600 jet. Boeing
jumped from 15 percent on its 777 to more than 50 percent on the
787, giving it a steeper learning curve.  Sharing Risk  To limit its own investment on the 10-billion-euro ($13
billion) model, Airbus has given risk-sharing partners 53
percent of the A350 work, while keeping processes such as wing
design and building largely in-house. Boeing, by contrast, moved
70 percent of 787 work to suppliers, including the wing to
Japan, a move that contributed to some of the delays on the jet
when parts delivered by partners didn’t meet specifications.  “Airbus has probably learned a lot from what Boeing has
done with the 787,” said  Gary Chapman , president of Emirates
Group Services and Data, whose airline unit has 70 A350s on
order. “These new programs are fraught with challenges.”  Airbus has secured 535 orders from 33 customers for the
A350, compared with 847 for the 787. The largest variant of the
A350, the A350-1000, will challenge Boeing’s popular 777, and
the U.S. aircraft maker is considering improvements to protect
its market. The A350 will seat about 260 to 350 passengers,
depending on the configuration, compared with as many as 290 on
the 787, slated for service in early 2011.  ‘Heat is On’  Enders maintains that the A350 program is largely on track
for first delivery to Qatar Airways Ltd. in mid 2013, even after
a three-month delay in the design process that forced Airbus to
shorten a flight test schedule to nine months from 12.  Airbus completed the design phase in July and started
production last month. Among challenges it needs to tackle is
the plane’s weight, according to Enders. Airbus is studying the
designs on a so-called mock-up of a fuselage section that
includes seats, electrical systems and pilot sleeping
compartments, to complement the digital master plan.  “The A350 needs to be more or less on time, because if
it’s not, every time a new plane or a new engine is announced,
investors are going to run a country mile,” said  Sandy Morris ,
an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, who advises investors
buy EADS shares. “The heat is on for management to get this
right.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
