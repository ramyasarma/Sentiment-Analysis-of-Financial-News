World steel production rose 4.2
percent last month from a year earlier, returning to levels
recorded before the global recession, the World Steel
Association said.  Output advanced to 112.9 million metric tons, compared with
108.4 million tons a year earlier and 113 million tons in 2008,
the Brussels-based group said in a  report  today. Production rose
15 percent in the European Union and gained 25 percent in North
America. Chinese output fell 1.1 percent to 51.6 million tons.  “World crude steel production in August 2010 was almost at
the same level as August 2008, before the impact of the global
economic crisis was felt,” the WSA said in the report.  ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, said this
month it would raise European prices by 5 percent as of next
month to pass on higher raw-material costs. Baoshan Iron & Steel
Co., China’s biggest publicly traded steelmaker, on Sept. 14
said it was increasing October prices for its benchmark products
for the first time in five months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
