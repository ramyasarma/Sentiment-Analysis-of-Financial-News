             Taiwan’s dollar strengthened the
most in seven weeks after the government reported a bigger
pickup in August export orders than economists forecast.  
 The currency rose 0.4 percent to NT$31.619 versus the
greenback, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Export orders, indicative of shipments in one to three
months, increased 23.3 percent from a year earlier in August
following an 18.2 percent gain the previous month, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs said yesterday in Taipei. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 20.7
percent increase.
