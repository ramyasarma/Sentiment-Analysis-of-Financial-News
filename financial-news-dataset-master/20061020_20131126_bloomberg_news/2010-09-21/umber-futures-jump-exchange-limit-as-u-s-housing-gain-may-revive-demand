Lumber futures rose the maximum
permitted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as a jump in U.S.
housing starts revived prospects for construction materials.  Builders in August broke ground on 598,000 homes at an
annual rate, up 10.5 percent from July and the most since April,
the Commerce Department said. Economists forecast a 550,000
pace. Building permits, an indicator of future activity, rose
from a record low. Lumber futures are up 27 percent since
touching an eight-month low in June.  “Housing starts, that’s it,” said  Jamie Greenough , a
broker at Global Securities Corp. in Vancouver.  Lumber futures for November delivery rose the CME’s $10
daily limit, or 4.5 percent, to $232 per 1,000 board feet as of
9:12 a.m. in Chicago. That’s the highest price for a most-active
contract since Sept. 14.  Futures soared to a four-year high of $337 on April 21 on
speculation that the U.S. economic recovery would fuel demand
for wood products. Prices slid to $183 by June 23.  “The housing market has found a bottom, and we’re bouncing
along here,” said  Thomas Simons , an economist at Jefferies
Group Inc. in New York.  Construction  of single-family homes rose
4.3 percent, after a 6.7 percent decline in the month prior.  The  Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilding Index ,
which tracks shares of 12 companies including Toll Brothers
Inc., today jumped as much as 1.8 percent to 245.83, the highest
level since July 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
