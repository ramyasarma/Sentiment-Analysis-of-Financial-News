Canada’s foreign affairs department
has warned against crossing the Mexico-U.S. border by land
because of the risk of violence linked to drug trafficking in
the area.  “Shootouts, attacks, and illegal roadblocks may occur at
any time,” the notice posted yesterday on the department’s Web
site said. Travel should be limited to essential trips after
“appropriate arrangements” are made to ensure security, the
notice said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
