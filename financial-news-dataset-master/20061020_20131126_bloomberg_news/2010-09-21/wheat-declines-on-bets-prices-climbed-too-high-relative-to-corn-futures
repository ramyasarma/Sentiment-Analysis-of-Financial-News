Wheat fell for the fifth time in
six sessions on bets that demand will decline because the price
is too high relative to corn, another source of livestock feed.  Wheat’s premium to corn is $2.13 a bushel, above the one-
year average of $1.52 a bushel. Demand for wheat probably will
slow because the grain is too expensive as an alternative source
of livestock feed, said  Jon Marcus , the president of Lakefront
Futures & Options in Chicago.  “This is all about the spread between corn and wheat,”
Marcus said. “That spread is out of hand.”  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 13.75 cents, or
1.9 percent, to close at $7.18 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price has surged 33 percent this
year as adverse weather slashed global production.  The price may fall as low as $6.50 because of slack demand
for lower-quality U.S. wheat and improving conditions in Russia,
Marcus said. Russia halted exports in mid-August following the
most-severe drought in five decades.  Conditions for completing Russia’s grain harvest and
growing winter crops will be “satisfactory” in most parts of
the country, the national weather center said today. This year’s
grain harvest fell 32 percent to 54.3 million metric tons, as of
today, Interfax said.  Last year, the U.S. was the world’s biggest wheat exporter,
following by Canada, Russia and Australia.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
