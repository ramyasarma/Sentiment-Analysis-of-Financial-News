India’s  10-year bonds  fell, pushing
their yield to their highest level in two weeks, on speculation
a sale of government debt this week is cooling demand for
existing securities.  The government will sell 110 billion rupees ($2.4 billion)
of bonds maturing in 2017, 2020 and 2040 on Sept. 24, the
 central bank  said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Overnight
 call money  rates at which banks lend to each other rose to a
six-month high of 6.20 percent, after corporate tax payments
drained cash from banks.  “The demand for bonds may remain subdued until liquidity
improves,” said  Mukesh Kumar , a fixed-income trader at State
Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai. “The debt supplies are
putting further pressure on bonds.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 rose two
basis points to 7.99 percent as of 9:50 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.08, or 8 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 98.76.  The amount  borrowed  by banks from the Reserve Bank of
India’s repurchase auction window averaged 356 billion rupees
each day in the past week compared with 11 billion rupees in the
previous seven days, indicating tight cash conditions.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
was unchanged. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, was at 6.39 percent.
