Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
creditors led by hedge fund Paulson & Co. said the bankrupt
firm’s plan to infuse another $1 billion into its two banks
requires more work before it is completed.  The creditor group said in a court filing yesterday that
before Lehman puts in the money it wants to know more about
possible liabilities the banks face from their past involvement
in mortgage securitization. The group also questioned Lehman’s
plan to divide the cost of the rescue with affiliates, saying
“the shifting of hundreds of millions of dollars of assets and
liabilities between debtors” was decided by “one conflicted
individual and counsel,” whom it didn’t name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
