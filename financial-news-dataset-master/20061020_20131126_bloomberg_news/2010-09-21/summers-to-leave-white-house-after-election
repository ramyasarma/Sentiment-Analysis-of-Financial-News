The White House said  Lawrence Summers , director of the National Economic Council, will leave
the administration and return to Harvard University at the end
of the year.  Summers, chief adviser to President Barack Obama on the
development and implementation of economic policy, previously
served as Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration.  “I will always be grateful that at a time of great peril
for our country a man of Larry’s brilliance, experience and
judgment was willing to answer the call and lead our economic
team,” Obama said in a statement issued by the White House.
“Over the past two years, he has helped guide us from the
depths of the worst recession since the 1930s.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
