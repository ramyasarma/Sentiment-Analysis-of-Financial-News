Treasuries gained, pushing  yields 
on two-year notes to a record low, on speculation the Federal
Open Market Committee may indicate today that it’s open to
increasing purchases of U.S. debt if economic growth slows.  Benchmark 10-year notes advanced for a third day in the
longest winning streak since July. The  extra yield  investors
demand to hold the notes compared with 2-year securities dropped
to the lowest level in a week as policy makers met.  “The market has had a relentless bid heading into the FOMC
announcement,” said  Christian Cooper , senior rates trader in
New York at Jefferies Group Inc., one of the  18 primary dealers
that trade with the Federal Reserve. “Some investors are
looking for the Fed to extend quantitative easing. The market
might be setting itself up for disappointment.”  The yield on the 10-year note decreased 4 basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.67 percent at 12:24 p.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in August 2020 rose 11/32, or $3.44
per $1,000 face amount, to 99 21/32.  The two-year note  yield  fell 1 basis point to 0.46 percent
after touching the all-time low of 0.4479 percent. The 10-year
note yield dropped to a 19-month low of 2.42 percent on Aug. 25.
The last time the 10-year note yield slid for three days in a
row was on July 30.  The  difference  between 10- and 2-year note yields fell to
2.22 percentage points, the narrowest since Sept. 14, reflecting
concern the U.S. economic recovery is stalling.  Bernanke’s View  The central bank “is prepared to provide additional
monetary accommodation through unconventional measures if it
proves necessary, especially if the outlook were to deteriorate
significantly,” Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Aug. 27 at a
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  A survey of money managers overseeing $1.34 trillion by
Jersey, City, New Jersey-based Ried Thunberg ICAP, a unit of the
world’s largest interdealer broker, found that 57 percent don’t
expect the Fed to announce additional asset purchases, while 43
percent expect policy makers to say they’re resuming
quantitative easing.  The central bank will hold off from expanding its balance
sheet by purchasing securities, according to 60 of 64 analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey from Sept. 16 to 17.  Ten-year notes rose on Aug. 10, when the Fed said after its
policy meeting that it would keep its bond holdings level by
resuming the purchase of U.S. debt to support a recovery it
described as “more modest” than earlier anticipated.  The Fed has bought $28.102 billion of Treasuries since Aug.
17 to keep holdings in the System Open Market Account at about
$2 trillion by using the proceeds of principal payments from its
agency mortgage-backed securities and agency debt.  Slowing Growth  Economic growth slowed to a 1.6 percent annual pace in the
second quarter, from 3.7 percent from January through March, the
Commerce Department said Aug. 27.  Private payrolls rose last month by 67,000, more than
economists forecast, after a revised gain of 107,000 in July,
the Labor Department reported Sept. 3. The unemployment rate
increased to 9.6 percent from 9.5 percent.  “There is little momentum in the economy at this point,”
 Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. rates strategy for fixed income
and currencies at the primary dealer Royal Bank of Canada in New
York, wrote in a note to clients. “But unless Bernanke gave us
a half-baked view in Jackson Hole, it’s not about the
unemployment rate or growth in general. It’s about inflation.
Specifically, if deflation risks rise meaningfully, that would
set another round of QE in motion.”  Inflation Rate  Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased in
August for a fifth month at an annual rate of 0.9 percent,
matching the slowest year-over-year rate of gains since 1966,
the Labor Department reported Sept. 17.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the maturity known as the
break-even rate, has climbed to 1.79 percentage points from this
year’s low of 1.47 percentage points reached in August. It’s
still less than the five-year average of 2.11 percentage points.  BNP Paribas SA and Deutsche Bank AG, both primary dealers,
predict 10-year note yields will fall to what would be a record
2 percent by Dec. 31. An investor who buys today would earn 6.7
percent if the forecasts are correct, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The yield touched the record low of 2.0352 percent
in December 2008.  “A change in the wording of the Fed statement, such as
revising down growth, will prepare the ground for more concrete
action,” said  Cyril Beuzit , head of interest-rate strategy at
BNP in London. “That would support the market. We favor the
scenario for lower yields.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
