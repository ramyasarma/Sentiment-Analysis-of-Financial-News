French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
government will offer amendments to his pension-overhaul plan as
it heads to the  Senate ,  Le Parisien  reported, citing an
interview with Labor Minister  Eric Woerth .  While the government will stick to lifting the retirement
age to 62 from 60 and the age at which full benefits can be
obtained to 67 from 65, Woerth said amendments will aim to raise
payouts for women, help seniors who lose their jobs and aid
handicapped workers, the daily said.  The National Assembly, the lower house, approved the plan
on Sept. 15. Unions will hold strikes and protests against the
measure Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
