Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-
owned oil company, said its operations at the Salina Cruz 
refinery weren’t affected by a 5.1-magnitude earthquake off 
the coast of Oaxaca, Mexico. Even though the earthquake was 
felt at the plant, operations continue to run at “normal” 
levels, Federico Gonzalez, a spokesman for the refinery, said 
in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
