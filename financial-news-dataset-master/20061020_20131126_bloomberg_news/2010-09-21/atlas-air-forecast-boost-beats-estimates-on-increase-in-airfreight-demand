Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. 
operator of the world’s largest fleet of Boeing Co. 747
freighters, climbed the most in four months in Nasdaq trading
after boosting its 2010 profit forecast amid rising demand.  Adjusted earnings for the year will exceed $5.30 a share,
up from a previous projection of $4.35, the Purchase, New York-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts had  predicted 
$4.61, the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Carriers have grounded half of the 747-200 freighters
worldwide and are using more space on jetliners for luggage
rather than cargo as air travel rebounds, said  Helane Becker , a
Dahlman Rose & Co. analyst in New York who recommends  buying 
Atlas Air.  Delta Air Lines Inc.  retired the last 10 of its 747-
200 freighters from Northwest Airlines last year.  “Eighty percent of all freight moves in passenger
aircraft,” Becker said in a telephone interview. “There’s
definitely a lack in capacity.”  Atlas Air rose $3.69, or 7.5 percent, to $53.18 at 4:15
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the most
since May 10. The shares have  climbed  43 percent this year.  Airfreight demand will rise to a  record  in 2010, bolstered
by technology shipments, Chief Executive Officer  William J. Flynn  said in the statement.  Strength in Atlas Air’s civilian business will offset an
“anticipated moderation” in military shipments in this year’s
second half, Flynn said. In August, the company said demand for
military flying would ease in the rest of the year because the
Pentagon had completed the buildup in Afghanistan and was
shrinking the U.S. mission in Iraq.  The earnings forecast excludes a net expense of about 33
cents a share related to costs for legal settlements and gains
from disposing of aircraft assets, Atlas Air said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
