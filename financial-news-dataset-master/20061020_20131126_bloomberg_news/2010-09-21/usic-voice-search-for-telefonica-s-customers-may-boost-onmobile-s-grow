Onmobile Global Ltd., an Indian
supplier of ringtones for mobile-phone service providers,
expects its partnership with Europe’s second-biggest phone
company to help accelerate sales growth in the next two years.  Onmobile, based in Bangalore, is investing $75 million to
provide services including a radio application to Telefonica
SA’s clients in Latin America, said Chief Financial Officer
Rajesh Moorti.  “Bulk of the cash flow will be this year,” Moorti said
in a phone interview from Mumbai. “The first full year where
you will see the impact on the revenue will be on the fiscal
year beginning April 2011.”  Sales growth at Onmobile may accelerate after rising at
its slowest pace since at least 2005 as the company taps into
growth in Brazil, the world’s fasting growing major economy
after China, and other Latin American nations. Onmobile is
offering radio, voice search and text message services to
Telefonica’s 143 million customers in the region.  Onmobile’s shares, which have declined 10 percent this
year, dropped 2.2 percent to 352 rupees at 11:18 a.m. in Mumbai.  Revenue may grow by 29 percent to 6.9 billion rupees ($151
million) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, because of
steady domestic revenue and “upsides from the Telefonica
deal,” according to Bhavesh Gandhi at India Infoline Ltd., who
rates the stock a “buy.”  The company’s sales rose 11.8 percent to 4.5 billion
rupees in the year ended March 31.  Onmobile has 33 percent market share in India’s value-
added service market, Gandhi said in a report dated Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
