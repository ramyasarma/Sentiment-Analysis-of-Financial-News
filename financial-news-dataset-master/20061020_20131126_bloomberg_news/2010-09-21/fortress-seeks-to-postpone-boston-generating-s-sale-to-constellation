Constellation Energy Group Inc. ’s
plan to buy Boston Generating LLC’s assets for $1.1 billion
should be delayed for more review,  Fortress Investment Group LLC 
said.  Fortress, one of Boston Generating’s creditors, filed an
emergency motion in New York bankruptcy court today that seeks
to postpone a Sept. 27 court hearing at which Boston Generating
will ask a judge to approve an auction of its assets.  Fortress and CarVal Investors LLC, which is also a lender,
said in court papers that Boston Generating, a unit of US Power
Generating Co., is moving at a “breakneck pace” to sell its
assets while refusing to provide information that would allow
them to review the proposal.  Boston Generating filed for bankruptcy in August with an
agreement to sell five power plants in the Boston area to
Baltimore-based Constellation for $1.1 billion. The deal would
be subject to higher bids at the auction that Boston Generating
has proposed.  Lawrence McDonnell , a spokesman for Constellation, and D.J.
Baker, a lawyer for Boston Generating, couldn’t be reached for
comment.  The case is In re: Boston Generating LLC, 10-14419, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
