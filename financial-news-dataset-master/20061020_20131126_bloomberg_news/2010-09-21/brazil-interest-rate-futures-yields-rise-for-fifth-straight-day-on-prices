Brazil’s real gained the most in
two weeks after the Federal Reserve said it’s willing to ease
monetary policy further to spur growth, widening the yield
advantage of the South American economy’s fixed-income assets.  The real gained 1.1 percent to 1.7141 per dollar at 3:16
p.m. New York time, from 1.7331 yesterday. It was the biggest
intraday advance since Sept. 2.  Yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries fell to a record low of
0.4155 percent as the Fed said it’s ready to “provide
additional accommodation if needed” to support the economic
recovery. That compared with 11.54 percent on Brazilian
government bonds with similar maturity.  Brazil’s 17.9 billion reais ($10.4 billion) sovereign
wealth fund hasn’t purchased dollars yet, after the government
yesterday authorized it to buy an unlimited amount of dollars
for reais, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said today.  The central bank bought $5.9 billion in the first 12
business days of September,  Altamir Lopes , head of the bank’s
economic department, told reporters today. The purchases are the
biggest for the period since October 2009, when policy makers
bought $6.3 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
