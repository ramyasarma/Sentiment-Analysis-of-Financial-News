Soybeans gained for a third
straight session as U.S. exporters increased sales to China, the
world’s biggest consumer and buyer.  U.S. shippers sold 170,000 metric tons to China for
delivery before Aug. 31, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today. Yesterday, the agency reported sales of 225,000 tons. The
 dollar  has dropped this month against a basket of major
currencies, increasing the appeal of U.S. crops.  “China keeps buying U.S. soybeans,” said  Jerry Gidel , a
market analyst for North American Risk Management Services Inc.
in Chicago. “The dollar is weaker, and that will help to keep
U.S. soybeans competitive.”  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 2 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $10.865 a bushel at 11:14 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Yesterday, the oilseed reached $10.995, the
highest level for a most-active contract since June 2009. Before
today, the price climbed 20 percent this quarter.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
