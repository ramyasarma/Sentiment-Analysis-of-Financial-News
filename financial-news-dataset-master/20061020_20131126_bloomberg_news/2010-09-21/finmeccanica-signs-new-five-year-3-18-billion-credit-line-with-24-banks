Finmeccanica SpA , Italy’s biggest
defense company, signed a new five-year 2.4 billion-euro ($3.18
billion) revolving credit line with 24 banks led by BNP Paribas,
according to a statement distributed by the Italian exchange.  The company will pay a spread of 75 basis points more than
Euribor, the statement said. The credit line will serve as a
liquidity back-up and replace most of Finmeccanica’s existing
bank credit lines, according to the statement. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The transaction received 3.8 billion euros of demand,
Finmeccanica said in the statement.  “The high level of oversubscription confirms the
confidence that banks have towards Finmeccanica,” Chief
Executive Officer  Pier Francesco Guarguaglini  said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
