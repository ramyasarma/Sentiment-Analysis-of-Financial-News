Joaquin Almunia, the European
Union’s antitrust commissioner,  said  a possible merger of
Bayerische Landesbank and  WestLB AG  “may not automatically
result in restoration of their long-term viability.”  “The Commission would need to assess whether the merged
entity would be viable in the long-term and whether the measures
to ensure burden sharing and to limit competition distortions
are adequate,” he said in an e-mailed statement today.  As part of its restructuring, WestLB has to sell itself by
the end of 2011 under conditions imposed by the EU Commission.
The lender has received several bailouts, including 3 billion
euros ($3.9 billion) in capital from Germany’s Soffin bank-
rescue fund. It set up a separate bad bank to rid itself of
about a third of its assets, including toxic securities.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
