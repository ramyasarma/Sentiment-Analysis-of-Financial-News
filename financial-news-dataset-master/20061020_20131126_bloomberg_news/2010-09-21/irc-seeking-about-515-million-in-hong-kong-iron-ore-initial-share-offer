             IRC Ltd., the iron-ore unit of
Russia’s third-biggest gold producer, is seeking about HK$4
billion ($515 million) in an initial public offering in Hong
Kong, according to terms for the sale.  
 Shares of IRC, a unit of  Petropavlovsk Plc , are being
offered at HK$2.20 to HK$3 apiece, the terms show. The sale of
1.325 billion shares is made up of 80.8 percent new stock and
19.2 percent existing equity. The company plans to fix the price
on Oct. 6 and start trading on Oct. 14, the terms say.  
 Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch, Bank of China
International Holdings Ltd. and UBS AG are joint bookrunners for
the sale, according to the terms. The three banks, Liberum
Capital Ltd. and Troika Dialog are joint managers.  
 Petropavlovsk joins commodity producers including  United Co.
Rusal , the world’s largest aluminum maker, in seeking funds in
Hong Kong as Chinese raw-material demand jumps. London-based
Petropavlovsk acquired the iron ore assets that are located near
the border with China through its 294.5 million-pound ($459
million) purchase of Aricom Plc in 2009.
