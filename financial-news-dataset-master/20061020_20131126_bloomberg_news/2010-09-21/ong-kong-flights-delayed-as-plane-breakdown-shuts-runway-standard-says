More than 80 flights were delayed
in Hong Kong yesterday evening after a fully-loaded cargo plane
broke down on one of the airport’s two runways, the Standard
said, citing the Airport Authority and carriers.  The runway was closed between 6 p.m. until at least
midnight, affecting at least 8,000 passengers in the first three
hours, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper reported
today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
