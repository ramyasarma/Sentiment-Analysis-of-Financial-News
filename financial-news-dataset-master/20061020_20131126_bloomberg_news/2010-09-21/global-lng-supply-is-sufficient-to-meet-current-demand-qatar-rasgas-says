Global supply of liquefied natural
gas is sufficient to meet current demand, said the head of
marketing at Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co.  Rasgas has boosted capacity to 37 million metric tons even
as Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG producer, seeks to increase
total capacity to 77 million by December, said Khalid Sultan al-
Kuwari at the World LNG Series conference in Singapore today. He
declined to comment on Rasgas’s output forecast this year or on
why Qatar had shut production lines in the second quarter.  Demand for the cleaner-burning fuel has increased this year
because of higher industrial production, said Dan Werner,
general manager of LNG at BG Group Plc, at the conference. LNG
consumption in Asia has increased by 11 million tons, or 20
percent, in the first half of 2010 from a year earlier, led by
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, he said.  “Longer-term LNG demand in the region and worldwide is
robust,” Werner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
