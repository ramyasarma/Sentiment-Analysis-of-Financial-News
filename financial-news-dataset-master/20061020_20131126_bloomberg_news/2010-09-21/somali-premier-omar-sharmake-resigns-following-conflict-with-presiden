Somalian President  Sharif Sheikh Ahmed  appointed  Mohamed Abdullahi  as prime minister less than a
month after the resignation of Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmake
after disagreements with other members of the government.  “His appointment came after long discussions and
consultation with many concerned parties,” President Sharif
Sheik Ahmed told reporters in the capital, Mogadishu, today.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ousting of former dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.
Most of southern and central Somalia is under the control of
rebel Islamist fighters, while the United Nations-backed
government holds only portions of Mogadishu.  Abdullahi will give priority to security issues, he said at
the press conference with the president.  Abdullahi was born in Mogadishu in 1962 and has worked as a
Somali diplomat in Washington DC and later held jobs in the U.S.
including municipal posts in the Buffalo District. He also
taught at the Erie Community College.  To contact the reporter on this story:
