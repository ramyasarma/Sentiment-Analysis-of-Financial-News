             Taiwan’s dollar rose the most in
seven weeks after the government reported export orders for
August that were better economists’ forecasts.  
 The currency has climbed 1.5 percent this month as funds
based abroad bought $2 billion more Taiwanese shares than they
sold through yesterday.  Overseas orders  climbed 23.3 percent
from a year earlier, compared with an advance of 18.2 percent in
July, the government said toward the close of local trading
yesterday. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for an increase of 20.7 percent.  
 “The Taiwan dollar has been rising in the past few months
because of very strong fundamentals and rising exports,” said
 Tarsicio Tong , a currency trader at Union Bank of Taiwan in
Taipei. “We’ll continue to see foreigners pouring money into
Taiwan and Asian stock markets.”  
 The Taiwan dollar rose 0.4 percent to NT$31.624 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 9:28 a.m. in Taipei, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. The currency strengthened as much as 0.5
percent, the most since Aug. 2.  
 The island’s dollar retreated in the final minutes of
trading yesterday on speculation the central bank intervened to
check appreciation that may hurt exports, according to two
traders familiar with the matter who declined to be identified.
The Taiwan dollar has pared gains or weakened in the final
minutes of trading on most days in the past five months due to
intervention, according to the traders.  
 Yields Drop  
 Tong predicts the currency will climb further before
economic data due later this week. The government will say on
Sept. 23 that industrial production advanced 22 percent from a
year earlier in August after having increased 21 percent in July
and the jobless rate fell to the lowest level in 20 months,
according to separate Bloomberg surveys.  
 The Taiwanese economy, which contracted 1.9 percent in
2009, will expand 8.24 percent in 2010, the statistics bureau
forecast on Aug. 19.  
 Government bonds rose for the first time in three days. The
yield on the 1.125 percent note maturing in September 2020
dropped two basis points to 1.25 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.
