             Germany plans to introduce tougher
privacy laws in December after talks with Google Inc. and other
internet companies, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere.  
 Internet companies have been asked to submit their
suggestions for self-regulation between now and a planned
meeting in December; Germany planned a law that would reflect
its citizens’ privacy concerns and the Internet companies’ need
to provide services, the newspaper cited him as saying.
