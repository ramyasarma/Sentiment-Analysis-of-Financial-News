K+S AG , Europe’s biggest potash
producer, forecast a moderate gain in 2011 sales, disappointing
some analysts who labelled the guidance conservative given a
background of rising demand and prices for the crop nutrient.  Sales volumes of potash and magnesium products will just
exceed 7 million tons next year, up from the expected 6.7
million tons to 6.9 million tons in 2010, Kassel-based K+S said
in a statement. The company reported third-quarter net income of
76.8 million euros, up from 3.7 million euros.  K+S said demand for potash and salt topped management
 targets  in the third quarter. Farmers are replenishing nutrients
in the soil as grain prices rise and after reducing applications
of potash over the past two years. The company on Nov. 2 raised
its 2010 earnings  target  to as much as 670 million euros ($923
million) after pushing three price increases to European
customers this year.  “No surprise, but sobering 2011 guidance,” said Wolfgang
Fickus, an analyst at WestLB.  K+S shares fell 2.3 percent to 50.88 euros in Frankfurt
trading as of 8:35 a.m. local time. Fickus, in a note, deemed
the outlook “overly conservative,” yet he advised clients to
buy K+S shares following any declines.  Salt Bonus  Earnings also got a lift after K+S became the world’s No. 1
salt producer with the purchase of Morton Salt from  Dow  Chemical
Co. a year ago. K+S also expects to sell 21 million tons of
salt, down on 2010 levels. The company booked a cost of 39.6
million euros from Morton Salt in the first nine months to
reflect depreciation of valuations.  “For 2011 too, we are confident that we will be able to
significantly raise both operating earnings and adjusted group
earnings after taxes,” Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Steiner 
said in the statement today.  Potash is a water-soluble form of potassium. More than 93
percent of its world-wide production, predominantly in Russia,
Belarus and Canada, is used to make fertilizer.  The industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation and
attempted takeovers by metals miners seeking to diversify, led
by BHP Billiton Ltd.’s failed attempt to buy Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. for $39 billion. Vale SA bought about $3.8
billion of fertilizer assets from Bunge Ltd. earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
