Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. , or CME, fell to a 15-month low in Czech trading after MSCI
Inc. said it will remove the broadcaster from the  MSCI Czech
Republic Index , reducing the stock’s appeal for some investors.  CME  fell  4.5 percent to 395.3 koruna in Prague, its lowest
closing price since July 31, 2009, after earlier falling as much
as 8.5 percent. More than 580,000 shares changed hands, or
almost five times the daily average in the past three months.  The Bermuda-based operator of television channels in
central and east Europe will be dropped from the MSCI gauge
after the market closes on Nov. 30, the compiler of benchmark
indexes said in a statement dated yesterday.  Changes to indexes can alter share prices as passively
managed funds buy and sell stocks to mirror benchmark indexes.
CME gained 19 percent on May 26, the day before it was added to
the MSCI Czech Index, as the inclusion boosted demand for the
stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
