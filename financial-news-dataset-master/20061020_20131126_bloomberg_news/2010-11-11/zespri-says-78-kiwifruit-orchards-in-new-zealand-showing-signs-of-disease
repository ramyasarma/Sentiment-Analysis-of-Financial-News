Zespri, New Zealand’s biggest
kiwifruit exporter, said 78 orchards have reported symptoms of a
bacterial vine disease that has been confirmed at three sites.  Testing of the orchards is under way, with priority being
given to the type of symptom and their location, Chief Executive
Officer Lain Jager said on a conference call. Many growers are
being precautionary and their orchards may be clear, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
