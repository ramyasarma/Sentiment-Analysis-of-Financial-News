It is becoming “increasingly
challenging” to share the view that Ireland can return to bond
markets in the first half of next year, after “panic” seized
markets yesterday, Glas Securities, the Dublin-based fixed-
income firm said in a note today.  LCH Clearnet Ltd. yesterday demanded its clients place a
larger deposit when trading Irish government bonds after the
yield on the nation’s debt soared. The move, which takes effect
today, has led to “fresh concerns,” Glas said.  The Irish government needs to present a “credible” four-
year austerity plan and get its budget for 2011 approved, if
Irish bond spreads are to normalize in “any way,” Glas said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
