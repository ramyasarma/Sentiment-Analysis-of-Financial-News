Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, dropped in London
trading because of investor concern about 42.2 billion pounds
($68 billion) of loans to Ireland, according to MFGlobal
Securities Ltd. analyst  Shailesh Raikundlia .  The  stock  lost 2.7 percent to 41.02 pence at the close in
London, the lowest in four months. The bank was the sixth-worst
performer in the 54-member Bloomberg  500 Banks Index .  “It’s to do with their exposure to Ireland,” said
Raikundlia. “They have significant exposure.”  Irish bond yields have soared on concern that the
government will need assistance bailing out its banks, which are
struggling with bad loans after the end of a decade-long real
estate boom. Irish Central Bank Governor  Patrick Honohan 
yesterday said that loan losses at the country’s lenders,
including foreign-owned banks, come to at least 85 billion euros
($117 billion).  RBS’s Ulster Bank unit had 37.8 billion pounds of  loans in
Ireland , including 21.4 billion pounds of mortgages at the end
of the third quarter, the bank said last week. It also had 4.3
billion pounds invested in Irish sovereign debt, according to
stress tests in July. A spokesman for RBS declined to comment on
the price movement.  RBS last week said loan losses in Ireland “increased
sharply, reflecting a deterioration in the economic
environment.” Ulster Bank posted loan losses of 286 million
pounds in the three months ending Sept. 30, double those in the
year-earlier period. It also doubled its pretax operating loss
to 176 million pounds.  RBS, based in Edinburgh, was bailed out in 2008 and 2009
with 45.5 billion pounds of government assistance to bolster its
capital. Taxpayers own 83 percent of the lender.  To contact the reporters on this story:
