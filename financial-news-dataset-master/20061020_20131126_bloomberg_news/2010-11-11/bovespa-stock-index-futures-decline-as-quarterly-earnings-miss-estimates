The  Bovespa  stock index declined for
a third day, the longest losing streak since August, after
Brazilian companies’ earnings fell short of estimates.  Braskem SA , Latin America’s largest petrochemicals
producer, tumbled after net income declined 14 percent.  OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA , the oil company controlled by
Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , tumbled the most in three
weeks after unexpectedly reporting a loss.  Fibria Celulose SA ,
the world’s largest pulp producer, fell after third-quarter
profit dropped more than analysts had forecast.  The  Bovespa  fell 0.6 percent to 71,195.16 at the 3 p.m. New
York time close. Forty-six stocks dropped on the measure while
20 gained. The real weakened 0.5 percent to 1.7157 per dollar.  “Some of the earnings were bad,” said  Felipe Casotti , who
helps manage 968 million reais ($563.7 million) at Maxima Asset
Management in Rio de Janeiro. “It generates some caution. We’re
coming from a period of gains, so there’s room for profit taking
if people get pessimistic.”  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge fell yesterday as real-
estate companies tumbled on concern borrowing costs will rise
more than previously estimated, overshadowing a rally in phone
companies and steelmakers. The  Bovespa  is up 22 percent from a
May 20 low.  Braskem  Braskem posted third-quarter net income of 554 million
reais, down from 645 million reais a year earlier, according to
a regulatory filing.  OGX Petroleo reported a third-quarter loss of 199.5 million
reais, compared with a loss of 60.6 million reais during the
period a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing.
Analysts expected a profit of 12.6 million reais, according to
the average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Fibria said third-quarter net income fell 18 percent to 303
million reais. Profit excluding some items was expected to be
541.7 million reais, the average of three analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Braskem fell 1.4 percent to 17.70 reais. OGX slid 3.1
percent, the most since Oct. 19, to 20.85 reais. Fibria fell 2
percent to 30.28 reais, for the biggest drop since Oct. 22.  The  Bovespa  trades for 11 times analysts’ 2011 earnings
estimates, compared with a ratio of 11.6 for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index and 15.4 for Mexico’s IPC, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 15.1 times the
reported profits of its companies, down from 25.5 times a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
