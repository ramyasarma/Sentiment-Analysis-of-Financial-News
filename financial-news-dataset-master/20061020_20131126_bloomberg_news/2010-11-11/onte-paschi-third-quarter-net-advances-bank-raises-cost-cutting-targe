Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ,
Italy’s third-biggest bank, said quarterly profit increased 38
percent after setting aside less money to cover bad loans and
raising its target for cost cutting.  Net income rose to 95.8 million euros ($132 million) in the
third quarter, from 69.3 million euros a year earlier, the
Siena-based lender said today in a statement. That compares with
the 102 million-euro  average estimate  of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Paschi expects to cut costs by 4.5 percent this year,
higher than its previous forecast of 3.5 percent.  “We have almost completed our cost restructuring,”
General Manager  Antonio Vigni  said today during a conference
call. The bank expects higher net interest income and fees in
the fourth quarter, he said.  Monte Paschi, which showed the weakest results among
Italian banks in European stress tests, is cutting costs and
selling assets, including 1.5 billion euros of commercial
mortgage-backed securities, to strengthen its capital. Chief
Financial Officer  Marco Massacesi  said in August that the bank
won’t need to raise capital and will be able to repay government
aid through property sales and higher earnings.  Capital Ratios  Monte Paschi’s Tier 1 ratio increased to 8.4 percent by
Sept. 30 from 7.8 percent at the end of June, according to the
statement. The estimated impact on the bank’s ratio from the
proposed Basel III rules is 70 basis points by 2013, while core
Tier 1, excluding government aid, should rise to about 7 percent
by the end of 2012, Massacesi said on the conference call.  “Low solvency remains Monte Paschi Achilles’ heel,”
 Andrea Vercellone , an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG with an
“outperform” recommendation on the stock, wrote in an Oct. 29
note. “Although in our view management will tap the market for
additional capital at some stage, we see no rush to raise
capital.”  Net trading doubled to 16.3 million euros, while net
interest income rose 1 percent to 907 million euros. Provisions
for bad debt declined to 281.5 million euros in the period from
351 million euros a year earlier.  Monte Paschi fell 0.6 percent to 91.4 cents at 10:45 a.m.
in Milan trading, giving the company a market value of about 6.1
billion euros. The stock is  down  26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
