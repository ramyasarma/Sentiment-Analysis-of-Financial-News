Most U.K. stocks declined, as losses
by ICAP Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc offset gains by
Xstrata Plc and Antofagasta Plc.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index was little changed, slipping
0.1 percent to 5,811.82 at 11:35 a.m. in London, after swinging
between gains and losses at least seven times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
