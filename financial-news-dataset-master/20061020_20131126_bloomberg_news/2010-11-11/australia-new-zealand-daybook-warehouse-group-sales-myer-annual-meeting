An overview of activity since
markets closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks slid, with benchmark indexes
falling for a third time this week, after Cisco Systems Inc.
projected sales and profit that fell short of analysts’
estimates and concern over Europe’s debt crisis intensified.
*Cisco, the sixth-largest U.S. technology company by market
value, plunged as much as 17 percent, the most in 16 years on a
closing basis. Hewlett-Packard Co. and Microsoft Corp. slipped
at least 1.3 percent as technology stocks declined the most
among 10 groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
*The S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 1,209.62 at 12:30 p.m. in
New York.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 102.51 points, or 0.9
percent, to 11,254.53.  London: Most European stocks fell on concern that some of the
region’s most indebted nations will be forced to restructure
their finances and as technology shares dropped after Cisco
Systems Inc.’s forecasts missed estimates.
*Bank of Ireland Plc paced a decline in banks, falling 7.9
percent. Alcatel-Lucent SA sank 2.8 percent, leading technology
shares lower. Allianz SE, Europe’s biggest insurer, retreated as
regulators were said to be considering tighter rules for the
industry.
*The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed at 271.39 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London, as three stocks fell for each one
that advanced. The gauge tumbled 15 percent from April 15 to May
25 amid concern that efforts by indebted European governments to
reduce their deficits may derail the economic recovery. The
measure has since rallied 17 percent.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks gained for a second day, led by banks
after an upgrade by Deutsche Bank AG, while a stronger dollar
boosted the outlook for export earnings.
*Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest publicly
traded bank, climbed 1.5 percent on the upgrade prompted by
speculation some banks will be exempt from stricter capital
requirements. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s No. 1 carmaker,
jumped 2 percent.
*Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 80 percent of its
revenue from overseas, advanced 0.6 percent. Inpex Corp., the
nation’s largest oil and gas explorer, rose 0.9 percent after
oil prices advanced.
*The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.3 percent to 9,861.46 at
the close in Tokyo.
*The broader Topix index climbed 0.4 percent to 856.37, with
about three shares gaining for every two that fell.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose
0.6 percent to 4,728.60 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney.
*New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.1 percent to 3,331.50 at
the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The euro slid to the lowest level in more than a month
versus the dollar as concern that some European countries will
have difficulty paying their debt and a drop in stocks curbed
investors’ appetite for risk.
*The shared currency fell versus 14 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as France backed German calls for investors to
share the cost of restructuring sovereign debt. The Dollar Index
advanced for a fifth day, matching a stretch of gains in August.
*The 16-nation currency dropped 0.9 percent to $1.3657 at 1:43
p.m. in New York, from $1.3783 yesterday. It touched $1.3638,
its weakest level since Oct. 5. Europe’s common currency
declined 0.6 percent to 112.73 yen, from 113.41 yesterday.
*The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 82.55 yen, from 82.28.  COMMODITIES  METALS  New York: Copper rose to a 30-month high in New York and touched
a record in London as reports showed higher factory output and
stronger inflation in China, the world’s biggest consumer of the
metal.
*Copper futures for December delivery added 6.5 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.034 a pound at 10:44 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, prices touched $4.0835, the highest level since
May 5, 2008, when the most-active contract reached a record
$4.2605.  GOLD  New York: Gold gained in New York as European debt concerns
spurred demand for a protection of wealth and as faster
inflation in China boosted demand for commodities.
*Gold futures for December delivery added $8.70, or 0.6 percent,
to $1,408 an ounce at 8 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The metal
for immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent higher at
$1,408.15. It reached a record $1,424.60 on Nov. 9.  OIL  New York: Oil fluctuated as U.S. equities retreated after Cisco
Systems Inc. said profit will miss analyst estimates and a
report showed Chinese refiners processed a record amount of
crude.
*Oil retreated as Cisco’s forecast triggered a selloff in
technology companies. Futures surged earlier when a report
showed that Chinese refineries processed 12 percent more crude
in October than a year earlier, according to China Mainland
Marketing Research Co.
*Crude oil for December delivery declined 4 cents to $87.77 a
barrel at 1:32 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
touched $88.63, the highest level since Oct. 9, 2008.  WHAT TO WATCH
