Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, said it signed accords worth
$3.46 billion to construct the frame for eight offshore
platforms to help it develop pre-salt crude discoveries.  The platforms will be used in the first stage of oil
production in the Santos Basin, Petrobras said in a regulatory
filing today. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras’s development
partners, the U.K.’s  BG Group Plc , Portugal’s  Galp Energia SGPS
SA  and Spain’s  Repsol YPF SA , also signed the contracts with
Engevix Engenharia SA, it said.  The platforms built by Barueri, Brazil-based Engevix “will
be of great strategic importance for the company to achieve its
production targets,” Petrobras said in the filing.  Petrobras may invest $400 billion through 2020 to develop
the biggest crude discoveries in the Americas in three decades,
trade and development Minister Miguel Jorge said yesterday. The
Tupi and Libra fields may hold as much as 8 billion barrels and
15 billion barrels, respectively.  Each platform will have the capacity to process 150,000
barrels per day of oil and 6 million cubic meters of natural gas
a day, Petrobras said. The platforms will be operating by 2017.  Six platforms will be used in the BM-S-11 block owned by a
partnership of Petrobras, BG and Galp. The other two platforms
will be for the BM-S-9 block owned by Petrobras, BG and Repsol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
