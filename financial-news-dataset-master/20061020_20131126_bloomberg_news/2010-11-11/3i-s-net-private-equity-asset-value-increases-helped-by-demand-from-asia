3i Group Plc , Europe’s largest
publicly traded private equity firm, said the value of its
assets climbed 3 percent in the six months through September as
the companies it owned benefited from rising demand from Asia.  3i’s diluted net asset value climbed to 330 pence a share
at the end of September from 321 pence a share at the end of
March, the London-based firm said in a statement today. The firm
reaped 293 million pounds ($473 million) from selling assets in
the period, and spent 327 million pounds on new investments.  “We can access Asian growth in our U.S. and European
portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer  Michael Queen  told
reporters on a conference call today. “All of our industrial
businesses in Europe have seen good growth on the back of us
helping them to expand their markets in Asia.”  3i, one of the U.K.’s oldest private equity firms, is
seeking to bolster profit after the credit crisis slowed deal
making. Queen, who replaced  Philip Yea  as CEO in January last
year, combined 3i’s leveraged buyout team with its growth
capital unit in September and agreed to buy Mizuho Investment
Management U.K. Ltd. for 18.3 million pounds on Sept. 27 to
expand its investments in corporate debt.  3i  shares  fell 0.9 percent to 321.9 pence as of 8:10 a.m.
in London trading, cutting the company’s market value to 3.12
billion pounds. The stock has climbed 14 percent in London
trading this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
