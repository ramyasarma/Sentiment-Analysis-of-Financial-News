Marussia, a Russian sports car maker
set up by Nikolai Fomenko, an ex-racing driver, is buying a
majority stake in Virgin Racing, a Formula One team backed by
U.K. entrepreneur  Richard Branson , the Financial Times reported,
citing Andrei Cheglakov, a co-investor in Marussia.  LDC, Lloyds Banking Group Plc’s private-equity arm, is
selling the stake; Marussia didn’t disclose its exact size, or
the price it’s paying, the newspaper said.  Russia will host a Formula One grand prix from 2014 to at
least 2020 at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, under an agreement
signed on Oct. 14 by Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  and
 Bernie Ecclestone , Formula One’s commercial director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
