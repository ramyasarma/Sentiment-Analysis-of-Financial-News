Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  denied a
Dow Jones Newswires report that it will stop taking orders early
for General Motors Co.’s  initial public offering , according to
spokeswoman  Andrea Rachman .  “The report that Goldman Sachs is no longer taking orders
or won’t be taking orders, or will stop taking orders on Friday
at noon is incorrect,” Rachman said in a phone interview today.  Dow Jones earlier reported that New York-based Goldman
Sachs would close its  books  on GM’s initial offering tomorrow at
noon, citing Scott Sweet, managing director at research firm
IPOBoutique.com.  GM, 61 percent owned by the U.S. government and based in
Detroit, plans to raise $10.6 billion in an IPO scheduled for
Nov. 17, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
