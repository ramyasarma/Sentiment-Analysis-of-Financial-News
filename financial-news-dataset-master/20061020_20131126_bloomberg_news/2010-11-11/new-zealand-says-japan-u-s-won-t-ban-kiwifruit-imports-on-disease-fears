New Zealand said its trading
partners aren’t planning to stop importing kiwifruit because of
concerns about a spreading bacterial vine disease threatening
the country’s NZ$1.4 billion ($1.1 billion) industry.  Japan, the U.S. and Australia have confirmed they aren’t
“taking any actions” against the import of New Zealand
kiwifruit, Barry O’Neill, director general of the  Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry ’s biosecurity unit, told reporters in a
media briefing today. Biosecurity Minister David Carter earlier
today told the  New Zealand Herald  that New Zealand’s trading
partners could use the outbreak to stop imports.  Australia and the U.S. stopped importing kiwifruit plant
material this week after the disease Pseudomonas syringae pv
actinidiae was found in a North Island orchard. New Zealand is
the third-biggest kiwifruit grower after China and Italy,
accounting for about 21 percent of global production.  “I have been very, very pleased with the responsible
position our markets have taken to the announcement,” O’Neill
said.  There are 78 orchards with suspected symptoms of the
disease, Lain Jager, chief executive officer of  Zespri Group
Ltd ., the world’s largest marketer of the fruit, told reporters
at the same briefing today. A third orchard in the Bay of Plenty
area was confirmed as having the disease yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
