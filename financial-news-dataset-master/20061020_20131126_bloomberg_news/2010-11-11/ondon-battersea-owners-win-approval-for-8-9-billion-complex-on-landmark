The owners of Battersea Power
Station, the derelict London landmark that closed 27 years ago,
won approval to build apartments, stores and offices on the site
at a cost of 5.5 billion pounds ($8.9 billion).  Wandsworth Borough Council  approved the project today after
two other developers failed to revamp the 77-year-old property.
Irish millionaires Richard Barrett and John Ronan, whose Jersey-
registered Real Estate Opportunities Plc bought the site in
2006, plan to construct 3,700 homes and 2.3 million square feet
(214,000 square meters) of commercial properties.  Barrett and Ronan need the building permits to raise money
from investors to finance the project and repay money owed to
Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency. They plan to transfer the 38-acre (15-hectare) site to a
separate company and have held talks with potential investors
including sovereign wealth funds and large real estate
companies, according to Rob Tincknell, a director of REO.  The former electricity plant, Europe’s largest brick
building, has four 350 foot-high smokestacks and appears on the
cover of Pink Floyd’s “Animals” album. Previous proposals for
the site included a theme park and a shopping mall that would
have been suspended between the chimneys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
