Oil traded near its highest price in
two years in New York after U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly
declined and investors bet that demand is increasing in China,
the world’s biggest energy user.  Crude gained for a second day after the Energy Department
said stockpiles fell 3.27 million barrels last week to 364.9
million. Supplies were  forecast  to increase 1.5 million barrels,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. Chinese
refiners processed 12 percent more crude in October than a year
earlier, according to China Mainland Marketing Research Co.  “The market perception is that unbridled Chinese demand
will continue to support oil,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior
broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. in London. “But there are
still question marks about whether fundamentals elsewhere can
durably keep prices this elevated.”  Oil for December delivery rose as much as 82 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $88.63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
That’s the highest price since Oct. 9, 2008. The contract was at
$88.06 at 1:14 p.m. London time. Brent crude for December
settlement traded at $89.03 a barrel, up 7 cents, after rising
as high as $89.70 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  China’s state oil companies are boosting processing in a
bid to ease diesel shortages in the country’s south caused by
factories and farmers using more fuel. China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, increased
production to a record in October, parent China Petrochemical
Corp. said on Nov. 4.  U.S. Supplies  New York futures are up about 1.4 percent this week and
have advanced every day this month except for Nov. 9. Oil has
rallied more than 10 percent in 2010 as shrinking fuel
stockpiles in the U.S., the largest crude consumer, signaled a
recovery in demand.  Distillate fuel inventories, including heating oil and
diesel, fell 4.97 million barrels to 159.9 million, the seventh
weekly drop, according to yesterday’s Energy Department report.
That’s the biggest volume decrease since February 2007. Supplies
were forecast to decline 2 million barrels, based on the
Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.92 million barrels to 210.3
million, the lowest level since November 2009, the report
showed. A 1 million-barrel drawdown was projected.  Refineries operated at an average of 82.4 percent of
capacity, up 0.6 percentage point from the previous week, the
department said. Crude imports fell 5.7 percent to 8.09 million
barrels a day, the  lowest rate  since January.  OPEC Forecast  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised
its 2011 forecast for global oil demand as industrial
consumption recovers in developed countries including the U.S.
and Germany.  OPEC expects daily oil demand to grow by 1.2 million
barrels to 86.95 million barrels next year, according to the
producer’s monthly report today. That’s 120,000 barrels a day
more than last month’s forecast.  Oil supplies at  Cushing , Oklahoma, the delivery point for
New York futures, declined 1.75 million barrels to 31.8 million,
the biggest volume drop since September 2009. Stockpiles are at
the lowest level since the week ended April 2.  The longest period of contango in the U.S. oil market may
end as storage capacity at Cushing expands by more than a
quarter. New York crude traded at $1.73 a barrel less than the
six-month contract, compared with $9.88 in May. This contango,
in which prompt oil is cheaper than for later delivery, has
averaged $2.70 in the past five years.  Oil may rise further because prices have yet to reach a
Fibonacci retracement target used by technical traders,
according to  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity derivative sales manager
at Newedge Group in Tokyo. Futures are below $89.84 a barrel,
the halfway point between the all-time high of $147.27 traded in
July 2008 and a low of $32.40 in December that year.  “Until the crude market goes up to the 50 percent rebound
line, it’s still possible to go to the upper side,” Hasegawa
said. “Brent is very near to $90 a barrel. That is a target
technically.”  -- With assistance from  Rachel Graham  in London. Editors:  John Buckley ,  Jonas Bergman   To contact the reporters on this story:
