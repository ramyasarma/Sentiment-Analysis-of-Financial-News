Japanese  stocks  gained for a second
day, led by banks after an upgrade by Deutsche Bank AG, while a
stronger dollar boosted the outlook for export earnings.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s biggest
publicly traded bank, climbed 1.5 percent on the upgrade
prompted by speculation some banks will be exempt from stricter
capital requirements. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s No. 1
carmaker, jumped 2 percent.  Canon Inc. , a camera maker that gets
about 80 percent of its revenue from overseas, advanced 0.6
percent. Inpex Corp., the nation’s largest oil and gas explorer,
rose 0.9 percent after oil prices advanced.  “Bank shares are rebounding, after plunging on worries
they would have to raise funds,” said  Koichi Kurose , chief
strategist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., which manages about $57
billion. “Concerns about a double-dip recession in the U.S.
have greatly receded, supporting the dollar’s appreciation.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 0.3 percent to 9,861.46
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index climbed 0.4
percent to 856.37, with about three shares gaining for every two
that fell.  The  Topix  has tumbled 15 percent from its high this year on
April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps to curb property
prices and concern about U.S. economic growth damped confidence
in a global recovery. Stocks in the index trade at 15.2 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 14.4 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Banks Gain  Mitsubishi UFJ advanced 1.5 percent to 399 yen and its
closest rival  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.  rose 1.8
percent to 2,556 yen. Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s
third-largest lender, gained 2.4 percent to 130 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui was the most active stock by value in Japan,
followed by Toyota. Banks were the biggest contributors to gains
by the Topix, followed by carmakers.  Deutsche Bank boosted its investment rating for the banking
industry to “overweight” from “market-weight,” citing
possible exemptions of Japanese banks from stricter
capitalization rules, according to a report dated today.  The Financial Times yesterday reported Group of 20 nations
will consider a plan to treat banks with global operations
separately from those that are primarily domestic. The two-tier
system would exempt most Asian banks from stricter capital
requirements, the report said, citing people familiar with the
agenda for this week’s G-20 summit.  “If it’s true that Japan will be exempted from
systemically important banks, that is a surprise,” Resona
Bank’s Kurose said.  Exporters Gain  Toyota gained 2 percent to 3,115 yen, the biggest
contributor to the Topix’s advance.  Mazda Motor Corp. , Japan’s
second-largest car exporter, jumped 2.4 percent to 218 yen.
 Canon , the world’s biggest camera maker, advanced 0.6 percent to
4,020 yen. Fanuc Ltd., a maker of industrial robots that earns
about 80 percent of revenue overseas, climbed 0.6 percent to
12,390 yen.  The dollar appreciated to as much as 82.80 yen about 3 a.m.
today in Tokyo, the strongest level since Oct. 7, as higher U.S.
Treasury  yields  made dollar-denominated assets more attractive
to international investors. A higher dollar boosts the value of
dollar-denominated sales at Japanese companies when repatriated.  “Business sentiment in the U.S. is gradually improving,
supporting the dollar’s strength,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “It wouldn’t be a surprise even if
the yen weakened to the 84 yen level by December. Many companies
assumed 80 yen per dollar and may raise their earnings
forecasts.”  Inpex rose 0.9 percent to 437,000 yen and Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the nation’s second-largest oil explorer,
climbed 1.3 percent to 2,913 yen.  Crude oil for December delivery increased 1.3 percent
yesterday in New York to $87.81 a barrel, the highest settlement
since Oct. 8, 2008.  To contact the reporter for this story:
