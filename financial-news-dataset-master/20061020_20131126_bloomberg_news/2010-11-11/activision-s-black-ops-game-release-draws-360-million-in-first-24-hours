Activision Blizzard Inc.  said “Call
of Duty: Black Ops,” the latest version of the best-selling
video games, posted $360 million in sales in North America and
the U.K. in 24 hours, a record for any entertainment property.  Demand for “Black Ops” surpassed the previous record of
$310 million in first-day sales set by last year’s “Call of
Duty: Modern Warfare 2,” Santa Monica, California-based
Activision said today in a statement.  Blockbuster video games have eclipsed movies and other
forms of entertainment in sales. “Harry Potter and the Half-
Blood Prince,” released by Warner Bros. in 2009, had the
opening-weekend record for films, with $394 million in worldwide
sales, according to researcher  Box Office Mojo .  Sales of “Black Ops,” from Activision’s Treyarch unit,
are “tracking slightly ahead” of fourth-quarter estimates,
said  Colin Sebastian , an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets in
San Francisco.  Over the holiday period, “Black Ops” may generate more
than $1 billion in retail sales, rivaling top entertainment
debuts such as “Titanic,” “Thriller” and last year’s game,
Sebastian, who recommends clients buy Activision shares, said in
a research note.  Activision fell 13 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $11.69 at
10:44 a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Before
today, the shares had gained 6.4 percent this year.  Video games have a higher retail price, typically $59.99,
compared with $8 to $10 for a movie ticket and $12.99 for the
anniversary edition of  Michael Jackson ’s “Thriller” album on
Amazon.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
