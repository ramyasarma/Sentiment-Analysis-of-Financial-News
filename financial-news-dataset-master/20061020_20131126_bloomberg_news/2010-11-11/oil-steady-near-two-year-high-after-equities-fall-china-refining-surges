Oil declined from a two-year high in
New York on speculation China will raise interest rates, damping
growth in the world’s biggest energy consumer.  Crude fell for the first time in three days and was set for
a weekly drop. Equities slid on signs China is preparing to
increase the cost of borrowing to curb inflation and the dollar
traded near a six-week high against the euro as Group of 20
leaders hold an emergency meeting amid concern that Europe’s
debt crisis is worsening.  “For the time being $90 is going to be a very strong
resistance level; above that, it’s too expensive,” said  Andy Sommer , a senior analyst at EGL AG in Dietikon, Switzerland.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about Chinese monetary policy. If
they tighten further, that has implications for the oil
market.”  Crude for December delivery fell as much as $2.30, or 2.6
percent, to $85.51 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $86.08 at 1:15 p.m. London
time. Yesterday, the contract rose to $88.63, the highest price
since Oct. 9, 2008. Brent crude for December settlement fell as
much as $2.16, or 2.4 percent, to $86.65 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London. The contract expires Nov. 15.
The more actively traded January futures fell $1.59 to $87.51.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  retreated 1.4 percent. The
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index  fell as much as 1.8 percent and Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 1.5 percent. China’s inflation
rate rose to the fastest in two years last month, fueling
speculation an interest-rate increase is imminent.  “People are betting on the Chinese rates and the
discussions in the G-20 meeting are responsible for the current
heavy selloff,” said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at
Astmax Co. in Tokyo.  IEA Demand Outlook  Oil supplies from outside the Organization of  Petroleum 
Exporting Countries will be higher than previously estimated
next year on stronger output from North America and China, the
International Energy Agency said.  Non-OPEC producers will provide 53.4 million barrels a day
in 2011, or 250,000 barrels a day more than the agency’s
estimate a month ago. Worldwide crude consumption will increase
by 1.2 million barrels a day, or 1.4 percent, in 2011 to 88.5
million barrels a day, the IEA said in a report today.  Oil has lost 1 percent this week, paring this year’s gain
to about 8 percent. Prices rallied 78 percent in 2009.  Price Forecasts  Futures may rise next week after an Energy Department
report on Nov. 10 showed U.S. crude and fuel inventories
tumbled, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Sixteen of 37
analysts and traders, or 43 percent, forecast crude will climb
through Nov. 19. Twelve respondents, or 32 percent, predicted
prices will decline and nine estimated there would be little
change. Last week, 59 percent said oil would increase.  OPEC’s compliance with record supply cuts was little
changed last month as production increases in six of its member
countries offset declines in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela,
according to the IEA’s report.  The 11 members bound by quotas produced 26.72 million
barrels a day last month, implying compliance of 55 percent, the
Paris-based IEA said today in its monthly report. That’s down
from a revised 56 percent for September. Supply from all 12 OPEC
nations, including Iraq, fell by 40,000 barrels a day in October
to average 29.15 million barrels daily, it said.  OPEC said in its monthly report yesterday that compliance
with production targets fell last month as countries including
Nigeria and Angola pumped more oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
