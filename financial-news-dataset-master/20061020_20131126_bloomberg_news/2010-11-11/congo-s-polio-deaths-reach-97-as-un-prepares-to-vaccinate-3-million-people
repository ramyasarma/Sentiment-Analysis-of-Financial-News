Three million people will be
targeted for vaccination in response to the Republic of Congo’s
first polio outbreak in a decade, the United Nations Children’s
Fund said.  Immunizations against the crippling viral disease will
begin tomorrow in the Congolese port city of Pointe Noire and
Department of Kouilou, 16 districts in the neighboring province
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Angola, Unicef
said in a  statement  on its Website today.   This is the first vaccination response to the polio
outbreak confirmed on Nov. 4 in the Republic of Congo. As of
Nov. 9, 226 cases of acute flaccid paralysis and 97 deaths have
been reported, New York-based Unicef said. Most of the cases have
involved young adults ages 15 to 29.  “This illustrates that populations are at risk because
they have not been exposed to a full immunisation,” Unicef
said. “The giving of vaccination to all ages is intended to
raise the general level of immunity to stop the spread of the
disease.”  The first case of paralysis was reported to a hospital in
Pointe Noire on Oct. 1.  Most of the cases were reported from
Oct. 11 to Oct. 31, with a peak of 73 cases occuring from Oct.
18 to 24.  “We have to stem this fast-moving outbreak,” said
Unicef’s Regional Director for West and Central Africa
Gianfranco Rotigliano. “We are at a critical juncture and
stopping polio in Africa requires our absolute commitment.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
