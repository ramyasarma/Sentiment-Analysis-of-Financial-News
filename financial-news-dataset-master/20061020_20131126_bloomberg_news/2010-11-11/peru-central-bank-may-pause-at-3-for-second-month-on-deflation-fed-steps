Peru’s central bank may keep its
benchmark lending rate unchanged for a second month as falling
prices allow policy makers to gauge the effect of U.S. stimulus
measures and surging inflows on the country’s currency.  The seven-member board, led by bank President  Julio Velarde , will probably keep the bank’s  reference rate  at 3
percent, according to 13 of 14 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.
One economist expects a quarter-point rise. The board will
announce its decision after 5 p.m. New York time.  Peru  consumer prices  fell for a second month in October,
allowing the bank to extend its pause after five rate increases
since May, said  Alonso Segura , head of research at Banco de
Credito del Peru. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s plan to buy $600
billion of Treasuries in a second round of quantitative easing
has fueled concern that inflows may grow if Peru, the region’s
fastest growing major economy, raises interest rates.  “The bank is a bit more worried about the possible impact
there might be on higher inflows if it continues raising,”
Segura said in a phone interview from Lima. “It’s not clear how
QE will impact the market and short-term capital flows so
they’re going to keep evaluating before hiking.”  Inflows pushed the sol to a two-year high in September as
the currency became more appealing to investors who buy higher-
yielding currencies with funds borrowed in countries with lower-
interest rates.  Inflows  The central bank has increased reserve requirements on
short-term foreign loans and on foreign banks’ deposits in the
country as part of measures to curb speculative inflows.  The bank has also sold new securities and  bought  almost $9
billion in the foreign exchange market to temper gains in the
sol, swelling foreign currency reserves to $43 billion.  Policy makers are ready to implement other measures to
prevent any new surge in inflows from pressuring the sol,  Renzo Rossini , the bank’s general manager, said Oct. 14.  Dollars tied to long-term investment projects and rising
 exports  are also pouring into Peru. Foreign direct investment
rose 23 percent to $3.4 billion in the first half of 2010, from
$2.8 billion a year earlier, according to the United Nations.  Projects concluded this year include Hunt Oil Co.’s $4
billion liquefied natural gas plant, DP World Ltd’s $600 million
container pier in Callao, and Vale SA’s $300 million Bayovar
phosphate mine.  The sol has gained 3.2 percent in 2010, the fourth-best
performance of Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  ‘Tinker at the Edges’  The central bank is trying to stem pressure on the local
currency rather than weaken it, and will likely avoid “heavy-
handed” measures such as taxes on inflows, said  Mike Moran , a
currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank.  “They will tinker at the edges to make sure there’s a
greater balance in terms of inflow and outflow,” said Moran in
a phone interview from New York. “For a lot of the Latin
Americans now, monetary policy is driven by both the local rates
structures as well as the strength of the currencies.”  Under pressure to stem the rise in local currencies,
Brazilian policy makers paused at their last two meetings and
Colombia’s central bank kept its interbank rate at a record low
3 percent at its Oct. 29 meeting.  Chile’s central bank slowed the pace of increases last
month and said the peso’s appreciation was mitigating inflation
and may reduce the need for future rate increases.  Though inflation is contained, Peruvian government outlays
are rising and economic activity remains “vigorous,” Banco de
Credito said in a Nov. 3 report.  Growth Accelerating  Growth in South America’s sixth-biggest economy
 unexpectedly  accelerated in August. September’s rise in gross
domestic product will be close to the 9.2 percent increase in
August, Finance Minister  Ismael Benavides  said Oct. 27. Economic
indicators suggest Peru will have a “strong” fourth quarter as
companies increase spending to meet demand, he said.  “We’re returning to pre-crisis levels of private
investment,” Benavides said Nov. 3. “There are industries that
are getting close to 100 percent capacity, which will demand
further investment.”  Investors now expect Peru’s central bank to pause for at
least the next two months as deflation signals slower growth in
domestic demand,  Manuel Aldave , head of investments at Banco
Internacional del Peru, said in a Nov. 4 interview.  Consumer  prices dropped  0.14 percent last month from
September, the second straight decline. The annual inflation
rate fell to 2.10 percent from 2.37 percent.  The central bank targets annual inflation of 1-to-3
percent.  “Inflation is still within the target range and supply
side pressures have been easing in the last few months,” said
 Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru.  To contact the reporter on this story:
