California ’s October tax receipts
surpassed budget estimates by 4.6 percent, while spending surged
even more, according to Controller  John Chiang .  Last month’s general-fund revenue was $232.3 million more
than anticipated in the recently enacted state budget, Chiang
said yesterday in a monthly  report . October’s spending was $768
million, or 9 percent, more than expected.  Corporate taxes last month produced $26.8 million, or 8.8
percent, more than projected, while personal-income levies
yielded $63.8 million, 1.8 percent, more than estimated,
according to the report.  Revenue  from sales and use taxes
provided $108.7 million, or 13.1 percent, more than budgeted.
The month’s receipts rose 9 percent from a year earlier.  For fiscal 2011, which began July 1, the state collected
$26.1 billion through last month and spent $33.6 billion,
according to the report. Combined with a $9.9 billion deficit on
June 30, California had a $17.5 billion cash gap on Oct. 31
which it covered by borrowing $10.8 billion internally and $6.7
billion from outside sources with revenue-anticipation notes.  The state spent more than budgeted for the fiscal year
through October because it paid some bills more quickly than
anticipated after selling the notes on Oct. 28, according to the
report. That variance will be offset in future months, it said.  “The state received the proceeds from an interim cash-flow
borrowing that allowed us to start paying the $5.5 billion in
payments delayed by the budget for tax refunds, community
colleges and school districts,” Chiang said in a statement.  The nation’s largest state by population enacted its
latest-ever budget on Oct. 8, 100 days into the start of the
fiscal year. The current fiscal year may end with a $6.1 billion
deficit, according to a report released yesterday by the
nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office in Sacramento.  To contact the reporters on this story:
