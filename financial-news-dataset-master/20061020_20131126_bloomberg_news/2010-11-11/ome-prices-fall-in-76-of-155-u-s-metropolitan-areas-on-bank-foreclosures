Home  prices  fell in half of U.S.
cities in the third quarter as banks stepped up repossessions of
properties in default.  The median price of a single-family home dropped in 76 of
155 metropolitan areas measured, the National Association of
Realtors said in a report today. Prices in Ocala, Florida,
slumped 20 percent from a year earlier for the biggest decline.
Palm Bay, Florida, and Tucson, Arizona, followed with a 15 
percent drop. The  median  U.S. price fell 0.2 percent to $177,900.  The U.S. housing market is struggling as lenders seize a
record number of properties and unemployment hovers near a 26-
year high. Banks took over 288,345  homes  in period covered by
the Realtors report, up 22 percent from a year earlier,
according to RealtyTrac Inc., a data firm in Irvine, California.
Foreclosures boost the supply of available homes and reduce
prices because they sell at a discount.  “The bottom has proven to be quite elusive,” said  Stan Humphries , chief economist of data firm Zillow.com in Seattle.
“There could be another 5 percent coming off the national
market” as prices decline further, he said.  The median price of a  single-family  home in the New York
metropolitan area climbed 2.8 percent in the third quarter. The
Edison, New Jersey, region had a 3.5 percent gain and prices in
the Boston metropolitan area rose 5.3 percent, the report said.  The best-performing markets included Burlington, Vermont,
with a price increase of 18 percent; Elmira, New York, up 17
percent; and Dallas-Fort Worth, which gained 14 percent.  In a separate report today, the Realtors group said U.S.
sales tumbled 25 percent to a 4.16 million seasonally adjusted
annual pace in the third quarter from the previous three months.
The pace was 21 percent below the 5.28 million rate of the year-
earlier period.  The U.S.  homeownership rate  remained at a 10-year low of
66.9 percent in the third quarter, the U.S. Census Bureau said
in a Nov. 2 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
