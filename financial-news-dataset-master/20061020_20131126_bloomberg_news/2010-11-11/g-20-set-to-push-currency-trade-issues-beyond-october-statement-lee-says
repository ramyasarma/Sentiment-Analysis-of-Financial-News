The leaders of the Group of 20
economies are likely to advance on issues including currency and
current-account policy beyond the communique published after the
meeting of G-20 finance chiefs in October, G-20 committee
spokesman Kim Yoon Kyung said in Seoul today.  “The prospect is now positive. The G-20 leaders will
likely move forward beyond the Gyeongju commitment over currency
and current-account issues,” he said, referring to the South
Korean city where the G-20 finance chiefs met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
