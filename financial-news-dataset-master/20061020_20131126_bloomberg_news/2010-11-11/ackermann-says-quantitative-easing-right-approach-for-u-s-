Deutsche Bank AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  said the Federal Reserve’s plan to buy
more Treasury securities is the “right approach” for the U.S.,
which has limited tools to stimulate its economy.  “The instruments which are available are limited and
quantitative easing is one of them,” Ackermann said today in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in Seoul, where he is
attending a meeting of corporate executives. “I think it’s the
right approach given the complexity of the economic situation
and the fragility in the economic situation in the U.S.”  Ackermann’s stance contrasts with the majority of
respondents in a Bloomberg Global Poll of 1,030 investors,
analysts and traders, who said the Fed’s latest quantitative
easing is unlikely to boost jobs or the economy. Officials from
China, Germany and Brazil have said the Treasury-purchase plan
may jar other economies while failing to fuel U.S. growth.  Ackermann, 62, said separately that Deutsche Bank is
seeking “organic” growth of its business in Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
