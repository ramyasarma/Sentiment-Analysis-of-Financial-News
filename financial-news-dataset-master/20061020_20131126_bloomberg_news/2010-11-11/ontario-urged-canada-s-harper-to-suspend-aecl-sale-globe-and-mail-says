Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty
warned the Canadian government in June that its plan to sell
Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.’s Candu nuclear-reactor unit to
investors might bring to naught a planned reactor purchase by
the province, the Globe & Mail reported.  In a letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a copy of
which has been obtained by the newspaper, McGuinty said the
government should concentrate on selling Candu reactors to
Ontario and suspend the bidding process.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
