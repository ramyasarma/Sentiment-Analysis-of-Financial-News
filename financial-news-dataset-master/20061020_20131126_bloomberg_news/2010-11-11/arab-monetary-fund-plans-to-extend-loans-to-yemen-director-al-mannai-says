The  Arab Monetary Fund , a subsidiary
of the 22-member Arab League, plans to provide Yemen with a loan
in an effort to counter political and security instability with
economic progress.  “Yemen will receive priority” funding, Jassim Al-Mannai,
director general of the Arab Monetary Fund said in an interview
yesterday in Abu Dhabi. A reformed economy and attractive
investment climate is the best way “to improve the situation of
the citizens and the population,” he said.  Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East, has asked
for $44.5 billion in aid over the next five years from Western
and Persian Gulf donors to jumpstart its economy and combat the
spread of terrorism. The Arabian Sea nation, which is the
ancestral home of al-Qaeda leader  Osama bin Laden , is emerging
as a base for the radical group as its members come under
pressure in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Yemen was the source of two unexploded bombs that were
intercepted on Oct. 29 in the United Arab Emirates and the U.K.  The Arab Monetary Fund was created in 1976 with the
objective of correcting the balance of payments of its members,
improving Arab monetary cooperation and encouraging development
of the region’s financial markets.  An Arab Monetary Fund delegation is currently assessing
data from a visit to Yemen this week and will determine how much
funding is required “in the coming two or three weeks,” Al-
Mannai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
