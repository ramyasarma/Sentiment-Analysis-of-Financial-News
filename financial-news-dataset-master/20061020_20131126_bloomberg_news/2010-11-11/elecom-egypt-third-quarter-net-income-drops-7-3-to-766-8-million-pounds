Telecom Egypt , the country’s
monopoly fixed-line phone-service provider, said third-quarter
profit fell 7.3 percent on lower income from associate
companies.  Net income  attributable to equity holders decreased to
766.1 million Egyptian pounds ($133.3 million), from 826.4
million pounds in the year-earlier period, the Cairo-based
company said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.
Revenue rose 1.7 percent to 2.58 billion pounds. Earnings per
share declined to 45 piasters from 48 piasters. Profit from
associate companies fell 25 percent to 291.1 million pounds.  “The drop in net profit in the third quarter relates to
non-operational items,” Chief Executive Officer  Tarek Tantawy ,
said in a telephone interview. “We are on track however on
delivering our full-year guidance on growth and margins.”  Telecom Egypt is seeking to increase its investment in the
mobile-phone market and is exploring a number of options, he
said.  Vodafone Group Plc , the world’s largest mobile-phone
company, said on June 1 it won’t sell its 55 percent stake in
its Egyptian unit to Telecom Egypt.  Beltone Financial, a Cairo-based investment bank, said
Telecom Egypt’s third-quarter revenue came in line with its
expectations and reiterated its “buy” recommendation with a
target price of 22.63 Egyptian pounds.  Telecom Egypt shares  fell 0.5 percent to 17.38 pounds at
the 2:30 p.m. stock market close, valuing the company at 29.7
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
