Newcastle midfielder  Joey Barton 
accepted a violent conduct charge by the Football Association
for striking Blackburn’s  Morten Gamst Pedersen  during a Premier
League soccer game.  Television replays showed Barton hitting Pedersen in the
chest during Blackburn’s 2-1 win at St. James’ Park yesterday.
The F.A. said it acted after the referee missed the incident.  “I fully accept that I was in the wrong on this occasion
and accept the charge that the F.A. have brought against me,”
Barton said in a statement on Newcastle’s website. “I hold my
hands up, I reacted badly to the situation on Wednesday night
and I deeply regret it.”  The 28-year-old Barton, who also apologized to Pedersen,
will be banned for the Premier League games against Fulham,
Bolton and Chelsea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
