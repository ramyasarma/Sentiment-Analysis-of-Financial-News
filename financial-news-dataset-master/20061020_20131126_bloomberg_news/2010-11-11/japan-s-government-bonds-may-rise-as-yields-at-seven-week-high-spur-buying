Japanese  bond futures  gained for the
first time in six days as signs of slowing growth in Europe
supported demand for the safety of government debt.  Benchmark  bonds  pared their biggest weekly decline since
September as regional stocks slumped. The  extra yield  offered by
20-year bonds over 10-year debt was near the widest in more than
two years before an auction of the longer-maturity securities.  “The drop in stocks spurred investors to unwind their
short positions on bond futures,” said Kazuya Ito, a fund 
manager at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo. “Medium-term 
bonds were bought amid bargain hunting.”  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery gained 0.17 to
142.59 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1.4 percent, paring its advance
this week to 1 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific index of regional
shares slumped 1.5 percent today.  The  yield  on the 10-year bond lost one basis point to 0.995
percent as of 3:31 p.m. in Tokyo at the Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The price of the 1
percent security due September 2020 rose 0.089 yen to 100.044
yen. The yield jumped 6.5 basis points this week, the most since
the five days ended Sept. 3.  Europe’s gross domestic product grew 0.5 percent in the
third quarter, half as fast as in the previous three months,
according to economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
Europe Union’s statistics office will release the report today.  The spread between yields on Japan’s 20- and 10-year bonds
was 90 basis points, after reaching 90.9 basis points on Oct.
29, the widest since March 2008.  20-Year Auction  “The moves of 20-year debt seem to suggest investors are
already preparing for the auction next week,”  Kazuhiko Sano ,
chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., one of the 24
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales, wrote
in a report today.  The Ministry of Finance will sell 1.1 trillion-yen ($13.4
billion) of 20-year debt on Nov. 18. Primary dealers often
reduce holdings of bonds before an auction in case prices
decline before they can pass on the new securities to investors.  Gains in bonds were tempered as the yen trading near a one-
month low eased concern a stronger currency will hurt exporters’
earnings. The yen has fallen 1.4 percent versus the dollar this
week, the biggest drop since the period ended Sept. 17. It
reached 82.80 on Nov. 10, the lowest since Oct. 7.  “With the yen in the midst of a correction, domestic
stocks will possibly climb further,” said  Shinji Nomura , chief
debt strategist in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., one
of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt
sales. “The surroundings are unfavorable for Japan’s bond
market, sending debt investors to the sideline.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
