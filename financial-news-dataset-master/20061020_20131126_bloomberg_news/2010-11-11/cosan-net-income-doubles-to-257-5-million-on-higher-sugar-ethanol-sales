Cosan SA Industria & Comercio , which
shares control of the world’s largest sugar-cane processor with
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc , said fiscal second-quarter profit more
than doubled on higher sales of sugar and ethanol.  Net income  in the quarter ending Sept. 30 climbed to 439.7
million reais ($257.5 million) from 173.4 million reais a year
earlier, the Barra Bonita, Brazil-based company said late
yesterday in a regulatory filing. The company was expected to
post profit excluding some items of 221.3 million reais, the
 average  estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Revenue jumped 32 percent to 4.72 billion reais in the
period. Sugar sales increased after Cosan sold inventories
accumulated in the previous quarter, said Ativa Corretora
analyst  Ricardo Correa , who doesn’t rate the stock.  “Bigger volume and higher prices for sugar and ethanol
mean better margins,” Correa said in a telephone interview from
Rio de Janeiro before the results were announced.  Sugar sales rose 43 percent to 1.1 billion reais from the
year-earlier period. Ethanol sales rose 62 percent to 532.4
million reais.  Profit was also bolstered after the Brazilian real’s 7
percent appreciation in the quarter pared the value of foreign
debt in local-currency terms, which is booked as a gain under
local accounting rules. The company posted a quarterly  financial
gain  of 80.1 million reais, compared with a gain of 78.9 million
reais a year earlier.  Cuts Estimates  Cosan also cut its estimates for the fiscal year that ends
Dec. 31 because of lower crop yields that will reduce the
production of sugar and cane crushing. Sugar sales will fall to
between 4.1 million and 4.5 million metric tons, from an earlier
forecast of as much as 5.1 million tons June 10.  Cane crushing is estimated at between 54 million and 58
million tons, from as much as 62 million tons previously. The
company kept unchanged its estimate for net sales of as much as
18.5 billion reais.  Cosan and The Hague-based Shell agreed in August to combine
sugar, ethanol and fuel distribution assets. Shell will
contribute as much as $1.95 billion of cash and 2,740 service
stations. Cosan will put up its 23 cane-crushing mills, 1,730
gas stations, eight power-plant projects and other assets.  Cosan fell 0.3 percent to close at 28.30 reais in Sao Paulo
trading yesterday. Earnings were released after market closed.
The shares have risen 11 percent so far this year, while
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index has risen 4.4 percent.  The company didn’t report per-share profit figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
