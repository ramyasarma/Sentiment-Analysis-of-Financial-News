South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  rose 42.24, or 0.1 percent, to 31,560.07 at the 5

rand, or 2.5 percent, to 335.80 rand. The mining company said
shipments from its Collahuasi mine in Chile aren’t being
affected by a wage strike. Copper surged to a record in London
after China’s inflation accelerated at the highest pace in two

producer of gold, surged 7.13 rand, or 2 percent, to 357 rand.
The company posted net income of 443 million rand ($64.4
