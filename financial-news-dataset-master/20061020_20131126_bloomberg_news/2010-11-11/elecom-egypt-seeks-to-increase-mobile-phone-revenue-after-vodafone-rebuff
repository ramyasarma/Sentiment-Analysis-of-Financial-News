Telecom Egypt , the country’s fixed-
line telephone monopoly, is seeking to increase its investment
in the mobile-phone market, Tarek Tantawy, chief executive
officer and managing director, said.  “Our discussions with Vodafone have been basically put on
hold and we continue to explore other options which I will not
be able to go in to detail,” Tantawy said in a telephone
interview. “We continue to explore options and there are other
ways of getting exposure.”  Vodafone Group Plc, the world’s largest mobile-phone
company, said on June 1 it won’t sell its 55 percent stake in
its Egyptian unit to Telecom Egypt.  Telecom Egypt, which owns 45 percent of Vodafone Egypt, the
country’s second-largest mobile-phone operator, had approached
Vodafone about the stake, a person familiar with the matter said
in May.  Cairo-based Telecom Egypt is focusing its expansion plans
on Egypt and not abroad, Tantawy said after the company released
its third-quarter earnings. “Our aim is to become a total
communication provider in our home country,” he said.  Egyptian broadband penetration, currently at 6 percent of
households, is expected to grow five-fold within the next couple
of years, Tantawy said.  Shares of Telecom Egypt fell 0.3 percent to 17.4 Egyptian
pounds at 11:59 a.m. in Cairo, valuing the company at 29.7
billion pounds ($5.16 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
