IPIC GMTN Ltd., a unit of Abu Dhabi
government-owned International Petroleum Investment Co.,
received AA long-term senior unsecured debt ratings for its $1
billion of five-year and $1.5 billion of 10-year bonds by
Standard & Poor’s, the third-highest investment grade.  Payment of amounts due on the notes is “unconditionally
and irrevocably guaranteed” by International Petroleum, also
known as IPIC, the ratings firm said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Although the government does not formally guarantee
IPIC’s liabilities, we equalize the ratings on IPIC with those
on the government of Abu Dhabi,” analyst  Kai Stukenbrock  wrote.
“Accordingly, we consider that extraordinary government support
in times of financial stress is ‘almost certain’.”  A $1 billion portion of five-year notes may yield 195 basis
points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, and $1.5
billion of 10-year notes may pay a spread of 245 basis points, a
person familiar with the transaction said Nov. 9.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
