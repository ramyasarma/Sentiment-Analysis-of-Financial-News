Bluestar Adisseo Nutrition Group,
the French animal-nutrition company backed by  China National
Chemical Corp. , is seeking HK$12.08 billion ($1.56 billion) in a
Hong Kong initial public offering, according to a term sheet
sent to investors.  Bluestar  Adisseo  is offering 2.3 billion shares, or 25
percent of the company, at HK$3.50 to HK$5.25, the document
shows. Pricing the stock at the top end of the range would give
the company a market capitalization of about $6.23 billion.
 Deutsche Bank AG  and  Morgan Stanley  are managing the sale.  The company will use 40 percent of the IPO proceeds to
expand and upgrade its European plants, and another 40 percent
to develop its feed business, according to the term sheet.  The stock offered includes 50 percent new shares and 50
percent existing equity from China National Bluestar Group
Corp., a unit of China National Chemical. China National
Bluestar bought Adisseo Group for $480 million in 2006.  Bluestar Adisseo plans to set the price for its shares on
Nov. 24 in Asia and start trading on Nov. 30 with the ticker
1095, the terms show.  To contact the reporters for this story:
