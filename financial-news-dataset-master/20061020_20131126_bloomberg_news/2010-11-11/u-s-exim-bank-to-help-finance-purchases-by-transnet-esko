The U.S. Export-Import Bank will
help finance purchases by Transnet Ltd. and Eskom Holdings Ltd.,
the state-owned South African transport and electricity
utilities, said Fred Hochberg, the chairman of the Washington-
based lender.  The bank will provide support for the sale of General
Electric Co. locomotives to Transnet and engineering services by
Kansas-based Black & Veatch Corp. to Eskom, Hochberg said in a
statement late yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
