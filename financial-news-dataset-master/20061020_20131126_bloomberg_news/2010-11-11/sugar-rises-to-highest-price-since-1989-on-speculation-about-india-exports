Raw sugar plunged the most in more
than two years on signals that India may have a larger-than-
expected surplus and after the European Union announced plans to
expand exports. Coffee also declined, while cocoa gained.  The sugar surplus in India, the second-biggest producer,
may be 3.5 million metric tons in the year that began Oct. 1,
after 4 million tons are set aside for the next season, the
government said today. A sugar-factory cooperative has predicted
a surplus of 2 million tons. The EU said it will allow an
additional 350,000 tons of sugar exports in the 12 months ending
in September.  “There has been a great deal of speculation about when and
how much India will export,”  Michael McDougall , a senior vice
president at Newedge USA, said today by e-mail. “The EU news is
negative.”  Raw sugar for March delivery slumped 3.15 cents, or 9.6
percent, to settle at 29.66 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York the biggest drop since March 17, 2008.  Earlier, prices rose to 33.39 cents, the highest level for
a most-active contract since January 1981. Raw-sugar has more
than doubled since touching a 13-month low on May 7 as adverse
weather damaged crops in Russia, China and Brazil, the biggest
producer of the sweetener.  Commodity prices also were pressured by a stronger dollar,
McDougall said.  The euro slid to a one-month low against the greenback. The
U.S. Dollar Index, which values the currency against the euro
and five other counterparts, advanced for a fifth straight
session on renewed concern that some European countries will
struggle to cut budget deficits.  The EU will also lift the duty of 98 euros ($134) a ton on
most-favored-nation imports of raw cane sugar from Dec. 1
through next August, according to a statement from the European
Commission, the EU’s executive arm.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery lost
$22.10, or 2.8 percent, to $768.60 a ton on NYSE Liffe. The
commodity earlier rose to $811 a ton, the highest price for a
most-active contract since at least January 1989.  “Possible demand resistance, due to high prices, may
provoke more significant pressure on futures, a trend which is
already observed in the market,” according to a report by
FCStone Group Inc.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery lost 5.45 cents,
or 2.5 percent, to $2.095 a pound in New York. In London,
robusta-coffee futures for January delivery fell for the second
day, declining $53, or 2.7 percent, to $1,931 a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Cocoa futures for March delivery rose $11, or 0.4 percent,
to $2,866 a ton in New York. The chocolate ingredient has gained
1.2 percent this month. In London, cocoa futures for Decmber
delivery fell 1 pound, or 0.1 percent, to 1,846 pounds ($2,975)
a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
