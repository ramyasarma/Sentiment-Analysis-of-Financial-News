Hochtief AG , Germany’s largest
construction company, said third-quarter profit rose 55 percent
as Australian infrastructure and mining projects expanded and
the euro declined from a year earlier.  Net income increased to 54.6 million euros ($75.2 million)
from 35.3 million euros in the 2009 period, Essen-based Hochtief
said today in a  statement . Profit beat the 42.1 million-euro
average analyst estimate. Sales increased 1.7 percent to 4.68
billion euros.  The company, which is fending off a takeover bid from
Spanish builder  Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA ,
controls Leighton Holdings Ltd., Australia’s biggest
construction company. Hochtief’s Asia-Pacific division, its
largest unit, increased sales by 5.8 percent in the quarter.  “On an international scale, our company has an outstanding
position,” Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Luetkestratkoetter 
said in the statement.  Hochtief  rose  as much as 77 cents, or 1.2 percent, to 63.41
euros and was up 0.7 percent as of 9:16 a.m. in Frankfurt
trading. The stock has risen 18 percent this year.  New orders fell 11 percent to 6.41 billion euros, while the
backlog at the end of September was 17 percent higher than a
year earlier at 41.4 billion euros. Earnings were boosted by the
Australian and U.S. dollars’ gains versus the euro, the
company said.  The company reiterated a full-year forecast today that new
orders and the backlog will rise from 2009 levels, with sales
matching last year’s figure and pretax profit and net income
rising “slightly.”  Concession Unit’s Disposal  The builder said yesterday that it aims to sell a majority
stake in its concessions unit in 2011 and a holding in real
estate operations “as early as 2012,” a year earlier than
previously announced. Hochtief shelved a planned initial public
offering for the concessions unit last year.  Pretax profit in the next three years will total about
1 billion euros annually, while net income will amount to 600
million euros in 2011, 500 million euros in 2012 and 450 million
euros in 2013 following the disposals, Hochtief said today.  Hochtief said it’s considering acquisitions in Canada and
expanding operations in India by buying a stake in existing
businesses and setting up a single entity there. The company
also said it’s sticking to plans to combine its European
construction, real-estate and services operations into a single
regional unit, resulting in 40 million euros savings a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
