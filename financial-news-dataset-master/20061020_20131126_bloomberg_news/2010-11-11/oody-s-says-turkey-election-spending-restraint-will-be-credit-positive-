Moody’s Investors Service said
limits by the government on spending ahead of next year’s
general election would have a positive impact on the country’s
credit.  “If the government spending is quite restrained during the
pre-election period this will be something that we would
consider to be credit-positive, which doesn’t mean an upgrade,”
Moody’s analyst Sarah Carlson said in an interview in Istanbul
today. She declined comment on the timing and size of any
upgrade.  An estimate by the central bank that it may start
increasing the benchmark interest rate in the fourth quarter of
next year is “reasonable” and “much what I would expect,”
Carlson said.  Moody’s rates Turkey Ba2 and raised its outlook to
“positive” from “stable” on Oct. 5 saying debt management
had improved and the economy had revived to pre-crisis levels.
Turkish parliamentary elections are due by July next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
