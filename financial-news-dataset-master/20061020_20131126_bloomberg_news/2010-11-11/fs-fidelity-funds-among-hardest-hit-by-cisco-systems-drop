Mutual funds run by Fidelity
Investments and MFS Investment Management were among the
hardest-hit by today’s declines in  Cisco Systems Inc ., according
to research firm Morningstar Inc.  The $179 million  MFS Technology Fund  had 7 percent of
assets in Cisco as of Aug. 31, the most among all actively
managed stock funds, Morningstar data show. The $17.3 million
 Fidelity Advisor Communications Equipment Fund  had 6.7 percent
in Cisco as of Sept. 30, and the $447 million  Fidelity Select
Communications Equipment Portfolio  held 6.6 percent. They were
the third and fourth most-affected funds.  Cisco, the world’s largest maker of computer-networking
equipment, tumbled 16 percent in Nasdaq trading today after its
profit and sales forecast fell short of analysts’ estimates
because of increased competition and lower government spending.
The drop, its biggest one-day decline in 16 years, wiped out
Cisco’s gains since Sept. 2.  Cisco, based in San Jose, California, declined $3.97 to
$20.52 at 4:29 p.m. in New York.  The MFS fund, if it retained its holding, stood to lose
about $2 million on the stock, or 1.1 percent of assets. Before
today the fund had gained 18 percent this year, beating 62
percent of technology-focused funds, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  John Reilly , a spokesman for MFS, said the company doesn’t
comment on specific holdings. MFS, which managed $190 billion as
of Aug. 31, is a unit of Toronto-based  Sun Life Financial Inc.   Rydex Fund  The $187 million Rydex Internet Fund, with about 6.9
percent in Cisco as of Sept. 30, had the second-highest
weighting, according to Chicago-based Morningstar. The fund was
up 23 percent this year, beating 91 percent of competing funds,
Bloomberg data showed.  The $156 billion  Growth Fund of America , managed by Los
Angeles-based Capital Group Cos.’ American Funds unit, owned the
largest number of Cisco shares, or 76.2 million as of June 30.
That represented 1.2 percent of the fund’s assets.  Chuck Freadhoff , a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment.  Fidelity Advisor Communications rose 23 percent this year,
ahead of 83 percent of rivals, while Fidelity Select
Communications gained 22 percent, beating 67 percent of
competitors.  Fidelity, the world’s second-largest mutual fund company,
managed $1.24 trillion as of July 31.  Adam Banker , a spokesman
for the Boston-based firm, declined to comment.  A call to Rydex in Rockville, Maryland, wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
