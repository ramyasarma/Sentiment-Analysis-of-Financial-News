The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is
likely to retreat to its 20-day moving average, a level about
1.7 percent below its current price, before rebounding to a new
high for the year, said Katie Stockton, chief market technician
at MKM Partners LLC.  The S&P 500, which closed at a two-year high of 1,225.85 on
Nov. 5, “appears poised for a pullback” based on several
market indicators, Stockton said in a report today. They include
measures of short-term momentum, the percentage of stocks that
are overbought from a short-term perspective, and a surge in
sell signals based on DeMark market-timing indicators, the
report said.  The main benchmark for American equities fell 0.4 percent
to 1,214.46 as of 2:42 p.m. today after  Cisco Systems Inc. , the
biggest maker of computer networking equipment, reported sales
and profit that fell short of analyst estimates.  Should the S&P 500 retreat to its  20-day average , currently
about 1,194, investors should examine whether “short-term
overbought conditions have been sufficiently relieved to
regenerate short-term positive momentum,” Stockton, who is
based in Stamford, Connecticut, said. Intermediate- and long-
term momentum remain positive and suggest the index will top
1,230 in the coming weeks, she said.  A decline below the 20-day average is likely to pause
around 1,130, close to the index’s 200-day average and a level
at which rallies stalled in June and August, Stockton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
