Here’s your chance to walk in
 Bernard Madoff ’s shoes, sleep in his bed and work out on his
dusty treadmill.  The U.S. Marshals Service on Saturday is auctioning almost
500 lots of clothing, furniture, jewelry and knickknacks
recovered from Madoff’s former Manhattan penthouse and Montauk,
New York, beach house. It has a total presale estimate of $1.5
million to $2 million.  A Madoff auction a year ago was notable for the 50 watches
amassed by the man behind the $65 billion Ponzi scheme. At
Saturday’s all-day bazaar at the Sheraton New York Hotel &
Towers, the shoe collection recalls that of the former First
Lady of the Philippines. Although thousands were attributed to
 Imelda Marcos , the Madoff collection on offer amounts to about
200 pairs.  There are 44 men’s sport coats, size 42. Two dozen worsted
double-breasted suits are estimated at a total of $480 to $690.
And there are hundreds of sweaters, polo shirts, and custom-made
monogrammed Charvet dress shirts, as well as clothing owned by
his wife, Ruth.  “On the clothing, I don’t know if I would say
compulsive,” said Bob Sheehan, owner of the auctioneer  Gaston &
Sheehan , which is handling the sale. “But once they had a style
of sweater, they bought one in every color.”  For whom the shoe fits (Bernie wore size 9 wide, Ruth wore
7, 7 1/2 and 8 U.S. and 37 to 38.5 European), the auction offers
potential bargains. About 100 pairs of his “Mr. Casual” models
hail from the Manhattan shoe store  Belgian Shoes . They retail
for $350 and up, according to the store’s  website . Many are
loafers.  No Comment  In one lot, the auction offers 18 new pairs -- which Madoff
bought and apparently didn’t wear -- for a low estimate of $900,
which comes to $50 a pair.  A woman who answered the phone at Belgian Shoes said the
store didn’t wish to be associated with the sale and declined to
comment.  A cache of 15 pairs of Ruth’s Prada shoes and  Ralph Lauren 
shoes and boots are estimated at $270 to $380. ( Jill Sander ,
Armani and  Jimmy Choo  are also represented.)  The auction offers mementos of Madoff’s life before he was
turned in by his sons, pleaded guilty to running the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history and began a 150-year federal prison term
in North Carolina.  There’s the platinum custom ring set with an emerald cut
diamond that Bernie gave Ruth for their engagement, according to
the Marshals Service (estimate: $300,000 to $350,000). The
Madoffs slept in an early-19th-century George III mahogany and
satinwood tester bed ($8,000 to $11,400, mattress not included).
They ate on a Regency mahogany dining table with two leaves,
seating at least 10 ($3,000 to $4,000).  Baseball Cap  Included in a lot of women’s ski clothes and hats is a
baseball cap adorned with “ Atlantic Golf Club ,” the
Bridgehampton, New York, country club ($180 to $260). A leather
foot stool fashioned as a bull is estimated at $250 to $360.  All items are sold without commission. They’re on view
tomorrow at the Brooklyn Navy  Yard . For more information, see

victims, according to the Marshals Service. The sale is at 811
7th Ave. and starts at 10 a.m.  To contact the reporter on the story:
