Taiwan’s central bank has told banks
not to place currency orders a half-hour before the currency
market closes, the Commercial Times reported, citing bank
executives it didn’t identify.  The central bank previously said banks must stop placing
orders 15 minutes before the close of trading, according to the
Taipei-based Chinese-language daily.  This measure aims to prevent disruptions to the central
bank’s intervention in the currency market at the end of the
trading day, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
