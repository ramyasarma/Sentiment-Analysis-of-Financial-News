Northern League leader Umberto
Bossi, an ally of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said
it’s still possible to avoid a full-blown government crisis,
Ansa reported today.  “A managed crisis is better than” going into “the
darkness,” Bossi told reporters today in Rome, Ansa said, after
talks with Gianfranco Fini, Berlusconi’s former ally who has
threatened to withdraw his ministers if the prime minister
doesn’t step down.  Bossi said Fini “mostly” agreed with the idea of
Berlusconi stepping down if he were assured of being reappointed
as prime minister and tasked with forming a new government, Ansa
said. Bossi rejected a demand by Fini that the opposition 
Union of Centrists party be brought into the government, Ansa
reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
