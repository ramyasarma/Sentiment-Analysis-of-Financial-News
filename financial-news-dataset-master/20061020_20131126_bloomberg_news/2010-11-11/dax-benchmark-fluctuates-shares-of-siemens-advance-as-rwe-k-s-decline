Most German stocks fell as declines
in K+S AG and  RWE AG  shares overshadowed a rise in  Siemens AG .  Siemens  surged 2.6 percent as the company plans to boost
its dividend more than analysts had predicted, after resurging
economic growth bolstered manufacturing at Europe’s largest
engineering company.  K+S AG , Europe’s largest potash supplier,
fell 2.6 percent after the company’s sales outlook for 2011
disappointed analysts.  Sky Deutschland AG  advanced 12 percent as
third-quarter sales rose.  The DAX  gained less than 0.1 percent to 6,723.41 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, with almost two stocks falling for
each one that rose. The measure increased 2.3 percent last week
as the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it will buy a further
$600 billion of bonds in an attempt to bolster the world’s
largest economy. The broader HDAX Index slipped 0.1 percent
today.  “The earnings season as a whole was very strong,” said
 Markus Wallner , a senior equity strategist at  Commerzbank AG  in
Frankfurt. “Analysts are looking deep into the numbers and some
companies are getting punished if they don’t quite match the
numbers. It’s also more difficult for companies in the third
quarter as analysts have raised their estimates compared to the
first and second quarters. The DAX can still reach 6,900 by the
end of the year.”  About 71 percent of the 28 companies on the DAX that have
announced results since Oct. 7 have beaten analyst estimates for
per-share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Siemens, K+S  Siemens gained 2.6 percent to 85.34 euros, the highest
close since March 2008. The company’s proposed dividend payout
of 2.70 euros compares with an estimate of 2 euros a share in a
Bloomberg survey. For the last three years, Siemens had kept its
dividend at 1.60 euros.  The Munich-based company said today that sales in the
fiscal fourth-quarter through Sept. 30 rose 7.7 percent to 21.23
billion euros ($29.27 billion). Siemens had a loss from a
writedown at its health-care unit.  K+S lost 2.6 percent to 50.73 euros, the biggest decline
since June. Sales volumes of potash and magnesium products will
just exceed 7 million tons next year, up from the expected 6.7
million tons to 6.9 million tons in 2010, Kassel-based K+S said
in a statement. The company reported third-quarter net income of
76.8 million euros, up from 3.7 million euros.  “No surprise, but sobering 2011 guidance,” said  Wolfgang Fickus , an analyst at  WestLB AG .  RWE Declines  RWE , Germany’s second-biggest utility, declined 1.5 percent
to 50.25 euros, the largest retreat in a month.  “The U.K. division showed disappointing results,”  Mario Kristl , a Frankfurt-based analyst at DZ Bank AG, wrote in a
report today. “RWE should also increase its cost savings
target.” The analyst said he expects “a decrease in operating
result of around 9 percent” in the financial year 2011.  The profit gauge, which RWE uses to calculate its dividend,
was 3.2 billion euros ($4.4 billion) compared with 2.9 billion
euros in the same period a year earlier, the Essen, Germany-
based company said in a statement on its website today.  Sky Deutschland jumped 12 percent to 1.26 euros. The pay-
television operator said sales in the third quarter rose to
243.2 million euros from 208.5 million euros in the year-earlier
period. The loss after tax in the period narrowed to 89.3
million euros from 116.7 million euros.  Fielmann AG added 1.4 percent to 67.13 euros, erasing
yesterday’s 1 percent drop. Europe’s largest chain of opticians
reported that third-quarter net income rose to 36.6 million
euros from 32.5 million euros. Sales increased, the company said
in an e-mailed statement.  United Internet  United Internet AG sank 9.2 percent to 11.78 euros, the
largest decline since March 2009. The Internet service provider
said nine-month pretax profit fell 8.3 percent because of
“scheduled depreciation” on Freenet AG’s digital subscriber-
line customer base, which was acquired last year.  Conergy AG  slumped 9.9 percent to 43 euro cents as the
solar company reported a 4.3 million-euro net loss in the third
quarter.  Solarworld AG  lost 7.1 percent to 8.90 euros after
saying the German market has been slightly slower since the
third quarter and the company will need up to 300 million euros
to boost its output.  Rational AG  tumbled 6 percent to 153.25 euros. The maker of
industrial ovens was downgraded to “underperform” from
“outperform” at CA Cheuvreux, which said it recommends
“investors take profits and await more attractive entry
levels.”  DZ Bank AG cut its recommendation on the stock to “hold”
from “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
