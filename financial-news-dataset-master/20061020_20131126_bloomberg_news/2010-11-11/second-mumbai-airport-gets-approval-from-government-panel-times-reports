An Indian government environmental
panel has approved a revised proposal for a second airport in
Mumbai, the Economic Times reported, citing a civil aviation
ministry spokesman it didn’t identify. The approval is subject
to changing the location of non-aeronautical support facilities
at the proposed airport and planting of mangroves to minimize
damage to environment, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
