Hungary’s annual  inflation  rate
advanced more than economists forecast in October driven by
rising food prices, which analysts said will remain a risk to
drive price increases.  Inflation accelerated to 4.2 percent from 3.8 percent in
September, the statistics office in Budapest said today. The
median estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 4
percent. Prices rose 0.4 percent from September, the first
increase in three months.  The central bank, which will publish updated economic
forecasts this month, raised its inflation estimate for the next
two years in August, citing a weaker currency and rising energy
costs. The rising price pressure has eliminated the room for
rate cuts, monetary policy makers said. The central bank, which
targets 3 percent inflation, kept the  benchmark interest rate 
unchanged at 5.25 percent for a sixth month on Oct. 25.  “Food prices remain a key risk going forward,”  Zsolt Kondrat , economist at Bayerische Landebank’s unit in Budapest
said in a note to clients today. The government’s plan to extend
extra industry taxes beyond 2012 boosts inflation risks as
companies will seek to pass on the extra levy to consumers, he
said.  Forint Drops  The forint weakened 0.8 percent to 276.6 versus the euro by
10:42 a.m. in Budapest, the second-worst performance among 25
emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the
Philippine peso. The yield on the benchmark five-year bond rose
to 7.002 percent from 6.971 percent, Bloomberg data show.  Food prices rose 5.3 percent in October from a year earlier
after increasing 3.9 percent in September. They gained 1.5
percent on the month, compared with a decline of 0.4 percent in
September.  “It seems prices have become more sensitive to the forint’s
movement compared to last year when the pass-through effect of a
weaker currency was quite modest,”  David Nemeth , economist at
ING Groep NV in Budapest said in an e-mailed note. The central
bank will continue its “wait-and-see” approach this year while
the chance of a 25 basis-point rate increase in the first
quarter of 2011 is on the rise, he said.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank on Nov. 30 will probably keep its
benchmark two-week deposit rate unchanged, according to all
eight economists in a Bloomberg  survey .  The price growth of electricity and gas advanced an annual
6.2 percent in October from 5.5 percent in September. The cost
of motor fuel rose 6.6 percent after 6.3 percent in September.  Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy
prices, was an annual 1.8 percent in October.  Annual average inflation will be 4.7 percent in 2010, the
central bank said on Aug. 23. For 2011 and 2012, the bank raised
its inflation forecasts by 0.5 percentage point to 3.5 percent
and 3.4 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
