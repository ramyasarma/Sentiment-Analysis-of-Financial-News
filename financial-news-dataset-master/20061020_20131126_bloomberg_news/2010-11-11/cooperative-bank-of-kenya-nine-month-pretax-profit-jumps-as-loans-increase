Cooperative Bank of Kenya Ltd., the
East African nation’s fourth-biggest lender by market value,
said nine-month profit surged 54 percent as income from loans
increased.  Net income climbed to 4.38 billion shillings ($54.4
million) in the period through September, from 2.85 billion
shillings a year earlier, Managing Director Gideon Muriuki told
reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. Net interest income,
the amount banks earn from interest on loans, increased 30
percent to 6.37 billion shillings, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
