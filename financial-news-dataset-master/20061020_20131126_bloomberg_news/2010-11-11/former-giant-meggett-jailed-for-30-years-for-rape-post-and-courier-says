Former New York Giants running back
 David Meggett  was sentenced to 30 years in prison for burglary
and rape,  the Post and Courier reported .  Meggett, 44, was charged after an encounter with a woman
inside a home in North Charleston, South Carolina, in 2009, the
newspaper said. Beattie Butler, his attorney, said yesterday’s
conviction will be appealed.  Meggett also faces charges in a September 2008 incident in
which he allegedly forced a teenager to have sex, the newspaper
reported.  Meggett played for the Giants from 1989 to 1994. He then
spent three seasons with the New England Patriots and ended his
National Football League career in 1998 with the New York Jets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
