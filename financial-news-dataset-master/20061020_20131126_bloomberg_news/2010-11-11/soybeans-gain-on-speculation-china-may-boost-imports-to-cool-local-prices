Soybeans rose in Chicago on
speculation that China, the world’s biggest importer, may
increase purchases to help cool domestic food prices and on a
reduced estimate for U.S. stockpiles.  China’s imports may climb 39 percent from a month earlier
to 5.2 million metric tons in November, the China National Grain
& Oils Information Center said in a report today. U.S.
inventories before next year’s harvest will total 5 million
tons, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a  report  on
Nov. 9. That’s down 30 percent from an October forecast.  “China’s soybean import demand continues at a robust
pace,” said  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an analyst at Barclays
Capital in London. The USDA report “reflected further
tightening in grains balances and thinner inventory levels,”
she said.  Soybeans for January delivery added 5.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $13.2475 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The oilseed has climbed 26 percent this
year on rising demand from China and reached a 26-month high of
$13.4475 on Nov. 9.  As of Oct. 28, exporters in the U.S., the world’s largest
soybean grower and shipper, agreed to sell 17.6 million tons to
China for shipment from Sept. 1, the USDA said. Food prices
gained 10.1 percent in October, China’s statistics bureau said
today. That was the biggest advance since August 2008, according
to  data  tracked by Bloomberg.  Inflation in China  China may allow the yuan to appreciate by 5 percent in the
next 12 months, lowering its import costs and slowing inflation
by an estimated 0.3 percent, according to a Deutsche Bank AG
report dated yesterday. Consumer prices rose a more-than-
forecast 4.4 percent from a year earlier, the highest in two
years, a statistics bureau report showed in Beijing today.  Soybean output in Mato Grosso, Brazil’s biggest producing
state, will remain at 18.8 million tons next year, the first
time production will fail to grow since 2007, after dryness
delayed planting and prompted farmers to favor cotton, Glauber
Silveira Silva, head of the Mato Grosso Soybean Producers
Association, said in an interview Nov. 9. The state grows 30
percent of the nation’s soybean crop.  Brazil, forecast to supply 32 percent of global soybean
exports, was estimated to harvest 67.5 million tons in the year
that began Oct. 1, according to the USDA. The nation is the
world’s second-largest grower and shipper.  Many agricultural commodities including corn, soybeans and
wheat are “still cheap” even after recent rallies, Michael
Lewis, global head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank,
said in an interview yesterday.  Corn for March delivery gained 3.25 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $5.8425 a bushel and has increased 41 percent this year.  December-delivery wheat added 2.25 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $7.1225 a bushel, bringing this year’s climb to 32 percent.
Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
slipped 0.2 percent to 221.75 euros ($304.82) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
