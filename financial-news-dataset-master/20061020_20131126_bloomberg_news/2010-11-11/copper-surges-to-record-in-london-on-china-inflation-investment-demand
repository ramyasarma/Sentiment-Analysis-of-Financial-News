Copper jumped to its highest ever
after China’s inflation reached a two-year high, prompting
investors to seek commodities as a hedge against accelerating
consumer prices.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 2.1 percent to a record $8,945 a metric
ton, surpassing its previous peak of $8,940 a ton reached in
July 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
