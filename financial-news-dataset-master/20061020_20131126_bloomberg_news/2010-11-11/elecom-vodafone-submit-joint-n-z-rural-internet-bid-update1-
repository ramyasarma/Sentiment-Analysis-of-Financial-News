Telecom Corp of New Zealand Ltd . and
 Vodafone Group Plc , the country’s two largest telecommunications
groups, submitted a joint bid to build a broadband internet
network across New Zealand’s rural areas.  The proposal is the companies’ joint response to the
government’s Rural Broadband Initiative, which seeks to provide
broadband to 97 percent of rural schools and 80 percent of rural
homes within six years, according to a statement today. Under
the proposal, Telecom and Vodafone will also invest more in
their own networks in the areas.  The companies plan to combine their resources by extending
Telecom’s existing cable infrastructure and Vodafone’s wireless
network, according to the statement. The bid process for the RBI
is being managed by the Ministry of Economic Development and a
decision is expected by Christmas, the statement said.  “By collaborating, our companies are showing that the
telecommunications industry is working for the good of New
Zealand,” Telecom’s Chief Executive Officer  Paul Reynolds  said
in the statement.  If the companies’ joint bid is accepted, any material
changes to Telecom’s earnings guidance will be “unlikely,” the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
