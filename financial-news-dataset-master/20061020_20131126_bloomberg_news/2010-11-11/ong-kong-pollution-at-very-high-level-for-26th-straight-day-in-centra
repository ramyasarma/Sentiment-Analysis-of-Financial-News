Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very” high for the 26th straight day at the Central district
roadside monitoring station, the city’s Environmental Protection
Department said on its website.  All three roadside stations in Hong Kong were “very
high,” with readings above 100 that trigger a government
warning for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  The pollution index read 140 in Central, 111 in Mong Kok
and 108 in Causeway Bay as of 6 a.m., the department said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
