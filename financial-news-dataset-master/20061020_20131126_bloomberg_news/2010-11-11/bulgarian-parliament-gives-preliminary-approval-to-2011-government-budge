Bulgaria’s Parliament approved in a
preliminary vote the 2011 budget plan, which narrows the deficit
target to 2.5 percent of economic output and keeps taxes at the
lowest level in the European Union.  Lawmakers voted 130 to 58 to pass the budget plan that
envisages economic growth of 3.6 percent in 2011, after an
estimated 0.7 percent expansion this year, Finance
Minister  Simeon Djankov  said. The budget still needs item-by-
item votes over the next several weeks.  “ Economic growth  will be driven by exports and a gradual
recovery of domestic consumption,” Djankov told lawmakers in
Sofia today. “We continue our policy of low taxes to improve
the business environment, to stimulate employment and curb tax
evasion.”  Bulgaria is struggling to end its first recession in more
than a decade after a three-year lending boom stalled and
foreign investment dried up during the global financial crisis.
The  European Commission  asked Bulgaria to narrow its  budget gap 
from 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 to below 3
percent of GDP by the end of 2011.  The EU’s poorest country in terms of per-capita GDP raised
the obligatory contribution paid by employers and workers to the
state pension fund by 1.8 percentage points to 17.8 percent from
next year, while keeping corporate and personal income taxes at
10 percent for a third successive year, the lowest in the 27-
nation bloc.  The government plans to issue debt to cover next year’s
budget gap of 1.96 billion lev ($1.38 billion), Djankov said.  “The main focus of our debt issue policy will be
development of the domestic bond market at a possibly minimal
price and optimal risk level,” Djankov said.  The budget plan allows for a 5.3 percent  revenue  increase
to 25.84 billion lev, or 33.5 percent of GDP, while spending is
estimated at 27.8 billion lev, or 35 percent of GDP, Djankov
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
