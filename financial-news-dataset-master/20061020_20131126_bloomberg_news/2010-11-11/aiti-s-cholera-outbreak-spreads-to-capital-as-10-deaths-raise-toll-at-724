Haiti’s cholera outbreak has spread
to the country’s capital, where 10 deaths raised the number of
people killed by the disease to 724 nationwide, the Health
Ministry said.  The deaths in Port-au-Prince fueled concern that the
epidemic could take hold in tent camps throughout the city
housing many of the 1.3 million left homeless by January’s
earthquake.  “The crowded and unsanitary conditions in the tent camps
put people at higher risk,” said  Daniel Epstein , a spokesman
for an  arm  of the World Health Organization, in a telephone
interview from Washington. “We have every reason to expect
cholera will continue to spread.”  The reported death toll climbed by 81 from a day ago,
compared with an increase of 60 they day before. Of 11,125
reported cases, 278 occurred in the capital of Port-au-Prince,
according to the Haitian  Health Ministry’s website .  The outbreak originated last month in the Artibonite River
valley and isn’t directly linked to the Jan. 12 earthquake that
killed 300,000, according to the ministry.  The disease had been contained in rural areas of northern
and central Haiti until it spread to the capital following
flooding from last week’s Hurricane Tomas.  Health officials have not traced the origins of the
outbreak, Epstein said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
