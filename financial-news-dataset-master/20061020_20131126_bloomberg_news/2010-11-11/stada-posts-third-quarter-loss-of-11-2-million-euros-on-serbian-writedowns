Stada Arzneimittel AG  reported a
third-quarter loss after some Serbian pharmaceutical wholesalers
failed to pay the German generic-drug maker.  The  net loss  was 11.2 million euros ($15.4 million), or 19
cents a share, compared with a profit of 23.2 million euros, or
39 cents, during the same period a year earlier, the Bad Vilbel-
based company said in a statement today. The company confirmed
its earnings target.  Stada warned in October that third-quarter earnings would
be reduced by about 29.5 million euros because some Serbian
wholesalers didn’t have enough cash to pay their bills. Sales
and operating profit will increase for the year if the Serbian
business stabilizes, Stada said.  “Some investors may have expected Stada to cut its
targets,”  Thomas Maul , a Frankfurt-based analyst for DZ Bank,
wrote in a note to investors today. Sales and earnings beat
expectations, Maul said. He rates the shares “buy.”  The shares rose 12.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 23.015 euros
in Frankfurt trading.  Sales climbed 4 percent to 399.7 million euros, beating the
average estimate of 386.3 million euros. The company had total
pretax one-time costs of 49.7 million euros in the quarter.  The shares had lost 3.7 percent  this year  including
reinvested dividends prior to today’s trading, compared with a
7.8 percent return for the  Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical
Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
