Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said he is doubtful Group of 20 nations can resolve
differences on how to tackle global currency and trade
imbalances at a summit in Seoul that ends tomorrow.  “We’re getting a more frank discussion on some of these
matters,” Harper told reporters in the South Korean capital.
“Will they be addressed at this conference? I’m not so sure.”  G-20 nations are struggling to resolve differences over
currency policies blamed for distorting global trade and
investment. Countries from China to Germany have rejected any
move to set a target for current-account surpluses or deficits
as a percentage of gross domestic product.  The U.S. Federal Reserve also has faced criticism from some
G-20 partners for its decision to spend a further $600 billion
on asset purchases to stimulate the economy. Harper defended the
policy, saying the central bank had no other option.  “Nobody is urging the United States to engage in fiscal
expansion,” Harper said. “I think under the circumstances, the
quantitative easing policy is in the short term the only option
available to the Federal Reserve.”  Harper said the recent drop in the U.S. dollar is not
“particularly” surprising. The problem, he said, is that the
Canadian currency is bearing a “disproportionate” burden
because other currencies aren’t appreciating as much as they
should.  To contact the reporters on this story:
