BlueScope Steel Ltd. , Australia’s
largest steelmaker, forecast a  loss  for the fiscal first half
because of rising costs and a strengthening Australian dollar.  A “small” net loss after tax is expected for the period
ending Dec. 31 and slowing local demand may erode earnings, the
Melbourne-based company said today in a statement to the
Australian Stock Exchange. BlueScope posted a A$28.5 million
($29 million) loss in the year-earlier period.  BlueScope joins ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest
steelmaker, in forecasting lower earnings as raw material costs
surge and steel prices decline. The price of hot-rolled coil
steel has declined 11 percent this half as demand weakens.  “We are unlikely to see a sustained recovery until we see
improved economic conditions in the developed economies of the
U.S. and Europe,” Managing Director  Paul O’Malley  said in the
statement, referring to the price of steel. “We’ve seen a
recent softening in Australian domestic demand, particularly in
the industrial market segment.”  BlueScope, which held its annual general meeting in
Melbourne today, rose 4.8 percent to A$1.965 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney.  Gains in the Australian dollar are hurting exporters
including BlueScope that earn revenue in dollars and pay costs
in the local currency. The Australian dollar has appreciated 20
percent this half and is trading above parity with the U.S.
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
