  Deutsche Postbank AG , the German
retail lender controlled by  Deutsche Bank AG , said it expects to
return to profitability “on a sustainable basis” after posting
a fourth-quarter loss.  The net loss was 80 million euros ($110 million) in the
three months ended December, compared with a deficit of 99
million euros in the year-earlier period, the Bonn-based bank
said in an e-mailed statement today. Provisions for risky loans
fell to 112 million euros from 308 million euros.  Deutsche Bank acquired the retail lender as well as
private-wealth manager Sal. Oppenheim last year to reduce
dependence on  investment banking . The Frankfurt-based lender now
owns about 52 percent of Postbank.  Fourth-quarter net interest income, the difference between
what a bank brings in from loans and pays on deposits, rose to
664 million euros from 621 million euros. The Tier 1 capital
ratio, a measure of financial strength, was 8.1 percent at the
end of 2010, up from 6.6 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
