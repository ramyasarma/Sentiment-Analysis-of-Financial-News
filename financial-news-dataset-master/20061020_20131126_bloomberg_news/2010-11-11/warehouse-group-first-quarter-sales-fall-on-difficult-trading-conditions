Warehouse Group Ltd. , New Zealand’s
biggest discount retailer, said first-quarter sales were little
changed amid sluggish consumer spending.  Sales fell 0.2 percent to NZ$362.3 million ($283 million)
in the 13 weeks ended Oct. 31, the Auckland-based company said
in a statement.  Warehouse said sales at the 88 ‘Red Shed’ general
merchandise stores have been curbed by weak consumer spending as
the New Zealand economy recovers from recession. Trading
conditions “were expected to remains difficult for some time
yet,” said Chief Executive Officer  Ian Morrice .  Same-store sales at the 87 Red Sheds fell 1.5 percent led
by a decline in demand for music videos and compact discs, the
company said. Sporting goods, small appliance and jewelry sales
improved. Same-store sales at the 48 Warehouse Stationery
outlets increased 5.3 percent.  “From a group perspective maintaining sales broadly in
line with last year is a satisfactory result in the present
environment,” Morrice said. “The retail market continues to be
highly promotionally driven and we are not yet seeing signs of
any real or sustainable recovery in  consumer spending .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
