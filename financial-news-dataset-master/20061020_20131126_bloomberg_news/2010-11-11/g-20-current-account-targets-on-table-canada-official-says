dismissed the idea of setting targets for current account
imbalances, a Canadian official said.  Targets are still “on the table,” the official said,
speaking to reporters in Seoul on condition he not be
identified. The official also said Canada “fully understands”
the Federal Reserve’s decision to spend a further $600 billion

Asia would mitigate the need for such actions.  Countries from China to Germany have rejected any move to

that a 4 percent of GDP ratio was “likely to emerge as the
basic benchmark countries look to.” He refrained from repeating
that guideline at a gathering of finance ministers from the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kyoto, Japan on Nov.
