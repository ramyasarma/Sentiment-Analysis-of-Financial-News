Erste Group Bank AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Andreas Treichl  made a 654,000 euro ($897,000) gain last
week, when he sold 25,000 Erste shares at almost five times the
price of his previous purchase 19 months earlier.  Treichl, 58, sold the stock on Nov. 4 at an average price
of 33.55 euros, according to the directors’ dealings  records  on
the  website  of Austrian financial regulator FMA. Erste closed at
a six-month high on that day.  Treichl’s previous transaction in Erste shares was on March
2, 2009, when he bought the same number of shares for 7.37
euros, according to  FMA . Since Erste listed in 1997, the stock
has closed lower on only  three days , all in the first quarter of
2009, as European bank shares hit all-time lows on concerns that
rising bad loans might cause mass bank failures.  Treichl’s share purchase occurred on the day that Criteria
CaixaCorp SA, which manages the investments of Spain’s biggest
savings bank, said it bought a 4.9 percent stake in Erste. It
also came shortly after Erste said on Feb. 27, 2009, that it
would raise 2.7 billion euros in capital under a government-
sponsored program.  Treichl missed bonus payments for 2008 and 2009 because of
the financial crisis. His last bonus was 1.76 million euros for
the 2007 business year, to which the marginal income tax rate in
Austria of 50 percent would have applied. His share gain is tax
free, because more than a year passed between purchase and sale.  Erste’s CEO held 209,640 of his bank’s shares at the end of
2009, meaning he now has 184,640 shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
