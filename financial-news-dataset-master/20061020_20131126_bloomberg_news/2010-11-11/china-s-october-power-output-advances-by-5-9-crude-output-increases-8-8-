China’s electricity output growth
rate fell to a 15-month low in October after the local
authorities limited supplies to factories and plants to meet a
mandatory energy efficiency target set by Premier  Wen Jiabao .  Electricity generation rose 5.9 percent to 332.9 billion
kilowatt-hours last month from a year earlier, the Beijing-based
National Bureau of Statistics said today. That’s the slowest
pace since the 4.7 percent increase in July 2009.  China has shut factories and coal mines to help meet Wen’s
goal of cutting the amount of energy consumed for each unit of
gross domestic product by 20 percent in the five years ending
2010. The country’s energy use may be curbed further in the
fourth quarter after easing in July to September, the National
Energy Administration said Oct. 25.  “The slowdown is possibly due to the continuing impact of
power curtailment in regards to achieving energy efficiency
targets before the year-end,” said  Dave Dai , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.  China’s economy grew 9.6 percent in the third quarter, the
smallest increase in a year, as the government reined in credit
growth, clamped down on property speculation and chased energy-
efficiency and pollution targets. Factory output rose 13.3
percent in September from a year earlier, missing the median 14
percent estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 23 economists.  Heavy industries used 193.9 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity in September, down 17 percent from the previous
month, the National Energy Administration said last month.
Overall, China’s power demand fell 12 percent to 349.8 billion
kilowatt-hours compared with August.  The country’s October crude-oil output rose 8.8 percent to
17.76 million metric tons, according to the statistics bureau.  -- Chua Baizhen , Wang Ying in Beijing. Editors: John Viljoen,  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
