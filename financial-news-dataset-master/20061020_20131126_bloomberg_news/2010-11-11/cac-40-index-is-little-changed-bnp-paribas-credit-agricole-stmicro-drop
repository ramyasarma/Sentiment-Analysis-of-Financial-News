France’s  CAC 40 Index  dropped 0.5
percent to 3,867.35 at 5:41 p.m. in Paris, a second day of
losses.  The SBF 120 Index  fell 0.7 percent.  The following stocks rose or fell in the French equity
market. Company symbols are in parentheses.       Alcatel-Lucent SA  (ALU FP), France’s largest
telecommunications equipment maker, dropped 2.8 percent to 2.21
euros, a fourth retreat.  STMicroelectronics NV  (STM FP),
Europe’s largest semiconductor maker, slid 3.4 percent to 6.33
euros, the biggest drop since Aug. 27. Cisco Systems Inc., the
world’s largest maker of computer networking equipment, dropped
15 percent in U.S. trading after its profit and sales forecasts
fell short of analysts’ estimates.  Credit Agricole SA  (ACA FP) retreated 2.4 percent to 11.39
euros,  BNP Paribas SA  (BNP FP) fell 1.6 percent to 52.67 euros
and  Societe Generale SA  (GLE FP) lost 2.1 percent to 41.92
euros.  Bank shares fell for a second day across Europe as the cost
of insuring the bonds of Irish lenders soared amid concern that
the government won’t be able to afford the cost of bailing out
the nation’s banks.  Separately, Credit Agricole said profit more than doubled
in the third quarter as bad loan provisions fell and the
international retail division pared losses.       European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  (EAD FP), maker of
Airbus planes, dropped 0.5 percent to 19.01 euros. Emirates, the
biggest operator of Airbus A380s, said the engine explosion last
week on Qantas Airlines Ltd. is an “enormously big wake-up
call” to avoid another incident that would deter passengers
from the world’s largest passenger jet.  Poweo SA  (ALPWO FP), the utility whose biggest shareholder
is Verbund AG, fell 1.1 percent to 7.47 euros, extending
yesterday’s 6.7 percent slump. Natixis lowered its
recommendation on the shares to “reduce” from “neutral”
after the company said yesterday losses will be larger than
previously estimated and added that it’s studying strategic
options as a planned overhaul of France’s power market rules has
yet to take effect. The broker cut its price estimate on the
shares to 6.7 euros apiece from 10.3 euros previously.  Soitec SA  (SOI FP), whose silicon is used in chips, jumped
8.2 percent to 8.6 euros, taking this week’s advance to 18
percent.  “On the first hand, the shares may be benefitting from
speculation that it might be taken out by either” Intel Corp.
or Advanced Micro Devices Inc., said Stephane Ekolo, equity
sales trader at Newedge Group in London. “And also rumor that
it might have won some substantial big orders. On the other hand
technically the stock is in a bullish pattern and may go up to
10 or 12 euros easily.”  Soitec rose the most in almost 14 months on Nov. 8 after a
trade publication reported that Intel may opt for a
manufacturing process that uses the French company’s technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
