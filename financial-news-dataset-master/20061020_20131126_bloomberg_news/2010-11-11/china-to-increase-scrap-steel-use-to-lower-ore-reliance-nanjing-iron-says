China aims to have scrap steel
supplies of 100 million to 160 million metric tons a year by the
end of 2015 in a bid to cut reliance on iron ore as the main raw
material, said an executive at  Nanjing Iron & Steel Co.   “The government aims to reduce the use of iron ore as a
raw material and increase the proportion of scrap,” Pan Luying,
assistant chief engineer at the raw materials department in
 Nanjing Iron & Steel,  said in a speech at a Shanghai conference.  Steelmakers in China, the world’s largest producer and iron
ore importer, have been seeking to diversify raw material
sources to reduce the cost of iron ore imports. China has urged
state-owned mills to increase use of scrap, Wuhan Iron & Steel
Group said in May.  Scrap steel could eventually account for 20 percent of the
raw material used in production, said Pan. Still “it is not
always economical to use the scrap; we have to look at the scrap
prices,” he said.  China may import more than 10 million tons of scrap steel
this year, according to the China Association of Metal Scrap
Utilization.  China imported 503.3 million tons of  iron ore  in January to
October, down 2.2 percent from a year earlier, customs said
yesterday.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Richard Dobson, Jake Lloyd-Smith.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
