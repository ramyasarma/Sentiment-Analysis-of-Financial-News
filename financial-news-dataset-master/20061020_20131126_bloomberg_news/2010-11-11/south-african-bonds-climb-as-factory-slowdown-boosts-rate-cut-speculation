South African bonds rose for the
first day in five after a report showed manufacturing growth
slowed more than estimated in September, boosted speculation the
central bank will lower interest rates to revive the economy.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rose 22 cents
to 126.23 rand as of 4:25 p.m. in Johannesburg. That reduced the
yield on the bond by 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 7 percent.  Growth in  manufacturing  slowed for a third month in
September, easing to 1.4 percent from 5.3 percent in August, the
Pretoria-based statistics office said on its website today. That
was lower than the 3 percent estimate in a Bloomberg  survey .  “The data adds to the relatively bleak economic picture in
the country,”  Elna Moolman , an economist at Renaissance BJM in
Johannesburg, said in a telephone interview. “Weaker growth,
the benign inflation outlook and the strength of the rand
definitely supports the call for another rate cut.”  South Africa’s rand has rallied 36 percent against the
dollar since the start of last year, prompting calls from labor
unions and manufacturers for measures to weaken the currency
which they say is hurting export competitiveness. Even so, gains
in the rand have reduced the cost of imported oil, helping
 inflation  ease to a five-year low of 3.2 percent in September.  Monetary policy makers in Africa’s biggest economy have
lowered their benchmark rate  eight times  since December 2008 to
a record low 6 percent in an attempt to stimulate growth. The
 South African Reserve Bank  targets an inflation rate of between
3 percent and 6 percent.  Rate-Cut Bet  “The money market is almost fully pricing in another rate
cut,” said Moolman. “We’re expecting another 50 basis-point
cut at the next meeting.”  Forward-rate agreements, or FRAs, showed money-market
investors added to bets the Reserve Bank will reduce the main
interest rate when it announces its next decision on Nov. 18.
The cost of  three-month contracts for cash due in one month  fell
1.65 basis points to 5.7035 percent. The rate slid to 5.69
percent on Nov. 8, the lowest since the central bank first
introduced the repurchase rate in 1999.  The rand drifted between gains and losses before trading
little changed at 6.9070 per dollar, from a previous close of
6.9089. Against the euro, the rand appreciated 0.2 percent to
9.4741.  To contact the reporter on this story:
