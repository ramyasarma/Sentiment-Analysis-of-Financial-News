Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore’s
state investment company, bought  Bank of America Corp. ’s share
of  China Construction Bank Corp. ’s $9.2 billion rights offer,
spokesman Jeffrey Fang said.  Bank of America, Construction Bank’s largest private
shareholder, won’t participate in the offering, two people with
knowledge of the matter said, declining to be identified. Fang,
a Singapore-based spokesman for Temasek, didn’t say how much the
company’s stake in Construction Bank will increase as a result
of the transaction.  Beijing-based Construction Bank, the world’s second-largest
lender by market value,  said  on Nov. 1 it will offer existing
investors 0.7 share for every 10 held at 3.77 yuan each in
Shanghai and HK$4.38 in Hong Kong.  Bank of America owns 25.58 billion shares in Construction
Bank, or 10.95 percent, trailing only the Chinese government’s
57 percent stake, Construction Bank said last week. Temasek is
the bank’s third-biggest investor with a 5.65 percent stake.  Central Huijin Investment Co., which owns stock in
Construction Bank on behalf of the Chinese government, has
committed to participating in the rights offer.  Reuters reported earlier today that Temasek will purchase
Bank of America’s rights, citing people it didn’t identify.  -- Joyce Koh ,  Luo Jun . Editor:  Philip Lagerkranser   To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
