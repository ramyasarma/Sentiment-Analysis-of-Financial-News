Walt Disney Co. , the world’s biggest
media company, said fourth-quarter profit fell 6.7 percent,
missing analysts’ estimates, after a shift in income from cable
operators whose payments were recorded earlier in the year.  Net income shrank to $835 million, or 43 cents a share,
from $895 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Excluding
one-time items, profit fell to 45 cents, compared with 47-cent
average of 25 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Disney recorded  revenue  from pay-TV services for ESPN in
the quarter ended June 30, sooner than in 2009, resulting in a
drop in the latest period. The film studio posted a profit of
$104 million, reversing a year-ago loss, on box-office sales of
“Toy Story 3” and revenue from the “Iron Man 2” DVD.  “On the revenue side, the big miss was at the media
networks, with both broadcast and cable segments weaker than we
expected,” said  David Joyce , an analyst at Miller Tabak & Co.
in New York who recommends buying the stock. “On the operating
income side, the biggest miss was at the film studio, where we
expected more based on the strength of ‘Toy Story 3.’”  Sales fell 1.3 percent to $9.74 billion in the period ended
Oct. 2, missing the $10 billion average of 20 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Results included a
restructuring cost of $58 million, or 2 cents a share.  Disney, also the world’s biggest theme-park operator, rose
68 cents to $36.60 in extended trading. The stock dropped $1.06
to $35.93 in regular New York Stock Exchange composite  trading 
after the report was released early. Disney has advanced 11
percent this year. The company said it is investigating how the
information became available.  Cable Advertising  Revenue from cable networks, including ESPN and Disney
Channel, slid 6.2 percent to $3.13 billion because of the shift
in pay-TV revenue. Income dropped 28 percent to $1.07 billion,
also a result of the swing.  ESPN advertising sales rose 19 percent in the quarter,
Chief Financial Officer  Jay Rasulo  said on a conference call.
Fees paid by cable operators increased 9 percent in the period
and 10 percent for the year, he said. Those fees will be higher
in fiscal 2011.  Operating profit at the broadcasting division, led by the
ABC network and local TV stations, jumped to $147 million from
$2 million a year earlier. Revenue slid 7.5 percent to $1.29
billion, the company said. Adjusted for the extra week, ad sales
at Disney’s ABC stations was 26 percent higher than a year ago,
the company said.  ‘Toy Story’ DVD  “Toy Story 3” and DVD revenue from “Iron Man 2”
contributed the bulk of the film studio’s $104 million in
operating profit, compared with a $13 million loss a year ago.
“Toy Story 3,” the biggest U.S. movie of the year, has
collected $1.06 billion in worldwide box-office sales, according
to  Box Office Mojo , an industry website. Studio revenue
increased 6.4 percent to $1.59 billion.  “Toy Story 3” DVD sales will do “quite well,” Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Iger  said on the call, without
providing a specific estimate. He said 25 percent of “Toy Story
3” buyers have opted for Blu-Ray versions and of those
customers, 80 percent chose more expensive discs that come with
a digital copy of the movie, he said.  Theme-park revenue declined almost 1 percent to $2.82
billion as the company continued to reduce bargains used during
the U.S. recession to bolster attendance. Profit fell 8.1
percent to $316 million.  Attendance at U.S. theme parks fell 6 percent in the
period. Adjusted for the extra week, attendance would have risen
1 percent, Rasulo said. Advance bookings at its U.S. operations
are 5 percent higher than a year earlier, he said.  Capital Spending  The company said capital spending will rise by $1 billion
in fiscal 2011 due to theme park expansion and the addition of
new cruise ships. The company spent $2.11 billion in the year
just ended. Disney also expects retirement costs to rise by $100
million this fiscal year.  Disney’s consumer products unit increased profit 22 percent
to $184 million as sales grew 13 percent to $730 million. The
interactive unit narrowed its loss to $104 million as revenue
gained 20 percent to $188 million.  Iger said Disney is investing less in producing console
games and more in casual online video games. The company is
focused on making its interactive division profitable, he said.  “I would be disappointed if we continue to lose a
significant amount of money in those businesses, and if we do, I
would imagine we will have to redirect in some form,” Iger
said. “We don’t want to be in this business if we’re not going
to be able to make money.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
