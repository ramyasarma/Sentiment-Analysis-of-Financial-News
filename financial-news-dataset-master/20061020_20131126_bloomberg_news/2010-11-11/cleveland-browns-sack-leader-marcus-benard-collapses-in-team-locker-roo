Cleveland Browns linebacker  Marcus Benard , who leads the team in sacks, collapsed during a locker
room media interview session.  Benard was taken to a local hospital for tests and was
released tonight, the team said in a statement. He’ll undergo
further evaluation tomorrow.  Benard, 25, was sitting in a chair in the locker room at
Cleveland Browns Stadium when he fell to the floor. His eyes
were open as three members of the National Football League
team’s training staff checked on him, the Associated Press
reported.  Benard, a second-year player out of Jackson State
University in Jackson, Mississippi, leads the Browns with 4 1/2
sacks this season.  Cleveland, which is 3-5 this season, hosts the New York
Jets (6-2) on Nov. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
