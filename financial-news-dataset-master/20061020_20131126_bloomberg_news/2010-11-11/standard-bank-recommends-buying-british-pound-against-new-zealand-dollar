Investors should buy the U.K. pound
against the New Zealand dollar in the expectation it will
appreciate about 2.6 percent, according to Standard Bank Plc.  “We had previously been short” the pound when it was
trading at 2.1160 versus the kiwi, London-based  Steven Barrow ,
head of Group of 10 currency strategy, said in an e-mailed note.
Investors should initially expect an appreciaton to 2.0880,
followed by 2.1080, and exit the trade if the pound weakens to
2.0280, he said.  The pound bought 2.0574 New Zealand dollars as of 11:16
a.m. in London, down 8 percent since the end of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
