Qantas Airways Ltd. will keep its
fleet of Airbus SAS A380 planes grounded for at least another 48
hours after a mid-flight turbine explosion, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Alan Joyce.  Qantas won’t discuss compensation with engine manufacturer
Rolls-Royce Group Plc until after an investigation has been
completed, the newspaper said, citing Joyce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
