Hera SpA approved a sale of equity-
linked bonds for as much as 140 million euros, according to a

of Hera shareholders approved the bond sale and will support the
capital increase, the Italian company said. Bank of America
Merrill Lynch and Citi will be joint book-runners for the deal.  Separately Hera said its nine-month net income rose to 68.4
million euros from 42 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
