Oil and natural gas companies are
expected to raise investment in production projects to more than
$380 billion this year, partly driven by spending on drilling
for shale gas in the U.S., consultant Wood Mackenzie said.  Global upstream investment will rise about 5.3 percent, or
by $19 billion, from last year, Edinburgh-based  Wood Mackenzie 
said today in a  report . The spending will be about 10 percent
below a historical high in 2008, according to the report.  “The most spectacular recovery has been in the U.S., where
total spend should return close to peak levels by 2011,” the
consultant said. “This is primarily due to restored confidence
and an impressive renewal of activity in unconventional
resources, particularly shale gas.”  Exxon Mobil Corp. , BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and other
oil explorers have expanded unconventional oil and gas projects
in the U.S. and added expertise in shale production, which
involves drilling horizontally for thousands of feet, then
fracturing rock with injections of water, sand and chemicals.  Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. oil company, this
week agreed to buy Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion, giving it
access to the Marcellus Shale formation in Pennsylvania.  “Record growth in capital spending is already under way in
Australia, where new project approvals and major gas
developments will see capital expenditure grow three-fold by
2013,” Wood Mackenzie said.  “In Iraq, upstream investment is
likely to climb rapidly to $10 billion in the next three
years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
