Repsol YPF SA , the Spanish oil
company which supplies 45 percent of Peru’s fuel, said it’s
interested in expanding its 102,000 barrel-a-day La Pampilla oil
refinery as gasoline demand surges.  The company is weighing an expansion as demand rises to
213,000 barrels a day in 2011 from 178,000 barrels this year,
Dante Blotte, chief financial officer of the company’s refinery
and gas station business in  Peru , said in an interview. He
declined to give more information on the potential expansion.  New vehicle  imports  are set to jump by half next year as
the Peruvian  economy  expands at an expected rate of 6 percent
rate. That’s boosting demand for fuels in automobiles and the
Madrid-based company may add another 20 stations to its 262-
station chain in Peru, according to Blotte.  “Fuel supply and demand are nearly balanced in Peru,”
Blotte said yesterday in an interview in Lima. “And next year
looks just as strong, the way the economy is growing.”  La Pampilla, known as Relapasa, will sell $75 million in
debt over the next two years to restructure its short-term debt
and take advantage of falling financing costs, he said. Three-
year corporate bond interest rates fell to 3.28 percent this
year, from 5.30 percent in 2008, Blotte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
