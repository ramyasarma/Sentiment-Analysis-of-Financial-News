South Korean stocks plunged in the
last minute of  trading , as the expiration of options contracts
spurred the largest-ever sales of equities by foreign investors.  The  Kospi  index ended the day 53.12, or 2.7 percent, lower
at 1,914.73 at the 3 p.m. close, the biggest drop since May. The
gauge was at 1963.03 just before the end-of-day tumble, which
the  stock exchange  attributed in part to program selling.
Samsung Electronics Co., Asia’s biggest maker of chips, flat
screens and mobile phones, and  Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s
largest automaker, declined more than 2 percent in Seoul
trading, erasing earlier gains.  “There was a massive foreign selloff on the expiry day
that’s presumed to have dragged down the index at the last
minute of trading,” said  Im Jeong Jae , a fund manager in Seoul
at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees $28
billion of assets.  Overseas investors sold a record net 1.34 trillion won
($1.2 billion) of shares listed on the mainboard Kospi today,
Korea Exchange Inc. said. The previous record was May 7, when
foreigners sold a net 1.25 trillion won of equities, the bourse
operator said in an e-mailed statement.  A record 39.3 million options contracts on the  Kospi 200
Index  traded today, Korea Exchange said. The bourse declined to
disclose data on options that expired today. Stock markets are
often volatile on the day of expiration because of a pickup in
program trading.  Officials at the country’s Financial Supervisory Service
weren’t immediately available to comment.  Free Trade  Stocks declined today as President  Barack Obama  and his
South Korean counterpart Lee Myung Bak failed to reach agreement
on a free-trade accord.  With almost $68 billion in two-way trade between the
nations, the deal would have been the U.S.’s largest free-trade
accord since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 and
would have helped Obama meet his goal of doubling American
exports in five years.  “We decided that we need more to fine-tune details,” Lee
told reporters at a joint press conference with Obama in Seoul.  South Korea’s won advanced 0.2 percent to 1,107.61 per
dollar as of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached a six-month high of 1,102.97
on Nov. 5.  Currency Bets  South Korea’s economy grew  4.5 percent  in the third quarter
from a year earlier, slowing from a 7.2 percent pace in the
previous three-month period.  “I think some foreign investors bet that the won will
weaken after the Group of 20 nations’ summit wraps up and the
government can more freely intervene,” said  Han Joo Sung , a
derivatives analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. “That means
less foreign-exchange gains from their holdings in equities.”  The Kospi has advanced 14 percent this year, adding to its
50 percent gain last year. The gauge still trades at 10.75 times
estimated earnings, the lowest in Asia after Pakistan and
Vietnam.  Samsung Electronics  slumped 2.9 percent to 767,000 won
today, having earlier gained 1.1 percent.  Hyundai Motor  dipped
4.6 percent to 177,500 won after a 1.3 percent advance.  Hyundai
Mobis Co. , the nation’s biggest auto-parts maker declined 4.9
percent to 283,000 won.  STX Pan Ocean Co. , South Korea’s biggest bulk carrier,
retreated 6.8 percent to 13,050 won after Korea Development
Bank’s offer to sell 20.58 million  Pan Ocean  shares was
canceled, according to an official at the lender and two others
with direct knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
