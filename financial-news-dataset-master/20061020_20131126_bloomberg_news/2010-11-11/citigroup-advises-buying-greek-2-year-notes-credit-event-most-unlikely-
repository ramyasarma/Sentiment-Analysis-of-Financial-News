Citigroup Inc. advised investors to
buy Greek two-year government notes, because the nation’s
bailout means it isn’t likely to restructure its debt over the
maturity of the securities.  “Short-dated Greek bonds offer considerable protection
against further negative news at current levels,”  Steven Mansel l, a fixed-income strategist in London, wrote in a note to
investors today. “A near-term Greek credit event is most
unlikely, unless Greece is non-compliant with the terms of its
existing bailout; thus far, there is no reason to suggest that
this is about to happen.”  Investors may protect against losses on the trade by
selling five-year  Spanish securities , Mansell wrote, because
“the current risk premium priced into the mid-part of the
Spanish curve is relatively low.”  Greek two-year notes fell, sending the yield 14 basis
points higher to 11.23 percent, as of 8:15 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
