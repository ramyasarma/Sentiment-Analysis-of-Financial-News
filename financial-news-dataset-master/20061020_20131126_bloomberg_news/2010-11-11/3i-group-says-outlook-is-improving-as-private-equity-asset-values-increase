3i Group Plc, Britain’s biggest
publicly traded private equity firm, said the outlook is
improving as it posted an increase in the value of its assets.  Net asset value a share climbed to 330 pence at Sept. 30
from 286 pence a year earlier, the London-based firm said in a
statement today. 3i invested 327 million pounds ($528 million)
in the fiscal first half and reaped 293 million pounds from
selling assets.  “Market conditions and the outlook for our business have
improved compared to this time last year,” Chairman Adrian
Montague said in the statement. “However, a considerable degree
of macroeconomic uncertainty remains in many of the regions in
which we operate,” he said. “It will therefore be important to
continue to take a measured approach.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
