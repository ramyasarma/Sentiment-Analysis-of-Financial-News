Grupo Pao de Acucar , Brazil’s largest retailer, said third-
quarter profit fell 30 percent as spending on acquisitions
caused debt costs to increase.  Net income dropped to 115.1 million reais ($67 million)
from 164.6 million reais a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Pao de
Acucar  said  today in a regulatory filing. Profit missed the
120.6 million-real average of eight analyst  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Net sales rose 17 percent to 7.1 billion reais.  The retailer bought Globex Utilidades SA in 2009 to take
over the Ponto Frio electronics chain, and agreed in December to
buy Casa Bahia Comercial Ltda. A 471 million-real payment to
Globex shareholders contributed to a tripling of third-quarter
net debt from a year earlier, the company said.  Net financial expenses more than doubled to 102.1 million
reais from 47.9 million reais as net debt jumped to 1.79 billion
reais. The costs also rose after Brazilian policy makers boosted
the  Selic  benchmark overnight interest rate to 10.75 percent
from 8.75 percent a year earlier, the retailer said.  “Net financial results were much worse” than Raymond
James & Associates Inc.’s 88 million-real estimate, analysts at
the firm,  Daniela Bretthauer  and Marina Braga in Sao Paulo,
wrote in a note to clients today. That was “due to far higher
financial expenses from discounting receivables, as well as
higher interest rates in the period.”  Operating expenses increased 14 percent to 1.25 billion
reais because of spending on wages and benefits, advertising and
marketing, technology and store openings, Pao de Acucar said.
Acquisition costs, including the Globex payment, amounted to 598
million reais.  Pao de Acucar  rose 0.4 percent to 68.05 reais at 9 a.m. New
York time in Sao Paulo trading. The stock had gained 4.3 percent
this year before today,  compared with  a 4.4 percent increase in
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
