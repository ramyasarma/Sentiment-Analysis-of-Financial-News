OneWest Bank, formed in the
aftermath of IndyMac Bancorp’s failure, purchased $1.4 billion
in commercial real estate loans from  Citigroup Inc .  OneWest bought a portfolio that includes about 600
multifamily and commercial real estate loans, the Pasadena,
California-based lender said today in a statement. The loans are
on properties throughout the U.S., OneWest spokeswoman  Diane Henry  said. Terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed.  “These would have to be deeply discounted for the math to
work,” said  Walter J. Mix III , a former commissioner of the
California Department of Financial Institutions who closed 30
banks during the last banking crisis in the 1990s.  The deal will reduce loans at Citi Holdings, the division
Citigroup created in 2009 to dispose of businesses under a plan
by Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , 53, to streamline the
lender. New York-based Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by
assets and 12 percent owned by taxpayers, is liquidating
holdings after its $45 billion bailout.  OneWest is the successor to IndyMac Bancorp, which was
seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2008 at an
estimated cost of $10.7 billion. The FDIC has since used OneWest
to absorb other failed California lenders.  Last month, OneWest hired  Joseph Otting  from U.S. Bancorp
as president and chief executive officer. Otting led an
expansion in California for U.S. Bancorp, where he was head of
commercial banking and one of eight vice chairmen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
