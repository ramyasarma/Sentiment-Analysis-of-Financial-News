NYSE Arca experienced a computer
malfunction 18 minutes before trading ended today that prevented
transactions on the venue for companies such as Home Depot Inc.  The problem affected trading in securities listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex whose symbols
range from HD to  IWZ , according to an e-mailed notice.  Companies and exchange-traded funds in the U.S. all have a
primary listing venue. Because of the glitch, which began at
3:42 p.m. New York time, those securities whose home market is
NYSE Arca didn’t go through the usual auction that determines
closing prices. NYSE Arca instead used the last trade it
executed before 4 p.m. as the closing price.  “The cause of this outage was traced to an issue with
hardware” on the computer system that matches certain Arca
securities, the exchange said in the notice. “The hardware at
issue will be replaced this evening,” Arca said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
