Minnesota Vikings wide receiver
Bernard Berrian was fined $5,000 by the National Football League
for wearing yellow cleats during last week’s game, the Pioneer
Press reported on its  website .  Berrian, who had nine catches for 89 yards in the Vikings’
27-24 overtime win against Arizona, told the newspaper he won’t
wear the non-conforming cleats again. NFL rules require
Minnesota’s players to wear black- or purple-colored cleats.  NFL spokesman Randall Liu didn’t immediately return a
telephone message.  Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chad Ochocinco might face
similar discipline for wearing gold cleats during his team’s
“Monday Night Football” loss to Pittsburgh, according to NBC
Sports’  ProFootballTalk .  To contact the reporter on this story:
