Prime Plc, owner of 74 clinics and
surgeries in the U.K., lowered the price of its initial public
offering by 9.5 percent, according to terms for the sale
obtained by Bloomberg.  Managers for the deal, Evolution Securities and JPMorgan
Chase & Co., are selling the shares for 190 pence each, the
terms show. The stock had been offered for 210 pence to 250
pence apiece. The IPO will raise about 170 million pounds ($274
million) after the price cut, the terms show. Prime had
previously sought about 200 million pounds, it said in a
statement on Oct. 19.  Banks arranging the IPO will stop taking orders from
institutional investors at 4 p.m. in London today and the stock
is scheduled to start trading tomorrow, according to the terms.  Prime, whose properties were valued at 317 million pounds
as of June 30, invests and acquires health-care properties in
the U.K. including GP surgeries. It plans to use the IPO
proceeds to make further investments in current projects, fund
acquisitions and reduce debt, according to last month’s
statement.  The company is hoping to benefit from the healthcare
reorganization by Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition
government, as new policies may boost demand for new, purpose
built clinics and surgeries, Prime said in the statement.  Ocado Group Plc  was the last London IPO to cut the offering
price during its book-building process. The U.K. online grocer
and its shareholders raised 369 million pounds from a share sale
in July, after reducing the price by 10 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
