Seneca Capital, the largest single
 shareholder  in  Dynegy Inc . and an opponent of its planned $540
million takeover by  Blackstone Group LP , said it will nominate
former electricity and railroad executives to the power
producer’s board.  E. Hunter Harrison , former chief executive officer of
 Canadian National Railway Co ., and  Jeff Hunter , co-founder and
chief financial officer of closely held US Power Generating Co.,
should replace Chief Executive Officer  Bruce Williamson  and
board member David Biegler, New York-based Seneca said in a
statement today.  Seneca is seeking to replace two of the six board members
to help block Blackstone’s $4.50-a-share bid. The  purchase  is
worth $4.7 billion including assumption of debt. A shareholder
vote on the proposal is scheduled Nov. 17 at Dynegy’s
headquarters in Houston. No vote on board seats is scheduled at
that meeting.  “Seneca’s last-minute proposal to nominate two directors
is a desperate attempt to derail the Blackstone transaction
based on hopes and assumptions,”  David Byford , spokesman for
Dynegy, said in an e-mailed statement.  Dynegy rose 2 cents, to $4.52, at 10:32 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange Composite trading.  Seneca, which holds 9.3 percent of Dynegy common stock,
says the bid should be refused because the company’s value will
rebound once the economy revives demand for power from its
plants, with capacity to power about 9.8 million U.S. homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
