The U.K. will strengthen its
relations with Russia, Prime Minister  David Cameron  said today
after meeting with Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  in Seoul,
where both men travelled for the Group of 20 summit.  “It has been a very positive meeting,” Cameron said in a
statement. “I think we will have many more like this as we see
a strengthening of the British-Russian relationship which I am
keen to see.” Medvedev said the two countries have recently
“advanced on a number of issues, cooperating very closely.”  Medvedev and Cameron also met in June at the Group of Eight
summit in Canada, where the Russian president said improving
bilateral relations would require the “personal attention” of
both leaders. Medvedev said today he invited Cameron to visit
Russia next year, which the U.K. Prime Minister accepted.  Relations between the U.K. and Russia soured after Russian
authorities refused to extradite one-time KGB bodyguard  Andrei Lugovoi  over the 2006 death of former spy  Alexander Litvinenko 
in London. Britain has irked Russia by granting asylum to
billionaire  Boris Berezovsky  and other critics of the
administration in Moscow.  Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said during his visit to
Moscow last month that while serious differences between the
countries remain, progress can be made in the economic area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
