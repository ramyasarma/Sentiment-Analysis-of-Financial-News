Nigeria’s main cocoa harvest may be
extended after rains delayed development of trees, according to
the Cocoa Association of Nigeria.  The harvest that started last month may be completed in
March, two months later than normal,  Neji Abang Neji , general
secretary of the association, said by phone yesterday from
Calabar in southern Nigeria. Cocoa prices in London have dropped
1.9 percent since West African harvests started Oct. 1.  Rainfall this month in cocoa-growing regions is
“unusual,” said David Onyenweaku, an 83-year-old farmer in
Umuahia, in southeastern Nigeria. “We shouldn’t have much rain
by this time of the year.”  Cocoa is Nigeria’s second-biggest foreign-exchange earner
after crude oil, according to figures published by the Nigerian
government. Only the  Ivory Coast ,  Ghana  and Indonesia produce
more cocoa, according to the International Cocoa Organization.  The so-called light-crop, or smaller of two annual
harvests, usually begins in March and ends in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
