Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
will offer to negotiate changes to Italy’s election law with
 Gianfranco Fini  in return for continued support from his former
ally to keep the government in power, Corriere della Sera said
today, without citing anyone.  Fini is due to meet today with Northern League party head
 Umberto Bossi , whom Berlusconi has charged with negotiating a
truce after Fini threatened on Nov. 7 to pull his ministers out
of the government if Berlusconi didn’t resign. Bossi may agree
to another of Fini’s demands that the opposition Union of
Centrists party be brought into the government, the daily said.  A top Berlusconi official yesterday played down the hopes
of a negotiated settlement to the standoff and indicated that
the government is moving closer to collapse.  Gianni Letta ,
undersecretary to the prime minister, said the government isn’t
likely to last for the remaining 2 and a half years of its term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
