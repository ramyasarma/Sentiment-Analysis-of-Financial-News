The National Transportation Safety
Board said it will investigate an engine-room fire that disabled
a Carnival Corp. ship on Nov. 8, cutting short a cruise for more
than 4,400 passengers and crew to Mexico.  The board announced the investigation today in an e-mailed
statement. The agency, which recommends safety-related actions,
previously probed a 2003 boiler fire aboard a Norwegian Cruise
Line Ltd. ship in Miami that killed eight crew members and
injured 17, accoridng to the NTSB website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
