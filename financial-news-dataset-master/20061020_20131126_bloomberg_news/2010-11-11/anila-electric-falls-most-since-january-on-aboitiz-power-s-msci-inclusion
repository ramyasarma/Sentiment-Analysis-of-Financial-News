Manila Electric Co.  shares fell the
most in almost ten months on speculation investors will shift
funds to  Aboitiz Power Corp. , which is due to join the MSCI
Philippines Index.  Manila Electric , the largest Philippine power retailer,
sank 6.5 percent to 201 pesos as of 11:46 a.m. local time, set
for the steepest slump since Jan. 22 and the biggest percentage
loss in the  Philippine Stock Exchange Index .  Aboitiz Power  rose
5.3 percent to 30.6 pesos after MSCI said the company will join
the index compiler’s Philippine gauge at the close on Nov. 30.  “Manila Electric is a victim of Aboitiz Power’s addition
into the MSCI Philippines Index,” said  Alex Pomento , a Manila-
based strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd. “This revision gives
investors a cheaper alternative to play the nation’s energy
sector. It can have an impact on companies that own Manila
Electric.”  Manila Electric  is trading at 26 times reported earnings,
compared with Aboitiz Power’s 13 times. Companies in the
 Philippine Stock Exchange Index  are valued at an average 14
times profit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Metro Pacific Investments Corp. , which owns part of a
company that is Manila Electric’s biggest shareholder, sank 3.7
percent to 3.86 pesos, the sharpest decrease since Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
