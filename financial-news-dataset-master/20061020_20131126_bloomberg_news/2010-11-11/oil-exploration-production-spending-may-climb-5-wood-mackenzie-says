Oil and gas companies will increase
spending on exploration and production by more than 5 percent
this year as the outlook for commodity prices improves, Wood
Mackenzie, a consultant, said in an e-mailed report today.  Investment may exceed $380 billion, up $19 billion from
2009,  Iain Brown , the Edinburgh, U.K.-based company’s regional
upstream research manager, said in the report. Spending may
recover to a record level set in 2008 by 2012 or 2013, he said.  The global economic crisis that started in late 2008 caused
a slump in energy demand that brought oil prices from a peak
above $140 a barrel in July 2008 to below $40 by December that
year. The 2010 spending forecast is still 10 percent below the
level in 2008, Brown said.  “Confidence has returned to many regions and sectors of
the industry although this effect is far from consistent across
the world,” Brown said. “Many plans have been restored or
expanded, in the expectation that demand and commodity prices
will remain relatively robust over the longer-term.”  The U.S. showed “the most spectacular recovery,”
supported by investments in unconventional resources, in
particular shale gas, Brown said. U.S. spending may return to
peak levels by 2011, and Australia’s expenditure may grow three-
fold by 2013, he said.  Investments in Canada and Russia have had a “modest
recovery” and current plans showed spending may not return to
2008 levels until 2020, Brown said.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Jane Lee ,  Alexander Kwiatkowski .  To contact the reporter on this story:
