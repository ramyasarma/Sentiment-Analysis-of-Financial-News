OAO Transneft , Russia’s oil pipeline
operator, surged to a seven-month high in Moscow trading after
being included in MSCI Inc.’s Russia Standard Index.  Transneft’s preferred shares  rose  as much as 10 percent to
39,450 rubles, the highest intraday price since April, and were
at 38,942.34 rubles as of 11:19 a.m. on Moscow’s Micex Exchange.  The company was the only addition to the index in MSCI’s
semiannual review. The Russian state owns all of the Moscow-
based pipeline operator’s ordinary shares.  Global funds use the MSCI Index to guide their investments.
The index makes decisions on membership and weightings based on
a company’s so-called free float, or the percentage of shares
available to investors. Criteria also include the company’s
market value and the representation of its industry group and
home country in MSCI’s indexes.  MSCI Russia’s current weighting is 55 percent oil and gas,
16 percent in financials, 14 percent materials, 7 percent
telecommunications, 5 percent utilities and 3 percent consumer
staples, according to the company’s website.  MSCI didn’t remove any stocks from the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
