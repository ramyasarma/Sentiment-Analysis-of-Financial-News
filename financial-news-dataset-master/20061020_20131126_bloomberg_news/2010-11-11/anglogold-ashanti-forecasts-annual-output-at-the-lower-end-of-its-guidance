AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. , the third-
largest producer of the metal, forecast full-year production of
4.5 million ounces, at the lower end of its previous guidance
after delays and shutdowns at mines in Ghana and South Africa.  “We under-estimated some of the social complexities and
some infrastructure failures” in Ghana, Chief Executive Officer
 Mark Cutifani  said on a conference call today.  AngloGold, based in Johannesburg, had forecast on Aug. 12
that the company’s annual output would be between 4.5 million
ounces and 4.7 million ounces. Processing at the Obuasi mine in
Ghana was suspended for work on reducing water contamination,
AngloGold said in a statement on March 30.  The site, which has been mined since 1897, had “difficult
and unfortunate legacies,” while a longer-than-expected
shuttering of the company’s Savuka mine in South Africa also
reduced production, Cutifani said on the call. AngloGold won’t
provide a forecast for output in 2011 until early next year
because of the problems at Obuasi, he added.  Output at the mine declined 3 percent to 75,000 ounces in
the third-quarter, AngloGold said in a statement today.  “Obuasi has always been a difficult operation and it’s
taking longer than expected to fix,” said David Davis, a gold
analyst with Credit Suisse Standard Securities in Johannesburg.
“They’re putting a lot of money and management time into the
problem. Fundamental problems need to be solved.”  Output Gains  The company, held 12 percent by hedge-fund firm Paulson &
Co., posted net income of 443 million rand ($64 million) in the
quarter, after a loss of 1.36 billion rand in the prior three
months. South African analysts compare consecutive quarters
rather than against the same period a year earlier.  Total output rose 3 percent to 1.16 million ounces, beating
the company’s own 1.15 million-ounce guidance given on Aug. 12.
Costs increased 4.2 percent to $643 an ounce. Fourth-quarter
production is expected to be 1.14 million ounces, with total
cash costs at $640 an ounce, the company said.  AngloGold  advanced  4.2 percent to 364.50 rand by 1:43 p.m.
in Johannesburg, valuing the company at 139 billion rand.  AngloGold cut the last of its gold hedges on Oct. 7. The
company wants to take advantage of prices that are rising for a
10th straight year and eliminated its so-called forward-sales
agreements that forced it to sell the metal at lower levels.  Cost Pressure  Gold for immediate delivery jumped to a record $1,424.60 an
ounce on Nov. 9. Barrick Gold Corp., the biggest producer, spent
almost $5 billion last year ending similar hedges.  AngloGold expects gold to trade between $1,300 and $1,400
an ounce in the next 12 months, Cutifani said. The threat of a
double-dip recession and further quantitative easing “has
increased gold’s appeal as a safe haven,” the company said.  South African gold producers, seeking to maintain or expand
output, face rising costs as they dig deeper to reach reserves.
The nation has the deepest mines, extracting gold out of rock as
far as 2.4 miles (3.9 kilometers) underground. AngloGold’s South
African output rose 7 percent to 478,000 ounces in the third
quarter, while the company’s overall African production was up 1
percent to 373,000 ounces, according to the statement.  Australasian gold production rose 7 percent to 93,000
ounces and Americas output slid to 218,000 ounces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
