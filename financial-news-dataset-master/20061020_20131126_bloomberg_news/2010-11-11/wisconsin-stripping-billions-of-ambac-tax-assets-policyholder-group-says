Ambac Assurance Corp. policyholders
would be stripped of billions of dollars of net operating losses
by Wisconsin regulators in a restructuring plan that favors the
bond insurance company’s bankrupt parent, Ambac Financial Group
Inc., according to a statement yesterday.  The Ambac companies have been using about $7 billion of so-
called NOLs to reduce taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
