OOO Urals Nickel , a closely held
Russian mining company, plans to raise 700 million rubles ($23
million) in an initial public offering in Moscow in the second
half of 2011 to fund the introduction of new technology.  The company, based in Yekaterinburg, Russia, and controlled
by Dmitry Baskov, is planning a pilot project using so-called
leaching technology to produce an annual 500 metric tons of
nickel by 2013, it said in e-mailed response to questions.  Urals Nickel will later expand the operations to as much as
10,000 tons a year, the company added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
