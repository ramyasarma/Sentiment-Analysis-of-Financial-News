Turkish Industry Minister Nihat
Ergun said the government will support small and medium-sized
businesses with 3 billion liras ($2.1 billion) in financing.  Companies will be able to borrow a maximum $200,000 to grow
exports and $80,000 to grow their businesses, Ergun said at a
news conference in Ankara today. Three-quarters of interest
costs on the loans will be met by a government agency, he said.  The loans will be provided over two years with a six-month
grace period, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
