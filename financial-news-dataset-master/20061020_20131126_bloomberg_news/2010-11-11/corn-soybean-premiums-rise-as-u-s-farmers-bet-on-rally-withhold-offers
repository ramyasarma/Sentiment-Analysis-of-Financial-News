Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans this month rose as
demand increased for supplies from this year’s crop being
withheld by U.S. farmers.  “The harvest is finished, and the farmer is not a big
seller” amid expectations for higher prices, said Bryce,
Stremming, a commodity risk consultant at Mid-Co Commodities
Inc. in Bloomington, Illinois. “Spot supplies are tightening up
a bit, and there still are ships waiting to load.”  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
November rose to 47 cents to 49 cents a bushel above December
futures from 44 cents to 47 cents yesterday, government  data 
show.  Soybean  premiums increased to 45 cents to 56 cents above
January futures from 45 cents to 52 cents. Corn futures have
gained 51 percent since June 30, and soybeans are up 47 percent.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 2.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to close at $5.64 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. On Nov. 9, the price reached $6.05, the highest level for
the contract since Aug. 29, 2008.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 19.5 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $13.39 a bushel. On Nov. 9, the oilseed reached
$13.4475, the highest price for the most-active contract since
Aug. 28, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
