Kenya will start the sale of 12
billion shillings of five-year bonds tomorrow, Sterling
Investment Bank Ltd. fixed-income trader Fred Moturi said.  “It’s going to be oversubscribed because there are
expectations that rates are going up,” he said by phone from
Nairobi today. “People are dumping their bonds and then buying
new ones in the primary market hoping for a better yield.” He
didn’t know when the sale ends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
