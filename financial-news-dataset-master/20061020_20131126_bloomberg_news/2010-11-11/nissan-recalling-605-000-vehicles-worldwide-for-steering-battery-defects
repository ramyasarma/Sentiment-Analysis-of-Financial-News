Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-
largest carmaker, is recalling about 605,000 vehicles worldwide
for flaws in steering-column shafts and batteries.  The recalls include about 303,000 Frontier pickup trucks,
283,000 Xterra sport-utility vehicles and 18,500 Sentra cars,
primarily in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, the
Yokohama-based company said yesterday in a  statement .  No accidents or injuries have been reported in connection
with the defects, Nissan said in the statement. The recalls
cover certain vehicles manufactured from 2001 to 2010. About 85
percent of the vehicles were sold in the U.S., the carmaker said.  Nissan  fell  0.8 percent to 785 yen as of 9:42 a.m. in Tokyo
trading, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped
0.2 percent.  The steering-column flaw causes corrosion that can limit
the movement of the lower joint and lead to cracking of the
steering shaft, the company said. The battery defect, affecting
Sentra cars, can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or
stalling at low speeds, Nissan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
