South Africa’s Cabinet issued a
correction to an earlier statement that it will fund an
expansion of Eskom Holdings Ltd.’s power generation capacity by
selling state assets.  The earlier statement “indicated that the equity injection
of 20 billion rand to Eskom would be funded through the
liquidation of non-strategic and non-core assets,” Cabinet said
in an e-mailed statement today. “This was incorrect, as this
recommendation was not approved by the Economic Sector for
Employment and Development Cluster. The correct position is that
the 20 billion rand equity injection will be funded through the
Minister’s Committee on the Budget as part of
the budgeting process.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
