Soybeans climbed on speculation that
China will increase purchases of cheaper U.S. oilseeds in a bid
to damp inflation. Corn fell for the fourth straight day on a
forecast for increasing supplies.  China’s consumer prices in October rose 4.4 percent from a
year earlier, boosted by food costs. Soybeans on the Dalian
Commodity Exchange in China, the world’s biggest buyer, cost
about 45 percent more than in Chicago. Imports may jump to 5.2
million metric tons in November from 4.1 million tons last
month, the Ministry of Commerce said today.  “China is getting worried about inflation, and that is the
reason why they are buying soybeans,” said  Charles Sernatinger ,
a vice president for ABN Amro Clearing LLC in Chicago. “It is a
demand story.”  Soybean futures for January delivery advanced 19.5 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to close at $13.39 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. On Nov. 9, the commodity reached
$13.4475, the highest level since August 2008. The price has
gained 48 percent since the end of June, partly because adverse
weather reduced U.S. yields.  Corn futures for March delivery declined 3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $5.78 a bushel. The price has dropped 3.9 percent
this week. The grain reached a two-year high of $6.175 on
Nov. 9.  Informa Forecast  U.S. planting next year will rise to the second-highest
level since 1944, Informa Economics Inc., a Memphis, Tennessee-
based research company, said today in a report to clients.  Acreage will climb to 93.055 million from the 88.222
million that the Department of Agriculture estimated was sown in
2010, Informa said. That would mark the highest level since
2007, Informa said.  In September, Informa said farmers would sow 90.39 million
acres next year.  The increase “was definitely more than the trade had been
expecting,” Sernatinger said. “The Informa numbers pushed down
the back months” for futures as speculators unwound bets on a
rally, he said.  Production may rise 12 percent to a record 14.035 billion
bushels in 2011, Informa said.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest grower and exporter of corn
and soybeans.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion last
year, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
