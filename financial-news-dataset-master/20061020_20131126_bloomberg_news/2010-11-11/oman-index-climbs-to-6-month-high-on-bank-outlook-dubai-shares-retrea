Oman  shares  advanced to the highest
in almost six months led by  Bank Muscat SAOG  on speculation the
lender’s full-year results will beat estimates after third-
quarter profit climbed. Dubai shares retreated.  Bank Muscat,  Oman’s biggest bank by assets, rose 1.1
percent. The  MSM30  Index advanced 0.6 percent to 6,620.55, the
highest since May 16, at the 1 p.m. close in Muscat, bringing
the weekly gain to 1.6 percent.  Dubai’s index  fell 0.9 percent
as  Union Properties PJSC  slumped 4 percent after its third-
quarter loss almost tripled. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  lost
0.2 percent.  “Investors are building up positions on expectations of
improved performance of banking majors, namely Bank Muscat and
National Bank of Oman during this quarter,” said  Kanaga Sundar, 
senior manager of research at Gulf Baader Capital Markets SAOC.  Bank Muscat, the company with the  heaviest weighting  on
Oman’s gauge, increased to 0.909 rial, the highest since
September 2008. The lender will benefit from the second round of
quantitative easing, or asset purchases by the Federal Reserve,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report last week.  Bank Muscat on Oct. 14 reported a 26 percent increase in
third-quarter profit to 25.2 million rials ($65 million), helped
by higher income from lending and fees.  National Bank of Oman , the sultanate’s second-biggest by
assets, rose 1.7 percent to 0.37 rial, the highest since January
2009. Third-quarter profit jumped 16 percent to 7.09 million
rials, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude Climbs  Crude for December delivery increased as much as 0.9
percent to $88.63 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Dubai’s index fell to 1,691.65, the lowest since Oct. 5.

and resume trading on Nov. 21 to mark Islam’s Eid al-Adha
holiday. Kuwait will close from Nov. 14 to Nov. 18 and Bahrain
will shut from Nov. 16 to Nov. 18.  “Locally, investors are reluctant to take risks before a
prolonged holiday,” said  Paul Cooper,  managing director at
Sarasin-Alpen & Partners Ltd. in Dubai, which oversees more than
$500 million in the Middle East. “There is some fundamental
justification to this given some poor third-quarter results in
the United Arab Emirates.”

developer by market value, slumped the most since June 1 to 40.7
fils after its third-quarter loss widened to 451.8 million
