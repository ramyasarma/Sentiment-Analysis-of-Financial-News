General Motors Co. is recalling
13,780 Buick Lucerne and Cadillac DTS cars in the U.S. because
of a flaw that can cause power-steering fluid to leak and ignite
a fire in the engine.  The company is targeting model year 2010 and 2011 Lucerne
and DTS vehicles following reports of two fires related to
electrical arcing triggered by leaking fluid coming into contact
with the starter or alternator cable, according to a letter on
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website
today.  No injuries were reported in the fires,  Alan Adler , a
spokesman for Detroit-based GM, said in an interview.  The automaker concluded the starter and alternator cables
were incorrectly installed so they touch a power-steering line,
it said in the letter to NHTSA, the U.S. auto-safety regulator.  GM will repair the cars, which are under warranty, free of
charge to owners. The recall totals 14,245 cars worldwide, GM
said in a statement on its website.  The company this year has recalled 1.53 million cars and
trucks for a windshield-wiper flaw that may cause fires, and
303,100 Impala cars in the U.S. because seat belts in the front
seat may not be properly anchored and may fail to restrain
passengers in a crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
