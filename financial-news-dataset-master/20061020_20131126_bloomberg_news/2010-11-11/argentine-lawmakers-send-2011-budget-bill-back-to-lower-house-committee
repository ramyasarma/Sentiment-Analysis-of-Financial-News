Argentine lawmakers sent the 2011
budget bill, which includes tapping $7.5 billion in central bank
 reserves  to pay debt, back to a lower house committee after the
ruling coalition failed to get enough votes to approve it early
today.  Lawmakers voted 117 to 112 to continue discussing the bill,
which forecasts economic  growth  of 4.3 percent and inflation of
8.9 percent. The lower house may vote on the budget Nov. 17,
Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  said today.  “It’s very sad because it was a good opportunity for the
opposition to show that they don’t want to be an obstacle to the
government,”  Boudou  told reporters today in Seoul, where he’s
attending the Group of 20 summit. “We hoped to have this
approved by now.”  Opposition lawmakers have questioned the accuracy of the
inflation and growth forecasts that President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ’s government included in the bill, saying it sought
to underestimate revenue in order to be able to allocate excess
funds without congressional oversight.  “This budget is a lie,” said opposition lawmaker
 Francisco de Narvaez . “Approving this bill is lying to the
people, it’s telling them that there won’t be price increases.”  Former central bank president and current opposition
lawmaker  Alfonso Prat-Gay , who proposed changes to the bill,
said that the country would need to have a recession at some
point next year to grow just 4.3 percent, as the government’s
proposal says, after expanding about 8 percent this year.  Prat-Gay said during the floor debate that he sees consumer
prices rising 25 percent in 2011 and that the government bill
underestimates next year’s  revenue  by 37 billion pesos ($9.3
billion).  The ruling coalition, which lost its majority in the lower
house in mid-term elections last year, had wanted to pass the
bill today and send it to Senate for full approval.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 3.9595 per dollar at 12:06
p.m. New York time from 3.9615 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
