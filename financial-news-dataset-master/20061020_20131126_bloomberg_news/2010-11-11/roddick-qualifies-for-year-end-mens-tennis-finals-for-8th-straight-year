Andy Roddick  qualified for the
season-ending  ATP World Tour finals  for the eighth consecutive
year.  Roddick, the last American man to win a tennis major at the
2003 U.S. Open, made the finals by beating  Ernests Gulbis  of
Latvia in the third round of the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris
and after his main rival for the spot,  Fernando Verdasco  of
Spain, lost to France’s  Gael Monfils .  “It’s certainly an accomplishment every year,” Roddick
told a news conference in Paris. “It’s an honor to qualify
once, and then each time you kind of realize how tough it
actually is. You can’t just play well for one week. It’s the
culmination of doing it week after week on tour.”  Only the top eight players on the ATP World Tour qualify
for the season-ending tournament, which starts Nov. 21 in London
and was won by  Nikolay Davydenko  last year. The Russian, ranked
11th, didn’t qualify after struggling with a wrist injury
earlier in the season. Wimbledon finalist  Tomas Berdych  of the
Czech Republic and Spain’s  David Ferrer  also qualified today.  Top-ranked  Rafael Nadal , Grand Slam record holder  Roger Federer , third-ranked  Novak Djokovic , Australian Open finalist
 Andy Murray  and French Open runner-up  Robin Soderling  had
already secured their spots for the London finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
