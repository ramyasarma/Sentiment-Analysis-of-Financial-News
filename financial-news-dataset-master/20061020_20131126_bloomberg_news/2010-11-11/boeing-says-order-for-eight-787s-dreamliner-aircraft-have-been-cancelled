Boeing Co.  said the purchase tally
for its 787 aircraft is unchanged this week after one customer
canceled an order for eight jets and another picked it up. The
planemaker won orders for three 737s from an unidentified buyer.  The changes were listed on Chicago-based Boeing’s weekly
website update today. The company said this week that Safat,
Kuwait-based leasing company Alafco Aviation Lease KSCC would
transfer its 787 Dreamliner orders to Saudi Arabian Airlines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
