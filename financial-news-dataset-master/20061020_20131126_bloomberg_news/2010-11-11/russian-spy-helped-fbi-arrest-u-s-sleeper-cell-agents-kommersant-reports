A military intelligence colonel fled
Moscow to the U.S. in June to help the Federal Bureau of
Investigation identify members of a Russian spy ring, Kommersant
reported, citing an unidentified Russian government official.  The FBI, which had been tracking members of the sleeper
cell for years, decided to arrest the agents after the
defection, fearing Russian officials had become aware of its
surveillance operation, the Moscow-based newspaper said today.   The colonel gave the FBI a secret Russian dossier on the
senior agent in the ring, a 65-year-old general known as Juan
Lazaro, and personally accompanied FBI agents to Lazaro’s
holding cell to make the identification, Kommersant said.
Lazaro’s real name is Mikhail Vasenkov.   The U.S. exchanged Vasenkov and nine other members of the
network for four Russians convicted of spying for America in a
July 9 swap on the tarmac of Vienna’s international airport.   Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
