China’s six-month interest-rate swap
rate climbed for a third day and the yuan was set stronger on
speculation the central bank will raise borrowing costs in
coming months to curb accelerating inflation.  China will become “more aggressive” in increasing rates and
continue ordering banks to set aside more reserves, according to
Jun Ma, chief economist for Greater China at Deutsche Bank AG.
The country may allow a faster appreciation of the yuan, Ma said
in the report.  The six-month swap rate, a fixed cost for receiving the
seven-day repurchase rate, climbed three basis points to 2.38
percent. The People’s Bank of China raised the reference rate
0.31 percent to 6.6242 per dollar, the strongest level since a
peg against the dollar was scrapped in July 2005, according to
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. That was the biggest gain
since June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
