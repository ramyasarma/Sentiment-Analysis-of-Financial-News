Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said he will extend the country’s military mission in
Afghanistan to help secure gains in the country.  Canada will maintain a “smaller mission” that won’t have
a combat role and will focus on training Afghanistan’s military,
Harper told reporters today in Seoul, where he was attending a
meeting of leaders from the Group of 20 nations. Canada
currently has about 3,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, a deployment
that was scheduled to end in July 2011.  “I’m not going to kid you, down deep, my preference would
have been to see a complete end to the military mission,”
Harper said. “The facts on the ground convince me that the
Afghan military needs further training. I don’t want to risk the
gains Canadian soldiers have fought for.”  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said in Canadian
television interviews last March that she would like to see
Canada maintain a role for its military in Afghanistan that
could shift toward training and logistics.  Harper, in an  interview  with CTV earlier today, said the
country could have troops in Afghanistan until 2014 in a non-
combat role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
