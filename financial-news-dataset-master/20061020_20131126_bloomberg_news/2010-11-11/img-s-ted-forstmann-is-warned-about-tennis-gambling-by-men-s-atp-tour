The men’s tennis tour warned IMG
Worldwide Inc. leader Ted Forstmann not to violate rules against
gambling on the sport.  The ATP World Tour issued a statement after the Tennis
Integrity Unit conducted what it termed “a rigorous and
confidential process” into a $40,000 bet Forstmann placed on
Roger Federer against Rafael Nadal in the 2007 French Open
final.  “The ATP has sent the message very clearly to Mr.
Forstmann that we consider his behavior inappropriate and that
he will be in violation of the rules if he engages in such
activity in the future,” the ATP said. Forstmann’s company
represents Federer and Nadal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
