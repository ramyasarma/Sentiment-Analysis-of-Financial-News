Copper , the metal used to electrify
the world’s cars, homes and offices, will likely extend gains
from today’s record to $9,095 a metric ton, according to
technical analysis from Barclays Capital.  The metal is “only a short step away” from the
“psychologically important” $9,000 level, according to the
bank. Provided the price stays above $8,385, the metal is
expected to extend its rally to a trend line resistance of
$9,095, as the attached chart shows.  “The near-term trend is up, and we have no desire to fight
it,” analyst  Phil Roberts  wrote in a Nov. 9 report.  Copper has surged this year as the global economy recovered
from the worst recession since World War II. The metal for
delivery in three months climbed to a record $8,966 a ton today
on the London Metal Exchange. It’s up 2.9 percent this week and
21 percent this year.  China, the world’s fastest growing major economy, is on
pace to almost triple its annual use of copper to 20 million
tons in 25 years, according to CRU, a London-based metals and
mining consulting firm. That’s more than the world produces
today. Rising demand will create a potential global shortage of
11 million tons a year by 2035, CRU forecasts.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
