Cotton fell by the exchange maximum,
capping the biggest weekly slump since June, amid concern that
demand will ease in China, the world’s biggest consumer. Coffee,
cocoa and orange juice also slid.  China’s central bank may increase rates within weeks in a
bid to cool inflation, according to Bloomberg News survey. Raw
materials tumbled today on concern growth will cool in the Asian
country, the world’s biggest user of many commodities. Prices
also fell after ICE Futures U.S. lifted the margin requirement,
or amount of money traders must keep on deposit.  “Raising rates has a negative psychological impact and
will put a brake on the rising demand,” said  Keith Brown , the
president of Keith Brown & Co., a brokerage in Moultrie,
Georgia. “Also, ICE raising margin requirements is very
bearish.”  Cotton futures for March delivery declined 5 cents, the
most allowed by ICE, or 3.6 percent, to $1.3418 a pound at 12:28
p.m. in New York. The price lost 5.7 percent this week, the most
since the week ended June 4.  ICE increased margins on cotton trading on Nov. 10 after
prices and volatility surged.  Coffee, Cocoa  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery dropped 6.15
cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.0335 a pound in New York. In
London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery fell $56, or
2.9 percent, to $1,875 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for March delivery declined $87, or 3
percent, to $2,779 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures
for March delivery lost 44 pounds, or 2.4 percent, to 1,827
