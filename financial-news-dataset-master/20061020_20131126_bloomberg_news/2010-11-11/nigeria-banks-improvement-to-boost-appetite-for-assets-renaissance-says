Nigeria’s efforts to improve the
state of its banking industry through a state-owned company that
will buy their bad debts will improve foreign investors’
appetite for the country’s assets in 2011, Renaissance Capital
Economist Yvonne Mhango said.  “The equity market offers long-term value,” Johannesburg-
based Mhango said in an e-mailed report today. “Credit growth
is poised to recover from the second half of 2011 after sluggish
growth in 2010,” and the “recapitalization of the distressed
banks will underpin a recovery in credit growth.”  The West African nation’s exchange rate will remain around
150 naira per dollar as capital inflows are set to increase in
2011, boosting foreign reserves and placing the government in a
stronger position to manage the exchange rate, Mhango said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
