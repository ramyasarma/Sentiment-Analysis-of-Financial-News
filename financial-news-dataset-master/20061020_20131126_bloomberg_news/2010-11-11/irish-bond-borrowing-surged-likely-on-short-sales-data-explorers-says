Investors have doubled their
borrowing of Irish government bonds since July in a sign of
greater activity by short sellers, who bet on a security’s
decline, according to Data Explorers Ltd.  Irish government bonds on loan are close to a three-year
high, the London-based research company said in an e-mailed
statement today. The fees for lending Irish bonds have also
risen, making it more likely the bonds are being borrowed to be
sold, Data Explorers said, without providing details.  “There was a similar increase earlier this year ahead of
the Greek bailout,”  Will Duff Gordon , senior research analyst
at Data Explorers, said in the statement. “People lend and
borrow bonds to raise cash, but it is far more likely that they
would use German or U.K. bonds for this purpose.”  Ownership of Irish bonds by “large, long-term” investors
fell to 6.9 billion euros ($9.4 billion) from 10 billion euros
in April this year, Data Explorers said.  “This must reflect investor nervousness about the future
value of Irish government debt,” Gordon said.  Short sellers borrow and sell an asset, hoping to profit by
buying it back later for less. Data Explorers tracks short-sale
activity.  To contact the reporters on this story:
