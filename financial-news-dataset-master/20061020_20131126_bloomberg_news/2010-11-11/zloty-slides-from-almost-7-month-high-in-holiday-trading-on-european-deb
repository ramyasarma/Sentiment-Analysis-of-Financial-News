The zloty weakened the most among
all currencies tracked by Bloomberg as concern mounted the euro
region’s most indebted nations may need bailouts, driving
investors from riskier assets.  The zloty weakened 1 percent to 3.9349 per euro at 4:25
p.m. in London. Yesterday, the currency appreciated to 3.8761 in
intraday trading, its strongest level since April 27. Polish
markets are closed for a public holiday today.  European stocks fell, the euro weakened against the dollar
and yen and the extra yield investors demand to hold Portugal’s
and Ireland’s 10-year debt instead of German bunds jumped to
record-high levels after French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said yesterday investors must share the cost of
sovereign debt restructurings.  In Poland, “it is Independence Day today so expect zero
local liquidity and large moves on the spot, given the fact
Irish spreads are now where Greek spreads were three days before
the culmination of their crisis in May,”  Mateusz Szczurek ,
chief economist at  ING Groep NV ’s Warsaw unit, said in a report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
