Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. , India’s
largest drugmaker, said third-quarter profit more than doubled,
helped by sales of a generic version of GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s
herpes medicine Valtrex and foreign exchange gains.  Net income  rose to 3.08 billion rupees ($70 million), or
5.6 rupees a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from
1.14 billion rupees, or 2.4 rupees, a year earlier, Ranbaxy said
in a statement. Sales rose 9.8 percent to 18.84 billion rupees.  The New Delhi-based company, 64 percent-owned by Daiichi
Sankyo Co. of Japan, began selling its Valtrex copy in the U.S.
a year ago and has about a third of the market, said  Arun Sawhney , Ranbaxy’s managing director, on a conference call today.
Profit was bolstered by a gain of more than 1 billion rupees in
the value of its foreign currency bonds, Sawhney said.  Ranbaxy fell 0.3 percent to 601.85 rupees at 12:04 p.m. in
Mumbai trading. The  shares  earlier gained as much as 3.6 percent
to 624.9 rupees. The benchmark Sensex Index declined 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
