Yahoo! Inc., the largest U.S. Web
portal, said a report that it will cut 20 percent of its staff
is “misleading and inaccurate.”  “Yahoo is always evaluating expenses to align with the
company’s financial goals,” Charles Sipkins, a spokesman for
the Sunnyvale, California-based company, said in an e-mail.
“However, a 20% reduction in Yahoo’s workforce across the board
is misleading and inaccurate.”  The technology blog TechCrunch reported earlier today that
Yahoo is preparing to lay off 20 percent of its total staff,
citing two unnamed sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
