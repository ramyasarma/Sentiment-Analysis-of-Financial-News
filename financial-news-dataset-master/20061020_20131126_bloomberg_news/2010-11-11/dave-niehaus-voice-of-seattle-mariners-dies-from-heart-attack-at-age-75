Dave Niehaus , the voice of the
Seattle Mariners since 1977, died from a heart attack. He was 75
years old.  “Dave has truly been the heart and soul of this franchise
since its inception,”  Howard Lincoln , the Mariners’ chairman
and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “Since
calling  Diego Segui ’s first-pitch strike on Opening Night in the
Kingdome some 34 years ago, Dave’s voice has been the constant
with the franchise.”  During his 34 seasons with the Mariners, Niehaus missed 101
of the 5,385 games played by the Major League Baseball team.  “He was one of the great broadcast voices of our
generation,” said MLB Commissioner Bud Selig in a statement.
“Dave was a Hall of Famer in every way.”  In 2008, Niehaus received the Ford C. Frick Award and was
inducted into the broadcasters’ wing of the National Baseball
Hall of Fame.  Niehaus broadcast University of California Los Angeles
football and basketball games from 1973-76.  He is survived by his wife, Marilyn, three children and six
grandchildren.  To contact the reporter on this story:
