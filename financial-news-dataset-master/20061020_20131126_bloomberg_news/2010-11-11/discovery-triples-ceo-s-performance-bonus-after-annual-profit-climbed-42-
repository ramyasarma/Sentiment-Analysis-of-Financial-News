Discovery Holdings Ltd. , which owns
South Africa’s largest medical-insurance administrator, tripled
Chief Executive Officer  Adrian Gore ’s annual performance bonus
after company profit increased by 42 percent.  Gore, 46, was paid a total remuneration of 8.46 million
rand ($1.23 million) in the last fiscal year, which included a
basic salary of 2.3 million rand, a performance bonus of 4.67
million rand and a so-called phantom bonus plan of 924,000 rand,
according to the Johannesburg-based company’s  annual report 
received by e-mail yesterday. The previous year’s annual report
showed Gore’s salary package totaled 5.16 million rand,
including basic pay of 2.91 million rand, a performance bonus of
1.56 million rand and phantom pay of 51,000 rand.  Discovery, which Gore founded in 1992, has increased  net
income  every year for 10 years. In South Africa, which doesn’t
provide a national health-care system, many companies including
Rand Merchant Bank and Avusa Ltd. have joined Discovery’s
medical plan to provide private health care for their staff.  Discovery also offers programs linked to gyms and retailers
such as  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd.  to encourage customers to use the
insurer’s services. As the domestic market has matured,
Discovery has branched out into China, the U.K. and the U.S. to
maintain its earnings growth.  The company’s phantom bonus plan is cash-settled and linked
to Discovery’s share price, paying out two, three and five years
after allocations are made, according to the company. The
insurer’s  share price  has risen 33 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
