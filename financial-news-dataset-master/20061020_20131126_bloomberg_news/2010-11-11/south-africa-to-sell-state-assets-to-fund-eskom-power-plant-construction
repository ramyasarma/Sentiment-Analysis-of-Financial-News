South Africa’s government said it
will sell assets to fund investment of 20 billion rand ($2.9
billion) in Eskom Holdings Ltd. as it seeks to expand generating
capacity in Africa’s biggest economy.  The funding will be made available over three years
starting in the 2011-12 financial year, the Cabinet said today
in an e-mailed statement. The sales will include “non-strategic
and non-core assets” that are yet to be identified, it said.  The budget “is under pressure and we didn’t want to widen
the deficit,” government spokesman, Themba Maseko, said by
phone from Cape Town today. “We deliberated on what was
affordable and that is why we are opting for this option.”  The announcement comes two weeks after the government said
it will almost double loan guarantees for Eskom to 350 billion
rand to fund expansion, which includes construction of the
Medupi and Kusile power plants. Eskom, which supplies about 95
percent of South Africa’s electricity, is spending 485 billion
rand to prevent a repeat of five days of black outs that brought
some of the country’s biggest gold and platinum mines to a
standstill in January 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
