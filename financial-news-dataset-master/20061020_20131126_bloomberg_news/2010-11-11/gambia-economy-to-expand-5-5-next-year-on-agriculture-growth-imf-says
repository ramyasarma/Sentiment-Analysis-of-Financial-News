Gambia’s economy may expand by as
much as 6 percent this year, and 5.5 percent in 2011, the
International Monetary Fund said, citing growth in agriculture
in the West African nation.  Inflation is projected to slow to 5 percent in the “year
ahead,” the Washington-based lender said in a statement
published on its website today, following a mission to the
country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
