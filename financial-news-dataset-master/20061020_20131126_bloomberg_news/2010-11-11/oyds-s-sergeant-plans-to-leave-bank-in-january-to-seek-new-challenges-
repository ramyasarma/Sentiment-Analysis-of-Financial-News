Lloyds Banking Group Plc  said Chief
Risk Officer  Carol Sergeant  will leave the bank at the end of
January to “pursue other interests.”  Sergeant, who joined Lloyds TSB in 2004, was previously an
executive director on the board of the U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority, the London-based bank said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. She was the first risk officer to be appointed to
Lloyds TSB’s Group Executive Committee.  “She has established an outstanding risk leadership team
and has implemented industry-leading risk-management standards
and practices,” Chief Executive Officer  Eric Daniels  said in
the statement.  Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, last week named
 Antonio Horta-Osorio  as chief executive officer. Horta-Osorio,
who headed Banco Santander SA’s U.K. unit, will take over from
Daniels in March.  The bank said it will now start to search for a replacement
for Sergeant.  “Now is the right time for me to seek new challenges,”
Sergeant said in the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
