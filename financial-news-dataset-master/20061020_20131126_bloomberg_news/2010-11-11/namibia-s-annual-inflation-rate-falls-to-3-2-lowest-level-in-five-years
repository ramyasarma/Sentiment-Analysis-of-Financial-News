Namibia’s inflation rate declined to
3.2 percent in October, its  lowest level  in five years, the
Central Bureau of Statistics said.  Inflation slowed from 3.7 percent a month earlier on lower
food and clothing prices, the Windhoek-based agency said in an
e-mailed statement today. Prices fell 0.1 percent from September
with food costs declining 0.1 percent and clothing 0.5 percent,
it said.  The southern African country’s inflation has been easing
since hitting a high of 12 percent in October 2008, in line with
prices in neighboring South Africa, allowing the central bank to
cut interest rates. The bank reduced the repo rate by a quarter
of a percentage point to 6.75 percent on Oct. 20, the first
reduction in eight meetings, after cutting the rate four times
in 2009.  Price pressures are “benign” and the Bank of Namibia will
see whether there is room to cut rates further,  Ipumbu Shiimi ,
the central bank governor, said on Nov. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
