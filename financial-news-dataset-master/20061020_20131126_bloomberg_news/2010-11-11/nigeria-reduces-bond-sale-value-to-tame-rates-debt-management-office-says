Nigeria halved its November bond
sale after demand fell the month before, pushing up yields,
figures from the nation’s Debt Management Office show.  “We don’t want prices to fluctuate wildly and widely,
because that is not good for the market,”  Abraham Nwankwo ,
director-general of the Debt Management Office said in a
telephone interview from Abuja.  The agency cut the value of bonds it plans to sell to 70.3
billion naira ($467 million) from 126 billion naira originally
planned, it said in a statement on its website yesterday. Supply
of three- and seven-year bonds  exceeded demand  at October’s
auction, the first undersubscription since at least January
2008, according to data from Abuja-based office’s website.  That raised the so-called marginal rate on the 5.5 percent
note due February 2013 to 10.5 percent from 8.43 percent in
September, while the rate on the 4 percent bond due April 2015
climbed to 11 percent from 9.9 percent.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, planned to sell a
minimum of 867.5 billion naira of bonds this year to fund a
budget deficit, Nwankwo said on Feb. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
