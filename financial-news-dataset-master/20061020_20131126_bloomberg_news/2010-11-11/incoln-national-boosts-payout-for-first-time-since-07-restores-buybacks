Lincoln National Corp.  increased its
 dividend  for the first time since 2007 and said it will resume
share repurchases after paying back a $950 million U.S. bailout
in June.  The dividend of 5 cents a share, to be distributed Feb. 1
to shareholders of record on Jan. 10, compares with the
quarterly payment of 1 cent a share since early last year. The
company will buy back as much as $125 million of shares, Radnor,
Pennsylvania-based Lincoln said today in a statement.  “Our ability to take these steps reflects our strong
capital position,” Chief Executive Officer  Dennis Glass  said in
the statement.  Insurers are returning cash to shareholders as they begin
to rebound after posting losses in 2008.  Allstate Corp. , the
biggest publicly traded home and auto insurer, said this week
that it will repurchase $1 billion in shares by March 2012.
 Prudential Financial Inc. , the second-biggest U.S. life insurer,
boosted its dividend 64 percent to $1.15 a share.  Lincoln rose 13 cents to $25.00 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock was as  low  as $24.12
today before the dividend announcement. The company is  little
changed  this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
