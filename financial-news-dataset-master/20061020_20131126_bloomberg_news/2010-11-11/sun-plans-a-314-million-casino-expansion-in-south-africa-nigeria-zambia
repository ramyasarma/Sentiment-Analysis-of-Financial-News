Sun International Ltd. , the hotel
and casino operator, said it will fund a 2.16 billion rand ($314
million) expansion out of its cash resources and borrowings.  “We will fund the expenditure from existing cash flows and
bank facilities,” Chief Executive  David Coutts-Trotter  said in
a telephone interview yesterday. “The money will be spent over
a long period of time, so there are no funding issues.”  Sun International, which controls 42 percent of South
Africa’s gaming market, will spend 986 million rand on the
Boardwalk casino in Port Elizabeth, in the country’s Eastern
Cape through 2012. It will add a larger conference facility and
expand the hotel and casino, Coutts-Trotter said.  A further 450 million rand will be spent in fiscal 2011 and
2012 on refurbishing its Zambian operations in Livingstone, the
Federal Palace in Lagos and the company’s Wild Coast Sun and
Carnival City properties in South Africa, according to
Johannesburg-based Sun International’s  annual report .  The Eastern Cape Gambling Board earlier this year renewed
the Boardwalk’s operating license for a further 10 years, giving
the company the confidence to make the investment in the
upgrade, Coutts-Trotter said.  Sun International has also budgeted 684 million rand over
the next two years to replace and upgrade its casino and
information technology equipment, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
