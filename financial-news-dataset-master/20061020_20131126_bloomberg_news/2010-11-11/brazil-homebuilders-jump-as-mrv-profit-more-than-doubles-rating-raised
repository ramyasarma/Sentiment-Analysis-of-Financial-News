MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA 
gained the most since May in Sao Paulo trading, leading a rally
in Brazilian homebuilders, after third-quarter profit doubled
and Credit Suisse Group AG boosted its rating on the stock.  MRV, the country’s fourth-largest real-estate company by
revenue, jumped 6.8 percent to 16.50 reais at 3 p.m. New York
time. The company said in a filing yesterday that net income
rose 111 percent to 216 million reais ($126.8 million).  “MRV has once again displayed its top-notch execution
capabilities and robust business model,”  Marcello Milman  and
 Alexandre Queiroz , analysts at Credit Suisse in Sao Paulo, wrote
in a note to clients today. They raised their recommendation to
“outperform” from “neutral.”  Rival Brazilian real-estate companies gained, rebounding
from three days of losses sparked by concern that quickening
inflation may force the central bank to raise borrowing costs.  Gafisa SA , Brazil’s second-biggest homebuilder, jumped the
most since Oct. 13, gained 2.6 percent to 13.70 reais. The
 BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index  rose 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
