K+S AG , Europe’s biggest potash
producer, forecast a significant gain in 2011 operating profit,
driven by higher demand and prices for the crop nutrient.  Sales volumes of potash and magnesium products will
probably just exceed 7 million tons next year, up from the
expected 6.7 million tons to 6.9 million tons in 2010, Kassel-
based K+S said in a statement on its website.  K+S said demand for potash and salt topped management
 targets  in the third quarter. Farmers are replenishing nutrients
in the soil as grain prices rise and after reducing applications
of potash over the past two years. The company on Nov. 2 raised
its 2010 earnings  target  to as much as 670 million euros ($923
million) after pushing three price increases to European
customers this year.  “For 2011 too, we are confident that we will be able to
significantly raise both operating earnings and adjusted group
earnings after taxes,” Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Steiner 
said in the statement today.  The company reported net income of 76.8 million euros in
the third quarter, up from 3.7 million euros.  Potash is a water-soluble form of potassium. More than 93
percent of its world-wide production, predominantly in Russia,
Belarus and Canada, is used to make fertilizer.  The industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation and
attempted takeovers by metals miners seeking to diversify, led
by BHP Billiton Ltd.’s failed attempt to buy Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. for $39 billion. Vale SA bought about $3.8
billion of fertilizer assets from Bunge Ltd. earlier this year.  Earnings also got a lift after it became the world’s No. 1
salt producer with the purchase of Morton Salt from  Dow  Chemical
Co. a year ago. K+S also expects to sell 21 million tons of
salt, down on 2010 levels. The company booked a cost of 39.6
million euros from Morton Salt in the first nine months to
reflect depreciation of valuations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
