Qantas Airways Ltd. , Australia’s
largest airline, kept its fleet of Airbus SAS A380 planes
grounded for an eighth day as it continues checks on Rolls-Royce
Group Plc engines following a mid-flight turbine explosion.  The carrier is maintaining services by using Boeing Co.
747s on flights usually operated with A380s, it said in a
 statement  today. The Sydney-based company didn’t say when its
six superjumbos would resume flying.  Singapore Airlines Ltd.  also yesterday pulled three A380s
out of service for as long as 48 hours to replace Rolls-Royce
Trent 900 engines after finding oil stains in three units.
Airbus and the London-based engine-maker advised carriers to
check engines after a Qantas plane made an emergency landing on
Nov. 4 following the inflight blowout.  An oil fire may have caused a disc in the engine’s turbine
to fail, the  European Aviation Safety Agency  said in a  statement 
yesterday. The authority has also issued a directive for checks
on the Rolls-Royce engines, Qantas said. The carrier said it is
already complying with the advice.  Singapore Airlines is also in “full compliance,”
spokesman  Nicholas Ionides  said by phone today. The carrier
still expects its three A380s to return to service on schedule,
he said. The airline is switching engines as a precautionary
measure, it said yesterday.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the only other user of the Trent
900, yesterday said it replaced an engine on one A380.  Qantas  gained for a second day, rising 2.1 percent to
A$2.86 at 3:50 p.m. in Sydney. Singapore Air fell 0.6 percent to
S$16.02 at 12:30 p.m. midday trading break.  Rolls-Royce  fell 3.1
percent to close at 588 pence yesterday in London, bringing its
decline since Nov. 3 to 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
