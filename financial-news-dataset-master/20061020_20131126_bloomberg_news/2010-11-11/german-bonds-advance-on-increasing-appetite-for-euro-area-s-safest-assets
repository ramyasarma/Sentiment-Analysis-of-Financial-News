German 10-year bunds advanced as
investors, concerned that some so-called peripheral nations such
as Ireland will have to restructure their debt, sought refuge in
the euro-region’s safest assets.  Irish 10-year bonds tumbled yesterday, with the yield
soaring 67 basis points, driving the premium investors demand to
hold the debt instead of German bunds to a record. The
Portuguese-German spread also widened to an all-time high. LCH
Clearnet Ltd. demanded its clients place a larger deposit when
trading Irish securities. French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said yesterday investors must share the cost of
restructuring sovereign debt. Irish and Greek bonds rose today.  “Bunds are higher on safe-haven flows,” said  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings Plc
in London. “Lagarde’s comments mentioned restructuring and
that’s another nail in the coffin. There’s still a big
constituency of investors and traders who have not recognized
until now that restructuring could happen.”  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark
government security, dropped four basis points to 2.41 percent
at 7:47 a.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security maturing in
September 2020 rose 0.38, or 3.8 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,379)
face amount, to 98.64. The two-year yield fell three basis
points to 0.95 percent.  German bonds have returned 8.5 percent this year, the same
as U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Greek debt lost 18.7 percent, Portuguese bonds lost 10.6
percent, while Irish securities declined 14.3 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
