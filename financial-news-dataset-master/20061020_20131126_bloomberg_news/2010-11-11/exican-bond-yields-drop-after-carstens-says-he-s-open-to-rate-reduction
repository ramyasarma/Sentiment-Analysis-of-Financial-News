Mexico’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields down for the first time in a week, after central bank
Governor  Agustin Carstens  said he would consider cutting
interest rates to help maintain export growth should a currency
rally accelerate.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell 1
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.51 percent at 11:45
a.m. New York time, according to Banco Santander SA. The price
rose 0.1 centavo to 132.09 centavos.  “The rumor was out there for the past few days,” said
 Omar Martin del Campo , head trader at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in
Mexico City. “The scenario changes now, with the governor
saying it officially. The drop could accelerate.”  Carstens said yesterday he would consider cutting interest
rates or selling more dollar options if the Federal Reserve’s
debt-buying plan to aid the U.S. economy leads to excessive
capital inflows. He spoke in an interview at the Bloomberg
Economic Summit in Mexico City.  Mexico’s benchmark rate has been 4.5 percent since July
2009.  “We want the bank to be consistent and avoid jumping the
gun prematurely,” Carstens, 52, said in an interview after
speaking at the Bloomberg Mexico Economic Summit. If short-term
portfolio inflows intensify, “we would consider adjusting our
rates.”  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 12.2574 per U.S. dollar,
from 12.2189 yesterday. The currency has gained 6.7 percent this
year, poised for the best year of gains since at least 1972.  To contact the reporter on this story:
