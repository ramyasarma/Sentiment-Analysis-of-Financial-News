FedEx Corp. , the second-largest U.S.
package-shipping company, said it expects to handle 223.3
million items between Thanksgiving and Christmas, an 11 percent
increase from last year.  The busiest day in company history will likely be Dec. 13
when 16 million shipments are projected to move through the
system, the Memphis, Tennessee-based company said today.  FedEx said more than half of its holiday increase will be
from SmartPost shipments, whereby online retailers and customers
such as DirecTV send large quantities of lighter items to FedEx,
which then hands the goods to the U.S. Postal Service for final
delivery to residential customers.  United Parcel Service Inc.  said last month it expects a 7.5
percent gain over the holiday season, to 430 million packages in
total. UPS’s packages are mainly handled by its own employees,
making an exact comparison with FedEx’s projection difficult.  FedEx said the impact of the higher volumes was already
included in its earnings outlook provided in September. The
company forecast per-share profit of $1.15 to $1.35 for the
three months that end in November, and as much as $5.25 for the
fiscal year.  FedEx slid  23 cents to $88.25 at 1:48 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 5.8
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
