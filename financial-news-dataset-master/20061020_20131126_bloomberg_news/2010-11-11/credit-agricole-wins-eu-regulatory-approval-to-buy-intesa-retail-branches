Credit Agricole SA ’s purchase of 172
bank branches from  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  has been given approval
by the  European Commission .  “Credit Agricole presently only has a relatively limited
share of the retail banking market in Italy and the transaction
will only lead to minor overlaps,” the EU’s merger authority
said.  Credit Agricole agreed in June to buy Intesa’s majority
stake in Cassa di Risparmio della Spezia, a lender with 76
branches in the Liguria, Tuscany and Emilia Romagna regions and
96 other Intesa branches located in northern and central Italy
for about 740 million euros ($1 billion) to expand its consumer-
banking network in Italy.  The commission said there was no need for the case to be
examined by Italy’s antitrust authority.  To contact the reporters on this story:
