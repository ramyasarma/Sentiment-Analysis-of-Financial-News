Cotton’s rally will end before next
year’s harvest, and farmers should sell their 2011 supplies at
any price above 90 cents a pound, according to agricultural
economists at Texas A&M University in College Station.  “We are not expecting December 2011 to be close to or
above $1 a pound for very long given the potential we have for
increased production,”  Carl Anderson , a cotton economist and
Texas A&M professor emeritus, said today on a conference call.
“We’re going to be looking at a downward pressure.”  Cotton prices as much as doubled in the past year to a
record $1.5195 yesterday in New York on concern that demand from
China, the world’s biggest user, will erode dwindling global
stockpiles. Cotton for March delivery declined 3.19 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $1.3792 at 11:18 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.  Planting in the U.S., the largest exporter of the fiber,
will rise 21 percent in the season that began Aug. 1 to 11.04
million acres, compared with a year earlier, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said Nov. 9.  “Ninety cents is a pretty dang strong price that covers a
lot of input costs,” said  John Robinson , a professor and
extension economist at Texas A&M University. Cotton futures for
delivery in December 2011 fell 2.4 percent to 94.6 cents today
in New York.  Supply disruptions next year are unlikely to be of the same
scope as this year, when adverse weather in China, Pakistan and
Texas combined with export restrictions in India to create the
“perfect storm,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in
Mandeville, Louisiana.  World demand for cotton will total 116.82 million bales for
the season that ends July 31, down 3.3 percent from last month’s
estimate of 120.77 million, the USDA  said . The department said
China’s usage will drop to 47 million bales, 6 percent less than
the October forecast. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  “We’re going to see world demand for the use of cotton at
least stabilize,” Texas A&M’s Anderson said. “We can play
catch-up very quickly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
