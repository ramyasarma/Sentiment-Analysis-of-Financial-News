Resolution Ltd. , the insurance
buyout firm founded by  Clive Cowdery , said third-quarter revenue
rose 23 percent as sales at its European wealth-management
division more than doubled.  Revenue at the Friends Provident division was 225 million
pounds ($363 million) for the three months to Sept. 30, compared
with 183 million pounds a year earlier, the Guernsey, Channel
Islands-based company said today in a statement. Sales at
Lombard, Friends Provident’s wealth-management unit, climbed
176 percent to 78.2 million pounds.  “The Lombard business has benefitted throughout the year
from the improving market conditions and returning client
confidence across a number of its markets,” Resolution said in
the statement.  Resolution last month agreed to buy Bupa Health Assurance
Ltd., its third acquisition in the U.K. life-insurance market
since its initial public offering in December 2008. The firm,
which also owns Friends Provident and Axa SA’s U.K. life-
insurance unit, plans to build a life insurer worth about
10 billion pounds in the next two years.  Resolution shares rose 0.6 percent to 248 pence as of
8:05 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
