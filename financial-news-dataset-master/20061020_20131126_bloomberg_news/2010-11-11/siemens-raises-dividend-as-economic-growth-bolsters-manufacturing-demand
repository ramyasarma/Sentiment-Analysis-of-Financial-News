Siemens AG  said customers for long-
cycle industrial products are considering investments again, and
that the recovery in short-cycle demand has extended into the
first quarter of its fiscal year.  Siemens, based in Munich, continues to review the portfolio
of its industrial unit, Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’
industry division, said during an event at Red Bull Racing’s
factory in Milton Keynes, where he presented software that’s
used to tweak the handling of Formula 1 cars.  Siemens’s industry division, its biggest by sales,
accelerated cost cuts, reduced investment and steered its focus
toward emerging markets to weather a slump in spending on
machinery. The division last year eliminated 16,000 posts and
reduced sales and administrative costs by 750 million euros in
one year, exceeding a 600 million-euro goal set for two years.  The German company competes with Royal Philips Electronics
N.V. and  General Electric Co . in the light-bulb market, with  ABB
Ltd . in automation, and Alstom SA and  Bombardier Inc . in the
train market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
