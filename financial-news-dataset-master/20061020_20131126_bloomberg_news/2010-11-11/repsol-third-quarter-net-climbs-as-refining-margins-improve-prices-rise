Repsol YPF SA , Spain’s biggest oil
company, said third-quarter profit rose 70 percent after
refining margins improved and crude prices increased.  Profit  adjusted to exclude inventories and one-time items
climbed to 502 million euros ($693 million) from 296 million
euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company said today in a
regulatory filing.  Repsol is investing in exploration in  Brazil ’s offshore
Santos Basin and elsewhere to increase output, while seeking to
reduce exposure to mature fields in  Argentina . Its refining
margins are now improving after demand fell last year with the
global economic slump.  “The greater refining margin was motivated by the widening
of the differentials of light and heavy crudes as well as middle
distillates, and by the recovery of the chemical business,”
Repsol said in a statement.  Besides exploration, Repsol is also spending to improve
refining margins and new units at its Spanish refineries in
Bilbao and Cartagena will start operating at the end of 2011.  The refining margin indicator for Spain, a measurement of
the profit from turning crude into fuels, widened to $1.50 a
barrel in the third quarter from $0.30 a barrel a year earlier,
Repsol said today.  Profit from turning crude into fuel rose about 33 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier, to $4.53 a barrel from
$3.41, according to BP’s Global Indicator Margin. Oil futures
averaged $76.21 a barrel in the third quarter, a 12 percent
increase from a year earlier, and natural-gas futures rose 23
percent.  Production Growth  Repsol on April 29 said it forecasts annual production
growth of as much as 4 percent through 2014 as projects in
Brazil and Peru come on stream. The company plans to invest 28.5
billion euros in the period.  It will develop the Guara and Piracuca fields in Brazil,
Kinteroni in Peru, Margarita-Huacaya in Bolivia,  Cardon IV  in
Venezuela and Reggane in Algeria, according to that plan. The
company has estimated a reserve replacement ratio of more than
110 percent in the next five years after reaching 94 percent in
2009.  China Petrochemical Corp. , China’s second-largest oil and
gas producer, will invest $7.1 billion in  Repsol ’s Brazilian
unit as the Spanish oil company raises funds to develop offshore
projects. Sinopec Group, as the company is known, will buy new
shares in the Brazilian unit and will hold 40 percent of that
division after the capital increase, Repsol said Oct. 1.  Santos Basin  Repsol has stakes in blocks in Brazil’s Santos, Campos and
Espirito Santo basins and has said it will invest as much as $5
billion there from 2010 through 2014, and as much as $9 billion
from 2015 through 2019.  Since 2007, Repsol and partners  BG Group Plc  and  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA  have found hydrocarbons in the offshore Carioca,
Guara and Iguacu fields in the Santos Basin’s BM-S-9 block.
These are ultra-deep deposits beneath a salt layer under the
seabed.  Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil company is
known, estimated in November 2007 that the Santos Basin’s pre-
salt Tupi field may have as many as 8 billion barrels of oil,
the largest find in the Americas since Mexico’s Cantarell field
in 1976. Repsol doesn’t own a stake in Tupi.  Oil and gas production at Repsol’s upstream division, which
doesn’t include Argentine unit YPF, rose 5.8 percent from a year
earlier to 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the third
quarter. Output from Buenos Aires-based YPF, of which Repsol
owns 84 percent, fell 2.7 percent to 551,000 barrels a day as
mature fields declined.  YPF Sale  The Spanish company wants to sell part of its holding in
YPF “sooner rather than later,” Repsol Chief Executive Officer
 Antonio Brufau  said on April 29. The shares may be sold to
institutions or in the stock market and Repsol will keep at
least 51 percent of YPF, he said. In 2008 Repsol delayed a
public offering of a stake in YPF.  Repsol  may raise about $3 billion from the sale of a 20
percent stake in YPF through a stock offering in Buenos Aires
and New York, Argentine investor  Sebastian Eskenazi  said May 19.
Eskenazi, whose family bought 15 percent of YPF from Repsol for
$2.2 billion in December 2007, expects to exercise an option to
boost the stake to 25 percent by 2012 this year.  The Spanish oil company’s shares have climbed 5.5 percent
in Madrid this year, valuing the company at 24 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
