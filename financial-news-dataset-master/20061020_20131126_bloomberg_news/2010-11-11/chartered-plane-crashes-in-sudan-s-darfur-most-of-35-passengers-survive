Most passengers survived when a
chartered plane carrying about 35 people crashed in Sudan’s
western region of Darfur today, according to the country’s Civil
Aviation Authority.  The aircraft, chartered by a local company called Tabco,
crashed as it was landing at a dirt airstrip in the town of
Zalengi in West Darfur state, Abdel Hafiz Abdel Rahim, the
agency’s spokesman, said in a phone interview from the capital,
Khartoum.  “The plane exploded when it landed,” Abdel Rahim said.
About six passengers were injured and it was unclear whether any
were killed as some were still missing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
