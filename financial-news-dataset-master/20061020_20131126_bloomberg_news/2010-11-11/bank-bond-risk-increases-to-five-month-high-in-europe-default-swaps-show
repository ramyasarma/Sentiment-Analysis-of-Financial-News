The cost of insuring against losses
on European bank bonds rose to the highest level in five months,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to
the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers climbed 5 basis points
to 148.5, the highest since July 7, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co. at 8:30 a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the
cost of protecting bonds against default and an increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings increased 2.25 basis points to 105.25,
the highest in five weeks, JPMorgan prices show. The Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings jumped 9 basis points to 462.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
