Emirates Telecommunications
Corp.  said it will borrow as much as $8 billion by issuing bonds
and sukuk as the United Arab Emirates’ largest phone company
bids for a 46 percent stake in its Kuwaiti rival.  Etisalat, as the company is known, set up a $7 billion
medium-term note program and a $1 billion Islamic bond program,
it said in an e-mailed statement today. Etisalat has offered
about $12 billion for the stake in Mobile Telecommunications
Co., known as Zain.  The bond programs will allow the company to diversify its
funding and manage debt maturities, Etisalat said. The Abu
Dhabi-based company is seeking more than $9 billion of bank
loans to fund its offer for Zain, three bankers familiar with
the deal said Oct. 13.  The deal would be the largest acquisition financing by a
company in the Middle East and Africa since at least 1999,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Zain transaction represents a large, potentially
highly levered acquisition that could increase the
company’s risk profile and leverage,” Moody’s Investors Service
said today as it put Etisalat’s Aa3 ratings on review for
possible downgrade.  Etisalat is rated AA- by Standard & Poor’s and a step lower
at A+ by Fitch Ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
