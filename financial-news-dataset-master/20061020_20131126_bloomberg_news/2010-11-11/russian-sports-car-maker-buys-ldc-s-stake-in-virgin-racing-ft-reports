Russian sports carmaker Marussia
Motors acquired a stake in rookie Formula One team Virgin Racing
from Lloyds Banking Group’s private equity arm.  The investment secures the “long-term future” of the
U.K.-based squad, Virgin Racing said in an e-mailed statement,
without giving financial details. Lloyds unit,  LDC, said on its
website  it’s getting an “attractive return” on an investment
the Financial Times last year put at about 10 million pounds
($16.1 million).  “This announcement cements our place on the Formula One
grid,” Virgin Racing Chief Executive Officer  Graeme Lowdon  said
in the statement, adding the carmaker is becoming a
“significant” shareholder in the team.  LDC said it will retain a stake in the team, which like the
two other new groups hasn’t scored a point after 18 races. The
season-ending race is Nov. 14 in Abu Dhabi.  Moscow-based Marussia , founded in 2007, joins other team
backers including billionaire  Richard Branson ’s  Virgin Group
Ltd . Russia will host a Formula One race in the Black Sea resort
of Sochi from 2014 under a deal signed last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
