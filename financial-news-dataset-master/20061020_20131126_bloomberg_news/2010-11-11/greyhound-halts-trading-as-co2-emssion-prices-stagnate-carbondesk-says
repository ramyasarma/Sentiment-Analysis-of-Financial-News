Greyhound Energy Markets Ltd. has
stopped operations and is “on hold” while the European Union
carbon market is “stuck in a band,” according to Greyhound
shareholder  CarbonDesk Group Plc .  CarbonDesk, a London-based emission-permit broker and
investor, announced in March its purchase of a 33 percent
interest in Greyhound to trade in energy and carbon markets.  “It didn’t really work,”  Brett Stacey , chief executive
officer of London-based CarbonDesk, said today in a phone
interview. “We didn’t lose money. We weren’t making money. We
decided to call it a day.”  Greyhound’s  Jerry Vlam  and  Simon Gadd  have stopped trading
for the venture, Stacey said. Benchmark carbon prices have
stayed in a range of 13.53 euros to 16.52 euros ($18.54-$22.64)
a metric ton in the past seven months, according to data from
ICE Futures Europe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
