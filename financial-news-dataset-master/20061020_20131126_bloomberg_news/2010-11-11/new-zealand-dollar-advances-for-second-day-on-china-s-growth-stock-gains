The Australian dollar fell to the
lowest level against the dollar in a week after a government
report showed the nation’s unemployment rate unexpectedly
increased in October.  The New Zealand dollar fell as stocks declined, damping
demand for assets related to economic growth.  “When you get that many people searching for jobs and
there’s only limited supply, what happens is the unemployment
rate increases,” said  Richard Grace , chief currency strategist
at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. “You might see a
bit of selling involved, but I don’t think this is a game
changer for the Australian dollar.”  The Australian currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 99.79
U.S. cents at 10:56 a.m. in New York, from $1.0053 yesterday,
after earlier falling as much as 0.9 percent to 99.67 U.S.
cents, the lowest level since Nov. 3. The kiwi dollar fell 0.3
percent to 78.02 U.S. cents, from 78.29 cents.  The jobless rate of Australia rose to 5.4 percent last
month from 5.1 percent in the previous month, the statistics
bureau said in Sydney. The median forecast of 24 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a drop to 5 percent.  U.S. stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
declining 0.8 percent. Crude oil futures touched the two-year
high of $88.63 a barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
