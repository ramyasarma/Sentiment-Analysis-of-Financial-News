India’s 12-year  bonds  fell for a
second day on speculation banks will sell debt to replenish cash
as share sales by the nation’s companies drain funds from the
financial system.  Yields on the most-traded notes due 2022 climbed to the
highest level in almost two weeks after local lenders borrowed a
record  1.2 trillion rupees  ($27 billion) from the central bank.
State-owned  Power Grid  Corp. of India and the government plan to
raise a combined 75.8 billion rupees in the company’s share
offering that opened Nov. 9. Coal India Ltd. raised 152 billion
rupees last month in the nation’s biggest initial share sale.  “The ongoing liquidity tightness is a bit worse than most
people expected and it may persist for a while,” said  Navneet Munot , who oversees $8.5 billion as chief investment officer at
Mumbai-based SBI Funds Management Pvt., a unit of India’s
biggest lender. That’s “holding investors back” in the bond
market, he said.  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022 rose
two basis points to 8.06 percent, the highest since Nov. 1, as
of 10:01 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The price fell 0.13, or 13 paise per 100 rupee face
amount, to 100.53.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, climbed four basis points to 6.78 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
