China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd.,
which operates farms and produces raw milk, may raise as much
as HK$4.43 billion ($571 million) in a Hong Kong initial public
offering, a sales document shows.  The company is offering 1.2 billion shares at HK$2.89 to
HK$3.69 each, according to the terms for the sale, which is
being managed by  Citigroup Inc.  and  UBS AG . New shares account
for 67 percent of the stock on offer and 33 percent is existing
equity, the term sheet shows. Modern Dairy plans to set the
price for its shares on Nov. 20 and start trading on Nov. 26.  Two of the three Chinese dairy companies collectively
seeking $1.1 billion in IPOs this quarter declined in trading
following their share sales as skepticism lingered two years
after a poisoned-milk scandal. About 300,000 children in the
nation were sickened by melamine-tainted milk two years ago,
prompting 190 million yuan ($29 million) in government
subsidies to dairy companies in an effort to bolster the
industry.  “No parents would risk their children’s life, unless they
have insufficient income to buy imported milk powder,” said
 Jason Yuan , an analyst with UOB Kay-Hian Ltd. in Shanghai.  Global Dairy Holdings Ltd.  fell 10 percent on the first
day of trading following an initial offering that raised $204
million, and  Yashili International Holdings Ltd.  lost 12
percent after its IPO raised $349 million. Of 63 companies that
listed in Hong Kong this year, only three had debuts worse than
the two dairies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  GIC, Mengniu  Five investors, including the  Government of Singapore
Investment Corp.  and China Mengniu Dairy Company Ltd. will buy
$130 million worth of Modern Dairy shares, according to the
document.  Jennifer Lewis , a spokeswoman for Singapore’s GIC,
confirmed in an e-mail that it’s one of the investors. Mengniu
spokeswoman  Zhao Yuanhua  didn’t answer calls to her mobile
phone.  Modern Dairy has an option to sell an additional 180
million shares after the stock lists, according to the sale
document. The stock sale would add to the record $46 billion
raised through 64 initial offerings in Hong Kong this year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
