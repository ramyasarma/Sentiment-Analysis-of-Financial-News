China’s decision to raise lenders’
reserve requirements will “pressure” the nation’s stock
markets in the short term, according to Lion Fund Management Co.  The central bank has “showed its resolve” in tackling
rising inflationary expectations, the company said in an e-mail.
Stocks will rally in the longer term, driven by the continued
improvement in the economy, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
