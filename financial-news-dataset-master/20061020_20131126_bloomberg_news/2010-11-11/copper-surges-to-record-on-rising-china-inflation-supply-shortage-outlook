Copper rose to a 30-month high in
New York and touched a record in London as reports showed higher
factory output and stronger inflation in China, the world’s
biggest consumer of the metal.  Industrial production  advanced 13.1 percent in October from
a year earlier, and retail sales gained 18.6 percent, China’s
government said. Inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in
two years, stoking demand for commodities as a hedge against
rising prices. China also reported a drop in its copper output.  The Chinese economic data is “suggestive of continued
strong growth in metals demand,” said  Gayle Berry , an analyst
at Barclays Capital in London.  Copper futures for December delivery added 5.35 cents, or
1.3 percent, to close at $4.0225 a pound at 1:24 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, prices touched $4.0835, the highest
level since May 5, 2008, when the most-active contract reached a
record $4.2605.  “Demand from China, India and emerging Asian countries is
going to drive prices higher,” said Lannie Cohen, the president
of  Capitol Commodity Services Inc.  in Indianapolis. Copper will
reach its old high by the end of the year and climb to $5.08 in
2011, he said.  London Record  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery advanced $70, or 0.8 percent, to $8,830 a metric ton
($4.01 a pound), after touching $8,966, surpassing the previous
peak of $8,940 set in July 2008.  Copper will rise to $11,250 next year, according to Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch.  “Heavily driven by continued tight mine supplies, copper
has the strongest structural fundamentals among the base
metals,”  Jason Fairclough , an analyst at Bank of America-
Merrill Lynch, said in a report. The planned introduction of
exchange-traded funds “should add to upward pressure on
prices,” he said.  Copper  stockpiles  in LME warehouses have shrunk 28 percent
this year, on course for the first annual decline since 2004.
Inventories were 362,950 tons today, the lowest level since
October 2009.  Production of the metal in China declined 1.2 percent to
400,000 tons in October from a month ago, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics.  Aluminum, lead, zinc and tin also gained in London. Nickel
fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
