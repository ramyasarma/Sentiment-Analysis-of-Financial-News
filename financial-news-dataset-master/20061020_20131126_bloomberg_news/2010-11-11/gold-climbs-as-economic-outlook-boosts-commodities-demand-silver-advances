Gold gained in New York as European
debt concerns spurred demand for a protection of wealth and as
faster inflation in China boosted demand for commodities.  Gold futures climbed to a record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov.
9 on concern that some European governments may struggle to
raise funds. Portuguese and Spanish government bonds declined on
mounting concern that nations on Europe’s periphery will be
forced to restructure their debt. All six main industrial metals
on the London Metal Exchange gained after China’s inflation
reached a two-year high.  “The re-emergence of sovereign risk should ultimately help
the yellow metal,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in London,
said in a report. “Rising inflation is one of the single
biggest factors driving China’s appetite for gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery added $8.70, or 0.6
percent, to $1,408 an ounce at 8 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
The metal for immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent
higher at $1,408.15. It reached a record $1,424.60 on Nov. 9.  Bullion rose to $1,413 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,390.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Bullion priced in
euros and Swiss francs rose to the highest level since June, and
reached the highest price since 1983 in Japanese yen.  Gold is up 28 percent this year and is heading for a 10th
annual gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in
London, partly on demand for an alternative asset to protect
against the debasement of currencies. Governments have spent
trillions of dollars to bolster their economies. Last week, the
Fed said it will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries
through June.  Rising Inflation  Inflation in China, the largest consumer of raw materials
from copper to soybeans, accelerated to the fastest pace in two
years in October. Copper reached a record in London today. Some
investors buy commodities to hedge against rising consumer
prices.  “Some say there’s a bubble in gold prices or the metal is
overbought, but the bull run does not seem to be receding,”
said Lee Joon, a senior trader at Woori Futures Co. in Seoul.
“Investors are rushing to risky assets like stocks and
commodities with ample market liquidity.”  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell 0.6 metric ton
to 2,088.08 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14. Silver assets climbed 354.4 tons to 14,741.7
tons yesterday, the most since at least February, data from four
providers show.  Silver Gains  Rising silver holdings indicate “the scale of pent-up
demand for precious metals as investors remain concerned about
longer-term inflation,”  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in a report.  Silver for December delivery in New York added 1.8 percent
to $27.35 an ounce. It reached $29.34 on Nov. 9, the highest
price since March 1980, and is up 62 percent this year. Silver
reached an all-time high of $50.35 in New York in 1980, a year
after the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market.  Purchases of American Eagle silver coins from the U.S. Mint
so far this month are 1.59 million ounces,  data  on its website
show. That compares with 3.15 million ounces sold throughout
October, the most since May.  Palladium for December delivery rose 2.9 percent to $717.20
an ounce and reached a nine-year high of $743.50 on Nov. 9. It’s
up 75 percent this year. Platinum for January delivery gained
1.2 percent to $1,758.10 an ounce. Prices reached $1,811.80 on
Nov. 9, the highest level since July 2008.  Both metals are used mostly to make jewelry and pollution-
control devices for cars. Passenger-car sales in China, the
world’s biggest auto market, rose at the fastest pace in six
months in October as government incentives for fuel-efficient
cars boosted buying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
