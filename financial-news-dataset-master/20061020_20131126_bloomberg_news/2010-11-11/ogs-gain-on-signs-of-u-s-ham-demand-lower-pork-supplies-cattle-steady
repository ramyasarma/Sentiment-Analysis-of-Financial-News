Hog futures rose to a two-week high
weeks on signs of increasing U.S. ham demand and lower pork
supplies. Cattle were little changed.  Hog carcasses  averaged 206.7 pounds (93.7 kilograms) on
Nov. 9, down 1.5 percent since Oct. 29, when weights were the
heaviest since at least 2002, according to U.S. Department of
Agriculture data. Lighter animals yield less meat. The  price  of
hogs for immediate delivery rose 2 percent yesterday to 60.83
cents a pound, a two-week high.  “We’ll start to see some seasonal strength in the ham
market for the holiday season,” said  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “The weights
are starting to taper off,” and higher cash prices are
supporting futures, he said.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.775 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 69.025 cents a pound at 9:54 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 69.675 cents,
the highest level for a most-active contract since Oct. 25.
Before today, the commodity gained 23 percent in the past year.  Cattle futures for February delivery were little changed at
$1.0295 a pound. Before today, the price gained 20 percent in
2010.  Yesterday,  wholesale choice beef  fell 0.6 percent to
$1.5735 a pound, the lowest level since Oct. 18. The price has
dropped 8.2 percent from this year’s high of $1.714 on May 11.  “The boxed beef is disappointing,” Roose said.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement were little
changed at $1.149 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
