Chile’s lower house of congress
approved, in general terms, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain’s
proposed 5.5 percent public spending increase next year.  Lawmakers approved the  overall budget bill  today by a vote
of 83 to 10, with two abstentions. Lower house voting on
individual articles in the bill is scheduled for later today,
before the proposal goes to the Senate.  The proposed budget aims to increase public spending on
reconstruction after a February earthquake and on social service
programs,  Larrain  said in today’s discussion in Valparaiso. The
government wants to lift public spending by a rate that doesn’t
exceed the pace of economic expansion in order to help prevent
the peso from appreciating further, he said.  “We want to make the central bank’s job easier in
controlling inflation,” Larrain said. “We didn’t want a more
expansive fiscal policy that would cause inflation and interest
rates to rise, which in turn would depress the exchange rate.”  Chile’s economy will grow 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent next
year, the central bank said in its latest monetary policy
report, published in September. Chile’s peso has gained 6.7
percent against the U.S. dollar in the last three months, the
most among seven major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
