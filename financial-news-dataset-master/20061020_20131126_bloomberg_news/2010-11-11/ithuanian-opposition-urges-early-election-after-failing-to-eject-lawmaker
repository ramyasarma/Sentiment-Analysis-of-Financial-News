Lithuanian opposition parties urged
parliament to dissolve itself and call early elections after a
failed vote to eject a lawmaker today.  Parliament fell short of removing Aleksandr Sacharuk,
ignoring the Constitutional Court’s ruling that he breached the
Constitution when he voted in place of an absent colleague.  Early elections should be held along with voting for
municipal offices scheduled for February, said Loreta
Grauziniene, a member of the opposition Labor Party, according
to a broadcast of the parliament session.  Algirdas Butkevicius ,
the head of the opposition Social Democrat Party, also backed
early elections,  delfi.lt  reported today.  “This is the darkest day in Lithuania’s parliamentary
history,” Egidijus Kuris, a former Constitutional Court chief
justice, said on LRT television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
