The dollar may rise to a level
against the yen last reached in September should it stay above a
critical trend line, according to Societe Generale SA.  The U.S. currency broke yesterday above the trend line
connecting highs reached May 5, June 4 and Sept. 16-17, and
doing so again today and tomorrow may indicate a move toward its
100-day moving average of 84.66 yen, said  Carl Forcheski , a
director on the corporate currency sales desk at Societe
Generale SA in New York, in a telephone interview. The dollar
last traded at that level on Sept. 24.  The dollar fell 3.8 percent against the yen in October and
dropped 0.8 percent in September on speculation increased debt
purchases by the Federal Reserve under quantitative easing would
debase the greenback.  “The Fed’s quantitative easing was largely discounted in
the move from the middle of September through the end of
September,” Forcheski said. “The dollar’s adjustment downward
was occurring. This could be some general dollar correction.”  The greenback has appreciated 1.7 percent against its
Japanese counterpart since Nov. 3, when the Fed announced an
additional $600 billion in debt purchases through June.  The dollar gained 0.2 percent to 82.46 yen at 10:03 a.m. in
New York, from 82.28 yesterday, when it touched 82.80 yesterday,
the highest level since Oct. 7.  The U.S. currency needs to rise above a range of 82.50 to
83.25 yen today and tomorrow to break through the trend line,
according to Forcheski.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
