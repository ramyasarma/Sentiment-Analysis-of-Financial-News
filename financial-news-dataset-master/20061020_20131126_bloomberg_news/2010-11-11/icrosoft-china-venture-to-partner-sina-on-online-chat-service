Microsoft Corp. ’s Internet venture
in China and  Sina Corp. , owner of the country’s third-most-
visited web portal, will offer services including instant
messaging, challenging industry leader  Tencent Holdings Ltd.   Shanghai MSN Network Communications Technology Co., 50
percent-owned by Microsoft, will collaborate with Sina on blogs,
mini-blogs, mobile-phone content, and instant messaging,
according to a joint statement by the companies today.  Microsoft is strengthening ties with Chinese online
companies to expand in the world’s biggest Internet market by
subscribers.  Tencent , the biggest local Internet company,
yesterday said a dispute that’s affected users of its market-
leading QQ instant-messaging service has yet to be resolved.  QQ accounted for 77 percent of China’s instant-messaging
market at the end of last year, compared with 4.2 percent for
Microsoft’s MSN, according to research company Analysys
International.  The website of Sina, based in Shanghai, ranks behind only
 Baidu Inc. , China’s biggest search-engine, and Tencent’s QQ.com
in user traffic in China, according to China Websites Ranking, a
site run by the Internet Society of China that compiles Web
traffic information.  As many as 3 percent of QQ’s subscribers may be affected by
Tencent’s Nov. 3 decision to stop support for computers with
software made by 360.cn, a Chinese security software company,
according to estimates by Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. analyst
 Muzhi Li  last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
