China’s new local-currency lending
was a more-than-estimated 587.7 billion yuan last month, a
report from the central bank showed today.  The number posted on the central bank’s website compared
with the median 450 billion yuan forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 25 economists.  M2, the broadest measure of money supply, rose 19.3 percent
in October from a year earlier, the central bank said. That
compared with economists’ 19 percent median estimate.   To contact the reporter on this story:
