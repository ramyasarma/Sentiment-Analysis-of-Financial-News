The difference between  yields  on 10-
year gilts and index-linked securities may widen as U.K.
inflation persistently exceeds the Bank of England’s 2 percent
target, Barclays Plc said.  “The market appears to be only modestly pricing in upside
risks to inflation from easy monetary policy,” London-based
analysts  Moyeen Islam  and  Henry Skeoch  wrote in a note to
investors dated yesterday. “Now may be the time to consider
acquiring inflation protection, given the macroeconomic
uncertainty.”  The 10-year break-even rate, a measure of consumer-price
expectations based on the difference between yields on
inflation-linked bonds and conventional securities, was little
changed at 2.91 percentage points as of 9:11 a.m. in London. It
reached 2.92 percentage points yesterday, the most since July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
