Roy Lichtenstein’s 1964 painting
“Ohhh...Alright...” sold for a record $42.6 million tonight at
Christie’s International in New York, soaring past his previous
auction peak of $16.3 million and topping the presale estimate
of $40 million.  The late Pop artist’s comic-strip-inspired rendering of a
pouty redhead, once owned by actor and art collector Steve
Martin, was sold by casino magnate Steve Wynn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
