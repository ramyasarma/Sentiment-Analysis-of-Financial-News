DLF Ltd ., India’s biggest developer,
fell the most in more than a week in Mumbai trading after
second-quarter profit lagged behind analyst estimates.  DLF slid 1.6 percent to 357 rupees at 9:27 a.m. in Mumbai,
the most since Nov. 2. The stock declined 1.2 percent this year,
compared with a 20 percent gain in the benchmark stock index.
The earnings were released after the close.  Net income  dropped 4.5 percent to 4.2 billion rupees ($95
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30, from 4.4 billion
rupees a year earlier, the New Delhi-based developer said
yesterday. That’s lower than the 4.38 billion rupee  average 
forecast of 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Despite increase in lease rental income and improved
pricing, a considerable drop in margins came in as a negative
surprise,” Mumbai-based analyst  Prem Khurana  at B&K Securities
India Pvt. said in a note to clients after the earnings.  Margins  for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization slid 13 percent in the quarter from a year
earlier, B&K said in the note.  Sales rose 35 percent to 23.7 billion rupees from a year
earlier, the company said, while the cost of land and
development rights more than doubled to 8.1 billion rupees, and
finance charges climbed 74 percent to 4.3 billion rupees in the
quarter from a year earlier.  The central bank, which raised interest rates six times
this year, said on Nov. 2 it plans to cap loan-to-value ratios
at 80 percent, raise the risk weighting on larger housing loans
and increase some provisioning requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
