Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. , India’s
largest drugmaker, fell the most in five months in Mumbai
trading after giving no timeframe for when sales to the U.S. of
medicines from two of its factories will resume.  Ranbaxy  fell  3.1 percent to 584.5 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, the steepest fall since May 19. The benchmark
Sensitive Index declined 1.3 percent. The company, based in the
outer suburbs of New Delhi, is “co-operating fully” with U.S.
authorities for “early and comprehensive resolution of all
outstanding issues,” it said in a statement today.  The Indian drugmaker was banned from exporting 30 drugs
from the two factories to the U.S. in September 2008 after
regulators found manufacturing defects at the plants in Paonta
Sahib in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh and Dewas, a
town in central India. Ranbaxy is also under investigation by
the U.S. Department of Justice on charges that it destroyed
reports and falsified data. Former Chief Executive Atul Sobti
said on a conference call with analysts on Aug. 12 that the
company was “a few months away” from a resolution.  “People were anticipating that by the end of this year,
this will be resolved but that doesn’t seem to be the case,”
said Manoj Garg, a pharmaceuticals analyst at Emkay Global
Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai, in a telephone interview.  Ranbaxy reported today that  net income  more than doubled to
3.08 billion rupees ($70 million) because of a gain of more than
1 billion rupees in the value of its foreign currency bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
