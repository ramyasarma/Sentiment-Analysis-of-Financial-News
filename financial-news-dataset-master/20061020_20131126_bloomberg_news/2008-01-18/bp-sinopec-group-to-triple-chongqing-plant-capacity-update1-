             BP Plc (BP/)  and China Petrochemical Corp.
agreed to almost triple the capacity of a chemical plant in
southwestern China to meet demand in the world's fastest-
growing major economy.  
 BP and China's biggest oil refiner signed an agreement to
add an acetic-acid unit with annual capacity of 650,000 metric
tons at Chongqing, BP said in an e-mail today. The capacity of
the plant, which will produce the industrial chemical used in
the making of paint, adhesive and printing ink, will exceed 1
million tons after the unit starts operating in 2011.  
 Chemical makers are competing to gain from rising demand
in China, where the economy expanded more than 11 percent in
the first three quarters of 2007. BP's  China  ventures include
the nation's biggest ethylene plant and the country's first
liquefied natural gas terminal. Rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc
owns a $4.3 billion chemical plant in Nanhai with China
National Offshore Oil Corp.  
 ``BP's total investment in China has exceeded $4 billion
since our arrival some three decades ago,'' Gary Dirks, the
president for Asia Pacific and China, said in the statement.  
 Europe 's second-biggest oil company also signed separate
agreements to study clean-coal technology and build wind power
plants in  Inner Mongolia . The company and the China Academy of
Sciences will study the feasibility of setting up a Clean
Energy Commercialization Center within the year, according to
today's statement.  
 Wind-Power Plants  
 BP and Beijing Tianrun New Energy Investment Co., a unit
of  Goldwind Science & Technology Co.,  will jointly invest,
build and operate three 49.5-megawatt wind power plants near
Bayan Obo in Inner Mongolia, in northern China. Goldwind is the
nation's largest manufacture of wind power turbines.  
 The accords were signed during Prime Minister  Gordon Brown 's first visit as head of state to China.  
 BP and Sinopec Group's Yangtze River Acetyls Co., or
Yaraco, joint venture in Chongqing was formed in December 1995,
costing $200 million. BP has a 51 percent stake and Sinopec
Sichuan Vinylon Works, a unit of Sinopec Group, as China
Petrochemical is known, owns 44 percent. A local government
company has 5 percent, according to  BP's Web site .  
 The plant started operations in 1999 and the partners made
a further investment of $25 million two years later in a
separate 80,000 ton-a-year esters plant, BP said in 2005. The
companies expanded the venture's acetic acid production
capacity from 200,000 tons to 350,000 tons a year in 2005.  
 BP and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , the listed unit
of Sinopec Group, will begin operating another acetic acid
venture in eastern China in 2009 to produce 500,000 tons of the
chemical a year, Sinopec Group said in March last year. The
partners will each invest 250 million  yuan  for equal stakes in
the venture that will be at Nanjing, the capital of the eastern
province of Jiangsu.  
 China may use 25 percent of global chemical output by 2015,
Exxon Mobil Corp. said in May.
