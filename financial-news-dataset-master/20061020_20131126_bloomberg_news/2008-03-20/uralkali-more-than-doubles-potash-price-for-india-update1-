             OAO Uralkali (URKA) , the Russian potash
maker owned by billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, more than doubled
contract prices to  India 's largest fertilizer importer, a jump
that may help the company push for an increase in  China .  
 Uralkali trader Belarusian Potash Co. agreed to sell 750,000
metric tons of potash to India's IPL at $625 a ton, the
Berezniki, Urals-based company said in a statement today.
Belarusian is a joint venture between Uralkali and Belarus-based
potash maker Belaruskali.  
 The increase is a ``significant achievement for Uralkali,''
said Marina Alexeenkova, analyst at Moscow-based  Renaissance
Capital . ``China is the only export market with a price lower
than $500 a ton.''  
 The Indian contract will affect the company's current long-
term supply negotiations with China, which buys about 40 percent
of Uralkali's potash, Alexeenkova said. The price of potash, used
to shield crops from dryness and disease, more than doubled last
year due to expanding demand in China, India and Brazil, and
because of a boom in biofuels. Global supplies trail demand by
1.5 million to 2 million tons.  
 The new price for IPL is $355 more than the previous
agreement set in June, Uralkali said. The agreement runs from May
2008 to March 2009. Urakali's share of the deliveries will be
determined with Belaruskali, the company said.  
 The potash producer,  Russia 's second largest after
Solikamsk-based OAO Silvinit, produced 5.12 million tons of
fertilizer last year.
