Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook
both hit centuries as England drew with South Australia in its
second tuneup match for the Ashes cricket series.  Cook made 111 not out at the Adelaide Oval and Strauss
smashed 102 off 121 balls as the touring team declared its
second innings at 240-1 before lunch on the last day, setting
the home side 308 for victory.  England paceman James Anderson took two wickets as South
Australia reached 48-2 before bad light stopped play and the
match was declared drawn.  England, which won back the Ashes with a 2-1 series victory
last year, faces Australia’s second-string team in its final
warmup before the first Test starts Nov. 25 in Brisbane.  Strauss also scored a century in England’s tour-opening
victory against Western Australia six days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
