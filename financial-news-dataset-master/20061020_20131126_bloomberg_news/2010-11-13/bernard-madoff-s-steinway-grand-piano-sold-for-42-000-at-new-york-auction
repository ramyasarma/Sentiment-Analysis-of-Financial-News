A 10.5-carat diamond ring that
belonged to  Bernard L. Madoff  and his wife, Ruth, sold for
$550,000 today in a New York auction as collectors and dealers
competed for mementos owned by the formerly high-living
confidence man.  The emerald-cut stone was estimated to go for as much as
$350,000. The staccato-tongued auctioneer Bob Sheehan, of
closely held  Gaston & Sheehan , said the ring “supposedly” was
Ruth’s engagement ring. The winning bidder, a man with salt-and-
pepper hair, wearing chinos and a tweed jacket, declined to
identify himself.  Earlier, Madoff’s Steinway & Sons grand piano sold for
$42,000.  “It’s got a little bit of history to it, and it’s
hysterical,” real estate developer John Rodger of East Islip on
Long Island told a scrum of a couple dozen reporters after
placing the winning bid. “It makes it a conversation piece.”  The 6-foot-2-inch piano had a high presale estimate of
$16,000. Rodger, who said he owns eight other pianos, figured
this piano, circa 1917, would have been valued at $22,000
without the Madoff provenance.  The all-day, almost 500-lot sale has attracted hundreds to
a frigid ballroom at the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, as
well as others online. The items were from Madoff’s East Side
Manhattan apartment and Montauk, Long Island, beach house.  The sale was overseen by the  U.S. Marshals Service  to
repay, in part, victims of Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. All items are
being sold without commissions.  Empty photo albums and picture frames went for $1,000. A
leather footstool depicting a bull went for $3,300, almost 10
times its presale high estimate of $360.  As of Sept. 30, approximately $1.5 billion has been
recovered for Madoff’s investors, the trustee overseeing
Madoff’s bankruptcy,  Irving Picard , said in a report.  When he was arrested in December 2008, Madoff’s account
statements reflected 4,900 accounts with $65 billion in
nonexistent investments, according to Picard. Investors lost
about $20 billion in principal.  To contact the reporter on the story:
