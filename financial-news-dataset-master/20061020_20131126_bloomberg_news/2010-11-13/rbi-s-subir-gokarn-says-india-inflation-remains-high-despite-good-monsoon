Reserve Bank of India Deputy
Governor Subir Gokarn said inflation remains high in the nation
despite a good monsoon, driven by increases in food prices.  The central bank will take a “wait-and-watch” approach to
managing interest rates in the immediate future, Gokarn said at
a business conference in Mumbai today.  A liquidity deficit in the financial system, while
desirable, has gone too far in recent weeks and may cause
excessive volatility in short-term rates, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
