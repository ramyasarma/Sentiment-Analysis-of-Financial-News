U.K. Education Secretary  Michael Gove  is seeking to replace the current system of school funding
with a “national funding formula”, the Financial Times said,
citing an unpublished draft of a government policy document.  Currently the U.K. government allocates school funding to
local authorities. The new proposals include a per-pupil payment
made directly to schools by the central government, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
