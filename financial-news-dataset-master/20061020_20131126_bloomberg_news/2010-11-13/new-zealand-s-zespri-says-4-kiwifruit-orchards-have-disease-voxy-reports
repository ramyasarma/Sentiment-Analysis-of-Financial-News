New Zealand officials said four
kiwifruit orchards have been confirmed with a bacterial vine
disease and eight sites have been quarantined, according to
Voxy.co.nz.  A total of 298 orchards have sent in reports of symptoms
of the disease and Minstry of Agriculture officials are
investigating 82 of these sites, Zespri, the largest kiwifruit
seller, said, according to Voxy. Zespri said earlier today it
hopes New Zealand will be the first country to completely
eradicate the airborne bacteria, admitting it may not be
possible if it is too widespread, Voxy reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
