Russian stocks declined for a fourth
day, the longest losing streak in three months, on concern
Europe’s debt problems may deepen and speculation China may
raise interest rates to curb inflation.  OAO Novolipetsk Steel , the country’s largest steelmaker by
market value, fell 2.7 percent to 113.15 rubles as of 11:58 a.m.
in Moscow, while  OAO Severstal ,  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel  and OAO
Polyus Gold all declined more than 1 percent, helping to push
the Micex Index 0.7 percent lower to 1,537.88.  Investors are concerned that the sovereign debt instability
in Ireland and other European countries may spread,  Dmitry Romanov , an analyst at TKB Capital in Moscow, said by phone.
U.S. stocks fell yesterday, pushing the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index to its biggest weekly drop in three months.  “We’re down today, in line with the key global indicators,
though we won’t see large volumes on a Saturday,” Romanov said.
Markets in Russia were open today to make up for a two-day
holiday period last week.  OAO Gazprom , Russia’s gas export monopoly, fell 0.4 percent
to 171.25 rubles after it said it may cut prices for Bulgaria by
5 percent to 7 percent by the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
