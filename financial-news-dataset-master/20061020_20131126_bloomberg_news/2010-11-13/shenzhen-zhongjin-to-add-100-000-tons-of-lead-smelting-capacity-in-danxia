China’s Shenzhen Zhongjin Lingnan
Nonfemet Co. will add 100,000 metric tons of lead smelting
capacity at its Danxia smelter, Yi Jian, the company’s chief
engineer, said today.  “The project has finished a feasibility study and is in
the process of environmental assessment and initial design,” Yi
said at a conference in Shenzhen. Yi did not say when the
additional capacity would come online.  The company is also seeking domestic partners to set up a
100,000 ton zinc smelting plant using zinc oxide ore, Yi said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
