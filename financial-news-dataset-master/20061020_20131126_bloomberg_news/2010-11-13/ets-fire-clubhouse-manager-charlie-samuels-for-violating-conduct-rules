The New York Mets fired clubhouse
manager Charlie Samuels for “conduct in violation of club
policies,” the Major League Baseball team said.  Samuels is linked to illegal gambling being investigated by
Queens District Attorney  Richard Brown ’s office, ESPN reported,
citing unnamed law enforcement sources. He admitted to MLB
officials that he bet on baseball, the sports network said.
Samuels was suspended indefinitely Nov. 4.  “The New York Mets announced today that they have
terminated Charlie Samuels’ employment with the Mets for conduct
in violation of club policies,” the team said in a statement.
“This decision is the result of a thorough internal
investigation over the course of several months.”  Samuels had been the Mets’ clubhouse manager for the past
27 seasons. He joined the team in 1976 after working for the
Philadelphia Phillies.  The Mets declined to give additional information on the
matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
