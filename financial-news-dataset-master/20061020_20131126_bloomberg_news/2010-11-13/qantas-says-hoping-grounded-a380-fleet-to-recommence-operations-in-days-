Qantas Airways Ltd., Australia’s
biggest airline, is hoping to resume Airbus SAS A380 services
“in days, not weeks,” spokesman Tom Woodward said in a phone
interview today. He declined to give a specific timetable for
the planes to restart flying after a Sydney-bound jet was forced
to make an emergency return to Singapore on Nov. 4 after an
engine exploded over Indonesia. Woodward confirmed that engine
problems on a Boeing 767 yesterday on a Melbourne-bound flight
forced the aircraft to return to Perth.
