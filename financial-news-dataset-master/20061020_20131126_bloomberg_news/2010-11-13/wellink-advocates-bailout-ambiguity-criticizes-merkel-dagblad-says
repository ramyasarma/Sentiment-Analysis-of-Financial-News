European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Nout Wellink  called for “ambiguity” on whether
bondholders should help pay for any future sovereign-debt
bailouts,  Het Financieele Dagblad  reported.  “You shouldn’t state beforehand that they will be forced
to pay; let there be uncertainty,” Wellink told the newspaper
in a Nov. 12 interview published today. “I call that
constructive ambiguity.” Wellink, who also heads the Dutch
central bank, refused to rule out forcing investors to share
bailout burdens.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  last month called for
investors to bear some of the burden of a future sovereign-debt
crisis after mid-2013. European finance ministers yesterday
sought to reassure investors who have driven bond yields to
records in Ireland and Portugal, saying that a crisis-resolution
mechanism they’re discussing, which may force bondholders to
share the cost of a bailout, wouldn’t apply to existing debt.  Wellink, referring to Merkel’s comments, said there were
better moments to “make remarks about new instruments than in
the current unrest in the market.” Her remarks helped make
“the situation in the market harder,” he added.  Dutch Central Bank spokesman  Tobias Oudejans  confirmed
Wellink’s comments.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
