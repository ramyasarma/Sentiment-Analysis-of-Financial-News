Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel, one of
four drivers with a chance to win the Formula One championship,
will start from pole position for tomorrow’s season-ending race
in Abu Dhabi.  Vettel beat out McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton by 0.031 seconds
at the Yas Marina circuit to claim his 10th pole this season.
It’s the 15th pole in 19 races this year for Red Bull.  Series leader Fernando Alonso of Ferrari will start third
next to Jenson Button of McLaren. Red Bull’s Mark Webber, second
in the standings, qualified fifth.  Alonso has an eight-point lead over Webber in the
standings, with Vettel 15 points back and Hamilton 24 points
behind. A race victory is worth 25 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
