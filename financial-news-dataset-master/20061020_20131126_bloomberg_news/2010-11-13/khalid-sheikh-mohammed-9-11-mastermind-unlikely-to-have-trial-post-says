The accused mastermind of the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks,  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , may remain
behind bars without trial indefinitely because of disagreement
over his trial location, according to the Washington Post.  The Obama administration has concluded it can’t go ahead
with its original plan to have the trial in federal court in New
York because of opposition from lawmakers and local officials,
the Post said. There is little support for reviving an effort to
hold a military trial at Guantanamo Bay, according to the Post.  Obama administration officials said Mohammed and four
alleged co-conspirators can be held under laws of war, until a
trial location is agreed on, the newspaper reported.  The Post report came after Attorney General  Eric Holder 
told reporters on Nov. 10 the Obama administration was close to
selecting a trial location. Holder said the administration
didn’t make a decision on whether the accused should be tried in
a civilian court or before a military commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
