Invensys Plc  may be bought by
Chinese railcar maker CSR Corp., the Daily Telegraph reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive  Ulf Henriksson .  Henriksson believes CSR “has the possibility of acquiring
Invensys,” though he would prefer the Chinese company to take a
minority stake, the newspaper said.  Invensys and CSR announced an agreement to jointly bid for
a number of international contracts, along with licensing and
supply agreements, on Sept. 17.  Alstom SA, General Electric Co. and Honeywell International
Inc. are also considering making a bid for Invensys, the
Telegraph said, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
