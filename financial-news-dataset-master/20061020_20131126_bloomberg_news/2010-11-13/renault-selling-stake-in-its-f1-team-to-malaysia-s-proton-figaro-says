French carmaker  Renault SA  is about
to sell its remaining 25 percent stake in its namesake Formula
One team to Malaysia’s Proton,  Le Figaro  reported, citing people
close to the matter it didn’t identify.  Proton’s Lotus Cars brand will be the team’s sponsor for
about 30 million euros ($41 million) annually over five years,
and the team’s new name may be Lotus-Renault as the French
automaker will keep providing engines, Le Figaro said.  Renault will also continue making engines for Red Bull
Racing and Malaysia Racing Team, the report said.  Renault last winter sold 75 percent of the team to Genii
Capital Partners, Le Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
