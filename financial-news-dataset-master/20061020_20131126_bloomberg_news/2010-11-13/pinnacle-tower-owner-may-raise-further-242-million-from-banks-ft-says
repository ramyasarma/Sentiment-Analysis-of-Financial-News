Arab Investments Ltd., developer of
London’s Pinnacle tower, may secure added funding of up to 150
million pounds ($242 million), the Financial Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Investors behind the proposed 64-story building have
already pledged 400 million pounds, according to the FT. The
additional funding may be in place within the next few weeks and
could help Arab Investments in negotiations with banks to secure
development financing, the newspaper said.  The new funding will allow building work to continue at the
pace needed to complete construction in 2013, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
