Canada’s dollar dropped from a six-
month high versus the greenback as bets Ireland will need a
bailout and China may increase borrowing costs to control
inflation reduced demand for assets related to economic growth.  The loonie slid this week for the first time since the five
days ended Oct. 22 as the U.S. currency climbed against all of
its 16 most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. Crude oil,
Canada’s biggest export, slumped along with stocks. The nation’s
manufacturing sales fell in September, economists forecast
before a report next week.  “Instead of buy North America, it was buy U.S. dollars and
sell commodity currencies,”  Michael O’Neill , managing director
at Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange Inc., said by phone from
Toronto. “Canada got whacked on that.”  The Canadian dollar depreciated 1.2 percent to C$1.0123 per
U.S. currency yesterday in Toronto, from C$1.0001 on Nov. 5. One
Canadian dollar buys 98.79 U.S. cents. The currency climbed on
Nov. 11 to 99.92 Canadian cents per U.S. dollar, the strongest
level since April 26.  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, had the fifth-smallest drop versus
the greenback among its 16 most-traded counterparts this week.
It touched a level stronger than parity with the U.S. currency
for five consecutive days through Nov. 11 as futures on crude
oil reached the two-year high of $88.63 a barrel before ending
the week by dropping 2.2 percent to $84.98 a barrel.  Harper on G-20  Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  told reporters
yesterday in Seoul following a two-day Group of 20 summit that
leaders failed to find an agreement on tackling imbalances in
currencies and trade, though progress was made.  “It’s fair to say we didn’t resolve those issues here,”
Harper said. “These are not going to be easy issues to resolve,
but I think we’ve got everyone talking the same language,
everyone understanding longer-term what has to be done.”  The euro dropped for a third straight week against the
Canadian dollar, falling 1.5 percent to C$1.3831 after falling
yesterday to the seven-week low of C$1.3662.  European finance ministers sought to reassure investors who
have driven bond yields to record highs in Ireland and Portugal.
Officials from Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. issued
a statement yesterday during the G-20 summit saying a crisis-
resolution mechanism they’re discussing that may force
bondholders to share the cost of a bailout wouldn’t apply to
outstanding debt.  China’s Inflation  China reported on Nov. 11 that consumer prices rose in
October at the fastest pace in two years, spurring speculation
policy makers may raise interest rates.  The MSCI World Index of developed-world stock markets fell
2.2 percent this week, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
decreased 2.2 percent. The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index 
in Toronto lost 1.4 percent.  Canada’s 30-year bonds fell this week, pushing the  yield  up
14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 3.63 percent, the
highest level since Aug. 13. The price of the 5 percent
securities maturing in June 2037 dropped C$2.51 to C$123.57.  On Nov. 17 the government will sell C$1.4 billion ($1.4
billion) in 4 percent securities maturing in June 2041. The
previous auction of 30-year bonds on Sept. 1 drew an average
yield of 3.489 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.272.  Canada’s manufacturing sales dropped 0.9 percent in
September after a 2 percent  gain  in the previous month,
according to the median forecast of 17 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The report from Statistics Canada is due Nov. 16.  The Canadian dollar is “probably not going to go back
through parity for the rest of the year,” said Knightsbridge’s
O’Neill. “The risk is it bounces back to C$1.0375 just on
general year-end demand for dollars.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
