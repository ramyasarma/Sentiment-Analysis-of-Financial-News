Chris Ashton scored two tries and
 Toby Flood  kicked a record 25 points as England beat Australia
35-18 in an international rugby Test in London.  Winger Ashton scored a try in each half yesterday, the
second a 90-meter dash to the line, while Flood’s 25 points
were the most by any player in a Test between the teams.
England’s 35 points was its highest total against the Wallabies.  “Everyone played their hearts out,” England captain
 Lewis Moody  said in an interview with Sky Sports. “It was a
great performance from the squad today. Everyone stepped up.”  England’s second straight victory over Australia after
winning 21-20 in Sydney in June secured its first Twickenham
win over a Tri-Nations team in four years.  Kurtley Beale scored two tries for Australia, which had
beaten top-ranked New Zealand and Wales the past two weekends.  “It was a very good performance from a sharp England
side,” Australian captain  Rocky Elsom  told Sky Sports.  England took a 16-6 halftime lead on Ashton’s try and
three penalties from Flood. Another Flood penalty and Ashton’s
second try increased the lead to 26-6 early in the second half.  Beale scored a try in the 53th minute, though O’Connor
failed to convert, and Flood kicked another penalty. Beale then
touched down again in the 69th minute, before Flood closed the
scoring with two more penalties.  Mils Muliaina  and Hosea Gear each scored twice as New
Zealand ran in seven converted tries to rout Scotland 49-3 in
Edinburgh. Elsewhere, France defeated Fiji 34-12, South Africa
won 29-25 in Wales, Ireland beat Samoa 20-10, and Argentina
defeated Italy 22-16.  In Montevideo, Uruguay and Romania drew 21-21 in the first
match of their home-and-away playoff to decide the 20th and
final spot at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand.  Romania will host the return game Nov. 27 in Bucharest,
with the winner over the two-match series advancing to Pool B
at next year’s tournament alongside Argentina, England,
Scotland and Georgia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
