German bonds fell as Group of 20
leaders discussed Ireland’s debt crisis amid speculation the
European Union will step in with financial aid, easing demand
for the euro region’s safest assets.  The two-year  note  declined for the first week in three as
officials from Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. issued
a statement in South Korea saying a crisis-resolution mechanism
they’re discussing that may force bondholders to share the cost
of a bailout wouldn’t apply to outstanding debt. Irish 10-year
bonds rose for the first day in 14 yesterday, snapping their
longest losing streak in at least three years, and leading so-
called peripheral debt higher. The yield on the 10-year bund
rose for the fourth week in five.  “In this climate of fear, the G-20’s statement offered
some support for Irish debt,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of
European interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “The market is trading on signals of
political solidarity, or lack thereof.”  The yield on the 2-year note rose 12 basis points in the
week to 1.04 percent. The 10-year bund yield was at 2.52
percent, an increase of 10 basis points in the week.  Peripheral nations’ bonds, including Greece, Portugal,
Spain and Ireland, have dropped since European Union leaders
agreed on Oct. 29 to consider German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
proposal for a permanent rescue mechanism as of 2013 that would
involve restructuring with losses for private holders of
sovereign debt. The proposal is part of discussions to create a
permanent crisis facility to replace the rescue fund created in
May after Greece’s near-default.  Financial Backstop  Merkel yesterday said a financial backstop agreed upon by
the EU in May is “in place” if any country needs it, and
rejected criticism by Ireland and others that her push to make
bondholders accountable in any debt crisis after mid-2013
worsened Europe’s current woes.  “Any new mechanism would only come into effect after mid-
2013 with no impact whatsoever on the current arrangements,”
the finance ministers of the five countries said in a statement
distributed today at the G-20 summit.  The  extra yield , or spread, investors demand to hold Irish
10-year debt instead of bunds climbed to 652 basis points on
Nov. 11, the most since Bloomberg began collecting the data in
1991. The spread tumbled as much 86 basis points yesterday to
561 basis points, the biggest daily decline since the EU crafted
a 750-billion euro ($1 trillion) bailout package in May. It rose
41 basis points in the week.  Greek Spread  The Greek-German 10-year spread fell 22 basis points
yesterday to 894 basis points, down from 904 on Nov. 5, compared
with the record 973 basis-point premium reached May 7, before
the EU rescue. The gap between Portuguese and German 10-year
bonds fell 38 basis points to 422 basis points yesterday, up 15
basis points for the week. It reached 484 basis points on Nov.
11, the most on record, according to Bloomberg generic data.  Bunds may rise next week as Spain plans to sell debt
maturing in 2020 and 2041 on Nov. 18. “The G-20 statement was
short of hard facts,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.  “The market community won’t bank on that giving the all-
clear for peripherals. We may see some selling on upticks in
price terms,” Schnautz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
