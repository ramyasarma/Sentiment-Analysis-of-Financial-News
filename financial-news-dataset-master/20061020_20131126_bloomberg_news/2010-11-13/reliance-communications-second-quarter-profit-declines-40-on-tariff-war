Reliance Communications Ltd. ,
India’s No. 2 wireless operator, reported second-quarter profit
fell 40 percent as a price war that slashed tariffs to one penny
a minute damped revenue.  Net income  declined to 4.46 billion rupees ($99 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, from 7.4 billion rupees a year
earlier, the Mumbai-based company said in a statement to the
Bombay Stock Exchange today. That surpassed the 3.59 billion
rupee average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Average revenue per user plunged 38 percent in the year to
June as a price war that began with the entry of NTT DoCoMo Inc.
and Telenor ASA last year hurt call rates while the company’s
debt ballooned. Billionaire Chairman  Anil Ambani  plans to roll
out a third-generation wireless network to lure customers into
using more data plans and revive revenue growth.  “Tariffs are still coming down: The operators are still
dishing out promotional schemes, freebies,” said  Gaurav Tyagi ,
an analyst with Alchemy Share & Stock Brokers Pvt. in Mumbai. He
has a “reduce” rating on Reliance’s shares. “That is keeping
them under pressure. It’s a by-product of competition.”  Revenue fell 10 percent to 51.2 billion rupees during the
quarter, from 57 billion rupees a year earlier. That compared
with the 52.4 billion rupees average of 31 estimates.  The number of subscribers rose 36 percent to 117 million
from 86.1 million a year earlier.  Shares of Reliance fell 3.5 percent to 169.90 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close of trading in Mumbai yesterday. The stock has
retreated 1.4 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent
advance by the benchmark  Sensitive Index , or Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
