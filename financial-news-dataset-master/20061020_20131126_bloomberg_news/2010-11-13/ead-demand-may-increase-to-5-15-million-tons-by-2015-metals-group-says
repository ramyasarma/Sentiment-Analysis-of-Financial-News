China’s lead consumption may reach
5.15 million metric tons by 2015 and zinc demand may total 7.1
million tons, Zhao Cuiqing, director of the lead and zinc
department at the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association,
said today.  Lead consumption may grow at 9 percent per year before 2013
and then slow to 7.5 percent to 8 percent from 2013 to 2015,
Zhao said. Zinc consumption may increase by 9.5 percent a year
in the next five years on demand for galvanized steel, Zhao
said.  China’s total zinc smelting capacity may be limited to
below 7.5 million tons by 2015, and lead should be capped within
5.5 million tons, Zhao said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
