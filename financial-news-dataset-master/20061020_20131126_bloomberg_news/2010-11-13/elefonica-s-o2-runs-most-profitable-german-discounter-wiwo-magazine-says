Telefonica SA ’s German O2 unit
operates the country’s most profitable discount mobile phone
service,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported today, citing its own
calculations.  O2’s Fonic discount brand made a profit of 12 million euros
($16.4 million) as it generated sales of 86 million euros last
year, the news magazine said in the preview of a report to be
published Nov. 15. This compares to Deutsche Telekom AG’s
Congstar brand, which posted a 59 million-euro loss and had
sales of 104 million euros, according to WirtschaftsWoche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
