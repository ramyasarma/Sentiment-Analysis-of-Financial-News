China’s trade with Portuguese
territories including Portugal and Brazil surged 57 percent in
the first nine months of 2010 from a year earlier, Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao said.  Trade rose to $68.2 billion in the January-September
period, Wen said today at a Forum for economic and trade
cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries in
Macau, a former Portuguese colony that returned to Chinese rule
in 1999. China aims to boost bilateral trade with Portuguese-
speaking nations to $100 billion by 2013, Wen said.  China will lower customs barriers with the nations,
stengthen cooperation in resources, infrastructure, agriculture,
finance and logistics, and offer discounted loans to the
nations, Wen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
