Volkswagen AG  wants to increase its
stake in Swedish truck maker Scania AB to between 75 percent and
80 percent,  Spiegel  reported today, citing company documents.  VW holds 46 percent of Scania and plans to raise that stake
by transferring to Scania its almost 30 percent of German truck
producer MAN SE, the newsmagazine said in the preview of a
report to be published Nov. 15.  Scania may then offer to buyout other MAN shareholders
after the transfer, Spiegel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
