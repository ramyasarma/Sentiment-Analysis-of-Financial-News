India, the world’s second-largest
buyer of vegetable oils, may harvest 12.4 percent more monsoon-
sown oilseeds from a year ago because of an increase in area
planted to soybeans and peanuts, a processors’ group said.  Output of oilseeds, including sunflower and sesame seeds,
may climb to 15.4 million metric tons in the year to June 30,
2011, from 13.7 million tons, the  Central Organization for Oil
Industry & Trade  said today. The forecast compares with
17.3 million tons estimated by the farm ministry.  Imports of vegetable oils by India probably totaled 9.2
million metric tons in the year ended Oct. 31, Sushil Goenka,
president of the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India, said
in an interview yesterday.  Farmers planted oilseeds on 17.55 million hectares (43.4
million acres), up from 17.44 million hectares a year earlier,
according to the farm ministry.  The monsoon crop is sown in June and harvested starting
middle of September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
