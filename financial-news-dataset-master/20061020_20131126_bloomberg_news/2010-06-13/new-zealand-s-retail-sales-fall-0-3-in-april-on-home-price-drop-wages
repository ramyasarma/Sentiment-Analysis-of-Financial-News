             New Zealand  retail sales  fell for
the second time in three months in April as house prices
declined and wage growth slowed.  
 Sales  fell 0.3 percent from March when they rose 0.5
percent, seasonally adjusted, Statistics New Zealand said in
Wellington today. The decline was more than the 0.2 percent
median drop forecast of 12 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg  News.
