             Greece isn’t considering
restructuring its debt, Real News said, citing comments from
Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou .  
 The receipt of 110 billion euros ($133 billion) in
emergency loans is enough to cover most of the country’s
borrowing needs in the coming years, and means Greece will be
able to meet its obligations, Papaconstantinou told Real News in
an interview.  
 Talk of Greece leaving the euro is grounded in a “real
ignorance of how the European Union and institutions work” as
well as market speculation, the newspaper cited the minister
saying.  
 Papaconstantinou said he is optimistic about the future of
the euro because the financial crisis has shown that the
countries that use the common currency will step in to bolster
the economy and protect the currency, Real News said.
