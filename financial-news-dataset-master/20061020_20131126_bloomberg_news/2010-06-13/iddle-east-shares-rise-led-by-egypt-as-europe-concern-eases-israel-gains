             Israel and Qatar shares led Middle
East markets higher after global stocks rallied as concern about
Europe’s debt crisis eased and the U.S. Federal Reserve said the
American economic recovery is intact.  
 VeriFone Systems Inc.  jumped the most in more than nine
months after the Israeli provider of electronic payment
technology was raised to “strong buy” at Raymond James &
Associates Inc. Israel’s  TA-25 Index  increased 1.2 percent to
1,103.36, the highest level this month. In the Gulf, Doha’s  QE
Index  gained 1 percent to 6,920.48, the highest level since May
24 and in North Africa, Egypt’s EGX 30 Index gained 0.9 percent.  
 “Local markets tend to follow global trends,” said  Ziad Dabbas , a financial analyst at  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC ,
the United Arab Emirates’ second-largest lender by assets.
“Today’s movements are following positive global closes toward
the end of last week, as they improved investor sentiment.”  
 U.S. stocks rose last week, pushing the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index to the biggest weekly advance since March, after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economic
recovery is intact and commodity prices gained. European stocks
gained for a third week as economic reports and a successful
government bond sale in Spain boosted investors’ confidence.  
 Bonds Advance  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  rose 0.9 percent, the most since
June 2, to 1,528.4.  Arabtec Holding PJSC , the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest builder, climbed 2.1 percent, the most in
almost a week, to 1.97 dirhams.  Ziad Makhzoumi , the company’s
chief financial officer, said in Beirut on June 10 he expects
cash flow to improve now that the Dubai government is helping
developer Nakheel PJSC pay its bills to contractors.  
 VeriFone rose 7.7 percent to 75.30 shekels. Raymond James &
Associates set the 12-month price estimate for the company at
$25 per share. The shares closed at $20.06 on June 11 in New
York.  
 Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  advanced 0.6 percent and
Oman’s  index  rose 0.3 percent, gaining for a fourth day.  The
Kuwait Stock Exchange Index  increased less than 0.1 percent
while Bahrain’s  gauge  fell 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul
All Share  index slipped 0.3 percent after gaining 2.7 percent
yesterday.  
 Israeli government bonds advanced with the benchmark
Mimshal Shiklit note due February 2019 increasing 0.11
shekel to 111.96. The yield fell one basis point to 4.55
percent. The shekel traded at 3.8532 per dollar on June 11.
