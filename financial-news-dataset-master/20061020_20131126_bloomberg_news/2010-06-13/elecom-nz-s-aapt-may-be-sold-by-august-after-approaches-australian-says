             AAPT Ltd. could be sold as early as
August if its owner, Telecom Corp. of New Zealand, accepts one
of several offers for the business, the Australian newspaper
reported, citing AAPT sources it didn’t identify.  
 A group of private equity companies as well as TPG Telecom
Ltd. have approached Telecom NZ with proposals to buy AAPT, the
report said. Those offers have so far been rebuffed.
