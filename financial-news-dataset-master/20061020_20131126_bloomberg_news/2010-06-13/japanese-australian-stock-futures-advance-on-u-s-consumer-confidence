rising sentiment among American consumers boosted speculation

the U.S. New Zealand stocks advanced.  
 American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. , an electronics
maker that gets 21 percent of its revenue in the U.S., finished

of U.S. consumer confidence climbed to a more than two-year high.
 Canon Inc. , the world’s biggest digital-camera maker, gained 0.8
percent.  
 “Investors have been concerned about a double-dip
recession in the U.S. later this year,” said  Tomochika Kitaoka ,

report on consumer sentiment showed it is less likely to be the
case as the economy continues to recover.”

 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has lost 6.7 percent this year,
set for its biggest six-month slide since the period ended
December 2008, on concern mounting government deficits in Europe
and China’s measures to cool its property market will dampen the
global economic recovery. The slump has driven down the average
price of stocks in the gauge to 14.4 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with 20.1 times at the beginning of this year.  
 In New York, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.4

the highest level since January 2008. Earlier, the S&P 500
dropped as much as 0.9 percent after a Commerce Department
report showed sales at U.S. retailers dropped 1.2 percent in May,
the first decline in eight months.

by 2020, saying inaction may send Japan into bankruptcy.
