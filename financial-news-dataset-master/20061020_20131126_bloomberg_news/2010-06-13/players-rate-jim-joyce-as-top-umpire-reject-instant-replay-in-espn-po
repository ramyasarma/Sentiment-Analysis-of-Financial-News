             Jim Joyce , whose blown call
cost Detroit Tigers pitcher  Armando Galarraga  a perfect
game, is rated the best umpire in Major League Baseball in
a poll of 100 players taken by  ESPN The Magazine .  
 The poll, taken after Galarraga’s near-perfect game on
June 2, also found little support for instant replay --
with 22 percent of respondents favoring replay for calls on
the bases, such as Joyce’s mistaken safe call on what would
have been the final out of the game.  
 Joyce was selected as best umpire by 53 percent of the
players, who answered anonymously when asked to select the
three best and three worst umpires in baseball.  Tim McClelland  was next with 34 percent.  
 Players agreed with Commissioner  Bud Selig ’s decision
not to award Galarraga a perfect game, with 86 percent of
those surveyed saying Joyce’s mistake should not have been
overturned.
