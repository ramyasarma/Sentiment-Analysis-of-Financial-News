             KKR & Co. , the buyout firm run by
 Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , may purchase about $400 million
of Texas shale assets from Hilcorp Energy Co., two people with
direct knowledge of the talks said.  
 KKR and  Hilcorp , a closely held exploration and production
company based in Houston, may partner to develop the formation
known as Eagle Ford in the southern part of the state, which has
unconventional gas deposits, according to one of the people who
declined to be identified because the deal is private. KKR’s
purchase of a stake may be announced as early as today, the
person said.  
 KKR spokeswoman Kristi Huller said she couldn’t comment.
Calls to Hilcorp over the weekend weren’t returned.
Unconventional gas is the industry term to describe fuel trapped
in shale formations, coal beds and impermeable sandstone rock.  
 Marc Lipschultz , global head of KKR’s energy and
infrastructure business, is looking for oil and gas investments
as the New York-based buyout firm exits a 1-year-old minority
stake in East Resources Inc. That developer, focusing on the
Appalachian basin’s Marcellus Shale area, agreed last month to
sell itself to Royal Dutch Shell Plc for $4.7 billion.  
 “Now is an excellent time to own and invest in oil and gas
assets and operations, and we are seeing many promising
opportunities in today’s environment.” Lipschultz said in a
June 1 statement about the sale.  
 KKR purchased the stake in Warrendale, Pennsylvania-based
East Resources for about $350 million in June 2009, a person
familiar with the transaction said at the time.  
 ‘Much More Oil’  
 Eagle Ford is about 50 miles wide and 400 miles long,
extending from Texas’s southern border to the eastern part of
the state, according to the Railroad Commission of Texas, which
regulates the oil industry. The formation delivers natural gas
and “appears to produce much more oil” than other shale
fields, the agency wrote in a  description  on its website.  
 Companies including  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  BP Plc  are
snapping up unconventional gas reserves, betting that prices for
the cleaner-burning fuel will rise as governments curb carbon
dioxide emissions and as more accessible areas dwindle.  
 Private-equity managers have resumed deal making after an
almost three-year slump. Buyout firms have announced $31 billion
in transactions this year, more than five times the amount in
the same period in 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 In February, KKR said it will partner with Premier Natural
Resources LLC, the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company founded by
former executives of Vintage Petroleum Inc., to seek oil and gas
investments in North America.  
 KKR began making acquisitions in the energy industry in
1985, when it bought Union Texas Petroleum. In 2007, the firm
and TPG, a Fort Worth, Texas-based private-equity firm, agreed
to buy power producer TXU Corp., now Energy Future Holdings, for
$45 billion in the largest leveraged buyout on record.
