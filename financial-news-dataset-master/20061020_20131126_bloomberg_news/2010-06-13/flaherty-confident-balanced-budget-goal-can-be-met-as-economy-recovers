             Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he’s confident he can balance the budget as the
country’s economy recovers, and wants provinces to agree to
“modest” increases in the nation’s pension benefits.  
 “Our balanced budget goal will be met without reducing
federal transfers to provinces and territories or transfers to
individuals,” Flaherty told reporters today in Charlottetown,
Prince Edward Island.  
 Flaherty, who begins a two-day meeting with his provincial
counterparts in Canada’s smallest province, said he wants to
reach an agreement on the “direction” of changes to the
national pension plan. While rejecting the idea of doubling
contributions to the  Canada Pension Plan , he said increases will
be needed.  
 “We should consider a modest, phased-in, fully funded
enhancement to defined benefits,” Flaherty, 60, said. “It’s
essential that we work together on Canada Pension Plan issues,
since we’re all responsible together for the governance of the
plan.”  
 Flaherty also said the rules should be changed to
accommodate “innovations” such as letting financial
institutions offer broad-based pension plans for multiple
employers and self-employed workers.
