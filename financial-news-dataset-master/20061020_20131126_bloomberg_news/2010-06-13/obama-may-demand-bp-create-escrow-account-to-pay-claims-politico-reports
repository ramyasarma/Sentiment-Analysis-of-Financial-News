             President  Barack Obama  may seek to
have  BP Plc  establish an escrow account funded by the company to
pay oil claims damages,  Politico  reported, citing an
unidentified White House official.  
 Obama will focus on the escrow fund when he meets at the
White House with BP Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  and other
executives on June 16, the Washington-based publication said. An
independent third-party panel would be charged with paying the
claims, Politico said.  
 The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for
comment today.  
 Obama is prepared to invoke all presidential powers to
ensure that money is set aside to pay damages to people and
businesses, Politico reported.  
 BP has 50,101 claims and has paid $58.1 million in damages
as of June 11.
