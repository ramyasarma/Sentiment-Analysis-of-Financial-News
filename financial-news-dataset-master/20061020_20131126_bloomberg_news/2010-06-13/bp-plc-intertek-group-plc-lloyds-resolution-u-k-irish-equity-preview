             U.K. stocks climbed, sending the
benchmark FTSE 100 Index up for a fourth day, the longest rising
streak since March, as higher metals prices boosted the outlook
for basic-resources companies. BP Plc tumbled.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd., Rio Tinto Group and Xstrata Plc led raw-
material shares higher.  Weir Group Plc  soared 12 percent after
the world’s biggest maker of pumps for the mining industry said
it expects second-half profit to be “significantly” ahead of
last year. BP plunged 9.3 percent as it battles with the worst
oil spill in U.S. history.  
 The  FTSE 100  advanced 38.45, or 0.7 percent, to 5,202.13.
The  FTSE All-Share Index  gained 0.7 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ
Index  climbed 0.2 percent.  
 The FTSE 100 remains 48 percent higher than in March 2009
amid signs the global economy is recovering. Still, the gauge
has fallen 11 percent from this year’s high on April 15 on
concern that Europe’s debt crisis will hurt the economic
recovery and as BP lost more than a third of its value following
the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 “As economists have started to process potential downside
scenarios so markets have been able to assess prospects from
global growth and the news here is relatively reassuring,”  Gary Baker , a European equity strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research wrote in a report today. “We see no reason to
downgrade earnings.” He estimates profits in Europe will grow
10 percent by year-end.  
 Budget Deficit  
 Britain’s budget deficit will narrow more than expected
even as the economy grows more slowly than the previous
government forecast, the U.K.’s new fiscal watchdog said in a
report prepared for the June 22 emergency budget.  
 BHP Billiton gained 2.7 percent to 1,921 pence. Rio Tinto
climbed 3 percent to 3,312 pence. Xstrata advanced 3.3 percent
to 1,033 pence. Copper rose for a fifth day in London and lead,
nickel tin and zinc climbed.  
 Weir surged 12 percent to 1,066 pence. The company also
said it agreed to buy the Linatex group of companies based in
Kuala Lumpur for $200 million.  
 Majestic Wine Plc  advanced 7.2 percent to 292 pence as the
owner of the U.K.’s largest chain of wine warehouses said full-
year pretax profit more than doubled to 16 million pounds ($23
million) in the year ended March 29.  
 BP Dividend  
 BP  tumbled 9.3 percent to 355.45 pence, its lowest level
since October 2008. The fastest-growing bet on BP shares in the
U.S. stock-options market shows traders expect a 63 percent
plunge in about a month as costs related to the well spewing oil
into the Gulf of Mexico surge.  
 Industry and regulatory analysts said the company may lose
control of its U.S. oil and natural gas wells and be barred from
doing business with the federal government as punishment for the
leak.  
 Resolution Ltd.  shares were suspended at the request of the
company. The U.K. buyout firm founded by  Clive Cowdery  said it
plans to raise about 2 billion pounds in a rights offering to
help fund its purchase of Axa SA’s U.K. life insurance
operations. Resolution said it is in talks to buy the business
for 2.75 billion pounds. The company will also issue 500 million
pounds of deferred consideration notes to Axa.
