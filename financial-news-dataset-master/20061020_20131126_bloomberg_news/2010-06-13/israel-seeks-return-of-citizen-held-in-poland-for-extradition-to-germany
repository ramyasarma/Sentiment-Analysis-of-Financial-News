             Poland should return an Israeli
citizen it has arrested on suspicion of aiding in the
assassination of a senior Hamas official in Dubai in January
rather than extraditing him to Germany, Israeli Tourism Minister
Stas Misezhnikov said.  
 “Poland needs to say to Germany that it will return this
Israeli citizen to Israel, and if there is a complaint against
him, I believe we also have judicial institutions that are
trusted by the international community,” Misezhnikov said on
Israel’s Army Radio today.  
 Poland last week detained an alleged Mossad agent
reportedly known as Uri Brodsky, who was taken into custody
under a European arrest warrant issued by Germany, Andreas
Christeleit, spokesman of Germany’s Karlsruhe-based Federal
Prosecutor’s office said yesterday.  
 Prosecutors allege that Brodsky used a stay in Germany to
help a fellow Mossad agent obtain a German passport to enter
Dubai and assist in the murder of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founder
of the armed wing of Hamas.
