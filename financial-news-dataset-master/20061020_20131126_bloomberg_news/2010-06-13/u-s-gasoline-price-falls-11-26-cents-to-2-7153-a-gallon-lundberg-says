             The average price of regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell to $2.7153 as demand for
the motor fuel declined.  
 Gasoline lost 11.26 cents in the three weeks ended June 11,
according to a survey of 2,500 filling stations nationwide by
 Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst in Camarillo,
California, who added that prices have fallen 20.51 cents over
the past five weeks.  
 Gasoline supply has reached a “glut,” she said. “Demand
is falling due to continued underemployment while supply is up
as refiners have increased their refinery utilization.”  
 U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump slumped 5.8 percent in the
week ended June 4 as motorists drove fewer miles over the
Memorial Day weekend,  MasterCard Inc.  said on June 8 in its
SpendingPulse report. Motorists bought an average 9.146 million
barrels of motor fuel a day, the lowest level since the week
ended Feb. 12.  
 Averaged over the past four weeks, gasoline demand, as
measured by what refiners and blenders supply to wholesalers,
was down 1 percent from a year earlier, the Energy Department
said June 9.  
 Stockpiles of gasoline were steady at 219 million barrels
in the week ended June 4, according to the department.
 Inventories  were 8.6 percent above a year earlier.  
 Market Oversupply  
 Refiners “have to seek operational efficiency” and
maintain sales, Lundberg said. “There has been enough
oversupply to kick prices down.”  
 The front-month contract for crude oil gained 5.3 percent
in the three weeks ended June 11. Gasoline futures rose 4.5
percent.  
 Regular gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell
0.01 cent to $2.701 a gallon, AAA said on its  website .  
 On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $2.92 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.02 a
gallon.  
 Of the cities surveyed by Lundberg on June 11, the highest
price was San Francisco at $3.10 a gallon. The cheapest place to
buy gasoline was Jackson, Mississippi, where a gallon averaged
$2.43, she said.
