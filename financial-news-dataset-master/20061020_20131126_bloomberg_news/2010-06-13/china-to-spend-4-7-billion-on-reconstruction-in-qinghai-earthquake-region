             China plans to spend about 32
billion yuan ($4.7 billion) rebuilding in regions hit by the
deadly April 14 earthquake in northwestern Qinghai province,
the government said today.  
 The bulk of the money will come from the national budget,
with the rest from Qinghai’s government, donations and
corporate funding, according to a  reconstruction plan  posted on
the State Council’s website.  
 Banks are encouraged to lend to area and locally
incorporated lenders will enjoy favorable deposit reserve
requirements, the statement said without giving specifics. Main
reconstruction tasks are estimated to be completed in three
years, it added.  
 The death toll from the 7.1-magnitude tremor rose to 2,698
as of May 30, with 270 still missing, according to the
statement.
