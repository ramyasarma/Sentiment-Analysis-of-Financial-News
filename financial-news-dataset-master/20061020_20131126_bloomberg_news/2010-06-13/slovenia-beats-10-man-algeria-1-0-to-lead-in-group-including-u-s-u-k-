             Slovenia beat 10-man Algeria 1-0 in
Polokwane, South Africa, to go top of World Cup Group C.  
 Robert Koren got the goal in the 79th minute when
goalkeeper Fawzi Chaouchi allowed his shot to squirm past his
left hand. Seven minutes earlier, Abdelkader Ghezzal of Algeria
was dismissed for a second yellow card, for handball.  
 The win leaves Slovenia on three points. England and the
U.S. have one each after their 1-1 draw yesterday, while Algeria
has no points.  
 Scoring chances were limited today in a lackluster game
that provided little fluent soccer.  
 Algeria, who reached the World Cup after a playoff with
Egypt, went close after 35 minutes when Slovenia failed to deal
with a corner and Rafik Halliche headed just wide.  
 Just before halftime Karim Matmour shot over after being
set up by Nadir Belhadj as Algeria increased the pace. Then
Slovenia hit back and Valter Birsa’s shot was tipped over by
Chaouchi just before halftime.  
 In the 70th minute Ghezzal headed over for Algeria as his
team stepped up the pressure, and soon after was dismissed for
the second yellow.  
 England and the U.S. drew in the same group yesterday.
Steven Gerrard gave England an early lead, and the U.S. hit back
before halftime when a mistake by goalkeeper Robert Green
allowed a shot by Clint Dempsey to bobble into the net.  
 Later today Serbia plays Ghana and Germany meets Australia,
both in Group D.
