             South Africa’s World Cup organising
committee would ban vuvuzelas from inside stadiums during the
tournament “if there are grounds to do so,” the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.  
 Broadcasters and supporters have complained that the high-
pitched horns drown out singing and damage the atmosphere at
games, the broadcaster reported, citing Danny Jordaan, head of
the World Cup organising committee.  
 FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said he was unaware of
Jordaan’s comments in an e-mailed response to questions.
