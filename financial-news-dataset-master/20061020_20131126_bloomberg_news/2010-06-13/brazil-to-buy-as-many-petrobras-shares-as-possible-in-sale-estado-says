             Brazil’s government will buy as many
shares as possible in  Petroleo Brasileiro SA ’s planned sale,  O
Estado de São Paulo  reported, citing Oil, Gas and Renewable
Fuels Secretary  Marco Antonio Martins Almeida .  
 If minority shareholders buy all the shares they have a
right to, the government’s stake in the company will remain the
same. If there is stock left over, the government will step in
and increase its stake, Almeida said, according to Estado.  
 Brazilian lawmakers voted last week to allow Petrobras, as
the company is known, to issue new shares in exchange for the
rights to tap government reserves off the South American
country’s coast. The company is seeking to fund as much as $220
billion in spending through 2014.  
 The government can transfer to Petrobras, Almeida told
Estado, “much more” than 5 billion barrels of government-owned
oil, and Petrobras would return the exploration rights to the
government after extracting the 5 billion barrels it’s entitled
to.  
 The Franco well will be part of the reserves-shares swap,
as well as Libra, Jupiter and Iara, Almeida said, according to
Estado.
