             The biggest junk bond market rally
in more than a decade is increasing the risk investors in Asian
high-yield debt will be roiled by early redemptions, according
to  Morgan Stanley  and Credit Agricole CIB.  
 Cheaper funding alternatives such as loans make companies
more likely to buy back callable notes, unsettling investors who
may be forced to reinvest at lower rates or in more volatile
assets. Thirty-five percent of liquid Asian junk bonds are
callable -- most this year -- and about 20 percent are trading
above or close to their call price, according to Morgan Stanley
research.  
 “I’d be advising investors to shift their funds elsewhere
for the moment,”  Brayan Lai , a credit analyst at Credit
Agricole in Hong Kong, said in a telephone interview. Rising
bond prices suggest “it’s not a compelling signal to buy.”  
 Asian high-yield dollar bonds returned 80 percent last year
as prices recovered from the credit freeze triggered by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 collapse. The region’s junk-grade
companies, rated less than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s, sold the most bonds in the
first half of this year since the first six months of 2007,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Morgan Stanley estimates the companies raised so much money
during 2009’s credit rally that most have met their funding
needs for this year.  
 ‘Liquidity Cushion’  
 “For the first time in living memory, Asia high-yield is
pre-funded, providing a liquidity cushion which historically was
never there,” said  Viktor Hjort , a Hong Kong-based credit
strategist at Morgan Stanley. That could increase the temptation
for borrowers to call “expensive” bonds, he said.  
 PT Matahari Putra Prima’s  $200 million of 10.75 percent
bonds due 2012 and callable in August at 105.38 cents on the
dollar were trading at 105 cents June 11, while  Parkson Retail
Group Ltd.’s  $125 million of 7.125 percent bonds due 2012, which
can be bought back at 103.56 cents in July, traded as high as
104.38 cents in April.  
 Agile Property Holdings Ltd. , a developer of residential
villas and condos in China’s Guangdong province, called its 9
percent bonds due 2013 on June 7 at 106.77 cents on the dollar.  
 The Hong Kong-listed company raised $637 million selling
8.875 percent notes due 2017 in April and in January agreed to a
$125 million loan maturing in 2013. The 9 percent 2013 notes
traded at 106.75 cents the day of the buyback, down from 107
cents on April 21.  
 “We do buy bonds trading above the call price when we
believe the probability of their being called is low or the
yield-to-call is attractive,” said  Mark Thurgood , head of
research at  Saka Capital Ltd ., a Singapore-based hedge fund that
focuses on liquid Asian credit. “In general, alternative
funding sources are only available to the better-quality
names.”  
 Bond Fund Flows  
 Emerging-market bond funds took in $824 million in the week
ended June 9, a five-week high, according to  EPFR Global , which
tracks fund flows. The trend has been “broadly positive” even
with the threat of Europe’s debt crisis spreading, said  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s  Asia-Pacific head of credit
strategy,  Tim Jagger .  
 “Credit market participation from non-traditional
investors has been substantial since 2008 as high yields attract
equity income and retail money,” Jagger said in a Singapore
briefing on June 8.  
 Galaxy  
 Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. , a Macau casino and hotel
operator, called its $350 million of 9.875 percent bonds due
December 2012 on May 24 at 104.94 cents. Galaxy got a HK$9
billion ($1.16 billion) loan from seven banks in April that pays
interest of 4.5 percentage points more than the  Hong Kong
interbank offered rate .  
 Hibor, a funding benchmark, averaged 0.13389 percent in
April compared with 0.87132 percent the same month a year
earlier. One month before the call date Galaxy’s 2012 bonds were
at 104.5 cents on the dollar.  
 Most high-yield Asian companies “are on the lookout to
extend their debt maturity profiles in line with capital
expenditure,” Credit Agricole’s Lai said. “If a company
estimates it can generate an all-in cost saving by financing an
older short-dated bond with a longer-dated bond or loan, there’s
a possibility the company may trigger the call.”
