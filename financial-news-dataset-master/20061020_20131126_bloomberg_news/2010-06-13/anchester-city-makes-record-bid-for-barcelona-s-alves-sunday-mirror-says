             Manchester City has made a British
record 40 million-pound ($58.2 million) bid for Barcelona
fullback Daniel Alves and wants to sign his teammate Yaya Toure,
the Sunday Mirror reported.  
 Barcelona rejected the bid for Alves, although the 28-year-
old wants the opportunity to talk to City because he feels
promises have been broken over his contract, the newspaper said,
without citing anyone.  
 City would treble Alves’s 62,000 pounds a week wages,
according to the Mirror
