             Factories kept churning out more
goods last month, while prices and home construction fell,
pointing to a manufacturing-led U.S. recovery that is not
generating inflation, economists said before reports this week.  
 Production at factories, mines and utilities increased 0.8
percent in May, the 10th gain in the past 11 months, according
to the median estimate of 63 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News ahead of Federal Reserve figures due June 16. The cost of
living declined for a second month and work began on fewer
houses, other data may show.  
 “It’s really a sweet spot in terms of continuing growth
without inflation,” said  Brian Bethune , chief U.S. financial
economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
“Manufacturing is still in pretty good shape.”  
 The need to replenish depleted inventories, growing  sales
overseas  and business investment in new equipment are putting
American factories at the forefront of the rebound from the
worst recession since the 1930s. A lack of inflation means the
Fed has scope to keep the target interest rate near zero in
coming months to spur growth.  
 Manufacturers added 29,000  workers  to payrolls in May, a
fifth consecutive gain, the workweek lengthened and the average
amount of  overtime  climbed to the highest level in two years,
pointing to an acceleration on factory floors, data from the
Labor Department showed earlier this month.  
 Factory Gains  
 Regional reports may show manufacturing kept driving the
recovery this month. Factories in the  New York Fed  district
expanded for an 11th month, a June 15 report will show, while
data from the  Philadelphia Fed  two days later will say those in
its area grew for a 10th month, according to economists
surveyed.  
 Deere & Co ., the world’s largest farm-equipment maker, said
on its website last week that sales of utility tractors rose in
the “double digits” in May, compared with a 6 percent increase
for the industry overall.  
 Growing global demand for agricultural commodities, housing
and infrastructure are driving sales,  Samuel Allen , chief
executive officer of the Moline, Illinois-based company, said
last month in a statement. Deere last month raised earnings and
sales forecasts for a second time this year after second-quarter
profit top analysts’ estimates.  
 Manufacturing shares are outperforming the broader market.
The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite  Machinery Index , which
includes Deere and Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc., is
up 7 percent so far this year, compared with a 2.1 decline in
the S&P  500 Index  on growing concern that the European debt
crisis will slow global growth.  
 Less Inflation  
 Three reports from the Labor Department this week will show
the plunge in fuel prices precipitated by the turmoil in
financial markets is tamping inflation.  
 The  import-price index , due on June 15, dropped 1.3 percent
in May, after an increase of 0.9 percent the prior month. The
producer-price index, issued the following day, declined 0.5
percent after a 0.1 percent decrease in April, according to the
survey median.  
 Consumer prices in May are forecast to drop 0.2 percent,
after declining 0.1 percent the previous month, the survey
median showed. Excluding food and fuel, the so-called core rate
rose 0.1 percent after no change the previous month, economists
projected.  
 The lack of inflation validates the Fed’s strategy to
maintain the  benchmark  lending rates on overnight loans between
banks near zero to spur growth. Their next decision on interest
rates is due June 23.  
 Home Construction  
 One area that may not fare well in coming months is
housing.  Work began  on 648,000 houses at an annual pace last
month, down from a 672,000 rate in April, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed before Commerce
Department figures June 16.  
 The end of a government tax credit at the end of the month
will cool sales and construction in the second half of the year,
economists said. The incentive for first-time homebuyers worth
as much as $8,000, which was extended in November to include
some current owners, required contracts be signed by April 30
and settled by June 30.  
 Finally, a report from the Conference Board, a New York-
based research group, will show growth outlook brightened last
month. The group’s index of leading economic indicators, due on
June 17, increased 0.4 percent in May, according to economists
surveyed. The measure had climbed for 12 consecutive months
before declining 0.1 percent in April.
