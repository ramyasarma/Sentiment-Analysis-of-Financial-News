             The U.S. Coast Guard said  BP Plc  has
until tomorrow to  find  more capacity to contain its leaking oil
well in the Gulf of Mexico, as U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
expressed “sadness” yesterday about the spill to President
 Barack Obama .  
 Scientists and researchers doubled their estimates of the
spill’s size on June 10, and BP’s efforts don’t “provide the
needed collection capacity consistent with the revised flow
estimates,” said Rear Admiral James A. Watson, the federal on-
scene coordinator, in a letter dated June 11. It was sent to
 Doug Suttles , BP’s chief operating officer for exploration and
production, and was released yesterday.  
 BP  plans to almost triple its capacity to capture oil from
its leaking well to as much as 50,000 barrels a day by mid-July,
the Coast Guard said June 11. The plan calls for two pairs of
production ships and shuttle tankers to replace a cluster of
vessels at the site, Coast Guard Admiral  Thad Allen , the
government’s national incident commander for the spill, said
June 11 at a press conference in Washington.  
 The well was releasing between 20,000 barrels and 40,000
barrels a day, twice as much as previously estimated, before BP
cut away a kinked pipe on June 3, U.S. government scientists and
independent researchers reported June 10. They are still
studying the current leak rate. BP recovered about 7,570 barrels
of oil from midnight to noon yesterday.  
 Call With Cameron  
 Based on government estimates, the drillship isn’t
capturing as much of the spill as BP predicted earlier this
month. In a June 4 interview with CBS, Suttles said the system
would be capable of capturing as much as 90 percent of the flow.  
 The additional ships planned next month will give BP backup
pumping ability in the event that one of the vessels can’t be
used, Allen said.  
 “The issue is for BP to move quickly,” Allen said.  
 In its application for the well, BP told the government it
was prepared for a worst-case oil spill of 250,000 barrels a
day.  
 U.K. Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama, meantime,
talked yesterday and Cameron expressed his “sadness” at the
“human and environmental catastrophe” caused by the spill.  
 “The president and prime minister agreed that BP should
continue -- as they have pledged -- to work intensively to
ensure that all sensible and reasonable steps are taken as
rapidly as practicable to deal with the consequences of this
catastrophe,” Cameron’s office in London said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Pensacola  
 In the Florida panhandle, the city of Pensacola began
taking additional steps to protect its marshes and inlets from
oil creeping closer to the coast.  
 Officials closed the area’s two main entries for boats June
11 in an attempt to capture the oil before it gets to the inter-
coastal waterways and sensitive areas, Pensacola Mayor Mike
Wiggins said in an interview yesterday. The oil could do “grave
damage,” he said.  
 “The oil is very close to our shores,” he said. “The
weekend is going to be very challenging for us.”  
 A plume of oil was detected June 11, 9 miles (14.5
kilometers) south of Pensacola Pass, and another plume of oil
was seen six miles (9.7 kilometers) south of Escambia County,
Florida, Sonya Daniel, a county spokeswoman, said.  
 Meeting on Dividend  
 The spill began after the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon
sank April 22, following a blowout of BP’s well that killed 11
of its crew.  
 It has closed as much as 37 percent of the Gulf of Mexico
to fishing, cut offshore drilling in the nation by half,
polluted 140 miles (225 kilometers) of shoreline from Louisiana
to Florida, and cost BP more than $1.43 billion.  
 Separately, BP said yesterday its board will meet June 14
to discuss whether to cut or defer its second-quarter dividend
payment following the spill.  
 A decision on the dividend may not be reached at the
meeting, BP spokesman  Robert Wine  said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “All options are being considered,” he said. “No
decision has been taken.”
