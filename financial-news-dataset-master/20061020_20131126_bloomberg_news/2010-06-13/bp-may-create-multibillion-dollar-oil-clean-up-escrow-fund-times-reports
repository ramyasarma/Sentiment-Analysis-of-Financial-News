             BP Plc  may create a multibillion
dollar, ring-fenced fund to cover the cost of cleaning up the
oil leaking from its damaged well in the Gulf of Mexico, the
Sunday Times reported, citing unidentified company officials.  
 The fund is one of the options the BP board will consider
when they meet tomorrow, the newspaper said. The directors will
also discuss reducing dividend payments, though they are
unlikely to cut the payments completely, the Times said.  
 “No decision has yet been made and all the options will be
considered at the appropriate time,” spokeswoman  Sheila Williams  said when contacted in London.
