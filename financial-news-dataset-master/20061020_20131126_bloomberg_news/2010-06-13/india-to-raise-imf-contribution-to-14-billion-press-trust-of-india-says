             India plans to increase its
contribution to the International Monetary Fund by $4 billion as
the multilateral lender helps European countries facing the
sovereign debt crisis, the Press Trust of India reported, citing
a finance ministry official it didn’t identify. India’s total
commitment under the IMF’s new arrangement to borrow will
increase to $14 billion, the news agency reported.
