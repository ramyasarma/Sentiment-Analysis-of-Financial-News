             FIFA, soccer’s governing body, will
help Al Jazeera television locate those responsible for
interfering with the channel’s coverage of the World Cup.  
 “FIFA is supporting Al Jazeera in trying to locate the
source of the interference,” the organization said in an e-
mailed statement today. “FIFA is appalled by any action to try
to stop Al Jazeera’s authorized transmissions of the FIFA World
Cup as such actions deprive football fans from enjoying the
world game in the region. It is not acceptable to FIFA.”  
 Al Jazeera Sport , which has exclusive World Cup
transmission rights for the entire Middle East and North Africa
region, experienced transmission disruptions from unknown
sources during the June 11 opening soccer match and some
subsequent games, Qatari newspaper  The Peninsula  reported today.  
 The World Cup is being hosted by South Africa, the first
nation on the continent to host the world’s most-watched sports
event. The World Cup takes place every four years.
