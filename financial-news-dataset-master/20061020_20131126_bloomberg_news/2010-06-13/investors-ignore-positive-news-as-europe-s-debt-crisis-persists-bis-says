             Europe’s sovereign debt crisis has
created an environment in which investors are dwelling on
negative developments even when data show economic recovery, the
Bank for International Settlements said.  
 “Against this background of heightened uncertainty, market
participants focused on the deteriorating financial-market
conditions while often ignoring positive macroeconomic news,”
the Basel, Switzerland-based  BIS  said in its quarterly report
today. “The April jobs report, for example, saw U.S. non-farm
payrolls increase by 100,000 more jobs than expected to 290,000,
but the S&P 500 Index fell by 1.5 percent on the day.”  
 The debt crisis sent the euro to a four-year low against
the dollar on June 7 and has wiped out more than $4 trillion
from global stock markets this year. European leaders unveiled a
750 billion-euro ($910 billion) rescue mechanism last month to
stem contagion from Greece, initially reversing a surge in the
risk premium on Spanish and Portuguese bonds.  
 “The relief in markets turned out to be temporary,
however, as investor confidence soon deteriorated on worries
about the possible interactions between public debt and
growth,” the BIS said.  
 As investors’ attention turned to growth prospects on the
periphery of the euro region and Fitch Ratings stripped Spain of
its AAA rating, citing a sluggish growth outlook, the  extra
yield  investors demand to hold Spanish debt rather than German
equivalents rose to a euro-era high of 216 basis points on June
8, easing to 188 basis points on June 11. The differential on
Portuguese debt stood at 255 basis points on June 11.  
 Investor Concerns  
 “Investors questioned the robustness of global growth due
to a number of factors in recent weeks, including the risk that
the surge of public debt could derail the economic recovery and
growing concerns that the financial system was more fragile than
previously thought,” BIS Economic Adviser  Stephen Cecchetti ,
head of the monetary and economic department, told journalists
in a June 11 conference call.  
 Some European nations risk a “double dip” economic
slowdown if the region fails to manage its debt crisis, the
World Bank said June 9.  
 “If markets lost confidence in the credibility of efforts
to put policy on a sustainable path, global growth could be
significantly impaired and a double-dip recession could not be
excluded,” the Washington-based lender said in its report.
