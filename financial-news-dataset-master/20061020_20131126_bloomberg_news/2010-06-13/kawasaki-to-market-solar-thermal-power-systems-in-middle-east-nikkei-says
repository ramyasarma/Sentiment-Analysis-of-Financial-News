             Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. will
this year start marketing solar-thermal power plants, the Nikkei
newspaper reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  
 The company wants to sell the generation systems, which are
used in conjunction with gas turbines, to power companies in the
Middle East and North Africa. The systems may cost several tens
of billions of yen, the report said.
