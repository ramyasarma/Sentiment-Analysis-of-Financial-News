-- Currency Swaps Are Better Tool to Ease Shortages Than Reserves, BIS Says

             Swaps tend to be more effective at
easing shortages of foreign currency than tapping a country’s
own international cash reserves, according to a Bank for
International Settlements study of South Korea.  
 The cost of borrowing dollars for South Korean banks soared
at the end of 2008 as credit markets froze during the global
financial crisis. Policy makers responded by first supplying
dollars from the nation’s foreign reserves, then by swapping won
for the U.S. currency with the Federal Reserve.  
 The currency swaps with the Fed “enhanced market
confidence more effectively because they were adding to Korea’s
foreign reserves,” according to the report, co-written by
analysts  Naohiko Baba  and  Ilhyock Shim  and published in the
BIS’s quarterly review today.  
 The report may back up South Korea’s proposal for a
permanent arrangement for central banks to swap foreign
currencies to help address future funding shortages. The Group
of 20 nations refrained from endorsing the idea when they met in
Busan, South Korea, this month and Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
last month opposed it.  
 “This result has an important implication for the current
discussion in the G-20 on the strengthening global financial
safety net,” the report said. “Even though building up a large
amount of foreign reserves has certain merits as self-insurance,
once a country faces a foreign liquidity run, swap lines with
other central banks can have a powerful effect of complementing
the use of foreign reserves and thus stopping the run.”  
 Lehman Collapse  
 Following the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., Korean authorities used the country’s  foreign
reserves  to supply dollars to small companies and banks, who
were “completely shut off from the international market for U.S.
dollar funding,” the BIS said in the report.  
 The Bank of Korea entered a $30 billion swap deal with the
Fed a month later to provide dollars locally. That arrangement
expired in February.  
 Bank of Korea  Governor  Kim Choong Soo  said in a speech on
May 31 that a permanent swap arrangement could help establish a
worldwide financial safety net and reduce the need for emerging
economies to hoard foreign cash.  
 Bernanke said last month in Japan that while swap lines
played an important role in establishing stability during the
global financial crisis, “we don’t necessarily want to be
providing a permanent service for financial markets.” He said
authorities should instead press banks into better managing
their funding needs across different currencies.
