             Israel’s  trade  deficit widened in
May for the third month as the economy recovered from the global
crisis, lifting demand for imports.  
 The deficit, excluding polished diamonds, ships and
aircraft, was a seasonally adjusted $790 million compared with
a revised $201 million in the same month last year, the
 Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics  said on its website
today.  
 The trade gap is widening as the economy expands, boosting
demand for raw materials. Growth may reach 3.6 percent this year
with imports climbing 7.9 percent, the Finance Ministry said on
June 6.  
 Imports rose to $4.2 billion from $3.1 billion a year
earlier, the bureau said. Exports increased to $3.4 billion from
$2.9 billion.  
 Israel’s  benchmark  TA-25 stock index has surged about 25
percent in the past 12 months, led by Perrigo Co., the world’s
largest maker of non-prescription, store-branded drugs, which
more than doubled.
