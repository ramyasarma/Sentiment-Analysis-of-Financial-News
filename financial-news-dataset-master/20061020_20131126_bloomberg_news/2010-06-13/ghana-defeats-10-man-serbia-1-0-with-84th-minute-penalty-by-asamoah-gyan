             Ghana beat 10-man Serbia 1-0 in the
opening match of Group D at soccer’s World Cup today in
Pretoria, South Africa.  
 Asamoah Gyan scored from the penalty spot in the 84th
minute after Zdravko Kuzmanovic handled the ball. Serbia’s
Aleksandar Lukovic was dismissed 10 minutes earlier after
receiving a second yellow card.  
 Three-time tournament champion Germany plays Australia in
the same group later today. Earlier, Slovenia won 1-0 against
Algeria to move atop Group C.  
 Kuzmanovic handled as he stretched to cut out a cross in
the penalty area and Gyan fired the resulting spot-kick into the
net for the only goal.  
 Gyan almost added a second goal in injury time from a
breakaway, but his shot hit a post before rebounding to safety.
He also headed against the outside of a post earlier in the
half.  
 Ghana goalkeeper Richard Kingson, 32 today, palmed away
Serbia’s best opportunity by  Milos Krasic  after 79 minutes.
