             Five-time champion Roger Federer,
the top seed, was upset by Lleyton Hewitt in three sets in the
final of tennis’s Gerry Weber Open in Germany today. Sam Querrey
of the U.S. won the Aegon championships at Queen’s Club in
London.  
 Australia’s Hewitt was making his first appearance at the
Wimbledon grasscourt warmup event in Halle and won 3-6, 7-6 (7-
4), 6-4, the tournament website said.  
 It was his first victory against Federer since 2003, the
Swiss having won their last 15 matches. Hewitt hadn’t won a
tournament since Houston in April last year.  
 Federer lost to Sweden’s Robin Soderling in the French Open
quarterfinals in Paris on June 1, ending his record streak of 23
straight Grand Slam semifinals.  
 That meant he lost the ATP tour’s No. 1 status to Rafael
Nadal, who beat Soderling in the final in Paris.  
 At Queen’s Club, Querrey beat fellow American Mardy Fish 7-
6 (7-3), 7-5 in the final of the Aegon championships. Wimbledon
starts June 21.
