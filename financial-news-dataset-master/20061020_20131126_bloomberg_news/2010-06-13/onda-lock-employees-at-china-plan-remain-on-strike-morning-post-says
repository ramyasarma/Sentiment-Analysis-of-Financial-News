             Workers at a  Honda Motor Co.  parts
maker in southern China will stay on strike after rejecting a
pay raise offer, the South Morning China Post reported
today.  
 The strikers at Honda Lock (Guangdong) Co. disputed a claim
by a Honda Group representative that the labor dispute had been
settled, the newspaper reported.  
 Beijing-based Honda spokesman Zhu Linjie said yesterday the
strike at the plant had ended. Zhu declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News today.
