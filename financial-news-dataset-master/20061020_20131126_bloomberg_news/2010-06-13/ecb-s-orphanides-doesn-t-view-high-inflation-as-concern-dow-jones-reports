             European Central Bank council member
Athanasios Orphanides said he doesn’t see a risk of inflation as
projections “are quite benign,” in an interview with Dow Jones
Newswires published today.  
 “Core inflation in the euro area has been trending down,”
the news agency cited Orphanides as saying. “In light of these
developments, I do not view high inflation as a concern. Also,
and most importantly, inflation expectations over the medium to
long term have remained very well anchored, in line with our
objective of price stability.”  
 Orphanides also said “there is an element of absurdity in
talking about a high probability of default by the Greek
government,” according to Dow Jones. There is “concrete
evidence that the Greek government’s fiscal consolidation plan
is on track.” This is “evidence why one should be much more
confident about Greece today,” he is cited as saying.  
 The central banker said Europe needs to strengthen the
mechanism of fiscal surveillance and enforcement to make sure
monetary union members comply with the rules laid out, according
to the report.
