             Chevron Corp.  is investigating the
cause and size of an oil pipeline leak in the foothills of Salt
Lake City after shutting the line.  
 “Neither the source of the leak or the quantity of oil
released has been determined at this time,” said Chevron
spokesman Sean Comey in an e-mail statement. The company was
notified of the leak at around 8:20 p.m. U.S. central time
yesterday, and workers were dispatched to shut the line and
start containment of the spill, he said.  
 Initial estimates said around 500 barrels seeped from the
10-inch line that has a capacity of about 15,000 barrels a day,
according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for Mayor  Ralph Becker , citing Chevron data.  
 Chevron told Smith they shut the line yesterday and were
estimating a leak of about 50 gallons a minute before it was
turned off, she said.  
 Crews placed booms in waterways, including the Jordan
River, “to minimize downstream impact,” the mayor’s office
said in a release yesterday.  
 A boom was also laced in a drainage creek, said Comey.
“Wildlife rehabilitation experts have been engaged” and some
birds have been washed at the Salt Lake City zoo, he said.  
 The pipeline was carrying crude oil from Colorado into the
Salt Lake Valley to its  refinery , Smith said. Chevron’s Salt
Lake City plant can process 45,000 barrels a day of crude,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “They haven’t given a firm timeline on when they’ll
restart the line,” Smith said.
