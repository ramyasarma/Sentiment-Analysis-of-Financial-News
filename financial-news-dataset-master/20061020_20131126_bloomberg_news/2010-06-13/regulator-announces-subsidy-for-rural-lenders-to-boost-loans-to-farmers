             China’s finance ministry will
subsidize some rural lenders and banks operating in remote areas
in the nation’s west to boost lending to farmers, the banking
regulator said.  
 Rural banks, loan companies and rural-funding cooperatives,
the three new types of countryside lenders the regulator allowed
in 2006, will receive annual subsidies equivalent to 2 percent
of their average outstanding loans that year if lending grows
from the previous year, the China Banking Regulatory Commission
said in a  statement  on its website today.  
 Rural banks also need to have a loan balance that is more
than half of their deposits to qualify for the support, the
statement said.  
 Banking institutions operating in western towns and
villages, to be identified later by the bank regulator, will
also get the 2 percent fiscal subsidies, the statement said.
The rule takes effect immediately, the statement said.
