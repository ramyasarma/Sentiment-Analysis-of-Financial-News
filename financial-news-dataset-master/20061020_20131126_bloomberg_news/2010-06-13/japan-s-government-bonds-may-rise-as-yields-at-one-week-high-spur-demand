             Japan’s bonds may rise, ending two
days of losses, on speculation  10-year yields  near a one-week
high will encourage investors to buy the securities.  
 Ten-year Treasuries had their biggest gain in a week on
June 11 after a report showed U.S. retail sales unexpectedly
dropped. The Bank of Japan is forecast to keep interest rates
on hold at the end of a two-day policy meeting starting today.  
 “External factors have stopped deteriorating,” said
 Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Citigroup Global Markets
Japan Inc. in Tokyo. “We will see how much investors want to
buy bonds on dips.”  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery traded at
140.43 in London on June 11 from 140.34 at the 3 p.m. close at
the Tokyo Stock Exchange the same day. The contract will open
for trading at 9 a.m. Tokyo time.
