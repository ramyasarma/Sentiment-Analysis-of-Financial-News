             “The Karate Kid,” a remake of the
1984 martial-arts film, opened as the top-grossing movie in U.S.
and Canadian theaters this weekend with ticket sales of $55.7
million for  Sony Corp.   
 “The A-Team”  took second place with $25.7 million for
 News Corp. ’s Fox Film studio, researcher  Hollywood.com Box-
Office  said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 “The Karate Kid”  features  Jackie Chan  and Jaden Smith,
the son of actor  Will Smith . Chan plays Mr. Han, a Kung Fu
instructor. Pat Morita played an instructor named Mr. Miyagi in
the original film, which took in $90.8 million for Columbia
Pictures, according to Box Office Mojo, a researcher based in
Sherman Oaks, California.  
 “It blew past my expectations -- I thought it would finish
in the high twenties,” said  Gitesh Pandya , editor of Box Office
Guru LLC, in an interview. “Despite the fact that most people
look down on remakes, it was re-imagined for today’s generation
of young people.”  
 “The A-Team,” an update of the 1980s television series,
stars  Liam Neeson  as Hannibal Smith and mixed-martial arts
athlete Quinton “Rampage” Jackson as B.A. Baracus, the role
first played by Mr. T.  
 “ Shrek Forever After ,” from  DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. 
and  Viacom Inc. ’s Paramount Pictures, dropped to third place
with $15.8 million after three consecutive weekends on top.
“Shrek” is the fourth in the animated series and has generated
sales of $210 million since it was released.  
 ‘Killers’  
 “Get Him to the Greek” fell to fourth place from second
with sales of $9.9 million for Universal Pictures. The  Judd Apatow-produced  film stars Jonah Hill as a record-company intern
assigned to bring an out-of-control rock star, played by  Russell Brand , to Los Angeles from London in three days.  
 Dropping to fifth place from third was the  Ashton Kutcher 
comedy “Killers” in its second week of release with sales of
$8 million for Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.  
 Next weekend, “The Karate Kid” will be challenged by the
third installment of  Walt Disney Co.’s  “Toy Story” franchise,
a 3-D film from Disney’s Pixar animation unit. Pixar’s “Up”
had sales of $68.1 million in its debut weekend in May 2009, and
brought in $293 million domestically, according to
Hollywood.com.  
 Pixar  
 “It certainly has a good shot at beating ‘Up,’” Pandya
said. “It has 3-D ticket prices, and a more familiar brand.
Combine those two together and you have a good chance of the
biggest Pixar opening ever.”  
 Weekend sales for the top 12 films rose to $144.8 million
from $132 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Year-to-
date receipts total $4.68 billion, up 3.3 percent from $4.53
billion. Attendance has fallen 3 percent this year.
