             European banks had $254 billion of
loans to the governments of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain
at the end of 2009, according to figures from the  Bank for
International Settlements .  
 That represents only 16 percent of the banks’ overall
exposure to the four countries of $1.58 trillion, which includes
loans to individuals and companies, the Basel, Switzerland-based
BIS said in its latest quarterly review. French and German banks
had $493 billion and $465 billion respectively at risk in the
four countries, accounting for 61 percent of all euro area
lenders’ exposure, the BIS said.  
 “Government debt accounted for a smaller part of euro area
banks’ exposures to the countries facing market pressures than
claims on the private sector,” the BIS said in the report.
“French and German banks were particularly exposed to the
residents of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.”  
 The Bloomberg European Banks and Financial Services Index
of 52 lenders has dropped 10 percent in the past month on
concern the government bonds held by the lenders will plunge in
value, sparking further writedowns. A $1 trillion loan package
from European policy makers last month failed to erase concern
that Greece’s debt crisis will spread.  
 Banks in the region had $737 billion at stake in Spain,
$402 billion in Ireland, $244 billion in Portugal and $206
billion in Greece, the BIS said.
