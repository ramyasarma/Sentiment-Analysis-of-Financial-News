             Spirit Airlines Inc., a low-fare
carrier owned by private-equity firms Indigo Partners LLC and
Oaktree Capital Management LLC, canceled all flights through
June 15 after pilots went on strike yesterday.  
 Passengers scheduled to fly through June 15 would be
credited the full amount of their purchased tickets, plus $100
for future flights, the Miramar, Florida-based carrier said on
its website.  
 The walkout came after more than three years of
negotiations. Pilots said they are seeking pay on par with low-
fare competitors  JetBlue Airways Corp .,  AirTran Holdings Inc .
and  Southwest Airlines Co .  
 Spirit operates about 150 flights daily to 40 cities mostly
in the eastern U.S., Caribbean and Mexico. The airline and
pilots union negotiated every day in the week leading up to the
strike, including discussions June 11.
