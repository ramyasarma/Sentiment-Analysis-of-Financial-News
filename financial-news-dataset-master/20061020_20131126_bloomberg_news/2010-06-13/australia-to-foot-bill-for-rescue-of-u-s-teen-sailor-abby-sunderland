             Australia won’t ask Abby Sunderland,
the 16-year-old U.S. sailor attempting to circumnavigate the
world, to pay for rescue efforts made after her boat was
damaged in the middle of the Indian Ocean.  
 Sunderland was rescued yesterday by a French fishing boat
after three days adrift, more than 2,000 miles (3,220
kilometers) southwest of Perth. A  Qantas Airways Ltd .-owned
Airbus A330-300 was chartered by the government and dispatched
from Perth airport June 11. It located the missing sailor’s
vessel, leading to her rescue.  
 “That’s not the way the law works,” Transport Minister
 Anthony Albanese  said on the Ten television network today when
asked whether the government would expect Sunderland to pay for
her rescue. “The Australian taxpayer at the end of the day
makes a contribution.”  
 Sunderland experienced trouble after her Wild Eyes vessel
encountered winds of up to 60 knots and seas reaching 25 feet
(7.6 meters), according to her  website . She set off from Del
Rey Yacht Club in California on Jan. 23.  
 “There are plenty of things people can think of to blame
for my situation; my age, the time of year and many more,”
Sunderland said in a  blog entry  dated yesterday. “The truth is,
I was in a storm and you don’t sail through the Indian Ocean
without getting in at least one storm. As for age, since when
does age create gigantic waves and storms?”  
 Australian Jessica Watson, also 16, completed a seven-
month solo trip around the world when she sailed into Sydney
Harbour on May 15.
