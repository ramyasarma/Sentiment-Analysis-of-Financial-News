             Prime Minister  David Cameron 
appointed  David Young , a former U.K. minister in  Margaret Thatcher ’s government, to advise him on a revamp of health and
safety rules to curb their abuse in legal claims.  
 “The rise of the compensation culture over the last 10
years is a real concern, as is the way health and safety rules
are sometimes applied,” Cameron said today in a statement. “We
need a sensible new approach that makes clear these laws are
intended to protect people, not overwhelm businesses with red
tape. I look forward to receiving  Lord Young ’s recommendations
on how we can best achieve that.”  
 Young will advise Cameron in coming months on how safety
legislation can be improved to prevent it from becoming an
unnecessary burden on companies, Cameron’s Downing Street office
said in the statement. Young became a cabinet minister in 1984
and left Thatcher’s government in 1989 when he was secretary of
state for trade and industry.  
 “Health and safety regulation is essential in many
industries but may well have been applied too generally and have
become an unnecessary burden on firms, but also community
organizations and public services,” Young said in the
statement. “I hope my review will reintroduce an element of
common sense and focus the regulation where it is most needed.
We need a system that is proportionate and not bureaucratic.”
