             Crude oil advanced in New York,
extending gains made last week, on speculation sustained growth
in the U.S. economy will boost fuel demand from the world’s
biggest energy consumer.  
 Oil climbed for the fourth time in five days before reports
this week that may show U.S. factories churned out more goods
last month and the cost of living declined. These could point to
a manufacturing-led recovery that isn’t generating inflation,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The dollar
dropped to its lowest level in a week against the euro,
bolstering the investment appeal of commodities.  
 “Fundamentals are getting better and the euro is also
driving the crude market,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity
derivative-sales manager at broker Newedge in Tokyo. “On the 
downside, the market is well supported above $73 at the moment.”  
 Crude oil for July delivery rose as much as $1.14, or 1.6
percent, to $74.92 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was at $74.79 at 2:54 p.m.
Singapore time. Futures increased 3.2 percent last week and are
up 5.8 percent from a year ago.  
 Production at U.S. factories, mines and utilities increased
in May for the 10th time in 11 months, according to the median
estimate from 63 economists polled by Bloomberg News before
Federal Reserve figures due June 16. Consumer prices probably
declined 0.2 percent in May, after slipping 0.1 percent the
previous month, the survey showed.  
 Oil fell June 11 after the Commerce Department said U.S.
retail sales decreased 1.2 percent in May, the biggest drop
since September.  
 Dollar Falls  
 The dollar declined against the euro for the fourth time in
five days. The common currency gained as much as 0.8 percent to
$1.2208, the highest since June 4.  
 A European Union report today may show industrial output in
the 16-nation region expanded 0.5 percent in April from March,
when it increased a revised 1.6 percent, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 On June 11, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary  consumer sentiment  index for the U.S. rose to 75.5
for June from 73.6 last month. That’s the highest since January
2008, beating a median 74.5 estimate from economists polled by
Bloomberg News.  
 U.S.  gasoline inventories  dropped to the lowest level this
year at the start of the summer peak demand season, an Energy
Department report showed June 9. Stockpiles fell to 219 million
barrels in the week ended June 4, 5.3 percent above the five-
year average.  
 “There’s no shortage,” said Hasegawa at Newedge. “The
situation is much better than before, although I still cannot
say it’s very strong at the moment.”  
 Futures Bets  
 Brent crude oil for July delivery rose as much as 98 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $75.33 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was at $75.21 a barrel at 2:52 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract increased 3.1 percent last week.  
 Concerns about the viability of the U.S. economic rebound
have led hedge funds to cut their bets on higher oil-futures
prices to a 10-month low.  
 Speculative  net-long positions , or wagers that prices will
increase, in crude futures declined 30 percent to 17,457
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the week ended
June 8, the lowest level since July, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders Report
released on June 11. Bets on gains have dropped 87 percent since
reaching a record 135,669 in January.
