             Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s
biggest economy, expects revenue from tourism to increase 4.8
percent in 2010 as the kingdom tries to attract more visitors
and religious pilgrims, the official  Saudi Press Agency  said.  
 Tourism revenue will reach 66 billion riyals ($17.6
billion) and rise to 118 billion riyals in 2015, the Riyadh-
based news service said, citing Saleh al-Bakhit, the deputy-
chairman for investments at the  Saudi Commission for Tourism &
Antiquities .  
 Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and the world’s
biggest oil exporter, wants to develop its tourism industry as
it tries to diversify its economy away from oil and create
employment for its youth. Saudi Arabia is building a $5.3
billion rail line that can transport 3 million people between
Mecca and Medina and is expanding Jeddah international airport
to handle 30 million passengers by 2012.  
 Saudi nationals represented 117,384 of the 457,658 people
employed by the tourism industry at the end of 2009, the Saudi
Press Agency said, citing al-Bakhit.  
 The Riyadh-based tourism commission wants to attract more
investment and will start a development company to identify new
opportunities in the kingdom, al-Bakhit said, according to the
news service. The government will allow long-term land leases
for tourism projects, he said.  
 Jabal Omar Development Co. , a real-estate developer in
Mecca, is building 27 hotels with a combined 15,000 rooms. The
first will open in 2011.  Kingdom Holding Co.,  the investment
company controlled by billionaire Prince Alwaleed, plans to open
a five-star hotel with 1,000 rooms, restaurants and retail space
in Islam’s holiest city.  
 Saudi Arabia receives at least 2 million visitors a year
from 160 countries for the annual pilgrimage, or hajj, to Mecca.
The commission also wants to promote its Red Sea coastline and
historical sites, including  Madain Saleh  and Souq Okaz, as
tourist destinations, al-Bakhit said.
