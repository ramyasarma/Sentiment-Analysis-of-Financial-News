             Japan may set up a public-private
entity to help Japanese companies win smart-grid infrastructure
contracts overseas, Nikkei English News said, without citing
anyone.   
 The government may provide as much as 30 billion yen in
funding to the entity and private companies may provide a
similar amount, the report said.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd., Toshiba Corp. and Fuji Electric Holdings Co. are
considering taking part, the report said.
