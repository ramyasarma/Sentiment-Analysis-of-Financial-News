Beiersdorf AG , the Nivea skin-cream
maker, fell the most in more than 18 months in Frankfurt trading
after  saying  it expects profitability to decrease in 2011 and
that it sees no sales growth at its consumer unit next year.  The  shares  fell 5.7 percent, the  biggest drop  since April
2009. They fell 5.2 percent on Dec. 10 when the Hamburg-based
company lowered its 2010 margin forecast because of costs for
revamping its consumer unit.  Beiersdorf said today it expects earnings before interest
and taxes as a percentage of sales to decline next year from the
2010 level as it steps up marketing behind its Nivea brand
“significantly.” The company is looking to countries including
China for growth to offset falling demand in Europe. In an
investor presentation posted on its website, Beiersdorf also
said it expects sales in 2011 to be “level” with 2010.  “Beiersdorf is struggling with declining sales in its key
skincare categories,” analysts including  Chas Manso de Zuniga 
and  Warren Ackerman  at Evolution Securities in London wrote in a
note dated Dec. 13. “It is reallocating resources away from its
weaker beauty categories to prop up skincare and its other
stronger categories. The chances of 2011 seeing much like-for-
like growth in the consumer division are shrinking.”  Also last week, Beiersdorf reduced its target for 2010
sales growth at the consumer unit and said its finance director
would step down. About  95 percent  of operating profit comes from
the division, which sells hair- and skin-care products.  The  shares  fell 2.51 euros to 41.20 euros as of the 5:30
p.m. close of trading. Beiersdorf has fallen 10 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
