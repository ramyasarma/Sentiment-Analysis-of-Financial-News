Nereus Capital , headed by a former
director at D.E. Shaw & Co., received an investment from U.S.
asset manager  Northern Lights Capital Group LLC  to target
renewable-energy projects in India.  India is forecast to spend $30 billion on renewable energy
over the next decade, creating opportunities for investments,
the companies said in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  Nereus is considering investments in independent power
producers including developers of wind, solar, biomass and
hydropower projects, Nereus said in an e-mailed response to
questions. The private-equity firm invests from $5 million to
$35 million per project, it said.  Inefficiencies in the Indian power industry have created
high prices for electricity, making many renewable projects
economical without government incentives or substantial debt,
the joint statement said.  Nereus was founded by  Jonathan Winer , former director of
the Indian private-equity practice of D.E. Shaw, the $20 billion
asset manager founded by David Shaw, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
