Macau will stop granting land for
casino projects without public tenders, the Macau Daily Times
said, citing Jaime Carion, director of the Land, Public Works
and Transport Bureau.  The city is revising the Land Law to provide a more
explicit definition of “public interest,” the English-language
Macau-based newspaper reported today. As the government is
seeking to broaden the local economy away from gambling, casinos
will no longer qualify for this exemption from site-sale rules,
the Daily Times said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
