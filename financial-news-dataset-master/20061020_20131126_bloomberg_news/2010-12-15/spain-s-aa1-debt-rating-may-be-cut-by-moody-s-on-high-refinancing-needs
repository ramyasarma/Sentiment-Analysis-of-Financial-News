Spain had its Aa1 local and foreign
currency government bond ratings placed on review for possible
downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service.  The ratings company cited Spain’s “vulnerability to
funding stress given its high refinancing needs in 2011,”
according to a statement today.  Moody’s also sees for Spain a “potential further increase
in the public debt ratio should the cost of bank
recapitalization prove to be higher than expected so far.”  There are “increased concerns over the ability of the
Spanish government to achieve the required sustainable and
structural improvement in general government finances given the
limits of central government control over the regional
governments’ finances,” Moody’s said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
