Twitter Inc. said it’s valued at
$3.7 billion after receiving a $200 million round of funding led
by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.  The company also added two directors to its board, Chief
Executive Officer  Dick Costolo  said in a  blog post . Twitter
spokesman Matt Graves provided the valuation in an e-mailed
statement.  Twitter, which has more than 175 million users, can use the
funds to hire more people for its advertising service, which 
began earlier this year. The San Francisco-based company started
in 2006 and has more than 350 employees, up from 130 a year ago.  “The additional resources and expertise will be extremely
helpful as Twitter continues to grow as a company and business,”
said Costolo, who became CEO in October, replacing co-founder
 Evan Williams .  Joining the board are  Mike McCue , chief executive officer
of social magazine Flipboard, and  David Rosenblatt , former CEO
of DoubleClick Inc. Rosenblatt also served as a president at
Google Inc. after that company bought DoubleClick in 2008.  Twitter raised $100 million in September 2009, when it had
about 25 million users. That round included T. Rowe Price Group
Inc., Insight Venture Partners, Spark Capital and Institutional
Venture Partners. The valuation was about $1 billion, a person
familiar with the matter said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
