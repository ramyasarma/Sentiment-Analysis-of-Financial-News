The U.S. Senate has enough votes to
pass an $858 billion tax-cut agreement between President  Barack Obama  and Republicans that would extend Bush-era tax reductions
for all income levels.  The vote is continuing. Approval would send the bill to the
House, where Democratic leaders may bring it to the floor as
early as today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
