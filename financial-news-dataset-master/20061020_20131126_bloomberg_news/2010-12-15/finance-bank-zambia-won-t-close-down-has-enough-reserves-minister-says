Finance Bank Zambia Ltd., the
country’s biggest privately owned lender that is under central
bank supervision, isn’t at risk of closing down, Finance
Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane  said.  The bank has enough assets and cash to meet “any above-
normal” withdrawals and the government will boost the lender’s
reserves further if needed, Musokotwane told reporters today in
the capital, Lusaka. The government isn’t considering
nationalizing the bank, he said.  “If the funds run out the government shall meet the
deficit,” Musokotwane said. “This is just a corrective measure
and not a permanent takeover.”  Customers of Finance Bank, partly owned by  Credit Suisse
Group AG , withdrew $75 million from the bank since the central
bank took it over on Oct. 10, the Lusaka-based Post newspaper
reported, citing unidentified Finance Bank officials.  Bank of Zambia appointed  FirstRand Ltd.  of South Africa to
manage the bank after accusing the Zambian lender of breaching
financial laws. FirstRand is to investigate the alleged breach
and make recommendations on how to proceed.  Zambia’s high court is to decide on Dec. 27 whether to
overturn the central bank’s takeover of the lender, John Sangwa,
a lawyer acting for Finance Bank, said by phone from Lusaka.  “There are two applications we have made to the high
court,” he said. “We want them to remove the running of the
bank from FirstRand of South Africa and to not proceed with any
possible sale of the bank and its assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
