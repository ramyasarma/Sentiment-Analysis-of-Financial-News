DBS Group Holdings Ltd ., Southeast
Asia’s biggest bank, said it will take over Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s retail and commercial banking businesses in
China.  RBS  will transfer close to 25,000 clients in Shanghai,
Beijing and Shenzhen to DBS China, Singapore-based DBS said in a
 statement  today. DBS didn’t spend any money on the deal,  Melvin Teo , chief executive officer of DBS China, said at a news
conference in Shanghai.  DBS Chief Executive Officer  Piyush Gupta , seeking to lift a
stock that’s trailed rivals in 2010, said last month he plans to
improve return on equity by building businesses that cater to
wealthy individuals and small companies, and by expanding in
China, India and Indonesia. For RBS, the deal is part of asset
disposals following a government bailout and  record losses .  “There’s a bit of momentum there for selling fringe
assets,” said  Mike Trippitt , a London-based analyst at Oriel
Securities Ltd. who has a “buy” rating on RBS. The deal “is
good in terms of sentiment,” he said.  Singapore-based DBS aims to generate about 40 percent of
revenue from the city state in five years, down from about two-
thirds now, according to a plan unveiled in February. Greater
China would make up 30 percent, DBS has said. South Asia and the
rest of Southeast Asia may contribute another 30 percent.  The transaction with RBS, if all accounts choose to move,
will add $900 million of deposits to DBS China and lower its
loan-to-deposit ratio to about 70 percent from the current 79
percent, Teo said. He said RBS wanted to exit the retail and
commercial banking businesses so DBS took them over for free.  Still in China  RBS will continue to provide wholesale banking services to
large companies and institutional clients in China, the
Edinburgh-based firm said in a statement today. Plans to set up
a brokerage in the country were approved and China remains a
“core market,” it said.  DBS fell 0.9 percent to S$13.90 in Singapore trading today,
extending this year’s losses to 9.7 percent. RBS dropped 0.4
percent to 41.16 pence at 9:46 a.m. in London.  China opened its banking industry to overseas companies in
December 2006, sparking a rush among foreign lenders to compete
for the nation’s corporate and household savings, which reached
$8 trillion in September. The country’s loan growth averaged 20
percent from 2005 to 2009, according to the central bank.  The number of high net worth individuals in the nation
increased 31 percent to 477,000 last year, according to a survey
by Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. That has
attracted the world’s top managers of assets for the rich,
including UBS AG.  Branch Growth  DBS plans to have 50 branches in China from the 16 outlets
within three years, Gupta said last month. It plans to double
staff in the country to 2,000 by early 2012, Chief Financial
Officer  Chng Sok Hui  said at a press briefing in Singapore today.
The lender has grown its customer base in China more than five
times over the past three years, according to today’s statement.  RBS Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  is shrinking the
bank’s balance sheet after it received the world’s biggest
banking bailout in 2008. It has since pared non-core assets by
90 billion pounds ($141 billion) to 174 billion pounds, the firm
said in June, and plans to sell the remainder by 2013.  RBS sold its Indian commercial and consumer division to
HSBC Holdings Plc in July for $95 million after disposing of
units in Argentina, Kazakhstan, Pakistan and the United Arab
Emirates. The firm sold its businesses in Singapore, Taiwan,
Indonesia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Vietnam to  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  for $550 million in August 2009.  -- Luo Jun ,  Joyce Koh . With assistance from  Kevin Crowley  in
