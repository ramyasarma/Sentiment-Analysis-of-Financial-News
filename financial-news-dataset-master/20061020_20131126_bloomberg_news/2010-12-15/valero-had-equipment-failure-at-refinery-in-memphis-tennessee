Valero Energy Corp.  said equipment
failure at its Memphis, Tennessee, refinery activated an
emergency flare and released sulfur dioxide.  The 195,000-barrel-a-day plant “reported flaring, but that
was not associated with any impact to production,” said  Bill Day , a company spokesman.  Valero reported 653 pounds of the gas was released into the
atmosphere at 7:45 p.m. local time yesterday, according to a
 filing  to the National Response Center. The equipment has been
fixed, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
