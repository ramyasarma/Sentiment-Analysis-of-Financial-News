Spain approved 919 developers to
build 121 megawatts of new photovoltaic power plants that will
receive consumer subsidies, accepting one of every five bids
because the government wants to slow solar power’s growth rate.  The Industry Ministry said today that 4,354 applications
were submitted for approval, or registration, in the fourth
quarter. The pace was little changed from the first nine months,
during which the government granted requests from 2,675
developers to set up arrays of solar panels.  Project managers approved in the latest quarterly round of
tenders have 12 months to install and connect their plants in
order to claim the subsidies, which are added to consumer bills
and are incentives to spur clean-energy production in a nation
that imports more than 98 percent of its oil and natural gas.  The ministry comment on the results in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
