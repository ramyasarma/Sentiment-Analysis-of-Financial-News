Malaysia’s Islamic bond funds say
returns, which fell 40 percent this year, will improve in 2011
as the government’s $444 billion development plan attracts
international investors and spurs trading.  “I’m quite confident we can beat this year’s
performance,” said  Nor Hanifah Hashim , who helps oversee 25
billion ringgit ($8 billion) at Kuala Lumpur-based CIMB-
Principal Asset Management Bhd., whose  CIMB Enhanced Sukuk Fund 
was the second-best performer. “I don’t think foreign investors
will stop pouring money into the region next year.”  The 32 Malaysian funds tracked by Bloomberg returned an
average 3.8 percent this year as of Dec. 14 versus 6.4 percent
in 2009. They lagged the 9.2 percent return in Indonesia and 8.3
percent for Pakistan. Performance worsened for 23 of the funds.  The 10-year government initiative for private-led projects
ranging from a nuclear power plant to an underground rail
network will spur sales of Shariah-compliant debt, according to
RHB Investment Management Sdn., manager of the country’s third-
best performing fund. Issuance in Malaysia, which accounts for
more than 50 percent of the $144 billion Islamic bonds
outstanding worldwide, fell 30 percent in 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Strong Catalyst’  “The economic transformation program is a very strong
catalyst,”  Sharifatul Hanizah Said Ali , who oversees 12.2
billion ringgit as chief executive officer of RHB Investment,
said in an interview from Kuala Lumpur yesterday. “The
opportunity to outperform will prevail in the conventional and
Islamic” bond markets, she said. RHB’s Islamic Bond Fund has
gained 9.5 percent, up from 5.8 percent in 2009.  The  PB Islamic Bond Fund  managed by Public Mutual Bhd.
topped returns in Malaysia, gaining 10.1 percent versus last
year’s 8.7 percent. CIMB Enhanced Sukuk returned 9.7 percent
compared with 15.4 percent in 2009.  Lum Ming Jang , Public
Mutual’s senior manager of investment, declined to comment in an
e-mailed reply to questions on Dec. 14.  Sales of Shariah-compliant debt in Malaysia dropped this
year as companies curtailed investment following last year’s
recession, the country’s first in a decade. Issuance fell to
22.4 billion ringgit, from 32 billion ringgit in the same period
of 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Global sales of sukuk,
which pay asset returns to comply with the religion’s ban on
interest, declined 28 percent to $14.5 billion.  “It would be hard to replicate the outstanding returns of
2009 as credit spreads have narrowed remarkably in a dislocated
market brought by the recent global financial crisis,”  Wan Murezani Mohamad , a senior analyst at Malaysian Rating Corp.,
said in an interview from Kuala Lumpur on Dec. 14.  Annual Return  Islamic bonds  returned  11.7 percent this year, compared
with 20 percent in 2009, according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai U.S.
Dollar Sukuk Index. Developing market debt gained 11.8 percent
since Dec. 31, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Diversified
 Index  shows.  The  difference  between the average yield for sukuk and the
London interbank offered rate narrowed 47 basis points, or 0.47
percentage point, this month to 314, and is down 154 basis
points in 2010, according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US Dollar
Sukuk Index.  The yield on Malaysia’s 3.928 percent dollar-denominated
Islamic note due June 2015 climbed 36 basis points this month to
3.23 percent, according to prices provided by Royal Bank of
Scotland Group. The premium investors demand to hold Dubai’s
government sukuk rather than Malaysia’s narrowed 62 basis points
to 336 since November, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Planned Sales  Malaysia’s Finance Minister  Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah  told
reporters in Kuala Lumpur on Sept. 28 that 19 development
projects worth 151 billion ringgit are due to start early next
year. The additional spending will help sustain growth of as
much as 6 percent in 2011, compared with an estimated 6 percent
to 7 percent this year, he said.  Government bond sales may rise next year because of an
increase in maturing debt compared with 2010, according to a
research report from CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. on Dec. 13.
Issuance of Islamic and non-Shariah-compliant notes may climb to
90.5 billion ringgit, 50 percent more than gross borrowing this
year, the report said.  Malaysia Debt Ventures Bhd., a venture capital firm owned
by the Ministry of Finance, plans to sell as much as 500 million
ringgit of sukuk in September or October next year, Chief
Executive Officer  Md. Zubir Ansori Yahaya  said in an interview
in Kuala Lumpur on Sept. 28. The company sold 500 million
ringgit of Islamic bonds in August.  Ringgit Gains  Speculation the ringgit will extend this year’s best annual
performance since 1973 may also attract more international
investors to domestic bonds and boost returns in 2011, according
to Malaysian Rating.  The currency appreciated 9.1 percent against the dollar,
the third-biggest gain in Asia behind the Thai baht and the yen,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Foreign funds are expected to continue providing support
in the local bond market as their bets on a strengthening local
currency look unlikely to fade in the near future,” said Wan at
Malaysian Rating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
