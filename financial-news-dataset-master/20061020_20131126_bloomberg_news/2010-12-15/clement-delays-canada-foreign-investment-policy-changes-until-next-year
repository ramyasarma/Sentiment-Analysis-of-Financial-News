Canadian Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said today he won’t issue guidelines on foreign
investment rules this year as he had earlier pledged, opting
instead to propose legislative changes next year.  Clement had said he would clarify how the government
evaluates foreign takeovers after rejecting  BHP Billiton Ltd .’s
$40 billion bid for  Potash Corp . of Saskatchewan Inc. last
month. Under the  Investment Canada Act , the government can block
any transaction valued at C$299 million ($297 million) or more
if it finds the deal doesn’t provide a “net benefit” to the
country.  “Upon reflection, because we are looking at some changes
to the ICA and we want the Industry Committee to do its work,
we’re going to roll everything into the new year,” Clement told
reporters in Ottawa. “I’d like to see some changes, and the
 Prime Minister  would like to see some changes, to give the
minister of industry more power and authority to talk about
these deals without violating the Act.”  Parliament voted to have a committee review the current
legislation after Clement’s decision, which was only the second
blocked transaction since the law was implemented 25 years ago.
Clement said he will choose among the committee’s
recommendations for legislative changes.  Clement has repeatedly said the current law doesn’t allow
him to provide details on negotiations with acquiring companies
or the commitments they make to gain approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
