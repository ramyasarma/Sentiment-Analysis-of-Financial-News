Chrysler Group LLC is recalling
367,350 Town and Country and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans in the
U.S., citing air bags that may inadvertently deploy.  Water leaks in the 2008 model year minivans may cause a
warning light to illuminate and the air bags to inflate, Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler said in a voluntary recall notice
posted on the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration’s website today.  The leaks are caused by improperly assembled heating and
cooling system drain grommets, Chrysler said. Those parts were
made by BRC Rubber & Plastics Inc., according to the automaker.
Representatives of BRC, based in Churubusco, Indiana, didn’t
immediately respond to a request for comment.  “Some vehicles may have an improperly installed HVAC hose
grommet that could cause moisture to collect on the floor and
damage the air bag deployment module,”  Vince Muniga , a
spokesman for Chrysler, which is operated by  Fiat SpA , said in
an e-mail. “The company is not aware of any accidents or
fatalities resulting from this issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
