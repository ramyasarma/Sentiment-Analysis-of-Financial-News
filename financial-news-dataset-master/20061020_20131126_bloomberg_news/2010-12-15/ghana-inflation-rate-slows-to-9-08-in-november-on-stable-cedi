Ghana’s  inflation slowed in November
as stability in the local currency offset pressure from
increased government spending.  Inflation declined to 9.1 percent from 9.4 percent in
October, Ebo Duncan, a statistician with the Ghana Statistical
Service, told reporters today in the capital, Accra.  “Although we’ve seen sizeable wage and tariff increases
going through this year, this has been offset to some extent by
FX stability and less-than-trend growth,” said  Razia Khan , head
of Africa research for  Standard Chartered Plc  in London.  The inflation rate has fallen from a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009, as the currency gained more than 4 percent
against the dollar in the period. The cedi is likely to remain
between 1.41 and 1.45 in 2011,  Stephen Bailey-Smith , an analyst
at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said Nov. 30. It gained 0.3 percent
to 1.4585 per dollar at 1:30 p.m. local time, according to
Bloomberg data.  Food-price growth slowed to 5.3 percent in November, from
5.6 percent a month earlier. Non-food prices rose an annual 11.5
percent, down from 11.8 percent.  Inflation is likely to remain below 10 percent in December,
Duncan said. A survey of consumer markets this month shows
little change in prices for staple foods such as corn, he said.  Slowing inflation has enabled the central bank to cut its
key interest rate by 4.5 percentage points this year. The last
reduction in July took the rate to 13.5 percent from 15 percent.  The currency’s stability may bring inflation below 9
percent next year, Bank of Ghana Governor  Kwesi Amissah-Arthur 
said on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
