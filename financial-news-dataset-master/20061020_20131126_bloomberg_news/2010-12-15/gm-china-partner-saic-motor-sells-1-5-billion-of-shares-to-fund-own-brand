SAIC Motor Corp.  completed a private
share placement that raised 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) for
China’s largest domestic carmaker to help it develop own-brand
and new energy vehicles.  Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp., the company’s parent,
agreed to buy about 10 percent of the 720.98 million shares in
the placement for about 1 billion yuan, Shanghai-based SAIC said
in a statement to the city’s stock exchange today.  SAIC, the partner of  General Motors Co.  and  Volkswagen AG ,
also plans to expand a technology center to compete against
foreign rivals including Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.
in China, which surpassed the U.S. in auto sales last year. The
Chinese government is encouraging domestic automakers to develop
their own brands and alternative-energy technology.  SAIC  fell 0.9 percent to 17.05 yuan in Shanghai at the
11.30 a.m. trading break. The stock has declined 15 percent this
year, compared with an 11 percent drop in the benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index.  While most of SAIC’s vehicles are made with GM and
Volkswagen, the automaker aims to sell 180,000 of its own-brand
vehicles this year, President  Chen Hong  said in March. SAIC owns
the design rights to MG Rover’s Rover 25 and Rover 75 cars, and
renamed the Rover cars in China as Roewe after taking over the
rights in 2005.  -- Liza Lin . Editors:  Garry Smith ,  Suresh Seshadri .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
