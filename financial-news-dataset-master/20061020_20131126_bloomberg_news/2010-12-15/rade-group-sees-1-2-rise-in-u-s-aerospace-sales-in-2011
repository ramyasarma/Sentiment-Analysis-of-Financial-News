Aerospace sales in the U.S. may rise
about 1.2 percent next year, aided by growing demand for
commercial aircraft as military orders come under pressure due
to federal  budget deficits , an industry trade group said today.  Sales may increase to $219.2 billion next year from an
estimated $216.5 billion in this year, the  Aerospace Industries
Association  said in its year-end review and annual forecast. A
4.2 percent increase in commercial airplane sales in 2011 is
projected to offset weak orders for military aircraft, missiles
and space equipment, the group said.  “Looming discussions over how to trim the nation’s deficit
are ominous clouds over a large portion of the industry’s
federal sales” including military contracts, said the group,
whose members include  Lockheed Martin Corp . and  Boeing Co .
Commercial sales “will benefit as the pent-up demand for new,
fuel-efficient aircraft is fulfilled.”  Defense spending, which accounts for 56 percent of the
annual U.S. federal discretionary budget, is being targeted for
cuts as a way to reduce the deficit. The bi-partisan  National
Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform  in its final
report recommends  weapons cuts , including aircraft, that would
cumulatively save more than $31.2 billion through 2015,
including $19 billion in the year 2015 alone.  Estimated overall industry sales growth of less than 1
percent this year from 2009 would mark the seventh straight
increase, without adjusting for inflation, the association said.
The industry’s annual growth rate has slowed from 7.13 percent
in 2009, and inflation-adjusted sales declined over the past two
years.  Aerospace Orders  Aerospace orders rose 16.4 percent to $195.7 billion in
2010, the group said, citing preliminary figures. Industry
backlog will increase slightly this year to $421.5 billion after
declining in 2009, the association said.  Exports  this year declined slightly from 2009 to $80.5
billion, while still generating a trade surplus of $53.3
billion, the group said.  Employment in the industry may fall 3 percent to 624,200
jobs this year compared with 644,200 last year, the association
said.  Sales of military aircraft including fighters, transports
and helicopters may rise in 2011 by about $137 million, or 2.1
percent, to $65.8 billion, the trade group said.  “Military aircraft sales have nearly doubled since 2000,
but this breakneck pace is likely to ease considerably in the
coming years,” the group said.  Civil aircraft sales will increase next year by 4.2 percent
to $50.2 billion, the association predicts.  Missile sales will decline 1.7 percent in 2011, while
space-sector revenue will decline less than 1 percent, the
association said.  The Aerospace Industries Association represents the
nation’s major aerospace manufacturers including the five
largest military contractors: Lockheed Martin, Boeing,  Northrop
Grumman Corp .,  General Dynamics  and  Raytheon Co . and commercial
companies such as  General Electric Co .  To contact the reporter on this story:
