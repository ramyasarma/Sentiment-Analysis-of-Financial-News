The U.K.’s upper, unelected, House
of Lords voted to let universities triple tuition fees, backing
a decision by the lower House of Commons last week.  Police formed a protective cordon around  Parliament  in
London yesterday before lawmakers voted on the plans, which will
allow colleges to charge students 9,000 pounds ($14,200) a year
for tuition from 2012. The upper chamber defeated two amendments
put forward by the opposition Labour Party by 283 votes to 215,
and by 273 votes to 200.  Following the vote in the Commons on Dec. 9, demonstrators
attempted to smash their way into the Treasury and attacked a
car carrying  Prince Charles  and his wife  Camilla  through central
London. There were no reports of incidents before yesterday’s
voting.  The riots were the first taste of protests that may
increase as Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government pushes
through its plans to cut the  record budget deficit . A total of
39 people were arrested following the Dec. 9 demonstrations,
according to the Metropolitan Police. More than 30 police
officers and 43 protesters were injured, Home Secretary  Theresa May  told the Commons two days ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
