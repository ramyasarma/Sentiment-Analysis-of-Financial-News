Michael Vick , who received a 23-
month prison sentence in a 2007 dogfighting case before joining
the Philadelphia Eagles, would someday like to own another dog,
he told TheGrio.com.  “I would love to have another dog in the future,” Vick
said in an interview posted on the  website . “It would be a big
step for me in the rehabilitation process, just to have a pet in
my household and show people that I genuinely care.”  The judge who sentenced Vick in December 2007 banned him
from owning a dog again, according to ESPN.  “If I have that opportunity again, I’ll never take it for
granted,” Vick said.  Vick left prison in May 2009 and has since been working
with the Humane Society to speak out against dogfighting.  He signed with the Eagles before the 2009 National Football
League season and is now the team’s starting quarterback, with
17 touchdown passes and four interceptions this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
