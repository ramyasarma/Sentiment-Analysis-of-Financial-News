Copper declined as some investors
sold the metal to lock in gains after it climbed to a record
yesterday, and as the appeal of commodities as alternative
investments was diminished by a stronger dollar.  Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
fell as much as 0.7 percent to $9,101.50 a metric ton, and
traded at $9,105.50 at 3:05 p.m. in Singapore. Copper, which
peaked at $9,267.50 a ton yesterday, rose as much as 0.9 percent
earlier today. Zinc, lead and nickel also dropped.  “We’re bound to run into bouts of profit-taking but
nothing has altered on the fundamental front and investors are
still looking for the world to be short of copper,” said Chen
Wenbin, an analyst at International Trade Futures Co. “We’re
also getting the dollar and equities weighing on commodities.”  The Federal Reserve yesterday kept with a plan to expand
record stimulus, boosting the dollar against a six-currency
basket including the euro. Asian equities dropped after U.S.
policy makers said that the country’s economic expansion hasn’t
been strong enough to reduce unemployment.  The metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost as much as 1.1 percent to 68,030 yuan ($10,216) a
ton, while futures on the Comex in New York dropped as much as 1
percent to $4.1665 a pound.  Copper Shortage  At least 90 percent of the copper in warehouses monitored
by the LME is being held by a single, unidentified company,
bourse data show. The so-called dominant position, indicated in
the Warrant Cash Banding Report, is “not unusual,” according
to Diarmuid O’Hegarty, LME deputy chief executive.  “I highly doubt it’s one player trying to squeeze the
market,” said  Ji Xianglong , an analyst at Xinhua Futures Co.
“It could tighten short-term supply but the outlook for the
longer term is for a shortage anyway and that’s what’s driving
prices to record levels.”  Analysts including those at UBS AG and  Standard Chartered
Plc  are forecasting higher copper prices on expectations of a
shortfall. UBS this week raised its 2011 estimate to $4.15 a
pound ($9,150 a ton) from $3.68, while Standard Chartered
boosted its forecast for next year to $8,825 a ton from $8,375.  The copper shortage will more than double to 500,000 tons
in 2011, from a deficit of 200,000 tons this year, according to
BNP Paribas SA, which also forecast a shortage in 2012.  Aluminum in London fell 0.2 percent to $2,345.25 a ton,
zinc decreased 1.1 percent to $2,275 a ton and lead declined 1.7
percent to $2,408 a ton. Nickel shed 0.8 percent to $24,297 a
ton, while tin dropped 1.2 percent to $25,940 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
