Westpac Banking Corp.  said demand
for loans in Australia and New Zealand is likely to improve in
2011 after the company’s fiscal year started “with sound
momentum.”  “Borrowers remain cautious and growth will not be evenly
distributed across industries or regions,” Westpac Chief
Executive Officer  Gail Kelly  said in a prepared speech for
today’s annual general meeting. The first three months of the
financial year ending Sept. 30 “show no surprises,” she said.  Australia’s largest banks have said a rebound in domestic
credit demand has taken longer than expected after Europe’s debt
crisis and doubts over the global economy held back investment.
Sydney-based Westpac, the country’s second-largest bank, is also
facing proposed government reforms to increase competition.  The bank said today it will support the objective of the
proposals and will consult with Treasurer Wayne Swan.  Westpac  climbed  0.5 percent to A$23.12 at 10:47 a.m. in
Sydney trading. The stock is down 8.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
