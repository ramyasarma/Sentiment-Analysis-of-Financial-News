South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest
crude importer, expects to increase production from oil and gas
fields owned by its energy companies by 33 percent next year
through the acquisition of overseas assets.  Production may rise to 409,000 barrels a day of oil
equivalent next year from 308,000 barrels a day this year, the
 Ministry of Knowledge Economy  said today in its 2011 policy
plan. South Korea, which imports almost all its energy needs,
shipped in 837.1 million barrels of crude and 25.8 million
metric tons of gas in 2009.  State-run  Korea National Oil Corp.  has said it will keep
focusing on purchasing energy assets including oil fields as
part of a plan to increase production to 300,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day by 2012. The company’s daily output rose to
183,000 barrels after the acquisition of Scotland’s  Dana
Petroleum Plc .  South Korea, Asia’s second-largest buyer of liquefied
natural gas, will seek new contracts for stable supplies of the
fuel, according to the ministry.  Korea Gas Corp. is in talks to acquire a 15 percent stake
in the  Santos Ltd. -led Gladstone LNG venture in Australia and to
buy 9.8 percent of Indonesia’s Senoro project run by  Mitsubishi
Corp. , the state-run utility said on Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
