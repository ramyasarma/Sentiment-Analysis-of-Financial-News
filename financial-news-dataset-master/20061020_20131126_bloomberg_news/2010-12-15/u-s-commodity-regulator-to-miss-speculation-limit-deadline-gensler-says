The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission will miss a January deadline to limit speculation in
commodities including energy and metals, CFTC Chairman Gary
Gensler told lawmakers at a House Agriculture subcommittee
meeting today.  The Dodd-Frank financial-regulation overhaul gave the CFTC
until Jan. 17 to impose restrictions on the number of contracts
one firm could hold in commodities including oil, natural gas,
silver and gold, and until April to place a cap on agricultural
contracts. CFTC commissioners will meet on the matter tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
