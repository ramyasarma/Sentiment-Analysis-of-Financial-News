Japanese  stock   futures  rose as the
dollar strengthened to the highest level in almost three months
against the yen, boosting the outlook for export earnings.
Australian stocks declined.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. , a Japanese
electronics maker that derives 70 percent of its sales abroad,
gained 0.2 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those
of Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-biggest bank by
market value, increased 0.2 percent. Shares of Newcrest Mining
Ltd., Australia’s biggest gold producer, retreated 0.6 percent
in Sydney today after prices of the metal dropped.  The dollar strengthened against most of its major
counterparts including the yen yesterday on concern Europe’s
debt crisis may deepen and as U.S. government bond yields rose.  “The situation is not bad for Japanese stocks,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in assets in
Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 10,330 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,290 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,320
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index fell 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was
little changed in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index slipped 0.5 percent yesterday in New
York.  Dollar Strengthens  The dollar rose against most of its major counterparts
yesterday after Moody’s Investors Service put Spain’s debt
rating on review for a possible downgrade and as yields on U.S.
10-year Treasuries advanced to a seven-month high.  The dollar appreciated to 84.51 against the yen, the
highest level since Sept. 24. A stronger dollar boosts the value
of U.S. income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 11 percent through
yesterday in 2010, compared with gains of 11 percent by the S&P
500 and 8.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.7 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 14.5 times for the S&P 500 and 12.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
