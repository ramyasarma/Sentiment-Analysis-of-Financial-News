U.S. investors pulled $401 million
from taxable bond mutual funds in the week ending Dec. 8, the
first net withdrawals in two years.  Municipal bond funds lost $1.3 billion to redemptions,
according to data released today by the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade group for the mutual funds
industry. Investors took out $2.7 billion from domestic stock
funds, their 32nd straight week of withdrawals, while stock
funds that invest outside the U.S. attracted $1.3 billion.  Investors are pulling money from bond funds after the yield
on 10-year Treasuries jumped more than a percentage point since
Nov. 4, the day after the Federal Reserve pledged to buy $600
billion in assets to revive the economy. U.S. individual
investors poured about $252 billion into taxable funds in the
first 11 months of the year, ignoring warnings from  Bill Gross ,
manager of the world’s biggest mutual fund, that the 30-year
bond rally may have ended.  Gross’s $250 billion Pimco  Total Return Fund , run by
Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, California,
lost 2.4 percent, including reinvested interest, in the month
ended Dec. 14.  Taxable bond funds last saw net withdrawals in the week
ended Dec. 10, 2008. Stock and bond mutual funds combined lost
$3.3 billion to withdrawals in the week ended Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
