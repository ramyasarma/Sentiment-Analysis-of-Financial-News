Treasuries fell, erasing gains and
pushing the yield on the 10-year note to a seven-month high, as
evidence the economy is recovering encouraged investors to
unwind bets that the securities will rise.  U.S. debt also dropped on speculation President  Barack Obama ’s agreement to extend tax cuts will pass in Congress,
supporting growth and increasing the budget deficit. Treasuries
tumbled yesterday after the Federal Reserve said the economic
recovery is continuing and maintained its $600 billion program
of debt purchases.  “The market is repricing in a strong-growth scenario, and
there are still people stuck long,” said  Thomas Tucci , head of
U.S. government bond trading in New York at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets, one of the 18 primary dealers that
trade directly with the Fed. “We are talking about unwinding
six months of the bullish trade, so we are going to have moments
of strong sell-offs like this.” A long is a bet an asset will
gain in value.  The yield on the 10-year note increased two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.52 percent at 5:16 p.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 dropped 6/32, or
$1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 92 19/32.  The 10-year note  yield  touched 3.56 percent, the highest
since May 13. It earlier dropped as much as nine basis points to
3.39 percent. The 30-year bond yield gained as much as nine
basis points to 4.62 percent, the highest level since April 29,
after earlier dropping six basis points to 4.47 percent. The
two-year note yield rose two basis points to 0.67 percent.  Treasury Volatility  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE  index , which measures
volatility in Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter
options maturing in 2 to 30 years, rose yesterday to 118.40, the
highest level since October 2009.  Fed officials yesterday kept their plan to buy Treasuries
through June under quantitative easing, disappointing some
investors by not expanding record stimulus.  Primary dealers submitted today $13.114 billion of debt
maturing from December 2014 to May 2016 for possible purchase by
the central bank, compared with $18.268 billion in debt maturing
from June 2016 to November 2017 on Dec. 13. The Fed bought $6.78
billion of debt today, part of $105 billion in purchases over
the next month.  Output at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.4 percent
last month, the biggest gain since July, after a revised 0.2
percent drop in October, a Fed report showed today. The Labor
Department reported that consumer prices excluding food and
energy increased 0.8 percent in November from a year earlier
after an advance of 0.6 percent in the prior month, the smallest
gain in year-over-year data going back to 1958.  ‘Trapped Longs’  “Along with a stronger-than-expected core inflation
number, there were higher economic numbers across the board
today, which is weighing on the long end,” said  Joseph Leary ,
an interest-rate strategist in New York at Citigroup Inc.,
another primary dealer. “We are seeing year-end flows where
there are still trapped longs.”  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, reached 2.34 percentage points, the widest
since May 5.  Real yields, which take into account inflation or
deflation, are 1.65 percent on 10-year Treasuries, compared with
the mean of 2.65 percent for the past 20 years.  Foreign Holdings  Total  foreign holdings of U.S. debt increased in October at
the slowest pace since May, advancing 1.2 percent to $4.31
trillion, the Treasury reported.  China  remained the biggest
foreign holder of Treasuries, with its amount rising in October
to $906.8 billion, the highest level since November 2009.
China’s bill holdings more than doubled to $45.9 billion as the
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe worsened.  “While our dependence on foreign capital may be problematic
in the long run, there isn’t a great deal of risk of foreign
investors fleeing from the Treasury market en masse,”  Kevin Giddis , head of fixed-income sales, trading and research in
Memphis, Tennessee, at Morgan Keegan Inc., wrote in a research
note to clients.  Moody’s Investors Service said it put Spain’s Aa1 credit
rating on review and Portugal’s 500 million euros ($666 million)
auction of three-month bills attracted reduced demand.  European Union leaders start a two-day summit in Brussels
tomorrow with the focus on the permanent crisis-fighting system
to be started in 2013. Germany’s Chancellor  Angela Merkel  has
ruled out an increase in the euro area’s 750 billion euro
emergency fund.  CIBC’s View  Treasury 10-year yields may fall back toward 3 percent as
technical indicators show the debt has been oversold, according
to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  When the yield surged yesterday to 3.49 percent, it crossed
the 61.8 percent retracement from the April high of 4 percent
and a low of 2.33 percent on Oct. 8, based on a series of
numbers known as Fibonacci sequence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
