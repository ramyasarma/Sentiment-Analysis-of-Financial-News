Airbus SAS will miss its 2010 target
for A380 deliveries and anticipates further disruptions to its
schedule next year as it struggles with the aftermath of a
Rolls-Royce Group Plc engine failure.  The planemaker will hand over 19 of its double-decker
passenger jets in 2010, short of the targeted 20, spokesman
 Stefan Schaffrath  said today. Toulouse, France-based Airbus
plans to deliver its 18th A380 as early as tomorrow, to Qantas
Airways Ltd., and will meet the year-end deadline on only one of
two other jets.  Airbus is working to resolve “disruptions and
complications” to its A380 production line following the
explosion of a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine on an A380 operated
by Qantas last month, Airbus Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders 
told employees in a memo last month.  “With the new challenges caused by the Rolls-Royce engine
issue, we’re now comfortable to deliver 19 planes this year,”
Schaffrath said by phone.  Airbus had sought to double last year’s delivery tally of
10 superjumbos. Parent company European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. said last month that 22 had been built and were
largely ready to go to customers this year. However, one for
 Singapore Airlines Ltd.  was held up by problems with seating
supplied by Koito Industries, and another to an undisclosed
airline was awaiting final clearances for financing, it said.  Sitting on Cash  “The issue is that Airbus is sitting on a big lump of
cash with three A380s sitting there and not getting delivered,”
said  Nick Cunningham , managing director at London-based Agency
Partners, an investment advisory company. “Even without engines
attached it could be $600 million, $700 million worth of
finished goods sitting there in your back lot over the yearend,
which is not what you want.”  Airbus’s Enders told employees in a memo sent out today
that the A380 superjumbo still faces “significant challenges
going forward.” Rolls-Royce spokesman  Josh Rosenstock  today
declined to comment on deliveries delayed by the Trent 900.  Deliveries of the A380 model, the world’s largest passenger
aircraft, began in 2007 with one handoff to  Singapore Airlines 
that was two years late because of cabin-wiring faults. The
company has spent at least 18 billion euros ($24 billion) to
develop the plane, 50 percent more than originally projected,
and faltered in meeting demands for features such as showers,
enclosed suites and custom lighting.  The planemaker started 2009 with a target of 18 A380
deliveries, only to later pare that target several times to
finish the year with 10 handovers. Boeing Co. has also suffered
setbacks to the introduction of new jets, including the 787.  Customers Waiting  Five airlines that already fly A380s -- comprised of Air
France-KLM Group, Qantas Airways, Singapore Airlines, Emirates,
and Deutsche Lufthansa AG -- are scheduled to get more
in 2011. In addition are two new customers, China Southern
Airlines Co. and Korean Air Lines Co. Korean Air is expected to
take five A380s in 2011.  Singapore Airlines’s 12th Airbus SAS A380 was delayed after
Koito Industries failed to deliver business-class seats on time.
The airline said the delay isn’t affecting current operations
and the plane will arrive before the end of March.  The A380 can carry 873 passengers, compared with more than
550 on some flights of Chicago-based  Boeing Co.’s  747. Like most
large planes, the Airbus model is outfitted with fewer seats
than the capacity because of space arrangements in premium
cabins. The plane has a list price of $346 million, though
airlines get discounts for multiple purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
