Research In Motion Ltd.  has surged
38 percent since August on prospects for its new tablet device.
That may be too big a jump given the product is late to a market
led by  Apple Inc. ’s iPad, say analysts who are cutting ratings.  Sales estimates for the BlackBerry PlayBook vary from 1
million units next fiscal year to 8 million as analysts try to
predict demand for a computer that won’t emerge until the first
quarter and will also face other rivals besides Apple.  “It’ll be a modest seller and the iPad will likely do 10
times as much,” said  Shaw Wu , an analyst at Kaufman Bros. in
San Francisco, who cut his RIM rating to “hold” Nov. 9. He
estimates RIM will sell 1 million PlayBooks next year at most.  The tablet will show whether RIM can find growth beyond the
BlackBerry handset, which is losing users to Apple’s iPhone and
devices that use Google Inc.’s Android software. PlayBook sales
may reach $1.1 billion, or 4.8 percent of the $22.8 billion in
revenue analysts predict for RIM  next year . The calculation is
based on the median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg survey for
RIM to sell 2.55 million tablets at an average price of $430.  At least six  analysts  have reduced their rating on RIM
shares in the past six weeks, and fewer than half of those
tracked by Bloomberg now recommend buying. Apple’s  stock  is
recommended by 90 percent of analysts following it.  Some are keeping the faith in RIM.  Matthew Robison , an
analyst at Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in a Dec. 10
research note the PlayBook is compelling because it works with
the BlackBerry, letting those hooked on the RIM smartphone to
“continue using their preferred communications device.” He
reiterated his “buy” rating on the stock.  Fighting the Incumbent  RIM  declined  $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $59.18 at 4 p.m. New
York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock is up from a 17-
month low of $42.84 on Aug. 31, before the company unveiled the
tablet. Apple has jumped 56 percent since introducing the iPad
Jan. 27.  RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, is racing to introduce the
tablet for its main audience of what co-Chief Executive Officer
 Jim Balsillie  calls “busy working people,” aiming to prevent
the iPad from making further inroads with business users. Apple
sold 4.19 million iPads last quarter, for revenue of $2.8
billion.  By the time the PlayBook comes out, Apple will have sold
about 17 million iPads, said  Steven Fox , an analyst at Credit
Agricole Securities in New York, who expects annual PlayBook
sales of about 1 million. The iPad went on sale in April.  “Unlike smartphones, where iPhone had a high hurdle to
overcome in penetrating enterprises dominated by incumbent RIM,
the iPad is now the early incumbent in the enterprise that RIM
would need to one-up in its features,” Fox said in a note to
clients last week. He cut his rating on RIM to “underperform.”  Video Competition  RIM says the PlayBook is better than the iPad at tasks such
as playing video. The stock climbed 12 percent in two days in
October after co-CEO  Mike Lazaridis  demonstrated the PlayBook
running video clips. He and Balsillie stress the PlayBook’s
handling of Adobe Systems Inc.’s Flash technology that underpins
much of online video content. The iPad doesn’t support Flash.  The iPad’s dominance in the tablet-computer market will
“change when we’re in the market,” Balsillie said in an
interview last month. Apple CEO  Steve Jobs  has said devices like
the PlayBook are “dead on arrival” because they are too small
to compete with the iPad. The PlayBook has a 7-inch (18-
centimeter) screen, smaller than the iPad’s 9.7-inch display.  Expectations ‘Too High’  Jeff Fidacaro , an analyst with Susquehanna Financial in New
York, expects RIM to ship 8 million PlayBooks next fiscal year.
While his forecast makes him the most bullish among the analysts
surveyed, he says the stock’s recent surge suggests investors
are factoring in even higher sales, of about 10 million units.  “Investor expectations are too high for the incremental
earnings power from this tablet launch,” he said in a note.  Gleacher & Co.’s  Mark McKechnie  and Exane BNP Paribas’s
 Alexander Peterc  both cut their rating on RIM to “neutral,”
saying the stock’s recent rally no longer made it cheap, given
the competition. Peterc expects PlayBook sales of 3.3 million
units next fiscal year. McKechnie predicts 1.8 million.  RIM declined to comment on analysts’ estimates for PlayBook
sales, said  Tenille Kennedy , a company spokeswoman.  ‘PlayBook-Driven Rally’  “A lot of this is the actual PlayBook-driven rally,”
 Colin Gillis , an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York, said in
an interview. “But the actual competitive positioning and
landscape hasn’t changed at all.” He recommends selling RIM
shares.  RIM reports fiscal third-quarter results tomorrow. Sales
rose 38 percent to $5.41 billion, according to the average of 44
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg, helped by new products like the
BlackBerry Torch with a slideout keyboard. Profit per share is
estimated to rise to $1.65 from $1.10 a year earlier.  The PlayBook’s new QNX software is powerful and set to be
the platform for all future RIM devices, said RBC Capital
Markets’  Mike Abramsky . Still, the onus is on RIM to build the
software successfully into the PlayBook and persuade customers
to opt for the device, Abramsky, who is based in Toronto and has
a “top pick” rating on RIM, said in a research note.  “Apple has a huge lead and Android devices are
proliferating,” Abramsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
