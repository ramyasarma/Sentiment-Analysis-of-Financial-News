Pakistan, Vietnam and Indonesia will
lead wage gains in Asia next year, outpacing developed nations
in the region, according to a survey by  Mercer Consulting .  Workers in Pakistan may have a 14.5 percent wage increase,
Vietnam may see a 12.2 percent advance and Indonesia 9.2 percent,
Mercer said, citing the survey of more than 5,000 companies in
15 markets across different industries in Asia. Japan will have
the lowest gain at 2 percent, it said.  The Asian Development Bank this month  raised  its estimate
for growth in developing Asia to 8.6 percent this year as China
expanded more than expected. Low borrowing costs and booming
economies have stoked price pressures, leading to strikes in
China for higher wages and a surge in regional property prices.  “Vietnam, Indonesia, China and India will likely see the
highest growth,” Paul O’Malley, the head of Mercer’s
information product solutions business in Asia, wrote in e-
mailed comments.  The Chinese labor markets of Shanghai, Beijing and
Guangdong will probably see wage increases exceeding 8 percent,
the unit of New York-based insurance broker  Marsh & McLennan Cos 
said.  Employees in developed markets may expect less gains, with
pay projected to rise 4.4 percent in Singapore, 3.8 percent in
Taiwan and 3.4 percent in Hong Kong, Mercer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
