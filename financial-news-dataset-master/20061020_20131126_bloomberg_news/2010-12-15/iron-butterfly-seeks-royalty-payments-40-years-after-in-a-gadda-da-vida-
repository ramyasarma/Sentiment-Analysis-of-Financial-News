Former members of  Iron Butterfly ,
the psychedelic rock band that recorded the 1960s classic “In-
A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” sued  Warner Music Group Corp.  units to
recover royalty payments they say they’re owed.  The three ex-band members and a former lawyer for the group
claim that Atlantic Recording Corp., Elektra Entertainment Group
Inc. and Warner/Chappell Music Inc. owe them at least $236,549,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in New York state
Supreme Court in Manhattan.  “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” released in 1968, is a 17-minute
track that took up one full side of a long-playing record and
helped characterize the music of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
The album has sold more than 30 million copies, according to the
band’s  website .  Will Tanous , a Warner Music Group Corp. spokesman, didn’t
immediately comment.  The case is Dorman v. Atlantic Recording Corp., 652261-
2010, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
