Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said China
was “ready to take further steps” to address a trade imbalance
with India by boosting imports of Indian goods.  Speaking in New Delhi at the beginning of a three-day visit
Wen said the two Asian rivals were not inevitable rivals. “It
is entirely possible for our two countries to draw upon each
other’s strengths and move forward together,” Wen told business
leaders from both countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
