Exxon Mobil Corp.’s liquefied
natural gas project in Papua New Guinea could add a third
production line because of the possibility of finding more
natural gas, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said.  The Hides gas area may contain 50 percent additional
deposits compared with currently booked reserves, Bernstein said
in a report today. Exxon and Oil Search Ltd. plan to produce 6.6
million metric tons a year of the frozen fuel in 2014 from two
production lines at a $15 billion LNG venture.  “The main trunk-line for PNG LNG has the capacity to
accommodate a third and possibly fourth LNG train at a low cost,
making the marginal return on LNG expansion extremely
attractive,” Hong Kong-based analysts,  Neil Beveridge  and  Angus Chan , said in the e-mailed note.  Oil Search and InterOil Corp. are among those planning to
build LNG projects in Papua New Guinea to supply growing Asian
economies. The country remains under-explored and under-
appraised, and the possibility of multi-trillion cubic feet
discoveries, which could underpin future LNG projects, remains
high, Bernstein said.  Oil Search wants to find reserves to support two more
processing units at the Exxon-operated LNG venture, it said in
April.  The analysts gave Oil Search an “outperform” rating and
increased the share-price target to A$8.50 from A$8. Oil Search
advanced 1.2 percent to A$7.01 in Sydney trading today, compared
with a 0.1 percent increase for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
