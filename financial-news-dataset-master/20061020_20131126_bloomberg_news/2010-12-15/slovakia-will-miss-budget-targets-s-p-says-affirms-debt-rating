Slovakia will probably fail to meet
its target to cut the  budget deficit  to 4.9 percent of gross
domestic product next year, Standard and Poor’s said.  The credit evaluator’s "base scenario" is that the gap will
narrow to 6 percent of GDP in 2011 from an estimated 8 percent
this year, S&P said in an e-mailed release from  Frankfurt  today.
It affirmed the country’s debt rating at A+, its fifth-highest
grade, with a stable outlook.  The east European country that adopted the euro last year
is recovering from its first-ever recession, which caused budget
deficit to balloon. The administration of Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova , who assumed power in July, adopted spending cuts and
other austerity measures to reduce the deficit and debt.  "The main risk we see to Slovakia’s sovereign
creditworthiness stems from the deterioration in the country’s
public finances since 2008," S&P analyst Kai Stukenbrock said in
the statement.  Slower-than-projected economic growth combined with
eventual political opposition to austerity measures represent
the main risk for Slovakia’s public finances, he said. S&P
expects the fiscal gap to reach 4 percent in 2013, or one
percentage point more than the government’s target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
