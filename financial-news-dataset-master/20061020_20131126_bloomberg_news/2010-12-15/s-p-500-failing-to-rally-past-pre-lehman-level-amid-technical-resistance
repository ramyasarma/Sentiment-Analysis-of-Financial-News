Restoring all the losses spurred by
the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is  testing  the
resolve of U.S. stock market bulls.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied above 1,245
yesterday before paring its gains, failing for a second day to
surpass the last closing level before Lehman Brothers collapsed
in September 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Climbing above 1,251.70, its close on Sept. 12, 2008, may
mean investors are growing confident the 21 percent rally since
July 2 is sustainable, as companies report  higher-than-estimated
profits  and the Federal Reserve attempts to boost the economy by
buying bonds. The S&P 500, up 11 percent this year, exceeded the
previous 2010 high of 1,217.28 reached in April and posted a
combined gain of 13 percent in September and  October .  “That’s obviously a critical level, that’s the level where
we realized things were broken,” said  Ryan Detrick , senior
technical analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, in a
telephone interview from Cincinnati yesterday. “Now that we’re
back up there, it makes sense the market takes a pause.”  The benchmark gauge rose as high as 1,246.59 at 2:21 p.m.
yesterday before falling back to 1,238.17.  The S&P 500  had a
similar move on Dec. 13, reaching 1,246.73 at 2:46 p.m. before
erasing all its gains in the last hour to mark the smallest
daily gain since Oct. 26.  Today’s Trading  The S&P 500 touched 1,244.25 today before dropping to
1,235.23 as of 4 p.m. New York time.  On Sept. 15, 2008, the equity benchmark fell 4.7 percent,
the steepest drop since the first day of trading after the Sept.
11, 2001, terrorist attacks, as Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and
declining asset prices led investors to speculate that markets
would freeze and the economic slowdown would worsen. Writedowns
and credit related losses have totaled more than $1.8 trillion
globally since the start of the financial crisis, and the S&P
500 fell as much as 57 percent from its peak in October 2007
through March 2009.  While the S&P 500 has rallied 84 percent since reaching a
12-year low in March of last year, unemployment at a quarter-
century high at 9.8 percent has led some investors to remain
cautious. Pacific Investment Management Co., manager of the
world’s biggest bond fund, has warned since May 2009 that
slower-than-normal economic recovery would hold returns below
average levels. Equity funds have seen more than $80 billion in
outflows since the start of May, according to the Washington-
based Investment Company Institute.  European Crisis  The S&P 500 reached a 2010 low of 1,022.58 on July 2 amid
increased speculation some European nations will be unable to
repay their debt.  Christopher Verrone , lead technical analyst at
New York-based Strategas Research Partners, said a so-called
head-and-shoulder chart pattern based on the lows of March 2009
and July means the S&P 500 will face resistance between 1,240
and 1,250.  “It’s purely technical moves,” Verrone said. The 1,251.70
Lehman level “has some psychological impact. It’s close to a
round number -- 1,250 -- and people put emphasis on round-number
resistance. It’s in the back of people’s minds.”  The head-and-shoulders pattern is formed by three
consecutive peaks on a chart, the highest in the middle. The
level that unites the troughs between the peaks is known as the
neckline. In technical analysis, investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  Breaking Through  The S&P 500 may also be pausing after a rally, according to
Detrick. He predicts the benchmark measure will break through to
close above 1,251.70 by the end of the year.  “We’ve had this big move and now we’re selling off late in
the day, but it doesn’t appear it’s big institutions dumping a
lot of the shares,” Detrick said. “That’s an encouraging sign
for the bulls. It’s simply that the market’s catching its
breath.”  The S&P 500 has gained an average of 1.9 percent during the
last 10 trading days of the year, according to Bespoke
Investment Group data going back to 1990. While there are 12
trading days remaining in 2010, such a gain would push the
benchmark gauge to 1,265.18 from yesterday’s close, above the
pre-Lehman level.  “You’re seeing a change in trend in the daily market
moves,” said  Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at
Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida, who helps
manage $240 billion. For the rest of the year, the S&P 500 will
“recoup and rebuild itself for another rally into the first
part of next year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
