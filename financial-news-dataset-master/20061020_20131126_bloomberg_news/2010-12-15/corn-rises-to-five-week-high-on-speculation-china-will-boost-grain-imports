Corn rose to a five-week high on
speculation that demand for imported grain will rise in China,
the world’s second-biggest producer.  China is “more likely” to use imported corn this
marketing year because the government hasn’t established a
temporary reserve, Cngrain.com, a unit of China Grain Reserves
Corp., said in a Dec. 13 report. China was a  net importer  of
corn in the year that ended Sept. 30 for the first time in 14
years, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  “Chinese corn demand is rising” as farmers expand
livestock production to meet increased consumption of pork and
beef, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in
Fowler, Indiana.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $5.9275 a bushel at 9:59 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $5.945, the highest since
Nov. 9. Before today, the most-active contract surged 57
percent since the end of June as adverse weather reduced U.S.
production.  Demand in China will gain even as the Asian nation imposes
monetary-tightening measures because it needs to import raw
materials to curb food inflation, according to a report last
month by Macquarie Bank Ltd.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $47.4 billion in
2008, government figures show. The U.S. is also the world’s top
producer and exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
