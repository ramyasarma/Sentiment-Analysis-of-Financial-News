Somalia  denied it suspended the work
of international aid agencies, a day after the Water, Energy and
Mining Ministry said it barred groups including the United
Nations Children’s Fund for failing to attend a meeting.  The government “has not suspended the work of any aid
agencies,” Somali Prime Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed’s
office said in an e-mailed statement today in Mogadishu, the
capital. “We support and encourage humanitarian agencies to come
to Somalia and help alleviate the plight of the suffering
population.”  Somalia has been in a state of civil war for the past two
decades and hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of former dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.
Many of the country’s poor depend on humanitarian agencies for
food and shelter.  Deputy Water Minister Abdirahman Yusuf Farah said Unicef,
the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Norwegian
Refugee Council and Daryeel Bulsho Guud DBG would be blocked
from working in the Horn of Africa nation after they didn’t
attend a meeting on Dec. 13.  “The statement attributed to the deputy minister was
misunderstood and taken out of context,” according to the
statement. “He was merely expressing his frustration over the
fact that aid groups had failed to attend a meeting called by
his ministry to address the prevailing drought that is ravaging
the country and the humanitarian need arising from it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
