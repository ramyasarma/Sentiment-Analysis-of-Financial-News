Crude oil fell from a one-week high
because of concern that warmer weather in the U.S. may reduce
demand for heating oil.  Oil pared yesterday’s gains after the Energy Department
said stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 1.09 million barrels to 161.3
million. Normal or warmer-than-normal weather is likely in most
of the Northeast and Midwest from Dec. 25 to Dec. 29, according
to Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland.  Middle distillate supplies were “a bearish number
seasonally speaking,” Stephen Schork, president of consultant
Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in a note to
clients. “Last year saw a 2.95 million-barrel draw.”  Crude for January delivery fell as much as 57 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $88.05 a barrel and was at $88.15 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 4:14 p.m. Singapore time. Oil increased
34 cents, or 0.4 percent yesterday to $88.62 a barrel, the
highest settlement price since Dec. 7.  The price rose after the Energy Department said crude
 inventories  fell 9.85 million barrels last week to 346 million,
bolstering optimism that demand from refiners is increasing.
Plants  operated  at 88 percent of capacity, the most since
September.  U.S. crude supplies were forecast to drop 2.5 million
barrels, a Bloomberg survey showed. The gain was limited as the
decline was concentrated on the Gulf Coast.  Inventories  at
Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New York futures,
increased by 982,000 barrels to 35.9 million, the highest level
since August.  U.S. Weather  U.S. crude imports slipped to  7.69 million barrels  a day,
the report showed. Fuel imports dropped 11 percent to 2.36
million barrels a day.  Temperatures during the last week of December may be 5 to
10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than this week, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.  Gasoline supplies  rose 809,000 barrels to 214.8 million
last week, the Energy Department report showed. They were
forecast to climb 2 million barrels, according to the median of
17 responses in the Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles of
 distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, increased 1.09 million barrels to 161.3 million.  Brent crude oil for January settlement was at $91.79 a
barrel, down 41 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The January contract expires today. The more actively
traded February contract was at $91.72 a barrel, down 43 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
