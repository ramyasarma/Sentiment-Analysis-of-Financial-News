Fiat SpA , Toyota Motor Corp. and
 Ford Motor Co.  led an eighth consecutive monthly decline in
European car deliveries as fallout from last year’s government
incentives hampered a recovery in the region’s largest markets.  Registrations fell 6.5 percent to 1.11 million cars in
November from 1.18 million a year earlier, the Brussels-based
 European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association  said today in a
 statement . Eleven-month sales dropped 5.1 percent to 12.7
million cars.  The slump was most pronounced in markets where governments
were slower to phase out incentives aimed at countering the 2009
recession. Italy’s market shrank 21 percent, contributing to
 Fiat ’s 24 percent registration plunge. In contrast, sales rose
at luxury-car makers such as  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , which
derived little benefit from state programs and won buyers with
the X1 compact sport-utility vehicle and revamped 5-Series car.  “We’re seeing a more contrasted picture,” said  Philippe Houchois , a London-based analyst at UBS AG. While Italy, France
and their carmakers are still struggling, “Germany is better
than expected and its premium carmakers are finally beginning to
stabilize.”  The year-on-year comparison in Italy was exacerbated by a
surge at the end of 2009, when customers rushed to qualify for
government payments before the program expired. Turin-based
Fiat, which posted a 28 percent jump in European registrations
in  November 2009 , sold 74,194 cars in the region last month.  Payment Cutback  The French market shrank by 11 percent in November. A
trade-in bonus of 1,000 euros ($1,330) was cut by 250 euros in
both January and July. The contraction helped drag down European
registrations last month by 12 percent to 115,487 cars at
Boulogne-Billancourt-based  Renault SA  and by 9.5 percent to
144,542 at Paris-based  PSA Peugeot Citroen .  “French sales have been getting a stimulus all the way, so
we still don’t know where the real market is,” UBS’s Houchois
said.  Markets that had few or no subsidies, or where cash-for-
clunkers payments halted more than a year ago, are showing
improvement. The decline in the German market, where the subsidy
stopped in September 2009, slowed to 6.2 percent from 20 percent
in October. Eastern Europe’s sales growth jumped to 22 percent
from 12 percent, and gains in Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal
and Finland all accelerated.  Luxury Leaders’ Gains  European sales as Munich-based BMW, the world’s biggest
luxury-car manufacturer, jumped 19 percent last month to 66,050
cars. Second-ranked  Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz brand, maker of
the CLS coupe and E-Class sedan, led the Stuttgart-based group’s
2.5 percent gain to 60,002 vehicles.  Toyota  recorded November’s second-biggest sales decline
after Fiat, with a 20 percent drop to 44,670 registrations.  Ford 
came third with a 15 percent slide to 85,856 cars. Wolfsburg,
Germany-based  Volkswagen AG , the region’s biggest carmaker,
recorded a 5.2 percent decline to 235,614 vehicles.  The recovery in eastern European markets helped  Hyundai
Motor Co.  and  General Motors Co.  to post gains in November. The
South Korean carmaker recorded a 6.4 percent increase to 30,087
sales, lifting its market share so far this year by 0.2 point to
2.6 percent, while Detroit-based GM’s registrations advanced 4.2
percent to 98,319.  To contact the reporter on this story:
