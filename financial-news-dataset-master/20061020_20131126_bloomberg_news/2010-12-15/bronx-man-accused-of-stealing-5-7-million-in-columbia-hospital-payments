A Bronx, New York, man was indicted
on charges of stealing $5.7 million from Columbia University by
redirecting payments intended for a hospital.  George Castro, 48, in October and November sent 56  Columbia 
payments for New York Presbyterian Hospital to a TD Bank account
registered in the name of a company he formed, Manhattan
District Attorney  Cyrus R. Vance Jr.  said today in a statement.
Castro allegedly distributed the money to bank accounts in his
name, sent money to family and friends, and bought an $80,000
Audi Q7 automobile and more than $18,000 of  Apple Inc.  products.  About $4.1 million of the $5.7 million has been identified,
frozen or seized, Vance said. Castro and his company, IT &
Securities Solutions LLC, aren’t affiliated with the university
or the hospital, according to the statement.  Erin Duggan , a spokeswoman for Vance, declined to comment
on how Castro allegedly gained access to the Columbia money.  Castro, who is being held in lieu of $2 million bail,
pleaded not guilty today to charges of grand larceny, possession
of stolen property and money laundering. If convicted, he faces
as long as 25 years in prison, according to prosecutors.  David Fisher, an attorney for Castro, didn’t immediately
return a call for comment. Douglas Levy, a spokesman for
Columbia, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
