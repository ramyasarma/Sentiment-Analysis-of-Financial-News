First Horizon National Corp. , the
Tennessee-based bank chartered in  1864 , plans to sell $400
million of senior notes to help fund the repurchase of Troubled
Asset Relief Program preferred shares.  The five-year debt may be issued as soon as today, said a
person familiar with the transaction, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  First Horizon also sold stock to help finance the
repurchase of preferred shares held by the U.S. Treasury and
subordinated debentures, it said today in a statement
distributed by Globe Newswire that didn’t specify the timing or
maturity of the offering.  First Horizon, based in Memphis, Tennessee, raised about
$250 million by selling 23.8 million of shares at $10.50 each,
according to a statement yesterday.  The $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, enacted in
October 2008 to prevent a collapse of the U.S. financial system,
provided money to shore up financial-services companies,
including American International Group Inc. Some recipients,
such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp., have
since repaid the money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
