Copper rebounded in London on
expectation supply will lag behind demand as the global economy
extends a recovery. Futures pared losses in Shanghai and New
York.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.4 percent to $9,205.75 a metric ton,
and traded at $9,200 by 9:05 a.m. Singapore time. Copper reached
a record $9,267.50 a ton yesterday, before erasing gains on
concern China will step up measures to curb inflation.  March-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained 0.2 percent to 68,910 yuan a ton, after falling as much
as 0.3 percent earlier. Futures on the Comex in New York were
little changed after dropping 0.4 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
