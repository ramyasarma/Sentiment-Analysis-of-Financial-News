What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on speculation that export demand
will rebound following the biggest price drop yesterday in a
month, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in
Fowler, Indiana.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on signs that China will increase imports to
build inventories, Gerlach said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on speculation that adverse weather will reduce
production in South America, Gerlach said. Soybean-meal futures
may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open steady to down 0.1 cent a pound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
