China is “more likely” to use
imported corn this marketing year because the government hasn’t
bought a temporary reserve of the grain, Cngrain.com said in a
research report posted on its website on Dec. 13.  The country’s corn prices will be more influenced by global
markets in the marketing year that began Oct. 1, the report also
said. Cngrain.com is a unit of China Grain Reserves Corp., which
manages state stockpiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
