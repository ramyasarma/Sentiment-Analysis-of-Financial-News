Japan’s  Topix index  rose for a third
day, the longest winning streak in more than a week, as better-
than-forecast retail sales in the U.S. and a weaker yen boosted
the outlook for exporters’ earnings.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s biggest carmaker, rose 0.9
percent. Mitsubishi Estate Co. climbed 0.4 percent after the
Bank of Japan said yesterday it will start buying real estate
investment trusts as early as today. Otsuka Holdings Inc.,
Japan’s fifth-biggest drugmaker by sales, gained 2 percent on
its first day of trading. JFE Holdings Inc., Japan’s No. 2
steelmaker, slipped 1.2 percent after the Tankan index of large-
manufacturer sentiment fell.  “Investors aren’t deeply worried about the outlook for the
economy, but they are not seeing clear signs of improvement
either,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion in
Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co. “It’s hard for people to
take the step to invest.”  The  Topix  index increased 0.1 percent to 902.42 at the
close, with about three stocks rising for every two that
declined. The gauge, which changed directions more than 130
times in midday trading, had the longest winning streak since
the period ended Dec. 6. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 0.1
percent to 10,309.78.  The Topix has lost 0.6 percent in 2010 compared with gains
of 11 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 9.4 percent
by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark
are valued at 15.6 times estimated  earnings  on average, compared
with 14.5 times for the S&P 500 and 12.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Canon, Sony  Auto-related stocks and electronics makers climbed.  Toyota
Motor Corp. , the No. 1 carmaker worldwide, rose 0.9 percent to
3,290 yen, and Denso Corp., an automobile-parts maker, gained
1.8 percent to 2,888 yen.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets more than 80 percent
of its revenue abroad, gained 0.4 percent to 4,095 yen, and Sony
Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions, also advanced 0.4
percent to 3,000 yen.  Purchases at U.S. retailers increased 0.8 percent,
following a 1.7 percent gain in October, Commerce Department
figures showed yesterday. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 0.6 percent rise.  “U.S. consumption is recovering, and the global economy is
mildly improving,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in
Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  Exporters also climbed as the yen weakened to 83.87 against
the dollar today, compared with 83.46 at the close of stock
trading in Tokyo yesterday. A weaker yen boosts overseas income
at Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Real Estate Shares  The  Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT index  of 35 real estate
investment trusts reached the highest level in more than two
years after the Bank of Japan yesterday said it will begin
buying REITs and other financial assets as early as today.  Mitsubishi Estate Co. , Japan’s biggest developer by market
value, increased 0.4 percent to 1,458 yen. Kenedix Realty
Investment Corp. gained 3.8 percent to 393,000 yen. Nomura Real
Estate Residential Fund Inc. jumped 4.2 percent to 457,500 yen.  Otsuka Holdings Inc., Japan’s fifth-biggest drugmaker by
sales, increased 2 percent from its initial public offering
price to 2,140 yen on its first day of trading. The developer of
the Abilify mental-illness treatment offered 94.5 million shares
including overallotment at 2,100 yen each.  Dentsu Inc. , Japan’s largest advertising company, gained
2.7 percent to 2,524 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley raised
the stock’s rating to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Manufacturer Confidence  Confidence among Japan’s largest manufacturers worsened for
the first time since the end of the global financial crisis last
year. The Bank of Japan said the quarterly Tankan index of
sentiment at large manufacturers dropped to 5 in December from 8
in September. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a reading of 3. A positive number means
optimists outnumber pessimists.  Today’s report adds to concern that Japan’s economy may
contract in the fourth quarter, and buttresses the case for the
Bank of Japan to consider more monetary stimulus. Data for
October showed industrial output fell by the most since February
2009, export growth moderated and the jobless rate rose.  JFE dropped 1.2 percent to 2,866 yen. Nippon Steel Corp.,
Japan’s largest maker of the alloy, fell 1.3 percent to 301 yen.
Kobe Steel Ltd. declined 1 percent to 208 yen. A measure of iron
and steel companies had the second- biggest decline  among the
Topix index’s 33 industry groups.  Consumer Lenders  Acom Co. slipped 4 percent to 916 yen, and  Promise Co. 
dropped 3.7 percent to 440 yen after the consumer lenders had
their credit ratings placed on review for possible downgrade by
Moody’s Investors Service. Moody’s cited customers’ demands to
be reimbursed for excessive interest payments, according to
separate statements from the rating company.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co.  declined 1.3 percent to
3,130 yen after the rating on the oil driller was cut to
“neutral” from “outperform” at Credit Suisse Group AG.  The 25-day Toraku index, a measure of daily stock winners
and losers on the Topix also dragged on the market. The measure
rose to 150 yesterday, according to Bloomberg data. A level of
more than 120 suggests to some investors the market is poised to
fall.  “The market has been gaining sharply, and investors are
becoming cautious,” said Shinkin’s Fujiwara. “That’s weighing
on the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
