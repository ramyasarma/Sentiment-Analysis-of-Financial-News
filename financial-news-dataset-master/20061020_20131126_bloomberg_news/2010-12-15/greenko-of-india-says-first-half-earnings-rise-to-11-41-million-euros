Greenko Group Plc , an Indian clean-
energy developer, said first-half profit soared as it sold power
from hydro projects.  Net income in the six months ended Sept. 30 rose to 6.2
million euros ($8.3 million), or 4.71 cents a share, from
774,200 euros, or 1.14 cents a share, a year earlier, the Isle
of Man, U.K.-based company said today in a statement. Revenue
tripled to 25.8 million euros.  “Our profits have been driven by our hydro assets which
has been the best investment and we are delivering as
expected,” President  Mahesh Kolli  said in a telephone interview
today. “Clean energy is mainstream energy in India, not just a
nice thing to do.”  Demand for power in India, Asia’s third-biggest economy, is
expected to outstrip power capacity over the next decade, Kolli
said. Greenko, which has hydro, biomass and gas projects,
increased its power capacity by 200 megawatts to 811 megawatts
in the first half.  “The key is that the energy market in India is very strong
and there is a lack of supply,” Kolli said.  The company, which sells power to the state and Indian
companies, said it has a pipeline of potential new projects
which have a secured capacity of more than 1 gigawatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
