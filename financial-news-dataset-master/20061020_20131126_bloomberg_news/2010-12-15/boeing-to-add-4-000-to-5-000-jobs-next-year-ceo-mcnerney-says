Boeing Co.  plans to hire 4,000 to
5,000 workers next year at its commercial hubs in Seattle and
South Carolina as exports drive growth, Chief Executive Officer
 Jim McNerney  said.  Business executives encouraged U.S. President Barack Obama
in a meeting today to sign more bilateral trade agreements with
countries including China and India, McNerney said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television.  Obama is committed to agreements with South Korea, Panama
and Colombia, and “there was a sense in the room that Korea is
the beginning, not the end,” McNerney said of today’s meeting.
The group agreed to “move beyond the rhetoric” of whether the
Obama administration was anti-business or not, he said.  About 80 percent of Boeing’s commercial-plane backlog is
made up of purchases from abroad. The company is boosting
production at its Seattle base to work through seven years worth
of unfilled orders and is building a new factory in Charleston,
South Carolina, to build its new 787 Dreamliner.  During the recession, McNerney said the company needed to
cut about 10,000 jobs, or 6 percent of the workforce.  Boeing, based in Chicago,  fell  26 cents to $64.23 at 3:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
had gained 19 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
