Sugar rallied for a fourth straight
session on speculation that plans by India to resume exports may
fail to boost supplies enough to meet rising global consumption.
Cocoa and coffee also rose.  Demand for sugar will reach 165.3 million metric tons,
almost 3 million tons more than output, compared with a previous
forecast of a 1.2 million-ton surplus, ABN Amro and VM Group
said in a Dec. 10 report. The biggest production deficit will be
in Asia at 13.9 million tons. India, the second-largest grower,
today authorized 500,000 tons of annual exports and will decide
next month whether to raise the limit.  “People are concerned about the availability of sugar,”
said  Ricardo Scaff , a trader at Rabobank International in New
York. “Sugar from India may not be enough as output is
declining in other places like Brazil.”  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.33 cent, or 1.1
percent, to settle at 31.11 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The commodity has more than doubled
from a 13-month low in May on concern that global supplies may
be restricted because of adverse weather in Brazil, the world’s
biggest producer, as well as in China and Russia.  Output in Brazil’s Center South, the world’s largest
producing region, fell 18 percent in the second half of
November, according to Unica, an industry association. The group
yesterday cut its forecast for the cane crop to 560 million tons
from an Aug. 26 estimate of 570.2 million.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery lost
$1.50, or 0.2 percent, to $767.90 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for March delivery added $39, or 1.3 percent,
to settle at $2,979 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures
for March delivery gained 54 pounds, or 2.8 percent, to 1,998
pounds ($3,107) a ton in London.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose 0.8 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.175 a pound in New York. In London, robusta-
coffee-futures for March delivery rose $12, or 0.6 percent, to
$1,931 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
