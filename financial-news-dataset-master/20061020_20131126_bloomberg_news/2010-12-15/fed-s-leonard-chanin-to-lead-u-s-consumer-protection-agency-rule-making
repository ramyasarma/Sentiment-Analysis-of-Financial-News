Elizabeth Warren , the Obama
administration special adviser charged with setting up the new
U.S. consumer financial protection bureau, named  Leonard Chanin 
of the Federal Reserve to head the agency’s rule-making team.  Chanin, deputy director of the Fed’s Division of Consumer
and Community Affairs, will play “a key role in building an
effective and efficient rule writing team,” Warren said in a
statement today.  Warren, the Harvard University law professor appointed by
President  Barack Obama  in September, also confirmed that Ohio
Attorney General  Richard Cordray  will head the consumer bureau’s
enforcement arm and David Silberman, a former executive with
Kessler Financial Services, will direct the agency’s card
markets division. Both picks were previously reported by
Bloomberg News.  None of the officials need to be confirmation by Congress.
Only the agency’s director, who hasn’t been named, must be
confirmed by the Senate.  All consumer agency officials are technically employees of
the Treasury Department until the agency officially starts work
in July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
