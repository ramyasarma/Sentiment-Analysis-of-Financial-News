Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd.  and
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the nation’s biggest copper producers,
are seeking a 76 percent increase in treatment and refining fees
as demand rebounds, said two people familiar with the plans.  The companies, which will together produce about 660,000
metric tons of copper this year, are asking mining companies
including  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  to pay $82 a ton
for smelting for 2011, compared with $46.50 this year, said two
of the people, declining to be identified as the talks are on.
Charges for refining the smelted ore into metal will be raised
to 8.2 cents a pound from 4.65 cents.  Demand for copper, used in pipes and wiring, is reviving
with the global economic recovery. The price surged to a record
on Dec. 13 on speculation demand from China will rise. China,
the biggest buyer, bought a record 683,523 tons of copper in
September.  Sterlite  fell 0.2 percent to 170.25 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close of trading in Mumbai.  Hindalco  declined 1.3 percent to
221.75 rupees. The key Sensitive Index dropped 0.8 percent.  Hindalco   and Sterlite, which together control more than 95
percent of India’s copper production have concentrate inventory
of as many as 35 days against the usual 18 to 21 days, two of
the people said.  “With such high supplies of concentrate these companies
are going to benefit,” said  Giriraj Daga  an analyst at Nirmal
Bang Securities Ltd. in Mumbai.  Higher Supplies  Refining and treatment charges, which fell as much as 38
percent in 2010 because of the global recession, will favor
smelter owners next year, said one of the people. The fees for
producing copper from semi-processed ore, known as concentrate,
increase when ore supplies rise as miners seek to secure
refining capacity.  Smelters in China and Japan are also in negotiations and
copper miners are expected to agree to the increase shortly, the
person said. Fees for 2011 contracts may rise to at least $60 a
ton for treatment and 6 cents a pound for refining, Macquarie
Group Ltd. said in November.  UBS AG and Standard Chartered Plc are forecasting higher
copper prices next year on expectations of a shortfall. UBS this
week raised its 2011 estimate to $4.15 a pound ($9,150 a ton)
from $3.68, while Standard Chartered raised its forecast for
next year to $8,825 a ton from $8,375.  The copper shortage in 2011 will be 500,000 tons, compared
with a deficit of 200,000 tons this year, according to BNP
Paribas SA, which also forecast a shortfall in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
