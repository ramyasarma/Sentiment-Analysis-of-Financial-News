Lebanon sold 1.5 trillion Lebanese
pounds ($1 billion) of seven-year government bonds today, its
longest maturity for domestic borrowing.  The securities, which mature in December 2017, have a
coupon rate of 7.9 percent,  Ziad Moubarak , deputy head of
financial markets at  Byblos Bank SAL  in Beirut, which managed
the sale, said in a telephone interview today.  The new issue “tests the market appetite for longer
maturities in the local currency, and helps the government
further shift the financing of the deficit and the composition
of the public debt from foreign currencies to Lebanese pounds,”
said  Nassib Ghobril , head of research at the bank.  Lebanon’s budget deficit widened 4 percent to 3.78 trillion
Lebanese pounds in the first 10 months of the year from 3.63
trillion pounds in the same period last year as debt payments
increased, according the  Ministry of Finance . Interest payments
on domestic debt rose 8 percent in the first 10 months, while
repayment of foreign debt principal increased 17 percent, the
ministry said.  Prime Minister  Saad Hariri’s  national unity coalition,
formed a year ago, has to finance public debt that the
government expects to rise to $55.3 billion next year, or about
129 percent of gross domestic product. Lebanon has had budget
deficits of almost 10 percent of economic output in the past two
years.  Lebanon sold $725 million of Eurobonds last month to
refinance debt maturing in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
