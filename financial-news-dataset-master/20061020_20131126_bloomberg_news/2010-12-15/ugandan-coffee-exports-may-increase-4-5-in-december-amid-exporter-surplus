Coffee exports from Uganda, Africa’s
biggest producer of the robusta variety, may climb 4.5 percent
this month because exporters have surplus beans, the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments may increase to 285,000 60-kilogram (132-pound)
bags, from 272,755 bags a year earlier, the agency said today by
e-mail from the capital, Kampala. The forecast is 6.5 percent
higher than the 267,506 bags exported in November, when the
harvest in  Uganda ’s central and eastern regions was at an
earlier stage, the authority said.  This month’s projection is based on “high stocks with
exporters, especially arabica, and the fact that farmers will be
releasing stocks to the market for Christmas cash,” the
authority said.  Shipments from Oct. 1 through November increased 5.3
percent to 455,518 bags, according to a tally of UCDA data by
Bloomberg. Exports in the season through September 2011 may grow
by 16 percent to 3.1 million bags because of an expected
improvement in the weather, the agency said on Sept. 20.  The East African nation, whose crop is largely rain-fed,
received improved rains earlier this year resulting in a bigger
crop, according to the authority. Shipments from Uganda, which
consumes only 3 percent of its harvest, declined last season
from 3.06 million bags in 2008-09 after a drought cut yields.  Output in Uganda slumped from more than 4 million bags in
1996-97 after coffee wilt disease destroyed the crop, according
to the authority. New planting and improving farm management may
help the country boost output to 4.5 million bags by 2015, the
authority says.  Uganda is Africa’s second-biggest producer of coffee, after
 Ethiopia . Robusta accounts for about 85 percent of the country’s
annual output and the country earned $243.6 million from the
crop last season, compared with $291.3 million in 2008-09
because of a decline in volume, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
