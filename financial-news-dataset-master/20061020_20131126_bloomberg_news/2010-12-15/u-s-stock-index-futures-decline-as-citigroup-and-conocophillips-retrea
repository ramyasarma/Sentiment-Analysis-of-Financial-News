U.S. stocks fell, dragging the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down from a two-year high, after a
six-day rally left the benchmark gauge trading at its most
expensive level since June and a surge in bond yields fueled
concern that borrowing costs will increase.  General Electric Co ., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Alcoa Inc.
dropped at least 1.1 percent for the biggest declines in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.  Visa Inc . and  MasterCard Inc . fell
more than 1.9 percent ahead of a Federal Reserve Board meeting
tomorrow that may disclose proposed caps on some transaction
fees. Chipmakers slumped after Gartner Inc. predicted spending
on semiconductor equipment will drop next year.  The  S&P 500  slipped 0.5 percent to 1,235.23 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The index closed with a 15.5 price-earnings ratio
yesterday, the highest in almost six months. The  Dow  lost 19.07
points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,457.47. Ten-year Treasury yields,
which influence rates on consumer loans, rose five basis points
to 3.53 percent, according to BGCantor Market Data, after
surging 22 points yesterday.  “Stock investors are focused on the bond market,” said
 Eric Teal , chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which manages $4.5 billion.
“People are concerned about higher borrowing costs even as the
Fed tries to keep interest rates low. There’s also heightened
concern about Europe. On top of that, we saw a run up in
equities and I’d say we’re in a sort of neutral valuation
range.”  Pumping Cash  The S&P 500 has risen 18 percent since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated on Aug. 27 that he might pump more cash into
financial markets through bond purchases. The Fed announced
after its November meeting that it will buy $600 billion in
Treasuries and said yesterday it was maintaining that plan.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index snapped a seven-day rally.
Spain’s credit rating may be cut from Aa1, Moody’s Investors
Service said, as the government prepares its final bond sale of
the year tomorrow amid concern it may follow Greece and Ireland
in seeking a bailout. Spain has to raise 170 billion euros ($226
billion) next year, while refinancing needs for its regions
total 30 billion euros and for banks around 90 billion euros,
Moody’s estimates.  “It’s the Dracula trade,” said  Philip Dow , director of
equity strategy at Minneapolis-based RBC Wealth Management,
which oversees $164 billion. “It just won’t die. You had
Greece, then Ireland, Portugal and Spain. It seems endless. In
the U.S., you have good corporate numbers and better economic
indicators. There’s a tug-of-war going on.”  Manufacturing  The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.2 percent earlier today. A
gauge of manufacturing in the New York region rebounded more
than forecast in December. The Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s general economic  index  climbed to 10.6, exceeding the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Readings greater than zero signal expansion. Separate Fed data
showed U.S. industrial production increased 0.4 percent, topping
the 0.3 percent median gain forecast by economists in a survey.  The rally that’s driven the S&P 500 to a two-year high has
also helped drive confidence that gains will continue to a level
last seen when the equity measure peaked in October 2007,
according to a survey of newsletters by Investors Intelligence.  The proportion of publications that are bullish increased
to 56.8 percent in the week ended yesterday from 56.2 percent,
according to  Investors Intelligence . A 21 percent surge since
July 2 drove the S&P 500 to 1,241.59 yesterday, almost reaching
its last closing price before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
2008 bankruptcy prompted a six-month, 46 percent plunge.  Optimism Peaks  Optimism at peak levels is a sign market rallies are likely
to stall, according to some contrarian analysts. Because fewer
pessimists are left, there may not be enough left who can be
convinced to change their view and help fuel more gains.  “Optimism is exceedingly high,” said  Chad Morganlander , a
Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus,
which oversees $90 billion. “Historical indications would
suggest that a pullback is in store for the markets.”  Alcoa dropped 1.6 percent to $13.96, the biggest decline in
the Dow average. JPMorgan slid 1.4 percent to $40.21. GE slumped
1.1 percent to $17.49.  Visa declined 4.6 percent to $76.94, while MasterCard fell
1.9 percent to $249.22, ahead of a meeting tomorrow by the Fed,
which may disclose proposed caps on debit-card transaction fees
mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial-regulation overhaul.  Chipmakers  Chipmakers had the third-biggest decline in the S&P 500
among 24 industries, slumping 1 percent. Spending on
semiconductor equipment will decline 1 percent next year after a
record 131 percent increase in 2010 to $38.4 billion, researcher
Gartner Inc. said in a statement.  Broadcom Corp. fell 1.5 percent to $44.29. The biggest
maker of chips for television set-top boxes had its 2011 profit
estimate reduced to $2.15 a share from $2.20 by Deutsche Bank
AG, which cited rising operating expenses and share count.  To contact the reporter on this story:
