Copper prices fell the most in three
weeks in New York as a potential downgrade of Spain’s credit
rating revived concern that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen,
hampering the global economic rebound.  Moody’s Investors Services said Spain’s rating may be cut
from Aa1, amid growing concern it could follow Greece and
Ireland in seeking a bailout. Prices also fell on speculation
that China, the world’s largest metals consumer, may have to
raise interest rates to cool inflation.  Europe is “one step away from the next crisis,” Edward
Meir, a senior commodity analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in
Darien, Connecticut, said in a report. “We are in store for a
rather sharp correction over the next several weeks as investors
have not yet fully discounted the implications of rising
interest rates.”  Copper futures for March delivery fell 7.65 cents, or 1.8
percent, to close at $4.1325 a pound at 1:27 p.m. on the Comex
in New York, the biggest loss for a most-active contract since
Nov. 22.  Yesterday, the price reached $4.229, the highest since May
2008, when the commodity jumped to a record $4.2605.  Stockpiles  monitored by the London Metal Exchange have
gained 2.7 percent in the past three days to the highest level
since Nov. 23, exchange figures showed.  In London, copper for delivery in three months dropped $70,
or 0.8 percent, to $9,095 a metric ton ($4.13 a pound) on the
LME. Yesterday, the price rose to a record $9,267.50.  Tin, lead, aluminum and zinc also fell in London. Nickel
gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
