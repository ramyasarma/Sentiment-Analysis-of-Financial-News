As much as 14 percent of Australia’s
canola crop may be unsuitable for crushing after heavy rains
hurt harvest quality and the damage will be assessed by
processors over the next week, according to an industry group.  “An as-yet-unknown quantity of weather-affected seed,
mostly sprouted, could place up to 300,000 tons at risk,” the
Sydney-based  Australian Oilseeds Federation  said in a report
today. The group raised its output estimate to 2.1 million
metric tons compared with November’s forecast of 2.045 million
tons and 1.9 million tons gathered last season, the report said.  Canola futures in Canada have gained 37 percent this year,
with global demand forecast to exceed output in 2010-2011,
slashing so-called  ending stockpiles  24 percent, according to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA. Storms in eastern
Australia caused some crops to sprout, cutting the oil content,
Oilseeds Federation Executive Director Nick Goddard said.  “What we are doing as an industry is determining what
level of sprouting is an acceptable level that still makes it
worthwhile to crush,” Goddard said by phone. Improved weather
this week would help crops dry out, he said.  January-delivery canola fell 1.2 percent to C$564.10 ($560)
a ton on the ICE Futures Canada exchange yesterday after earlier
reaching a two-year high of C$573.50. Soybeans in Chicago, also
crushed for oil and livestock feed, rose 0.3 percent to $13.095
a bushel at 1:08 p.m. Melbourne time.  Export Forecast  Canola exports may be 1.4 million tons in the year to June
30, up from 1.2 million a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences forecast in a
report yesterday. Shipments may account for about 15 percent of
world trade and rank second behind Canada, it said.  The Australian Oilseeds Federation raised its production
estimate after output in Western Australia, the largest-
producing state, was better than expected, offsetting cuts to
forecasts in eastern states because of the wet weather.  “Even though it is a troublesome season, the canola looks
like it will still come through reasonably well,” Goddard said.  In New South Wales, the second-largest producing state, oil
content was “very good” for the harvested crop, with quality
issues affecting crops yet to be collected, the group said.  World ending stockpiles of rapeseed, as canola is also
known, may be 5.7 million tons in 2010-2011 compared with 7.5
million tons a year earlier, the USDA said on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
