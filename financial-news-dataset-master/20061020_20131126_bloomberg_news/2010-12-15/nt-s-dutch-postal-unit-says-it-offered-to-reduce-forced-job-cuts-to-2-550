TNT NV offered the Dutch labor
unions to reduce the planned forced redundancies at its postal
unit to 2,550 from 3,100, the company said today in a newspaper
advertisement.  TNT Post will pay about 250 million euros in premiums and
additional contributions to its pension fund this year, which is
not sustainable if it won’t reorganize, the company said. Postal
volumes will further decline the coming years, TNT also said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
