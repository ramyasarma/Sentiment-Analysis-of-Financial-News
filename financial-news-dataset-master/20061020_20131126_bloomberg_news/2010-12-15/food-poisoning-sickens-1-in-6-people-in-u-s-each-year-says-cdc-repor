Almost 48 million people, or one in
six, are struck by food-poisoning each year, leading to 128,000
hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths, according to the  Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention .  Unidentified contaminants cause more than 38 million cases,
the Atlanta-based CDC said today. Known pathogens led by
norovirus strike in an additional 9.4 million illnesses
annually, according to the report.  The study marked the agency’s first comprehensive food-
poisoning estimates in more than a decade. CDC estimated in 1999
that  76 million  people contract  food-borne illnesses  in the U.S.
each year, with 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths.  This year’s estimates resulted largely from improved data
and methods, said  Christopher Braden , acting director of the
CDC’s division of foodborne, waterborne and environmental
diseases. The figures shouldn’t be seen as reflecting a
reduction in nationwide cases, Braden said today on a conference
call.  “These numbers are the now the most precise that we have
of estimates of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in the
United States,” Braden said. “These are, any way you cut it, a
lot of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, and there is
more that we need to do.”  Almost 56,000 hospitalizations in the U.S., and 1,351
deaths, result from known foodborne pathogens, according to the
new CDC report. Salmonella causes 35 percent of those
hospitalizations, and 28 percent of deaths, the study found.  A food-safety overhaul that cleared the Senate last month
before being tripped up by constitutional concerns has been
included in an “omnibus” legislation to fund the government
that’s now before Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
