     Dec. 15 (Bloomberg) --Cotton futures fell for the first
time in six sessions on speculation that demand will drop and
plantings will increase in the U.S. after prices surged 88
percent this year.  Acreage may expand at least 10 percent in the Southwest,
according to  John Robinson , a professor and extension economist
at Texas A&M University in College Station. Texas is the largest
cotton-producing state, and the U.S. is the world’s leading
exporter. Yesterday, the fiber traded 6 cents below the record
$1.5195 a pound.  “Current higher prices may slow purchases by overseas
importers and encourage U.S. farmers to increase crop acreage,”
said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , the general manager of research at IDO
Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Cotton for March delivery fell 2.35 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to settle at $1.4214 at 2:46 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest drop since Nov. 26. The price jumped 11
percent in the previous five sessions.  Today’s decline may be just “a little correction,” said
 Keith Brown , the president of Keith Brown & Co., a brokerage in
Moultrie, Georgia. “The trend is still up. Until we either see
a collapse of demand or a huge infusion of new supply, we’re
going to stay volatile and bullishly slanted.”  Prices headed for the biggest annual gain since 1973 as
growers struggled to meet mounting demand from China, the
world’s biggest consumer. The fiber rose to the record on Nov.
