Swift Transportation Co. , the
biggest truckload carrier in North America, raised $806 million
after cutting the price for the second-largest U.S. initial
public offering of 2010.  The  trucking company  sold 73.3 million shares for $11 each
yesterday, after offering 67.3 million at $13 to $15 apiece,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The IPO raised about 20
percent less than it originally sought. Swift Transportation,
which began trading today under the ticker SWFT, fell 0.6
percent to $10.93 at 12:05 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.  Jerry Moyes , the co-founder of Swift who regained control
in a $2.37 billion leveraged buyout in 2007, completed an IPO of
the Phoenix-based company to help repay debt after it posted
$678 million in  losses . At the original midpoint price, Swift
Transportation would have been worth about 25 percent less than
the company Moyes took private, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “There’s a lot of noise around this deal that I’m sure
gave investors pause,” said  Michael Yoshikami , who oversees $1
billion at YCMNet Advisors in Walnut Creek, California. “The
biggest one is the fact that they’ve been continually losing
money. The fact that they had to cut the price doesn’t surprise
me at all.”  Morgan Stanley  in New York, Bank of America Corp. of
Charlotte, North Carolina, and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &
Co. led the offering.  2007 Buyout  The original midpoint price would have given Swift
Transportation a market value of $1.78 billion. Moyes paid about
the same amount in May 2007 for the  74 percent equity stake  that
he didn’t already own, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, which had 16,200 tractors and 48,600 trailers
in North America as of September, posted a  net loss  of $77
million for the first three quarters of 2010, its filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission showed.  Moyes, 66, co-founded the trucking company in 1966 and
originally took  Swift  public in 1990. He stepped down as
chairman and chief executive officer in October 2005 after
paying $1.5 million to settle an SEC case accusing him of
insider trading without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the
prospectus said.  The accusation related to his purchase of 187,000 Swift
shares in  May 2004 , days before the company announced better-
than-estimated earnings and the stock jumped 20 percent.  NHL Team  Moyes sold the National Hockey League’s  Phoenix Coyotes  to
the NHL for $140 million in November 2009 after the team filed
for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in May of that year.  In March, the NHL sued Moyes for breach of contract, aiding
and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and attempting to sell the
Coyotes without NHL consent, seeking damages of at least $60
million, the prospectus said. Moyes has filed a motion to
dismiss the NHL’s claims.  Dave Berry , the Swift Transportation vice president who
handles press inquiries for Moyes, said the CEO wasn’t
immediately available to comment.  Moyes, who graduated from  Weber State University  in Ogden,
Utah, in 1966 with a bachelor’s degree in business
administration, made $1.6 million as Swift Transportation’s CEO
over the past three years, the company’s prospectus said. He was
also chairman of Simon Transportation Services Inc., the
trucking company that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002.  Swift Transportation  had $2.33 billion more debt than cash
at the end of September and generated $341 million in earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the
first nine months of 2010, its prospectus said.  Relative Value  That would give Swift Transportation 5.13 times more net
debt than its cash flow over a full year, more than quadruple
the median net debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 1.12 for 23 U.S.-traded
trucking companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Neither  Werner Enterprises Inc.  of Omaha, Nebraska, nor
Phoenix-based  Knight Transportation Inc. , cited as Swift
Transportation’s competitors by Marina del Rey, California-based
IPOdesktop.com, had any debt at the end of September, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Separately,  Swift  increased the size of a term loan it’s
seeking to refinance debt and expects to price it at the tight-
end of its initial offering, according to two people familiar
with the negotiations.  The company boosted the size of the debt by $20 million to
$1.07 billion, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the terms are private. Swift also increased the size of
a bond offering by $10 million to $500 million after the IPO.  Loan Rate  Bank of America , Morgan Stanley and  Wells Fargo  are
arranging the loan, which will have an interest rate 4.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
one of the people said. Swift had offered a margin of as much as
4.75 percentage points over the lending benchmark.  The company’s stock offering was originally scheduled to
price on Dec. 14. The four IPOs completed that day were sold at
the low end of the forecast range or reduced even as the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  traded at a two-year high.  Detroit-based  General Motors Co.’s  $18.1 billion sale of
common shares last month was the biggest U.S. IPO this year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Three U.S. IPOs are scheduled for today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Fortegra Financial Corp. , the
Jacksonville, Florida-based insurance services company that
attempted to raise $123 million yesterday, will now try to sell
$66 million of shares after chopping its IPO by 46 percent,
according to its SEC filing and data compiled by Bloomberg.  QR Energy LP  of Houston plans to raise $315 million in its
IPO today, while New York-based Ventrus Biosciences Inc. is
selling $19.6 million of shares, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
