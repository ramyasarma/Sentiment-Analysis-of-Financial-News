Asian gasoil swaps fell to the
lowest in a week as the crack spread dropped, indicating reduced
profit for refiners. Fuel oil declined as crude extended losses
to below $88 a barrel in New York.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil , or diesel, swaps for January fell 65 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $102.20 a barrel at 11:10 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage. The
product’s premium to Dubai crude, the Asian benchmark, declined
60 cents to $13.87 a barrel. This  crack spread  has weakened
since reaching $15.43 on Dec. 7, the widest since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose for the first time this
month, gaining 15 cents to $1.20 a barrel, based on PVM data.
This  regrade  is down 27 percent so far this month, meaning it’s
less profitable to produce aviation fuel compared with diesel.  Fuel Oil  January  high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps dropped $2.25, or 0.4
percent, to $507 a metric ton, giving up all of yesterday’s
gains, according to PVM. Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude
widened 30 cents to $10.33 a barrel, indicating bigger losses
from making the residue. The discount was $7.28 at the end of
November.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade increased for the first time in six days, adding 25 cents
to $9.25 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity spread  has widened 16
percent so far in December, showing bunker, or marine fuel,
prices have climbed less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half January delivery were bid at $842.50 a
ton against offers at $845.50, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s little changed from yesterday’s
close of $843.  Naphtha’s crack spread to Brent crude rebounded $3.32 to
$159.14 a ton, the first increase this week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The difference has narrowed about 7
percent in December.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday slipped 10 cents to
$7.30 a barrel, Bloomberg calculations showed. This  reforming
margin  is up 55 percent far this month, signaling motor fuel
remained more profitable compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
