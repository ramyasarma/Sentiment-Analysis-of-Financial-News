Commodity assets under management
rose $11 billion last month to a record $354 billion, led by
demand for index-linked investments, Barclays Capital said.  Investment flows into products linked to commodity indexes
reached $3 billion in November,  Suki Cooper ,  Roxana Mohammadian Molina ,  Kevin Norrish  and  Amrita Sen , Barclays analysts based in
London, said today in a report. Total inflows into indexes,
medium-term notes and exchange-traded products were $6.1
billion.  New investments in 2010 are poised to reach $60 billion,
trailing only $76 billion in 2009, Barclays said.  The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate
close to zero percent since December 2008, and the U.S. central
bank plans to pump an additional $600 billion into the economy
through June by buying government bonds. The Fed purchased $1.7
trillion of securities in a phase that ended in March.  “We expect financial-market conditions in early 2011 to be
benign for commodities,” the analysts said. “Sustained
economic recovery, positive financial-market sentiment and
exceptionally easy monetary policy combine to provide a solid
platform for further price gains.”  In November, the  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19
raw materials rose 0.2 percent, the third straight gain. Silver,
gasoline and heating oil led the advances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
