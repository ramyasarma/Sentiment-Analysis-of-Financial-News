Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. , the world’s second-biggest shipyard, rose to
the highest in more than two years in Seoul trading after
announcing it received an order worth $1 billion.  The South Korean yard received an order to build five
warships for a Southeast Asian country, it said today in a
statement, without naming the buyer.  The contract follows the $1.1 billion order Daewoo
Shipbuilding announced earlier this month for a drill ship and
semi-submersible rig as a global economic recovery fuels demand
for vessels.  The shipbuilder  climbed  3.5 percent to 33,800 won, the
highest close since Aug. 29, 2008. The benchmark Kospi stock
index gained 0.4 percent to 2,017.48 at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
