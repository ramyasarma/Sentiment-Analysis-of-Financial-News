French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
popularity rose from a record low after the parliament passed
his proposal to raise the retirement age amid nationwide
demonstrations, a survey for  Liberation  daily showed.  Sarkozy’s approval rating gained 3 percentage points to 35
percent this month, while 61 percent said they disapproved of
his policies, according to the  Viavoice  survey.  Prime Minister  Francois Fillon ’s popularity rose 3 points
to 50 percent and 44 percent said they disapproved of him,
compared with 40 percent in November.  International Monetary Fund Chief  Dominique Strauss-Kahn 
remained the most popular politician among opposition parties,
the poll showed. Strauss-Kahn’s popularity added 5 points to 61
percent from November. He led other potential Socialist
candidates for the 2012 presidential race, including  Martine Aubry ,  Francois Hollande  and  Segolene Royal .  Paris-based Viavoice called 1,012 respondents aged 18 and
older on Dec. 9 and 10. It didn’t publish a margin of error.  To contact the reporters on this story:
