General Motors Co. , the automaker
that went bankrupt last year and returned to public trading in
November, paid $2.1 billion to taxpayers, completing the
repurchase of preferred shares issued under a U.S. government
bailout.  The transaction brings the total amount taxpayers have
received in return for their investment in  GM  to more than $23
billion, the Treasury Department said in a statement today.
Treasury invested $49.5 billion in Detroit-based GM.  The bailout of GM “was essential to preventing a
devastating collapse of the American auto industry and saving
more than 1 million American jobs,”  Tim Massad , acting
assistant secretary for financial stability, said according to
the statement.  Treasury in October accepted an offer from GM to repurchase
its preferred shares issued under the Troubled Asset Relief
Program. GM completed that transaction today, purchasing
Treasury’s 83,898,305 Series A shares at $25.50 a share,
according to the statement. Treasury’s stake in the automaker is
now made up of 500,065,254 shares of common stock.  Treasury gave out $389 billion under TARP and has received
$266.5 billion back in repayments, income from dividends,
interest and the sale of securities, the department said.
Treasury estimated in October that the total cost of TARP would
be $50 billion.  GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 1,
2009, after the failure of New York-based Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in September 2008 froze credit markets and helped
cause the longest recession since the Great Depression. The
company raised more than $20 billion in its return to public
stock trading Nov. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
