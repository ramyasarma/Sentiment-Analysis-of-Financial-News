As the Irish government inked a
rescue package to avert a debt default last month,  Haig Bathgate 
in Scotland loaded up on equities.  The chief investment officer at Turcan Connell took the
proportion of the Edinburgh-based firm’s 650 million pounds ($1
billion) of assets it invests for clients to about 65 percent in
stocks, the highest since mid-2008. The sovereign debt crisis in
Ireland and Greece are masking a “growth boom” elsewhere,
Bathgate said in an interview.  “We’re more bullish than at any point in the recent
past,” Bathgate said at his office in the Scottish capital on
Dec. 13. “You can feel you’re bipolar at the moment, going from
one extreme to the next.”  Turcan Connell’s conviction about the outlook for stocks
contrasts with larger money managers in the Scottish capital.
 Standard Life Investments , which oversees 154 billion pounds, is
neutral on most equity markets and prefers to benefit from
improved company earnings worldwide by holding corporate bonds,
a market Bathgate described as a “bubble.”  His rationale is that the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep
stimulating the economy, while European borrowing costs will
 stay lower  than previously forecast, helping countries such as
Germany, Bathgate said. Ireland was always going to be rescued
by the European Union and International Monetary fund after they
did the same for Greece in May, he said.  “There was an over-reaction to Europe,” Bathgate, 33,
said. “We’re in a risk-on phase at the moment.”  Credit Market  The euro fell against the dollar today after Moody’s
Investors Service said Spain’s debt rating is on review for a
possible downgrade. The European currency dropped 0.6 percent to
$1.3320 as of 10:19 a.m. in London.  The  MSCI World Index  of stocks dropped 2.4 percent in
November, the first decline in three months, as concern about
Ireland escalated before the government agreed to a rescue
package worth 85 billion euros ($114.5 billion).  The  Barclays Capital Global Aggregated Corporate Index  lost
3.5 percent in the same period, its worst month since October
2008. Junk, or non-investment grade bonds, fell 4.8 percent,
according to  Barclays’ Global High-Yield Index . That was the
biggest drop since May, the month Greece secured a bailout.  “There’s no value in corporate bonds” as faster inflation
in the U.K. becomes permanent, Bathgate said. “I’m convinced
they will sell off soon.”  Stock Funds  Turcan Connell, which caters to rich families and invests
in a range of assets, added about 15 million pounds to global
stock funds mainly during the last week of November as prices
declined, Bathgate said. The firm buys funds rather than
investing directly in companies, and put money into the  Schroder
Asian Total Return Fund , Bathgate said.  “You are in an environment where you have to change your
mind very quickly,” Bathgate said.  In addition, the company invested in a basket of a dozen
emerging-market currencies ranging from the Mexican peso to the
South Korean won with an equal bet on a decline in the dollar
and British pound, he said.  As Greece grappled with a debt crisis, Bathgate in March
said the pound might drop by more than 20 percent against the
dollar should Britain stage the next crisis as the country sold
record amounts of debt. Since then, the U.K. changed government
and promised budget cuts. The pound has rallied 5.2 percent
against the U.S. currency since March 1. That was mainly as the
Bank of England continued its purchases of bonds, a process
known as quantitative easing, Bathgate said.  Performance Ranking  The  CF TC Balanced Portfolio , a 21 million-pound mutual
fund that reflects Turcan Connell’s overall investments, has
risen 35.8 percent since Bathgate took charge in January 2009,
according to figures from Chicago-based research company
Morningstar Inc. The fund ranks 90th of 270 peers, with the
average increase at 33.6 percent, the data show.  In July, Turcan Connell took money out of hedge funds and
added 5 percent of its money to equities by purchasing funds,
including the  Sarasin International Equity Fund  and  BlackRock
Special Situations Fund , Bathgate said.  The impact of Greece and then Ireland on rates and the euro
has been beneficial for other parts of Europe, he said.  Economists expect the European Central Bank to start
lifting the cost of borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2011, a
year later than what they predicted in 2009, according to
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. The euro has dropped 6.6
percent against the dollar this year, helping exporters.  The  German economy  will expand 3.7 percent this year, the
government’s council of economic advisers forecast in November,
the fastest growth since 1991.  “The one-size-fits-all of the euro zone is working for
Germany at the moment,” Bathgate said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
