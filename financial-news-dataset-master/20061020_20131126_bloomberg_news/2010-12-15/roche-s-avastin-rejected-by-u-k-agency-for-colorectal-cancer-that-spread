Roche Holding AG ’s Avastin failed to
win the backing of the U.K. National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence for use in combination with chemotherapy
against colorectal cancer that has spread.  The drug’s benefits don’t justify the cost, the agency said
today in an e-mailed statement. The decision, which confirms
preliminary rulings by NICE, is final, the agency said.  “It is disappointing that, due to its current restraints
in methodology, NICE is unable to recommend Avastin for bowel
cancer, despite it being available in virtually every other
comparable country in the world,” Basel, Switzerland-based
Roche said in an e-mailed statement. “We are keen to work with
the appropriate authorities to determine the right long-term
solution to access to medicines.  Avastin can be paid for through the U.K.’s Cancer Drugs
Fund regardless of the medicine’s NICE approval status, Roche
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
