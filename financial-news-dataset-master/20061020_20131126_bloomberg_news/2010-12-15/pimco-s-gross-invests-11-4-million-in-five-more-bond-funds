Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
 Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest mutual fund, put
$11.4 million of his personal wealth into five closed-end funds
that invest in corporate debt after buying shares of five that
buy municipal bonds in the past week.  Gross yesterday purchased shares of Pimco Income Strategy
Fund, Pimco Income Strategy Fund II, Pimco High Income Fund,
Pimco Corporate Income Fund and Pimco Corporate Opportunity
Fund, according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. On Dec. 13 and 14, he more than doubled his
holdings in the funds to 2.37 million shares, filings show.  Gross, 66, who has beaten 98 percent of his peers in the
past five years overseeing the $250 billion  Pimco Total Return
Bond Fund , has invested about $17 million of his own money in
his firm’s closed-end funds over the past week. Closed-end funds
issue a fixed amount of shares that trade on an exchange.  Pimco, a unit of Munich-based insurer Allianz SE, manages
about $1.2 trillion in assets. Pimco Total Return advanced 7.4
percent this year through Dec. 14, topping 72 percent of rivals.  Mark Porterfield , a Pimco spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
