New York  state would face a $14
billion deficit for the year starting April 1 if it measured
with a more accurate system, Lieutenant Governor Richard Ravitch
said.  The state’s use of cash accounting, in which spending and
revenue are recorded only as they occur, is “misleading,”
Ravitch, 77, said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “InBusiness with Margaret Brennan.”  New York should use a version of generally accepted
accounting principles, in which expenditures and receipts are
recorded as they are incurred or earned even though they may not
have actually happened, he said. He made a similar proposal in
March.  “The real structural deficit, the difference between
recurring revenue and recurring expenditures, is far greater
than the published estimates of the deficit,” he said in the
television interview.  Using GAAP accounting, the state has an accumulated deficit
of $3.6 billion through the year that ends March 31, according
to a passage on page 73 of a 443-page budget  document .  For next year, the Division of Budget, using cash
accounting, projects New York’s  deficit  at $9 billion, assuming
that lawmakers close a $315 million gap for this year.  Revenue could be $1 billion less than spending this year,
Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said last month. Because lawmakers
are not acting to close that difference, next year’s gap could
be more than $11 billion, according to Dennis Tompkins, a
spokesman for DiNapoli.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
