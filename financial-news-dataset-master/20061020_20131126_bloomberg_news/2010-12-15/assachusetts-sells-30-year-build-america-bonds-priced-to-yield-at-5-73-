Massachusetts, which has the third-
highest per capita income among U.S. states, sold $576 million
in Build America Bonds with securities maturing in June 2040,
the bulk of the sale, priced to yield 5.73 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The rate is 115 basis points, or 1.15 percentage point,
above comparable-maturity U.S. Treasuries.  The bonds, top-rated by Moody’s Investors Service and
Standard & Poor’s, are backed by gasoline taxes and motor-
vehicle registration fees, according to preliminary offering
documents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
