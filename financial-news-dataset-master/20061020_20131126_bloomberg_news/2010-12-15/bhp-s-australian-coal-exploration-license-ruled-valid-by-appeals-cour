BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s right to explore
for coal in the Liverpool Plains, a farming region in the Hunter
Valley in Australia’s New South Wales state, was ruled valid by
an appeals court panel.  New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal Judge Murray Tobias,
 writing  on behalf of a three-member panel, today upheld a Land
and Environment Court ruling that said BHP’s coal-exploration
license was legal.  BHP, based in Melbourne, bought a five-year exploration
license from the New South Wales government for A$123 million
($122 million) in 2006. The  Caroona Coal Action Group , a
community organization opposed to mining over concerns it will
damage underground water systems, challenged the validity of the
license.  “We’re looking at our options,” Tim Duddy, a spokesman
for Caroona Coal, said today after the ruling was released.
“We’re not engaging in frivolous litigation.”  The mineral industry is the state’s biggest export industry,
accounting for 39 percent of all exports in the fiscal year
ended in 2007, according to a government  report.   The case is Caroona Coal Action Group Inc. v. Coal Mines
Australia Ltd. NSWCA 353. New South Wales Court of Appeal
(Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
