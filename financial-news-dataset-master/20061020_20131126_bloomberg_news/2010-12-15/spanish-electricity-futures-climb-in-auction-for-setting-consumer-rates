Spanish electricity futures rose in
an auction that will be used to set consumer power rates for the
first quarter.  Baseload power contracts for the first three months of 2011
were awarded at 49.07 euros ($65.38) per megawatt-hour compared
with 46.94 euros in the fourth quarter, the Spanish market
operator said in an e-mailed press release late yesterday.
Baseload power is delivered around the clock. Peak power rose to
53.99 euros from 53 euros.  Futures contracts for first-quarter power in Spain surged
about 12 percent in December compared with November ahead of the
auction. Spanish regulators are concerned that price increases
ahead of auctions boost costs for consumers while utilities
benefit from declining prices following the sale to increase
their profit margins, Cinco Dias newspaper said yesterday.  Homes pay a fixed tariff set each quarter on the basis of
the power auction plus an additional charge for use of the grid
that is determined by the government.  The government has set the grid charge below the cost of
delivering power every year since 2005, racking up debts of 14.6
billion euros that consumers must repay to power companies from
future bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
