Hong Kong has received 17 claims
related to alleged disruption of fung shui caused by the
construction of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail
Link, Secretary for Development Carrie Lam said.  Of the claims filed, 14 are seeking monetary payments, Lam
said in response to a question in the city’s Legislative Council
yesterday. Since 2007, the government has made HK$1.24 million
($159,500) of payments related to fung shui, she said.  The Works Branch of the Development Bureau is formulating
principles and procedures for dealing with fung shui claims for
reference by other government departments, Lam said.  Hong Kong’s government published a transcript of Lam’s
remarks on its website yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
