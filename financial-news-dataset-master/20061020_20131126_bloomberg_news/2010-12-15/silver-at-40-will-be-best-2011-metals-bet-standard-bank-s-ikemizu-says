Silver, the leading performer in
metals this year, is likely to repeat its success in 2011,
reaching $40 an ounce on new applications and industry demand,
said the head of commodity trading in Japan at Standard Bank Plc.  The precious metal will likely outpace next year’s gains in
gold, which should surpass $1,500 an ounce, and palladium,  Bruce Ikemizu  said today in an interview in Tokyo. “Unexpected” new
applications for silver, such as in solar batteries, and
industrial use that underpins 80 percent of demand, make the
metal attractive to “a lot of famous investors, especially in
the U.S.,” Ikemizu said, without giving more details.  Cotton alone has beaten silver in the UBS Bloomberg CMCI
commodity index this year, gaining 92 percent to the metal’s 76
percent. The precious metal touched a 30-year high earlier this
month to reach $30.7025 an ounce. Gold, which reached a record
$1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7, has advanced 27 percent this year.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  spurred further
gains in commodity prices, mostly denominated in U.S. dollars,
when he said on Dec. 6 that the Fed may expand bond purchases
beyond the $600 billion announced in November to prop up the
fragile recovery in the economy.  The outlook from Ikemizu, who has traded commodities for
more than 24 years and correctly forecast in June that gold will
surpass $1,300, broadly concurs with the 2011 view of Deutsche
Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG.  Credit Suisse sees silver averaging $30.10 an ounce, gold
$1,490 an ounce, and palladium $795 an ounce next year, the bank
said yesterday. Deutsche Bank has silver among its top 10
commodity trades in 2011, the bank said Dec. 13.  Silver holdings in ETPs rose for a fourth consecutive day
today, expanding 73 metric tons to 15,163 tons for their highest
level since at least February, data from four providers show.  Gold for immediate delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$1,389.05 an ounce at 3:29 p.m. in Tokyo. Silver for immediate
delivery declined 1 percent to $29.1625 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
