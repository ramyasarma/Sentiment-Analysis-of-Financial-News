France will delay until July the
introduction of a planned tax on online advertising revenue
that would hit companies such as  Google Inc.  and  Yahoo! Inc. ,
Budget Minister  Francois Baroin  said.  The French government will probably introduce a
legislative amendment delaying the introduction of the tax from
Jan. 1, Baroin told reporters in Paris. The delay would allow
more time “for discussion with the operators” of
telecommunications services, he said.  A report commissioned by France’s culture ministry this
year recommended imposing a tax on Internet ads and using the
proceeds to promote cultural content and pay artists. The levy
could raise as much as 20 million euros ($27 million) annually,
according to an estimate in the report.  While French regulators and cultural groups have clashed
with Google over copyright, privacy, and artist compensation,
the company has been attempting to cool tensions. This year it
signed accords with French artistic collection agencies and
pledged to build a research-and-development center in Paris.  To contact the reporters on this story:
