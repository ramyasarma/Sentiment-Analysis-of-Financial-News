Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ’s top
executives will get about $111.3 million in stock next month in
a delayed payout from last year and their record-setting 2007
awards, even as Wall Street prepares for lower bonuses.  Chief Executive Officer  Lloyd C. Blankfein , 56, is poised
to receive about $24.3 million in January, based on the closing
share price on Dec. 14, while President  Gary D. Cohn , 50, will
get about $24 million, company filings show. The payouts, just a
portion of the $67.9 million bonus awarded to Blankfein for 2007
and the $66.9 million paid to Cohn, reflect a 24 percent decline
in the stock’s value since it was granted at $218.86.  Within a year after the bonuses were approved, Goldman
Sachs took $10 billion of U.S. bailout funds, converted to a
bank and was borrowing as much as $35.4 billion a day from
Federal Reserve emergency programs. This year the New York-based
firm paid $550 million to settle U.S. regulators’ fraud charges
related to a mortgage security the company sold in 2007.  “Clearly we now look back and say, ‘Were things fine?
Should they have paid? Maybe not,’” said  Jeanne Branthover , a
managing director at recruitment firm Boyden Global Executive
Search in New York. “There’s nothing you can do about it. The
payouts were in stone. But hopefully, in the future, they won’t
be.”  Deferred Stock  Since the 2008 credit crisis wiped out competitors such as
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and led to unprecedented
government assistance to financial institutions, regulators have
encouraged banks to pay senior employees with deferred stock and
recoup payouts if trading strategies backfire. Blankfein and
Cohn, who received cash awards of $27 million and $26.6 million
respectively for 2007, didn’t get any bonuses for 2008 and
received only restricted stock for 2009.  Goldman Sachs announced on Dec. 10, 2009, that all 30
members of its management committee would receive only
restricted stock for their year-end bonuses. The company hasn’t
made a similar announcement this year. Through the first nine
months of 2010, Goldman Sachs set aside $13.1 billion to cover
compensation and benefits expenses, or enough to pay each of its
35,400 employees $370,706 apiece. A year earlier, the average
was $527,192 per employee.  The payments come as bonuses across Wall Street are
expected to decline. Compensation for trading and investment-
banking employees is likely to be down 22 percent to 28 percent
from last year, according to Options Group, an executive search
and compensation consultant firm in New York.  Morgan Stanley  has
told some employees to expect investment-banking bonuses to
decline 10 percent to 30 percent, two people briefed on the
matter said earlier this month.  Record Profit  Goldman Sachs’s 23 percent share-price  decline  from the
last day of 2007 compares with a 16 percent drop in the Standard
& Poor’s 500  Index  over the same period and a 47 percent plunge
in the  S&P 500 Financials Index . While the firm’s profit tumbled
80 percent in 2008 from the $11.6 billion earned in 2007, last
year the company recovered to post a $13.4 billion  record
profit . So far this year earnings have been lower.  Among the scheduled January payouts are $21.3 million to
Chief Financial Officer  David Viniar ; $20.8 million to former
co-president  Jon Winkelried , who left the firm in March 2009;
and $14.3 million to  Edward C. Forst , co-head of investment
management, who left in 2008 and returned to Goldman Sachs a
year later.  The amounts are based on the Dec. 14 closing share price of
$167.33, which is likely to change by the time the stock is
delivered next month.  David Wells , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment.  Dimon, Mack  JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO  Jamie Dimon , 54, is set to receive
$6.8 million worth of shares next month that were awarded for
2007.  John Mack , 66, who served as CEO of New York-based Morgan
Stanley until this year, didn’t take a bonus in 2007, 2008 or
2009. He will receive about $5.4 million of previously vested
shares in January that Morgan Stanley awarded him for 2005.  Of the $111.3 million in restricted stock awards due to be
doled out in January, $94.9 million was from 2007 grants, the
filings show. While Vice Chairmen  John S. Weinberg  and  J. Michael Evans  will each receive $3.3 million from their 2009
bonus grants, their 2007 awards weren’t published in the proxy.  Buffett Agreement  The executives will be restrained from cashing in the stock
they receive. Blankfein, Cohn, Winkelried and Viniar were all
required to keep 90 percent of their shares under an agreement
reached with  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , the company controlled by
billionaire  Warren Buffett , when it bought $5 billion of the
firm’s preferred stock in 2008. That limit expires when
Buffett’s investment is repaid or on Oct. 1, 2011, whichever
comes soonest.  Even before the Buffett restrictions were imposed, Goldman
Sachs’s CEO, CFO, presidents and vice chairmen were required to
keep at least 75 percent of the shares they had received since
becoming senior executive officers, with the exception of shares
received in Goldman Sachs’s 1999 initial public offering or
through any acquisition by Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley and
JPMorgan also require top executives to retain 75 percent of the
shares they are awarded.  About 88 percent of the 2007 awards were restricted stock
units the firm granted for performance, which were vested at
that time. The  executives  receive the  shares  underlying those
units in January 2011. The remaining 12 percent are shares the
executives purchased at a 25 percent discount using their 2007
cash bonuses. Those shares are either delivered or have
restrictions lifted next month.  Stock Options  The executives also received stock options in 2007 that
become exercisable in January. The  options , which expire on Nov.
24, 2017, are unlikely to be exercised immediately because the
shares are below the strike price of $204.16.  The January bonus awards will probably trigger varying
reactions among different groups of people, Branthover said.  “The public will be outraged,” she said. “Wall Streeters
will be excited that there’s still money being made on Wall
Street, and there’s still a reason to be working so hard.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
