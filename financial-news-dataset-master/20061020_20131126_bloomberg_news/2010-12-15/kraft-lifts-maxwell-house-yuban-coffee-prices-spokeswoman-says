Kraft Foods Inc. raised the price of
its Maxwell House and Yuban coffee in the U.S. for the third
time this year as the cost of beans surged.  Ground-coffee prices were boosted by 12 percent, or 35
cents a pound, and instant coffee rose 4 percent,  Bridget MacConnell , a Kraft spokeswoman, said by telephone from
Tarrytown, New York. The increases were mainly due to a
“significant and sustained” jump in commodity costs, she said.  Coffee futures have jumped 61 percent in New York this year
on concern that global supplies may lag behind demand. Arabica
coffee for March delivery advanced 1.95 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.1865 a pound at 11:40 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.  Northfield, Illinois-based Kraft, had raised U.S. prices on
some types of Maxwell House and Yuban coffee in May and August.  Arabica coffee is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed
by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly in Asia and parts
of Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
