Deutsche Bank AG  won dismissal of a
lawsuit filed by  Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.  claiming
the bank omitted key facts in selling it $69.5 million of
auction-rate securities.  U.S. District Judge  Alvin Hellerstein  in New York today
dismissed the claims, determining they were “time-barred.”  Teva bought the securities, which a unit of  Deutsche Bank 
underwrote, according to court filings. Teva sold the securities
back to Deutsche Bank at a “steep discount” as allowed under
the purchase agreement, and sued in July 2009, arguing,
according to court documents, that the securities weren’t exempt
from regulatory registration as Deutsche Bank claimed.  In January, Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Bank  agreed to buy
back $7.8 million of auction-rate securities from  North Carolina 
investors whose holdings had been trapped since the market for
the debt collapsed in February 2008.  In a 2009 settlement, Deutsche Bank paid a $15 million fine
and said it would repurchase $1 billion in stranded auction-rate
securities. The agreement ended a criminal probe into six banks
by  New York  Attorney General  Andrew Cuomo .  Denise Bradley , a spokeswoman for Teva in U.S., didn’t
immediately return a call or e-mail seeking comment after
regular business hours. Teva is based in Petah Tikva, Israel.  The case is Teva Pharmaceuticals v. Deutsche Bank,
09-06205, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
