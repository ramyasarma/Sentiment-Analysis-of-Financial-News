Kenya’s shilling reversed gains
before an announcement later today by the International Criminal
Court that is expected to identify six of the main suspects
allegedly involved in post-election violence in 2008.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.8 percent to 79.88 per dollar and was trading at 80.65
shillings at 11:57 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital. It closed at
80.50 yesterday.  “The market is playing cautious ahead of the International
Criminal Court expected announcement on those to be indicted for
the post-election violence,” Steve Lagat, a trader at  CFC
Stanbic Holdings Ltd.  in Nairobi, said in a phone interview.  ICC Chief Prosecutor  Luis Moreno-Ocampo  said earlier this
month he will file cases against six Kenyans for committing
crimes against humanity during the two months of ethnic clashes
that followed a disputed presidential election in December 2007.
As many as 1,500 people were killed and 300,000 others displaced
in the fighting.  The announcement is expected to be made at 12 p.m. in The
Hague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
