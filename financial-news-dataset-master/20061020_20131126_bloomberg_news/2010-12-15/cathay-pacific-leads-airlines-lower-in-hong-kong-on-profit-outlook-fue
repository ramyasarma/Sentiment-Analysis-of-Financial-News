Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.  led
declines in Chinese carriers in Hong Kong trading after an
industry group said slower global economic growth and rising
fuel costs may hurt airline profits next year.  Cathay , Hong Kong’s biggest carrier, fell as much 6.8
percent, the biggest intraday decline since Jan. 22, to
HK$22.10. The stock was at HK$22.25 at the 12:30 p.m. trading
break in the city.  Ctrip.com International Ltd. , a consolidator
of hotel and airline bookings in China, fell 13 percent, the
most since July 6, to $38.64 in Nasdaq trading yesterday.  Airlines  in 2011 may post a 40 percent decline in combined
profit to $9.1 billion from $15.1 billion this year,
 International Air Transport Association  Chief Executive Officer
 Giovanni Bisignani  said in Geneva yesterday. Profit margin will
fall by almost half to 1.5 percent, while revenue is set to grow
5.8 percent to $598 billion, he said.  “There are some concerns whether airlines such as Cathay
can sustain the stellar growth of this year into 2011,” said
 Kelvin Lau , an analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research in Hong
Kong. “The industry is cyclical and issues such as higher fuel
costs and slowing traffic can dampen earnings growth.”  Cathay’s November passenger traffic rose 8.7 percent, the
slowest expansion in at least four months, and freight volume
gained 8.4 percent.  “While it is still much too early to tell, we are
concerned that this may be the first sign of overcapacity,”
 Andrew Orchard , an airline analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland
Plc, wrote in a note to clients today.  Air China Ltd. , the nation’s largest international carrier
and part-owned by Cathay, carried 8.3 percent more passengers in
November than a year earlier, the slowest growth in at least
five months, its data showed.  Air China fell 3.6 percent to HK$8.56.  China Eastern
Airlines Corp.  declined 2.6 percent to HK$3.82 and  China
Southern Airlines Co.  dropped 2.1 percent to HK$4.60.  Oil prices have risen 29 percent from the year’s low of
$68.01 a barrel on May 20. The January crude oil futures
contract fell 0.4 percent to $87.89 a barrel in electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
