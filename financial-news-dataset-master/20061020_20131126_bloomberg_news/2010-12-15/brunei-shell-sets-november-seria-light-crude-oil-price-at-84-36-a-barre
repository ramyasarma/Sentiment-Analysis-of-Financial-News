Brunei Shell Petroleum Co., the
Southeast Asian country’s biggest oil producer, reduced
official crude selling prices for the first time in three months
on reduced profits from making naphtha.  The company posted its  Seria Light Export Blend  at $84.36 a
barrel retroactively for November, an official, who asked not to
be identified because of company policy, said today in a mobile
text message. That’s a drop of $4.85, or 5.4 percent, from
October. The  Champion  grade, fixed at 15 cents below Seria
Light, sold for $84.21.  Refining profits for naphtha, used to make gasoline or
petrochemicals, has declined as crude costs surged. Naphtha’s
premium to Brent crude, known as the crack spread, is trading
this week below $158 a metric ton, down more than 8 percent so
far this month. Brent crude on Dec. 7 climbed above $92 a
barrel, the highest in 26 months. Seria Light is refined mainly
for naphtha, kerosene and gasoil.  Brunei Shell Petroleum is a joint venture between  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc  and the Brunei government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
