President Barack Obama said he’s
“absolutely convinced” that the compromise tax package being
debated in Congress will help the U.S. economy grow and he urged
lawmakers to pass it as quickly as possible.  Obama said he also wants to solicit ideas about ways to
accelerate the recovery from the 20 chief executive officers
he’s meeting with this morning in Washington.  Obama said he plans to discuss tax reform, regulations and
how to encourage them to invest “when they’re holding
nearly $2 trillion on their books.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
