Natural gas futures climbed in New
York, reversing an earlier decline, after the Federal Reserve
reported that U.S. industrial production rose more than
forecast, signaling economic growth that may boost fuel demand.  Natural gas for January delivery rose 1.5 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $4.27 per million British thermal units at 9:31 a.m.
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have rise 2
percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
