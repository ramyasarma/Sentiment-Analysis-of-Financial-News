Copper declined for a second day,
erasing an advance in early Asian trading, as some investors
sold the metal to lock in gains after it climbed to a record
yesterday, and as the dollar’s rebound reduced the appeal of
commodities as alternative investments.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.4 percent to $9,130 a metric ton, and
traded at $9,133.75 by 2:16 p.m. Singapore time. Earlier the
contract rose as much as 0.9 percent. It reached a record
$9,267.50 a ton yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
