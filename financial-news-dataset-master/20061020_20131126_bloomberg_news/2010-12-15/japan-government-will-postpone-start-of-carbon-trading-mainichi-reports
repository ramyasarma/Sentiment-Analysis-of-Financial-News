Japan’s government plans to postpone
the start of carbon trading because of uncertainty about the
future of an international framework to tackle climate change,
the Mainichi newspaper  reported , without citing anyone.  The ruling Democratic Party of Japan is also concerned
about the impact on domestic businesses from carbon trading,
which was tentatively scheduled to be introduced sometime in the
fiscal year ending March 2014, the paper said.  The newspaper didn’t say when emissions trading is
expected to start in Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
