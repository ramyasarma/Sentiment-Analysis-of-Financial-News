The Glendale, Arizona, City Council
voted 5-2 to approve a new arena lease for the National Hockey
League’s Phoenix Coyotes that will cost taxpayers $197 million,
according to the  team’s Web site .  The agreement requires the city to purchase the team’s
parking rights for $100 million, raised through bonds, and pay
 Matthew Hulsizer ’s ownership group $97 million to help manage
Jobing.com Arena.  Hulsizer, chief executive officer of Chicago-based
investment firm  Peak6 Investments LP , will use the money he
received for parking rights to help purchase the team from the
NHL for $170 million. Parking used to be free, but the 5,500
spaces will now be sold for between $5 and $20 to help recoup
the city’s investment, according to a report in the  Arizona
Republic .  “This vote is another step towards securing our future in
Glendale and we remain optimistic that a deal will be finalized
soon,” the Coyotes said in a statement last night.  NHL Commissioner  Gary Bettman  said the league’s board of
governors executive committee will recommend that Hulsizer be
approved for ownership. He also said the city would land an All-
Star Game in the next three years, probably in 2013.  The NHL bought the team in 2009 after former owner  Jerry Moyes  filed for bankruptcy. Hulsizer will be the team’s fourth
owner since it was moved to Arizona from Winnipeg in 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
