Canadian factory  sales  increased
more than economists forecast in October, led by gains for
petroleum, metals and automobiles.  Sales rose 1.7 percent to C$45.5 billion ($45.2 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists in a
Bloomberg News  survey  predicted a 1 percent increase, based on
the median of 20 estimates.  Sales have gained 19 percent since touching a low of C$38.3
billion in May 2009 during a recession. Lumber futures prices
have rebounded from their lows set in June and automobile
production has increased after Chrysler Group LLC and General
Motors Co. restarted production following their exits from
bankruptcy.  “It was a positive report,” said Sonya Gulati, economist
at Toronto-Dominion Bank, in a telephone interview. She said a
strong Canadian dollar and an uneven global recovery “will slow
things down going into 2011.”  The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to C$1.0038
per U.S. dollar at 10:14 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0062
yesterday.  The currency has traded at close to parity with the U.S.
dollar for most of this year, making the country’s goods more
expensive abroad and encouraging companies to import equipment
to stay competitive. Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said
two days ago that the country has “challenges with
competitiveness” and companies must boost investment to drive
exports.  Cars, Metals Sales  Motor vehicle sales rose 3.7 percent to C$3.7 billion,
Statistics Canada said today. Primary metal sales rose 5.8
percent to C$3.8 billion and petroleum and coal increased 4.3
percent to C$6 billion.  Sales rose in 14 of  21 categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada, representing 80 percent of the total. Excluding
automobiles and parts, sales rose 1.4 percent to C$40.2 billion,
Statistics Canada said.  New  factory orders  rose 3 percent to C$44.8 billion, and
unfilled orders decreased 1.4 percent to C$52.5 billion.  Inventories rose 0.3 percent to C$60.4 billion, while the
 ratio of inventories to sales , a measure of how many months it
would take to deplete stockpiles, fell to 1.33 from 1.35.  Statistics Canada reduced its estimate of the factory sales
decrease for September to 0.5 percent from an earlier report of
0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
