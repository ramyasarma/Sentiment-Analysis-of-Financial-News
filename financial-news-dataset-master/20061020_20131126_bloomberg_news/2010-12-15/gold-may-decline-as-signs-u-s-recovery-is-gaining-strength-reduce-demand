Gold fell the most in a week on
speculation that the dollar will extend a rally, eroding demand
for the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback rose against the euro and the yen as U.S.
economic data pointed to a recovering economy with a low
inflation rate. The U.S. consumer-price index increased 0.1
percent in November. Gold has gained 26 percent this year,
reaching a record $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7.  “As economic activity looks to improve, that’s going to
strengthen the dollar and hurt gold,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader
at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “The inflation numbers
also took gold down a little bit. If you’re buying these
commodities to hedge against inflation, today’s data didn’t show
that you were right in doing so yet.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell $18.10, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1,386.20 at 2:02 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. It was the biggest decline for the most-active contract
since Dec. 8.  U.S. industrial production rose 0.4 percent in November,
more than forecast, government data showed.  Yesterday, the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest
rate at zero percent to 0.25 percent and maintained it will
continue with a plan to buy back $600 billion in bonds through
June.  ‘Risk Capital’  “In an environment where central banks in the
industrialized world are keeping interest rates low, gold can
continue to compete aggressively for risk capital,” analysts at
Deutsche Bank AG said in a report.  Still, some investors today were betting on higher interest
rates in the future. Treasury 30-year bonds fell, pushing the
yield to a seven-month high.  “As interest rates rise, the dollar is going to scream
higher and all the metals are going to come down hard,” said
 Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset Management in
Evanston, Illinois.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell 4.83 metric
tons to 2,091.56 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 53.5 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $29.253 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has gained
74 percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery dropped $15.55, or 2
percent, to $752.65 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $9.50, or 0.6
percent, to $1,704.40 an ounce.  Palladium has surged 84 percent this year, and platinum is
up 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
