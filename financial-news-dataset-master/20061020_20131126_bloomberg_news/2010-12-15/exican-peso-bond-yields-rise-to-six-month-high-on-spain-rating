Mexico’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields to a six-month high, as demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market debt waned after Moody’s Investors Service said
it may cut Spain’s credit rating.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 climbed
to the highest since June 1, rising 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 7.50 percent, according to Banco Santander
SA. The price fell 1.44 centavos to 121.57 centavos per peso.
The yields had the biggest single-day gain in a week.  “There is a lot of bearish news concerning a possible
downgrade of Spain and that has led to some risk aversion,”
said  Aryam Vazquez , an economist with Wells Fargo & Co. in New
York.  Moody’s said it is reviewing Spain’s Aa1 credit rating for
a possible downgrade as the European nation prepares to sell
bonds tomorrow.  The peso dropped 0.6 percent to 12.4571 per dollar from
12.3880 yesterday. The currency has advanced 5.1 percent this
year against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
