Electrolux AB , the world’s second-
largest home-appliance maker, said it will close a cooking
product factory in Quebec, Canada, and cut 800 European jobs as
one of the final acts of its eight-year effort to shift
manufacturing to countries with lower production costs.  Electrolux will close the factory in l’Assomption, Quebec,
in 2013, affecting 1,300 workers, the company said in a
statement. In Europe, jobs will be cut at its major appliances
industrial operations in 2011 and 2012. Electrolux, which didn’t
say where in Europe the workforce will be reduced, said it will
charge a total of 850 million kronor ($124 million) against
fourth-quarter earnings.  “Production in L’Assomption will be transferred to a new
facility, the location of which will be announced shortly,” the
maker of Frigidaire refrigerators said in the statement.  Electrolux, which competes with top appliance maker
 Whirlpool Corp ., in 2004 began an effort to shift much of its
production to lower-cost countries. The program is expected to
be completed next year and will cost a total of about 8.5
billion kronor, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company said. It
should generate annual  savings  of 3.4 billion kronor starting in
2013, it said.  Chief Executive Officer  Hans Straaberg , who initiated the
restructuring program, will step down at the end of the year. He
will be succeeded by  Keith McLoughlin , now responsible for
research and development, manufacturing and purchasing at the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
