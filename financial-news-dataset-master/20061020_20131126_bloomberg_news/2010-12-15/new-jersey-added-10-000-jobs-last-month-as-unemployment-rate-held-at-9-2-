New Jersey added 10,000 jobs in
November as companies hired more workers, while the state said
the unemployment  rate  remained at 9.2 percent.  Employment climbed by 9,300 jobs at businesses and 700 in
the public sector, the state’s Labor and Workforce Development
Department said today in a  statement . New Jersey’s nongovernment
employers have added jobs in five of the past six months,
boosting their total by 10,700 so far in 2010, compared with the
loss of 115,600 jobs in the same period of last year.  New Jersey’s  jobless rate  reached a recession high of 10
percent in December 2009, the department said. The October and
November rate of 9.2 percent is the lowest since May 2009. The
 national  unemployment rate climbed to 9.8 percent last month
from 9.6 percent in October.  “The report on private-sector employment is very hopeful,
and the trend is becoming consistently positive,”  Michael Drewniak , a spokesman for Governor Chris Christie, said by e-
mail. “There’s a lot of work to be done, but we take this as a
signal to press on with the administration’s policies to keep
and attract businesses so that New Jersey can lead the way out
of recession.”  The last time the state added 10,000 or more jobs in a
month was in April, when employment increased by 11,700 from
March, according to Kevin Smith, a department spokesman.  Among government employers in New Jersey, 1,100 jobs were
added at the local level and 100 by federal agencies, while
state employment fell by 500.  Jobs were added in seven of 10 industry groups last month,
the state said. Construction had the biggest gain, increasing by
4,500, while professional and business-service employment
climbed by 3,900, the department said. Leisure and hospitality
industries cut 4,500 positions, while trade, transportation and
utilities employment declined by 2,900.  To contact the reporter on this story:
