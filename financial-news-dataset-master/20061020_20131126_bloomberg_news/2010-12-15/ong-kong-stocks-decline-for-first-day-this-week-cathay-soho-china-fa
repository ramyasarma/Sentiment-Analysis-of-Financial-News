Hong Kong’s benchmark stock index 
fell the most in three weeks as airlines dropped on concern
profits will decline, and developers slid after a report that
lawmakers will take more steps to curb home prices in China.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Hong Kong’s largest carrier,
tumbled 7.2 percent after the International Air Transport
Association said combined airline profits may drop 40 percent
next year. Soho China Ltd., central Beijing’s biggest developer,
slid 0.8 percent. PetroChina Co., the nation’s largest oil
company, decreased 3.6 percent after the price of crude dropped.  “Concerns over tightening make people worry about an
economic slowdown,” said  Steve Tse , a research manager at BEA
Union Investment Management in Hong Kong. “Airlines would be
the first to get hit. Stock markets are likely to stay range-
bound towards yearend.”  The  Hang Seng Index  fell 2 percent to close at 22,975.35,
its sharpest drop since Nov. 23. Declines deepened after Moody’s
Investors Service placed Spain’s credit ratings on review for
possible downgrade.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies lost 2.2 percent to 12,585.04.  The Hang Seng Index has climbed 5 percent this year on
expectations that growth in corporate earnings will overcome
concerns about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and
China’s steps to curb rising property prices. Shares in the
gauge trade at an average 14.4 times estimated earnings,
compared with about 17.2 times at the start of the year.  Airlines Fall  Cathay Pacific  slumped 7.2 percent to HK$22, the biggest
decline on the Hang Seng Index. Air China Ltd., the world’s
largest carrier by market value, sank 5.9 percent to HK$8.36.  Airlines may post a 40 percent decline in combined profits
next year on slower economic growth, higher fuel costs and
austerity measures in Europe, International Air Transport

Properties Co., a mainland developer, fell 1.1 percent to
HK$10.84. KWG Property Holding Ltd., a property developer in
China, declined 1.1 percent to HK$6.23.  Beijing may introduce extra measures aimed at curbing home-
price gains in the city, including ones related to taxes and the
availability of credit, the China Daily reported today, citing
Xu Zhijun, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Commission of
Housing and Urban-Rural Development.  PetroChina  fell 3.6 percent to HK$9.64. Cnooc Ltd., China’s
largest offshore oil producer, slipped 2.8 percent to HK$17.96.  Crude-oil futures declined 0.4 percent to $88.28 a barrel
