Bharti Airtel Ltd. , the Indian
mobile-phone company with operations in 15 African countries,
will begin operating a money-transfer service in  Madagascar 
today to tap demand for financial services among the “unbanked.”  The service will compete with  Orange SA ’s Orange Money and
the M-Vola product offered by  Telma , the state-run phone
company, Heiko Schlittke, director of Airtel’s Malagasy unit,
said in an interview yesterday in the capital, Antananarivo.  The company is targeting 3.2 million mobile-phone customers
on the Indian Ocean island nation by the end of 2011, compared
with 2 million now, he said. Airtel plans to invest $50 million
in the country over the next 18 months.  “I expect 90 percent of our customers to be using Airtel
Money in one way or another by July 2011”, Schlittke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
