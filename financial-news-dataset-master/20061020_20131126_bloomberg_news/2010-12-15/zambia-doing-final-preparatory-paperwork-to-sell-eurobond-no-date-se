Zambia is doing the final
preparations to sell a Eurobond, though there isn’t a date set
for the sale, Finance Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane  said.  “We have reached a stage where the final preparatory
paperwork is being done,” Musokotwane told reporters today in
the capital, Lusaka. “I can’t put a timeframe to it,” he said.  Zambia, Africa’s biggest copper producer, postponed in 2008
a plan to seek a credit rating and sell its first global bond of
$1 billion because of the global financial crisis.  Musokotwane also didn’t say how much the country planned to
sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
