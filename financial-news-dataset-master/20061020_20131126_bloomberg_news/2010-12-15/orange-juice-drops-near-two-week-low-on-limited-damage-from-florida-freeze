Orange-juice futures dropped to the
lowest price in almost two weeks on signs that damage to citrus
groves in Florida, the world’s second-biggest grower, was less
severe than expected.  While some damage occurred, the areas where temperatures
dropped below 28 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius) for more
than four hours was “somewhat restricted,” World Weather Inc.
said today in an e-mailed report. Prices surged to a three-year
high on Dec. 13 as freezing weather threatened orange groves.  “The initial assessment shows that there has been minimal
damage,” said  Jodi Timmons , a vice president at Global
Commodity Futures LLC in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “There are
talks about temperatures dipping later this week, but it may not
be damaging to the crop.”  Orange juice for January delivery fell 2.55 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $1.575 a pound at 9:23 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York, after slipping to $1.535, the lowest price for a most-
active contract since Dec. 2. Yesterday, the most-active
contract slumped 4.1 percent.  On Dec. 13, the price surged by the exchange limit of 10
cents to $1.706, the highest since May 9, 2007, after Florida
declared a state of emergency amid severe cold that threatened
to damage crops.  The state will produce 143 million boxes of oranges in the
harvest that began in October and runs into July, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said on Dec. 10. That was down from an
October estimate of 146 million boxes.  Last year, output dropped to 133.6 million boxes, the
second-smallest crop in two decades, after a January freeze
damaged fruit. A box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  Brazil is the world’s biggest grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
