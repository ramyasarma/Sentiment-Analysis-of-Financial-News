Volkswagen AG  is recalling 377,286
cars in the U.S., including Beetle and Jetta models, citing fire
risk from fuel-supply lines that may chafe and leak.  Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, is recalling
Jetta, Jetta SportWagen, Golf, Rabbit, New Beetle and New Beetle
Convertible cars, it said in a letter posted today on the U.S.
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website.  “It’s a voluntary safety recall,” said  Kerry Christopher ,
a spokesman for Volkswagen at its U.S. headquarters in Herndon,
Virginia. “There haven’t been any reports of injuries or fires
that have resulted from this.”  The recall applies to model years 2007 to 2009 of Jettas,
Golfs and Rabbits and model years 2006 to 2010 of Beetles.  Some Jettas from the 2009 model year are also under
investigation by the U.S. auto-safety regulator after it
received reports of engines stalling without warning while the
cars are moving.  To contact the reporter on this story:
