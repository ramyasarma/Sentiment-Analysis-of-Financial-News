Nigeria  sold $800 million of foreign
currency at an auction today, below the  year-high demand  of
$837.78 million, according to the central bank.  “Demand is this high because multinational companies and
other investors want to make end-of-year remittances back to
their head offices abroad,” Babatunde Obaniyi, an analyst at
Lagos-based  Afrinvest West Africa Ltd. , said by phone. “Demands
for dollars may remain high till the end of the year.”  Dollars were sold for between 149.06 naira and 150 naira,
the Abuja-based Central Bank of Nigeria said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
