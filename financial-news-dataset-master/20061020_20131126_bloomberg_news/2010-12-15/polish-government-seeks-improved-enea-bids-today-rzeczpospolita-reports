Poland’s Treasury Ministry is
seeking improved offers by today for a 51 percent stake in the
country’s third-largest utility  Enea SA ,  Rzeczpospolita 
reported, citing two unnamed persons close to the transaction.  The Polish government last month ended exclusive talks with
Kulczyk Holding SA, owned by Polish billionaire  Jan Kulczyk ,
over the sale and returned to negotiations with other bidders
that placed offers for Enea in October.  GDF Suez  is not going to refile its bid as it is not
interested any more in buying a controlling stake in the Polish
utility, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources.  Only Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS of the Czech
Republic has declared that it would upgrade its offer,
Rzeczpospolita said. The remaining bidders are Kulczyk Holding
and  Electricite de France SA , it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
