EVA Airways Corp. , Taiwan’s second-
biggest carrier, agreed to invest 328 million yuan ($49 million)
in China Eastern Airlines Corp.’s cargo unit as its mainland
partner restructures freight operations following a takeover.  EVA will get a 16 percent stake in China Cargo Airlines
following the deal and it will also quit a venture with Shanghai
Airlines Co., the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based carrier said in stock
exchange statement today. China Cargo plans to raise a total
2.05 billion yuan, according to the statement.  The deal paves the way for China Eastern to combine three
cargo carriers following its takeover of Shanghai Air in
January. The Shanghai-based carrier expects to reach agreements
with other venture partners, which include  Singapore Airlines
Ltd. ’s cargo unit, this month, Board Secretary Luo Zhuping said
Dec. 6.  The EVA Air deal is part of the restructuring, Luo said
today, declining to elaborate further on the progress of the
plan. The carrier intends to combine the operations of China
Cargo, Shanghai Air’s freight business and of Great Wall
Airlines Co. EVA owned 25 percent of the Shanghai Air freight
venture.  China Eastern was due to receive its parent’s 51 percent
stake in Great Wall this year, Chairman Liu Shaoyong said in
March. Singapore Air’s cargo unit owns 25 percent of Great Wall,
while Temasek Holdings Pte, a Singapore state-owned investment
company, holds the rest. China Eastern is already managing
operations.  To contact the reporter on the story:
