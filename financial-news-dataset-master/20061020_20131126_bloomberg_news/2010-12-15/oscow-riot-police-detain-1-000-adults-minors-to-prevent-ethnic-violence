Moscow riot police detained about
1,000 people suspected of planning acts of ethnic violence at
rival rallies in the Russian capital today.  “A lot of them are minors so we will call in their parents
and work with them so they teach their children to behave,”
said Viktor Biryukov, a spokesman for the state police in
Moscow, by phone. Several of them were carrying knives, he said.
“Situation in the city is normal now, all is quiet.”  Thousands of fans of Moscow’s Spartak soccer club gathered
near Red Square on Dec. 11 to protest the Dec. 6 shooting death
of a Spartak fan during a fight with migrants from the North
Caucasus. Young men chanting racist slogans attacked police and
passersby at the rally,  footage  on Grani TV showed. Dozens of
people were hospitalized and 66 arrested for the attacks, which
Interior Minister  Rashid Nurgaliyev  blamed on nationalists.  “Radicals” from Central Asia and the Caucasus region were
planning to gather near Kievsky train station tonight to protest
the weekend attacks, while Russian nationalist groups are
meeting near Red Square, Biryukov said. The locations are about
3 kilometers (2 miles) apart, or three stops on the subway.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  ordered police to “clean up”
the streets after the incident and condemned “crimes aimed at
race, ethnicity or religion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
