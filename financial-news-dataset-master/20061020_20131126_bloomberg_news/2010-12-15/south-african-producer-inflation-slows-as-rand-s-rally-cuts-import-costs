The cost of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose an annual 6.2 percent in
November, higher than forecast, reducing expectations the
central bank will cut interest rates again next year.  Producer prices increased after gaining 6.4 percent in
October, Pretoria-based  Statistics South Africa  said on its
website today. The  median estimate  of 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 6 percent. Prices rose 0.7 percent in the month.  Oil prices have climbed 21 percent in New York since June
1, reaching as high as $88.31 a barrel today. While that has
been partly offset by the rand’s 12 percent rally against the
dollar in the same period, that’s not enough to prevent a pickup
in consumer-price inflation, reducing the likelihood of further
rate cuts.  “Interest rates are expected to remain unchanged
throughout next year as domestic growth remains subdued and
inflation, despite ticking up slightly, stays well-contained,”
said  Carmen Altenkirch , an economist at Nedbank Group Ltd. in
Johannesburg.  The rand was at 6.8138 against the dollar as of 4:40 p.m.
in Johannesburg, from 6.8439 before the data was released. The
yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, fell 1 basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.47 percent.  Consumer-price inflation accelerated for a second month in
November, reaching 3.6 percent from a year ago, the statistics
office said yesterday. With Inflation remaining within the
target band, Governor  Gill Marcus  has been able to cut the
repurchase rate three times this year to 5.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
