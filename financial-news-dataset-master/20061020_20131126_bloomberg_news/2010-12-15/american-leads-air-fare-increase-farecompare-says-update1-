American Airlines  raised domestic
fares as much as $10 round trip, sparking an industrywide
increase in ticket prices, according to travel website
FareCompare.com.  Pushing up base prices has been difficult because low-cost
carriers don’t always go along,  Rick Seaney , chief executive
officer of Dallas-based FareCompare, said today in a telephone
interview. Carriers “can’t afford to be a buck more” than
competitors, he said.  The Dec. 13 move by Fort Worth, Texas-based American was
matched by U.S. carriers including Continental Airlines,  Delta
Air Lines Inc. , United Airlines, US Airways Group Inc. and
Southwest Airlines Co., the largest discounter, FareCompare
said. The industrywide participation may make this rate hike one
of the few successful ones this year, Seaney said.  “I’ve never seen an airfare hike that Southwest joined
that didn’t stick,” he said. “It’s the bellwether.”  The struggle to raise domestic prices across the board has
led U.S. carriers to charge higher fees for high-demand periods
and sell fewer lower-cost seats, while keeping planes at their
fullest since World War II.  American parent AMR Corp. declined 17 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $7.56 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index fell 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
