Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips, said a
strengthening Taiwan dollar will hurt its profit margins.  Every 1 percent rise in the Taiwan dollar against the U.S.
currency would reduce its gross margin by 0.4 percentage point,
and the operating margin by 0.5 percentage point, Elizabeth Sun,
a spokeswoman for the chipmaker, said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
