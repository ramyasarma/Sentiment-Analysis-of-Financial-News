Southern California home sales fell
16 percent in November from a year earlier to the second-lowest
level for the month in three years as unemployment in the state
lingers above 12 percent, MDA DataQuick said.  A total of 16,208 homes sold in Los Angeles, Riverside, San
Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange counties, the San
Diego-based research company said today in a statement. November
sales last were lower in 2007, when 13,173 new and resale homes
sold. Last month’s sales were about 26 percent below the
November average.  “Fundamentally home sales remain weak because the job
market has been slow to mend and credit policies remain
unusually tight,”  John Walsh , president of MDA DataQuick, said
in the statement.  California’s seasonally adjusted  unemployment rate  was 12.4
percent in October, the latest month for which figures are
available. That’s close to the 12.6 percent record reached in
March, according to the state’s Employment Development
Department. The U.S. jobless rate was 9.8 percent in November.  Home sales in Southern California last month dropped 3.2
percent from October. Sales typically drop from from October to
November, with an average decline of 8.1 percent since 1988,
when MDA DataQuick’s statistics begin, the company said.  The median Southern California home price was $287,000 last
month, up 1.4 percent from October and 0.7 percent from a year
earlier. Last month, 21 percent of all sales were for $500,000
or more, little changed from October and up from less than 20
percent a year earlier, according to MDA DataQuick, a unit of
Richmond, British Columbia-based  MacDonald Dettwiler &
Associates Ltd.   To contact the reporters on this story:
