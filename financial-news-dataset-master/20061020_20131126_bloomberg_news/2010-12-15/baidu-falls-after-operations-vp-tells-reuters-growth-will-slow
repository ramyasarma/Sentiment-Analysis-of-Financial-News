Baidu Inc.  tumbled the most in five
months in U.S. trading after Reuters reported that  Haoyu Shen ,
vice president of business operations, said he expects growth
will slow next year.  The operator of China’s biggest Internet search engine fell
6 percent, the biggest plunge since June 29, to $100.20 at 4
p.m. New York time.  “We had a major re-acceleration this year, and that’s due
to a few reasons,” Shen said at the Reuters China Investment
Summit, citing China’s economic growth, the introduction of
keyword-based advertising system Phoenix Nest and a retreat by
Google Inc., Reuters reported. “For these reasons, it most
likely won’t repeat itself next year.”  Phone calls to Baidu’s offices in Beijing weren’t answered.  Baidu’s share of China’s Internet search-engine market
increased to 73 percent in the third quarter from 71 percent,
while Google Inc.’s market share dropped to 25 percent from 27
percent, according to iResearch, a Shanghai-based company that
studies internet traffic.  Baidu’s shares have soared 144 percent this year, beating
online rivals in China including  Tencent Holdings Ltd. , the
country’s biggest Internet company by market value, and
 Alibaba.com Ltd. , the leading local e-commerce operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
