The Swiss franc jumped to a record
versus the euro after Moody’s Investors Service said it may
downgrade Spain’s credit rating, stoking demand for
Switzerland’s currency as a haven.  The franc strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.2789 per euro at
10:21 a.m. in London. It earlier reached 1.2759, surpassing the
previous record of 1.2766 set on Sept. 8.  Switzerland’s franc has benefited as Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis worsened, surging 16 percent against the single
currency this year. The euro fell against 11 of its 16 major
counterparts today as Moody’s said costs to rebuild Spanish
banks and debts from regional governments may put the nation’s
credit rating at risk.  “The Swiss franc is deemed as a safe haven,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank in London. “The euro is suffering across the board against
major currencies, and this has really been refreshed in
investors’ minds following the Moody’s headlines this morning on
Spain..”  To contact the reporters on this story:
