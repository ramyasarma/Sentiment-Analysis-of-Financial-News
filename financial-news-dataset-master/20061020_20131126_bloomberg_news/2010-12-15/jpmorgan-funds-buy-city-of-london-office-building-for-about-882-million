Two funds run by  J.P. Morgan Asset
Management  acquired the London headquarters of law firm  Allen &
Overy LLP  for about 560 million pounds ($882 million).  The 71,900 square-meter (773,925 square-foot) building at
Bishops Square, adjacent to Spitalfields Market in the City of
London financial district, was sold by Oman’s sovereign wealth
fund and  Hammerson Plc , according to a statement today.  Rents are rising in London because of a scarcity of large
new office buildings. The financial crisis made banks unwilling
to lend to developers, causing construction in central London to
fall to its lowest in more than 20 years, according to real
estate broker Drivers Jonas Deloitte. It predicts that rents in
the City rose by 25 percent this year.  “We remain bullish on investing in high-quality, well-
tenanted office properties located throughout Europe’s most
important cities,” said  Peter Reilly , head of JPMorgan’s real
estate asset management arm.  Hammerson developed the building in 2005 and sold a 75
percent stake in the property to Oman Investment Fund in June
2009. It expects to book a profit of 79 million pounds for the
sale of its remaining 25 percent stake, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
