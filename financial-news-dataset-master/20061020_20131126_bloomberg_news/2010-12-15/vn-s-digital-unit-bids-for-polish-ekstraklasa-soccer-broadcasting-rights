The N digital television unit of TVN
SA, Poland’s only publicly traded network, is bidding for the
rights to broadcast the games of Ekstraklasa, the country’s top
soccer division.  The three-year deal will cost more than the current
arrangement, partly because new stadiums are increasing interest
in the sport, TVN Chief Executive Officer Markus Tellenbach told
reporters in Warsaw today.  Vivendi SA’s Canal Plus unit paid 360 million zloty ($120
million) for the rights three years ago, Ekstraklasa spokesman
Adrian Skubis said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
