Diet-supplement makers may face
criminal charges if they sell “deceptively labeled” products
that contain steroids or ingredients found in obesity or
erectile-dysfunction drugs, U.S. regulators said.  Weight-loss, body-building and sexual-enhancement products
are the most common types of illegal supplements, the Food and
Drug Administration said today in a statement. Diet-supplement
makers and their workers may be investigated for marketing the
substances and face felony charges, the FDA said in a  letter  to
manufacturers.  The FDA has worked with the supplement industry to recall
more than 80 products marketed for body building, 70 for sexual
enhancement, and 40 for weight loss, the agency said in its
letter. Some weight-loss supplements contained the active
ingredient in  Abbott Laboratories ’ diet drug Meridia, which was
pulled off the market in October because of heart risks.  “We want consumers to be aware that there are products
masquerading as dietary supplements that pose significant
dangers,”  Joshua Sharfstein , the FDA’s principal deputy
commissioner, said today on a conference call. “These products
are generally poorly labeled, so the consumer doesn’t know what
he or she is really buying.” The FDA has warned consumers about
almost 300 such products since 2007, he said.  Some illegal sexual-enhancement products contain
sildenafil, the active ingredient in  Pfizer Inc.’s  erectile-
dysfunction drug Viagra and  Eli Lilly & Co.’s  Cialis, the FDA
said.  Sildenafil Warnings  The agency said last month that it was investigating the
death of a 26-year-old man that may have been linked to Piston
Corp.’s  Vigor-25 , a sexual-enhancement product that contains
sildenafil. The FDA warned consumers Dec. 10 not to use Synergy
Distribution LLC’s Man Up Now capsules, which contain a
variation of sildenafil. The drug can cause dangerous drops in
blood pressure, and can interact with prescription drugs such as
nitroglycerin, the FDA said.  Slimming Beauty, a weight-loss supplement sold online by
Beautiful Health Inc., is among illegal weight-loss products
that contain the stimulant sibutramine, the active ingredient in
Meridia, the FDA said in today’s statement.  “These tainted products can cause serious adverse effects,
including strokes, organ failure, and death,” FDA Commissioner
 Margaret Hamburg  said in the statement. “The manufacturers
selling these tainted products are operating outside the law.”  Anonymous Reporting  The FDA is creating a web feed to alert consumers more
quickly when it discovers tainted supplements, Sharfstein said.
The agency also is setting up a new e-mail address,
 taintedproducts@fda.hhs.gov , to let people anonymously notify
the FDA of supplements they suspect are illegal.  Five trade associations endorsed the FDA’s move, saying in
a joint statement that products with undeclared drug ingredients
or steroids tarnish the reputation of the legitimate supplement
industry.  “We have been astonished at the unfortunate growth of this
particular class of products, which are intentionally spiked,”
 Loren Israelsen , executive director of the  United Natural
Products Alliance  in Salt Lake City, said on the FDA’s
conference call. “These are illegal acts committed by people
who work in the shadows. They are very difficult to find. We are
committed to joining FDA to find them and to drive them out of
the industry.”  The  Consumer Healthcare Products Association , the  Council
for Responsible Nutrition  and the  Natural Products Association ,
all based in Washington, and the Silver Spring, Maryland-based
 American Herbal Products Association  also participated in
today’s FDA announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
