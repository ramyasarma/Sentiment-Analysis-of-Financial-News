Portugal’s borrowing costs rose at a
sale of 500 million euros ($666 million) of 3-month bills today
as Moody’s Investors Service put neighboring Spain’s debt rating
on review, increasing pressure on peripheral euro-area nations.  The securities due March 18 were issued today at an average
yield of 3.403 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with an average yield of 1.818 percent at a
previous sale of 3-month bills on Nov. 3. The auction attracted
bids for 1.9 times the amount offered, down from the bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.2 in November. The amount raised matched the
agency’s indicative target of 500 million euros for the auction.  “The yield was a little bit lower than I feared, but it
doesn’t change the overall picture,”  David Schnautz , a fixed-
income strategist at Commerzbank AG, said by phone. “There is
no place for Portugal to hide on the curve. The level of stress
is tremendous.”  The yield on Portugal’s 10-year bonds rose for an eighth
day, climbing 8 points to 6.64 percent after the auction. The
spread with German bunds increased to 342, Bloomberg generic
prices show.  Moody’s today said it may downgrade Spain amid concern it
may follow Greece and Ireland in seeking a bailout. Standard &
Poor’s warned last month it may cut Portugal’s credit rating as
contagion from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis spreads.  To contact the reporter on this story:
