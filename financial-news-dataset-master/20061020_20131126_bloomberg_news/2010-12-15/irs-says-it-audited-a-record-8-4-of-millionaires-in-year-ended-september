The U.S. Internal Revenue Service
 audited 8.36 percent  of Americans reporting more than $1 million
of income in fiscal 2010, the highest rate in the agency’s
recorded history.  The agency said today it conducted face-to-face audits of
16,509 millionaires and mail audits of 15,985 millionaires in
the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That’s an increase of
almost 2 percentage points from a year earlier.  Overall, the IRS audit rate for individual returns reached
1.11 percent in fiscal 2010, the highest level in 10 years. U.S.
taxpayers with incomes of less than $200,000 had an audit rate
of 1.04 percent. The agency audited 3.1 percent of returns from
taxpayers with annual incomes exceeding $200,000.  The IRS began separately tracking its audit rate for
taxpayer returns with $1 million or more in fiscal year 2004.
The examination rate for that income group in that year was 5.03
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
