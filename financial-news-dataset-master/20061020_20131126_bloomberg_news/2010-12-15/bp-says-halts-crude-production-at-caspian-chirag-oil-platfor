BP Plc  said it halted production at
the Chirag oil platform in the Caspian Sea on Dec. 11 for
unscheduled repair work.  The platform normally produces about 91,000 barrels of oil
a day,  Robert Wine , a company spokesman, said by telephone from
London today, adding that there was no set date yet for its
restart. The disruption will affect flows through BP’s Western
Export Route Pipeline to the Black Sea port of Supsa in Georgia,
he said.  A fault was detected during routine testing of the
platform’s so-called fire-water system, Wine said.  The Azeri-Chiraq-Guneshli fields located 100 kilometers (62
miles) east of Baku constitute the largest field under
development in Azerbaijan’s sector of the Caspian basin,
according to BP’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
