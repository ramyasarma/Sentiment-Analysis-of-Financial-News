Japanese companies  are so
pessimistic that even the biggest cash piles since 2001 and
borrowing costs near five-year lows can’t spur them to invest.  Cash and equivalents  at members of the benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average climbed 8 percent to 1,309 yen ($15.60) a
share this year, the most since Bloomberg began collecting the
data. Companies cut bond sales 17 percent to 9.5 trillion yen
this year from last year’s record 11.4 trillion yen even as the
Bank of Japan reduced interest rates to near zero and average
corporate yields dropped for a second year, reaching 0.67
percent in October, the least since July 2005, the data show.  “We have more cash than we need, but no growth
investments,”  Kazuto Tsubouchi , chief financial officer at NTT
DoCoMo Inc., said in an interview last month. Japan’s largest
mobile-phone operator reported 529.7 billion yen in cash as of
Sept. 30. “This is a great time to issue bonds, and we would
if we had no money,” Tsubouchi said.  Bank lending shrank 2.1 percent in November, the 12th
monthly decline, as companies avoided borrowing, the BOJ
reported Dec. 8. Business confidence slumped for the first time
in seven quarters, the BOJ’s Tankan report yesterday showed,
even as the central bank expanded purchases of government bonds,
corporate debt and equities to 35 trillion yen to pump money
into the financial system.  The median ratio of cash to total assets for companies in
the Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to 7 percent, according to
the latest company filings, from 6.44 percent a year earlier.
For companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the ratio
fell to 6.81 percent from 7.22 percent.  Shrinking Economy  The economy will shrink 1.9 percent this quarter as Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan ’s stimulus spending fades, the government-
affiliated Economic Planning Association said last week, citing
forecasts from economists. The world’s second-largest economy
is struggling to end deflation, an extended decline in prices
that deters investment by crimping sales revenue and profit
margins while encouraging companies to put off spending to
benefit from lower costs in the future.  The difference between yields on five-year Japanese
government notes and inflation-linked debt expanded one basis
point yesterday to minus 0.70 percent, an indication of the
annual average drop in prices investors expect over the coming
five years.  ‘Missing Out’  “Japanese companies are missing out on investment
opportunities offered by the current market environment because
of entrenched risk aversion,” said  Yoshihiro Nakatani , a
senior fund manager at Asahi Life Asset Management, which has
$8.5 billion of assets under management. “It’s not clear how
long these conditions will continue, so the time may come when
they will regret not borrowing now.”  NTT DoCoMo  said it may pay off 158 billion yen of bonds as
they mature by March 31, slashing outstanding debt 28 percent.  The company’s  cash  exceeded 500 billion yen during the
first half of Japan’s fiscal year for each of the past three
years, climbing from 317.5 billion yen in the six months ended
September 2007, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .
DoCoMo’s cash holdings were the eighth-largest among technology
companies in the  Nikkei 225 . Panasonic Corp. tops the list at
1.87 trillion yen.  Yields Dropping  Yields have dropped on DoCoMo bonds coming due as the
company’s cash pile expanded, with the yield on its 115 billion
yen of 1.43 percent 10-year bonds falling to 0.147 percent,
from a high of 1.678 percent in February 2002, according to the
data. The cost to protect DoCoMo bonds against default for five
years through credit-default swaps has fallen to 28.40 basis
points from as high as 97 in March 2008, according to CMAN.
That compares with 70.56 for five-year JGBs.  Five-year credit-default swaps on 50 Japanese investment-
grade borrowers bonds have dropped 38 basis points since June
30 to 100.5 basis points on Dec. 14, CMA prices in New York
show. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to debt agreements.  Corporations are hoarding cash worldwide after the credit
crunch that started in 2007 sparked the first global recession
since the end of World War II. Members of the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index have raised their holdings 10 percent this year to
$261.68 a share, the most since Bloomberg started compiling the
data in 1998.  Corporate Cash Pile  At the equivalent of $870 billion, Japan’s corporate cash
pile is the second-largest among developed Asian markets,
lagging behind the $1 trillion set aside by companies in Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index, according to the data.  Efforts by Japanese companies to reduce debt may make them
readier to return to bond markets for financing as global
growth strengthens.  “The monetary easing by the Bank of Japan is making the
bond market unbelievably strong,” said  Akihito Murata , a
Tokyo-based analyst Deutsche Bank AG’s. The spread between
yields on corporate and government bonds is the lowest since
mid-2005, Murata said. Yields on corporate bonds in an index
compiled by Nomura Securities Co. are six basis points higher
than those on the company’s index of government bonds, down
from a high of 75 in February 2009.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
estimating Japan’s public debt will expand next year to more
than 200 percent of the economy.  Treasuries Decline  Investors in Japanese corporate bonds lost 0.9 percent
since Sept. 30, less than the 2 percent drop for government
notes, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. U.S. company debt lost 2.1 percent as of Dec. 13, while
 Treasuries  slid 2.7 percent, the indexes show.  Japanese government  bonds  are heading toward the biggest
quarterly drop since June 2008. The yield on the 1.2 percent
10-year bond due December 2020 rose as high as 1.295 percent
yesterday from 0.93 percent on Sept. 30.  The yen’s 11 percent gain against the dollar this year
lowers the cost of overseas investments.  Nippon Telegraph &
Telephone Corp. ,  Astellas Pharma Inc.  and  Sumitomo Corp.  this
year announced Japan’s three biggest overseas acquisitions,
paying as much as $7.8 billion in cash combined.  The yen climbed to 80.22 against the dollar on Nov. 1, the
highest level since April 1995, and traded at 83.82 at 3:17 p.m.
in Tokyo yesterday.  Cross-Border M&A  Investments by Japanese companies overseas rose to $27.1
billion this year, from $22.9 billion in 2009, according to
Bloomberg data. They spent $73.8 billion on overseas
acquisitions in 2008.  Until this year, NTT shied away from overseas purchases
after DoCoMo, its wireless unit, wrote off 1.5 trillion yen
from 2000 to 2004 on investments in companies including AT&T
Wireless Services Inc. Those losses served as a “valuable
lesson,” Tsubouchi said.  The phone company, which owns 63 percent of DoCoMo, in
July agreed to buy South Africa’s Dimension Data Plc. for 2.1
billion pounds ($3.3 billion). The acquisition was NTT’s
biggest since 2000 and Japan’s second-largest bid for an
overseas asset this year.  “We have a wealth of options, but we will exercise
caution,” NTT DoCoMo CFO Tsubouchi said. “The troubling
prospect is that money may flood into investment areas that
only appear to offer growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
