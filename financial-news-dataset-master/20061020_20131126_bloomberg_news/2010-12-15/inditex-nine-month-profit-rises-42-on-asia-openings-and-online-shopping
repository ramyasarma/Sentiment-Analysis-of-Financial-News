Inditex SA , the world’s largest
clothing retailer, said nine-month profit increased 42 percent,
as it sold more clothing in Asia and introduced online shopping.  Net income in the nine months ended Oct. 31 rose to 1.179
billion euros ($1.57 billion) from 831 million euros a year
earlier, the Arteixo, Spain-based company said in a statement
today. The average  estimate  of 12 analysts was 1.17 billion
euros based on Bloomberg calculations.  The owner of the Zara and Massimo Dutti chains has
accelerated store openings in Asia to reduce reliance on Spain,
where about 30 percent of its outlets are located. Massimo Dutti
opened its first locations in South Korea this month, taking the
number of Inditex stores in the country to 27. Zara started
online sales in September.  Gross profit as a proportion of sales increased to 59.9
percent from 57.1 percent a year earlier.  Inditex is better placed to face import price inflation
because it’s less dependent on Asia for merchandise purchasing
than competitors including Hennes & Mauritz AB,  Luca Solca , an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, wrote in a Dec. 10
note. He has an “outperform” rating on both retailers.  Nine-month revenue rose 14 percent to 8.87 billion euros
after the retailer added 300 stores worldwide, bringing the
total to 4,907 in 77 countries. In-store sales in local
currencies climbed 10 percent in the period between Aug. 1 and
Dec. 12.  Inditex  shares have gained 44 percent in Madrid this year,
while H&M has advanced 23 percent and  Gap Inc.  has fallen less
than 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
