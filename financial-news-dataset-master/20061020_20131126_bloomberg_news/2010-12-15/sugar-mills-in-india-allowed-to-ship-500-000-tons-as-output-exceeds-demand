India, the world’s second-biggest
sugar producer, plans to review its export policy in January
amid projections that output will top domestic demand for the
first time in three years.  The government approved shipments of 500,000 metric tons
for the year to Sept. 30, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  told
reporters in New Delhi yesterday. Procedures for sales outside
the country will be completed in 10 days and a review of export
plans will take place at the end of next month, Pawar said.  Rising supplies may help cool sugar prices that reached the
highest level in almost 30 years last month in New York on
concern that shipments from Brazil, the biggest producer, and
India, may be too low to meet demand. Sales from India have been
regulated after drought in 2009 damaged cane crops.  “We hope that more is allowed,”  Vivek Saraogi , managing
director of  Balrampur Chini Ltd. , India’s second-biggest mill,
and the president of the Indian Sugar Mills Association, or
ISMA, said in an interview. “Exports will help our cash flows
and our ability to make payments to cane farmers.”  Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd. , the biggest sugar producer, and
rivals gained in Mumbai today. Bajaj advanced 2.3 percent to
110.45 rupees, while Balrampur, the second biggest, surged 2.4
percent to 79.75 rupees at close, the highest level since Dec.
6.  Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. , the nation’s biggest refiner,
jumped 5 percent to 89.7 rupees.  Potential Exports  The country may be able to export at least 2 million tons
under the so-called open general-license plan and a further 1.4
million tons lying at ports and against earlier permits, Saraogi
said Nov. 10, matching a forecast by the National Federation of
Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.  “The market expects India to increase the export limit,”
said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group Inc.
in Chicago. “We shall wait to hear how much the extent of
increase will be next month.”  Raw-sugar for March fell as much as 0.6 percent to 30.94
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York today, while white
sugar for March delivery gained as much as 0.4 percent to
$770.80 a ton in London.  India’s production may total 24.5 million tons, exceeding
demand of 23 million tons, the government said last month. ISMA
and the National Federation forecast 25.5 million tons. Output
may be 23.27 million tons, according to data from farmers
interviewed by SGS SA for Bloomberg News.  Production was 26.4 million tons in 2007-2008, the last
time that output surpassed consumption, data from ISMA show.  ‘Quicker the Shipments’  “India can ship 500,000 tons in two to three months but it
will depend on the modalities that are finalized,” said  Yatin Wadhwana , managing director of Sucden India Pvt. “The simpler
the modalities, the quicker the shipments will be.”  Sucden expects production of 25.8 million tons and exports
of about 2 million to 3 million tons this marketing year,
Wadhwana said last month.  The government will pay 18.47 rupees (41 cents) a kilogram
to mills for supplying sugar to the government this year for
onward sale to the poor, 5 percent more than the 17.57 rupees
last year, Pawar said.  India’s sugar mills are required to sell 10 percent of
their production at below-market prices to the government for
resale to the poor under the so-called levy quota. Mills can
sell their remaining output at market rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
