             Argentine dollar warrants linked to
economic growth climbed for the first time in four days after
the government reported that tax revenue in June rose 39 percent
on the year.  
 The dollar-denominated warrants rose 0.22 cent to 7.9 cents
on the dollar at 4:15 p.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg
pricing.  
 “The warrants are rising amid the recent economic forecast
revisions, and higher tax revenue reflect that growth,” said
 Noelia Lucini , a portfolio manager with Capital Markets
Argentina in Buenos Aires.  
 Argentina’s tax agency, Afip, reported last night that June
revenue rose to 37.3 billion pesos ($9.48 billion).  
 RBS Securities Inc. this week lifted its forecast for
Argentine economic growth this year to 7 percent from 4.4
percent, citing the likelihood that President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  will fuel consumption ahead of elections next year.  
 The annual payment on the GDP warrants, which were
distributed in 2005 to win approval for a debt restructuring, is
triggered when economic growth is above 3 percent and the
inflation-adjusted value of the country’s GDP is above the
government’s base-case scenario laid out in the warrants.  
 Holders of the warrants will receive no payment this year
because the government said the economy expanded 0.9 percent in
2009, less than the growth threshold that triggers payments on
the securities. Argentina made a warrant payment of $3.11 on the
dollar on Dec. 15 after the economy grew 6.8 percent in 2008.  
 Argentina’s national statistics agency Indec reported last
week that the economy expanded 9.7 percent on an annual basis
during April, surpassing the median estimate of 7.1 percent
growth in a Bloomberg survey of seven economists.  
 The peso was little changed at 3.9333 per dollar from
3.9323 yesterday. The currency dropped 0.1 percent this week.
