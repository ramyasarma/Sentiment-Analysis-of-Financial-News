             Barton Biggs , the hedge-fund manager,
said he’s worried the U.S. may enter a recession for the second
time in three years and has reduced the risk of his investments
as a result.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may decline 10 percent to
15 percent if there’s another recession, Biggs said during an
interview with Bloomberg Television.
