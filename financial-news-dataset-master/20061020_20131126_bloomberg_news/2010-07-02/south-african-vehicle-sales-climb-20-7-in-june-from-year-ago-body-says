             South African vehicle sales climbed
an annual 20.7 percent in June after the central bank cut
interest rates for a seventh time and economic growth
accelerated, an industry group said.  
 Vehicle sales  rose to 39,931 last month, the Pretoria-based
 National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa 
said in an e-mailed statement today. The figures include sales
from carmakers that aren’t members of the association.  
 The  Reserve Bank  cut its benchmark interest  rate  by half a
percentage point to 6.5 percent on March 25, the seventh
reduction since December 2008, to lift consumer spending.
Africa’s biggest economy expanded an annualized 4.6 percent in
the first quarter, as rising global demand lifted manufacturing
and mining output.  
 “The 5.5 percentage decline in interest rates since the
end of 2008, an improvement in loan finance approval rates, as
well as pent up replacement demand, has continued to contribute
to the recovery in domestic sales,” the association said.  
 Vehicle exports surged 73.6 percent to 20,434 in June from
a year ago, the association said.  
 Toyota Motor Corp., South Africa’s biggest carmaker, sold
8,224 vehicles in the local market last month, followed by
Volkswagen AG with 6,185 in sales and General Motors Corp. with
3,824, the association said.
