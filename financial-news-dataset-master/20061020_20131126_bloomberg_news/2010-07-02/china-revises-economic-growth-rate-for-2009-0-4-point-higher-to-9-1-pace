             China, the world’s third-largest
economy, raised its estimate for growth in 2009 to 9.1 percent
from 8.7 percent, as output by industrial and services companies
increased at a faster pace.  
 The  expansion  put the value of gross domestic product at
34.05 trillion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a
statement on its website today. The figure translates to $4.98
trillion based on the average exchange rate between the yuan and
the dollar in 2009, suggesting Japan retained its position as
the second-largest economy with economic output of $5.07
trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Growth was revised after “verification” of preliminary
data released on Jan. 21 showed expansion in both the industry
and services sectors was 0.4 percentage point faster than
originally estimated, according to today’s  statement .  
 “China usually revises economic growth due to insufficient
data collection, especially in the services sector,” said  Lu Ting , a Hong Kong-based economist at Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch. “The revision to the industrial sector may be due to
volatility in prices last year stemming from the financial
crisis.”  
 The pace of industrial expansion was raised to 9.9 percent
and the rate for services was increased to 9.3 percent, the
statistics bureau said.  
 Census Revisions  
 Liao Qun , a Hong Kong-based economist at Citic Bank
International Ltd., today reduced his forecast for China’s
growth this year to 10.1 percent from 10.3 percent due to
uncertainties in the property sector and the European debt
crisis. He also cited a higher comparative base after today’s
revision by the statistics bureau.  
 China in December revised the 2008 growth rate to 9.6
percent from 9 percent after an economic census last year found
more output from services companies.  
 The census also prompted revisions to 2005, 2006 and 2007
growth rates earlier this year. The original and revised growth
rates are given below.
