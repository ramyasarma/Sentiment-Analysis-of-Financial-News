             German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
that the European Union’s 750 billion-euro ($945 billion) rescue
package for the euro is only buying time for governments to cut
budget deficits.  
 “A policy of saving, scaling back deficits that have risen
very sharply -- that’s the task we have to accomplish now,”
Merkel said in an interview with RTL television today in Berlin,
citing the call for cutting deficits endorsed by her and other
Group of 20 leaders at their meeting in Toronto last week.  
 “This work has to be done by all countries over several
years, coupled with structural reforms, so we can say in the end
that the euro is stable and sustainably secured,” even when
“rescue umbrellas” aren’t in place, Merkel said.  
 Germany will push for a Europe-wide tax on financial
transactions after the G-20 rebuffed her call for a global
approach, Merkel said. “We’ll have to discuss this.”  
 Asked whether such a tax might hurt the competitiveness of
European financial companies, Merkel said it can be done in “a
balanced way.”
