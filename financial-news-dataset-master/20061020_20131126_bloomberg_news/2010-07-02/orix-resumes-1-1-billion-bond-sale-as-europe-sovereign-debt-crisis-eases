             Orix Corp. , the Japanese financial-
services company, will issue 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion) of
bonds as concern over Europe’s sovereign debt crisis eases after
delaying a sale initially planned for May.  
 Orix priced 10 billion yen of three-year, 1.26 percent
bonds for institutional buyers to yield 72 basis points more
than the yen swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Tokyo-based company will pay the same spread on 90 billion
yen of similar-maturity 1.26 percent bonds offered to individual
investors, the data show.  
 “The market was roiled in May due to Europe’s problems,”
Orix spokesman Atsushi Horii said in a telephone interview.
“Now it has recovered.”  
 Orix, Hanwa Co., Kajima Corp. and Sapporo Holdings Inc.
postponed bond sales in May as borrowing costs climbed on
Europe’s debt woes. The extra yield investors demand to own
bonds issued by Japanese financial services companies instead of
government debt declined to 142 basis points yesterday from as
much as 158 basis points on June 10, the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Japan Financial Services index shows. Spreads averaged 109
basis points on May 5, the index shows.  
 Orix has more than halved its borrowing costs in four
months. It priced three-year, 2.44 percent bonds to pay a 185
basis-point spread on Feb. 24, Bloomberg data show. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Money raised from the new bonds will be used to repay
maturing debt, according to a filing today with Japan’s finance
ministry. Orix will sell the bonds to individuals between July 5
and July 15, according to an e-mailed statement from Mizuho
Securities Co.
