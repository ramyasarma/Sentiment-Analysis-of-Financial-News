             Switzerland’s benchmark  Swiss Market
Index  declined 7.36, or 0.1 percent, to 5,974.3, extending this
week’s drop to 4.8 percent.  
 The following were among the most active stocks in the
Swiss market today. Symbols are in parentheses.  
 Evolva AG  (EVE SW) jumped 16 percent to 2.13 Swiss francs
after the drugmaker said it will receive an additional 3.5
million francs ($3.3 million) from two investors.  
 Kardex AG  (KARN SW) fell 9.6 percent to 29.7 francs after
the supplier of automated storage systems said first half-sales
will be around 15 percent lower than last year. The company also
sees a “negative” operating profit and a net loss.  
 Nestle SA  (NESN VX) slid 1.7 percent to 50.35 francs, a
fourth day of losses. Morgan Stanley reduced its rating on the
world’s biggest food company to “equal weight” from
“overweight,” saying “further earnings upgrades are unlikely
and consensus now reflects many of the positive attributes
investors have come to rely on.”  
 SGS SA  (SGSN VX) gained 1.7 percent to 1,461 francs after
CA Cheuvreux raised its price estimate on the world’s biggest
goods inspector. The brokerage said the company’s first-half
