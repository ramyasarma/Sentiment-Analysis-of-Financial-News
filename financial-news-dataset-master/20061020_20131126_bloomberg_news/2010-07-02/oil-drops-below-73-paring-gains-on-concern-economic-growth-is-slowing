             Crude oil traded near $73 a barrel,
after slipping 6.8 percent in the previous four days, on concern
that slowing economic growth in the U.S. and China will limit
fuel demand.  
 Oil erased gains made earlier today when investors
purchased futures on perceptions the market fell too far, too
fast. The U.S. may have shed 130,000 jobs in June, according to
a Bloomberg survey of economists ahead of a government report on
non-farm payrolls today. China and American yesterday reported
slowing manufacturing expansions.  
 “Pretty much everyone is waiting for the non-farm
payrolls,” said  Clarence Chu , a trader at options dealer Hudson
Capital Energy in Singapore. “Everyone is expecting a pullback.
The big picture is bearish. Yesterday all the macro numbers were
down.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery was at $73.18 a barrel, up 23
cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:14 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract earlier rose as much as 43 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $73.38 a barrel. It fell $2.68 yesterday to
$72.95, the lowest settlement price since June 8.  
 The market’s four-day drop through yesterday was the
longest pullback since May 18. Oil is poised for a decline of
7.2 percent for the week, the biggest slump since the week ended
May 7. Futures lost 9.7 percent in the three months ended June
30, the first quarterly decline since 2008.  
 Crude also declined as Asian stocks fell after Goldman
Sachs released a report saying Chinese economic growth will drop
to “8 percent or below” in the second half of the year.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  was down 0.4 percent to 111.59
as of 2:53 p.m. Singapore time. The measure has fallen 3.6
percent this week, the most since the period ended May 21.  
 Brent crude for August was at $72.50 a barrel, up 16 at
3:07 p.m. Singapore time on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The contract earlier rose as much as 49 cents, or 0.7
percent to $72.83. Yesterday, it slipped $2.67, or 3.6 percent,
to end the session at $72.34, also was the lowest settlement
since June 8.  
 Crude oil may fall next week as data on manufacturing,
jobless claims and home sales bolster concern the U.S. economic
recovery is faltering, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Twenty of 38 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through July 9. Ten respondents, or 26 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and eight saw an
increase. Last week an equal number of analysts forecast a gain
or drop.
