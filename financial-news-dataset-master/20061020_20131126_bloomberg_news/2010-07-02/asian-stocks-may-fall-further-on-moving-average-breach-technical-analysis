             The  MSCI Asia Excluding Japan Index 
may decline toward the 420-point level as the gauge fell below
its 200-day moving average, adding to signs the slump will
continue, according to CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.  
 That level is about 8 percent lower than yesterday’s close
of 457.58. The attached chart shows the gauge fell below the
200-day moving average, which then stood at 471.6, on June 29 as
stocks tumbled on concern the pace of China’s recovery was
faltering. The measure last traded below that line on May 18, a
week before the index dropped to its lowest close this year of
425.52.  
 There’s been a number of bearish signals for the market in
recent weeks, the latest of which is the gauge’s drop below the
200-day moving average, according to  Nigel Foo , Kuala Lumpur-
based regional technical analyst at CIMB. On June 18, the 50-day
moving average also fell through the 200-day moving average,
forming a “dead-cross” pattern considered bearish by analysts,
he said.  
 “These are signs of medium-term consolidation for the
Asian markets,” Foo said in a phone interview. “It’s quite
negative.”  
 The  MSCI Asia Excluding Japan Index  is likely to find
support at 420, near the May low, and could fall to between 340
and 360 points if that initial level is broken, he said.  
 The MSCI Asian gauge has fallen about 10 percent from its
highest this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis
and China’s moves to curb property prices will hurt global
growth.  
 Technical analysts, who base their predictions on price and
volume chart patterns, consider it a bullish signal if
securities stay above the 200-day moving average.
