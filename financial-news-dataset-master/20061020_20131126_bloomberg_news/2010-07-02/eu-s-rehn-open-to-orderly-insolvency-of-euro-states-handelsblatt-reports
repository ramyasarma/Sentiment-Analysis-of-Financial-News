             European Union Economic and Monetary 
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn doesn’t rule out the possibility
of introducing changes that would allow for an orderly 
insolvency of a euro-zone member, Handelsblatt reported in an 
interview.  
 For now though, Rehn is concentrating on reforms that don’t
require amendments to the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, the German 
newspaper cited him as saying. The commissioner isn’t against 
calls by Germany for tougher action on countries who break the 
budget rules of monetary union, according to Handelsblatt.  
 Croatia’s aim to become an EU member in 2012 would present 
an opportunity to amend the treaty, the newspaper cited Rehn as
saying.
