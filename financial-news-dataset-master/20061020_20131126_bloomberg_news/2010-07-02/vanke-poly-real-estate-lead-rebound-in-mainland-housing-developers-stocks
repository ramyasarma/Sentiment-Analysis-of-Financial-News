             China Vanke Co. and Poly Real Estate
Group Co. led the country’s property developers higher on
speculation recent declines were excessive relative to profit
prospects.  
 Vanke, the nation’s largest publicly traded developer,
gained 4 percent to 6.95 yuan as of 2:43 p.m. in Shenzhen
trading, snapping a five-day losing streak. Poly Real Estate
added 3.8 percent to 10.50 yuan.  
 A measure of property stocks on the Shanghai Composite
Index gained 3.4 percent today, the biggest advance among the
five industry groups.  
 The real-estate gauge is down 30 percent this year as the
government implemented policies to restrict property purchases
to curb record gains in housing prices.
