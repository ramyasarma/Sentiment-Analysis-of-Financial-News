             Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd. , an Indian
sponge-iron maker, rose to the highest in more than 21 months
after  Blackstone Group LP  agreed to invest 2.75 billion rupees
($59 million) to buy a 12.5 percent stake in its power unit.  
 Monnet Ispat  rose  16.3 percent to 468.45 rupees, the
highest level since September 2008, in Mumbai trading today
compared with a 0.3 percent decline in the benchmark  Sensitive
Index .  
 “They have significant plans in the power business, with
initial capacity addition of 1,000 megawatts,” said  Prasad Baji ,
a Mumbai-based analyst at Edelweiss Capital Ltd. “With the
equity funding coming in now, most of the pieces are falling in
place.”  
 Monnet Power Co. is building a 1,050 megawatt coal-based
power plant backed by pit-head mines in the eastern Indian state
of Orissa, Blackstone said in a statement yesterday. It is
setting up an additional 2,000 megawatts of generation capacity.  
 Monnet Ispat may list its power unit in two years,  Sandeep Jajodia , managing director, said by telephone from Mumbai today.
The company has applied to the government for setting up a 100-
megawatt solar power project, Jajodia said.  
 Demand for power is expected to rise in India as Asia’s
third-largest economy is poised to expand 8.5 percent in the
year ending March 2011. Electricity generation in India was 13.3
percent less than peak demand in the year ended March, according
to the Central Electricity Authority’s website.  
 Blackstone  shares  fell 1 percent to $9.47 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday.
