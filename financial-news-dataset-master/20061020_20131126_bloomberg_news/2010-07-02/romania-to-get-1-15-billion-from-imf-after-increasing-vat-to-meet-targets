             The International Monetary Fund
agreed to disburse about $1.15 billion to Romania, which last
week increased its sales tax to help meet deficit targets
attached to a loan approved 14 months ago.  
 Authorities “are taking ambitious adjustment measures to
contain the weakening of the fiscal position and set the stage
for a sustained improvement in public finances,” IMF First
Managing Director  John Lipsky  said in an e-mailed statement.
“Balancing the fiscal adjustment between expenditure cuts and
tax increases will help cushion its social impact, while at the
same time reversing excessive past increases in public wages.”  
 The Washington-based IMF had postponed the meeting on
Romania after its constitutional court rejected the government’s
plan to cut pensions by 15 percent. Romanian authorities decided
to raise the value-added tax to meet the 2010 budget deficit.  
 The government , relying on 20 billion euros ($25 billion)
in loans from the IMF and the European Union to finance its
deficit, raised the VAT to 24 percent on June 26. While
rejecting the pension cuts, the court on June 25 upheld a 25
percent reduction in wages for public workers.  
 Earlier today, the leu strengthened as much as 1.2 percent
to 4.2891 per euro, the most since May 2009, and traded 1.1
percent higher at 4.2937 at 6:13 p.m. in Bucharest, the largest
rally among more than 170 global currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  
 Recession  
 Romania’s economy, mired in the worst recession in two
decades, will probably contract at least 1 percent in 2010, more
than previously forecast, because of the VAT increase and wage
cuts, Finance Minister  Sebastian Vladescu  said on June 29. There
will probably be “higher inflation and a different exchange
rate” because of the tax increase, according to Vladescu, who
declined to give a figure because the ministry is still working
on a new forecast.  
 In its statement, the IMF said it granted Romania a waiver
so it doesn’t have to meet June 2010 targets.  
 The IMF and the government estimate GDP will contract as
much as 0.5 percent this year after shrinking a record 7.1
percent in 2009. The central bank, which left its benchmark rate
unchanged at a record-low 6.25 percent to contain inflation,
forecasts year-end inflation will be 3.7 percent. It will
discuss a new forecast on Aug. 4.
