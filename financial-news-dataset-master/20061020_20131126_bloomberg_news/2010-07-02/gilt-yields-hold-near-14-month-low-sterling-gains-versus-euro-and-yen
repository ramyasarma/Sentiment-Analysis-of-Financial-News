             U.K. bonds fell as an increase in
private-sector employment in the U.S. damped demand for the
relative safety of government  securities .  
 The decline sent the 10-year yield up from near its lowest
in 14 months. The U.S. Labor Department said employment at
companies rose 83,000 even as overall payrolls dropped by
125,000. Economists forecast a decline of 130,000. The pound
reached its highest level in almost two months against the
dollar.  The FTSE 100 Index  of shares climbed 0.7 percent.  
 “Gains in risk assets like stocks took a bit of a shine
from government bonds including gilts,” said  Matteo Regesta , a
fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London. “I
wouldn’t describe the U.S. job report as being strong. But since
the Armageddon scenario didn’t materialize, investors just used
that as an excuse to sell.”  
 The yield on 10-year gilts rose three basis points to 3.35
percent as of 5:20 p.m. in London. It slipped as low as 3.31
percent yesterday. The 4.75 percent security maturing in March
2020 fell 0.26, or 2.6 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
111.47. Two-year note yields rose two basis points to 0.78
percent.  
 Gilts rose on the week, sending the 10-year yield three
basis points lower, as data suggested the global economic
recovery might be losing steam. Manufacturing growth from China
to the U.S. slowed last month, bolstering speculation official
borrowing costs will stay low for longer.  
 Pound Climbs  
 The pound rose as much as 0.3 percent to $1.5229, its
highest since May 4, before trading little changed at $1.5165.
It fell 0.3 percent to 82.82 pence per euro.  
 The British currency posted a fourth weekly gain against the
dollar, the longest streak of gains since March 2008, on
optimism that the government’s moves to cut the deficit will
help the country avoid the soaring debt-servicing costs Greece
has experienced.  
 the U.K.’s top credit rank is based on the country’s “very
high” fundamental economic and institutional strength, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a report.  
 “Despite the questions raised by the abandonment of the
former government’s fiscal rules and the risks taken by the Bank
of England with its quantitative-easing policy, the U.K.’s
institutions are robust and highly competent,” Moody’s said.
The U.K.’s track record on debt repayment since the 17th century
“is unparalleled,” the ratings company said.  
 Breakeven Rates  
 Gilts handed investors a 6.52 percent return this year,
compared with 7.04 percent for German bonds and 6 percent from
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America’s
Merrill Lynch unit.  
 The yield difference between two- and 10-year  notes  narrowed
to 257 basis points, within a basis point of the least this
year, as investors increased bets that sluggish economic
recovery will tame price growth.  
 The U.K. 10-year breakeven  rate , a gauge of price-growth
expectations that measures the difference in yield between
inflation-protected and conventional debt, fell to 2.86
percentage points from 2.96 percentage points last week.
