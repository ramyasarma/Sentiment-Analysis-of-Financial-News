             Hindustan Copper Ltd. , India’s
monopoly producer of the metal ore, hired UBS Securities India
Pvt., ICICI Securities Ltd. and three other banks to manage the
company’s planned share sale.  
 SBI Capital Markets Ltd., Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. and
Enam Securities Direct Pvt. were the other advisers selected,
Hindustan Copper said today on its  website . UBS will be part of
a consortium with SMC Capitals Ltd.  
 Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  aims to raise 400 billion
rupees ($8.6 billion) in the financial year ending March 31
selling shares in state-run companies including  Coal India Ltd. 
and  Steel Authority of India Ltd.  as part of a record asset
selloff.  
 The government will sell a 10 percent stake in Hindustan
Copper, while the Kolkata-based company will sell new shares of
an equal size. The government’s stake will drop to about 81
percent after the issue from 99.59 percent, Chairman  Shakeel Ahmed  said on June 9.  
 Hindustan Copper will seek the approval of the market
regulator by the end of this month for the public offer to raise
about 40 billion rupees, Ahmed said. India’s cabinet approved
the sale in the state-owned company on June 15.  
 Hindustan Copper  shares  rose 0.3 percent to 486.20 rupees
at the end of trading in Mumbai. The benchmark Sensitive Index
of the Bombay Stock Exchange fell 0.3 percent.
