             Raw sugar rose to a 10-week high on
speculation that Russian purchases will increase next month
after the nation lowered its import tax.  
 Russia reduced the duty on raw sugar by 15 percent to $203
a metric ton for August, the nation’s sugar producers union said
today. Prices surged 13 percent last month, halting a four-month
slide, on higher demand.  
 “The Russians may come back to the market,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Group Inc., a broker in
Chicago. “Overall, the demand situation is strong.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery gained 0.42 cent, or 2.6
percent, to 16.7 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the most-active contract rose to 16.72 cents, the
highest level since April 22. The sweetener advanced 1.9 percent
this week, its second straight gain.  
 White-sugar futures for October delivery rose $23.20, or 5
percent, to $491.80 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in
London. The commodity gained 1.5 percent this week.  
 Sugar prices may rise 30 percent this year on growing
demand, low yields and transportation delays for cane crops in
Brazil, according to  Paulo Roberto de Souza , the chief executive
officer of Sao Paulo-based Copersucar SA, a Brazilian
cooperative that exports more sugar than any other entity.  
 Traders and funds are unwinding bets on falling prices,
said  Naim Beydoun , of Rolle, Switzerland-based Swiss Sugar
Brokers. “There are logistics problems” too, including waiting
times of almost 20 days at the port of Santos in Brazil, he
said.
