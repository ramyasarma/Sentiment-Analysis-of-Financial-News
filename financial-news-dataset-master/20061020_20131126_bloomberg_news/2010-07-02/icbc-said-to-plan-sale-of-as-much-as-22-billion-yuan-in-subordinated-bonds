             Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. , the world’s biggest lender by market value, plans to
sell 22 billion yuan ($3.24 billion) of bonds as soon as next
month, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  
 Citic Securities Co., China International Capital Corp. and
Credit Suisse Founder Securities Ltd. will manage the sale,
which may comprise 10- and 15-year subordinated notes, said the
person, who asked not to be identified as they’re not authorized
to discuss the transaction.  
 An ICBC spokesman declined to comment on the company’s
finances or to be named when contacted at the bank’s main office
in Beijing today.  
 Chinese banks have announced plans to raise at least 300
billion yuan from sales of shares and bonds to meet tougher
financial guidelines introduced after an unprecedented 9.59
trillion yuan of new loans last year weakened their capital.
ICBC won shareholder approval in May to sell as much as 25
billion yuan in notes to shore up capital, and to sell shares
equivalent to as much as 20 percent of outstanding equity in
Hong Kong and Shanghai.  
 ICBC has 22 billion yuan of notes due in 2015 that it has
options to redeem in August and September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The coupon on its 13 billion yuan of 3.11
percent subordinated notes will increase to 6.11 percent if it
chooses not to repay them next month, the data show.  
 The bank also plans to raise 25 billion yuan through a sale
of convertible bonds as soon as September, a person with
knowledge of that matter said last month.
