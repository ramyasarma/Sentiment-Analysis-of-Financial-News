             The rand strengthened the most in
four days after slumping to the lowest in three weeks yesterday
on reports that manufacturing growth in South Africa and its
export markets slowed.  
 The rand appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 7.6783
versus the dollar, the strongest gain since June 28, and traded
0.2 percent higher at 7.7222 as of 11:40 a.m. in Johannesburg.
The increase pares the currency’s retreat against the dollar
this week to 1.3 percent.  
 “Yesterday, it had a massive blowout,”  Marc Copeland , a
currency trader at Investec Capital, said of the rand. The rand
will trade in “tight little ranges” until the U.S. payroll
figures are released later today, he said.  
 Manufacturing in China, the world’s fastest-growing major
economy, and the U.S. slowed in June, while more Americans filed
for jobless benefits last week, reports showed yesterday.  
 Government bonds advanced for a third day in South Africa,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
rising 15 cents to 123.21 rand. The yield on the bond fell 3
basis points to 7.94 percent.  
 Investors increased bets the central bank will reduce its
6.5 percent benchmark interest rate when it next meets on July
22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month
contracts  for cash in three months fell 4 basis points, the most
in a month, to 6.37 percent. The rate reached a 6 1/2-year low
of 6.36 percent on April 21.
