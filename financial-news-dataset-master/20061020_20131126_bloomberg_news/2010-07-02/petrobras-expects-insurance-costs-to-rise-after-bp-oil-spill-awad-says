             Petroleo Brasileiro SA expects
insurance costs for offshore oil exploration to rise after BP
Plc’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, said Samir Passos Awad,
the company’s head in the Netherlands.  
 “It’s natural that after an accident like that, insurance
costs will rise,” Awad said in an interview during an Economist
conference in Paris today. “But it’s premature to say anything
else.”  
 Petrobras, as Rio de Janeiro-based company is known, hasn’t
seen any increase in insurance costs yet, he said.
