             Nestle SA , the world’s biggest food
company, plans to spend 150 million Swiss francs ($141 million)
boosting production in  Africa  in an effort to increase its
market share, Chief Executive Officer  Paul Bulcke  said.  
 “The company will build new factories in Angola, the
 Democratic Republic of Congo  and Mozambique and significantly
expand its existing factories in Kenya and Zimbabwe,” he told
reporters today in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.  
 Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, plans to boost its
share of emerging market sales over the next decade to 45
percent from 35 percent now, Bulcke said.  
 In Congo, Nestle is investing 40 million Swiss francs in
its factory in the capital, Kinshasha, while 30 million Swiss
francs is being spent in both Beira, Mozambique, and in Nairobi,
he said. About 50 million Swiss francs will be split between its
operations in Zimbabwe and Angola, Bulcke said.  
 The spending will increase the number of Nestle employees
in the region to 1,500 from about 700 now, he said.
