             Jaypee Infratech Ltd. was rated
“equal-weight” in new coverage by Morgan Stanley analysts
Sameer Baisiwala and Arunabh Chaudhari, who said the value in
the company’s assets may take as many as 24 months to be
unlocked and that its near-term earnings are dependent on one
“micro market” that may slow in coming quarters despite its
“strong potential.”  
 The analysts have a share-price estimate of 85 rupees.
