             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s  U.S.
merchandising chief will leave the world’s largest retailer
after a plan to remove some products from stores contributed to
a decline in sales.  
 John Fleming  will depart on Aug. 1, Wal-Mart said today in
a  regulatory filing . Until a replacement is named, Wal-Mart gave
additional duties to  Jack Sinclair , head of the U.S. grocery
unit, and  John Westling , executive vice president of planning,
pricing and replenishment, U.S. Chief Executive Officer  William Simon  told employees in a memo today.  
 Fleming, an executive vice president, made a “personal
decision” to depart, Simon said in the memo. Sales at U.S.
stores open at least a year have fallen for four straight
quarters, hurt by the removal of grocery and household items.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is returning some items
and cutting prices to draw shoppers.  
 Simon took charge of U.S. stores, Wal-Mart’s largest unit,
from  Eduardo Castro-Wright  on June 29. Castro-Wright was
reassigned to California, where his wife is recovering from
surgery.  
 Fleming, 51, wasn’t available for an interview, said  David Tovar , a Wal-Mart spokesman.  
 “John’s been thinking about how he could spend more time
with his family,” Tovar said in a telephone interview. “The
changes announced earlier this week presented him with an
opportunity and he decided it was the right time for him to
leave the company.”  
 Fleming joined Wal-Mart in 2001 after serving as senior
vice president of merchandising for  Target Corp.’s  department
store division. He had worked 19 years for the Minneapolis-based
retailer.  
 Wal-Mart  fell  34 cents to $48 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 10 percent
this year.
