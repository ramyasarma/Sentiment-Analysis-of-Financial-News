             Lebanon’s Energy and Water Minister
 Gebran Bassil  has proposed spending $4.87 billion to boost power
production to 4,000 megawatts in 2014 from 1,500 MW, the  Daily
Star  reported, citing a plan submitted by Bassil to the cabinet.  
 The government would spend $1.55 billion on the program,
private businesses $2.32 billion, and the remaining $1 billion
would come in the form of soft loans from donor countries, the
Beirut-based  newspaper  said.  
 The plan calls for investing $1.65 billion more in the
future to increase output to 5,000 MW, the  newspaper  reported.
It also proposes investing in convertible energy and wind run
power mills and recycled trash, which could produce about 12
percent of Lebanon’s power generation in 2014, the Star said.  
 If the plan isn’t adopted, state-run  Electricite du Liban ,
which provides more than 90 percent of the country’s
electricity, will have total losses of $9.5 billion by 2015, the
 newspaper  said. The government spent $514 million in the first
five months of the year subsidizing Electricite du Liban, the
finance ministry said this week, after spending about $1.5
billion last year on the company.
