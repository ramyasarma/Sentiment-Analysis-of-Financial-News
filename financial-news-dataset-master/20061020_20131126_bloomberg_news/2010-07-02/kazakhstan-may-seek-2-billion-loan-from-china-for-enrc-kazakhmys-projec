             Kazakhstan may seek $2 billion in
Chinese loans to build smelters and help meet the country’s plan
to double metal output by 2015, with money going to companies
such as Kazakhmys Plc and Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.  
 The state-owned National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna is
“considering financing of new smelters of about $2 billion,”
Chief Executive Officer  Kairat Kelimbetov  said by e-mail today.
The money will be “either for Kazakhmys, Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp. or other Kazakh companies,” he said.  
 Kazakhstan plans to double the production and export of
metals in five years, President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  said in
January. Kazakhmys and  ENRC , the world’s largest producer of
ferrochrome on a chrome-content basis, have already sought
investment from China for new smelters and mines.  
 Samruk-Kazyna will also seek more than $1 billion from
China to build a railroad from Zhetygen, near the financial
capital Almaty, to Khorgos, a customs terminal on the Chinese
border, Kelimbetov said. ENRC last year pulled out of the rail
project to connect its plants to China after failing to get an
agreement from the Kazakhstan government for the project.
