             U.S. stocks trimmed losses as gains
in health-care and telephone companies helped the market recover
from an earlier slump spurred by concern the economic rebound is
slowing.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent to
1,024.75 after losing as much as 1.1 percent earlier. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average fell 31.21 points, or 0.3 percent, to
9,701.32, paring a 118.21-point slide.
