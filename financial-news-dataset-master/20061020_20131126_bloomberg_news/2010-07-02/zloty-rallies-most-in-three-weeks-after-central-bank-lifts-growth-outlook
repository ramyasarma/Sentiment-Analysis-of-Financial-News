             The zloty jumped the most in almost
three weeks against the euro after the Polish central bank said
it raised its economic growth forecast for next year to 4.6
percent from a February estimate of 2.9 percent.  
 The zloty added 0.9 percent to 4.1378 per euro, paring
yesterday’s 1 percent drop and reducing this week’s decline to
0.5 percent. It was the zloty’s largest intraday appreciation
since June 14 and the second-biggest gain among more than 170
global currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after Fiji’s dollar.  
 Output will rise 3.2 percent this year, compared with an
earlier forecast of 3.1 percent, the bank said in its GDP and
Inflation Projection sent by e-mail today.
