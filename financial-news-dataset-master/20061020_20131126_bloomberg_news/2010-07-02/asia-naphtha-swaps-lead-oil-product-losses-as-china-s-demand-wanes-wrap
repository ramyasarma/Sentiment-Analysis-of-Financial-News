             Asia naphtha swaps led product losses
as demand in China slowed on signs that growth in the world’s
fastest-expanding major economy is cooling. Gasoil refining
margins rose.  
 Naphtha  swaps for August dropped for a fourth day, losing
$2.40 to $67.63 a barrel at 10:07 a.m. Singapore time, according
to data from broker PVM Oil Associates.  Gasoil  slipped $1.66 to
$82.85 a barrel while  fuel oil  swaps dropped $8.13 to $426 a
metric ton.  
 China’s manufacturing growth slowed for a second month in
June. Naphtha exports from Europe to Asia may drop to zero this
month as demand from Chinese chemical producers slows, a
Bloomberg survey of traders yesterday showed.  
 Gasoil processing profits fell 33 cents to $12.15 a barrel,
PVM data showed.  Fuel oil  and naphtha refining margins in Asia
were unchanged. Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude was at $5.89
a barrel while  naphtha’s  discount was at $2.81 a barrel.  
 Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the first
half of August were bid at $620 a ton against offers at $623 at
9:40 a.m., data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte showed.  
 Naphtha  for delivery in the second half of August and the
first half of September closed at $634.50 a ton yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
