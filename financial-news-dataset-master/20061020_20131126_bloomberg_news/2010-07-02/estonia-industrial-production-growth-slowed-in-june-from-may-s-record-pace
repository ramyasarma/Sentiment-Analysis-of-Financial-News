             Estonian  industrial production  growth
slowed in May from a record pace a month earlier as domestic
demand remained weak.  
 Production increased 17.1 percent from a year earlier,
compared with an 18.4 percent rise the previous month, the
highest since at least 2000, the Tallinn-based statistics office
said on its w ebsite  today. Output rose 2 percent from the
previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.  
 “We expect month-on-month growth to continue,” said
 Annika Lindblad , an economist with Nordea AB in Helsinki, ahead
of the report. “Due to weak domestic demand, the recovery is
seen gradual, as the revival relies heavily on export demand.”  
 Confidence among industrial companies worsened in June to
minus 2 points from plus one point in May, the first decline in
a year, according to seasonally adjusted data from the Tallinn-
based  Konjunktuuriinstituut  research institute.  
 Domestic sales of manufacturing shrank 6 percent from a
year earlier, compared with a 12 percent-decline in April, the
office said. Manufacturing exports, led by wireless network gear
and wind generators made by local units of Sweden’s  Ericsson AB 
and Zurich-based  ABB Ltd ., grew an annual 46 percent, compared
with a 36 percent rise the previous month, the statistics office
said.
