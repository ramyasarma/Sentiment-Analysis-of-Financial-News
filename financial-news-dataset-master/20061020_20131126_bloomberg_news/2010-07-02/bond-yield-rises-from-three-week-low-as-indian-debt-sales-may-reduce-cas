             India’s  10-year bonds  declined,
snapping a four-day gain, on speculation a government debt sale
today will further reduce  cash at banks that can be invested in
the securities.   
 Yields rose from a three-week low on concern last week’s
increase in fuel prices will spur  inflation  and prompt the
 central bank  to raise interest rates. India will sell 100
billion rupees ($2.1 billion) of bonds maturing in seven, 12 and
30 years.  
 “The auction comes amid tight liquidity,” said
 Krishnamurthy Harihar , treasurer at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai.
“The increase in petrol and diesel prices has brought inflation
worries to the fore.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose one
basis point to 7.53 percent as of 9:40 a.m. in Mumbai, according
to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell 0.09, or 9
paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 101.84.  
 Banks borrowed an average 486 billion rupees a day from the
central bank through its repurchase-auction window last month,
which pushed up interbank overnight rates and raised the cost of
funding to buy bonds. In May, they lent a daily average of 328
billion rupees.  
 Prices of gasoline and diesel would be market driven, the
government said on June 25. The central bank’s next policy
meeting is scheduled for July 27.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, was 5.43 percent, compared with 5.42 percent yesterday.
