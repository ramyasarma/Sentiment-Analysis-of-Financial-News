             The Spanish government may reduce the
fees that  Red Electrica Corp. SA  earns for transporting
electricity as part of its plan to reduce power costs,  El
Economista  reported.  
 Industry Minister  Miguel Sebastian  is also considering cuts
in the rates that nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar plant
operators earn in order to bring wholesale power prices into
line with the tariff that consumers pay by 2013, the newspaper
said, without disclosing how it obtained the information.  
 Under Spain’s fixed-price system for electricity, consumers
have paid less than the wholesale price in recent years building
up a debt to utilities of about 16 billion euros.  
 Red Electrica Chairman  Luis Atienza  said he was prepared to
work with the government, adding that the cost of power
transmission is “marginal” in the overall electricity bill,
the newspaper said.
