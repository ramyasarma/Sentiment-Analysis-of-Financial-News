             European  stocks  gained, rebounding
from a five-week low for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as the U.S.
jobless rate unexpectedly declined.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd., Rio Tinto Group and Xstrata Plc
increased after the Australian government scaled back a proposed
tax on mining companies. Dana Petroleum Plc jumped 20 percent
after the Scottish oil explorer received a takeover approach
from Korea National Oil Corp. Genmab A/S surged 50 percent after
a revised agreement with partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc reduced the
risk of a new share sale.  
 The Stoxx 600 added 0.4 percent to 238.34 at 1:57 p.m. in
London. The gauge has declined 12 percent from this year’s high
on April 15, pushing its  valuation  to 11 times reported
earnings, the lowest level since 2008, according to Bloomberg
data. The index is heading for a weekly decline of 4 percent as
concern deepens that the world economy is slowing.  
 The U.S. jobless rate fell to 9.5 percent in June from 9.7
percent the previous month as the labor force shrank, Labor
Department figures showed today. Payrolls declined by 125,000 as
the government cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010
census. Employment at companies rose 83,000.
