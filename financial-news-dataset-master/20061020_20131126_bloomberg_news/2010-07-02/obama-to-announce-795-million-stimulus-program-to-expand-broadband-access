             President  Barack Obama  today will
announce $795 million in government grants and loans to expand
broadband access by building network infrastructure and public
computing centers.  
 The projects, part of the $862 billion economic stimulus
program passed last year, will create about 5,000 jobs at 66
projects in communities without adequate access to high-speed
Internet service, according to a White House statement.  
 “This is an opportunity for us to expand this 21st century
infrastructure,” Agriculture Secretary  Tom Vilsack  said in a
conference call yesterday with reporters.  
 The grants and loans, administered by the Departments of
Commerce and Agriculture, have been matched by more than $200
million of outside investment for total spending of more than $1
billion, according to the White House statement.  
 The projects will expand high-speed Internet access to some
of the 36 percent of Americans who lack the service by deploying
more than 6,000 miles of new fiber-optic cable.  
 Commerce Secretary  Gary Locke  said the federal spending
will also encourage private-sector involvement.  
 “This program is a textbook investment done right, where
government startup funding catalyzes billions of dollars in
private investment,” he said.
