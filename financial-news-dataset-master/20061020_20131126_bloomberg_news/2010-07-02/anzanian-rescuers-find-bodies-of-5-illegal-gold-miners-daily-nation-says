             Rescuers in Tanzania found the bodies
of five small-scale gold miners who were buried underground
after they illegally entered a pit to search for the precious
metal in the western Kagera region, the  Daily News  reported.  
 Search teams rescued five men suffering serious injuries
while more miners are believed to be still trapped, the state-
run Dar es Salaam-based newspaper reported today, citing Henry
Salewi, Kagera Regional Police Commander. The incident occurred
on June 29, the newspaper reported.  
 The miners had invaded the site of the Tulawaka gold mine
owned by  African Barrick Gold Ltd. , it said.  
 Calls outside regular working hours to the mobile phone of
Barrick’s spokesman in Tanzania, Teweli K. Teweli, didn’t
connect and e-mailed questions to him were not immediately
answered. Tanzania is Africa’s fourth-largest gold producer
after South Africa, Ghana and Mali.
