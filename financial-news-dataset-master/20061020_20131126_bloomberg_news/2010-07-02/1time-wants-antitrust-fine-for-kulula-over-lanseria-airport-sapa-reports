             1Time Holdings Ltd., a South African
low-cost airline, wants the nation’s competition authority to
impose a penalty on Kulula.com, the low-fare airline owned by
Comair Ltd., the South African Press Association reported.  
 1Time asked the Competition Tribunal to fine Kulula as much
as 10 percent of its turnover in the last financial year because
of an exclusive agreement it has for flights from Lanseria
Airport, northwest of Johannesburg, the Johannesburg-based news
service reported, citing a statement from the tribunal, which
will hear 1Time’s application to amend its original complaint to
include the fine today.
