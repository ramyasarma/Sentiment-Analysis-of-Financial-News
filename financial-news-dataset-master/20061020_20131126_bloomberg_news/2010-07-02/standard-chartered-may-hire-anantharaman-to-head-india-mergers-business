             Standard Chartered Plc plans to hire
 Venkat Anantharaman  back from  Credit Suisse AG  to head its
mergers advisory business in India, said a person with knowledge
of the matter.  
 Anantharaman has resigned from Zurich-based Credit Suisse,
where he was a senior coverage banker, two people with knowledge
of the move said, requesting anonymity because the matter is
private. Anantharaman declined to comment when reached by phone.  
 Anantharaman left  Standard Chartered  in 2006 for Credit
Suisse, where he was head of investment banking for India until
April, when the Swiss bank announced the appointment of Vedika
Bhandarkar to that role. Bhandarkar will join Credit Suisse this
month from JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Standard Chartered ranks third this year in advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions in India, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit Suisse is No. 30, the data
show.  
 Adam Harper , a spokesman for Credit Suisse in Hong Kong,
and  Arijit De , a spokesman for Standard Chartered in Mumbai,
declined to comment.
