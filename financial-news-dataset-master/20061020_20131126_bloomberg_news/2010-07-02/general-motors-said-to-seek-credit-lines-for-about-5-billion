             General Motors Co. is talking with a
number of banks about setting up a revolving line of credit that
may be worth $5 billion or more, said two people with knowledge
of the plan.  
 The automaker could use the credit line to pay business
costs while using its cash to pay off more expensive debt, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
plan is private. GM also wants to get a line of credit to
establish relationships between the company and a variety of
banks, the people said.  
 The arrangements aren’t complete and the values may change,
both people said.  
 Noreen Pratscher, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based GM,
declined to comment.  
 The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on GM seeking a
line of credit.  
 GM is also talking with several major banks to arrange more
options for customers’ car loans, one of the people said. GM
uses  Ally Financial Inc. , formerly GMAC LLC, for the bulk of its
auto lending. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp handles leasing and
 AmeriCredit Corp.  of Fort Worth, Texas, does subprime lending
for GM’s customers and dealers.  
 GM Chief Financial Officer  Chris Liddell  said at an
investor conference June 29 that GM will look at a variety of
lending sources for consumer car loans rather than carrying the
assets and liabilities of an in-house lending business on its
own books.
