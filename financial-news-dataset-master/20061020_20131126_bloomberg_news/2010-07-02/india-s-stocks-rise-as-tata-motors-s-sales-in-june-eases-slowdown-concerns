             Indian stocks fell, with the
benchmark index declining for the first time in three weeks.
 Infosys Technologies Ltd.  dropped as the central bank said the
country has become more vulnerable to global markets.  
 Software exporter Infosys retreated for a fourth day after
the Reserve Bank of India said yesterday foreign trade plays a
bigger role in the economy, exposing the country to slowdowns
and financial crises.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the
biggest copper and zinc producer, lost 2.1 percent.  
 “Investors can hold cash for now and wait for a
correction,” said  R.K. Gupta , portfolio manager and managing
director at Taurus Asset Management in New Delhi. “If at all,
they can bet on the domestic growth story.” Gupta declined to
name specific stocks.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 48.38, or 0.3 percent, to 17,460.95. The gauge declined 0.7
percent this week, after gaining the previous two. The S&P CNX
 Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost 0.3 percent to
5,237.10. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.3 percent to 2,223.59.  
 Infosys, the second-largest software services exporter that
gets almost all of its sales abroad, slid 1.4 percent to 2,727.5
rupees. Sterlite, the biggest copper producer that derives about
a third of its revenue outside of India, fell 2.1 percent to
160.7 rupees.  
 “The shift in the composition of aggregate demand towards
exports during the current decade has made the Indian economy
more susceptible to global developments,” the Reserve Bank of
India’s research department said yesterday.  
 Trade, GDP  
 Trade represented 35 percent of gross domestic product for
the year to March 31, 2008, up from 21 percent a decade earlier,
according to the central bank.  
 Hindustan Petroleum Corp. , the third-biggest state-run
refiner, rose 1.1 to 475.2 rupees, its highest level since 1994.
The shares have soared 35 percent in the six trading sessions
since the government freed gasoline and other fuel prices.  
 India’s state refiners will decide on a pricing mechanism
for gasoline in two to three weeks, Oil Secretary S. Sundareshan
said in Bangalore today.  
 Bharat Petroleum Corp.  gained 1 percent to 666.75 rupees,
the highest in almost 16 years. India’s No. 2 state refiner
today said it began production at a 6 million metric ton-a-year
crude distillation unit on June 29.  
 Overseas  funds  sold a net  1.76 billion rupees  ($37.9
million) of Indian equities on June 29, paring their investments
in the stocks this year to 310.8 billion rupees, according to
the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd.  (MISP IN), a sponge-iron maker,
jumped 16 percent to 468.45 rupees, its highest level since
September 2008, after Blackstone Group LP, the world’s biggest
private-equity firm, said it will buy a stake in its power unit.  
 NIIT Ltd.  (NIIT IN) climbed 3.3 percent to 65.75 rupees.
The software company was raised to “buy” from “sell” by
Citigroup Inc. analysts  Vishal Agarwal  and  Surendra Goyal , who
cited the stock’s “reasonable valuations” and improving
operating metrics. The analysts raised their share-price
estimate to 85 rupees from 50 rupees.  
 Persistent Systems Ltd. (PSYS IN) soared 10 percent to
474.55 rupees. The software company was rated “outperform” in
new coverage by Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by  Sunil Tirumalai , who said the stock should trade at a premium to its
peers given its growth and margin profile. The analysts have a
share-price estimate of 540 rupees.
