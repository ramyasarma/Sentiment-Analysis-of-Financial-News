             Canada’s dollar weakened versus its
U.S. counterpart as traders trimmed bets the nation’s central
bank will raise interest rates at its meeting this month amid
signs the North American recovery may be faltering.  
 Canada’s currency, known as the loonie, traded near the
lowest level in almost a month before a report forecast to show
U.S. employers cut payrolls by 130,000 positions in June. The
currency dropped in the three months through June 30 for the
first time in five quarters. Crude oil, the nation’s biggest
export, declined.  
 “Confidence is weak globally,”  Firas Askari , head currency
trader in Toronto at Bank of Montreal, said in an e-mail.
“Crude is down substantially. Bank of Canada hikes, extent and
timing, are being priced out, with only the July meeting
currently having more than a 50 percent chance of a 25 basis
point hike. All this is hurting our loonie.”  
 The Canadian currency fell 0.3 percent to C$1.0623 per U.S.
dollar at 8:16 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0596
yesterday, when it reached C$1.0675, the weakest level since
June 7. One Canadian dollar buys 94.11 U.S. cents.  
 Overnight index swaps, which measure what traders believe
the central bank’s benchmark policy rate will average over a
certain period, “suggest that odds of a July 20 rate hike from
the Bank of Canada have dropped to 45 percent,” from 80 percent
on June 21, CIBC World Markets’  Olga Dadabayeva  and  Shane Enright , currency analysts in Toronto, wrote in a note to
clients. “All eyes will be on today’s release of U.S. June non-
farm payrolls, where expectations have steadily dimmed
throughout the week.”
