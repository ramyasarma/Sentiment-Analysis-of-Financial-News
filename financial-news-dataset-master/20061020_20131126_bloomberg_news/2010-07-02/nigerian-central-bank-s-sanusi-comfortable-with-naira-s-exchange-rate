             Nigeria is “comfortable” with
current naira levels and believes the currency is unlikely to
come under pressure, with foreign reserves capable of funding 17
months of imports, central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  
 The currency of Africa’s second-biggest economy appreciated
to the strongest level in more than three months versus the
dollar, strengthening 0.1 percent to 149.7 naira by the close
yesterday in Lagos, the commercial hub.  
 “The bank is comfortable with the current exchange rate,”
Sanusi said in an interview in London yesterday. The stable
exchange rate has helped keep Nigeria’s inflation between 10.4
percent and 12.5 percent since June last year. “The system will
only come under strain when foreign reserves fall to less than
12 months of imports.”  
 Nigeria’s foreign reserves, the source of funding for the
central bank’s twice-weekly auction of currencies to banks,
stood at $37.2 billion  as of June 29 , compared with a high of
$58.3 billion in March 2008. The bank supplied $10.8 billion to
lenders seeking $9.7 billion at foreign-exchange auctions since
the start of the year and sold $250 million at yesterday’s sale
at rates of between 148.5 to 148.65 naira per dollar.  
 Nigeria, which depends on oil exports for more than 95
percent of foreign-exchange income according to the Finance
Ministry, experienced a decline in reserves as oil prices
plunged following the global financial crisis. Oil is trading 49
percent below its high of $145.29 reached in July 2008.  
 Foreign-exchange supply by the central bank has kept pace
with demand since the naira traded at a six-month low against
the dollar on May 18.  
 Currency Defense  
 “The fall in Nigeria’s reserves reflects the authorities’
attempts to defend the currency amid a more general global
trend, which has seen other emerging-market currencies and
reserve positions come under similar pressure,”  Stuart Culverhouse , the London-based chief economist of Exotix Ltd.,
said in a note to clients on June 23. Exotix gets a quarter of
its revenue from African securities and three quarters from
frontier markets.  
 Nigeria can afford to spend $12.5 billion to sustain the
exchange rate at current levels for the next three months, with
at least $26 billion remaining in reserves, he said.  
 The West African nation should be able to meet its foreign-
exchange demand for many months to come,  Ayo Teriba  of Lagos-
based Economic Associates Ltd. said in an interview last week.
“There will be no reason to significantly deplete the foreign
reserves,” he said.
