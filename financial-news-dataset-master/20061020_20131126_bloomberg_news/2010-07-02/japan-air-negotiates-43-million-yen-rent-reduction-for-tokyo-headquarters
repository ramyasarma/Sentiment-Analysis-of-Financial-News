             Japan Airlines Corp. , undergoing a
government-backed turnaround in bankruptcy, negotiated a
reduction in rent for its headquarters in Tokyo as it works to
slash costs and return to profit.  
 The carrier’s monthly rent will be cut by 43.3 million yen
($492,000) from this month until March and the airline will
reduce the amount of space it rents from April,  Nomura Real
Estate Asset Management Co. , the manager of the building, said
in a June 30 statement on its website.  
 Sze Hunn Yap , a spokeswoman at JAL, confirmed the rent
reduction in a telephone call today.
