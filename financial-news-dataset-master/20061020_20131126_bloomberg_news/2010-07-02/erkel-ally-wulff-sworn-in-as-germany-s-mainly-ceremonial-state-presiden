             Christian Wulff was sworn in as
Germany’s largely ceremonial president today in Berlin. Wulff,
51, took the oath of office at a ceremony in parliament after
his June 30 election by a special assembly of federal lawmakers
and representatives from the 16 states.   
 Wulff, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian
Democrats, was elected after three rounds of voting in which
some of Merkel’s supporters withheld their support.
