             The  International Finance Corp.  plans
to focus on supporting investment in agricultural projects in
Arab countries to help boost food production, a senior manager
at the World Bank unit said.  
 “We’ve been giving a great emphasis to infrastructure and
financing projects in past years, now we want to fund more
agricultural projects,” Walid al-Murshed, Saudi country for the
IFC, said in a telephone interview today.  
 The IFC invested around $2 billion to support foreign
direct investment between Arab countries over the past three
years, he added.  
 Around 39 percent of the investment was directed to
infrastructure projects and 38 percent went to financial
investment, al-Murshed said,
