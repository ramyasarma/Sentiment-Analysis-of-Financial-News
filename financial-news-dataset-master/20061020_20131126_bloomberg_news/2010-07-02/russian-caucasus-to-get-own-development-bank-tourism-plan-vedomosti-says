             Russia’s North Caucasus region will
get its own development bank to finance projects in tourism,
transportation and energy, Vedomosti reported today, citing a
draft plan prepared by the Ministry of Regional Development.  
 Under the 2025 plan for the region, the bank’s capital will
be made up of contributions from Vnesheconombank, Russia’s state
development bank, other Russian banks and the state budget, the
Moscow-based  newspaper  reported. The draft doesn’t detail the
overall investment required for the region, Vedomosti said.  
 Alexander Khloponin , who was made a Kremlin envoy to the
North Caucasus Federal District in January, will head the new
development institution. The North Caucasus development plan
will be discussed during Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s visit
to the city of Pyatigorsk in southern Russia on July 7, Russian
 Newsweek  magazine reported yesterday.  
 The region, which includes Chechnya, is plagued by an
Islamic insurgency, Russia’s highest unemployment rates and
corruption. Attacks by Islamic militants last year plunged the
North Caucasus into its worst instability since Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin sent troops to subdue a rebellion a decade ago.
