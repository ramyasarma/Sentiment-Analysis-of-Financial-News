             U.S. stocks erased losses amid
speculation investors were closing out bearish positions after
the two-month slide in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index left it
trading at its cheapest valuation in a year.     
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,027.4 at 3:40 p.m. in New York after earlier slumping as much
as 1.1 percent and extending its retreat from its 2010 high in
April to more than 16 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
slipped less than 1 point to 9,731.59 after tumbling 118 points
earlier.   
 “It’s nothing more than squaring positions before a long
weekend,” said Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort
Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati, which oversees
more than $30 billion.
