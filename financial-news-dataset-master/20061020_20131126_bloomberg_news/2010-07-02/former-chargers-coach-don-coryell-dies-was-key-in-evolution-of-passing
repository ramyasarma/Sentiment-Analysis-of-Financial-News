             Don Coryell , a longtime college and
professional football coach whose offensive innovations helped
in the evolution of the modern passing game, has died after a
long illness. He was 85.  
 Coryell died yesterday at a California hospital, the
National Football League’s San Diego Chargers said in a news
release.  
 “He revolutionized the game of football, not only in San
Diego but throughout the entire NFL,” Chargers President  Dean Spanos  said.  
 Coryell coached at San Diego State University in 1961-1972,
compiling a record of 104-19-2. He led the NFL’s St. Louis
Cardinals to two division titles and a 42-29-1 record from 1973-
1977 and took the Chargers to two American Football Conference
championship games and a 72-60 record while coaching there from
1978-1986. His overall NFL record, including playoffs, was 114-
89-1.  
 With  Dan Fouts  at quarterback, the “Air Coryell” Chargers
of the early 1980s redefined the passing game by expanding the
receiving roles of the tight end and running backs. Fouts set
NFL passing records with 4,715 yards in 1980 and 4,802 yards in
1981.
