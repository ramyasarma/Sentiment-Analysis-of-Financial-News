             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index gained,
paring its first weekly loss in a month, as metals advanced and
investors speculated a sell-off was overdone, overshadowing a
drop in payrolls and factory orders in the U.S.  
 MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA , the iron-ore producer
controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , rose on higher
metals prices.  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA  led
homebuilders up after the benchmark real-estate gauge slid 5
percent this week before today. Gains were limited by a drop in
 Fibria Celulose SA , the world’s largest pulp producer, which
fell amid speculation slowing global growth will hurt demand.  
 The  Bovespa  index rose 0.3 percent to 61,429.79, paring a
weekly retreat to 5.2 percent. Thirty-four stocks gained on the
index while 27 fell. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap  index increased
1.1 percent to 1,146.15. The real strengthened for a third day,
rising 0.9 percent to 1.7754 per dollar.  
 “The unemployment numbers in the U.S. were already well
priced in,” said  Joao Pedro Brugger , who helps oversee 70
million reais ($39.4 million) at Leme Investimentos in
Florianopolis, Brazil. “The market suffered a lot in the past
days, so it may be a moment of correction. The declines were
exaggerated.”  
 Trading  today slowed as Brazil’s national soccer team faced
the Netherlands in a World Cup quarterfinal match, losing 2-1,
while the U.S. prepared for the July 4 holiday that will close
exchanges the following day. Sao Paulo traded 3.8 billion reais
in equities, 44 percent lower than the one-year average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The Bovespa fluctuated earlier in the day, falling as much
as 0.8 percent, following reports that indicated dimming growth
prospects in the U.S., the second-biggest buyer of Brazilian
exports.  
 Factory Orders  
 Orders placed with U.S. factories declined in May more than
forecast, a sign that manufacturing may be starting to cool. The
1.4 percent decrease in bookings was the biggest since March
2009 and followed a revised 1 percent gain in April, the
Commerce Department said today in Washington. Economists
forecast orders would drop 0.5 percent, according to the median
projection in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 A separate report showed U.S. employment fell in June for
the first time this year. Payrolls declined by 125,000 last
month as the government cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting
the 2010 census, Labor Department figures in Washington showed
today. Economists projected a decline of 130,000, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate
fell to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent as the labor force shrank.  
 Growth Forecast  
 Fibria  fell 2.5 percent to 26.29 reais after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its growth forecast for China this year to 10.1
percent from 11.4 percent as government restrictions on lending
and real estate slow expansion in the world’s fastest-growing
major economy.  
 Goldman Sachs joins BNP Paribas, Macquarie Securities Ltd.
and China International Capital Corp. in reducing estimates as
the government tightens property restrictions to prevent
overheating. A third of China economists may cut “overly
bullish” forecasts for 2010 and 2011 in coming weeks, Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch economist  Lu Ting  said in a June 30 note
to clients.  
 Share Sale  
 Brazilian stocks rose yesterday as banks rallied following
 Banco do Brasil SA ’s 9.76 billion-real share sale. The lender
gained 1.3 percent to 26.50 reais today.  
 MMX Mineracao  gained for the first time in five days,
increasing 2.4 percent to 10.65 reais. State oil company
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA  gained 1.2 percent to 26.77 reais after
Brazil’s energy minister said the firm’s planned $25 billion
share sale and oil-for-stock swap won’t be derailed by October
presidential elections.  
 MRV Engenharia , Brazil’s fifth-biggest homebuilder by
revenue, jumped 3.6 percent to 13.38 reais, helping push the
 BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index  up 1.4 percent.  
 The Bovespa index  trades  for 12.4 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.4 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index  of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.6
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.9 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
