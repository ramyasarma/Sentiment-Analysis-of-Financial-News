             All-Star forward  Paul Pierce  agreed
to terms on a new contract with the Boston Celtics, according to
the Boston Herald.  
 Pierce, who has played his entire 12-year career for the
Celtics, reached agreement on a four-year, $61 million contract,
with options for both sides after three years, the newspaper
said on its  website , citing unnamed people familiar with the
agreement. The contract can’t be officially signed and announced
until July 8.  
 Pierce, 32, opted out of the final year of his last
contract, becoming an unrestricted free agent yesterday. He was
scheduled to receive $21.5 million, and will now have a more
secure future while giving the Celtics more flexibility,
according to the Herald.  
 The eight-time All-Star has a career scoring average of
22.5 points per game. His 18.3 scoring average last season led
the Celtics, who reached the National Basketball Association
Finals for the second time in three years, falling to the Los
Angeles Lakers in seven games.
