             Brazil’s real rose for a third
straight day as lower-than-forecast gains in U.S. private sector
payrolls and average hourly earnings weakened the dollar against
the currency of Latin America’s largest economy.  
 The real climbed 0.8 percent to 1.7773 per dollar at 9:17
a.m. New York time, from 1.7911 yesterday. The currency has
risen 0.1 percent this week.  
 U.S. private payrolls rose by 83,000 last month, Labor
Department figures in Washington showed today. Economists
projected a gain of 110,000, according to the median forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey of 50 economists.  
 “Weakness in private sector payrolls and hourly earnings
has weighed on the dollar, and that’s why the dollar-real has
headed lower,” said  Nick Chamie , global head of emerging
markets research at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.32 percent.
