             The Iranian  Central Bank  needs more
independence from the government in order to combat inflation,
according to the country’s Parliament Research Center.  
 The bank scored 31 percent in a study carried out to
measure its independence from the government, the research
center said on its  website  today. Control over monetary policy
should be in the hands of an autonomous body in order to reduce
inflation, it said.  
 Iran’s monetary and banking laws have not undergone
significant change since their introduction 38 years ago, while
the inflation rate has not fallen below 11 percent in the past
17 years, the research center said.  
 Iran is dependent on oil to finance budget spending, and
the foreign currency proceeds from crude sales are managed by
the Central Bank. The bank’s governor is selected in a process
that can be controlled by government, the center has said in
earlier reports.
