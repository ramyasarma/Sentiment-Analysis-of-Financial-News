             Standard Chartered Plc  cut this
year’s forecasts for the Indian rupee by as much as 8 percent,
saying the financial crisis will undermine the economic recovery.  
 The British bank that earns most of its profit in Asia
lowered its estimate for the rupee to 47 per dollar by Sept. 30
and 45.5 by Dec. 31, from 43.5 and 43,  Priyanka Chakravarty , a
Mumbai-based currency strategist at Standard Chartered, said in
an interview today. India’s widening  trade deficit  will also
weigh on the currency, she said.  
 “Persistent sovereign concerns about the euro area and a
sharp global slowdown pose the biggest risks to the rupee’s
medium-term prospects,” Chakravarty said. “Capital flows have
been fickle this year and India’s trade deficit is becoming
worrisome.”  
 The rupee fell 0.8 percent this week to 46.67 per dollar as
of 11:18 in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
