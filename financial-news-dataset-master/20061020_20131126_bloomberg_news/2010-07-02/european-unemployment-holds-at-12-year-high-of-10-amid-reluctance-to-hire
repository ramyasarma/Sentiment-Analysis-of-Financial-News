             European  unemployment  held at the
highest in almost 12 years in May as the debt crisis made
companies reluctant to add workers.  
 The  jobless rate  in the 16-nation euro area remained at 10
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. That’s the highest since August 1998. The April
figure was revised down from a previously reported 10.1 percent.
 Producer-price inflation  accelerated to 3.1 percent in May from
2.8 percent in April, a separate release showed.  
 European companies may keep hiring plans on hold as the
recovery shows signs of losing momentum. Governments have
stepped up spending cuts to reduce budget deficits and restore
investor confidence, which may curb demand in the region.
 Manufacturing  growth slowed for a second month in June and
German  investor confidence  declined the most since October 2008.  
 The unemployment figures “add to evidence that domestic
demand will remain weak in the second half of the year,” said
 Ben May , an economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in London.
“Even if unemployment does begin to fall, wage growth is likely
to slow in response to the earlier rise in unemployment.”  
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.2504
as of 10:05 a.m. in London, taking its decline this year to 13
percent. The yield on the 10-year German bund was little changed
at 2.57 percent, within five basis points of the three-week low
of 2.526 percent reached June 29.  
 Job Cuts  
 In the 27-member European Union,  unemployment  held at 9.6
percent. Five member states had a drop in unemployment from a
year earlier, while 22 countries reported an increase. At 19.9
percent, Spain had the highest jobless rate in the euro region.  
 The number of jobless in the euro area rose 35,000 in May
from April. The unemployment total has increased by almost 1
million people in the last year.  
 Companies are still eliminating jobs and paring costs to
protect earnings.  Metro AG , the world’s third-largest retailer,
based in Dusseldorf, Germany, said June 18 it will close three
wholesale stores and cut about 900 jobs after failing to turn
the outlets around.  
 Costs of intermediate goods rose 3.9 percent in May from a
year earlier while energy prices surged 7 percent, today’s
producer-price report showed. Producer prices of capital goods
and durable consumer goods also increased from May 2009. In the
month,  producer prices  rose 0.3 percent.  
 The European Central Bank on June 10 lowered its euro-
region growth forecast for next year to about 1.2 percent from
1.5 percent. In 2010, the economy may expand around 1 percent,
the central bank forecast.  
 ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said on that day that
while the euro-region economy may grow at a “moderate and still
uneven pace over time,” a recovery may be held back by “weak
labor-market prospects.” The European Commission said on June
21 that it may take “some time” for employment to improve.
