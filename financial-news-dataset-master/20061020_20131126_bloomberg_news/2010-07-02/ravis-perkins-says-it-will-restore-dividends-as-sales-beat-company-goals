             Travis Perkins Plc , the owner of
Wickes home-improvement stores, said it will resume the payment
of dividends after more than a one-year break following better-
than-expected sales in the first half.  
 Revenue climbed 4.7 percent, while comparable sales at
stores open at least a year rose 3.4 percent, the Northampton,
U.K.-based company said in a statement today. The company plans
to pay an interim dividend of 5 pence a share, barring
“unforeseen circumstances,” it said.  
 “Current trading continues to be ahead of management
expectations and we now have the confidence to contemplate
recommencing paying dividends,” Chief Executive Officer  Geoff Cooper  said in the statement.  
 Sales to professional builders drove growth, with
merchanting revenue 5.3 percent higher, Travis said. The company
said it expects to give an update on takeover talks with BSS
Group Plc “shortly.” BSS, the U.K.’s largest plumbing and
heating chain, said in May it would be prepared to accept Travis
Perkin’s preliminary 553 million-pound ($806 million) offer if
formally tabled.  
 By contrast, Travis Perkin’s sales at retail stores open at
least a year were little changed.
