             BP Plc’s first relief well aimed at
plugging its Gulf of Mexico gusher is seven to eight days ahead
of schedule to intercept and eventually plug the biggest oil
leak in U.S. history.  
 The target for intercepting the leaking well and pumping in
mud and cement to permanently seal it is still mid-August,
U.S. National Incident Commander Thad Allen said today on a
conference call with reporters. The well is within 600 feet
(182 meters) of intercepting the leak, Allen said.
