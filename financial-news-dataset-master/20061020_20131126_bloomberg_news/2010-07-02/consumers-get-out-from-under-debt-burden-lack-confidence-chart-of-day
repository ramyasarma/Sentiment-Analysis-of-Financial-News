             American consumers have reduced their
debt load so much that their reluctance to spend is mainly the
result of a lack of confidence, according to  Thomas J. Lee ,
chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a ratio of household
financial obligations to disposable income fell in the first
quarter to the lowest level in almost a decade, according to
data compiled by the Federal Reserve. This  indicator  reflects
payments on mortgages, home rentals, auto leases and consumer
debt, homeowners’ insurance and property taxes.  
 “Consumers are far less constrained today” than they were
during the past few years, Lee wrote yesterday in a report. The
first-quarter  ratio  was 17.4 percent, and he estimated that last
quarter’s figure dropped to 17.1 percent.  
 Readings exceeded 18 percent from 2005 through the second
quarter of last year. The gauge peaked at 18.9 percent in the
first three months of 2008.  
 The Conference Board’s  index  of consumer sentiment also
appears in the chart. Last month, the indicator dropped to 52.9
from a revised 62.7 in May, led by declines in the regions most
affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The earlier reading
was the  highest  since April 2008.  
 “The softness we are seeing in consumer spending is less
driven by constraints on income or debt capacity, but rather due
to weaker confidence,” Lee wrote. This means outlays are likely
to rebound as sentiment stabilizes, in his view.
