             LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA ,
the world’s largest luxury-goods maker, said it agreed to buy 70
percent of online fragrances and cosmetics retailer  Sack’s  to
take its Sephora beauty chain into Brazil.  
 Sack’s current management, led by co-founders Carlos Andre
Montenegro and Marcelo Franco, will remain in place, Paris-based
LVMH said today in a statement, without disclosing the price.  
 Sack’s, based in Rio de Janeiro, offers 270 brands and
serves more than 830,000 customers, according to the statement.
The 10-year-old online retailer gets 4 million individual Web
visits each month, making the e-commerce site one of the top
three most frequently accessed in Brazil, LVMH said.  
 First-quarter sales at LVMH’s selective retailing division,
which includes Sephora, rose 9 percent to 1.18 billion euros,
the luxury goods company reported  April 13 . Sephora gained
market share in all regions and will continue expanding its
retail network, LVMH said at the time.  
 LVMH rose 15 cents to 85.35 euros as of 9:42 a.m. in Paris
trading. The stock has gained 8.8 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 41.8 billion euros ($52.3 billion).
