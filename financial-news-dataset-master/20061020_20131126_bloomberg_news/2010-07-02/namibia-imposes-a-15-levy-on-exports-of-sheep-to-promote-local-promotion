             Namibia  imposed a 15 percent levy on
exports of live sheep to neighboring South Africa and said it
may double the tax to promote local slaughtering and processing
of the animals.  
 The rate may increase to 30 percent “depending on the trend
of exports,” Mbeuta Ua-Ndjarakana, permanent secretary in the
Information Ministry, said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday from Windhoek, the capital.  
 The levy was announced after a campaign to boost domestic
processing failed, Ua-Ndjarakana said. The so-called 6:1 program
sought to promote the export of one live animal for every six
slaughtered domestically.  
 “The 6:1 sheep-marketing scheme has been implemented but
has been found not to have yielded the desired impact,” Ua-
Ndjarakana said.  
 Livestock producers said government interference may damage
the industry, citing Meat Board statistics showing that sheep
production dropped to 800,000 in 2009 from 1 million in 2008.  
 “Many farmers in the traditional sheep farming areas are
switching to alternative activities such as cattle farming and
game farming,” the Livestock Producers Forum said in an e-mailed
statement today in Windhoek.
