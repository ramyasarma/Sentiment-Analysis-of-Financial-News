             Australian  stocks  rose, ending an
eight-day losing streak, after Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  reached an agreement with mining companies on a new
resources tax.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company,
climbed 1.7 percent and Rio Tinto Group, the third biggest,
gained 2.1 percent, as the deal ended a dispute that cost her
predecessor,  Kevin Rudd , his job.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. ,
Australia’s third-largest iron-ore miner, jumped 4 percent.
Santos Ltd., an oil and gas producer that said it welcomes the
agreement, rallied 1.6 percent.  
 Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  advanced 0.8 percent to
4,273.30 at 10:38 a.m. in Sydney, with materials, industrial and
energy stocks leading gains. The gauge has tumbled 11 percent
since the government’s original mining tax proposal was unveiled
on May 2.  
 The latest agreement “is a much more rational alternative
and should largely remove sovereign risk elements that have been
overhanging the Australian resources industry,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1.1 billion at Pengana
Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “It appears a sensible compromise.”  
 The mineral resources tax will be 30 percent, applying to
iron ore and coal, while the levy on oil and gas projects will
be 40 percent, the government said.  
 The government said the tax will only apply to the profits
of iron ore, coal, onshore petroleum and gas, representing
three-quarters of the value of exports, unlike the Rudd proposal
that also included most minerals extracted in Australia.
