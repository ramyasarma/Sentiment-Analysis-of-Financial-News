             U.S. and Cyprus officials don’t have
any information on the location of Christopher Metsos, the 54-
year-old Canadian who jumped bail two days ago to avoid
extradition on charges he was part a Russian espionage ring.  
 “The embassy has no information on the current whereabouts
of Mr. Metsos,” the U.S. embassy in the Cyprus capital Nicosia
said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Cypriot authorities don’t know if he is still on the
island, police spokesman Michalis Katsounotos said in a
telephone interview.  
 Metsos was arrested on June 29 at Cyprus’s main airport,
where he was trying to board a flight to Budapest. A court on
the eastern Mediterranean island released him on bail the same
day. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Metsos, a
purported Canadian citizen, was an agent of the Russian
espionage agency and traveled to the U.S. to pay other spies.  
 A New York woman also accused of belonging to the spy ring
was granted bail by a U.S. judge yesterday. The same judge
denied release to a married couple in the case because of doubt
about their true identities.  
 The cases are U.S. v. Metsos; U.S. v. Chapman, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
