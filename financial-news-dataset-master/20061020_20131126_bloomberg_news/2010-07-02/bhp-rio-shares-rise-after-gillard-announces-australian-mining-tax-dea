             BHP Billiton Ltd . and  Rio Tinto Group 
shares rose in Sydney trading today after negotiating a new
mining tax deal with the Australian government.  
 BHP, the world’s largest mining company, rose 1.7 percent
to A$37.75 at 10:28 a.m. Sydney time on the Australian stock
exchange. Rio rose 1.5 percent,  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd . was
up 3.5 percent, and Centennial Coal Co. increased 1.6 percent.  
 Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  reached a deal with mining
companies on the proposed tax, lowering the headline rate to 30
percent from 40 percent. BHP and Rio led a campaign against the
tax, which they said would stymie investment.  
 “The announcement removes a layer of uncertainty for the
sector,” said  Lucinda Chan , division director and head of Asian
business at Macquarie Private Wealth in Sydney.
