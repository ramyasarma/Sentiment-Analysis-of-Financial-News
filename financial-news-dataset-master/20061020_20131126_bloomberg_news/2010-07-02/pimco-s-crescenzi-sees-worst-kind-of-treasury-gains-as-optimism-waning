             The shrinking difference between
short- and long-term Treasury yields has been “the worst
kind” because it is driven by a pessimistic economic outlook,
according to Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the
world’s largest bond fund.  
 “The flattening of the yield curve has been the worst
kind,”  Anthony Crescenzi , a money manager at Newport Beach,
California-based Pimco, wrote to clients yesterday. It occurred
during “a decline in market interest rates on both ends of the
yield curve. Investors have become less optimistic about the
outlook for both the U.S. and global economy.”  
 The  spread , known as the yield curve, narrowed to 2.27
percentage points yesterday, the least since October. It has
tumbled from a record 2.94 percentage points set in February.  
 Treasuries returned 5.9 percent since the end of 2009,
their best first half in 15 years, indexes compiled by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch showed. A debt crisis in Europe, stock
declines around the world and slowing inflation bolstered
demand for the relative safety of government securities.  
 Nations will no longer be able to borrow to spur economic
growth, Crescenzi wrote.  
 “The last balance sheet has been tapped, forcing fiscal
austerity upon all levels of government worldwide and affecting
economic activity,” his report said. “Investors are
increasingly of the belief that the inflation rate could
continue to move lower.”  
 Flight to Safety  
 Investors sought the safest assets as European governments
struggled to cut their budgets, sending the region’s currency
to a four-year low last month. The MSCI World index of shares
fell 11 percent in the first half of the year.  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader
expectations for consumer prices, narrowed to 1.74 percentage
points yesterday, the least since October.  
 The record-size $234 billion Pimco Total Return  Fund 
gained 5.8 percent this year, beating 84 percent of its
competitors, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Pimco, based in Newport Beach, California, had $1.07
trillion  assets  under management as of March 31 and is a unit
of Munich-based insurer Allianz SE.
