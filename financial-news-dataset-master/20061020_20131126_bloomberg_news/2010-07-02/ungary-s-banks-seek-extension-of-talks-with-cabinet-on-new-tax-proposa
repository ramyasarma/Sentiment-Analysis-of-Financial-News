             Hungary’s bank association has asked
the government to extend talks on a proposed financial tax, said
Janos Muller, chief adviser to the association.  
 The banking group asked for an extension of negotiations on
behalf of the six largest foreign banks in Hungary, Muller said
in a phone interview in Budapest today.  
 Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said on June 30 that the
government wants to conclude talks on the levy in “days.” The
tax on financial institutions, intended to raise 200 billion
forint ($880 million) this year, is a key part of the
government’s plan to meet this year’s budget  deficit  target
approved by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union
and the World Bank.  
 Should the government heed lenders’ request, negotiations
on the tax could resume after the IMF’s official visit to
Hungary, which starts next week, Muller said.
