             Crude oil may fall next week as data
on manufacturing, jobless claims and home sales bolster concern
the U.S. economic recovery is faltering, a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  
 Twenty of 38 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through July 9. Ten respondents, or 26 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and eight saw an
increase. Last week an equal number of analysts forecast a gain
or drop.  
 Oil slipped yesterday after the Institute for Supply
Management’s  gauge  of manufacturing fell to 56.2 in June from
59.7 a month earlier. Other data showed contracts to buy
existing homes tumbled last month, and claims for jobless
benefits unexpectedly rose last week.  
 “We’ve had a series of progressively worse economic
numbers lately,” said  Peter Beutel , president of trading
advisory company Cameron Hanover Inc. in New Canaan,
Connecticut. “There’s a lot more talk of a double-dip
recession.”  
 First-time filings for jobless benefits rose 13,000 last
week to 472,000, the Labor Department said yesterday. The number
of contracts to purchase previously owned houses plunged 30
percent in May, more than twice as much as forecast, after a
homebuyer tax credit expired, according to the National
Association of Realtors.  
 Crude oil for August delivery has dropped $6.72, or 8.5
percent, to $72.14 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are down 9.1 percent so far this year.  
 The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 48 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  

 
     Bloomberg’s survey of oil analysts and traders, conducted
each Thursday, asks for an assessment of whether crude oil
futures are likely to rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming
week. The results were:

                    RISE      NEUTRAL    FALL
                     8          10        20
