             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, is to sell its Indian
commercial and retail unit to  HSBC Holdings Plc  for around $95
million as the bank shrinks its balance sheet.  
 The acquisition should be completed in the first half of
2011, HSBC said in a statement today. The unit has assets worth
$1.8 billion, about 1.1 million customers, 1,800 employees and
31 branches, according to the statement.  
 “The main focus of our strategy is on emerging markets and
this acquisition is our third transaction in one of the world’s
largest and fastest growing developing markets in the last two
years,” HSBC Chief Executive Officer  Michael Geoghegan  said in
the statement.  
 RBS CEO  Stephen Hester  is selling assets acquired by his
predecessor,  Fred Goodwin,  who spent $100 billion and expanded
the bank’s operations into more than 54 countries. The bank has
announced the sale of units in Argentina, Kazakhstan, Pakistan
and the United Arab Emirates in the past month.  
 HSBC’s purchase will add to the 2 million customers and
35,000 employees in its existing Indian unit. RBS will continue
to maintain an investment banking operations in India.  
 HSBC  was previously in talks to acquire RBS assets in
India, China and Malaysia, a person familiar with the situation
said last month. The discussions broke down last year following
objections from Indian regulators, the person said.
