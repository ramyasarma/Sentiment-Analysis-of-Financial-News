             Employment fell in June for the first
time this year, reflecting a drop in federal census workers as
the decennial population count began to wind down, economists
said before a report today.  
 Payrolls declined by 130,000 last month, according to the
median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Private employment, which excludes government jobs, rose for a
sixth consecutive month, the survey showed.  
 The pace of hiring signals it will take years for the
world’s largest economy to recover the more than 8 million jobs
lost during the recession that began in December 2007. The
turmoil in financial markets brought on by the European debt
crisis raises the risk that employment will slow, depriving
American households of the  income  needed to maintain spending.  
 “The recovery downshifted a gear in recent months,” said
 David Resler , chief economist at Nomura Securities International
Inc. in New York. Payroll gains will probably be “consistent
with moderate growth in income and spending.”  
 Figures from the Labor Department show the number of
workers helping  conduct the census  dropped by about 230,000 from
mid May to mid June, the period corresponding to the
government’s jobs survey. The decrease still left 344,000 people
on the census payroll, indicating more cuts to come that will
keep distorting the employment figures for months.  
 Private Payrolls  
 For that reason, economists say private payrolls, which
exclude government jobs, will be a better gauge of the state of
the labor market for much of 2010. Employment at companies rose
by 110,000 after a 41,000 gain in May, according to the median
forecast of 50 economists surveyed.  
 The report will also show the  unemployment  rate rose to 9.8
percent last month from 9.7 percent in May, according to the
survey. Joblessness, which reached a 26-year high of 10.1
percent in October, will take time to recede as the number of
previously discouraged jobseekers returning to the labor force
exceeds the number of available jobs.  
 Factory payrolls  increased in June for the sixth straight
month, according to the survey.  
 Those gains may slacken as the industry leading the U.S.
economic expansion cools. A report yesterday from the Tempe,
Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management showed
manufacturing  expanded  in June at the slowest pace of the year
as orders and exports decelerated.  
 Sales and inventories “are very much in sync,”  Samuel Allen , chief executive officer of Deere & Co., said in an
interview June 23, in a reference to the manufacturer’s
agricultural business. The Moline, Illinois-based company also
has started adding stockpiles on the construction side in recent
months, he said.  
 ‘Moving Slowly’  
 “We do believe the recovery is under way,” Allen said.
“We do believe it is moving slowly. We do believe it is on
stable ground at this time.”  
 Manufacturers have avoided the worst of the market turmoil.
The Standard & Poor’s  Supercomposite Industrial Machinery  Index
of 52 companies, including Caterpillar Inc. and Deere, has
decreased 0.1 percent so far this year compared with a 7.9
percent decline in the broader S&P 500.  
 President  Barack Obama , after meeting with Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  June 29, said the U.S. economy is
strengthening even as the European debt crisis has weakened
financial markets.  
 “We have seen some very positive trends in a number of
sectors,” Obama said at the White House after meeting with his
economic advisers. “Unfortunately, because of the troubles
we’ve seen in Europe, we’re now seeing some headwinds and
skittishness and nervousness on the part of the markets.”  
 November Elections  
 The economy, jobs and the budget deficit are likely to be
top issues in November elections that will decide control of
Congress. Heading into the campaign season, the administration
is facing public pessimism about the direction of the economy.  
 The Fed last month said slowing inflation and the fallout
from Europe’s debt crisis where among reasons it will maintain
interest rates low for “an extended period.”  
 Delta Air Lines Inc ., the world’s biggest carrier, is
starting to add staff. Atlanta-based Delta will hire 700 airport
ticket and gate agents to help handle increased summer traffic
and operations disrupted by weather, Chris Kelly, a Delta
spokeswoman, said June 18 in an interview. The new positions are
in addition to the 300 pilot and 300 reservation agent jobs
recently filled by the Atlanta-based airline.
