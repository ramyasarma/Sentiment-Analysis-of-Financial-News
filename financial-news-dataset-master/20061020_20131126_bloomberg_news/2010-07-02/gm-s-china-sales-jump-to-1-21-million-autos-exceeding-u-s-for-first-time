             General Motors Co’s first-half sales
in China surpassed those in the U.S. for the first time as the
world’s fastest-growing major economy propelled global auto
demand.  
 Sales in the first six months of 2010 rose 48.5 percent to
1.21 million units, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. June sales rose 23 percent to 176,486 units.
