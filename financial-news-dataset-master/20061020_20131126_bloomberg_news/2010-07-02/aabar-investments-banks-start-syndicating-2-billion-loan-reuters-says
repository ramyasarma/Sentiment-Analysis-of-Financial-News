             Aabar Investments PJSC , the Abu Dhabi
company that is the largest shareholder in  Daimler AG , began
syndicating a $2 billion loan, Reuters reported, citing bankers
close to the deal.  
 Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Abu
Dhabi and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are arranging the
financing, according to the report. The four banks, along with
Credit Suisse Group AG and Union National Bank, have partially
prefunded the deal, Reuters said.  
 The three-year financing includes a $1.4 billion term loan
and a $600 million revolving credit, both of which pay interest
at 150 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate,
according to the report. Money in a revolving credit can be
borrowed again once it’s been repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  
 A spokeswoman for Aabar Investments wasn’t available to
comment outside normal business hours.
