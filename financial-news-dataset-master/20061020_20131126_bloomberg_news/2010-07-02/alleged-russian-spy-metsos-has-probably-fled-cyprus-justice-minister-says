             Christopher Metsos, the 54-year-old
Canadian who jumped bail in Cyprus two days ago to avoid
extradition on charges he was part of a Russian espionage ring,
has probably left the island, the Cypriot justice minister said.  
 “In my opinion he must have left Cyprus,” Justice
Minister Loucas Louca said today in a telephone interview. “I
don’t know any more than this. We evaluate all information we
receive.”  
 Metsos was arrested on June 29 at Cyprus’s main airport,
where he was trying to board a flight to Budapest. A court on
the eastern Mediterranean island released him on bail the same
day and he disappeared the day after. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation said Metsos, a purported Canadian citizen, was an
agent of the Russian espionage agency and traveled to the U.S.
to pay other spies.  
 A New York woman also accused of belonging to the spy ring
was granted bail by a U.S. judge yesterday. The same judge
denied release to a married couple in the case because of doubt
about their true identities.  
 U.S. authorities arrested 10 people on June 28 for
allegedly spying for the Russian Federation, according to the
 Justice Department .  
 The cases are U.S. v. Metsos; U.S. v. Chapman, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
