             Cosan SA Industria & Comercio’s 
negotiations with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  for a fuel joint venture
in Brazil are “absolutely” on schedule, Cosan Chief Financial
Officer  Marcelo Martins  said.  
 The joint venture will absorb all of Cosan’s debt, Martins
said in an interview during an Economist conference in Paris
today. He said the Brazilian sugar producer will keep its
existing agreements with Exxon Mobil Corp.  
 Shell and Cosan, the world’s largest sugar-cane processor,
said in February they plan to combine ethanol, sugar and fuel
distribution assets in Brazil. Shell, Europe’s largest oil
producer by market value, agreed to pay $1.63 billion in cash
over two years and additional payments of $300 million in five
years depending on the venture’s earnings.  
 The two companies signed a non-binding agreement and have
until Aug. 1 to conclude the deal. Cosan said Feb. 1 that it
will transfer $2.52 billion of debt to the venture.  
 In 2008, Cosan acquired Exxon’s fuel-distribution assets in
Brazil for $826 million, including the rights to use the Esso
brand in the Latin American country.
