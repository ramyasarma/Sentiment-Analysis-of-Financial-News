             China won’t aim to accumulate large-
scale foreign-exchange reserves and long-term international
payment surpluses, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
said in a statement posted on its website today.  
 The dollar, euro and yen are major currencies in China’s
foreign-exchange reserves and the country will “dynamically”
adjust the proportion of currencies in the reserves, it said.
