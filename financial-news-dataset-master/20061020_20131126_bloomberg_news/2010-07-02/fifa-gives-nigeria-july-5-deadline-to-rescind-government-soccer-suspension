             FIFA gave Nigeria until July 5 to
rescind its withdrawal of the country’s national teams from
competition or face suspension from soccer’s governing body.  
 President Goodluck Jonathan said two days ago that Nigeria
won’t play international matches for two years after the
nation’s first-round exit at the World Cup in South Africa.  
 FIFA opposes government intervention in the affairs of
national soccer federations. Amos Adamu, a Nigerian member of
FIFA’s executive committee, will try a final mediation on
Monday, FIFA General Secretary  Jerome Valcke  said today.  
 “After Monday 6 p.m. if nothing has changed FIFA will
suspend them,” Valcke said in an e-mail.  
 According to FIFA’s statutes, member associations are
obliged “to manage their affairs independently and ensure that
their own affairs are not influenced by any third parties.”
