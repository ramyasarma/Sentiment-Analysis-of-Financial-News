             The Houston headquarters building of
indicted financier  R. Allen Stanford  was sold for $12.5 million
after an auction failed to attract multiple offers, said a
lawyer for his court-appointed receiver.  
 “We are about to file a motion to confirm the sale,”
 Kevin Sadler , the lead attorney for receiver  Ralph Janvey , said
yesterday in an e-mail.  
 Janvey posted a public notice that the 186,000-square-foot
office tower, located across the street from Houston’s upscale
Galleria shopping mall, would be sold in a sealed-bid auction on
June 24. The opening offer of $12.5 million was submitted as a
stalking-horse bid by Dirk Laukien, a Houston real estate
investor who agreed to pay cash for the property.  
 The building, valued on property tax rolls at $7.1 million,
has mahogany paneling, marble floors, open stairwells with
custom brass railings, a theater and a private entrance through
the black marble bathroom of Stanford’s executive suite.  
 Stanford, who denies all wrongdoing, has objected to the
receiver’s sale of his assets and properties before he’s been
convicted of anything. The founder of the Stanford Financial
Group of companies is in a federal prison in Houston awaiting
trial in January on 21 criminal charges that he swindled
investors of more than $7 billion through a scheme involving
certificates of deposit sold through his Antiguan bank.  
 Stanford faces parallel allegations in a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission lawsuit that gave control of his
personal and corporate assets to Janvey for liquidation to pay
creditors and investors.  
 The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09cr342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09cv298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas).
