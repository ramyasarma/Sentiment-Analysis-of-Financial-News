             World No. 1 Rafael Nadal took the
first set of his Wimbledon semifinal with Andy Murray.  
 Nadal won the first set 6-4, even after Murray had five
aces and the Spaniard had none. The winner of the match will
face Tomas Berdych, who defeated third-seeded Novak Djokovic in
straight sets to reach the final.
