             Portugal’s government may be able to
drag out the dispute over its veto of Portugal Telecom SGPS SA’s
sale of its stake in a Brazilian joint venture, Publico
reported, citing unidentified lawyers.  
 If the European Court of Justice’s July 8 ruling
invalidates the “golden share,” it will give Portugal some
time in which to eliminate the veto power, and the government
could take longer, though it may be fined, the newspaper said.  
 The government argues that, legally, it didn’t use a golden
share, but instead made use of powers that were previously
approved by Portugal Telecom shareholders and are included in
the company’s by-laws, the newspaper said.
