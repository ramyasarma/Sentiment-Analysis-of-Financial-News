             China, the world’s second-biggest
energy consumer, may post a 9 percent gain in monthly oil demand
in the second-half of 2010 from a year earlier as its reliance
on oil imports grow, China Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals said.  
 Monthly oil demand may reach 35.5 million metric tons,
China OGP, a newsletter published by the official Xinhua News
Agency, said in its latest issue without citing anyone. Monthly
oil output may rise 4.6 percent in the six-month period, lagging
behind the expansion in consumption, it said.  
 China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy, bought
from abroad more than half its crude needs in 2009 to feed its
expanding industries. The country may rely on oil imports to
satisfy 58 percent of requirements by 2015, China OGP said.  
 A surge in refinery output because of capacity expansions
will likely outpace China’s demand growth, causing the country
to remain a net exporter of gasoline and diesel for at least two
to three years, according to the newsletter.  
 China may add about 30 million tons of oil-refining
capacity this year, a 10 percent growth over a year earlier,
China OGP said. That exceeds the average 4 percent growth in
fuel demand seen in recent years, the report said.
