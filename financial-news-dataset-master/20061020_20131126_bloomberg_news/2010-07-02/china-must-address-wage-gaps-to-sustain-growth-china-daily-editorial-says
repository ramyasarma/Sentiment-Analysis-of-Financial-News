             The increase in minimum wages in
Chinese provinces and cities must be followed by other measures
to boost personal incomes as a share of gross domestic product
to sustain growth in consumption, the China Daily said today in
an editorial.  
 Personal incomes as a proportion of GDP have declined
during most of the past 30 years and an increase in the minimum
wage alone is unlikely to narrow the disparity, the editorial
said today.  
          
          


  
     
       
     
           
                           
                 
                 
                                       
                                   
               
                        
           
                          July 1 (Bloomberg) -- Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group, talks with Bloomberg's Linzie Janis about the threat of inflation in China and its potential impact on cost of living expenses.
