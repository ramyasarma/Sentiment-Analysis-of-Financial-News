             U.S. stock-index futures drifted
between gains and losses as investors speculated about the
strength of the economic recovery before a report that may show
employment fell in June for the first time this year.  
 McDonald’s Corp., the world’s largest restaurant company,
rose 0.6 percent in European trading. Exxon Mobil Corp. gained
1.1 percent. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. declined 0.5 percent.  
 Futures  on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  expiring in
September gained 0.2 percent to 1,022.5 at 7:37 a.m. in New
York.  Dow Jones Industrial Average  futures rose 0.1 percent to
9,674, while Nasdaq-100 Index futures increased 0.3 percent to
1,733.5.  
 U.S. stocks fell yesterday for the eighth day in nine,
tumbling to a nine-month low, as weaker-than-estimated data on
manufacturing and home sales fueled concern that the recovery is
in peril. The S&P 500 tumbled 12 percent in the second quarter
to the cheapest level in more than a year on concern a
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and China’s moves to slow the
world’s largest emerging economy will dent global growth.  
 “There has been a major shift in sentiment and there are a
lot of questions out there unnerving investors,” said  Jonathan Plant  at Liberum Capital ltd. in London. “Do we enter a double-
dip recession? Can earnings hold up? Can a jobless recovery be
sustained? There is going to be a lot of focus on today’s
report, particularly on job creation in the private sector.”  
 Payrolls Report  
 Employment in the U.S. fell in June for the first time
since December, reflecting a drop in federal census workers as
the decennial population count began to wind down, economists
said before today’s report.  
 Payrolls declined by 130,000 last month, according to the
median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
Labor Department release, which follows a disappointing report
on hiring from ADP Employer Services on June 30, is due at 8:30
a.m. New York time.  
 The  S&P 500  closed yesterday at 12.6 times projected
profits for its companies, according to Bloomberg data, its
cheapest valuation since March 2009, when the gauge began an 80
percent rally.  
 McDonald’s  advanced 0.8 percent to $67.23 in Germany. Exxon
Mobil, the biggest oil company, gained 0.9 percent to $57.13.
Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, dropped 0.5 percent to
$48.12.  
 Dell Inc. gained 0.5 percent to $12.09. The world’s third-
largest personal-computer maker agreed to buy Scalent Systems
Inc., a maker of software for managing server computers, as it
pushes to expand sales of data-center products.  
 Blockbuster Inc.  may be active. The money-losing video-
rental chain said the New York Stock Exchange informed the
company it will begin the process of delisting its common stock.
Shareholders rejected a proposal for a reverse split of the
shares needed to boost the price and comply with the exchange’s
listing requirements. The shares didn’t trade in Europe.
