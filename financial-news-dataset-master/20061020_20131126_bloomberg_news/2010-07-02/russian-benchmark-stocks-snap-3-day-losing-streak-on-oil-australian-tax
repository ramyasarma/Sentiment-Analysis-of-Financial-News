             Russian stocks advanced for the first
time in four days after oil rebounded and mining stocks gained
on Australia’s compromise tax agreement with resource companies.  
 The country’s two largest oil producers  OAO Rosneft  and  OAO
Lukoil  both increased more than 1 percent.  OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel , the nation’s biggest miner, gained 1.7 percent, helping
to push the  Micex Index  of 30 stocks higher by 1 percent at
1,267.35 as of 11:22 a.m. in Moscow, paring the weekly loss to 6
percent.  
 Crude, Russia’s chief export, rose as much as 43 cents to
$73.68 a barrel in New York after slipping 6.8 percent in the
previous four days. A compromise agreement between the
Australian government and mining companies on changes to a
proposed resources tax relieved concern that the levy would
crimp earnings at mining companies and smother economic growth,
boosting demand for riskier investments.  
 “The market was oversold yesterday and we are seeing fund
managers stepping in looking for some bargains,”  Elena Suslova ,
portfolio manager at Wermuth Asset Management, which manages
about $400 million in Russia and eastern Europe, said by phone.
The Australian tax is “positive for metals and mining which
have been amongst the worst affected in the sell-off,” she
said.  
 Russian stocks retreated yesterday to their lowest level in
five weeks as oil plunged after reports showed manufacturing in
China and the U.S. slowed in June, indicating the world’s two
largest energy consumers may need less crude. The Micex has slid
17 percent from its April 15 peak.
