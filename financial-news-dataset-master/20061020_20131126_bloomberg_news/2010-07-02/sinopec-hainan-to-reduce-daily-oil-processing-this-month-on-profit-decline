             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , the
nation’s largest oil refiner, will cut daily oil processing
volume at its Hainan plant by 11 percent this month from June as
profit shrinks, a refinery official said.  
 The refinery plans to process 720,000 metric tons of crude
this month, or about 170,000 barrels a day, from 780,000 tons in
June, said the official, who declined to be identified because
of company rules.  
 The plant is making “little” profit from crude processing
after the government reduced oil-product prices in June, he said.
The refinery has a designed capacity of 8 million tons a year.  
 China cut gasoline and diesel prices by about 3 percent
starting June 1 after a drop in crude oil prices.
