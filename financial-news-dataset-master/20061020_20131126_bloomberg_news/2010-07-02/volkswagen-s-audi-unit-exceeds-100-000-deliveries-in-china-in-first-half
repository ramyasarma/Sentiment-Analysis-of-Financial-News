             Volkswagen AG’s Audi unit exceeded
100,000 deliveries in China over a six-month period for the
first time.  
 Deliveries reached 109,887 in the first half of the year, a
64 percent increase on the year earlier, the Ingolstadt,
Germany-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Audi
expects to pass a targeted 200,000 mark earlier than expected,
it said.
