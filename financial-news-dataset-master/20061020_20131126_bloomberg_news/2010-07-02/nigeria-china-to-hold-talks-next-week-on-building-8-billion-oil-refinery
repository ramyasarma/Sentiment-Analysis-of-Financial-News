             Nigeria  and China may sign an accord
on the construction of an $8 billion oil refinery in the West
African nation after talks next week, the state-owned oil
company said.  
 A 13-man Chinese delegation is due in Nigeria on July 5 for
talks about the facility, said Adebayo Ibirogba, general manager
of Greenfield Refineries at the state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. The proposed refinery will have the capacity to
process 300,000 barrels of oil per day.  
 “Although the talks have been exploratory for now, we’re
positive a deal can be signed after further discussions with the
Chinese who will be in the country by Monday,” Ibirogba said in
an interview today from the capital, Abuja.  
 Nigeria and China in May agreed to $23 billion of funding
to build three new oil refineries and a petrochemical complex in
the West African nation. The construction of the facilities is
aimed at helping the country produce the estimated 750,000
barrels of oil per day it will need over the next decade to curb
imports of refined petroleum products.  
 The proposed refineries will be built in Nigeria’s Lagos,
Kogi and Bayelsa states. Ibirogba didn’t say which state the $8
billion refinery would be built in.  
 Nigeria’s four existing refineries have a combined capacity
of 445,000 barrels per day, though they are unable to operate at
full production because of ageing equipment and poor
maintenance. That has forced Nigeria to depend on imports to
meet its refined-fuel requirements.
