             Treasuries fluctuated as stocks swung
between losses and gains after the U.S. payrolls report showed
the nation lost fewer jobs last month than analysts forecast.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year notes over
2-year debt increased for the first time in five days on reduced
deflation concern as private employers added positions for a
sixth month. The two-year note  yield  touched a record low
earlier this week on speculation the U.S. recovery is stalling.  
 “We have reached an area where we have priced in a lot of
the bad news,” said  David Ader , head of government bond
strategy in Stamford, Connecticut, at CRT Capital Group LLC.
“For the moment, maybe you should look for other entry points
for buying.”  
 The  yield  on the 10-year note increased three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.98 percent at 4:15 p.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.5
percent security maturing in May 2020 dropped 7/32, or $2.19 per
$1,000 face amount, to 104 14/32.  
 U.S. payrolls decreased by 125,000 last month as the
government cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010
census, Labor Department figures showed today. The median
forecast of 82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
reduction of 130,000.  
 Employment at companies rose 83,000 following an increase
of 33,000 in the previous month. The unemployment rate dropped
to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent.  
 ‘Fears Weren’t Realized’  
 “The fears weren’t realized,” said William O’Donnell,
managing director in Stamford, Connecticut, at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc, one of the 18 primary dealers that trade directly
with the Federal Reserve. “It’s way too premature to say we’re
headed to another double dip.”  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.5 percent, extending
its weekly drop to 5 percent, after earlier rising 0.5 percent.  
 The 10-year note’s  yield  decreased 14 basis points this
week after touching 2.8793 percent yesterday, the lowest level
since April 28, 2009. The two-year note yield fell 3 basis
points to 0.62 percent after sliding on June 30 to 0.5856
percent, the all-time low.  
 The difference between 10- and 2-year note debt, known as
the yield curve, advanced to 2.35 percentage points after
touching 2.28 percentage points yesterday, the lowest level
since Oct. 2.  
 The yield curve flattened yesterday after the Labor
Department reported that initial  jobless claims  unexpectedly
climbed to 472,000 in the week ended June 26 from a revised
459,000 in the previous week.  
 Yield Spread  
 The narrowing spread indicated investor preference for
longer-term bonds, which tend to rise on slowing inflation. Two-
year rates tend to track the outlook for the Fed’s target rate
for overnight lending.  
 U.S. debt returned 5.9 percent in the first six months of
2010, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 7.6 percent during that period.  
 Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said the June employment
report indicates “very slow economic and job growth going
forward.”  
 “I don’t think the Federal Reserve can raise interest
rates in the face of unemployment near 10 percent,” Gross,
Newport Beach, California-based Pimco’s co-chief investment
officer, said during a radio interview with  Tom Keene  on
Bloomberg Surveillance.  
 Fed Rate View  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange showed a 17 percent
chance of the Fed raising its target lending rate for overnight
lending between banks by at least a quarter-percentage point by
the December meeting, compared with 36 percent odds a month ago.  
 The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of the inflation outlook
known as the break-even rate, has narrowed 0.17 percentage point
this week to 1.78 percentage point after reaching the 2010 high
of 2.49 percentage points on Jan. 11.  
 The consumer price index dropped 0.2 percent in May in the
biggest decrease since December 2008, the Labor Department
reported June 17.  
 Treasury 10-year notes will “retest the lows in yields we
had in 2008,”  David Rosenberg , chief economist at Gluskin Sheff
& Associates Inc. in Toronto, said on Bloomberg Surveillance.
“There’s more room for inflation expectations to come down,”
he said after the payrolls report.  
 The 10-year note yield will climb to 3.70 percent by year-
end, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of banks and securities companies, with the most recent
estimates given the heaviest weightings. The yield reached its
record low of 2.0352 percent on Dec. 18, 2008.
