             BP Plc  posted its first weekly gain
since the Gulf of Mexico leak began after relief wells to stop
the worst oil spill in U.S. history progressed ahead of
schedule.  
 The shares closed at 322 pence in London, 5.7 percent
higher than a week ago and the biggest five-day jump since
March. The stock is still down 51 percent since the April 20
blowout on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 and
triggered the spill.  
 The first intercept well is ahead of schedule and about 600
feet from the damaged well, U.S. National Incident Commander
 Thad Allen  said yesterday. The cleanup effort dodged a direct
hit from Hurricane Alex this week, and BP last month pledged a
$20 billion fund for damages, paid for by canceling three
quarters of dividends, asset sales and lower investment.  
 “The market had gone to an extreme level of emotion,”
said  Christopher Wheaton , who manages about $400 million of
securities at Allianz RCM’s Energy Fund in London, including BP
shares. “There was concern the relief wells wouldn’t work, but
now it’s clear BP will be able to cap this and cut off the most
extreme tail risk. We’re beyond the turning point.”  
 The relief well is designed to drill into the leaking
Macondo well and pump in mud and cement to permanently seal it.
While the company said earlier this week that it’s sticking to
its schedule for an August completion, Allen said at a White
House briefing yesterday that “I’d rather under-promise and
over-deliver” on the timetable.  
 Takeover Talk  
 The drop in BP shares since the accident has wiped 60
billion pounds ($91 billion) off the company’s market value,
prompting JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. analyst  Fred Lucas  to say this
week that rivals Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc may
consider bidding for the company.  
 BP collected a total of 25,150 barrels of oil yesterday.
The government estimates the well may be leaking as much as
60,000 barrels a day, and BP is working on upgrading its
containment system to increase its capacity before the relief
wells are finished.  
 Swells of up to 10 feet from the hurricane forced a
suspension of skimming and booming operations. The rough seas
prevented work by a relief ship designed to suck up 25,000
barrels a day of oil. The ship won’t be able to start working
until at least July 7.  
 The relief wells were scheduled to take three months to
complete after drilling began in May.  Iain Conn , head of
refining and marketing at BP and a member of its board, said in
an interview June 29 that the company is making “good
progress” on the wells.  
 “This process slows the closer you get because we’re
ranging, finding the well, drilling ahead, checking, and
drilling again,” Conn said. “It’ll take time and we want to
get it right.”
