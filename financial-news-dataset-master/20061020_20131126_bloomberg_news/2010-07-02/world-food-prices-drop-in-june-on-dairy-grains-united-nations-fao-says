             World food prices dropped in June
from the previous month as falling costs for dairy and cereals
more than compensated for higher sugar prices, the United
Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization said.  
 The FAO’s  index of 55 foods  dropped to 162.6 points from
164.2 points in May, the Rome-based UN agency said in a  report 
on its website today. The indicator fell to the lowest level
since October.  
 The dairy-price index fell to 203.1 points from 209.2 and
the cereals index dropped to 151.7 points from 155.2, the
lowest level for the grain-price gauge since May 2007,
according to the report.  
 Sugar prices increased, and the index for costs of the
sweetener climbed to 224 points from 215.7 points, the lowest
since April 2009.  
 The meat-price index was little changed at 136.4 points,
while the oils index slipped to 168.4 points from 170.4, the
report showed. The basis for the FAO index is 2002 to 2004.
