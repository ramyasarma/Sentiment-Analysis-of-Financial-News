             Genting Malaysia Bhd. , the country’s
sole casino operator, tumbled the most in five weeks on concern
it’s paying too much for the U.K. gaming businesses of its
parent company’s Singapore unit.  
 The stock  fell  4.4 percent to close at 2.62 ringgit in
Kuala Lumpur trading, its biggest drop since May 26. It slumped
as much as 10 percent earlier, the most in almost nine years.
It’s the worst performer on the benchmark  FTSE Bursa Malaysia
KLCI Index  today.  
 The acquisition is “expensive for a risky market,”  Yee Mei Hui , an analyst at HwangDBS Vickers Research Sdn., said in a
report today, where he downgraded the stock to “fully valued”
from “buy.” “Genting Malaysia may be better off investing in
strong growth potential markets or return capital to
shareholders.”  
 The proposed acquisition prompted a wave of  downgrades  from
brokerages including OSK Research Sdn., which cut the stock to
“sell” from “buy” and called the transaction “value
destructive.” Genting Singapore has written down the value of
the U.K. investment by the about 1.1 billion ringgit, OSK
analyst  Keith Wee  said in a report today.  
 ECM Libra Capital Sdn. and Affin Securities also told
investors to cut their holdings from an earlier recommendation
to buy, while AmResearch Sdn. downgraded the stock to “hold”
from “buy,” they said in reports today.  
 Expanding Overseas  
 Genting Malaysia  said yesterday it will buy the U.K. casino
businesses of  Genting Singapore Plc  for 340 million pounds ($509
million) to expand overseas. Genting Singapore bought Stanley
Leisure Plc in 2006, becoming the biggest gaming operator in the
U.K. with 44 venues under the Circus, Maxims and Mint brands.
Both companies are controlled by  Genting Bhd. , with businesses
ranging from casinos, power producers to palm-oil plantations.  
 Genting Singapore, which opened its $4.7 billion Resorts
World Sentosa development in the city-state’s Sentosa Island in
February, fell 1.7 percent to S$1.16 in Singapore, the most
since June 4. It earlier rose as much as 2.5 percent.  
 The sale is positive for Genting Singapore as “it is hard
to see how the U.K. operations can significantly grow
profitability,”  Edward Ong , a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  
 The acquisition cost values the transaction at 11.2 times
2011 earnings, which is 76 percent higher than its larger peer
Rank Group Plc, OSK’s Wee said. Genting Malaysia’s cash holdings
will shrink to 4 billion ringgit from 5.7 billion ringgit, he
said.  
 “The risk premium has increased” for Genting Malaysia,
Wee said. The “relatively high acquisition” costs are “not
compensated by meaningful earnings accretion to the group,” he
said.
