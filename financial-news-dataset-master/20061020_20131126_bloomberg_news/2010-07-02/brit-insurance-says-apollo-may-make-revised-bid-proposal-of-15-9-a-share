             Brit Insurance Holdings NV , a Lloyd’s
of London insurer, rejected an increased offer of 824 million
pounds ($1.25 billion) from Apollo Global Management, saying a
higher bid would be needed for it to begin talks.  
 Leon Black ’s private equity firm told Brit it may offer
10.50 pounds a share in cash, the insurer said in a statement
today. Amsterdam-based Brit rejected a bid of 10 pounds a share,
or 785 million pounds, from Apollo on June 11.  
 “The board remains open to engaging if Apollo were to put
forward an offer capable of recommendation,” Brit said in
today’s statement. “An offer at this level undervalues the
company and, accordingly, would not represent a basis on which
the board is prepared to engage with Apollo.”  
 A spokesman for Apollo in New York declined to comment
today.  
 Brit shares had  declined  7.5 percent this year before
Apollo made its first offer. The insurer was hit by higher-than-
expected claims from the Chilean earthquake in February. Private
equity firms such as Apollo are resuming their takeovers as the
credit crisis thaws, allowing banks to finance leveraged
buyouts. The firms have led $58 billion of takeovers this year,
an 81 percent increase on the year-earlier period, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Collins Stewart analyst  Ben Cohen , who cut Brit’s
recommendation to “hold” from “buy” after the statement,
said he was “surprised and disappointed that Brit’s board does
not consider 10.50 pounds a reasonable basis for discussions.  
 “We think there is a real risk now that Apollo walks
away.”  
 The insurer’s  shares  climbed 1.4 percent to 900 pence in
London for a market value of 706.4 million pounds.
