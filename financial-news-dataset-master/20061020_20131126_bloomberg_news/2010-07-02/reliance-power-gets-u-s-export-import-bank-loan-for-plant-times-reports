             Reliance Power Ltd. got approval for
a $600 million loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for a power
project in India’s Madhya Pradesh state, the Economic Times
reported, citing a letter written by the bank’s Chairman Fred
Hochberg. The loan is conditional on Reliance Power investing in
the renewable energy sector, according to the report.  
 Reliance Power’s request for the loan to build the coal-
fired power plant was rejected by Export-Import Bank’s board,
the lender’s spokeswoman Stephanie O’Keefe said June 25.
