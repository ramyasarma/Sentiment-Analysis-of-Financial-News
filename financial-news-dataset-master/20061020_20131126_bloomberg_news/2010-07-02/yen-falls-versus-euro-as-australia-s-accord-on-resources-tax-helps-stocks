             The yen fell against the Australian
dollar before the U.S. payrolls report as the South Pacific
nation’s government reduced a proposed tax on mining companies,
spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 The dollar traded near a seven-month low versus the yen as
economists forecast that the U.S. lost jobs in June. Australia’s
currency advanced against the greenback and yen on eased concern
the tax would pare earnings for miners and slow economic growth.  
 “The mining tax announcement offered respite for high-
yielding currencies and weighed on the yen,” said  Neil Mellor ,
a strategist at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. in London.  
 The yen depreciated 0.2 percent to 74.04 against the
Australian dollar at noon in London, from 73.88 yesterday. The
yen was little changed at 109.64 versus the euro, compared with
109.74, after reaching 107.32 on June 29, the strongest level
since November 2001. The dollar was at 87.69 yen, compared with
87.60, after reaching 86.97 yesterday, the lowest level since
Dec. 2. The euro dropped 0.1 percent to $1.2511, from $1.2527,
paring its gain this week to 1.2 percent.  
 U.S. employers cut 130,000 jobs in June, according to
the median forecast of 82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
A lower-than-expected 431,000 new jobs in May included a 411,000
jump in government hiring of temporary workers for the 2010
census, the Labor Department said June 4. The payrolls
report is due at 8:30 a.m. New York time.  
 Initial jobless claims climbed to 472,000 in the week ended
June 26 from a revised 459,000 in the previous week, the Labor
Department reported yesterday. The median forecast of 46
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a decrease to
455,000 from a previously reported 457,000.  
 ‘Further Losses’  
 “Some see weak U.S. data as putting a drag on dollar
demand,” analysts led by  Marc Chandler , global head of currency
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, wrote in
a research note today. The dollar’s weakening below $1.25 per
euro earlier this week “points to further losses ahead,”
according to Chandler.  
 The Aussie rose for a second day versus the greenback,
advancing 0.2 percent to 84.50 U.S. cents as Australian Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  scaled back a proposed tax on mining
companies to win their support.  
 The government exempted most commodities, raised the
threshold and cut the tax to 30 percent on coal and iron ore
earnings, compared with a previous plan to collect 40 percent of
all resource profits.  
 “The mining tax agreement is obviously a positive for
Australia,” said  Tony Allen , head of currency trading at ANZ
National Bank Ltd. in Wellington, New Zealand. “The Aussie and
kiwi will be focused on the bigger number, which is non-farm
payrolls, and how that plays out will dictate their performance
from here.”  
 Target Lending Rates  
 Benchmark interest rates are 4.5 percent in  Australia  and
2.75 percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in  Japan 
and as low as zero in the U.S., attracting investors to the
South Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such
trades is that currency market moves will erase profits.  
 The euro depreciated against the dollar after rising as
much as 2.5 percent yesterday, the most on an intraday day basis
since May 10.  
 “It’s come up too fast,” said  Adam Carr , a senior
economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “So, we’ll see the
euro drop back a little bit lower.”  
 The single currency may strengthen in the near term against
the dollar as bond yields advance, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  
 “We remain bearish longer term, but it is time to be
tactically square against the dollar, and possibly long for more
aggressive short-term trading purposes,”  Greg Gibbs , an RBS
strategist in Sydney, wrote today in a report.
