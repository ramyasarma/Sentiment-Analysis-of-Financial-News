             Colombian coffee prices may
“stabilize” at current levels after surging 25 percent this
year, buoyed by global demand, said  Rafael Mejia , president of
the Colombian Agriculture Society.  
 The price of coffee exports from the South American nation
rose this year to $2.39 a pound yesterday, a premium of about 75
cents over New York-traded futures, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Output will rise “little by little” as Colombian
producers replace aging trees, Mejia, whose group represents
growers of coffee and other crops, said today in an interview in
Bogota.  
 The harvest in Colombia, the biggest producer of arabica
beans after Brazil, hasn’t recovered this year since slumping to
a 33-year low in 2009. Colombian farmers harvested about 4.2
million bags in the first six months of the year, compared with
4.24 million bags in 2009, the National Coffee Growers
Federation said this week.
