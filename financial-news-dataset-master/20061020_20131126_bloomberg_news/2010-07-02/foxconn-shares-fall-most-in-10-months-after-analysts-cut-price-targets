             Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. ,
the world’s biggest contract maker of mobile phones, fell to its
lowest in almost 10 months in Hong Kong after at least three
analysts cut their share-price estimates.  
 Foxconn dropped 4.5 percent to close at HK$4.88, its lowest
since Sept. 7, after slumping as much as 6.9 percent. The  Hang
Seng Index  fell 1.1 percent.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  yesterday cut its target for the
company’s shares 25 percent to HK$3.9, while  Citigroup Inc. 
lowered its target price to HK$4.1 from HK$5.4 and  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  cut it to HK$4 from HK$5.4.  
 Shares  of the company, which supplies  Nokia Oyj  and
 Motorola Inc. , have fallen 46 percent this year, compared with a
9 percent drop in the Hang Seng.  
 Foxconn’s first-half  loss  will probably widen in part
because of lower prices for its products, according to a
statement filed to the Hong Kong stock exchange on June 29. The
city’s financial markets were closed yesterday.  
 Goldman, Citigroup and JPMorgan maintained their sell
recommendations on Shenzhen, southern China-based Foxconn.
