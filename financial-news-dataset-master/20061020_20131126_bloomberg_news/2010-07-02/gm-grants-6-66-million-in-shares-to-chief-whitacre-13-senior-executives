             General Motors Co., the largest U.S.
automaker, gave stock valued at $6.66 million to 14 top
managers, including $1.33 million worth to Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Ed Whitacre .  
 The 123,347 shares were valued at $53.98 each, a price
determined by a third party, the company said today in filings
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 GM gives executives salary stock units and restricted
shares to augment their compensation, which is constrained by
government rules because the automaker is 61 percent owned by
the U.S. Treasury Department. The company must disclose the
shares it grants in filings every quarter.  
 The company’s equity should be worth $70 billion, according
to a May 20 report by  Eric Selle , a JPMorgan Chase & Co. debt
analyst who projects a return of 47 cents on the dollar for
holders of bonds issued by GM’s predecessor, General Motors
Corp., that will be converted to stock and warrants in new GM.  
 GM’s implied equity value is about $47 billion at today’s
bond prices. Assuming 500 million shares, that would equate to
about $94 a share. At that price, the shares granted today would
be worth a total of $11.6 million.  
 Whitacre, whose stock would be worth about $2.31 million
based on GM’s bonds, also receives a $1.7 million annual cash
salary.  
 Chief Financial Officer  Chris Liddell  was awarded 15,979
shares worth about $862,500 under GM’s valuation and $1.5
million at market rates. Liddell receives a base salary of
$750,000 a year.  
 Some executives sold shares back to the Detroit-based
company. Managers sold 7,924 shares for a total of about
$427,700, according to the filings. Vice Chairman  Tom Stephens 
sold the most, 1,460 shares for about $78,800. Whitacre and
Liddell didn’t sell shares.
