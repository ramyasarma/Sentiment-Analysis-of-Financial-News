             Iran’s government-owned  Bank Melli 
will expand its network of women-only branches to all of the
country’s provincial capitals.  
 “In these branches, the aim is not sex segregation but
respect for women,” the state-run  Fars  news agency today cited
the bank’s director, Mahmoud-Reza Khavari, as saying. The
outlets will be managed and staffed solely by women.  
 Bank Melli opened Iran’s first women-only bank branch in
Mashhad on June 7, saying it wanted to help preserve their
“virtue.” Another branch will soon open in the central city of
Isfahan, and the bank will have outlets for women in the
capitals of all 30 provinces by the end of the current Iranian
year on March 20, Khavari said.  
 Iran has set aside $1.5 billion to promote “moral
conduct,” including enforcement of its dress code for women,
“to solve the cultural and social ills” in society, Interior
Minister  Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar  said on May 10. His comments
followed the introduction of a code of conduct at Shiraz
University of Medical Sciences that bans loud laughter, nail
polish, high heels and immodest clothing for women and men.  
 Since the revolution that brought Shiite Muslim religious
leaders to power three decades ago, women in Iran have been
required to cover their hair with scarves, obscure the shape of
the body with loose-fitting coats, and are segregated from men
in some public places, including Tehran’s buses.
