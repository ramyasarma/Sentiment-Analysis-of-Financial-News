             Tomas Berdych is leading third-seeded
Novak Djokovic two sets to love in their Wimbledon semifinal.  
 The 24-year-old from the Czech Republic took the first set
6-3 over Djokovic, 23, in 33 minutes. He took the second set  7-
6 (11-9) when the Serb doubled faulted.  
 In the second, the pair held serve until 5-5, when Berdych
got three break points. Djokovic got one back, but missed an
overhead smash to give the game to Berdych. He then broke back
in the next game with a sliding forehand.  
 In the tiebreaker, Djokovic was down 5-2, and went for a
big second serve, and missed. Berdych wasn’t able to take either
of his serves, making it 6-5. After a 21-shot rally, Djokovic’s
defense lob was ruled out, but the call was overturned. The Serb
won the replay to even the tiebreaker, and then the players
traded set points. Djokovic doublefaulted to lose the set,
hitting his chair with his racket and getting a warning from the
umpire.
