             Gold climbed from a five-week low on
demand for a store of value amid economic concerns in the U.S.
and Europe.  
 U.S. employment fell in June for the first time this year,
signaling a sluggish job-market recovery. Europe risks falling
back into recession as nations such as Germany and the U.K. cut
budgets sooner than expected, said Pacific Investment Management
Co., which runs the world’s largest bond fund.  
 “People are still considering gold as a safe haven,” said
 Bernard Sin , the head of currency and metal trading at bullion
refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva. “Europe is still not in a
good shape, and the U.S. is still not in a good shape.”  
 Gold for immediate delivery rose $11.90, or 1 percent, to
$1,210.55 an ounce at 3:24 p.m. New York time. Yesterday, the
price touched $1,196.65, the lowest level since May 25. The
metal headed for the second straight weekly decline.  
 The price climbed to a record last month as the euro
slumped on sovereign-debt concerns. Gold has advanced 10 percent
in 2010 following gains in the past nine years.  
 The metal is “a good hedge against further problems in the
financial field and further potential inflationary trends that
will be coming,”  Barry James , who manages $2 billion as chief
executive officer at James Investment Research Inc. in Xenia,
Ohio, said yesterday.  
 In June, gold also surged to all-time high in euros, U.K.
pound and Swiss francs.  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $1, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,207.70 on the Comex in New York. The metal touched $1,196
yesterday after the close of floor trading. The price dropped
3.9 percent this week.

 Platinum and palladium, used in pollution-control devices
in cars, slumped for the fifth straight day in tandem with
industrial metals.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell $3.2, or 0.2
percent, to $1,503.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The drop this week marked the longest slump since
early December. The metal dropped 4.5 percent since June 25.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery declined $2.15, or
0.5 percent, at $426.90 an ounce. This week, the metal tumbled
11 percent.  
 Silver futures for September delivery dropped 7.1 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $17.719 an ounce on the Comex. This week, the
commodity tumbled 7.5 percent, the most since mid-May.
