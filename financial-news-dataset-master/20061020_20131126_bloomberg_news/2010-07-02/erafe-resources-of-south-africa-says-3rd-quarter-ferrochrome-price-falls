             Merafe Resources Ltd. , part owner of
the world’s largest ferrochrome producer, said prices of the
steelmaking ingredient in Europe were settled 4 percent lower
for the third quarter.  
 The European benchmark ferrochrome price for the three
months through September was set at $1.30 a pound, compared with
$1.36 the previous quarter, the Johannesburg-based company said
in a statement today. Contract prices are fixed every three
months after talks between producers and customers.  
 Merafe’s venture with Zug, Switzerland-based  Xstrata Plc  is
the world’s largest producer of ferrochrome, which is used to
prevent corrosion in stainless steel.  
 Citigroup Inc. said on June 18 that ferrochrome prices may
slip in the third quarter as stainless steel production rates
slow.  Posco , Asia’s third-biggest steelmaker, said on June 28 it
will cut domestic prices for a second month to boost demand.  
 European domestic stainless steel prices fell 7.4 percent
in June, the first monthly decline so far this year, according
to data compiled by Metal Bulletin.  
 Shares in Merafe gained 8 cents, or 6.8 percent, to 12.5
rand as of 9:53 a.m. in Johannesburg, extending the climb during
the last 12 months to 25 percent.
