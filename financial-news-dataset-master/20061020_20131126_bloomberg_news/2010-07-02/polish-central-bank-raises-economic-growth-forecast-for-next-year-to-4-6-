             Poland’s central bank raised its
economic growth forecast for next year to 4.6 percent from a
February estimate of 2.9 percent.  
 Output will rise 3.2 percent this year, compared with an
earlier forecast of 3.1 percent, the bank said in its GDP and
Inflation Projection sent by e-mail today. Consumer demand,
imports and investments will drive growth next year, it said.  
 Policy makers this week left the  seven-day reference rate 
at a record-low 3.5 percent for a 12th month. For the first
time, the bank is looking at “ new factors that can increase
inflationary pressure,” Governor  Marek Belka  said on June 30,
indicating the bank may consider raising borrowing costs.  
 Inflation  will overshoot the bank’s target of 2.5 percent
and accelerate to 2.7 percent next year, compared with a 2.4
percent forecast in February.  
 A more volatile zloty may weigh on inflation, Belka said.
The currency has shed almost 7 percent since April 9, when the
bank bought foreign currency to bring down from a 16-month high.
A weaker zloty makes imported goods more expensive, boosting
inflation.
