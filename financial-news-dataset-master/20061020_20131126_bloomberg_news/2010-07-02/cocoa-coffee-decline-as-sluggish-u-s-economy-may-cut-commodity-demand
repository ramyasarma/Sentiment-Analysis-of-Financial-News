             Cocoa prices fell, capping the
biggest weekly drop since mid-May, on concerns that commodity
demand will slacken amid a fragile economic recovery in the U.S.
Coffee also slumped.  
 Private employers added fewer workers to payrolls in June
than forecast, a government report today showed. The report
follows data indicating weakness in the housing market and
sluggish manufacturing. Cocoa dropped 4.6 percent this week and
is down 9.7 percent in 2010.  
 “I suspect that the recent slowdown in the U.S. is
weighing more on the markets than perceived,” said  Dennis Cajigas , a senior market strategist at brokerage MF Global
Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  
 Cocoa for September delivery fell $70, or 2.3 percent, to
$2,971 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery dropped 3.95
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $1.643 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. The price declined 2.7 percent this week.  
 “With the economic news lately, people aren’t buying
commodities,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price
Futures Group Inc., a broker in Chicago.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities fell for
the second straight day and has lost 10 percent this year.
