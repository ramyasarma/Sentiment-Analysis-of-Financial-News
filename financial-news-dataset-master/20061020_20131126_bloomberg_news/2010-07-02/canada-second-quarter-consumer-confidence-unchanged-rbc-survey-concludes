             Canadian consumer confidence was
unchanged in the second quarter compared with the January-March
period as people were more optimistic about the economy and
downbeat about their own finances, according to a  Royal Bank of
Canada  survey.  
 The Canadian Consumer Outlook Index remained at 108, the
Toronto-based bank said today. The index was set at 100 when it
was first tallied in November as the economy was coming out of a
recession.  
 “It’s been holding steady but above the concern registered
in the November survey,” said  Paul Ferley , assistant chief
economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. The response to
the question about the current economy suggests optimism may
increase in future reports, he said.  
 The share of people saying the overall economic outlook is
good increased to 67 percent from 54 percent, while 27 percent
said their own financial situation will improve in the next
three months, down from 33 percent.  
 The index is calculated from responses to an online survey
conducted by Ipsos Reid. The poll of 3,229 Canadians was taken
June 1-8 and weighted to reflect the makeup of the total
population. An un-weighted survey of this size has a margin of
error of 1.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
