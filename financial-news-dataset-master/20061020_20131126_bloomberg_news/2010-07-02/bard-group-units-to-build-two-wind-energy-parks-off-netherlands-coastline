             ZeeEnergie CV and Buitengaats CV,
units of German wind-turbine maker Bard Group, agreed with the
Dutch government to build two wind-energy parks off the
country’s northern coast.  
 The installations, planned about 55 kilometers (34 miles)
north of the Dutch coastal island of Schiermonnikoog, will have
a combined capacity of 600 megawatts, enough electricity to
power about 660,000 households, the economic affairs ministry
said today in an e-mailed  statement .  
 The agreement was signed after a tender process that had a
total budget of 4.5 billion euros ($5.6 billion), the ministry
said. No other financial details were given.  
 Construction will start by Aug. 1, 2013, it said.
