             Lagardere SCA  plans an initial public
offering of its stake in pay-TV operator Canal Plus France after
 Vivendi SA  balked at an asking price of about 1.35 billion euros
($1.7 billion), said two people familiar with the matter.  
 Lagardere today said it’s starting the IPO process after
talks to sell the 20 percent stake to Vivendi failed. Vivendi
owns the rest of Canal Plus France, the country’s largest pay-TV
operator, and has the right to pre-empt the stake’s sale,
according to a 2007 shareholder agreement. The two sides
couldn’t agree on the price, said the people, declining to be
identified because the talks are private.  
 “Lagardere is hoping that this ploy will force Vivendi
back to the negotiating table,”  Conor O’Shea , an analyst at
Kepler Capital Markets in Paris, said in a note to clients.
“This can only be a positive, as the market has been
pessimistic about Lagardere’s chances of being able to dispose”
of the stake this year, he said.  
 Vivendi Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Bernard Levy  has said
the company, which owns the world’s largest music and video-game
providers, wants to buy out minority partners in Canal Plus and
SFR, the second-largest French mobile-phone operator. On Feb. 1,
it bought M6-Metropole Television’s 5.1 percent stake in Canal
Plus France for 384.2 million euros. In December, Vivendi
acquired Societe Television Francaise 1’s 9.9 percent Canal Plus
France stake for 744 million euros.  
 Analysts’ estimates of the value of the 20 percent Canal
Plus France stake range from Citigroup’s 850 million euros to
Credit Suisse’s 1.4 billion euros.  
 Simplify Structures  
 Lagardere  rose  0.8 percent to 24.72 euros as of 12:22 p.m.
in Paris trading, while Vivendi  climbed  1 percent to 16.45
euros, valuing the companies at 3.2 billion euros and 20.2
billion euros respectively.  
 The IPO decision is in line with terms of a shareholder
accord signed in January 2007, Lagardere said in a statement
today. According to the pact, Vivendi has the right to pre-empt
a sale of the stake by Lagardere, which can then either begin an
IPO or defer the process for another year. The owner of Elle
magazine and Paris Match has until 2014 to sell.  
 Vivendi and Lagardere, both based in Paris, are trying to
simplify their corporate structures. In addition to Canal Plus,
Vivendi is considering buying the 44 percent stake in its SFR
mobile phone unit held by  Vodafone Group Plc , while Lagardere
may sell its 7.5 percent stake in  European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co.   
 Vivendi agreed in December to sell its 20 percent stake in
NBC Universal, the operator of the NBC television network and
the Universal film studios, to  General Electric Co.  for $5.8
billion. The deal gave Levy cash for acquisitions at home and in
emerging markets, where he is seeking new revenue.  
 In November, Vivendi outbid  Telefonica SA  for a Brazilian
fixed-line telecom operator, GVT Holding SA. The French company
agreed to pay $4.18 billion, raising its initial $3 billion bid.
