             The Arizona Diamondbacks fired
Manager  A.J. Hinch  and General Manager  Josh Byrnes  in an effort
to change the fortunes of the team that’s last in Major League
Baseball’s National League West Division.  
 Kirk Gibson  will take over the manager’s duties for the
remainder of the season and Jerry Dipoto will become interim
general manager, Diamondbacks President and Chief Executive
Officer Derrick Hall said in a statement on the team’s website.  
 “We have all been disappointed in the results over the
last few years,” Hall said.  
 Arizona has slumped to a 31-48 record this season, the
fourth-worst in baseball. Last year the Diamondbacks finished
last in the NL West with a 70-92 mark. The team is currently
15.5 games behind NL West leader the San Diego Padres.  
 Gibson has been the Diamondbacks’ bench coach since the
start of the 2007 season. Dipoto was in charge of scouting as
the vice president of player personnel for the past two seasons.  
 Hinch posted an 89-123 record with the Diamondbacks after
being named the fifth manager in franchise history on May 8,
2009.  
 Byrnes became general manager on Oct. 28, 2005. The
Diamondbacks compiled a 349-378 record during his five seasons
and won the NL West Division with a league-best 90-72 mark in
2007 before advancing to the League Championship Series.
