             Interest-rate swap spreads were mixed
as Treasury note yields fluctuated after a U.S. payrolls report
showed private employers added fewer workers in June than
forecast as total employment fell for the first time this year.  
 The difference between the  rate  to exchange floating- for
fixed-interest payments and  Treasury  yields for two years, known
as the  swap  spread, widened 0.87 basis point to 37 basis points.
It’s down from the end of last week, when it closed at 37.25
basis points, a 9 percent gain from June 18. The 30-year swap
spread narrowed 0.19 basis point to minus 18.25 basis points. It
increased 0.25 basis points for the week.  
 U.S. employers cut 125,000 jobs in June, fewer than
forecast, the Labor Department reported today. The median
estimate of 82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
reduction of 130,000. Private payrolls increased by 83,000,
fewer than the 110,000 gain forecast by economists in a separate
Bloomberg survey.  
 The payroll “report solidifies our consistent, two-year-
old call that there will be no Fed rate hikes in 2010,” wrote
 Lena Komileva , head of Group of Seven economics at Tullett
Prebon Plc in London in a note to clients today. “A U.S.
slowdown in the second half of the year carries the potential of
triggering another capital markets shock.”  
 Federal Reserve policy makers last week reiterated their
intent to keep the benchmark interest rate “exceptionally low”
for an “extended period.” It has been at a range of zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008.  
 The two-year Treasury note yielded 0.63 percent today,
little changed, and the 10-year note yield was 2.97 percent, up
2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point.  
 Credit-Risk Perceptions  
 Swap spreads, based in part on expectations for the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, are used as a gauge of
investor perceptions of credit risk. They serve as benchmarks
for investors in many types of debt, including mortgage-backed
and auto-loan securities.  
 Three-month dollar Libor was little changed at 0.5336
percent, according to the British Bankers’ Association. The
Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of demand for cash and banks’
willingness to lend, was also little changed at 33.63 basis
points.  
 Implied yields on Eurodollar futures, the world’s most
actively traded contract and a driver of movements in swap
rates, were mixed.  
 The December 2010 contract implied yield was 0.73 percent,
down 3 basis points, while the implied yield on the December
2011 contract was 1.335 percent, up four basis points. Movements
in implied yields, which are calculated by subtracting the
quoted price from 100, give traders bets on where three-month
dollar Libor will be in the future.
