             The  Amsterdam Exchanges Index  rose
2.03, or 0.7 percent, to 309.9 as of 10:17 a.m. local time, the
first increase in four days. Belgium’s  Bel20 Index  was little
changed at 2,338.27.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the
Benelux markets today. Symbols are in parentheses.  
 Dutch stocks:  
 Grontmij NV  (GRONT NA) dropped 1 percent to 14.70 euros,
falling for a fourth day. The designer of roads and bridges said
the sale of non-core assets including German subsidiary Kontrola
resulted in a book loss of 0.5 million euros ($0.6 million) in
the first half of the year.  
 Heineken NV  (HEIA NA) slid 1.9 percent to 33.98 euros, the
lowest level in more than a month. The Dutch brewer of Amstel
beer was removed from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s “conviction
buy” list.  
 SBM Offshore NV  (SBMO NA) added 1.4 percent to 11.58 euros,
the first gain in four days. The world’s largest producer of
floating oil-production platforms won an extension to lease and
operate a floating storage unit in Congo for Total SA.  
 Sligro Food Group NV  (SLIGR NA) added 2.1 percent to 23.89
euros, the highest level in more than a week. The second-largest

supermarkets and a meat processing unit.  
 Belgian stocks:  
 Ageas  (AGS BB) rose 0.6 percent to 1.78 euros, partly
reversing yesterday’s 4.5 percent fall. The insurer formerly
known as Fortis agreed to buy Kwik-Fit Insurance Services from
PAI Partners for 215 million pounds ($326 million) to strengthen
its U.K. business.
