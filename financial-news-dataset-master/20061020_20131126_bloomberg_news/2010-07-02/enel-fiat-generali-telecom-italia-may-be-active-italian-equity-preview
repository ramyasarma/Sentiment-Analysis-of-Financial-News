             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index  rose
130.09, or 0.7 percent, to 19,073.85 in Milan. The gauge fell
4.5 percent this week.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Enel SpA  (ENEL IM) rose for the first time in four
sessions, gaining 0.7 percent to 3.46 euros. Fidentiis Equities
SV SA initiated coverage of Italy’s biggest utility with a
“buy” recommendation, saying in a note that “in its core
markets, Italy and Spain, Enel has been able to pursue effective
power forward sales campaigns, locking in prices and margins
above the market average.”  
 Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso SpA  (ES IM) lost 5.9 cents, or
3.9 percent, to 1.45 euros, the lowest in about nine months.
Gruppo Banca Leonardo cut its price estimate on the publisher to
2.1 euros from 2.6 euros, with a “buy” rating unchanged, after
trimming its revenue expectations.  
 Landi Renzo SpA  (LR IM) dropped 14 cents, or 4.7 percent,
to 2.86 euros, ending a two-day increase. Exane BNP Paribas
reiterated an “underperform” recommendation on the maker of
injection systems for alternative fuels because of “increasing
price pressure on Landi Renzo in the coming months.” Still, the
brokerage put its price estimate of 2.9 euros under review after
the company agreed to buy A.E.B. Srl, a maker of electronic
systems.  
 Mediaset SpA  (MS IM) fell 6.5 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
4.44 euros, extending losses of 3.9 percent yesterday.
Mediobanca Securities trimmed its price estimate on the
broadcaster to 6.64 euros from 7.46 euros, citing the “impact
of the recent market turmoil.” The brokerage kept an
“outperform” rating.  
 Saipem SpA  (SPM IM), Europe’s largest oilfield-services
provider, ended a three-day loss, rising 87 cents, or 3.5
percent, to 25.49 euros. Oil stocks gained in Europe, led by
Dana Petroleum Plc after a takeover approach from Korea National
Oil Corp.  
 Tenaris SA  (TEN IM), the world’s biggest maker of seamless
steel tubes for oil and gas extraction, increased 33 cents, or
2.4 percent, to 14.38 euros.
