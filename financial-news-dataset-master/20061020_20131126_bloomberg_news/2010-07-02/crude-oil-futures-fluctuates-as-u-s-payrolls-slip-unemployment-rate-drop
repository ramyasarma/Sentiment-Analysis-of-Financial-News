             Crude oil dropped for a fifth day
after a U.S. government report showed that employment slipped in
June for the first time this year and factory orders declined
more than forecast.  
 Oil fell 1.1 percent after the Labor Department said
payrolls decreased by 125,000 last month as the government cut
225,000 temporary census workers. The 1.4 percent reduction in
 bookings  with manufacturers was the biggest since March 2009,
the Commerce Department said. Economists in a Bloomberg News
survey projected a 0.5 percent drop.  
 “We’re going to have a rough third quarter and that will
show up in oil prices,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy
economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Washington. “This is going to
be a rough spot, but it doesn’t mean we’re headed for a double-
dip recession.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery fell 81 cents to $72.14 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since June 8. Prices slipped 8.5 percent in five
days, the biggest weekly drop since the week ended May 7.  
 There will be no floor trading on the Nymex on July 5
because of the Independence Day holiday.  
 “There’s nothing that came out today that would give
shorts a reason to cover or bulls a reason to be brave coming
into a three-day weekend,” said  James Cordier , portfolio
manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa, Florida. “If the stock
market can just steady next week, crude can bounce back to
$74.”  
 The U.S. recession started in December 2007, according to
the National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S.
business cycles. The NBER panel responsible for deciding when
U.S. recessions begin and end said April 12 that it’s too soon
to declare the current slump is over.  
 Falling Equities  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  declined 0.5 percent to
1,022.02 at 3:09 p.m. in New York, and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped 53.69 points, or 0.6 percent, to 9,678.84.  
 Employment at companies in the U.S. rose 83,000, according
to the Labor Department’s report. The jobless rate fell to 9.5
percent from 9.7 percent as the workforce shrank.  
 “The fundamentals of the market remain negative,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. “If we don’t get some positive economic
news, we will soon test $70.”  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its growth forecast for China
this year to 10.1 percent from 11.4 percent as government
restrictions on lending and real estate slow expansion in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy. China’s 2010 growth
outlook was reduced to 9.8 percent from 10.5 percent.  
 Chinese Manufacturing  
 Chinese manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in 16
months, a survey of purchasing managers showed yesterday. Stocks
declined around the world this week on evidence that a cooling
Chinese economy combined with austerity measures in Europe and
slower growth in the U.S. will hurt the global recovery.  
 “The surprising numbers from China this week can’t be
ignored,” Sieminski said.  
 Barclays Capital reduced its price forecasts for crude oil
for the fourth quarter and 2011 as economic pessimism outweighed
“positive surprises” on rising demand.  
 West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil, the U.S. and
European benchmarks, will average $87 a barrel in the fourth
quarter, analysts led by  Paul Horsnell  wrote in a research
report today. The bank said WTI will average $92 next year and
that Brent will be $91 a barrel. That’s a cut of $5 a barrel for
WTI and $4 for Brent.  
 Brent crude oil for August settlement fell 69 cents, or 1
percent, to end the session at $71.65 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London. It was the lowest settlement
since May 25.  
 U.S. Inventories  
 An Energy Department report on June 30 showed that U.S.
gasoline  stockpiles  unexpectedly gained last week as crude oil
inventories dropped 2.01 million barrels.  
 The increase in fuel supplies helped narrow the margin, or
 crack spread , for processing three barrels of oil into two of
gasoline and one of heating oil to the lowest level since March
1. The margin slipped 0.9 percent to $10.033 a barrel, based on
New York futures prices.  
 Gasoline for August delivery decreased 1.99 cents, or 1
percent, to $1.9777 a gallon in New York, the lowest settlement
since May 26. Heating oil for August delivery fell 2.3 cents, or
1.2 percent, to end the session at $1.9155 a gallon, the least
since May 25.  
 Twenty of 38 analysts, or 53 percent, surveyed by Bloomberg
News forecast crude will decline through July 9. Ten
respondents, or 26 percent, predicted that futures will be
little changed and eight saw an increase. Last week an equal
number of analysts predicted a gain or drop.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 387,476 contracts at 3:08 p.m.
in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 698,340
contracts yesterday, 11 percent less than the average of the
past three months. Open interest was 1.27 million contracts.
