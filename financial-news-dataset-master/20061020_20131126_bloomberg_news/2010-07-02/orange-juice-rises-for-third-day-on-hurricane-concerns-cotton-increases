             Orange-juice futures rose, capping
the biggest weekly gain since January, on concern that storms
may damage the citrus crop in Florida, the world’s second-
biggest producer. Cotton prices declined.  
 The U.S. National Hurricane Center has projected 14 to 23
named storms forming before Nov. 30, more than average,
increasing the chance of lost fruit in Florida. In the week
ended June 22, hedge-fund managers and other large speculators
increased their net-long positions in orange-juice futures by 26
percent from a week earlier, according to government data.  
 “People are worried about next season’s crop,” said
 Carlos Sanchez , an associate director of research at asset
manager CPM Group in New York.  
 Orange juice for September delivery rose 2.45 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $1.511 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. This
week, the price climbed 6.1 percent. The commodity has surged 90
percent in the past year on concern that supplies will trail
demand.  
 Florida’s orange crop will fall 18 percent to 133.6 million
boxes in the harvest ending in July from last season, the U.S.
government said last month. A box weighs 90 pounds, or 41
kilograms. Brazil is the world’s biggest grower.  
 Prices often fluctuate on storm forecasts during the
Atlantic hurricane season, which lasts through November.  
 Cotton futures for December delivery declined 0.92 cent, or
1.2 percent, to 75.53 cents a pound in New York. This week, the
price dropped 4.3 percent. The fiber has climbed 24 percent in
the past year.  
 Informa Outlook  
 Today, Informa Economics Inc. increased its 2010 U.S.
production forecast to 18.6 million bales from 16 million
projected in June. Last year, output was 12.2 million,
government data show. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  
 Informa, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is a research company
whose forecasts are widely followed in the industry. The U.S. is
the largest exporter.  
 India, the world’s second-largest grower and shipper, plans
to end curbs on exports in the year starting Oct. 1 amid
forecasts for a record harvest.  
 Export registrations were halted in April to cool domestic
prices and bolster supplies. A month later, a permit system for
shipments was introduced.
