             Rey Wium , voted South Africa’s top
luxury goods and tobacco analyst in  Financial Mail ’s 2010 survey
of fund managers, quit  Nedbank Group Ltd.  to join  Barnard Jacobs
Mellet Holdings Ltd.   
 Wium, who covers companies such as  Cie Financiere Richemont
SA  and  British American Tobacco Plc , will continue to research
the same industry when he starts at BJM’s securities business on
July 5,  Gerhard Engelbrecht , the head of research at BJM, said
in a telephone interview in Johannesburg today.  
 “This is an important sector, with a high weighting in the
All Share index, and we weren’t covering it as our analyst left
the country almost a year ago,” Engelbrecht said. The brokerage
is looking to hire analysts “in other key sectors,” he said,
declining to be more specific.  
 Wium, who has also worked at Afrifocus Securities, joins
BJM after it agreed in May to sell its securities business to
Renaissance Capital. Shareholders of BJM will vote on the
transaction on July 12.
