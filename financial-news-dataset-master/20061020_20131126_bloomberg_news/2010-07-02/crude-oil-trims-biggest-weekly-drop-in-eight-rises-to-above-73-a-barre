             Crude oil gained, paring the biggest
weekly loss in eight, as equities in Asia rose and investors
bought contracts on the view that prices have fallen too far,
too fast.  
 Oil snapped four days of declines as commodity stocks
gained after Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  reached an
agreement with mining companies on a resources tax. Oil has
dropped 7.2 percent so far this week amid weaker economic data
from the U.S. and China.  
 “Prices have come off in the past three weeks, people
might just take the opportunity to buy,” said  Serene Lim , an
energy and commodity strategist with Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “The mining tax is a small
factor, but may give some positive sentiment to oil prices.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery rose as much as 43 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $73.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It was at $73.20 at 12:44 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract fell $2.68 yesterday to $72.95, the lowest settlement
price since June 8. The market’s four-day drop through yesterday
was the longest pullback since May 18.  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent to 9,241.49
as of 12:46 p.m. in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained 0.5
percent to 832.47, with almost twice as many stocks advancing as
declining. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.4 percent as of
1:28 p.m. in Tokyo as markets in Hong Kong and China fell.  
 China’s manufacturing growth slowed for a second month in
June, adding to signs the fastest-expanding major economy is
cooling.  
 Oil is poised for a decline of 7.2 percent for the week,
the biggest drop since the week ended May 7. Futures lost 9.7
percent in the three months ended June 30, the first quarterly
decline since 2008.  
 ‘Not as Strong’  
 “We’ve had a whole lot of macro data from all around the
world suggesting that the prospects for economic growth aren’t
as strong as people were expecting,” said  Toby Hassall , a
commodity analyst at CWA Global Markets Pty in Sydney. “Global
growth concerns feed through to prospects for fuel demand.”  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s  gauge  of
manufacturing fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 a month earlier,
according to the Tempe, Arizona-based group. A reading greater
than 50 indicates expansion. Economists had forecast the measure
would fall to 59, according to the median of 81 projections in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Brent crude for August delivery rose as much as 49 cents,
or 0.7 percent to $72.83 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, and was at $72.70 a barrel at 12:48 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, it slipped $2.67, or 3.6 percent, to
end the session at $72.34, also was the lowest settlement since
June 8.  
 Rising Inventories  
 Oil prices also dropped yesterday because of rising fuel
inventories. U.S.  gasoline inventories  rose 537,000 barrels to
218.1 million in the week ended June 25, according to an Energy
Department report. Supplies were forecast to decrease by 400,000
barrels, based on a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  
 Alex, the first June Atlantic hurricane since 1995, was
downgraded to a tropical depression as it dissipates over the
mountains of central Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center
said on its website. At its height, Alex reached Category 2
status with winds of 100 miles (161 kilometers) an hour.  
 Producers have started returning workers to platforms in
the Gulf, according to Bristow U.S. LLC, a helicopter services
company. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port is resuming offloading
operations at 9 p.m. local time yesterday,  Barb Hestermann , a
port spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  
 Crude oil may fall next week as data on manufacturing,
jobless claims and home sales bolster concern the U.S. economic
recovery is faltering, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Twenty of 38 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through July 9. Ten respondents, or 26 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and eight saw an
increase. Last week an equal number of analysts forecast a gain
or drop.
