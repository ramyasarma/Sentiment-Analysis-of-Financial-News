             The “worst part” of the European
debt crisis is over and Greece’s near default has convinced
European Union leaders of the need for a common fiscal policy,
former EU Commission President  Romano Prodi  said.  
 EU leaders were “late and slow” in addressing the crisis
caused by Greece’s deteriorating finances, Prodi said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television from Beijing today.  
 The euro has declined 13 percent against the dollar this
year as the Greek crisis fuelled investor concern that the 11-
year-old currency might unravel if other high-deficit countries
like Spain and Portugal needed the type of emergency aid
extended to Greece. EU leaders will eventually adopt a common
fiscal policy to control deficits, Prodi said.  
 “It’s much more clear to the Europe politicians now at
last that there is no alternative,” he said. “It will take a
long time.”  
 Prodi, a two-time Italian prime minister, said there is
little risk Greece or any other country will seek to abandon the
single currency.  
 “I don’t think that there will be any danger of Europe
collapsing or Europe dissolving,” he said. “The interests of
the euro members are to keep the currency as it is and to
strengthen their links.”
