             Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of 
Poland’s largest opposition party Law & Justice, pulled ahead 
of acting President Bronislaw Komorowski by 49 percent to 47 
percent in a GfK Polonia survey published today on the website 
of daily Rzeczpospolita before a July 4 presidential runoff.  
 The telephone survey of 1,000 voters, taken on July 1, is 
the first to show Komorowski, the candidate of the ruling Civic
Platform party, trailing Kaczynski, twin brother of President 
Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in an April 10 plane crash.  
 The newspaper said the raw numbers of the poll showed 45 
percent support for each candidate. The results were then 
adjusted for demographic criteria, expected shifts in voter 
preferences, and by removing respondents who planned to be on 
vacation away from their homes on July 4, Rzeczpospolita said. 
According to the poll, 4 percent of voters remain undecided.
