             Italy’s Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena SpA and Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl are among 20
European banks that may need to raise as much as 30 billion
euros ($37 billion) after this month’s stress tests, the
Financial Times reported, citing unnamed bankers.  
 Banco Popular Espanol SA, as well as Portuguese, Greek and
Irish lenders, may also need to boost capital, the FT reported.
About two-thirds of the capital raising will be among state-
owned institutions, the newspaper said.
