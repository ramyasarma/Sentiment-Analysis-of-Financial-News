             India’s current-account deficit may
“remain high” this year as economic growth boosts imports,
adding pressure on the rupee to weaken in the near term, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said.  
 “There are near-term weakening pressures on the rupee
exacerbated by external uncertainties,” Goldman Sachs
economists Pranjul Bhandari and Tushar Poddar wrote in a report
to clients yesterday.  
 The  current-account  gap, a measure of trade and investment
flows, widened to a record $13 billion in the quarter through
March, the central bank said June 30, sending the rupee headed
to its biggest weekly loss in a month. The currency slid 0.7
percent this week to 46.625 per dollar at 1:30 p.m. in Mumbai.  
 The  Reserve Bank of India  yesterday said India has become
more vulnerable to slowdowns and financial crises abroad as
foreign trade plays a bigger role in the economy. Trade
represented 35 percent of gross domestic product in the year
ended March 31, 2008, from 21 percent a decade earlier,
according to the central bank.  
 Goldman economists expect the rupee to gain over a six-to-
12-month period as faster growth attracts foreign investments.  
 Goldman forecasts the rupee to touch 47.5 against the
dollar in three months, 46 in six months and 44.5 in a year,
according to the note.  
 India’s $1.2 trillion economy may expand 8.5 percent in the
year ending March 31, from 7.4 percent in the previous year,
according to the finance ministry.
