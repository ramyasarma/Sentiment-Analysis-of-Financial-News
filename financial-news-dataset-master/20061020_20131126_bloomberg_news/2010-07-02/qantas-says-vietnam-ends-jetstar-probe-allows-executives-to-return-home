             Vietnam concluded a probe into an
affiliate of  Qantas Airways Ltd.  and allowed two executives to
leave the country, the Australian carrier said.  
 No criminal investigation or charges were leveled against
the Qantas staff,  Olivia Wirth , a spokeswoman for Australia’s
largest carrier, said by phone today.  Daniela Marsilli , Jetstar
Pacific Airlines Joint-Stock Aviation Co.’s former chief
operating officer and ex-Chief Financial Officer  Tristan Freeman 
are now in Australia, she said.  
 The two Australians had been preventing from leaving
Vietnam since January as the country investigated Jetstar
Pacific, 27 percent-owned by Qantas and the rest by the
government. Jetstar Pacific’s ex-Chief Executive Officer Luong
Hoai Nam was also detained after “serious losses” were
discovered, the Vietnamese foreign ministry said in January.  
 The government was investigating a $31 million loss on fuel
hedging, the Vietnamese Tuoi Tre newspaper reported on Jan. 8,
citing a state audit.  
 Nguyen Duc Vy, a deputy head of an advisory unit at the
Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, declined to comment
today.  
 Marsilli and Freeman will now work in Australia, Wirth said.
Jetstar Pacific has appointed two Vietnamese nationals to take
over their former posts temporarily, she said.
