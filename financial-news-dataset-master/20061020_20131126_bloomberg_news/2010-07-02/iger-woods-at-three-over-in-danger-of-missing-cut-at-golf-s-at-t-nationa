             Tiger Woods  enters the third
round of the AT&T National trailing leader  Justin Rose  by
10 shots after making the 36-hole cut without a stroke to
spare.  
 Woods shot an even-par 70 in yesterday’s second round
and is at 3-over 143 midway through the U.S. PGA Tour event
at Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania.
Those who shot 144 or higher failed to advance to weekend
play.  
 “When you’re not making any putts, what are you going
to do?” Woods told reporters after the round. “No matter
how good I drive it, it doesn’t matter; the putts aren’t
going in. I’ve just got to putt better.”  
 Woods missed the cut at the Quail Hollow Championship
in April, the first time in five years he had failed to
reach weekend play in a regular U.S. PGA Tour event.  
 Seeking his first victory of the season as he prepares
for the British Open later this month, Woods had bogeys on
two of his final five holes. The No. 1 golfer in the
Official World Rankings mixed in four birdies, along with
two other bogeys for the day.  
 Englishman Rose shot a 6-under 64 yesterday to take
the two-round lead at 133. Australia’s  Jason Day  and South
Korea’s  Charlie Wi  are a stroke back at 6-under 134 after
two rounds.  
 Woods, 34, is the event’s defending champion and
served as the tournament’s host the previous three years.
Woods and his foundation hosted the AT&T National from
2007-09 at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda,
Maryland.  
 AT&T Inc ., the largest U.S. phone company, ended its
endorsement agreement with Woods on Dec. 31 after details
about his admitted marital infidelity emerged. Woods no
longer carries the AT&T logo on his bag or serves as the
event’s official host, though it still benefits his
foundation.
