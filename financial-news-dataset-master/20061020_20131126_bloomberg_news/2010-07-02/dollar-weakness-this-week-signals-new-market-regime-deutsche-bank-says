             The dollar’s drop against the euro
and yen this week in the face of falling stock markets signals
more weakness as investors reduce bets on rate increases by the
Federal Reserve, according to Deutsche Bank AG.     
 The dollar may fall as low as 76 yen although spot prices
below 80 yen would “likely elicit intervention,” Bilal Hafeez,
a London-based strategist with Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to
clients dated yesterday.    
 “The dollar continues to weaken, despite stock weakness,
which suggests new market regime,” Hafeez wrote. “This fits
our view of the yen outperforming the dollar if the Fed remains
on hold for the foreseeable future, which the market is
increasingly pricing.”
