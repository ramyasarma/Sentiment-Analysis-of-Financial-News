             Banks need “more stringent” rules
on liquidity and limits on the amounts they can borrow,  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA  Chief Executive Officer  Corrado Passera  wrote in  Il
Sole 24 Ore  today.  
 Rules proposed by the Basel Committee of Banking and
Supervision risk penalizing commercial banks and could lead to
tighter lending if they were implemented at once, Passera wrote.
Stress tests should be published and should be applied to a
large pool of lenders, he also said.
