             Continental AG , Europe’s second-
biggest auto-parts maker, unexpectedly reported a jump in first-
half profit and increased sales more than analysts predicted.
The stock rose.  
 First-half earnings before interest and taxes adjusted for
one-time items were at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion),
compared with 248.8 million euros a year earlier, the Hanover,
Germany-based company said today in a statement. Sales climbed
38 percent to about 12.5 billion euros, beating analysts’
average estimate of 11.7 billion euros.  
 Continental  rose  as much as 76.5 euros, or 1.8 percent, to
42.77 euros and traded at 42.66 euros as of 12:14 p.m. in
Frankfurt.  
 The company said today it’s “realistic” to increase sales
by about 15 percent this year, with an adjusted Ebit margin in a
range of 8 percent to 8.5 percent. Last month, Chief Executive
Officer Elmar Degenhart forecast full-year sales to increase
more than 10 percent.   
 Higher raw-material costs will burden second-half earnings
by about 250 million euros, the company said today.  
 Continental is aiming to combine with dominant shareholder
Schaeffler Group, the world’s second-biggest roller-bearing
maker.
