             South Africa’s rand is headed for “a
large negative correction” next week as it loses a boost from
higher gold prices and hosting the World Cup, Danske Bank A/S
said.  
 The currency is “fundamentally overvalued,” chief analyst
 Lars Christensen  wrote in a research note dated today. “The
only two factors playing in favor of the rand are the World Cup,
but that will soon end, and high gold prices, which also have
been losing some steam in recent days,” Danske Bank wrote. The
bank recommends buying the Czech koruna over the rand.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy depreciated as
much as 0.3 percent to 7.7627 to the dollar, from a close of
7.7379 yesterday, and traded up 0.3 percent at 7.7229 as of 3
p.m. in Johannesburg.  
 South African Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  today said
the soccer World Cup will add 0.4 percentage points to gross
domestic product, with the number of visitors being “far
higher” than previously estimated, reaching “closer to
500,000.”  
 Gold traded at $1,209.80 an ounce in London after dropping
3.5 percent to $1,198.95 yesterday, the most since Feb. 4, as
global equities and most commodities declined. Bullion headed
for a second weekly loss after trading within 0.2 percent of a
record at the beginning of the week.  
 The bank said other factors likely to lead to a
depreciation of the rand include the erosion of the differential
between interest rates in South Africa and other countries, risk
aversion and a “negative technical picture.”  
 Government bonds advanced for a third day in South Africa,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
rising 22 cents to 123.29 rand. The yield on the bond fell 5
basis points to 7.93 percent.
