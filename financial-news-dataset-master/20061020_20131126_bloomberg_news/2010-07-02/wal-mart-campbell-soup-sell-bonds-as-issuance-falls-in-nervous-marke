             Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
biggest retailer, and  Campbell Soup Co. , the largest soup maker,
led $7.58 billion of U.S. corporate bond sales as issuance fell
short of the 2010 average for the ninth time in 10 weeks.  
 Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, sold $3 billion
of debt in a three-part offering, the largest non-financial
issue in more than a month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell sold $400 million
of notes to finance acquisitions and repay debt, Bloomberg data
show.  
 Corporate bond sales fell 61 percent from a week earlier,
Bloomberg data show, as claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly
rose, home sales plunged and a gauge of manufacturing slipped.
Investors are concerned the economic recovery may be faltering
even as corporate cash levels rise and credit-rating upgrades
outpace downgrades, said  Christopher Langs , a money manager at
Aviva Investors North America.  
 “Any headline makes the market very nervous,” said Langs,
who helps manage $3.5 billion of high-yield debt in Chicago.
“Corporate fundamentals are improving even though there’s a lot
of other noise going on.”  
 The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
corporate bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 1 basis point to
208 basis points, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
U.S. Corporate Master Index. Average yields touched 4.32 percent
on June 29, the lowest since April 2004, the index data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 High-Yield Spreads  
 Spreads on high-yield, high-risk debt expanded and absolute
yields rose for the second straight week, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads widened 23 basis
points to 713 basis points while yields rose 17 basis points to
9.2 percent, the data show.  
 High-yield debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  
 Relative yields on U.S. corporate debt widened 65 basis
points in the second quarter, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Globally, corporate bond spreads
expanded 47 basis points, the data show.  
 “The focus of the credit markets this quarter was on the
European sovereign situation and financial reform in the U.S.,
rather than on earnings and balance sheets, and spreads widened
across regions as a result,” said Barclays Plc credit
strategists  Jeffrey Meli  and  Bradley Rogoff  in a July 1 note to
clients.  
 Issuance Lower  
 This week’s corporate sales compare with a 2010 average of
$19.8 billion and issuance last week of $19.6 billion, Bloomberg
data show. Companies sold $184.3 billion of debt in the second
quarter, 43 percent less than in the three months ended March 31
and 44 percent below the year-earlier period.  
 The difference in yields on two- and 10-year Treasuries
increased for the first time in five days on reduced deflation
concern as private employers added positions for a sixth month.  
 The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits
unexpectedly climbed 13,000 to 472,000, according to Labor
Department data, and U.S. manufacturing expanded at the slowest
pace this year as orders fell, Institute for Supply Management
statistics show.  
 The yield on 10-year Treasuries, the market bellwether,
 fell  to 2.98 percent from 3.11 percent a week earlier. The extra
yield investors demand to hold the debt instead of two-year
notes narrowed to 2.35 percentage points from 2.46 percentage
points.  
 More Upgrades  
 During the quarter, S&P lifted the ratings of 252 U.S.
issuers while cutting 218, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Moody’s upgraded 209 borrowers and lowered ratings on
136. Upgrades haven’t surpassed downgrades since the second
quarter of 2007.  
 Cash at investment-grade companies rose to $668 billion at
the end of the first quarter from $580 billion a year earlier,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by  Eric Beinstein  in New York
wrote last week. Debt fell 2 percent to $2.3 trillion.  
 Wal-Mart sold $750 million of 2.25 percent, 5-year notes,
$1.5 billion of 3.625 percent, 10-year debt and $750 million of
4.875 percent, 30-year bonds to lead $5.93 billion of
investment-grade issuance this week, Bloomberg data show.  
 The issue was the biggest debt sale by a non-financial U.S.
company since Discovery Communications sold $3 billion of debt
on May 26, Bloomberg data show.  
 ‘Financially Strong’  
 “Wal-Mart just happens to be an extremely financially
strong company, and they’re doing what a lot of financially
strong households will be doing, and that’s refinancing their
mortgages,” said  William Larkin , who helps manage $500 million
at Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts.  
 The company sold $2.5 billion of bonds in April 2008 in a
two-part offering and $500 million of debt due in 2038 in a
reopening of securities from that issue 15 months later,
Bloomberg data show.  
 The retailer paid 53 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries on its notes due in 2015, compared with the
45 basis-point spread it received when it sold $750 million of
2.875 percent, five-year debt as part of its $2 billion offering
in March, the data show. It paid 108 basis points on its bonds
due in 2040 in the latest sale, compared with 130 basis points
in its April 2008 offering of 30-year bonds.  
 Campbell’s offering was its largest since 2002, when it
issued $400 million of 10-year notes, Bloomberg data show. “One
of our business strategies is to strengthen our business through
outside partnerships and acquisitions,”  Anthony Sanzio , a
Campbell spokesman, said in an e-mail.  
 Fidelity, Delta  
 FMR LLC, the mutual-fund manager known as Fidelity
Investments, sold $400 million of 30-year bonds and Delta Air
Lines Inc. issued $450 million of 8-year pass-through trust
certificates backed by two dozen airplanes, among the week’s
other investment-grade offerings.  
 DynCorp International Inc., the U.S. defense contractor
being  acquired  by Cerberus Capital Management LP, sold $455
million of seven-year notes and Insight Communications Co., the
cable television operator partly owned by Carlyle Group, issued
$400 million of debt due in 2018 to lead $1.66 billion of high-
yield bond offerings, Bloomberg data show.  
 Junk debt sales fell 38 percent from a week earlier, when
they totaled $2.68 billion. They were 64 percent below the 2010
average of $4.62 billion, Bloomberg data show.
