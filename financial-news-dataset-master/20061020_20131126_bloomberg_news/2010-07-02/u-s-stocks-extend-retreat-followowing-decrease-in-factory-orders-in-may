             U.S. stocks extended declines after
factory orders fell more than forecast in May, adding to
evidence the economic recovery is slowing.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,025.18 at 10:18 a.m. in New York after gaining as much as 0.5
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 32.5
points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,700.03.     
 The 1.4 percent decrease in factory bookings was the
biggest since March 2009 and followed a revised 1 percent gain
in April, the Commerce Department said today in Washington.
Economists forecast orders would drop 0.5 percent, according to
the median projection in a Bloomberg News survey.
