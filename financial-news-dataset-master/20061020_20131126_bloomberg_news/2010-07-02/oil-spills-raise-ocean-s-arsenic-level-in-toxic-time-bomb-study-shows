             Oil spills like the one in the Gulf
of Mexico interfere with the ocean’s natural filtration system,
allowing  arsenic  levels to build up and threaten the long-term
health of marine plants and animals, researchers found.  
 Minerals on the ocean floor attract arsenic found in
seawater, latching onto the poison and burying it under layers
of sand, silt and sediment, according to a new study released
today by scientists from  Imperial College London . The study was
published today in the journal Water Research.  
 Arsenic is also found in oil. Leaks from underground
reservoirs, spills and wastewater from rigs all increase levels
of the chemical in the ocean and threaten the marine ecosystem
as well as the food chain, the researchers said.  
 “The real danger lies in arsenic’s ability to accumulate,
which means that each subsequent spill raises the levels of this
pollutant in seawater,” said  Mark Sephton , a professor at
Imperial’s department of earth science and engineering. “Our
study is a timely reminder that oil spills could create a toxic
ticking time bomb, which could threaten the fabric of the marine
ecosystem in the future.”  
 Oil creates a barrier between positively charged sediment
in seawater and negatively charged arsenic, and weakens the
magnetic attraction between them, researchers found. The result
is a one-two punch with more arsenic in the water and a clogged
filtration system that traditionally keeps the poison in check,
they said.  
 There is no way to know how much arsenic is currently being
pumped into the Gulf of Mexico from the oil spill at  BP Plc ’s
Macondo well, Sephton said. It started leaking after an April 20
explosion on the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 crew members and
sank the rig.  
 Additional arsenic from the oil and the damaged filtration
system will concentrate in the marine ecosystem, creating ever
more dangerous levels of the poison the further it moves up the
food chain, the researchers said.
