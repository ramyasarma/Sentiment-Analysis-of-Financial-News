             China, the world’s second-biggest
energy user, started construction of its first carbon dioxide
capture and storage project in Ordos in Inner Mongolia to reduce
emissions.  
 The project will cost 210 million yuan ($30.9 million) and
will be able to hold 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a
year,  China National Petroleum Corp ., the country’s biggest oil
producer and the plant’s designer, said in a  statement  on its
website today. The facility will start operations by the end of
the year, it said.  
 China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, pledged
to reduce carbon dioxide it emits for each unit of economic
output by 40 to 45 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels. Carbon
dioxide capture and storage, or  CCS , is a process whereby CO2 is
captured from gases produced by fossil fuel combustion,
compressed, transported and injected into deep geologic
formations for permanent storage, according to the International
Energy Agency.  
 The plant’s annual capacity will be expanded to 1 million
tons and 3 million tons in two phases in the future, according
to the statement, which didn’t give a time frame.  
 The plant is built on the site of a coal-to-liquid project
constructed by  Shenhua Group Corp. , the nation’s largest coal
producer, it said.
