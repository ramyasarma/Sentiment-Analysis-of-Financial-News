             L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt  said in a television interview she has no regrets
about giving a friend 1 billion euros ($1.23 billion) in gifts,
and attributed her daughter’s lawsuit against the friend to
jealousy.  
 Bettencourt’s only child,  Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ,
filed a private prosecution against photographer and author
 Francois-Marie Banier  last year, claiming he manipulated her
infirm mother to get art, real estate and cash gifts. The mother
has opposed her daughter’s effort.  
 Bettencourt, 87, wasn’t pressured by Banier, the heiress
said in an interview with broadcaster  TF1  at her home in
Brittany. She hopes that Banier is still her friend, Bettencourt
said. Her daughter hasn’t attempted a reconciliation, she said.  
 “I understand very well that a daughter can be jealous of
her mother,” Bettencourt said in the interview shown on TF1’s
national evening news program. “I also was jealous of my father
when I saw women flocking around him.”  
 Bettencourt said she understood that the size of her gift
might be shocking. “I understand very well. And so what? Should
I take it back?”  
 A judged ruled yesterday that recordings of Bettencourt
must be turned over for investigation into their contents. The
recordings, on 28 compact discs, were made secretly by a former
butler beginning in May 2009 and given to Meyers. They have
drawn politicians, including French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
and Labor Minister  Eric Woerth , into the family dispute and
raised questions about whether tax authorities ignored claims
Bettencourt hid 78 million euros in Swiss accounts.  
 Banier could face as much as three years in prison and a
fine of 375,000 euros if found guilty.
