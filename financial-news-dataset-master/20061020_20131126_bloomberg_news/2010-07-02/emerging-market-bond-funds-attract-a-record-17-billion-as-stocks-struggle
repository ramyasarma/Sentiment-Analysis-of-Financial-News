             Global investors shifted money into
emerging-market bonds by the most on record this year on concern
spending cuts by European nations to curb budget deficits will
slow a global recovery, damping demand for stocks.  
 Funds dedicated to debt in developing countries attracted
$17 billion of net inflows in the first six months, compared
with $14 billion in the second-half of 2009, EPFR Global said
today in a statement. A net $4.5 billion was taken out of
emerging-market bonds in the January-June period of last year.  
 “Flows continued to show investors’ marked preference for
fixed-income assets over equity,” according to Cambridge, 
Massachusetts-based  EPFR , which tracks $13 trillion of assets.
The trend also highlighted the “vastly improved perceptions of
emerging-market debt,” the research company said.  
 Dollar bonds in developing nations returned  5.6 percent 
this year through June 30, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBI Global Diversified Index. The market has rallied every
quarter since 2008, the longest winning streak since March 2004.
An index tracking local-currency debt gained  12.1 percent ,
according to JPMorgan Chase.  
 Malaysia, India and Taiwan have raised benchmark  policy
rates  this year as the regional economic recovery gained
traction and exports rebounded. In contrast, Greece, Portugal,
Spain and Hungary are reining in spending to try and reduce the
biggest budget deficits in the European Union.  
 ‘Credit Profile’  
 “Asia’s credit profile is improving for corporates and
sovereigns from Indonesia to India, compared to the weaker
fundamentals in Europe and the U.S.,” said  Carter Cai , a bond
manager at Banyan Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. This
offers better returns for emerging-market investors, he said.  
 Greece’s credit rating was cut to junk on April 27 by
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service put Spain’s Aaa
rating on review for downgrade on July 1.  
 Economic reports on manufacturing, housing and jobs in the
U.S. yesterday also cast doubt on the strength of the U.S.
recovery.  
 Bond funds in developing markets attracted $9.7 billion in
2005, the best year since EPFR started tracking the data in 1995.  
 Emerging-market debt was the only category among fixed-
income funds to receive increased investment in the first half,
EPFR said, with global, high-yield, U.S. and balanced funds all
seeing a reduction compared with the second half of 2009.  
 Stock Funds  
 More than 55 percent of the $17 billion committed to
emerging-nation bonds went to accounts with a mandate for local-
currency debt, EPFR said. “Hard-currency counterparts”
accounted for 20 percent, while mixed funds had the remainder,
it said.  
 Developing-market stock funds received $17.4 billion
between January and June, EPFR said, compared with $47.7 billion
in the second half of 2009 and $35.6 billion in the first half
of that year, it said.  
 Emerging-market countries and companies tapped investors
for $308 billion from bond sales this year through June 30,
versus $292 billion in the same period of 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Asian countries including China,
South Korea and Malaysia boosted their local-currency bond-
market size to  $14.3 billion  in March from $14 billion at the
end of 2009, according to data from the Asian Development Bank.  
 Malaysia raised $1.25 billion from Shariah-compliant dollar
bonds on May 27, its first overseas sale since 2002.
