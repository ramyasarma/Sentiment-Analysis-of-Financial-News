             The euro may rally to $1.31, a level
last seen in May, after breaking above the neckline of a reverse
head-and-shoulders pattern, according to Citigroup Inc.  
 The 16-nation currency closed yesterday at $1.2527, above
the $1.2508 neckline, strategists led by  Tom Fitzpatrick  in New
York wrote in a note to clients published today. The euro
appreciated earlier today to $1.2612, a level above its 55-day
moving average of $1.2250.  
 “We would now like to seek a close above the 55-day moving
average before confirming what looks like a bullish break,” the
analysts wrote.  
 The euro advanced 0.1 percent to $1.2535 at 2:09 p.m. in
New York. The 16-nation currency was last above $1.31 on May 4,
when it touched $1.3214.  
 A head-and-shoulders pattern is formed when a currency
makes three consecutive peaks on a chart, with the middle being
the highest. The line that connects the peaks between the
troughs is known as the neckline. A reverse head-and-shoulders
formation has three successive troughs. A break of the neckline
may indicate a reversal of a decline.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
