Agriculture in Kenya, the world’s biggest producer of black tea,
grew an annual 4.6 percent in the first quarter, the Kenya

nation’s biggest lender, fell to the lowest level in more than a
week, declining 2 pesewas, or 1.2 percent, to 1.6 cedis. The

with Renaissance Capital, said by phone from Accra.

lender, retreated 1 rupee, or 0.7 percent, to 140 rupees. The
Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest company by market value
doesn’t expect results to improve by year-end after it reported
a 10 percent drop in nine-month profit last month, Chief
Executive Officer Pierre-Guy Noel said in the bank’s monthly
newsletter e-mailed after the market closed yesterday.  
 Olympia Capital Holdings Ltd.  (DNKN KN), a Kenyan
investment holding company with interests in floor-tile
manufacturing and building materials, climbed for the third day
in four, advancing 15 cents, or 2 percent, to 7.7 shillings. The
company said its loss for the year narrowed to 14.6 million
shillings from 63.8 million shillings ($783,783) a year earlier,
according to a statement e-mailed by the Nairobi Stock Exchange.  
 Zenith Bank Plc  (ZENITHBA NL), Nigeria’s biggest lender by
