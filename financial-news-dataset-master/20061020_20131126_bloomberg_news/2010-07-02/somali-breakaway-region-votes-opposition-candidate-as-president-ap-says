             Ahmed Mohamud Silanyo, an opposition
candidate, won presidential elections in Somaliland, the
breakaway region of Somalia, Associated Press reported, citing
the National Electoral Commission.  
 Silanyo won 49.6 percent of the vote in the June 26 poll,
with outgoing president Dahir Riyale Kahin coming second, the
news agency said.  
 Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991,
after the fall of former dictator Mohammed Siad Barre. No
sovereign state has recognized Somaliland as an independent
nation.
