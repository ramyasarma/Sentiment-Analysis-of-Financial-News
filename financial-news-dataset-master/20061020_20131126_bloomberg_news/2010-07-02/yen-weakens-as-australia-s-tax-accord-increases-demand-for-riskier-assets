             The dollar rose against most major
counterparts after a report showed U.S. payrolls shed jobs for
the first time this year, signaling the world’s largest economy
may be slow to recover and damping investors’ risk appetite.  
 The euro pared gains against the greenback as U.S. stocks
fell after the payrolls figures were released and another
government report showed orders placed with American  factories 
in May dropped more than forecast.  
 “The recovery in the private sector is still very slow,”
said  Samarjit Shankar , a managing director for the foreign-
exchange group in Boston at BNY Mellon, the world’s largest
custodial bank, with more than $20 trillion in assets under
administration. “It might act as a grind on consumer sentiment
and spending, and hence the U.S. economic recovery might be very
protracted and slow.”  
 The dollar depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.2548 per euro at
4:24 p.m. in New York, from $1.2527 yesterday, when was down 2.3
percent at closing, the most since March 2009. Earlier today the
greenback fell as much as 0.7 percent. It rose 0.2 percent to
87.80 yen, from 87.60. The Japanese currency declined 0.4
percent against the euro to 110.15 yen, from 109.74 yesterday.  
 The euro gained 1.4 percent against the dollar this week.
The yen had a 1.6 percent advance, its fourth weekly gain versus
the greenback, the longest rally since November.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500  index declined for a fifth
straight day, dropping as much as 1.1 percent as financial and
consumer companies retreated.  
 Nonfarm Payrolls  
 Nonfarm payrolls fell last month by 125,000 positions,
compared with a drop of 130,000 forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 82 economists, Labor Department figures showed today
in Washington. The government cut 225,000 temporary workers
conducting the 2010 census, they showed.  
 The number of jobs outside government increased by 83,000,
compared with a gain of 110,000 predicted in a Bloomberg survey.
The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 9.5 percent, from 9.7
percent.  
 Orders placed with U.S. factories in May fell 1.4 percent,
the most since March 2009, the Commerce Department said.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast a drop of 0.5 percent.  
 Data yesterday showed U.S. manufacturing weakened and
contracts to buy existing homes plunged. The  Institute for
Supply Management  said its index of U.S. manufacturing fell to
56.2 in June, exceeding a forecast drop to 59, from 59.7 a month
earlier. The number of contracts in May to purchase previously
owned houses fell by 30 percent, more than double the forecast,
according to figures from the National  Association of Realtors .  
 Worse Was Feared  
 The dollar and yen weakened earlier today against most
major counterparts as U.S. equities rose and the currencies of
commodity exporters including Brazil and Australia gained.  
 “People were fearing it would be much worse,”  Sebastien Galy , a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, said
of the payrolls data. “The first reaction is one of relief.”  
 The Australian currency gained after the nation’s prime
minister,  Julia Gillard , scaled back a proposed tax on mining
companies to win their support, easing concern economic growth
will slow and depriving the opposition of a key election
platform.  
 “The mining tax announcement offered respite for high-
yielding currencies and weighed on the yen,” said  Neil Mellor ,
a strategist at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. in London.  
 The Aussie rose as much as 0.9 percent to 85.11 U.S. cents
before erasing gains.  
 ‘Relief Rally’  
 The euro rose for a third day against the dollar. A break
by the single currency above the $1.26 level, its first since
May 21, could signal a further rise to $1.2675, according to
 Carl Forcheski , a director on the corporate currency sales desk
in New York at Societe Generale SA.  
 “We might see a minor relief rally,” Forcheski said in a
telephone interview. “It may be getting back to a little bit of
normalcy.”  
 Canada’s dollar weakened versus its U.S. counterpart as
traders trimmed bets the nation’s central bank will raise
interest rates at its meeting this month amid signs the North
American recovery may be faltering.  
 The Canadian currency slipped 0.3 percent to C$1.0631 per
U.S. dollar, trading near the weakest level in almost a month.
