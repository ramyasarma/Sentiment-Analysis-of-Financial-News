             Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said
a man arrested yesterday trying to enter the country was an
explosives expert on a mission to assassinate him.  
 Francisco Antonio Chavez Abarca of El Salvador is wanted by
Interpol and was trying to use fake documents, Chavez said on
 state television . Abarca has ties to  Luis Posada Carriles , whom
Cuba accuses of bombing a Cuban airliner in 1976, Chavez said.  
 “This guy didn’t come here for tourism, he came to set a
bomb,” Chavez said. “My head has a price and there are people
willing to pay. What did this well-trained terrorist come to do
in Venezuela?”  
 Chavez, who’s allied with former Cuban President  Fidel Castro , has denounced alleged assassination plans against him in
the past and was briefly overthrown in a coup in 2002. He has
joined with Cuba to demand the U.S. extradite Posada Carriles,
who was also convicted in a Panama plot to assassinate Castro in
2000.  
 Abarca will be interrogated and handed over to Interpol,
who will send him to Cuba to face terrorism charges, Chavez
said.  
 “He came to kill me,” Chavez said. “They wouldn’t send
such a high-level terrorist to risk his secrets if it weren’t an
important mission.”  
 Phone calls to El Salvador’s embassy in Caracas seeking
information about Abarca weren’t answered.
