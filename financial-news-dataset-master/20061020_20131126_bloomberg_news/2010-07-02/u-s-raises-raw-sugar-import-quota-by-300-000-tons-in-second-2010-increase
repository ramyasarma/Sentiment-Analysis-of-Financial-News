             The U.S. Department of Agriculture is
raising its raw-sugar import quota by 300,000 short tons, the
second increase this year, to relieve a shortage of the domestic
sweetener used by companies including  PepsiCo Inc.   
 Overseas producers will be allowed to ship 1.731 million
short tons (1.571 million metric tons) of sugar to the U.S. in
the year ending Sept. 30, the USDA said today in a statement
posted on the Federal Register’s  website . U.S. production is not
sufficient to meet national sweetener needs, the department
said.  
 “Additional supplies of raw cane sugar are required in the
U.S. market,” the department said. “USDA will closely monitor
stocks, consumption, imports and all sugar market and program
variables on an ongoing bases, and may make further program
adjustments.”  
 The USDA in April boosted the quota by 16 percent to 1.471
million short tons after retail prices surged to a record.
Today’s notice will be officially placed in the Federal Register
on July 6.  
 Sugar is the only major agricultural commodity produced in
the U.S. that is subject to import quotas. The limits were
established to benefit domestic growers. In 2008, Mexico became
exempt under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
