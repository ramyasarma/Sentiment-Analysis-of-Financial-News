             Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , donated $1.6 billion in his
annual gift to the foundation established by Bill Gates.  
 The value of the July 1 donation, which was made in
 Berkshire Class B stock , rose about 28 percent from $1.25
billion last year, according to a regulatory filing today. The
number of shares given fell 5 percent to 20.4 million, when last
year’s count is adjusted to reflect a 50-for-1 share split. In
the 12 months, Berkshire has gained about a third.  
 Buffett, 79, is giving away a personal fortune that was
estimated at $47 billion by Forbes magazine in March. Four years
ago, he pledged most of his wealth to the  Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation , which combats global hunger and funds U.S. education
initiatives. This year’s gift is Buffett’s biggest since the
$1.8 billion he gave in 2008.  
 “Buffett’s gift to the Gates Foundation is one of the most
transformative events in philanthropy in the last decade,” said
 Melissa Berman , president and chief executive officer of
Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors in New York.  
 The  Class B shares  slipped $1.57, or 2 percent, to $77.24
at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has gained about 18 percent this year. The value of the
gift was calculated from yesterday’s closing price of $78.81.
 Buffett’s filing  didn’t contain a dollar total.  
 Other Donations  
 Buffett also donated $160 million in shares to the Susan
Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his first wife, who died
in 2004. The billionaire gave $56 million of stock to each of
his three children’s charities.  
 Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, had net income last
year of $8.06 billion, a 61 percent increase from 2008. In
February, Buffett completed the biggest takeover of his career,
the $27 billion purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa
Fe Corp.  
 Buffett and Bill Gates, co-founder of  Microsoft Corp.  and
world’s second-richest man behind Mexico’s  Carlos Slim , are
pressing fellow billionaires to give more. On June 16, the two
men and Gates’s wife  Melinda Gates  announced a campaign called
“ The Giving Pledge ” to induce the wealthiest individuals and
couples to commit half their fortunes to charity.  
 Gates, 54, is a Berkshire director.
