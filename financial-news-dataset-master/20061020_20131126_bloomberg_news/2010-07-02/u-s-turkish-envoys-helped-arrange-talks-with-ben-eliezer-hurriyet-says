             U.S. Ambassador to Turkey James 
Jeffrey and Feridun Sinirlioglu, a former Turkish envoy to 
Israel, helped organize a meeting between Turkish and Israeli 
ministers two days ago, Hurriyet said.  
 An Israeli businessman was also involved in the 
preparations for the talks between Turkish Foreign Minister 
 Ahmet Davutoglu  and Israel’s Industry and Trade Minister 
 Binyamin Ben-Eliezer  in Brussels, the Istanbul-based newspaper 
reported without saying where it got the information.  
 Defense Minister  Ehud Barak  was aware of the plans for the 
meeting, which was aimed at repairing ties ruptured when 
Israel’s military killed nine Turkish activists aboard an aid 
ship bound for the Gaza strip, Hurriyet said. Special care was 
taken by Barak and Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office 
to ensure Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman was kept unaware 
of the process, it said.
