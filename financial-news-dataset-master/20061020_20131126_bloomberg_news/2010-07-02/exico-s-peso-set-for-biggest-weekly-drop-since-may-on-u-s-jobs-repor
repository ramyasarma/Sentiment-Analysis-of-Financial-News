             Mexico’s peso is headed to its
biggest weekly drop since May as private hiring in the U.S., the
nation’s largest trading partner, grew less than forecast.  
 The currency dropped 3.3 percent to 13.0866 per dollar at
9:04 a.m. New York time, from 12.6490 on June 25. The peso fell
0.6 percent today, the fifth day of declines. It dropped 4.3
percent in the week ended May 7.  
 “The U.S. employment data has implications for Mexican
manufacturing exports,” said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with
Banco Santander SA in Mexico City. “The market was waiting all
week for the employment data.”  
 Employment in the U.S. fell for the first time this year in
June, the Labor Department said today. The U.S. buys about 80
percent of Mexico’s exports. Employment at companies rose
83,000, less than the 110,000 forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
50 economists.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.28 percent
today, according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the
security fell 0.24 centavo to 124.23 centavos per peso.
