             The International Monetary Fund
approved a one-year, $20.4 billion credit line to Poland, money
the country’s officials intend to treat as “precautionary”
after similar financing expired in May.  
 The so-called Flexible Credit Line, which comes with no
conditions for economies deemed sound enough to qualify, is also
used by Colombia and Mexico. Poland sought it last year as a
backup to calm markets and reduce extra yield demanded by
investors to hold Polish assets.  
 “Poland’s very strong policy frameworks and economic
fundamentals, together with the additional insurance provided by
the successor arrangement under the FCL, put Poland in a very
strong position to deal with potential risks and pressures in
the event that external conditions deteriorate,” IMF First
Deputy Managing Director  John Lipsky  said in a statement.  
 Poland, whose previous credit line expired on May 5, has
said it doesn’t plan to use it.  
 “The credit line is less a case of buying insurance than
it is of installing good locks on the doors,” Finance Minister
 Jacek Rostowski  said at a June 16 press conference in Warsaw.  
 Poland would activate the credit line “if we had a serious
attack on the zloty or a sharp depreciation of the currency,”
Rostowski said. “But these problems are less likely because
everybody on the market knows that we have this access.”
