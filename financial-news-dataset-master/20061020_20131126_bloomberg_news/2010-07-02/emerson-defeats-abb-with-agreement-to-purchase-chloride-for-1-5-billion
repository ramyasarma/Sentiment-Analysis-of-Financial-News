             Emerson Electric Co. won support from
Chloride Group Plc for its $1.5 billion takeover offer after
derailing ABB Ltd.’s planned acquisition of Britain’s largest
maker of backup power equipment.  
 Emerson raised its offer to 375 pence a share, or 997
million pounds, from an earlier proposal of 275 pence, outlined
in April. Zurich-based ABB, which had bid 325 pence a share,
relinquished its right to match Emerson’s offer yesterday.  
 Chloride Chairman  Norman Broadhurst , who had previously
spurned two prior approaches from Emerson, said it would be in
the best interests of shareholders to recommend the latest offer
from the St. Louis-based company.  
 “Chloride and Emerson will represent a powerful
combination in the global secure power market,” Chloride Chief
Executive Officer  Tim Cobbold  said in the statement.
