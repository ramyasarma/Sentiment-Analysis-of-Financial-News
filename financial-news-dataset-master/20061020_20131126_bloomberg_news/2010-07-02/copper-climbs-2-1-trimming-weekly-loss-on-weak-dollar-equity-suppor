             Copper climbed, trimming a third
weekly loss in six, as a weakening dollar and a gain in equities
offset concern about a slowdown in global recovery.  
 Three-month delivery copper rose as much as 2.9 percent to
$6,513 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and traded at
$6,500 at 3:19 p.m. in Shanghai. The contract has lost almost 4
percent this week. Aluminum increased 1.5 percent to $1,954 a
ton and zinc jumped 3.8 percent to $1,806.  
 The dollar fell on an index against six major counterparts
as data showed U.S. manufacturing weakened and economists
forecast a report today will say payrolls shrank. Commodities,
priced in the dollar, usually move counter to the currency.
Asian stocks gained today, led by commodity producers, after
Australia’s government reached an agreement with mining
companies on a resources tax.  
 “Metal prices are resistant to falls in the short term due
to support from the dollar and equities,” said  Wang Kang , an
analyst at Citics Futures Co. from Shanghai. Still, “they’re
weak in the long run as the market refocuses on a possible
double-dip in the global economy.”  
 Manufacturing in China and the U.S., the world’s largest
metals consumers, both expanded at a slower pace in June, data
showed this week. Copper, used in construction and home
appliances, touched an eight-month low of $6,037.50 on June 7,
on signs growing budget deficits from Greece to Spain may stunt
the global economic recovery.  
 Copper for October delivery gained as much as 2.5 percent
to 52,320 yuan ($7,721) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
and closed at 52,200 yuan. Shanghai aluminum rose 1.2 percent to
14,775 yuan and zinc jumped 4.2 percent to 15,105 yuan.  
 Lower Fees  
 BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, may
win a reduction in mid-year copper processing fees, research
company  Brook Hunt  said in a report to clients this week. LS-
Nikko Copper Inc. denied the report that said it settled the
fees at $39 a ton for smelting and 3.9 cents a pound for
refining for the contract year that begins July 1, while BHP
declined to comment.  
 Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  reached an
agreement with mining companies on a new resources tax. The tax
will be 30 percent, applying to iron ore and coal, while the
levy on oil and gas projects will be 40 percent, the government
said. Gillard’s predecessor  Kevin Rudd  had proposed a 40 percent
tax on all resources.  
 “It will be very positive for the equities not involved, the
copper, gold and nickel miners,” said Peter Strachan, a Perth-
based analyst for independent advisory company StockAnalysis.
“It shouldn’t have any impact on commodity prices. In five
years time, it will mean commodities will be better supplied
than they would otherwise.”  
 Lead for three-month delivery in London added 1.8 percent
to $1,766 a ton, nickel advanced 2 percent to $19,375 a ton and
tin climbed 1.7 percent to $17,250 a ton.
