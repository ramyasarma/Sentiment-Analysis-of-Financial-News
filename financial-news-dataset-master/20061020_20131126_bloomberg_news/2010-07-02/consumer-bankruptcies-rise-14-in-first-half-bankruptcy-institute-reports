             U.S. consumer bankruptcy filings rose
14 percent to 770,117 in the first six months of 2010 from the
same period a year earlier, the American Bankruptcy Institute
reported.  
 “Years of rising consumer debt and low savings rates” are
pushing totals near the record set in 2005, when proposed
changes in bankruptcy law triggered a surge in filings, ABI
Executive Director  Samuel J. Gerdano  said in a statement.  
 By the end of the year, more than 1.6 million bankruptcies
will have been filed, Gerdano said. The number of filings each
month has declined since March, he said.  
 The information was based on data collected by the National
Bankruptcy Research Center.  
 Total U.S. payrolls declined by 125,000 last month as the
government cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010
census, according to a U.S. Labor Department report issued
today.  
 Employment at private companies rose 83,000, less than the
110,000 gain forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The overall drop in payrolls was the first decline this year.
The  jobless rate  dropped to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent as the
labor force shrank.
