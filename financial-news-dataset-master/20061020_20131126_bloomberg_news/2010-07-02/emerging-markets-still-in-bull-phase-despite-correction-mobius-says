             Emerging markets are still in a
“bull phase” after the benchmark index for stocks fell 13
percent from this year’s high, according to Templeton Asset
Management Ltd.’s Mark Mobius.  
 The “correction” in shares will last “a little while”
and give investors opportunities to buy cheaper stocks, Mobius
said today in Paris.
