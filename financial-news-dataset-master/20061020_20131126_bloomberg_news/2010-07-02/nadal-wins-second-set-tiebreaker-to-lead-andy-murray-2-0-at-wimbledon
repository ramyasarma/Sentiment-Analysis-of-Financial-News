             World No. 1 Rafael Nadal took the
first two sets of his Wimbledon semifinal with Andy Murray.  
 Nadal won the first set 6-3 and the second 7-6 (8-6). He
took the first set even after Murray had five aces and the
Spaniard had none. In the second, the Scot couldn’t take two
break points at 4-3, allowing Nadal to escape and tie the set.
It went to the tiebreaker, where Nadal benefited from shot that
hit the top of the net and passed Murray.  
 The winner of the match will face Tomas Berdych, who
defeated third-seeded Novak Djokovic in straight sets to reach
the final.
