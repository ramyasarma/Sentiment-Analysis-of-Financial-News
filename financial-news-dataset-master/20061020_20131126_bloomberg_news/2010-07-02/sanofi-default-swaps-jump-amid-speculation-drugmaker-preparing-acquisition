             The cost of protecting  Sanofi-Aventis
SA  debt from default rose to the highest in more than a year on
speculation that France’s biggest drugmaker is preparing a major
acquisition in the U.S.  
 Credit-default swaps on the Paris-based company increased
10 basis points to 77, according to CMA DataVision in London. In
the broader market, the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps
on 50 mostly high-yield European companies declined 16.1 basis
points to 571.9 at 1:51 p.m. in London, Markit Group Ltd. prices
show.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Chris Viehbacher  briefed Sanofi’s
board on the transaction at a special meeting this week, said
two people with knowledge of the situation, who declined to be
identified because the plan is confidential. He wants to replace
revenue the company is losing as its medicines face competition
from lower-priced generic drugs.  
 Sanofi is talking with lenders to secure 6 billion euros
($7.5 billion) of loans to replace its existing lines, spokesman
 Jean-Marc Podvin  said June 14.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe index of default swaps on 125
companies with investment-grade ratings dropped 3.5 basis points
to 128.1. This and the junk bond index are benchmark for the
cost of protecting bonds against default and a decline indicates
improvements in the perception of credit quality.  
 The company bond-risk gauges pared their declines after a
U.S. government report showed that the world’s largest economy
shed jobs in June for the first time this year.  
 Payrolls Decline  
 Payrolls declined by 125,000 last month as the government
cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010 census, Labor
Department figures in Washington showed today. Economists
projected a decline of 130,000 payrolls, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Employment at companies
rose 83,000. The jobless rate fell to 9.5 percent from 9.7
percent as the U.S. labor force shrank.  
 Credit-default swaps on  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Rio Tinto
Group dropped after the Australian government watered down a new
tax on mining profits. Contracts tied to BHP’s bonds fell 5.5
basis points to 87.5, while swaps on Rio Tinto declined 6 basis
points to 131, according to CMA.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
