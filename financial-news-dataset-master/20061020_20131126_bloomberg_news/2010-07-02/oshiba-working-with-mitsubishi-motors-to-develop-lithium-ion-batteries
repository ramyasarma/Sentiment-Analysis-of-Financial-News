             Toshiba Corp. , a Japanese
electronics and power equipment maker, said it is working
with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. to develop lithium-ion batteries
for possible use in the automaker’s electric cars.  
 Mitsubishi Motors hasn’t decided whether to use the
batteries, said Yuki Murata, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based
carmaker. A Nikkei newspaper report today that Toshiba would
supply a jointly produced battery is “speculation,” he said.  
 Competition is intensifying among Japanese electronics
makers to supply batteries to automakers, which are switching
to electric and hybrid cars. Shares of  GS Yuasa Corp. , which
has a partnership with Mitsubishi to make lithium-ion cells
for its electric cars, fell after the report.  
 GS Yuasa dropped 6.7 percent to 545 yen as of the 11 a.m.
break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Kyoto-based company’s
biggest decline since Nov. 24.  Toshiba  rose 1.4 percent to
445 yen, while the benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained
0.5 percent.  
 Toshiba has been developing the batteries for a year and
will decide with Mitsubishi Motors whether to use them after
final tests are conducted, said spokesman  Ken Shinjo . He
declined to say when the tests would occur.
