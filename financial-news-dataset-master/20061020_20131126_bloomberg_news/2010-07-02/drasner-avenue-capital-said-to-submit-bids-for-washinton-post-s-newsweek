             Media executive  Fred Drasner  and
investment firm Avenue Capital Group submitted separate offers
to purchase Newsweek magazine ahead of yesterday’s deadline for
final offers, according to two people close to the process.  
 Drasner, a former executive at U.S. News & World Report and
The New York Daily News, made his bid shortly before the 5 p.m.
New York time deadline on Thursday, according to one of the
people. Avenue Capital, which specializes in distressed assets,
submitted a rival offer for the weekly magazine, which is being
sold by  Washington Post Co. , the other person said.  
 OpenGate Capital LLC, the private equity firm that in 2008
bought TV Guide, said earlier it was interested in acquiring
Newsweek.  Andrew Nikou , a managing partner at OpenGate, didn’t
return phone calls yesterday seeking comment.  
 Rima Calderon , a spokeswoman for  Donald Graham , chairman of
the Washington Post Co., said the company “will not have
anything to say for weeks” concerning the bidding process.  Tom Kuhn , managing director at investment bank Allen & Co., which
was hired by Post Co. to manage the sale, declined to comment.  
 Since 2007, Newsweek has lost $44 million on an operating
basis, according to documents sent to prospective buyers that
Bloomberg News reported on last month. Print advertising revenue
plunged 39 percent to $70.3 million last year from $115.5
million in 2008, the documents show.  
 Newsmax Media Inc., a West Palm Beach, Florida-based
publisher, issued a statement saying it had “made a serious bid
to acquire Newsweek” but wouldn’t be a participant in the final
bid process.  
 Ritchie Capital Management LLC Chief Executive Officer
 Thane Ritchie , who last year sought to buy Sun-Times Media Group
Inc., also withdrew from the bidding process, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing a spokesman for Ritchie. Ritchie didn’t
respond to e-mails seeking comment.
