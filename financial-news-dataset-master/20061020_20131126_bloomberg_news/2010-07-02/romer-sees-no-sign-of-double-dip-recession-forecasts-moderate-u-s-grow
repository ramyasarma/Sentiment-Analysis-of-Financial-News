             The U.S. economy doesn’t show signs
that it will relapse into another recession, said Christina
Romer, President Barack Obama’s chief economist.  
 “We certainly do not see any sign of that in the data,”
said Romer, who chairs the White House’s Council of Economic
Advisers, in an interview on Bloomberg Television today. “We’re
anticipating moderate growth.”  
 The U.S. economy lost 125,000 workers in June while adding
83,000 private-sector jobs, according to Labor Department data
released earlier today. Private employers hired fewer workers
than forecast, and overall payrolls fell because of a drop in
federal census workers.  
 “It’s not good enough but it is very much in the direction
of slow steady expansion,” Romer said. She said Obama would
keep “plugging away” to encourage Congress to approve extended
unemployment benefits and aid for small business and local
governments.
