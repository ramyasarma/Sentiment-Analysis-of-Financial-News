             Siam Cement Pcl , Thailand’s third-
biggest company by market value, said the start up of a new $1.2
billion petrochemical plant will help it maintain profit growth
this year.  
 “With the new cracker, we triple the size of high-margin
petrochemical products,” Siam Cement President  Kan Trakulhoon 
said in Bangkok. Petrochemicals produced at the plant, including
ethylene and propylene, have “healthy profit margins,” he said,
declining to elaborate.  
 Siam Cement has increased investments in petrochemical
plants in Thailand and Vietnam to help counter a slowdown in
domestic sales of cement, ceramic tiles and other building
materials. Demand for chemicals used to make plastics has surged
as economic growth in China and the rest of Asia spurs sales of
cars, electrical appliances and other consumer products.  
 The company began testing the plant in the first half of
this year, running the facility at about 70 percent of capacity,
Kan said in an interview on June 30. The plant can produce 1.7
million metric tons of ethylene and propylene a year, he said.  
 Siam Cement’s first-quarter  profit  jumped 32 percent to
6.86 billion baht ($212 million). The company’s shares have
gained 12 percent this year, compared with an 8.8 percent rise
in Thailand’s benchmark  SET Index . The stock added 0.4 percent
to 263 baht as of the 12:30 p.m. lunch break.  
 Siam Cement owns 67 percent of the new plant, with the
remainder owned by  Dow Chemical Co.   
 Vietnam Expansion  
 The company, founded by Thai King Vajiravudh in 1913 and
controlled by present monarch  Bhumibol Adulyadej ’s asset-
management arm, has businesses ranging from cement and
petrochemicals to paper and building materials.  
 Siam Cement and its partners may fund a petrochemical plant
in Vietnam themselves because of a delay in securing project
financing, Kan said.  
 “We want to speed up the project,” he said. “The project
finance is taking a long time. We are talking among shareholders
about financing. I believe we are going to finalize the
agreement among shareholders in the next few months.”  
 The plan to build Vietnam’s biggest petrochemical plant,
announced in March 2008 with total investment of as much as $4
billion, was stalled by the global credit crisis, he said.  
 Siam Cement, Qatar Petroleum and Vietnam’s government are
building the petrochemical complex in the southern province of
Ba Ria Vung Tau to meet rising demand for plastics in the
Southeast Asian nation. The plant will have annual capacity of
1.4 million tons of olefins, the company said in November.  
 The Thai company also plans to build a new cement plant in
Indonesia and acquire a cement maker in Vietnam, he said.
