             Nintendo Co. ’s DS and  Sony Corp. ’s
PlayStation Portable handheld players led a 4.9 percent decline
in U.S. video-game sales to $823.5 million in May, according to
market researcher NPD Group Inc.  
 Sales of the touch-screen DS fell 39 percent from a year
earlier to 383,700 units, the lowest since January 2008, while
PSP sales declined 41 percent to 59,400 units, NPD said in a
statement yesterday. Overall sales of video-game hardware
slumped 20 percent to $241.5 million in May, it said.  
 “The portable hardware category contributed the most to
the decline in hardware sales for the month,” NPD analyst  Anita Frazier  said in the statement. Nintendo DS maintained its
position as the market’s best-selling machine, Frazier said.  
 Portable game players are facing increasing competition
from  Apple Inc. ’s iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, as consumers look
to devices that connect to the Internet and allow downloads of
music, video and applications. Nintendo is introducing a new
 version  of the DS, equipped with three cameras, a wireless
connection and a screen that displays 3-D images without the use
of specialized glasses.  
 The Kyoto-based company sold 334,800 Wii consoles in the
U.S. in May, a 16 percent gain from a year earlier, NPD said.
Sales of Sony’s PlayStation 3 rose 18 percent to 154,500 units
in May, while those of  Microsoft Corp. ’s Xbox 360 climbed 11
percent to 194,600 units.  
 Nintendo gained 0.8 percent to 26,390 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break on the Osaka Securities Exchange, while  Sony  rose
1 percent to 2,318 yen in Tokyo.  Microsoft  advanced 0.7 percent
to close at $23.16 in New York trading yesterday.  
 Software Sales Rise  
 Apple’s newest model of the iPhone sold 1.7 million units
in the first three days after its debut in the U.S., U.K., Japan,
France and Germany on June 24, the Cupertino, California-based
company said this week. The sales results follow Apple’s earlier
announcement that more than 3 million of its iPad tablet
computer were sold in the first 80 days since it was first
offered on April 3.  
 “Red Dead Redemption,” from “Grand Theft Auto” maker
 Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.,  held the top two spots for
game titles with versions for the Xbox and PS3, Port Washington,
New York-based NPD said. Industry software sales rose 4 percent
to $466.3 million.
