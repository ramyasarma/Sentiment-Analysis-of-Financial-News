             India is “open” to reviewing its
policy to consider allowing overseas airlines to own stakes in
local carriers, the nation’s Civil Aviation Minister  Praful Patel  said.  
 The government will hold inter-ministerial consultations to
evaluate any change in the rules, Patel said in New Delhi today,
without specifying a timeline. India plans to review the laws
regarding airline ownership as growth in Asia’s third-biggest
economy spurs rising demand for air travel and carriers seek
funds for expansion.  
 While foreign investors can own stakes in Indian airlines,
India more than a decade ago banned overseas carriers from
buying into rivals in the world’s second-most populous nation.
The government estimates an annual 10 percent growth in domestic
air passengers, with as many as 180 million traveling by 2020.  
 Indian companies including  Jet Airways Ltd . and  Kingfisher 
Airlines Ltd. have been seeking money for expansion.  
 Jet Airways Chairman  Naresh Goyal  said in February the
airline intends to raise as much as $400 million to help pay for
new planes and cut debt. Kingfisher Airlines plans to raise more
than $100 million selling global depository receipts,  Ravi Nedungadi , chief financial officer of UB Group, the airline’s
parent, said on April 7.  
 India’s government in the past decade has been easing
limits on overseas ownership in local businesses and simplifying
rules to attract more money from abroad.
