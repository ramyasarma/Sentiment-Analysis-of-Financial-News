             U.S. stocks erased gains as declines
in technology and consumer companies tempered an early advance
triggered by a government report showing growth in private
payrolls.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1 percent to
1,028.47 at 9:53 a.m. in New after climbing as much as 0.5
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.68
points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 9,729.85.
