             The New York Knicks offered free-
agent forward  Amar’e Stoudemire  a $100 million contract,
according to the New York Times.  
 The offer for Stoudemire, with whom the National Basketball
Association team has yet to meet since free agency began
yesterday, is the maximum allowed, the  newspaper said , citing a
person involved in the talks who requested anonymity because he
was disclosing private negotiations. Teams may not sign players
or discuss possible contracts publicly until July 8, and a
meeting in New York may come as early as July 4, the Times said.  
 The Knicks met yesterday with free agent  LeBron James  in
Cleveland and are one of six clubs seeking to sign the two-time
NBA Most Valuable Player. Gaining Stoudemire’s agreement may be
a first step in the team’s plan to land James.  
 Stoudemire, 27, played his first eight seasons with the
Phoenix Suns, averaging 21.4 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.4
blocked shots per game. The 27-year-old broke off negotiations
today with the Suns, who quickly agreed to terms with power
forward  Hakim Warrick , likely signaling the end of Stoudemire’s
career in Phoenix, the Times said.
