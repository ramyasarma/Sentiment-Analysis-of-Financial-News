Member Juergen Stark said the euro region needs an independent
supervisory watchdog to depoliticize supervision.  
 A breach of the stability and growth pact rules should be
“automatically” followed by “credible” sanctions such as the
revocation of European Union structural funds, subsidies or
voting rights, Stark said in a speech in Vienna today. The
sanctions should also intensify the longer rules are broken, he
said.
