             North General Hospital , a community
hospital based in New York’s Harlem neighborhood, filed for
bankruptcy protection with plans to close.  
 North General filed for bankruptcy to wind down operations,
it said in court papers filed today in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Manhattan. The board of directors approved the hospital’s
closure earlier this week, it said.  
 “North General has and remains simply too small and its
inpatient volumes too low for it to carry the financial
obligations it has incurred,” it said.  
 A 190-bed hospital founded in 1979, North General also
blamed its financial problems on changes to Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursements. It has faced “insurmountable financial
obstacles” since its opening, it said in court papers.  
 The hospital had $293 million in debt as of May 31,
including $135 million in mortgage debt, according to its court
filing. Total assets were $67 million.  
 A lawyer for the hospital, Charles Simpson, declined to
comment on the bankruptcy filing.  
 North General will begin its wind-down process by today,
according to a statement earlier this week from the hospital and
New York Governor  David Paterson . The Institute for Family
Health will take over primary-care services at the hospital, and
the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. will operate a
skilled-nursing facility and a long-term acute-care facility
there, according to the release.  
 The case is In re North General Hospital 10-13553, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
