             MAN SE , Europe’s third-largest
truckmaker, extended Chief Executive Officer  Georg Pachta- Reyhofen ’s contract to 2016, as shareholder Volkswagen AG seeks
to tighten ties between the company and its Scania AB unit.  
 Pachta-Reyhofen’s tenure, which was due to expire in mid-
2011, was extended due to his “hard work in the best interests
of both the company and its employees,” the Munich-based
manufacturer said today in a statement. MAN’s supervisory board
is chaired by Volkswagen Chairman  Ferdinand Piech .  
 Pachta-Reyhofen, 55, took the helm following the sudden
departure of Hakan Samuelsson in November. MAN is 29.9 percent-
owned by VW, which aims to improve cooperation between the two
companies. The truckmakers, which could save as much as 1
billion euros by working together, according to Piech, are in
talks “at the highest level,” Pachta-Reyhofen said in April.  
 Volkswagen planned to name  Jochem Heizmann , the automaker’s
production chief, to spearhead the cooperation effort, two
people familiar with the matter said in April. MAN in June
denied a Bild report that Heizmann would replace Pachta-
Reyhofen.  
 The executive, who joined MAN in 1986, led engineering at
the truck unit before taking charge of MAN’s diesel engine unit
in 2006.
