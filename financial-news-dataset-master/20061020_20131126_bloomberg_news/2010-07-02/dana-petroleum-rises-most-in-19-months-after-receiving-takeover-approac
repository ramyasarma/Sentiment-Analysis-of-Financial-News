             Dana Petroleum Plc , a U.K. oil and
gas explorer, surged the most in 19 months in London trading
after a takeover approach from  Korea National Oil Corp.   
 The shares  climbed  22 percent to 1,440 pence in London, in
the biggest one-day gain since November 2008, valuing Dana at
1.3 billion pounds ($2 billion).  
 “KNOC confirms that it is in very preliminary discussions
regarding a possible cash offer,” the Korean state explorer
said in a statement today. “There can be no certainty that any
offer will ultimately be made.”  
 KNOC, as the Korean company is known, plans to spend about
$6 billion on acquisitions and projects this year in an effort
to more than double output by 2012. Dana, based in Aberdeen,
Scotland, holds more than 100 interests in exploration and
production licenses in nine countries.  
 “If the shares reach 1,500 pence today we would recommend
selling on the grounds that it’s far from certain the deal will
go through,”  Richard Griffith , an analyst at Evolution
Securities Ltd.  
 Dana “isn’t for sale,” Chief Executive Officer  Tom Cross 
said last year. He said he planned to boost the company’s market
value by finding more oil and gas.  
 In June,  Dana  agreed to buy Suncor Energy Inc.’s Dutch
North Sea assets for 328 million euros ($410 million) in cash in
its biggest purchase to date.  
 The acquisition will boost Dana’s previous  production 
estimate for this year by as much as 12 percent, the company
said. Output will increase by as much as 9,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2011 and 14,000 barrels in 2012. It will
also add 31 million barrels of proved and probable reserves.  
 Dana reported a “significant” gas discovery in the U.K.
southern North Sea in April.
