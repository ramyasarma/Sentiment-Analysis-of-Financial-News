             Reinsurance rates in Chile have
surged since the world’s fifth-strongest earthquake in a century
struck the country, attracting more carriers to the market.  
 Prices for reinsurance against catastrophic losses to
property rose as much as 65 percent since the Feb. 27 quake, Aon
Corp., the industry’s largest broker, said in a  report 
yesterday. Because of the rate increases, “capacity has been
plentiful,” Chicago-based Aon said.  
 The earthquake and a subsequent tsunami killed more than
400 people, toppled bridges and closed factories and ports in an
area of the country that provides 17 percent of Chile’s gross
domestic product. Insurers and reinsurers led by Munich Re and
Swiss Reinsurance Co. have said the quake would cost them a
combined total of more than $6 billion.  
 “Reinsurers have really been enlightened about Chile and
now realize it is a more seismically active territory,” said
 David Flandro , head of global business intelligence at Guy
Carpenter & Co., a unit of brokerage Marsh & McLennan Cos. He
said he expects losses from the earthquake to rise as more
damage is discovered.  
 Chile’s earthquake could cost insurance companies as much
as $9 billion, said analyst  Amit Kumar  of Macquarie Capital USA
Inc., who said he discussed Chilean rates with reinsurance
companies last week in Bermuda. Global reinsurance capacity is
close to $450 billion, he said. Reinsurance contracts, which
provide backup coverage to primary carriers, are often renewed
on June 30 and Dec. 31 of each year.  
 ‘Important and Necessary’  
 The rate adjustments were “important and necessary” for
the industry, said Rolf Steiner, a region head of  Swiss Re , the
world’s second-biggest reinsurer, with responsibilities in South
America. “Such adjustments are beneficial not only due to
potential aftershock activity in the next years, but also given
the volatile environment in the financial markets and low
interest rates.”  
 Munich Re, Swiss Re and  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., the world’s three largest reinsurers, have said the quake
will cost them a combined total of more than $1.5 billion.
Hurricane Katrina, the most costly natural disaster in U.S.
history, with more than $70 billion in insured losses, brought
capital to existing carriers and led to the creation of new ones
such as Harbor Point Ltd. and  Validus Holdings Ltd.   
 Wall Street formed the so called Class of 2005 with $35
billion of new capital after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma
that year boosted the price of coverage.  
 Chile is one of the only places rates went up at the
midyear renewal season, according to a  report  this week from the
reinsurance broking arm of  Willis Group Holdings Plc .  
 Insurance premiums were 4.1 percent of Chile’s gross
domestic product in 2008, equal to Norway and higher than the
average 2.5 percent of GDP for nations in Latin America and the
Caribbean, according to 2008 data from Swiss Re.
