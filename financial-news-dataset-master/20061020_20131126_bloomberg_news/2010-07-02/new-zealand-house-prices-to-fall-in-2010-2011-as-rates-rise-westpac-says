             New Zealand  house prices  are likely
to fall this year and next as interest rates rise and population
growth slows, according to Westpac Banking Corp.  
 Prices will decline about 2 percent in 2010 and the same in
2011, Wellington-based Chief Economist  Brendan O’Donovan  and
Senior Economist  Dominick Stephens  said in an e-mailed report.
Prices rose 6.4 percent last year.  
 Central bank Governor  Alan Bollard  last month raised the
 official cash rate  for the first time in three years and said he
intends to gradually remove stimulus as economic growth picks up.
Annual immigration slowed for a fourth straight month in May,
curbing demand for houses, according to government figures.  
 “Bugging the market has been rising interest rates,
impending tax changes and slowing population growth,” Westpac
said. “The positive vibe of an improving economy has not been
enough to counterbalance these negatives.”  
 House  sales  are also likely to be subdued because “people
are less likely to upgrade their house or get into property when
prices are flat or falling,” it said.  
 Income-tax cuts effective Oct. 1 will reduce the tax-
shelter value of owning real estate and, alongside the removal
of depreciation allowances, may prompt investors to sell
properties, Westpac said. This may be more apparent for cheaper
homes where price falls may be more pronounced, it said.
