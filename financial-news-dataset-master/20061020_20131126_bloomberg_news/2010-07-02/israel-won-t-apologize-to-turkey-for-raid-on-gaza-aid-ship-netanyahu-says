             Israel won’t apologize to Turkey for
its May 31 raid on an aid flotilla heading for the Gaza Strip in
which nine Turkish pro-Palestinian activists were killed, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late today in an interview with
Israel’s Channel One.  
 “Israel cannot apologize because Israel’s soldiers tried
to defend themselves” against the being “massacred,”
Netanyahu said.  
 The incident has severely strained Israel’s political and
military ties with Turkey, once its closest ally in the region.
Turkey is demanding that Israel make a formal apology, pay
compensation and agree to an international inquiry. Israel has
begun its own civilian and military inquiries into the incident.
