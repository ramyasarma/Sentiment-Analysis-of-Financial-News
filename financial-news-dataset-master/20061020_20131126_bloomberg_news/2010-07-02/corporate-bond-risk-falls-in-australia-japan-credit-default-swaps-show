             The cost of protecting Australian and
Japanese corporate bonds from default declined, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 1 basis point to
137.5 basis points as of 9:42 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Nomura Holdings Inc. The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5
basis points to 140.5 as of 8:57 a.m. in Tokyo, Morgan Stanley
prices show.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 141 basis points
as of 8:20 a.m. in Singapore, according to Barclays Plc.  
 All three indexes are on track for their highest weekly
closing levels since June 11, CMA DataVision prices show.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
