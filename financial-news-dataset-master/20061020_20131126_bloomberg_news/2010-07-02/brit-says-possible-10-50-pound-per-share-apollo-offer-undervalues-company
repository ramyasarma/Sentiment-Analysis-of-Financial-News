             Brit Insurance Holdings NV said
Apollo Global Management LLC’s possible revised indicative
proposal of 10.50 pounds per share undervalues the company and
“does not represent a basis on which the Board is prepared to
engage.”  
 Brit remains open to further engagement with Apollo, if it
was to put forward “an offer capable of recommendation,” the
company said.
