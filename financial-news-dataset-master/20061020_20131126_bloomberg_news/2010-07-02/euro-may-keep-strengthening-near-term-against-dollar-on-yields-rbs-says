             The euro may strengthen near term
against the dollar amid rising bond yields, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc said.  
 “In light of the rise in  euro-zone yields , a large degree
of the negativity on the banking sector now priced in, and the
prospect of stress tests to be revealed later this month, euro
could continue to strengthen near term,”  Greg Gibbs , a
strategist in Sydney, wrote today in a report. “We remain
bearish longer term, but it is time to be tactically square
against the dollar, and possibly long for more aggressive short-
term trading purposes.”  
 The euro slipped 0.3 percent to $1.2488 as of 7:55 a.m. in
London, on course for its third weekly gain in four.
