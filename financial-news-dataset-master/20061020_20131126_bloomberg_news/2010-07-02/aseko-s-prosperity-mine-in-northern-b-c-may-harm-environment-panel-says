             Taseko Mines Ltd. ’s proposed
Prosperity gold and copper mine in northern British Columbia
would cause “significant adverse environmental effects,” a
Canadian government panel said.  
 The project would harm fish habitat, navigation and land
use by Indian groups, the Canadian Environmental Assessment
Agency panel said in recommendations posted today on its
 website . The findings will be submitted to the Canadian minister
of the environment and other federal departments, the agency
said.  
 The proposed mine, 125 kilometers (78 miles) southwest of
Williams Lake in British Columbia, has a pretax net value of C$3
billion ($2.82 billion),  according  to Taseko’s website. The
Vancouver-based company was planning to begin construction in
the second quarter of next year.  
 The panel , which the environment minister established in
January 2009, conducted 30 days of hearings in 10 locations in
the area.  
 “We will require some time to understand the panel’s report
before we can make a statement,”  Brian Bergot , a Taseko
spokesman, said today in an e-mail.  
 Taseko fell 36 cents, or 8 percent, to C$4.16 today in
Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  have declined 6.5
percent this year.
