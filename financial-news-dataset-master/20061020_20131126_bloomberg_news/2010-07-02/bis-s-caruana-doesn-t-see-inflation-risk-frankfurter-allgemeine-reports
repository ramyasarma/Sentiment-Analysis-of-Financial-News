General Manager Jaime Caruana doesn’t see inflation pressures in
developed markets at the moment, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
reported, citing an interview.  
 He also doesn’t see a new “bubble” on markets, Caruana
said, according to the German newspaper. Banks need to keep
improving their balance sheets and corporate governance in areas
such as executive pay as the banking system is still
“fragile,” he also said.
