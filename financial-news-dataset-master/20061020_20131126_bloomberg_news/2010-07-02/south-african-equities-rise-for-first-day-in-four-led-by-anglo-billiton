             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  rose for the first time in four days, climbing
49.85, or 0.2 percent, to 26,059.38 at 12:04 p.m. in
Johannesburg, paring its drop this week to 4.4 percent.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, rallied 2.78 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 202 rand, heading
for its biggest gain since June 21.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ)
rose 2.79 rand, or 1 percent, to 269.80 rand. Copper climbed as
much as 3.2 percent to $6,535 a metric ton as a weakening dollar
and a gain in equities offset concern about a slowdown in global
recovery.  
 Separately, Australia’s Prime Minister  Julia Gillard 
reached a deal with mining companies on a proposed tax, lowering
the headline rate to 30 percent from 40 percent. BHP led a
campaign against the tax, which it said would slow investment.  
 Cie Financiere Richemont SA  (CFR SJ), the world’s second-
largest luxury-goods maker, dropped 15 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
25.87 rand, extending yesterday’s 3.1 percent slump before a
U.S. report that may show the world’s biggest economy lost jobs
last month for the first time this year.  
 Imperial Holdings Ltd.  (IPL SJ), the owner of auto
dealerships, rose 1.75 rand, or 2.1 percent, to 86.25 rand,
snapping three days of declines. South African vehicle sales
climbed an annual 20.7 percent in June after the central bank
cut interest rates for a seventh time and economic growth
accelerated, an industry group said.
