             Macquarie Group Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest investment bank, will merge its funds group with its
alternative asset management unit, creating a division
overseeing A$306 billion ($260 billion) in assets.  
 Shemara Wikramanayake  will lead the merged group, the
Sydney-based bank said in a statement today.  Roy Laidlaw  will
become group head of Macquarie Capital, the investment banking
unit, and Macquarie Securities, its brokerage business, the bank
said.  Michael Carapiet , currently head of Macquarie Capital,
becomes executive chairman of both units.  
 “Macquarie Capital and Macquarie Securities work very
closely together,” Laidlaw said. “These changes allow the two
businesses to provide greater support to our corporate and
institutional clients, particularly in newer markets.”  
 Macquarie  shares  fell 0.9 percent to A$36.14 at 3 p.m. in
Sydney trading, its ninth straight drop. Analysts have cut
 ratings and forecasts  for the stock after senior bankers quit
and Australia’s biggest investment bank said June 24 that
uncertain markets were weighing on some parts of the business
and short-term forecasting was “difficult.”
