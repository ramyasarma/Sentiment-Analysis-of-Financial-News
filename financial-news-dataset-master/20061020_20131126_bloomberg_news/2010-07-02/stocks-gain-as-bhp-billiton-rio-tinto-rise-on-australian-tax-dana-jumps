             U.K. stocks advanced, with the
benchmark FTSE 100 Index rebounding from a ten-month low, as
basic-resources companies rallied and Dana Petroleum Plc
received a takeover approach.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group led gains by mining
shares after Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  scaled back
a proposed tax on the industry. Dana surged 22 percent. Equities
held gains even after a report showed U.S. companies created
fewer jobs than economists had expected last month.  
 The  FTSE 100  rose 32.34, or 0.7 percent, to 4,838.09,
trimming the loss this week to 4.1 percent. The  FTSE All-Share
Index  gained 0.8 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Overall Index
rallied 1.7 percent.  
 The FTSE 100 declined 13 percent last quarter on concern a
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe is spreading and authorities in
China are moving to cool the world’s largest emerging economy.
Employment at U.S. companies rose 83,000 in June, missing the
110,000 jobs forecast in a poll of economists.  
 “Economic data is softening but maybe not as dramatically
as people had feared,” said  Mark Bon , who helps oversee about
$750 million at Canada Life Ltd. in London. “We’ve had a
negative run and once you get the news behind, it is difficult
to push it a bit further.”  
 Global Growth  
 Weaker-than-forecast data on American manufacturing and
home sales yesterday further worsened the outlook for global
growth and weighed on U.S. stocks.  
 The FTSE 100 yesterday closed at the lowest price relative
to expected earnings since March 18, 2009, according to
Bloomberg data. The  benchmark  index reached a six-year low on
March 3 last year before rallying 66 percent over the following
13 months.  
 Employment in the U.S. fell in June for the first time this
year, reflecting a drop in federal census workers and a smaller-
than-forecast gain in private hiring. Payrolls declined by
125,000 last month as the government cut 225,000 temporary
workers conducting the 2010 census, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed today. Economists projected a decline of
130,000 payrolls.  
 BHP  gained 1.7 percent to 1,723 pence. Rio Tinto advanced 1
percent to 2,934.5 pence. In a review of a proposed mining tax,
the Australian government exempted most commodities, raised the
threshold and cut the tax to 30 percent on coal and iron ore
earnings, compared with a previous plan to collect 40 percent of
all resource profits.  
 Xstrata, Dana  
 Xstrata Plc , the mining company that said last month the
proposed tax may prompt businesses in the industry to cancel
investments in Australia, added 3 percent to 871.1 pence for the
first gain in four days.  
 Dana surged 22 percent to 1,440 pence, leading gains in the
FTSE All-Share index. Korea National Oil Corp. said today it is
in preliminary discussions regarding a possible cash offer for
the Scottish explorer.  
 Rival  Tullow Oil Plc  rose 5.5 percent to 1,046 pence, while
Cairn Energy Plc increased 5.2 percent to 422.1 pence.  
 Aviva Plc climbed 3 percent to 315.1 pence. The insurer is
expecting to increase the amount of capital it generates to 1.3
billion pounds ($2 billion) this year, the Financial Times
reported, citing Chief Financial Officer  Patrick Regan .
