             Ampere AG, a Berlin-based firm that 
advises companies on how to manage their electricity costs, 
filed a suit against RWE AG, seeking to stop the German utility
from claiming back-payment of charges for alternative energy, 
Handelsblatt reported, citing Ampere.  
 The case aims to set a precedent after companies including 
RWE sought as much as 500 million euros ($624 million) in 
additional payments from their customers on the basis of a law 
introduced by a previous government that allows them to pass on
the total costs of renewable energy, the newspaper said.
