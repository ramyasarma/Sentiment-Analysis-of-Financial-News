             Siemens AG may be forced to write
down the value of its diagnostics division, which the company
built through acquisitions, Financial Times Deutschland
reported, citing recent remarks by Chief Financial Officer Joe
Kaeser.  
 Siemens Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher and his
predecessor, Klaus Kleinfeld, spent a total of 11 billion euros
($13.7 billion) on purchases to create the diagnostics division,
and the Munich-based company has struggled to meet growth
expectations at the unit, the newspaper said.  
 Kaeser may decide to write down the value of the division
when Siemens reports earnings after the end of its fiscal year
in September, the newspaper said. Siemens carries goodwill of
5.5 billion euros from the unit on its books, according to FTD.
