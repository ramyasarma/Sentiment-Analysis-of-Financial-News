             Connecticut Attorney General  Richard Blumenthal  said he is investigating “a massive security
breach” at  WellPoint Inc.  that may have compromised financial
and health information on almost 500,000 people.  
 Blumenthal wrote to the Indianapolis-based company, the
largest U.S. health insurer, asking for information on how the
breach occurred, what’s being done to protect those affected and
how to prevent future incidents, he said today in a statement.  
 “This information breach is only the latest in a
disturbing series of cases where nonpublic personal information
has been subjected to unauthorized access,” Blumenthal said in
his statement.  
 WellPoint should provide affected consumers with two years
of credit monitoring services and at least $25,000 of identity-
theft protection, Blumenthal said.  
 WellPoint notified 470,000 consumers last month about the
breach, which affected people who applied for individual
insurance, said Cindy Sanders, a spokeswoman.  
 Fewer than 940 of those notified had their actual
applications accessed, which could have revealed medical history
and credit card information, she said.  
 The problem was fixed in March, and WellPoint gave everyone
notified a year of free credit protection, she said.  
 The company is considering Blumenthal’s requests for
additional monitoring and identity-theft protection, Sanders
said. She couldn’t immediately confirm receipt of his letter.  
 October Upgrade  
 The breach resulted from an upgrade to WellPoint’s online
application tracker performed by an outside company last
October, Sanders said in a telephone interview. The insurer
learned of it in March when a California woman sued, saying she
could obtain confidential information by manipulating the Web
address.  
 “Within 12 hours of discovering the issue, we corrected
it,” Sanders said. The company tried to identify whose
information was affected, then decided to notify everyone whose
data could be affected, she said.  
 Attorneys for the woman who sued were among those who
gained access to the information, she said.  
 Blumenthal said he wanted the name of the computer company
that did the upgrade in October, how someone would be able to
manipulate the URL address to obtain the information, and how
WellPoint determined how many computers did so.  
 WellPoint fell 48 cents, or 1 percent, to $47.31 at 12:27
