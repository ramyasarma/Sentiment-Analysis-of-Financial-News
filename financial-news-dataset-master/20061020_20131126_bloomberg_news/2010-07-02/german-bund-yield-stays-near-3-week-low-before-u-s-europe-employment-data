             Portuguese and Irish government bonds
led euro-area debt securities higher amid waning concern that
nations on Europe’s periphery will struggle for funding.  
 The gains narrowed the extra yield investors demand to hold
the debt instead of benchmark German bunds, which slid after a
report today showed a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. jobs.
Sales by France and Spain yesterday completed auctions of almost
27 billion euros ($34 billion) of bonds this week, with Austria
and Germany due to sell debt next week.  
 “We successfully digested this big supply week, and next
week we have very limited supply,” said  Marcel Bross , an
interest-rate strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. That’s
“a major negative for peripherals removed,” he said.  
 The Portuguese 10-year bond yield fell 24 basis points to
5.41 percent, the lowest since June 14 based on closing prices.
The 4.8 percent security maturing in June 2020 rose 1.74, or
17.40 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 94.38. That narrowed
the difference in yield, or spread, with 10-year German bonds 26
basis points to 275 basis points.  
 The yield on the Irish 10-year bond fell 16 basis points to
5.38 percent, the Greek 10-year yield fell 13 basis points to
10.3 percent, and equivalent-maturity Italian bond yields fell
seven basis points to 4.03 percent.  
 The yield spread between Portuguese and German bonds was
set to narrow for the first week in three. Germany’s government
debt has returned 7 percent so far this year. Portugal’s has
handed investors a 5 percent loss, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts’
Societies, as the crisis that started in Greece threatened to
spread across Europe and infect financial institutions.  
 ECB Lending  
 The European Central Bank said two days ago it lent
institutions 131.9 billion euros for three months, compared with
the median forecast of 200 billion euros in a Bloomberg News
survey. The reduction in appetite for ECB funding damped concern
the region’s banks were struggling to raise funds, fueling
demand for assets perceived to be higher risk.  
 “Stress in the banking sector may not be as intense as
feared and we’re seeing a gradual pricing out of some of the
safe-haven premium on bunds,” Bross said.  
 The benchmark German 10-year bund yield rose two basis
points to 2.59 percent after U.S. Labor Department figures
showed payrolls declined by 125,000 last month as the government
cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010 census.
Economists projected a decline of 130,000 payrolls, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate
fell to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent as the labor force shrank.
