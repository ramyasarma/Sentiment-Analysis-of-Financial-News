             South Africa’s Springboks will play
New Zealand’s All Blacks in Soweto’s Soccer City stadium on
August 21 as part of the Tri-Nations rugby tournament,
stuff.co.nz reported, citing All Blacks coach  Graham Henry .  
 The move from Johannesburg’s Ellis Park, which has more
than 50,000 seats, to Soccer City, which has about 88,500 seats,
the Wellington-based website cited Henry as saying. Henry
confirmed the change in venue in response to a question about
it, according to the website.  
 The South African Rugby Union will announce the change in
venue on July 7, stuff.co.nz reported. The Pretoria-based Blue
Bulls won the semi-final and the final of the Super 14 rugby
tournament at Soweto’s Orlando Stadium after home ground Loftus
Versfeld was unavailable because of the soccer World Cup.
