             U.S. stocks dropped, extending the
longest slump for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the
financial crisis of 2008, on concern the economic rebound is
slowing after companies added fewer jobs than estimated and
factory orders slumped.  
 General Electric Co., Bank of America Corp., and DuPont Co.
lost at least 1.8 percent to lead the Dow to a seventh straight
decline. Equity Residential, the largest publicly traded U.S.
apartment landlord, slumped 2.5 percent after a downgrade from
Citigroup Inc. Ford Motor Co. retreated 3.3 percent, paring
gains from a rise yesterday.  
 The  S&P 500  slipped 0.7 percent to 1,020.58 at 2:56 p.m. in
New York, poised for its lowest close since September 2009. The
 Dow  decreased 64.74 points, or 0.7 percent, to 9,667.79.  
 “The word that jumps into my mind about the sentiment of
the market is ‘guarded,’” said  Hugh Johnson , who oversees $1.85
billion as chairman of Albany, New York-based Johnson Illington.
“Many of us believe the stock market is undervalued or cheap
based on a reasonable estimate for earnings. But the market is
sending a message, and the message is that our estimates for the
economy and earnings may be way too optimistic.”  
 The S&P 500 has fallen 5.2 percent this week as slowing
growth in manufacturing, an unexpected jump in jobless claims
and a slump in home sales fueled concern the economic recovery
was faltering. Today’s 83,000 increase in private payrolls
trailed the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey for
110,000. Factory orders fell 1.4 percent in May, a separate
report showed, almost three times as much as forecast.  
 Jobless Rate Falls  
 Total payrolls fell by 125,000 last month as the government
cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010 census, the
Labor Department said. Economists projected a drop of 130,000,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The
jobless rate fell to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent as the labor
force shrank.  
 Jan Hatzius , chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., said the “guts” of the jobs report signaled weakness,
including declines in the length of the average workweek and
lower hourly earnings.  
 “The report confirms that the labor market has not yet
reached the self-sustaining recovery stage, at a time when
forward-looking indicators of economic activity are
slackening,” Hatzius wrote in a note to clients.  
 September futures on the  S&P 500  swung in the seconds
before the data were released. The  contracts  traded as low as
1,023.70 at 8:29:44 a.m. New York time, or 16 seconds before the
jobs report came out, before jumping to 1,030 during the same
second, data compiled by Bloomberg. They settled back to
1,025.40 as of 8:29:45 a.m., the data show. Once the report was
released, the securities swung between 1,017.70 and 1,032.70,
compared with 1,021.80 at yesterday’s close.  
 Valuation Watch  
 The  S&P 500  tumbled 12 percent in the second quarter to the
cheapest valuation in more than a year on concern a sovereign-
debt crisis in Europe and China’s moves to slow the world’s
largest emerging economy will dent global growth. The equity
index slid 5.4 percent in June after losing 8.2 percent in May,
the biggest two-month loss since the start of 2009, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 The gauge closed yesterday at 12.6 times projected profits
for its companies, according to Bloomberg data, its cheapest
valuation since March 2009, when the gauge began an 80 percent
rally.  
 Price/Earnings Measures  
 The index traded at yesterday’s close with a PEG ratio, or
its price-earnings multiple using 2009 profit divided by
forecast annual income growth through 2012, of 0.78, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The indicator was a favored tool
of Fidelity Investments fund manager  Peter Lynch , who said
stocks trading with a PEG less of than 1 were undervalued.  
 Profits for companies in the S&P 500 are forecast to rise
32 percent to a combined $81.71 a share in 2010, according to
estimates from more than 2,000 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Forecasts for the U.S. economy to expand 3.2 percent this
year and 2.9 percent in 2011 incorporate estimates that the
jobless rate will be at 9.6 percent by the end of 2010 and 9.1
percent a year later.  
 “Earnings will be fine this quarter, I don’t think we’ll
see any significantly lowered guidance,” said  Barry Knapp ,
chief U.S. equity strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. “Earnings
at the back half of the year look too high, though they’re not
wildly optimistic. 2011 looks wildly optimistic particularly
given the path for GDP. There will be a point in time later in
the year where the market will deal with significantly lowered
earnings expectations, though not this quarter.”  
 Ford, Equity Residential  
 Ford dropped 3.3 percent to $10.22, leading the S&P 500
Automobiles & Components Index down 2.2 percent for the biggest
loss of 24 groups in the S&P 500. Ford and  General Motors Co. 
yesterday reported June sales that fell short of analyst
estimates as consumers concerned about unemployment and the
economy avoided large purchases. Ford shares rose 4.9 percent
yesterday.  
 Equity Residential  slumped 2.6 percent to $40.57, helping
lead real-estate companies in the S&P 500 down 2.4 percent. The
shares were cut to “sell” from “hold” at Citigroup, which
said residential and self-storage real-estate stocks are
expensive compared with growth prospects.  
 Airlines slumped, with  Continental Airlines Inc.  retreating
9.8 percent to $19.99. The Houston based-airline had its second-
quarter earnings-per-share estimate reduced by Solebury Research
LLC analyst  James Higgins  after the company yesterday said June
revenue from each seat flown a mile increased 22 percent,
falling short of Higgins’s 27 percent estimate.  
 Airlines Slump  
 Delta Air Lines Inc.  fell 7.6 percent to $10.83 and  US
Airways Group Inc.  lost 5.9 percent to $8.14. The carriers won’t
pursue a swap of slots in New York and Washington, the companies
said today in a U.S. Transportation Department filing, and will
challenge in federal court a U.S. requirement that they give
rivals more access to flights at LaGuardia Airport in New York
and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.  
 Morgan Stanley  fell 1.3 percent to $22.79. The owner of the
world’s largest brokerage sold its Russian mortgage unit City
Mortgage Bank to Orient Express Bank, the U.S. lender said in a
statement today.  
 Frontier Communications Corp.  fell 6.8 percent to $7.17 for
the biggest drop in the S&P 500. The phone company serving rural
U.S. markets said it completed the acquisition of  Verizon
Communications Inc. ’s local wireline business in 14 states.
Verizon, which said its shareholders are receiving Frontier
stock after its spinoff, had the biggest gain in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, climbing 2.1 percent to $26.84.  
 Blockbuster Tumbles  
 Blockbuster Inc.  tumbled 21 percent to 18 cents, after
sinking to 15 cents earlier, the lowest intraday price since
March 2009. The money-losing video-rental chain said the New
York Stock Exchange informed the company it will begin the
process of delisting its common stock. Shareholders rejected a
proposal for a reverse split of the shares needed to boost the
price and comply with the exchange’s listing requirements.  
 Sanofi-Aventis SA, France’s biggest drugmaker, is preparing
a major acquisition in the U.S., people with knowledge of the
situation said. Health-care companies Allergan Inc., Biogen Idec
Inc. and Genzyme Corp. gained on speculation they may be the
object of Sanofi’s interest.  
 Allergan Inc. , which sells the Botox wrinkle smoother,
jumped the most in S&P 500, climbing 6.5 percent to $61.87.
Biogen Idec Inc., the world’s largest maker of multiple-
sclerosis treatments, advanced 5.3 percent to $49.20. Genzyme
Corp., the world’s largest maker of drugs for rare genetic
diseases, added 5.8 percent to $52.76.  
 Consumer Stocks  
 Consumer discretionary stocks  in the S&P 500 slid 1.4
percent as a group. International Game Technology dropped 3.5
percent to $15.41. The maker of computerized casino gaming
systems had its 2011 earnings and share-price estimate cut at
Morgan Joseph & Co., which said the company’s 2011 profit will
be below expectations.  
 “Many of the numbers, in particular for consumer
discretionary stocks, look too high,” said  Russ Koesterich , the
San Francisco-based head of investment strategy for scientific
active equities at BlackRock Inc., which manages $3.36 trillion
in assets for the world’s largest asset manager. “The earnings
numbers for 2010 are aggressive unless you believe there’s a V-
shaped recovery. Clearly we’re not in a V-shaped recovery.”
