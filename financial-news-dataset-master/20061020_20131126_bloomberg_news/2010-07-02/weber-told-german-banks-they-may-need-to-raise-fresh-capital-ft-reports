             Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  told
German banks at a meeting on June 30 that they should prepare
emergency capital-raising plans in case they fail stress tests,
the Financial Times reported, citing an unidentified executive
present at the meeting.  
 Weber told the chief executive officers of 16 German banks
they may need to recapitalize either with the help of their
owners or the German bank rescue fund, the FT quoted the
executive as saying. This could lead to the forced
recapitalizations of some banks, the banker said, according to
the FT.  
 The FT also reported that bankers and analysts expect up to
20 of Europe’s banks to be forced into cash calls as a result of
this month’s stress tests, raising up to 30 billion euros ($37.4
billion) of fresh equity.
