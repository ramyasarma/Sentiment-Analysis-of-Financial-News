             Peruvian bonds posted a weekly rise,
pushing yields to their lowest level in five weeks, as economic
growth lifts demand from foreign investors.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, this week to 5.8 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s
local unit. That’s the lowest since May 26. The bond’s price
rose 0.40 centimo this week to 116.09 centimos per sol. The
yield was unchanged today at 2:58 p.m. New York time.  
 Consumer prices may rise 2.5 percent to 3 percent this year
as the economy grows as much as 6 percent on rising investment
in the mining, natural gas and electricity industries, Finance
Minister  Mercedes Araoz  said at a conference in Lima yesterday.
Inflation accelerated to 1.64 percent in June, the fastest pace
since August 2009, the government said yesterday.  
 “Peru is attracting foreign investment as all its economic
indicators are in positive territory,” said  Frank Babarczy ,
head of trading at Banco Continental. “There’s demand from
abroad across the curve in anticipation of lower yields and a
strengthening sol.”  
 Corporacion Financiera de Desarollo S.A., Peru’s state
development bank, is “almost ready” to commence a $200 million
sol bond issue in the local market, its first since January
2009, the bank’s Chief Financial Officer  Carlos Linares  said in
an interview yesterday. The lender also plans to issue up to
$250 million of global bonds this year as it boosts financing
for local infrastructure projects.  
 Peru’s sol was little changed at 2.8245 per dollar from
2.8255 yesterday. The  central bank  purchased $25 million in the
foreign-exchange market today, its third intervention this week.
