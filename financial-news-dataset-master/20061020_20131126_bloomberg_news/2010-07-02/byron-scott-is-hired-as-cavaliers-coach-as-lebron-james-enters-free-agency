             Byron Scott  was hired as coach of the
Cleveland Cavaliers on the same day that  LeBron James  became a
free agent.  
 Scott, 49, led the New Jersey Nets to consecutive
appearances in the NBA Finals in 2002-03 and was voted the
National Basketball Association’s Coach of the Year in 2008 with
the New Orleans Hornets. Contract details weren’t disclosed.  
 “I’m anxious to get going and to build on the success the
Cavaliers have experienced in recent years,” Scott said in a
statement on Cleveland’s website last night. “This is a great
job and an impressive organization and I’m very happy to be a
part of it.”  
 Scott succeeds  Mike Brown , who was fired in May after the
team’s second-round playoff loss. The hiring could make Scott
the next coach for James, who won the NBA’s Most Valuable Player
award the past two seasons while leading the Cavaliers to a 127-
37 record.  
 James is the NBA’s most coveted free agent this offseason
and from yesterday began to have meetings with teams such as the
New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls and
Los Angeles Clippers.  
 Scott coached the Nets in 2001-04 and the New Orleans
Hornets in 2004-10, compiling a  352-355  record. He was named
Coach of the Year after leading the Hornets to a 56-26 record in
the 2007-8 season.  
 Scott won three NBA titles as a player over 14 seasons,
including 11 with the Los Angeles Lakers.  
 “Byron’s combination of high-level success and depth of
experience, both as a head coach and as a player, is a
tremendous asset,” Cleveland’s General Manager Chris Gant said.
“He’s a strong leader with a proven track record of winning in
both the regular season and the playoffs.”
