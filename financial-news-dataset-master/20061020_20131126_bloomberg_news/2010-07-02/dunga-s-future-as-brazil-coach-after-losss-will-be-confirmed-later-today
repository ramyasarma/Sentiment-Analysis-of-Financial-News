             Dunga’s future as Brazil coach will
be clarified after he speaks with national soccer federation
officials. Brazil was eliminated 2-1 by the Netherlands in the
World Cup quarterfinals today.  
 “He needs to speak to the CBF and then we will know,”
federation spokesman Rodrigo Paiva said in an interview in Port
Elizabeth, South Africa. CBF is the Portuguese acronym for the
Brazilian soccer federation.  
 Dunga, who captained Brazil’s 1994 World Cup-champion team, 
said his contract as coach has come to an end. “I was contracted 
for four years and we knew this right from the start,” Dunga told
reporters.
