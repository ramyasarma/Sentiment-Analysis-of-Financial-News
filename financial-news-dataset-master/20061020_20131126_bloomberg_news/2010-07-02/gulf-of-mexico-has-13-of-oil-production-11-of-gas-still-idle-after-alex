             About 13 percent of crude-oil
production in the Gulf of Mexico and 11 percent of natural-gas
output remain idled in the wake of Alex, the earliest hurricane
of the Atlantic storm season since 1995, the U.S. government
said today.  
 Oil and gas producers report four rigs and 50 production
platforms are still empty of workers who were evacuated ahead of
the storm, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement said in a  statement  on its website. About 205,000
barrels of daily oil production remain shut-in, along with 694
million cubic feet of gas.  
 Yesterday, about 21 percent of oil and 14 percent of gas
production in the Gulf was reported shut-in. Alex, which peaked
June 30 as a Category 2 hurricane with winds reaching 100 mph,
was downgraded to a tropical depression yesterday and dissipated
over the mountains of central Mexico.  
 The Gulf produced 1.6 million barrels of oil and an
estimated 6.4 billion cubic feet of gas a day in March,
according to the bureau, which is part of the U.S. Interior
Department. The report on shut-in production is based on
responses from 30 companies as of 12:30 p.m. New York time.  
 The Gulf is home to about 31 percent of U.S. oil output and
about 10 percent of gas production, according to the Energy
Department.
