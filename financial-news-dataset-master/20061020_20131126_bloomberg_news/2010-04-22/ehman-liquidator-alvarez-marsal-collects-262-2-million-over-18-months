             Bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. accused Nomura Holdings Inc. of “egregious inflation” for
seeking $2 billion to resolve claims in a series of derivatives
deals and said the Japanese brokerage actually owes it money.  
 Lehman is fighting Nomura in two lawsuits and in a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court dispute that it wants to consolidate in a
single case. It says the Nomura claims stemming from guaranteed
swap agreements are overstated by hundreds of millions of
dollars, according to a court filing today in the Manhattan
bankruptcy court.  
 “Those claims are premised on purported valuations and
calculations that are commercially unreasonable, divorced from
economic reality, and bear no relation to any actual damages or
losses suffered by the Nomura entities,” Lehman said.  
 Lehman is trying to trim claims for payment, which
originally totaled as much as $1 trillion, as it seeks court
permission to reorganize.  
 The defunct investment bank said it seeks “redress against
the Nomura Entities for their egregious inflation by, in some
cases, hundreds of millions of dollars of the proofs of claim
that the Nomura Entities filed under penalty of perjury.”
Lehman said Nomura, based in Tokyo, filed duplicate claims
against Lehman and an affiliate in bankruptcy court.  
 Peter Truell, a New York spokesman for Nomura, declined to
comment.  
 Lehman said it wants to reduce the Nomura claims to zero,
and asserted in court filings that two units of Nomura owe it an
undisclosed amount.  
 Disputes With Creditors  
 Lehman, which has been trying to resolve disputes with
creditors through mediation, said the lawsuits against Nomura
were a last resort.  
 “We prefer to settle contracts at fair value via
consensual agreement with cooperating counterparties, but will
not hesitate to use the legal system when we deem it necessary
based on the actions of our counterparties,” said Locke
McMurray, head bankruptcy lawyer for derivatives at Lehman. The
lawsuits show for the first time how Lehman values derivatives
contracts, he said.  
 The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
