             Lihir Gold Ltd., the second-largest
gold mining producer on the Australian stock exchange, said
first-quarter bullion output declined 26 percent, in line with
company guidance.  
 Production was 229,757 ounces in the three months ended
March 31, from 312,331 ounces a year earlier, the Port Moresby,
Papua New Guinea-based company said today in a statement. That
compares with UBS AG’s forecast of 249,000 ounces.  
 Lihir, which has rejected a A$9.4 billion ($8.6 billion)
takeover offer from larger rival Newcrest Mining Ltd., in
January cut its full-year output target by as much as 15 percent.
The company today raised it to between 1 million ounces and 1.1
million ounces, from 960,000 ounces to 1.06 million ounces.  
 “We are open to considering any opportunities that will
deliver increased returns to shareholders,” Chief Executive
Officer Graeme Hunt said in the statement. Guidance for total
cash costs was maintained at below $450 an ounce, he said.  
 Lihir shares rose 0.8 percent to close at A$3.95 on the
Australian stock exchange. They have risen 20 percent this year.  
 The company has mines in Papua New Guinea, West Africa and
Australia. Newcrest on March 29 offered one of its shares for
every nine of Lihir’s, plus 22.5 cents cash, less any dividend
declared this half.  
 Lihir has appointed Macquarie Capital Advisers and
Greenhill Caliburn to help study alternatives to the Newcrest
offer.
