             Canadian stocks rose for a fifth
day after commodity producers rallied on the U.S. dollar’s slide
and sales of new homes and orders for durable goods excluding
vehicles rose in the U.S., the country’s biggest trade partner.  
 Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s second-biggest gold producer,
gained 1.3 percent as the metal climbed the most in two weeks.
Suncor Energy Inc., the country’s largest oil and gas company,
increased 2 percent as the U.S. government reported the biggest
increase in home sales since April 1963. Sears Canada Inc.,
which owns Sears department stores in Canada, fell 1.8 percent
after Sears Holdings Corp. agreed to raise its stake to 90.4
percent.  
 The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 78.77
points, or 0.7 percent, to an 18-month high of 12,239.64. The
index last climbed five times in a week in July.  
 “That housing sales number today was shocking,” said
Barry Schwartz, a portfolio manager at Baskin Financial Services
Inc. in Toronto, which manages about C$340 million ($339
million). “If the consumer is getting better, the housing
market is healing, that means the U.S. will grow and take us
along for the ride.”  
 The S&P/TSX rallied 1.4 percent this week as companies
including EnCana Corp., American Express Co., Boeing Co. and
Apple Inc. have reported profit above the average analyst
estimate. In the earnings season that began last week, 85
percent of S&P 500 companies and five of eight S&P/TSX companies
have beaten analyst forecasts.  
 Gold Stocks Gain  
 Gold stocks gained as the U.S. dollar fell for the first
time in seven days against a basket of world currencies. Greece
asked for help from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund to address its budget deficit, the widest among
countries that use the euro currency.  
 Goldcorp advanced 1.3 percent to C$40.38. Barrick Gold
Corp., its larger rival, increased 0.6 percent to C$40.41.
European Goldfields Ltd., which mines in Greece, led the S&P/TSX
with a 7.4 percent jump to C$7.51.  
 New Gold Inc., which produces in Australia, Mexico and the
U.S., rallied for a second day after announcing a 44 percent
sales increase, gaining 6.2 percent to C$5.70. In a note dated
yesterday, Bank of Montreal analyst Andrew Kaip raised his price
estimate on the company to C$6.75 from C$5.80.  
 The U.S. Commerce Department said orders for durable goods
except vehicles jumped 2.8 percent in March, four times as much
as the median forecast of 44 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Home sales climbed 27 percent, more than any of 77 surveyed
economists estimated.  
 Suncor  
 Suncor rose 2 percent to C$34.53 as oil rallied 1.7 percent
to $85.12 a barrel. Imperial Oil Ltd., Canada’s second-largest
energy company, gained 1.9 percent to a five-month high of
C$43.03. Enbridge Inc., the country’s biggest pipeline company,
advanced 1.8 percent to C$50.55.  
 Sears Canada, the second-largest Canadian retailer of
general merchandise, fell 1.8 percent to C$29 after U.S. sister
company Sears Holdings Corp. agreed to buy Pershing Square
Capital Management LP’s 17 percent stake for C$30 a share. Sears
Holdings can now acquire the rest of the Canadian unit without a
vote of shareholders.  
 Cline Mining Corp., which is developing coal, gold and iron
projects, soared 24 percent to C$2.52 after receiving U.S.
government approval to rehabilitate a coal mine on Colorado.
Cline Mining shares have jumped more than fourfold since the
beginning of March.  
 CGI Group Inc., Canada’s largest computer-services
provider, dropped 1.6 percent to C$15.26. Analyst Steven Li of
Raymond James Financial Inc. cut his rating on the stock to
“market perform” from “outperform,” citing CGI’s rally to
within 3.1 percent of his price estimate as of yesterday.
