             Renovalia Energy SA, the Spanish
renewable-power producer, sees no chance of the government
reducing rates earned by existing clean-energy plants, co-owner
Juan Domingo Ortega said today.  
 “No sensible government is going to do this,” Ortega said
in Madrid at a briefing where company executives commented on
their planned initial public offering to raise as much as 153
million euros ($203 million).  
 Spain is considering such reductions, an industry ministry
spokesman said yesterday. While the government has negotiated a
lowering of prices with the wind and solar industries for
months, the main target for reductions was yet-to-be-built
plants, not existing generators, according to comments from
participants in recent months.  
 More than half of the company’s 120 million euros in 2009
sales came from solar farms governed by the 2008 pricing regime,
Chief Executive Officer Jaime Galobart told reporters. The price
for power from those plants may be cut by as much as 40 percent
this year, El Economista reported yesterday.  
 Ortega said the possibility of a rate reduction for
existing plants hadn’t entered into the company’s financial
forecasts because it was so unlikely.  
 Trade groups representing wind and solar energy producers
yesterday called on the government to clarify its position
because the uncertainty is undermining stock prices. The
Renewables Forum said the threat of price cuts for existing
plants increases the “country risk” associated with Spain.
