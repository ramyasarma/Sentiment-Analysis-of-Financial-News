             Caltex Australia Ltd., the
country’s biggest oil refiner, said it has a “cautious”
outlook for the margins it expects to earn in the second half of
the year from turning crude into fuels.  
 Caltex also said it aims to make an announcement
“shortly” on how it will respond to the competition
regulator’s December decision to block the proposed A$300
million ($278 million) purchase of Exxon Mobil Corp. filling
stations, according to a stock-exchange filing from the Sydney-
based company today. The Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission said the transaction may push prices higher.  
 Weaker energy demand sparked by the worst global economic
downturn since the Great Depression and growth in capacity have
put pressure on refining margins, Caltex said earlier this year.  
 Caltex, up 32 percent this year in Sydney trading, dropped
0.5 percent to A$12.21 at 10:12 a.m. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index, which has gained 0.9 percent this year, was 0.8 percent
lower.  
 The refiner, half-owned by Chevron Corp., reported first-
quarter profit, after tax, of A$130 million, according to the
document filed today. Volumes of jet fuel, lubricants and
premium petrol increased in the quarter from a year earlier, the
company said.  
 Since joining Caltex last July, Chief Executive Officer
Julian Segal has said the refiner may diversify into areas such
as biofuels and liquefied natural gas.
