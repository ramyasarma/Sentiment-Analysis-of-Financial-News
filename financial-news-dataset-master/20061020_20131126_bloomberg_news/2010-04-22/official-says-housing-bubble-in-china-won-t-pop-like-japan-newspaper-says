             China’s property market bubble
won’t burst like Japan’s did in the early 1990s, Shanghai
Securities News reported, citing Zheng Xinli, deputy director
general of government think tank China Center for International
Economic Exchanges.   
 The bubble is still at an early stage of formation, the
newspaper quoted Zheng as saying.   
 Current government measures will curb abnormal demand and
growth in real estate markets, Zheng said, according to the
report.
