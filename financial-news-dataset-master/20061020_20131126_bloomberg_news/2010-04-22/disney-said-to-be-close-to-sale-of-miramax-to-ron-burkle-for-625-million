             Walt Disney Co. is close to an
agreement to sell its Miramax film studio to billionaire Ron
Burkle’s Yucaipa Cos. for $625 million, two people with
knowledge of the negotiations said.  
 An agreement may be completed in 48 hours, according to
three people who asked not to be identified because the
discussions aren’t public.  
 Disney entered exclusive negotiations on April 16 with
Burkle, who is working with Miramax founders Bob and Harvey
Weinstein. Burkle raised his offer to $625 million last week,
one of the people said. He plans to contribute $325 million in
cash and borrow the rest, they said.  
 Disney, the world’s biggest media company, gained 2 cents
to $36.56 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have gained 13 percent this year.  
 Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, declined to comment.  
 Weinstein Co., the New York-based film company run by the
Weinstein brothers, will be the global distributor of Miramax
movies theatrically, for home video and on television, two of
the people said.  
 The brothers, who won’t hold an equity stake, will receive
pay and performance bonuses for overseeing the studio and
library, the two people said. The industry newsletter
TheWrap.com reported the outline of the deal earlier today.
