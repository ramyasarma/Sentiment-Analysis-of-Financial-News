             Adidas AG, the world’s second-
largest sporting-goods maker, rose as much as 4.7 percent in
Frankfurt trading after raising its annual earnings forecast and
saying profit increased for the first time in five quarters.  
 The shares gained as much as 1.99 euros to 44.81 and traded
at 44.29 euros as of 9:27 a.m. local time, the biggest advance
in Germany’s benchmark DAX Index. A close at the most recent
price would be the highest since June, 2008.  
 Adidas now forecasts full-year earnings per share of 2.05
euros to 2.30 euros. The company had previously expected profit
on that basis of 1.90 euros to 2.15 euros. First-quarter net
income rose to 168 million euros ($223 million), or 80 cents a
share, from 5 million euros, or 4 cents, a year earlier, the
Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company also said late yesterday.  
 “The figures look good at a first glance,” said Thomas
Rosenke, an analyst at WestLB AG in Frankfurt.  
 Adidas will outfit 12 teams at this summer’s soccer World
Cup, more than any other sporting-goods maker. Chief Executive
Officer Herbert Hainer said this week he’s seeing “extremely
good acceptance” of products, including balls and jerseys,
connected with the tournament.  
 Profit in the quarter was also boosted by the settlement of
a lawsuit and the sale of a trademark, both of which contributed
a “low-double-digit” million euro amount to the earnings.  
 Sales rose 4 percent to almost 2.7 billion euros, the
company said, citing preliminary figures.  
 Adidas will report final figures for the quarter on May 4.
