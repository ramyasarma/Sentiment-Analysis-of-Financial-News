             Crude oil traded below $84 a barrel
in New York as the dollar rallied to its strongest in almost a
year against the euro, damping investor demand for commodities.  
 Oil is set for a weekly gain amid speculation that fuel
demand will grow with an economic recovery in the U.S., the
world’s biggest energy consumer. Sales of previously owned homes
in the country climbed in March for the first month in four and
new applications for jobless benefits declined. OPEC will reduce
crude oil shipments for the first time since March as refiners
in Asia cut imports.  
 “Oil is taking a bit of a breather, the U.S. dollar
strengthened and that has knocked it over a bit,” said Peter
McGuire, managing director at CWA Global Markets Pty in Sydney.
“Over the next two to three months there is more upside.”  
 Crude oil for June delivery was at $83.49 a barrel, down 21
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 3:37 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract rose 2
cents to settle at $83.70. Futures, which lost 2 percent last
week, are little changed for the week.  
 The dollar strengthened against the 16-nation euro after
the European Union said Greece’s budget deficit last year was
worse than forecast. The U.S. currency reached $1.3202 per euro,
the highest since April 30, 2009. Finance ministers from the
Group of 20 industrial and developing nations are scheduled to
meet today in Washington.  
 U.S. initial jobless applications dropped by 24,000 to
456,000 in the week ended April 16, the first decline in three
weeks, Labor Department data showed yesterday. The National
Association of Realtors said existing-home sales advanced 6.8
percent to a 5.35 million annual rate, exceeding the media
forecast from economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 OPEC Shipments  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut
crude shipments as Asian refiners shut plants for maintenance,
tanker tracker Oil Movements said yesterday.  
 OPEC, a 12-member group that pumps 40 percent of the
world’s crude, will ship 23.25 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to May 8, according to the Halifax, England-based
consultant. That’s the first reported decline since the month
ended March 20. The data excludes Ecuador and Angola.  
 OPEC slashed production by a record 4.2 million barrels a
day beginning January 2009 to prevent a supply glut as the
global economy sank into recession. Group members left official
output quotas unchanged when ministers met March 17 in Vienna.  
 Price Survey  
 Oil may fall next week as U.S. inventories gain and fuel
consumption declines, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Twenty-two of 49 analysts and traders, or 45 percent,
forecast prices will decline through April 30. Seventeen
respondents, or 35 percent, predicted futures will increase and
10 said the market will be little changed. Last week, 44 percent
of analysts said prices would rise.  
 Brent crude oil for June settlement was at $85.45 a barrel,
down 22 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
at 3:38 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract declined 3
cents to end the session at $85.67.  
 Brent is trading at a premium of $1.96 a barrel to New York
oil futures, compared with a discount of $1.21 a month earlier.
