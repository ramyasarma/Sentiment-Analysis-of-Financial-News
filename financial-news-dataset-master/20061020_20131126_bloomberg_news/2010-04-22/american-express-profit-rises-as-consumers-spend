             American Express Co. , the biggest
U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases, hired  Daniel Schulman  from
 Sprint Nextel Corp.  to head a new enterprise growth group and
named  Ted Leonsis , who was chairman of Revolution Money before
its acquisition by AmEx, to the company’s board.  
 Schulman, 52, will be a member of the firm’s operating
committee, reporting to Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth I. Chenault . Leonsis, 53, the billionaire owner of the Washington
Capitals hockey team and former vice chairman of American Online
Inc., will be chairman of a new innovation and technology
committee, New York-based AmEx said today in a statement.  
 Schulman joined Sprint last year after the carrier’s
acquisition of Virgin Mobile USA, where he had been CEO.
Sprint’s prepaid business has become its  fastest-growing , with
brands including Virgin, Boost Mobile, Common Cents Mobile and
Assurance Wireless. The prepaid group added 348,000 customers
last quarter while the company lost subscribers overall.  
 “We looked outside the industry for a proven leader who
knows how to transform today’s technology into tomorrow’s
products,” Chenault, 59, said in the statement. “We wanted
someone whose expertise cut across online and mobile technology,
who has built new businesses, who knows how to work with great
brands and who could help us leverage our existing assets and
build new ones.”  
 Schulman, who also served as CEO of  Priceline.com Inc. , is
a director of  Symantec Corp.  and  Flextronics International Ltd. ,
and a member of the board of Rutgers University and Autism
Speaks. He will be replaced at Sprint by  Robert H. Johnson , 56,
who had been in charge of the company’s consumer business.  
 Revolution Money Acquired  
 Leonsis was named a special adviser to AmEx in November
when the card issuer announced it would pay about $300 million
to buy Revolution Money. The Internet-based payments network had
billed itself to merchants as a low-cost alternative to AmEx,
 Visa Inc.  and  MasterCard Inc.   
 American Express, which plans to report second-quarter
results tomorrow after the market close, climbed 45 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $42.51 at 9:34 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kansas,
declined 8 cents to $4.63.
