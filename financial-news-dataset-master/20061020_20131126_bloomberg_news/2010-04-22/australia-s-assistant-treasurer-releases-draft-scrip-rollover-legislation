             Australia released draft
legislation that would ease capital gains tax liability for
shareholders of companies involved in mergers and takeovers.  
 People and trusts exchanging shares to one company from
another during a merger or takeover currently have to pay any
capital gains at the time of the transaction. The revised laws
would defer that tax liability until if and when those shares
are sold, Assistant Treasurer Nick Sherry said.  
 “The legislation is good news for certain shareholders
facing an unforeseen tax event,” Sherry said in an e-mailed
statement. “Increasing the scope for scrip for scrip rollover
in this way means there’s one less obstacle to takeovers and
mergers.”  
 Consultation on the draft legislation closes on May 7,
Sherry said.
