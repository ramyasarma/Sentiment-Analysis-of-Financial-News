             The New Zealand Rugby Union said it
posted a record loss of NZ$15.9 million ($11.3 million) in 2009.  
 The loss, which follows a profit of NZ$366,000 in 2008, was
“attributed in part to the impact of the global recession on
income” and “investments in hosting Rugby World Cup 2011,”
the Wellington-based organization said today.    
 “Of the loss, NZ$9.5 million is on our operating budget,
mainly from a shortfall in income on All Blacks Test matches at
home and abroad, reduced interest income and increased
expenditure on medical support,” Steve Tew, the NZRU’s chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
