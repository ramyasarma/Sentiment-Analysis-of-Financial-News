             Michel Barnier, the EU’s financial-
services commissioner, told French daily La Tribune in an
interview that he wants agreement on a new system of financial
regulation by the end of 2011.  
 Barnier told the newspaper that he wants a reduction in
speculation in primary raw materials, especially agricultural
products, which he called “scandalous.” He added that he
supports the idea of a tax on financial transactions to help
tackle problems including those faced by emerging economies.
