after France’s second-largest carmaker yesterday posted a 7.6
gain in third-quarter sales because of growth in emerging
markets including Russia, Brazil and Argentina.  The numbers were “strong, but guidance disappoints,”
Credit Suisse Group AG analyst  Arndt Ellinghorst  wrote in a

profitability of the business.” He maintained his
“outperform” recommendation on the shares.  The stock was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at
Societe Generale.  STMicroelectronics NV  (STM FP) surged 3.1 percent to 6.33
