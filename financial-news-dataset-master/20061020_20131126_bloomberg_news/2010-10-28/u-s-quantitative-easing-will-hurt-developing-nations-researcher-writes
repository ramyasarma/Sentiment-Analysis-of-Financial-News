Quantitative easing in the U.S. will
“seriously damage” the interests of developing nations,
spuring inflation and pushing up asset prices in emerging
economies, Lu Haiqi, a researcher with China’s National Bureau
of Statistics, wrote in an article published in today’s Shanghai
Securities News.  The easing is also likely to trigger currency and trade
disputes and limit the space for developing nations to set their
own monetary policies, Lu wrote. The weakness and excessive
issuance of the dollar as a result of quantitative easing will
drive up the price of global commodities such as oil and grains,
exerting inflationary pressure on developing nations, Lu wrote.  The easing will also lead to higher living costs for U.S.
residents as the price of imported goods increases, Lu wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
