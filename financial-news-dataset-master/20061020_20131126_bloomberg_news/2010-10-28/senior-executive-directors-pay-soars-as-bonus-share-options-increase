Senior U.K. executive directors pay
soared as bonuses and share options swelled, according to an
annual remuneration report from  Incomes Data Services .  Total salaries of FTSE 100 directors climbed an average 55
percent in the year to June 30, while at FTSE 350 companies
there was an increase of about 45 percent, the London-based pay
research group said in an e-mailed statement. FTSE 100 chief
executive officers were paid on average 4.9 million pounds ($7.8
million) during the period.  “Incentive payments may have declined sharply in the face
of a deep recession last year, but it appears that it only needs
the mildest of economic recoveries for the payments to bounce
back to the same levels they were at during the boom years,”
Steve Tatton, editor of the IDS Directors Pay Report, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
