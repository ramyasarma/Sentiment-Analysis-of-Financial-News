Bank of Communications Ltd. , China’s
fifth-largest bank, posted a 24 percent gain in third-quarter
profit as an economic recovery boosted income from  loans  and
lending margin.  Net income climbed to 9.18 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), or
0.17 yuan a share, from a restated 7.39 billion yuan, or 0.14
yuan, a year earlier, the Shanghai-based company, also known as
BoCom, said in a statement today. That fell short of the 9.5
billion yuan median  estimate  of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Outstanding loans at BoCom, part-owned by  HSBC Holdings
Plc , rose 18 percent from the beginning of the year to 2.2
trillion yuan at the end of September, according to today’s
statement. The bank’s impaired loan ratio was unchanged at 1.22
percent as of Sept. 30 from three months earlier.  Shares  of BoCom have gained 7.5 percent in Hong Kong this
year, compared with a 6 increase in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index . The stock closed 1.8 percent higher at HK$9.19 today,
before the earnings were announced.  BoCom’s capital adequacy ratio, a key measure of financial
strength, stood at 12.53 percent as of Sept. 30.  Net interest income, or the revenue from lending minus
interest paid to depositors, gained 24 percent to 21.6 billion
yuan in the third quarter, after net interest margin expanded.
Fees and commissions from credit cards and distribution of
mutual funds and insurance policies gained 15.8 percent to 3.54
billion yuan.  The bank set aside 4.6 billion yuan of provisions against
soured debt in the past three months, compared with 2.5 billion
yuan a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
