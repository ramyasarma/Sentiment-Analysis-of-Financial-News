Lead may rise to about $2,700 a
metric ton after breaking a long-term downtrend, implying a gain
of about 6.3 percent, according to technical analysis by
independent analyst  Jim Stellakis .  The attached chart shows lead’s rising trend channel since
June and that prices earlier this month climbed above a 2008-
2010 downtrend line. That’s developed a “longer-term pattern”
and may help push prices to $2,700, near this year’s high of
$2,690 a ton in January, Stellakis said.  “Lead has one of the best long-term patterns among the
base metals,” said Stellakis, founder of New York-based
research company Technical Alpha. “The steep rally over the
past few weeks has made it vulnerable to pullbacks, but a rise
to $2,700 over the coming months would not be unlikely.”  Lead , mostly used in batteries, gained 12 percent this
month, outperforming every main industrial metal on the London
Metal Exchange except zinc. Lead for three-month delivery traded
at $2,540 a ton at 7:15 a.m. local time, taking this year’s gain
to 4.4 percent. It’s also the worst-performing main LME metal
this year after zinc.  Prices may be supported by the rising uptrend line from
June at about $2,350 and the 2008-2010 downtrend line at about
$2,300, Stellakis said. A climb above the $2,700 level may help
push the metal toward $3,000, he said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
