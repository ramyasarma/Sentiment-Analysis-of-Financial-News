The number of unemployed people in
Germany fell by 3,000 to 3.15 million in seasonally-adjusted
terms in October, the Federal Labor Agency said today in an e-
mailed statement.   Joblessness declined by 4,000 in western Germany while it
rose by 1,000 in the eastern half of the country, the Nuremberg-
based agency said.   “The labor market is benefitting from good economic
growth,” Labor Agency head Frank-Juergen Weise said in the
statement. “Demand for labor is high.”   The number of people on shortened shifts fell to 173,000 in
August, down 97,000 from the previous month, the agency said.  The Labor Ministry released the unadjusted figures in
Berlin yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
