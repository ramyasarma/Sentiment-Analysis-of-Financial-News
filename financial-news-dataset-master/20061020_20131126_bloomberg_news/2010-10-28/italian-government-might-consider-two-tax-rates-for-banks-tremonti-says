Italian Finance Minister Giulio
Tremonti said it may be a good idea to tax banks differently for
commercial lending activity and financial investments.  Italy “could consider” coming up with two tax rates for
banks to try to discourage “speculation,” he said today during
a speech in Rome. A lower rate could be used on commericial and
industrial lending, while a higher rate would be applied to
financial instruments and investments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
