German Finance Ministry officials
have drafted a European Union mechanism for state insolvencies
that involves an extension of sovereign-debt maturities, a
suspension of interest payments and a waiver on creditors’
claims, Handelsblatt reported, citing an unidentified government
official.   The draft, which will be presented in coming weeks, avoids
the term “orderly insolvency,” the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
