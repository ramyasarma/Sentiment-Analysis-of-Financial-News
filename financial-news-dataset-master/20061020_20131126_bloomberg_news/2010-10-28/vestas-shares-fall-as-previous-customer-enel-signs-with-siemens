Vestas Wind Systems A/S , the world’s
largest maker of wind turbines, fell for a fifth day in
Copenhagen trading after a customer chose rival  Siemens AG  to
deliver machines for new European projects.  Vestas fell as much as 4.1 percent after Munich-based
Siemens said it signed a contract with  Enel Green Power  for
turbine capacity of as 1,200 megawatts. Vestas last month signed
a contract with Enel for 400 megawatts capacity with an option
for an additional 1,000 megawatts.  “It would have been very good for Vestas to get this
order, but Enel appears to want to diversify its supplier
network like some other big wind park developers have done,”
 Jacob Pedersen , analyst with Aaabenraa, Denmark-based  Sydbank
A/S  said by phone.  Randers, Denmark-based Vestas is heading for its worst
 annual performance  since 2002, after twice lowering its sales
forecast for 2010. The company, which has lost more than half
its market value in a year, two days ago said orders will
decline as European demand drops because banks have tightened
financing to wind-park developers and the region’s sovereign
debt crisis has limited prospects for economic growth.  Vestas today fell 7.5 kroner ($1.39), or 4.3 percent to
168.9 kroner, at 11:51 a.m. in the Danish capital, its lowest
price since November 2006. The company has lost 52 percent of
its value in the past year, and 47 percent in 2010.  “It seems there’s an overly bad sentiment on Vestas shares
these days as it gets punished for just about anything that can
be interpreted as negative news,” said Sydbank’s Pedersen, who
is sticking to his “over-weight” rating on the stock.  Vestas said in its Oct. 26 third-earnings report that it
will close four factories in Denmark and Sweden and cut 3,000
European jobs as orders will decline next year by some 12
percent to a range of 7,000 megawatts to 8,000 megawatts. At
least 14 Vestas  analysts  have lowered their share price
estimates after the report, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
