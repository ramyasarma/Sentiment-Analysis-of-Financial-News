Copper, trading little changed, may
rebound as the dollar resumed a decline, boosting the appeal of
commodities as alternative investments.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange traded at $8,312 a metric ton by 8:01 a.m. in
Singapore. It fell as much as 2.9 percent to $8,266.50 a ton
yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
