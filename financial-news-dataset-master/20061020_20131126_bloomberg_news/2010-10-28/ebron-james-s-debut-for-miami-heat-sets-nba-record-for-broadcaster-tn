LeBron James’s  first game with the
Miami Heat attracted more than 7.4 million viewers, a record for
a regular-season National Basketball Association game on cable,
broadcaster  Turner Broadcasting System Inc.  said.  The Boston Celtics defeated the Heat 88-80 in yesterday’s
season opener.  The second game on TNT, in which the NBA-champion Los
Angeles Lakers beat the Houston Rockets 112-110, drew more than
3.7 million viewers.  The games together constituted the most-watched opening
night in TNT’s 27 years of covering the NBA.  Viewership was based on Nielsen Media Research Live.  To contact the reporter on this story:
