The euro’s gains risk encouraging
the European Central Bank to tighten monetary policy, a move
that would add pressure on so-called peripheral nations as they
cut their deficits, Schneider Foreign Exchange said.  “Excessive upward pressure on the euro and core-periphery
divergence on a number of levels could be the next test of the
glue that binds the euro zone together,” Stephen Gallo , head of
market analysis in London, wrote today in a research note.
“European policy makers need to be very mindful of the
willingness of some market participants to actively ‘test the
merits’ of the euro zone policy channels.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
