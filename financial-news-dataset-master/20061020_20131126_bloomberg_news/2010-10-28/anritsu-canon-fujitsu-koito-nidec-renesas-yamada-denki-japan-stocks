Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
fell 21.00, or 0.2 percent, to 9,366.03 as of the close in Tokyo.
The following were among the most active shares in the Japanese
 market  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company
names.  All Nippon Airways Co.  (9202 JT), Asia’s largest listed
carrier by sales, rose 2.7 percent to 304 yen. The company is
expected to report first-half operating profit of about 55
billion yen ($674 million), buoyed by recovering demand and cost
cuts, Nikkei English News reported.  Asahi Glass Co. (5201 JT), Japan’s biggest glass producer,
slid 4.2 percent to 781 yen, the lowest since Dec. 2. The
company may post a 70 percent year-on-year gain in operating
profit to about 53 billion yen for the July-September quarter,
Nikkei English News said. That is less than the 61 billion yen
earned for the April-June period because of a slowdown in the
LCD glass substrate market, the report said. Asahi Glass said in
a statement that it’s not source of the report and plans to
announce its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 5.  Canon Inc.  (7751 JT), the world’s largest camera maker,
advanced 3.7 percent to 3,755 yen. The company raised its full-
year net income forecast 2.1 percent to 245 billion yen, citing
cost cuts and higher camera shipments.  Central Japan Railway Co.  (9022 JT), the country’s biggest
high-speed train operator, rose 3.8 percent to 622,000 yen. The
company increased its full-year net income outlook 16 percent to

products, jumped 6.7 percent to 399 yen after raising its full-
year net income outlook 49 percent to 26 billion yen, citing
higher-than-expected demand for specialty steel materials.  Fanuc Ltd.  (6954 JT), Japan’s largest industrial robot
maker, jumped 5.5 percent to 11,850 yen, the highest since June
2008. The company’s stock-price estimate was boosted to 15,000
yen from 11,500 yen by Nomura Holdings Inc. At least seven
brokerages raised their target prices for Fanuc after the robot
maker yesterday said first-half net income jumped to 55.8
billion yen from 8.96 billion yen a year earlier as sales more
than doubled.  Fujitsu Ltd.  (6702 JT), Japan’s biggest computer-services
provider, rose 3.3 percent to 560 yen. The company said

9.8 percent to 730 yen, the lowest since March 2009. The company

2.4 billion yen as cost cuts are expected to fail to offset
losses from the stronger yen.  Kuraray Co.  (3405 JT), a fiber maker, increased 2.7 percent
to 1,129 yen after the company raised its full-year net income
projection 9.6 percent to 28.5 billion yen and its planned
dividend for the year to 27 yen from 24 yen.  Makita Corp.  (6586 JT), a maker of electric power tools,
gained 5.1 percent to 2,848 yen. The company raised its full-
year net income forecast by 26 percent to 25 billion yen as it
expects higher overseas sales to offset a stronger yen.  Medipal Holdings Corp.  (7459 JT), a maker of medical tools
and equipment, retreated 4 percent to 916 yen, the lowest since

equipment, sank 6.5 percent to 460 yen, the sharpest drop since

rose 9.2 percent to 6.45 billion yen on higher sales.  Renesas Electronics Corp.  (6723 JT), an electronic-
components maker, lost 7.8 percent to 631 yen, the lowest since
Dec. 15. The company said its first-half net loss widened to

value of fixed assets. Separately, Renesas said it plans to cut
1,200 jobs through early retirement.  Shinko Electric Industries Co.  (6967 JT), a maker of
semiconductor packages, slid 2.9 percent to 830 yen, the lowest
since February 2009. The company slashed its full-year net-
