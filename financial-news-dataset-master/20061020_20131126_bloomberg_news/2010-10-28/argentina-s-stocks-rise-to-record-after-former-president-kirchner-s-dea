Argentina’s main stock index rose to
a record as the death of former President  Nestor Kirchner 
bolstered speculation the opposition may win next year’s
election, leading to a more stable economy and reduced
government spending.  The Merval index rose 1 percent to 2,949.35 at 11:02 a.m.
New York time, after rising as much as 2.4 percent.  “The market is reacting to the behavior of American
depositary receipts on Wall Street yesterday after the local
holiday,”  Mariano Kruskevich , an analyst at SBS Sociedad de
Bolsa SA, said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires.
“ADRs did show a pullback yesterday later in the session, and
today the local market will show a summarized version of both
days.”  Local  trading  resumed after yesterday’s public holiday when
American depositary receipts of Argentine companies rallied. The
MSCI Argentina index fell 3.1 percent to 3,266.49, after rising
as much as 12.6 percent yesterday.  Kirchner, who carried out the harshest debt restructuring
since World War II before handing power to his wife,  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner , in 2007, died of a heart attack
yesterday, according to the presidential website.  Empresa Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte SA, or
Edenor, a power distributor, led  gains  on the Merval index, with
a 5.3 percent increase to 1.99 pesos, followed by  Banco Macro
SA , Argentina’s largest lender by market value, gaining 4.6
percent to 19.55 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
