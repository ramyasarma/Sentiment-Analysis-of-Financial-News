The New South Wales state
government’s 23 percent voter support is the lowest level of
any Labor party in power in Australia’s history, a Newspoll
opinion survey showed. The state’s opposition coalition has 46
percent support, according to a telephone survey of 1,274 voters
conducted in September and  October and published in the
Australian newspaper. About 42 percent of voters thought Barry
O’Farrell would be a better leader, compared with 35 percent for
Premier Kristina Keneally,accordping to the report. The poll has
a margin of error of 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
