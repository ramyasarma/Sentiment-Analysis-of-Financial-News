The cost of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose at a slower pace in the 12
months through September than a month earlier as a stronger rand
helped to curb import costs.  Producer-price inflation slowed to 6.8 percent from 7.8
percent in August, Pretoria-based  Statistics South Africa  said
on its website today. The  median estimate  of 17 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 8.2 percent. Prices fell 4.1 percent
in the month.  The rand has gained 9 percent against the dollar since June
1, lowering import prices and prompting the government to cut
gasoline costs by 1.2 percent on Sept. 1. Consumer-price
 inflation  eased to an annual 3.2 percent in September, close to
the lower end of the central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent
target range. That may give Governor  Gill Marcus  room to lower
interest rates for a third time this year.  “We continue to expect that the Reserve Bank will cut
interest rates by 50 basis points in November, but call for a 1
percentage-point cut instead to kick-start growth and reduce the
interest-rate differential driving rand strength,”  Annabel Bishop , an economist at Investec Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in
an e-mail.  The Reserve Bank cut its benchmark interest  rate  by half a
percentage point to 6 percent on Sept. 9, the eighth reduction
since December 2008. Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said
yesterday the rand’s strength will help to restrain inflation
and that businesses would welcome lower interest rates.  The rand was at 7.0394 against the dollar as of 12:22 p.m.
in Johannesburg, little changed from 7.0325 before the data was
released. The yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, fell
11 basis points to 7.12 percent today.  Producer costs fell in the month as electricity tariffs
were lowered at the end of winter, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
