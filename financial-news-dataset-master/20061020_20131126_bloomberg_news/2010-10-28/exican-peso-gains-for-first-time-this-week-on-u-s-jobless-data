Mexico’s peso rose for the first
time this week as initial jobless claims in the U.S., the
nation’s largest trading partner, unexpectedly dropped.  The peso increased 0.7 percent to 12.3619 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.4516 yesterday. The currency has
gained 5.9 percent this year and 1.9 percent this month. The
peso is poised for a second month of gains.  “The headline figure was the opposite of what everyone was
expecting,” said  Bertrand Delgado , an economist at Roubini
Global Economics LLC in New York. “The start of the day has
been pro risk trading, not only for the peso, but for other
currencies as well.”  U.S. initial jobless claims decreased by 21,000 to 434,000
in the week ending Oct. 23, the lowest since early July, the
Labor Department said today. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent
of Mexico’s exports. Economists had forecast claims would rise
to 455,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.32 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price on the security rose
0.80 centavos to 134.29 centavos on the peso.  A “steep rise” in drug-related violence over the past 3
years to 4 years is “concerning” and may cause market
volatility, RBC Capital Markets said in an e-mailed note today.  Moves by some countries to stem the gains of their
currencies, a so-called currency war, may cause currency
instability, said central bank Governor  Agustin Carstens , in an
interview with Radio Formula.  Brazil has tripled its taxes on foreigner’s fixed-income
purchases to 6 percent to pare the currency’s gain. The real has
gained 36 percent since the end of 2008.  Mexico doesn’t favor a tax similar to Brazil’s, Carstens
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
