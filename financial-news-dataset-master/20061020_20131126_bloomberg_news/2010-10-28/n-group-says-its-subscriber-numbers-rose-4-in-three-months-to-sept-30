MTN Group Ltd ., Africa’s largest
mobile-phone company, said subscriber numbers rose 4 percent in
the quarter through September from the preceding three months.  MTN had 134.5 million subscribers in total, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today.
Subscribers increased 5.1 percent to 36.8 million in Nigeria.  Mobile data and mobile money applications bolstered the
company’s performance, the statement said. The company is facing
“aggressive” competition and increased regulation, it said.  West and Central Africa contributed 46 percent of total
users. Nigeria accounts for 60 percent of this region. South and
East Africa contributed 22 percent of total users at 30.1
million. Middle East and North Africa contributed 32 percent at
43 million users. MTN Irancell grew by 5.6 percent to 28.5
million users, the company said.  Average revenue per user ”remained relatively stable in
local currency when compared to June 2010,” the company said.
Guidance on net additions for the year has been revised to 22.9
million from 21.2 million given at Dec. 31, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
