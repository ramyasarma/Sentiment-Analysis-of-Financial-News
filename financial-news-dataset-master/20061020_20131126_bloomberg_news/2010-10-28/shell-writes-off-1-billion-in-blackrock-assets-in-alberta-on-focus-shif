Royal Dutch Shell Plc  wrote off
about $1 billion in assets held by its BlackRock Ventures Inc.
unit in Canada after evaluating the resources and shifting its
focus to other northern Alberta projects.  Shell plans to develop the Carmon Creek project in Canada’s
Peace River area and expand capacity at the Athabasca Oil Sands
Project, said Chief Financial Officer  Simon Henry . It acquired
BlackRock, based in Calgary, for about $2 billion in 2006 to
access Canadian heavy oil reserves.  The Hague-based Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, had
“quite a detailed review of this sub-surface” asset “and
overall they look less good than we’ve previously expected,”
Henry told reporters on a conference call today. “The BlackRock
in-situ assets are much lower down on the priority list.”  Shell plans to increase output of heavy crude by 60 percent
through 2020 in the Americas. It extracted about 170,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day last year in the region, John Abbott,
executive vice president for heavy oil,  said  Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
