S-Oil Corp. , South Korea’s third-
biggest oil refiner, said third-quarter profit more than
tripled, beating estimates, as margins from processing crude
into diesel increased with rising fuel demand.  Net income  rose to 243.7 billion won ($216 million) in the
quarter from a revised 78.9 billion won a year earlier, the
Seoul-based company said in a regulatory filing today. The mean
of 11 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg News was a profit
of 231.9 billion won.  South Korea’s economy will likely expand around 6 percent
in 2010 and domestic demand is increasingly boosting growth,
Bank of Korea Director General Kim Myung Kee said yesterday.
This may help support profits at the country’s refiners as
winter approaches.  “Refiners’ earnings in the fourth quarter will be stable
as margins keep improving on winter demand,” said  Yoo Young Kuk , an analyst at KTB Securities Co.  S-Oil  shares , which are up 32 percent this year, gained 0.6
percent to 71,200 won as of 9:51 a.m. in Seoul trading. The
benchmark Kospi index increased 0.2 percent.  Returns from processing fuel oil into diesel rose to $12.40
a barrel in the quarter from $6.90 a year earlier, while jet
fuel margins were $12.9 a barrel from $7.3 a barrel, according
to the company.  S-Oil’s bigger rival,  SK Energy Co. , last week reported a
36 percent increase in third-quarter profit.  Operating profit amounted to 171.8 billion won, compared
with a loss of 57 billion won a year earlier, while sales rose
9.7 percent to 5.17 trillion won in the quarter, S-Oil said.  The company’s refining division reported operating profit
of 52.1 billion won in the quarter after an operating loss of
180.3 billion won a year earlier.  Operating profit in its petrochemical business fell 98
percent as product prices declined after rivals in China and the
Middle East increased output. S-Oil’s lubricant division’s
operating profit was up 82 percent to 118.6 billion won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
