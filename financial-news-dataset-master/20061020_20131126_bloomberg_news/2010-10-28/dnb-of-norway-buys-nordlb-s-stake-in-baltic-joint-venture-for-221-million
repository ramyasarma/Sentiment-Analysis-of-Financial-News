DnB NOR ASA, Norway’s largest bank,
has agreed to buy Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale’s 49
percent stake in their DnB NORD A/S joint venture in the Baltic
countries and Poland for 160 million euros ($221 million) in
cash, the Oslo-based lender said in a statement today.  “The Baltic states and Poland have higher growth potential
than Western Europe, and DnB NOR wishes to grow within the
retail banking segment in these countries to realise its general
growth ambitions,” it said. “We are also seeing clear signs
that the macroeconomic situation in the Baltic states is
improving, and the Polish economy has been among the strongest
in Europe throughout the financial crisis.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
