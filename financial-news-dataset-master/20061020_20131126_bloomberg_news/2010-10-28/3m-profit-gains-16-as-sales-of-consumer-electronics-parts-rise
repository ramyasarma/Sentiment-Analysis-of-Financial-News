3M Co. , the maker of Scotch tape and
optical films used to brighten TV screens, fell the most since
May in New York trading after cutting its 2010 profit forecast
and saying pension expenses will be higher next year.  3M shaved 6 cents off the top end of full-year profit
because of acquisitions announced during the quarter, according
to a statement from the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company.
Pension costs will be about 30 cents a share higher next year,
3M said.  3M had said the purchases would initially decrease
earnings. The shares fell because the company didn’t boost its
projection like other manufacturers have done, said  Steve Winoker , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York.
3M narrowed its forecast range, lifting the low end by 5 cents.  Investors “are looking for beat and raise, in a clean
fashion,” Winoker, who rates 3M “outperform,” said in an
interview. “They didn’t get a clean raise at the midpoint from
3M. 3M took up the low end, but also took down the high end.”  Parker Hannifin Corp. on Oct. 19 boosted its fiscal 2011
profit forecast amid a rebound in U.S. manufacturing and
Honeywell International Inc. on Oct. 22 increased its full-year
 forecast  on higher sales of car and plane parts.  3M, whose products range from Post-It Notes to sanding
belts, dropped $6.26, or 6.9 percent, to $84.11 at 12:12 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The  shares  earlier
fell to $83.86 for the steepest intraday drop since May 6. The
decline was the most among the 30 stocks in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average .  Cogent, Attenti  The company is buying Cogent Inc., a maker of fingerprint
identification systems; Attenti Holdings SA, a maker of
electronic tracking tools including ankle bracelets; and Arizant
Inc., a maker of blankets used to protect hospital patients
against hypothermia.  The company sees full-year profit of at most $5.74 a share,
compared with a previous forecast of as much as $5.80.  Third-quarter net income advanced 16 percent to $1.11
billion, or $1.53 a share, exceeding analysts’ estimates by 2
cents, as sales of consumer-electronics components climbed.  Revenue increased 11 percent to $6.87 billion, helped by
emerging markets. Almost two-thirds of the company’s sales are
from outside the U.S.  Analysts , on average, estimated $6.79
billion, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
