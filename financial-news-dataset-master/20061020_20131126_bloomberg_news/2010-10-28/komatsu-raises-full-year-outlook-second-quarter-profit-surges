Komatsu Ltd., the world’s second-
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, raised its
full-year earnings outlook after posting a 9.6-fold jump in
second quarter profit as economies expanded in Asia.  Net income will probably be 120 billion yen ($1.5 billion)
for the year ending March 2011, compared with a July 13 estimate
of a 105 billion yen profit, the Tokyo-based company said today
in a statement. Sales may rise 23 percent to 1.76 trillion yen,
higher than its July 13 forecast of 1.72 trillion yen.  Komatsu joins  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.  in raising
its full-year profit forecast.  Caterpillar Inc. , the world’s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, last week
raised its full-year earnings forecast as demand grows in
emerging markets such as China and Brazil.  Profit  for the fiscal second-quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to
33.1 billion yen from 3.44 billion yen a year earlier, Komatsu
said. Sales rose 27 percent to 412.6 billion yen in the period.  Hitachi Construction, Japan’s second-largest maker of
excavators, raised its full-year net income forecast by 43
percent to 10 billion yen on Oct. 22 and reported first-half net
income of 3.1 billion yen this week.  Demand in Asia has helped offset a stronger yen that makes
heavy machines built by Komatsu less competitive than
international rivals such as Caterpillar.  Komatsu said today it based its foreign exchange rate of 82
yen to the dollar for the second half, as the Japanese currency
climbed as high as 80.41 yen per dollar this week, the highest
since April 1995.  Komatsu  shares  closed down 0.9 percent to 1,937 yen at 3
p.m. in Tokyo. The result was announced after the market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
