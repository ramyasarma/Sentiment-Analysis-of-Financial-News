Sierra Leone has become the first
country to remove foreign-owned vessels from its international
ship’s register and has also prohibited foreign-owned vessels
from using the country’s flag of convenience, in a bid to curb
illegal fishing.  Vessels flying the Sierra Leone flag with no genuine links
with the country have hurt the nation’s reputation by engaging
in illegal fishing practices, Joseph Mano Koroma, the minister
of fisheries and marine resources, told reporters today. The
country also estimates it loses between $29 million and $30
million annually from unreported and unregulated pirate fishing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
