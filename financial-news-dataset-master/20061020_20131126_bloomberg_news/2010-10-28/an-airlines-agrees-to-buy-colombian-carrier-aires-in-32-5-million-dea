Lan Airlines SA , Latin America’s
biggest carrier by market value, agreed to buy Colombia’s
Aerovias de Integracion Regional SA in a $32.5 million deal.  Lan Airlines will acquire 99 percent of the airline known
as Aires through the purchase of its controlling shareholders,
it wrote in a statement posted today on the website of Chile’s
securities regulator.  Lan Airlines, which is expanding in Latin America as
regional passenger and cargo traffic recovers, plans to invest
$7.72 billion through 2018 to more than double its fleet and
agreed to buy Brazil’s Tam SA on Aug. 13. Aires, the second-
largest operator in Colombia’s domestic market, would be become
part of LATAM Airlines, the company to be formed from the Lan-
Tam tie-up.  The acquisition of Aires, which is subject to a due
diligence and regulatory authorizations, may be completed in 30
days to 60 days, Lan said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
