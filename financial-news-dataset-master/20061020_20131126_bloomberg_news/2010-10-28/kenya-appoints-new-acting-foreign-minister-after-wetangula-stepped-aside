Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki
appointed George Saitoti as acting foreign minister, his office
said.  Saitoti will also continue in his current capacity as
minister of internal security and provincial administration, the
president said in an e-mailed statement today from Nairobi, the
capital.  Yesterday, Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula said he would
temporarily relinquish his post pending a parliamentary probe
into alleged corruption.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
