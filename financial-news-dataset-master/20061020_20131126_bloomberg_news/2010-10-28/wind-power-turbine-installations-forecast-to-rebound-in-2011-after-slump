Wind turbine installations will
bounce back in 2011 after stalling this year, according to a
report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Turbines with an electricity-generation capacity of 45
gigawatts are likely to be erected next year, up from about 37.7
gigawatts this year, the London-based research group said today.
Next year’s activity will be dominated by  China , said Eduardo Tabbush, a New Energy Finance wind industry analyst.  “We expect a rebound in installations for 2011 mainly
driven by growth in China,” Tabbush said. “This will account
for about 50 percent of annual installations that year.”  A collapse in investment at the end of 2008 and start of
2009 has led to this year’s decline in installations, which lag
financings, according to New Energy Finance Chief Executive
Officer Michael Liebreich. Last year, about 38.4 gigawatts of
turbines were installed.  The analysis company also cut forecasts for onshore
installations this year from the 41.3 gigawatts predicted in
February and 40.5 gigawatts in June. It now predicts 36.4
gigawatts of power this year on land and 1.3 gigawatts offshore.  “Projects with expected completion this year are not
expected until 2011 either due to the increased time taken to
close financing and power purchase agreements, such as in the
U.S. and U.K., or due to policy uncertainties, such as in Canada
and  Australia ,” Tabbush said.  U.S. installations probably will fall 39 percent this year,
weighed down by lower prices for power and natural gas and by
uncertainty about the level of regulatory support for
renewables, New Energy Finance said.  “Investment levels are slowly recovering in  Europe  and the
U.S., but meanwhile  Asia , and in particular China, have charged
ahead,” Liebreich said.  A megawatt is enough power for about 800 typical U.S.
homes, according to the Energy Information Administration. There
are 1,000 megawatts in a gigawatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
