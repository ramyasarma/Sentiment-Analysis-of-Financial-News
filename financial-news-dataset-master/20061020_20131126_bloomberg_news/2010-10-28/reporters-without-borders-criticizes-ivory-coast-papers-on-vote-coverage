Ivory Coast ’s privately owned
newspapers are showing “disturbing excesses” in their
political coverage before the West African nation’s presidential
election on Oct. 31, Reporters Without Borders said.  The Paris-based press monitoring group said the Le
Patriote, le Nouveau Reveil and Notre Voie newspapers have
employed “outrageous language and hyperbole” that has been
“excessive and contrary to the standards of professional
journalism.”  Le Patriote wrote of an “unpunished genocide” by President
 Laurent Gbagbo , who is running for re-election, while Notre Voie
accused candidate  Alassane Ouattara  of “protecting those who
robbed the peasants,” the group said in a  statement .  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, has been
split into a rebel-held north and a government-controlled south
since insurgents rebelled in 2002, accusing the authorities of
discriminating against northern Muslims.  Reporters Without Borders urged the newspapers “to
immediately change their approach to the election campaign by
providing their readers with balanced and responsible reporting
and thereby contributing in a positive manner to the plurality
of the democratic debate in Côte d’Ivoire.”  Election coverage by public radio and TV stations favors
Gbagbo, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
