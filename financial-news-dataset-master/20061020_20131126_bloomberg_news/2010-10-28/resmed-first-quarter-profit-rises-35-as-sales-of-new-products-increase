ResMed Inc. , the world’s second-
biggest maker of machines to overcome nighttime breathing
disorders, had a 35 percent jump in fiscal first-quarter profit,
spurred by sales of its new S9 devices for sleep apnea.  Net income  rose to $56.7 million, or 36 cents, in the three
months ended Sept. 30, from $42.1 million, or 27 cents, a year
ago, ResMed said in a statement today. Profit at the Poway,
California-based company beat the $49.3 million average of eight
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales increased for the
63rd consecutive quarter, climbing 14 percent to $282 million.  ResMed, which manufactures in  Australia  and generates about
half its sales in the U.S., said revenue in the Americas
increased 16 percent to $156 million. Sales were boosted by
demand for the new S9 Autoset and Elite products that regulate
breathing for people with sleep apnea. One in five adults has
the choking condition, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.  “The findings from recent clinical studies continue to
demonstrate the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep-
disordered breathing,”  Kieran T. Gallahue , president and chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  ResMed, established more than 20 years ago on research by
 Colin Sullivan  at the University of Sydney, added  2.4 percent  to
A$3.41 at the 4 p.m. close on the Australian stock exchange. The
shares have gained 15 percent this year, compared with a 4.3
percent drop in the benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 index .  Obstructive sleep apnea is exacerbated by obesity and
causes sufferers to momentarily stop breathing for as many as
several hundred times a night, according to the company’s
website. Respironics is the world’s largest maker of devices
that treat chronic breathing disorders and aid sleep. Amsterdam-
based Royal Philips Electronics NV acquired Respironics in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
