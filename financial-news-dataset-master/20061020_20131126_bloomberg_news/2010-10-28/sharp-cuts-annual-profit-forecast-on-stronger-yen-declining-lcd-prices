Sharp Corp. , Japan’s largest maker
of liquid-crystal displays, cut its annual profit forecast by 40
percent, citing the stronger yen and falling prices of panels.  Net income will probably total 30 billion yen ($367 million)
in the year to March 2011, down from its previous forecast of 50
billion yen, the Osaka-based company said in a statement.
Operating income, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, may be about 90 billion yen, compared
with an earlier forecast of 120 billion yen, it said.  Sharp, which started a new plant last year in Sakai,
western Japan, slashed production of LCD panels two months ago
due to slowing demand. The company will likely struggle to boost
earnings as a glut for the device will likely worsen during the
second-fiscal half, Shunsuke Tsuchiya, a Tokyo-based analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG, said before the announcement.  The maker of Aquos-brand TVs “appears to be wavering in a
decision whether it should focus just on panel operations rather
than consumer products,” the analyst said.  Sharp rose 0.2 percent to 844 yen in Tokyo  trading  before
the announcement. The stock has lost 28 percent this year,
compared with the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average’s 11
percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
