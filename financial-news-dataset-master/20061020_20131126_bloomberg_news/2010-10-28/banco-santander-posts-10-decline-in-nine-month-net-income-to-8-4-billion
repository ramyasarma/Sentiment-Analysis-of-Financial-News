Banco Santander SA, (SAN)  the biggest
Spanish bank, will miss its 2010 earnings goal after rules
forcing the company to recognize bad loans more quickly led to
the lowest quarterly profit in more than four years.  Santander fell as much as 2.1 percent in  Madrid  trading
after saying it will miss a forecast for profit in 2010 similar
to last year’s 8.94 billion euros ($12.4 billion). Third-quarter
 net income  slipped 26 percent to 1.64 billion euros, the lowest
level since the first quarter of 2006.  The bank, based in Santander, Spain, agreed to spend $10
billion since June on a Polish lender and assets in the U.K.,
the U.S. and  Germany  as Chairman Emilio Botin diversifies across
the bank’s 10 main markets and reduces dependence on Spain.
While earnings rose in  Brazil  and Britain, profit fell at home,
where funding costs have risen and the bank set aside 472
million euros to meet a Bank of Spain order to account for bad
loans sooner.  “I’ve always thought the Spanish economy and the real
estate market is in bad shape and I’m not convinced it’s over
yet,” said Peter Braendle, who holds Santander shares as part
of the $61 billion he helps manage at Swisscanto Asset
Management in Zurich. “One thing I like about Santander is the
diversification of its earnings, but as we can see, Spain is
still the problem.”  Sliding Stock  Santander’s stock fell 3.3 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
9.15 euros in Madrid. The shares have fallen 20 percent this
year, compared with a 3.7 percent drop in the 53-member
Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain’s second-biggest
lender, has declined 27 percent this year. The Bilbao-based bank
posted a 17 percent drop in quarterly  profit  yesterday.  Santander opted not to release as much as 725 million euros
in reserves, applying the “most conservative” interpretation
of the new rule as it increased loan-loss provisions. The
central bank rule, announced in May, speeds up the calendar for
covering unpaid loans and acquired or repossessed real estate.
Stripping out the impact of the new regulations, net income in
the quarter would have been 2.11 billion euros, the bank said.  Total shareholder remuneration for 2010 will stay at 60
cents a share, unchanged from last year, Santander said. Net
interest income rose 8.4 percent to 7.4 billion euros.  The bank doesn’t have any acquisition plans for now and
will target core capital of 9 percent at the end of 2011 to be
comfortable with the requirements of Basel III regulations,
Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Saenz said on a webcast for
analysts today. The core capital ratio slipped to 8.5 percent in
September from 8.6 percent in June.  Bad Debt  Bad loans as a proportion of total loans rose to 3.42
percent from 3.37 percent in June and 3.03 percent a year ago,
Santander said.  Loans newly classified as in default fell to 2.9 billion
euros from 3.4 billion euros in the previous quarter as total
bad loans reached 27.2 billion euros, a 20 percent increase from
a year ago. Defaults may not reach their peak until mid-2011,
Saenz said.  Santander has 15.5 billion euros in what the Bank of Spain
terms “troubled” assets related to real estate, out of 181
billion euros for the industry as a whole. The share of 8.6
percent compares with its 15 percent share of lending in Spain,
the bank said.  Profit from Santander’s Spanish retail network fell to 83
million euros from 469 million euros.  Banco Espanol de Credito
SA (BTO) , a Santander-owned retail bank in Spain run by Botin’s
daughter, Ana Patricia Botin, said on Oct. 7 that its quarterly
profit fell 52 percent.  Earnings from  Brazil (SANB11) , a country that Botin predicts will
contribute more profit than Spain this year, jumped to 785
million euros from 628 million euros as lending increased 29
percent. Profit from the U.K. climbed 23 percent to 527 million
euros.  To contact the reporter for this story:
