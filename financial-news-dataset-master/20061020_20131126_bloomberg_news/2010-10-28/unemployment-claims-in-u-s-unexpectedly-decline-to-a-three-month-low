Applications for U.S. unemployment
benefits unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level in
three months, a signal the labor market may be starting to mend.  Initial jobless  claims  decreased by 21,000 to 434,000 in
the week ended Oct. 23, the lowest since early July when fewer
auto plants than normal closed for retooling, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. The total number of people
receiving unemployment insurance dropped to a two-year low,
while those getting extended payments also fell.  Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of
the economy, is beginning to gain speed and may give companies
reason to increase payrolls heading into the holiday shopping
season.  Ford Motor Co . is among companies planning to add staff
as sales improve.  “Job growth is modest right now, but it should improve,”
Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in
Holland, Pennsylvania, said before the report. “People will be
surprised at how much better the labor market looks like in six
months.”  Stock-index futures added to earlier gains after the
report. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring
in December rose 0.6 percent to 1,186.2 at 8:36 a.m. in New
York. Treasury securities also rose, sending the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note down to 2.70 percent from 2.72 percent
late yesterday.  Holiday Adjustment  The unadjusted data showed a 3 percent increase in claims
in the week following the Columbus Day holiday period, smaller
than the 7.9 percent rise that usually occurs, a Labor
Department spokesman told reporters as the figures were being
released. For that reason, the seasonally adjusted figure showed
a decrease.  Economists forecast claims would increase to 455,000 from a
previously reported 452,000 for the prior week, according to the
 median  of 47 projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates
ranged from 430,000 to 464,000.  The four-week moving average of claims, a less volatile
measure, fell to 453,250, also the lowest since July, from
458,750. Fewer auto plants than usual closed for model-year
retooling in July, pushing down the level of claims that month.
Prior to July, the last time claims were this low was in August
2008.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
fell by 122,000 in the week ended Oct. 16 to 4.36 million, the
fewest since November 2008.  Fewer Extended Benefits  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended and  emergency  benefits under
federal programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional
benefits and are now collecting emergency and extended payments
decreased by about 414,100 to 4.66 million in the week ended
Oct. 9.  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 3.5 percent for a
third week in the period ended Oct. 16.  Eleven states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 42 reported a decline. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Companies in September added 64,000 workers, while total
payrolls that include government agencies fell a larger-than-
forecast 95,000, Labor Department figures showed Oct. 8.  Voter Discontent  The economy is forefront in Americans’ minds as the Nov. 2
Congressional elections approach. Forty-three percent of
respondents to a Gallup Inc. poll released this week rated
economic conditions as the most important of four issues in
considering in how they would vote.  Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, plans to invest
$850 million and add 1,200 jobs in Michigan by 2013 as sales
rebound, the company said Oct. 25. It will add 900 hourly
positions in its factories and 300 salaried jobs at its
engineering and manufacturing operations, it said.  Other companies are still paring staff. United Technologies
Corp., the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Carrier air
conditioners, plans to cut about 3,300 jobs as part of its cost-
reduction efforts announced this year. It eliminated 1,300
positions in the first nine months of this year and is targeting
the rest through 2011, it said in a quarterly filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
