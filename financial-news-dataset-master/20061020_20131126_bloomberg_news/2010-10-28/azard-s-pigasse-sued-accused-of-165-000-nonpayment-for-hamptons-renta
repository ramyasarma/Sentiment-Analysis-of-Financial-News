Matthieu Pigasse  , vice chairman for
Europe of  Lazard Ltd. , was sued for at least $165,000 for
“ditching” a Hamptons luxury rental after two days without
paying.  The banker agreed to rent the Norman Jaffe-designed
beachfront home at 2170 Meadow Lane in Southampton, New York,
for $165,000 for a three-week period in August, according to a
complaint filed Oct. 26 in New York State Supreme Court by
Kandinsky Escape LLC, owner of the property.  Pigasse, who lives in Paris, arrived at the five-bedroom,
five-bath Hamptons home on Aug. 4 with his family and left after
two days, court papers say. He also misrepresented that he had
wired a security deposit of $25,000, according to the complaint.  “This is an action for breach of contract, fraud and
unjust enrichment” arising from Pigasse’s “tactless conduct in
ditching of plaintiff’s Hamptons luxury rental home after only a
two-day stay without paying any rent or a security deposit, as
promised,” according to the complaint.  Pigasse didn’t immediately return a call to his Paris
office for comment.  Kandinksy also sued broker Jack Prizzi and Prudential
Douglas Elliman Real Estate, real estate brokers for the
property.  Reached on his mobile phone, Prizzi declined to comment.
Barbara Wagner, a spokeswoman for Prudential, also declined to
comment.  ‘Beachfront Perfection’  According to a  listing  on the Prudential Douglas Elliman
website, 2170 Meadow Lane has “dramatic panoramic views of the
Atlantic Ocean,” 200 feet of “beachfront perfection,” a
gunite pool and spa and 4.2 acres that “insure privacy.”  Lazard, an investment bank based in Bermuda, is the biggest
independent merger adviser.  The case is Kandinsky Escape v. Pigasse, 651846/2010, New
York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
