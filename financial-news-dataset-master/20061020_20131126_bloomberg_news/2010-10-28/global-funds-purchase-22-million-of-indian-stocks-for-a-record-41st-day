Overseas  investors  were net buyers
of Indian equities for a 41st day yesterday, the longest streak
on record, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Global funds bought a net  977 million rupees  ($22 million)
of shares, extending this year’s record inflows to 1.135
trillion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of India said.  Investors bought 27.74 billion rupees of shares and sold
26.77 billion rupees,  data  show. Funds sold a net 7.44 billion
rupees of bonds, taking total debt purchases this year to 453.5
billion rupees.  Overseas investment has pushed the benchmark  Sensitive
Index  to the highest level in more than 2 1/2 years and helped
the rupee jump 6 percent in the past 12 months. Stock purchases
this year include 297 billion rupees from the primary market.  Foreign  investors  have invested 4.27 trillion rupees in
stocks and 776.1 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed
into the country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when
flows reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest rally
in 18 years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from
stocks in 2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
