Telenet Group Holding NV , the
Belgian cable operator controlled by  John Malone ’s Liberty
Global Inc., raised its forecast for cash generation and will
add to borrowings to accommodate future shareholder payouts.  Telenet will generate more than 225 million euros ($312
million) of cash not required for reinvestment this year, up
from a previous prediction of more than 200 million euros and
166.9 million euros last year, the Mechelen, Belgium-based
company said today in a statement. Separately, Telenet said it
will borrow an additional 350 million euros due in 2020 to
redeem shorter-term loans and help fund future  payouts .  The cable operator won’t face any  debt redemptions  before
December 2014 following an exchange offer of term loans that
ended Oct. 4 and the placement of the 10-year high-yield notes,
spokesman  Rob Goyens  said by phone today. Telenet will pay out
“at least 100 percent” of free cash flow to shareholders,
Chief Financial Officer  Renaat Berckmoes  told analysts on an
Aug. 3 conference call.  “Shareholders are assured of continued high cash
returns,”  Nico Melsens , an analyst at KBC Securities NV in
Brussels, wrote in an investor note. “Keep in mind that in
August Telenet paid out 250 million euros through a capital
reduction.” Melsens raised his six-month price estimate for the
shares to 28 euros from 25 euros.  Telenet climbed as much as 6.2 percent in Brussels  trading ,
the biggest intraday advance since May 10, and rose 1.39 euros
to 28 euros at 10:08 a.m. local time. The shares have gained 40
percent since the start of the year.  Third-quarter  profit  excluding markdowns of interest-rate
derivatives rose to 37 million euros from 29.4 million euros a
year earlier, beating the 33.8 million-euro average of 10
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue advanced 7.8
percent to 328.4 million euros, the  slowest growth  rate in two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
