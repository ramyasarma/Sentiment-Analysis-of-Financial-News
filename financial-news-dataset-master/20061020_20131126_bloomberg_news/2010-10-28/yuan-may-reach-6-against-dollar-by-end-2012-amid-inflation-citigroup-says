China’s higher inflation and
tightening bias support faster yuan appreciation, according to
Citigroup Inc.  The non-deliverable forwards market is implying too little
appreciation, Ken Peng and Minggao Shen, Hong Kong-based
analysts, wrote in a report dated today. They expect the yuan to
appreciate to 6.25 against the dollar by the end of next year
and to 6 by the end of 2012.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
