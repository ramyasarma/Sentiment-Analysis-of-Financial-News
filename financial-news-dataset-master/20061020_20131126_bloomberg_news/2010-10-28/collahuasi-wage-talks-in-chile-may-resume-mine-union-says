Workers at  Anglo American Plc  and
 Xstrata Plc’s  Collahuasi copper mine, the world’s fourth-
biggest, are prepared to continue wage negotiations in Chile
after rejecting a company offer, a union official said.  “If the company is willing to talk, then we will talk,”
Juan Antonio Barraza, the union’s secretary, said in an
interview from the town of Iquique, where many of Collahuasi’s
workers voted yesterday.  Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi , as the mine’s operating
company is known, requested mediated negotiations at Chile’s
Work Inspectorate earlier today, a measure that will delay any
strike by five working days, spokeswoman Bernardita Fernandez
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Workers rejected the proposal, which included a bonus of
8.9 million pesos ($18,000) each, by 1,415 out of 1,422 votes
case, the union said late yesterday from Iquique. Extending
talks using the government mediator would delay the start of a
strike until Nov. 4, Barraza said.  The Collahuasi mine located near Chile’s border with
Bolivia in the Andes Mountains is unrelated to the San Jose
copper mine where the rescue of 33 miners was watched by
millions of people across the world earlier this month.  Collahuasi produced 535,000 metric tons of copper last
year, or 3.5 percent of world output, according to Standard Bank
Plc. Anglo American and Xstrata each own 44 percent of the mine
and a group led by Mitsui & Co. holds the rest.  Copper futures for December delivery rose 1.2 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close at $3.7875 a pound at 1:31 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. Yesterday, the price reached $3.90, the highest
level for a most-active contract since July 7, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
