The outflow of funds from Namibia to
South Africa is too high, Ipumbu Shiimi, the country’s central
bank governor, said in an address in Windhoek, the country’s
capital, today.  Inflows have risen from 7.7 billion Namibian dollars ($1.1
billion) last year to 8.9 billion Namibian dollars so far this
year, he said.  “This trend must stop,” Shiimi said. “This trend is not
sustainable for a country that aspires to be a developed nation
by 2030.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
