SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.  pulled a
C$900 million ($878 million) initial public offering and
scrapped plans to increase its holding in the 407 toll highway,
paving the way for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to
buy the stake.  SNC-Lavalin canceled the planned IPO for TransAxio Highway
Concession Inc., which was created to buy 7.65 percent of the
407 Express Toll Route outside Toronto. The IPO, which was
expected to raise C$850 million to C$900 million, was pulled due
to “adverse market conditions,” according to today’s
statement.  SNC-Lavalin, which owns about 17 percent of the highway,
said it won’t exercise its right to buy another 10 percent stake
from partner  Ferrovial SA  of Spain. That may allow Canada
Pension to complete a deal it negotiated earlier this month.  Ferrovial’s Cintra Infraestructuras unit, owner of 53
percent of 407 International Inc., agreed on Oct. 5 to sell 10
percent to Toronto-based Canada Pension for C$894 million.
Canada Pension is also spending A$3.44 billion ($3.36 billion)
to buy Sydney-based Intoll Group, which owns 30 percent of the
road.  “We’re pleased that our previously announced transaction
with Ferrovial/Cintra will move forward,” Canada Pension
spokeswoman  Linda Sims  said in an e-mailed statement.  Premium Price  TransAxio’s offer would have been as much as a 32 percent
premium to Canada Pension’s price. TransAxio’s C$900 million
offer for a 7.65 percent stake valued the highway at about
C$11.8 billion, while Canada Pension’s agreement pegged the
price at about C$8.9 billion.  CIBC World Markets, a unit of  Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce , was leading a group of 12 banks on the TransAxio sale,
according to the filing. SNC-Lavalin spokeswoman Claudia Martin
declined to comment.  Companies have cancelled or postponed at least 11 IPOs in
Canada this year, even as stock prices rally. Airline Porter
Aviation Holdings Inc. and Lulu Ltd., a self-publisher, scrapped
their IPOs while others have been forced to cut the size of
their offerings.  Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc., owner of the Canadian ski
resort that hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, today reduced the
share price range for its C$300 million IPO, according to two
people familiar with the sale. Whistler Blackcomb aims to sell
shares for between C$12.50 and C$13 each, down from its initial
range of C$14 to C$15.  Higher Yield  The cut raises the dividend yield to between 7.5 percent
and 7.8 percent, up from the initial target of 6.5 percent to 7
percent. Intrawest ULC, a unit of New York-based buyout firm
 Fortress Investment Group LLC , is the selling shareholder behind
the offering, which is led by CIBC World Markets and RBC
Dominion Securities.  Whistler Blackcomb spokeswoman Tabetha Boot didn’t
immediately respond to a telephone message.  Global Packaging Plus Inc., a California maker of plastic
packaging, last week cut its offering to about C$92.5 million as
part of a sale of the business by owner Berkley Industries LLC.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index has risen 7.9
percent in the last three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
