Sugar prices rose to an eight-month
high after floods hurt crops in Thailand, the world’s second-
biggest exporter. Cotton fell for the second straight day.  About 2.5 percent of Thailand’s cane-growing area was
damaged in the country’s worst flooding in five decades, the
Office of the Cane and Sugar Board said. In October, futures in
New York have jumped 22 percent, heading for the fifth straight
monthly gain.  “The fundamentals are bullish,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an
analyst at Transworld Futures in Tampa, Florida. “Funds are
actively buying.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.12 cent, or 0.4
percent, to settle at 28.71 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 29.59
cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since Feb.
3.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
their net-long position, or bets on rising prices, in futures by
5 percent in the week ended Oct. 19 from a week earlier to the
highest level since March, according to government data.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery
advanced $16.30, or 2.3 percent, to $729.30 a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Cotton futures for December delivery fell 1.91 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $1.2168 a pound in New York. Yesterday, the
commodity fell 4.6 percent, the biggest decline in 14 months.  Inventories  monitored by ICE climbed for the fourth
straight day and are up 38 percent since Oct. 8.  In October, cotton has jumped 19 percent, heading for the
biggest monthly gain since February, on concern that adverse
weather in the U.S. and China eroded prospects for crops.  Cotton has climbed 61 percent this year, reaching a record
$1.305 on Oct. 26, after global demand outpaced dwindling
supplies. The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
