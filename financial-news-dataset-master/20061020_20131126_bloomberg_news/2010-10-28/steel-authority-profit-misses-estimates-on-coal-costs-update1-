Steel Authority of India Ltd. , the
nation’s second-biggest producer, posted a worse-than-estimated
34 percent drop in second-quarter profit as rising costs of
coking coal and other raw materials outweighed price increases.  Net  income  fell to 10.9 billion rupees ($245 million), or
2.64 rupees a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from
16.6 billion rupees, or 4.03 rupees, a year earlier, the New
Delhi-based company said today in a statement. That compares
with the 14 billion rupee average of 10 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 7 percent to 106 billion
rupees.  Coking coal, a key ingredient used in steelmaking, rose 74
percent in the quarter from a year earlier after suppliers
including Vale SA, Rio Tinto Ltd. and BHP Billiton Ltd. switched
to quarterly pricing from a 40-year old system of annual
contracts. Steel Authority imports about 70 percent of its
coking-coal requirement from the global suppliers.  The decline in profit “is due to coal prices,” Chairman
C.S. Verma told reporters in New Delhi today. “Coking coal
prices in the second quarter moved up quite a lot. With the
Commonwealth Games over and the monsoons behind us, I expect a
pickup in construction activity.”  Shares  of Steel Authority fell 5 percent to 202.6 at the
3:30 p.m. close of trade in Mumbai. The  stock  has fallen 16
percent this year, compared with a 14 percent gain in the key
Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange.  Raw material costs rose 20 percent to 48.8 billion rupees,
while total expenses rose 19 percent to 94.8 billion rupees, the
company said in the statement.  India’s steel consumption is likely to grow by as much as
11 percent in the coming three years to more than 75 million
metric tons, Steel Secretary P.K. Misra said in an interview
today. Steel consumption grew 9.9 percent in the April to
September period, Verma said.  Steel Authority expects a venture with South Korea’s Posco
for a 2 million metric ton mill in the eastern state of
Jharkhand to be firmed up by the middle of December, Verma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
