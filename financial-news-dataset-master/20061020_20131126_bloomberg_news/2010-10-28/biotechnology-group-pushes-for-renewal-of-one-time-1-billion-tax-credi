The trade group representing U.S.
biotechnology companies is pressing Congress to repeat a one-
time $1 billion  program  that provides tax credits to small
companies that are developing new drugs.  Under the Therapeutic Discovery Project passed in March as
part of the U.S. health-care overhaul, $5 million in grants or
tax credits will be awarded to drug companies with 250 or fewer
employees to support work developing new therapies. Recipients
in the current program are to be notified by the Internal
Revenue Service.  Extending the program will provide an incentive for
companies to keep operations and jobs in the U.S. instead of
moving overseas, according to a survey of biotech executives
commissioned by the  Biotechnology Industry Organization . The
results were released today at a press briefing organized by BIO
to push for the program’s renewal.  “America is the world leader in biotech and we hope
Congress will consider extending and expanding the program to
support American innovation and speed the development of life-
saving cures,” said  Jim Greenwood , the trade group’s president
and chief executive officer, in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
