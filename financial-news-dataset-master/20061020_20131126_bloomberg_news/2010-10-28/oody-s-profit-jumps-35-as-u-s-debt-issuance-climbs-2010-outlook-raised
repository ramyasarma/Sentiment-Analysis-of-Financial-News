Moody’s Corp. , the bond-rating firm,
said third-quarter earnings rose 35 percent as U.S. corporate
debt sales jumped during that period. The company boosted its
2010 profit forecast.  Net income increased to $136 million, or 58 cents a share,
from $100.6 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier, New York-based
Moody’s said today in a statement distributed by Business Wire.
Excluding some items, the company earned 51 cents a share. The
average forecast of six analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for
45 cents.  Sales of corporate debt in the U.S. rose 33 percent to
$355.1 billion in the third quarter from the same period a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Moody’s said
today it expects to earn $1.90 to $1.96 a share this year,
compared with its previous forecast of $1.75 to $1.85.  “Low interest rates and healthy investor appetite for debt
securities are driving the impressive near-term activity in the
debt issuance market,” analysts led by  Peter Appert  of Piper
Jaffray & Co., said in an Oct. 11 note to clients. “Strength in
both the investment grade and high yield markets drove this
performance.”  Moody’s, whose founder John Moody created credit ratings in
1909, said revenue increased 14 percent to $513.3 million from
$451.8 million a year earlier.  New Regulations  The firm faces higher regulatory and compliance costs that
it plans to offset by charging about 5 percent more to rate
debt, Appert said in a September report after meeting with Chief
Executive Officer  Raymond McDaniel  and Chief Financial Officer
 Linda Huber . Ratings companies are reacting to new legislation
passed after they assigned top marks to U.S. subprime-mortgage
bonds just before that market collapsed in 2007.  The U.S. financial-regulation overhaul, signed into law by
President Barack Obama July 21, mandates that U.S. agencies
remove references to credit ratings in their rules and replace
them with standards developed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for
example.  The new regulations also eliminate credit-rating companies’
shield from lawsuits when underwriters include their assessments
in documents used to sell debt.  Moody’s  rose  23 cents yesterday to $27.13 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares are up 1.2 percent this
year.  (Moody’s will hold a conference call for analysts and
