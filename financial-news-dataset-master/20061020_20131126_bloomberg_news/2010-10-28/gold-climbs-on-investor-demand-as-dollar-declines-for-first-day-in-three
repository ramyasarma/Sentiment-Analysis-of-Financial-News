Gold gained for the first time in
three days in New York as a sliding dollar spurred demand for
the metal as an alternative asset.  The  dollar  fell as much as 1.3 percent against a basket of
six currencies on speculation that any Federal Reserve program
to buy back government assets will debase the U.S. currency.
Gold has climbed 7.6 percent since Sept. 1, reaching a record
$1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14, while the greenback has dropped
6.4 percent.  “How much the Fed eases will matter to the dollar,” said
 Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago. “The
dollar’s important to metals, and it’s the currency value of the
gold that’s driving this market.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $19.90, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $1,342.50 an ounce at 1:59 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. The metal fell 1.2 percent in the previous
two sessions.  Estimates for the size of the asset-purchase program range
from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch to $2 trillion
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Economists at both firms agree the
Fed will likely start by announcing a $500 billion plan after
policy makers meet on Nov. 2.  Gold has gained 2.5 percent in October and 22 percent in
2010, heading for the 10th straight annual gain.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 47.1 cents, or 2
percent, to $23.875 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has gained
9.4 percent in October and 42 percent in 2010.  Investor Lawsuit  HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were accused in
an investor’s lawsuit of placing “spoof” trading orders to
manipulate silver futures and options prices in violation of
U.S. antitrust law.  Joseph Evangelisti , a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, and  Juanita Gutierrez , a spokeswoman for London-based
HSBC, declined to comment.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission began probing
allegations of price manipulation in the silver futures market
in September 2008. At a hearing in Washington on Oct. 26, CFTC
Commissioner  Bart Chilton  said there have been “fraudulent
efforts to persuade and deviously control” prices and that
violators should be prosecuted.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $13.90, or 0.8
percent, to $1,692 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
and were up 2 percent this month. The price has gained 15
percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery added $10.30, or
1.7 percent, to $629.45 an ounce. The price is up 10 percent in
October, heading for the fourth straight monthly gain. Palladium
has risen 54 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
