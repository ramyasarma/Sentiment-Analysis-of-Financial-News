Russia will raise its duty on
standard crude exports by 9 percent and on oil from a privileged
group of fields by 20 percent on Nov. 1 after Urals  prices 
climbed.  The standard tax rate will rise to $290.60 a metric ton
($39.65 a barrel) from $266.50 a ton in October, according to an
 order  signed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and published in
today in the state newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. The discounted
rate on fields supplying the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline
will jump to $98.80 a ton from $82.10 a ton.  Russia sets the duty based on the average Urals price from
the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the next. Urals,
Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $80.09 a barrel in the
period,  Alexander Sakovich , an adviser at the Finance Ministry,
said on Oct. 15.  The export tax on light oil products will be increased to
$208.10 a ton from $191.80. The duty on heavy products will rise
to $112.10 from $103.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
