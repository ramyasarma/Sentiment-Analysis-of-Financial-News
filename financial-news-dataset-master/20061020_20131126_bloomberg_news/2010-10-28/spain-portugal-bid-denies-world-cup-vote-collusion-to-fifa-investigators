Spain and Portugal’s joint bid to
host the 2018 World Cup denied making an improper deal to trade
votes with Qatar, which is attempting to host the 2022 event.  Soccer ruling body FIFA, which prohibits agreements between
bidders, opened an inquiry last week. A spokeswoman for the
Iberian bid in Madrid said it denied wrongdoing in a written
response to FIFA. The news was first reported by sports
newspaper Marca today.  The Iberian bid is vying with England, Russia and a
Netherlands/Belgium effort to be 2018 host, while Qatar is among
bidders for the 2022 event. Voting on who will host the
tournaments is scheduled for Dec. 2.  FIFA executives are scheduled to meet in Zurich today.
While the inquiry isn’t on the agenda, Spain’s FIFA Vice-
President  Angel Maria Villar  may discuss it with fellow
executives, the bid spokeswoman said by telephone. She declined
to be identified.  Qatar bid officials didn’t return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
