Citigroup Inc. ’s Australian unit
offered to buy back A$1.3 billion ($1.27 billion) of government-
guaranteed bonds due in June 2012.  The offer for the fixed- and floating-rate notes will be
priced on or before Nov. 5 after a reverse auction, where
bondholders offer prices at which they’re willing to sell,
according to an e-mailed statement from the lender today.  Citigroup sold the notes in June 2009 under an Australian
government guarantee, introduced to help the nation’s banks fund
themselves when credit markets froze in the wake of the 2008
global financial crisis. It joins Investec Bank (Australia) Ltd.
this month in offering to redeem bonds sold through the  program .  Investec bought back A$195 million of bonds on Oct. 25, in
a transaction priced at 25 basis points more than the bank bill
swap rate, according to a statement at the time. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Citigroup Pty Ltd., the entity that sold the notes being
bought back, is rated A+ by Standard & Poor’s. The bonds carry
an AAA rating because of the government guarantee.  The program was closed to new issuance on March 31 after
Australia’s Treasurer Wayne Swan  said  banks no longer needed the
backing to attract wholesale funding. Lenders with single A
credit ratings paid annual interest of 1 percent to the
government for the guarantee.  Citigroup’s release didn’t elaborate on the reasons for the
buyback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
