Phil Vickery , who captained England
to the 2007 Rugby World Cup final, has been forced to retire
because of injuries.  Vickery, 34, sustained a neck injury while playing for
 London Wasps  this season. After speaking with club doctors, as
well as neurosurgeon Richard Nelson, he was advised to end his
playing career.  “Anyone that knows me will know that I can be a bit
headstrong,” Vickery said in a  statement . “I’m not afraid of
fighting back or proving people wrong, but there comes a stage
when you have to listen and trust in the experts and it is based
on medical reasons that I have been forced to retire.”  The prop forward played 73 times for England, leading the
national team out 15 times.  He helped England win the 2003 World Cup and was captain
four years later when it lost to South Africa in the final.
Vickery was also part of two British and Irish Lions tours.  “Phil has been a superb ambassador to the game of rugby
union at every level,” John Steele, Rugby Football Union chief
executive officer, said in a statement. “Phil has always given
everything to England and to every club he has played for.”  Vickery spent 11 years at Gloucester before joining Wasps
in 2006, and helped the London club to titles in the Premiership
and Heineken Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
