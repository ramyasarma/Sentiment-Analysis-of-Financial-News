The government of Croatian Prime
Minister  Jadranka Kosor  survived a no-confidence vote in
Parliament when a motion supported by the opposition failed to
muster enough support.  “The motion for no-confidence was rejected,” Parliament
Speaker Luka Bebic said earlier today after a 15-hour debate.
One lawmaker in the 153-seat parliament abstained in the 79-62
vote. At least 77 votes were needed to support the no-confidence
motion.  Led by the  Social-Democrats , the opposition last week filed
a no-confidence motion against Kosor and her ruling  Croatian
Democratic Union , saying the government is damaged by corruption
scandals and has failed to lead the country out of recession.  As Croatia enters the last round of negotiations for the
planned 2012 entry to the European Union, at least 20 top ruling
party members have been investigated or charged with abuse of
authority and other corruption-related crimes in the last three
months.  The Balkan’s country economy is expected to contract 1.5
percent this year, the second year in a row.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
