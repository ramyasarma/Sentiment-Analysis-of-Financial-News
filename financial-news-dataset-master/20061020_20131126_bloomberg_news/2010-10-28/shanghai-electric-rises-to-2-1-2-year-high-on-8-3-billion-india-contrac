Shanghai Electric Group Co.  rose to
the highest in more than 2 1/2 years in Hong Kong trading after
the Chinese power-equipment maker said it will sign an $8.3
billion contract to supply generators to Indian billionaire Anil
Ambani’s group.  Shares rose as much as 7.4 percent to HK$5.06, the highest
since March 12, 2008, and were traded at HK$5 at 10:50 a.m.
local time. The stock has surged about 40 percent this year
compared with the 6 percent advance in the Hang Seng Index.  The contract to be signed with Reliance Anil Dhirubhai
Ambani Group today is for 36 coal-fired generators and spare
parts, Shanghai Electric said in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange yesterday. The equipment will be supplied over a
decade and will bring as much as $600 million in sales each
year, according to the statement.  “This a huge boost for the company,” said  Dave Dai , an
analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “This
is a long-term contract which will give steady income over the
next ten years.”  About 84 percent of Shanghai Electric’s  revenue  came from
China last year and just over 16 percent from overseas. The
company reported yesterday a 33 percent increase in third-
quarter  profit  from a year earlier.  “Shanghai Electric wants to look abroad as the market for
coal-fired generators in China will fall in the coming years as
the government tackles pollution,” Dai said.  The deal with the Reliance group will help improve Shanghai
Electric’s market share in the Indian power-equipment market,
according to yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
