The opening game of Major League
Baseball’s World Series attracted 15 million viewers to the Fox
network and was the most-watched show last night, the
broadcaster said.  The game, in which the San Francisco Giants beat the Texas
Rangers 11-7, produced an 8.9 rating, the network said today in
an e-mailed statement. Each rating point equals 1 percent of the
115.9 million U.S. TV homes, as tracked by Nielsen Co.  The rating was down 25 percent from a year earlier, when
the New York Yankees vied with the Philadelphia Phillies, Fox
said. New York is the largest television market and Philadelphia
is fourth. San Francisco and Dallas rank fifth and sixth,
according to Nielsen. The audience was up 3 percent from 2008.  Some New York-area viewers were unable to see the telecast
because of a retransmission dispute between News Corp.’s Fox
network and  Cablevision Systems Corp.   News Corp., the New York-based owner of the Wall Street
Journal, rose 17 cents to $14.49 in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading .
The Class A shares have gained 5.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on for this story:
