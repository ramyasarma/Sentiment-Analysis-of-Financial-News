Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said newspaper accounts of sexual escapades with
multiple women at his Milan villa, which a witness said the
premier called “Bunga Bunga” nights, were “media trash.”  Newspapers, including  la Repubblica  and  Il Fatto
Quotidiano , have carried stories in the last two days based on
an account by a Moroccan girl who said she visited Berlusconi’s
villa three times when she was 17.  Il Fatto Quotidiano’s story about alleged visits by a 17-
year-old Moroccan called Ruby to the prime minister’s villa
“are baseless,” Berlusconi’s lawyers  Niccolo Ghedini  and Piero
Longo said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Berlusconi replied to a question about the reports during a
news conference today about the garbage crisis in Naples.  “I have a big heart and I try to help people in need,”
Berlusconi said, according to comments broadcast live by  Sky
TG24 . “But I’m here to talk about real trash, and I’ll leave
the media trash to all of you.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
