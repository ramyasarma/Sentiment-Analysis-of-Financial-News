CME Group Inc. , the world’s largest
futures market, said third-quarter earnings rose 21 percent, led
by gains in interest-rate and currency contracts.  Net income climbed to $244.3 million, or $3.66 a share,
from $202.3 million, or $3.04, a year earlier, Chicago-based CME
said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire. The
company was estimated to earn $3.65, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 23 analysts.  Volume trends were strong and improving in the quarter,
especially during September when commodities contracts rose 56
percent, currencies gained 26 percent and interest rates climbed
17 percent compared with year-ago totals, Credit Suisse Group AG
analyst  Howard Chen  wrote in a note to clients earlier this
month.  “We see meaningful upside and long-term value in the CME
Group franchise given its diverse product set, best-in-class
distribution/clearing platforms and strong free cash flow
generation prospects,” Chen wrote in the Oct. 4 note. He
estimated the company would earn $248.5 million, or $3.70 a
share.  Futures trading is still recovering from the drop in
activity after the credit crisis cut the amount of borrowed
money used to trade while short-term  interest rates  near zero
percent limited investors’ needs to hedge with CME Group’s
largest product class.  CME’s average daily volume in the quarter rose 14 percent
to 11.6 million contracts. That’s still down from the 12.2
million average in the third quarter of 2007, before the company
bought the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Revenue, Expenses  Revenue rose 13 percent to $733.4 million last quarter from
$650.4 million. CME Group controls 98 percent of U.S. futures
trading.  Expenses at the exchange rose 16 percent to $290.5 million
from $249 million a year ago.  CME Group  shares  have lost 16 percent this year through
yesterday after tumbling from a high of $710.75 in December 2007
to a low of $156.55 in November 2008.  CME Group  rose $1.92 to $282.45 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading.  (CME Group will hold a conference call for analysts and
