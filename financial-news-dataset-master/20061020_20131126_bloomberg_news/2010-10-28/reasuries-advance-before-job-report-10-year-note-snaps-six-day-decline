Treasuries rose, with 10-year notes
snapping their longest slide in two years, before a Labor
Department report that economists said will show the pace of
firings isn’t letting up.  Two-year yields were within eight basis points of a record
low as the Fed prepared to buy securities maturing from April
2012 to March 2013 today as part of its  plan  to keep borrowing
costs down. The Treasury is scheduled to sell $29 billion of
seven-year debt today, the last of four note auctions this week.  “The market’s going to rally again,” said  Tomohisa Fujiki ,
an interest-rate strategist in Tokyo at BNP Paribas SA, one of
the 18 primary dealers required to bid at Treasury debt sales.
“The recovery will be slow.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note fell two basis
points to 2.70 percent as of 11:21 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent security due in August
2020 gained 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 11/32.  The notes dropped for the previous six days, pushing yields
up about a quarter percentage point during the period.  Initial claims rose to 455,000 last week from 452,000,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before the Labor Department
report. Claims have been above the 10-year average of 394,500
for all of 2009 and 2010 even as manufacturing and housing show
signs of growth.  ‘Disappointed’  Treasury  10-year notes dropped yesterday as stronger-than-
forecast figures on durable goods orders and new-home sales
added to speculation any Fed program to boost economic growth
will be gradual.  “The marketplace is disappointed at the fact that it’s
more than likely not going to be a huge initial undertaking and
no one knows the amount,” said  John Spinello , chief technical
strategist in New York at Jefferies Group Inc., also a primary
dealer.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said a
renewal of asset purchases will likely signify the end of a 30-
year  bull market  in bonds.  Gross, manager of the world’s largest bond fund, wrote that
the Fed “check-writing in the trillions is not a bondholder’s
friend.” Writing in his monthly investment outlook on Newport
Beach, California-based Pimco’s website, Gross said, “it raises
bond prices to create the illusion of high annual returns, but
ultimately it reaches a dead end where those prices can no
longer go up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
