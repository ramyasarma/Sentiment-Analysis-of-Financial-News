Workers at Anglo American Plc and
Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi copper mine in Chile rejected a company
wage offer in a vote today, the union said.  Workers voted 1,415 against the proposal out of a total of
1,422 votes cast, the union said from the city of Iquique in
northern Chile.  Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi , as the operating company is
known, will request mediated talks at Chile’s Work Inspectorate,
a measure that would delay a strike at the world’s fourth-
biggest copper mine by five working days, spokeswoman Bernardita
Fernandez said. Union leaders may accept the offer to resume
talks if the company approaches them tomorrow, said Juan
Barraza, the union’s secretary.  “This is going to be tough,” he said in an interview.
“We haven’t even started yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
