Richard Fuld, Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s former chief executive officer, will get $10
million from the defunct firm’s insurers to settle a lawsuit by
the Booth Foundation Inc., according to a court filing.  The foundation accused Fuld of “failure to supervise
claims arising out of alleged activities of certain Lehman
brokers” who sold Lehman-issued notes to the foundation, Lehman
said in yesterday’s filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. The payment needs a judge’s permission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
