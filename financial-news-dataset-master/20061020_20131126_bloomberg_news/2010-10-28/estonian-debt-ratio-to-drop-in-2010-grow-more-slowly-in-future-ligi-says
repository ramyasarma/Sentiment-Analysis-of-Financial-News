Estonia’s debt will decline as a
percentage of gross domestic product this year and grow at a
slower pace than previously forecast in coming years, Finance
Minister  Jurgen Ligi  said.  Debt will decline to 7.1 percent of GDP this year from 7.2
percent in 2009, and the debt-to-GDP ratio will “about double”
by 2015, Ligi told reporters today in Tallinn. The Finance
Ministry in August forecast that the ratio would increase to 8
percent this year and 18.7 percent in 2014.  “We can say now that our borrowing schedule is totally
different from what we had forecast,” he said. “We are already
borrowing 1.5 billion krooni ($130 million) less from the
European Investment Bank than we forecast, we know that Latvia
has given up a plan to borrow from us, and we have reserves.”  Estonia, which is due to adopt the euro Jan. 1, has the
lowest level of government debt in the 27-member European Union.
The former Soviet republic’s most important lesson from its
 deepest recession  since independence in 1991 was the need to
accumulate government reserves in good times, Prime Minister
 Andrus Ansip  said last month.  Ansip pledged that government debt would remain the EU’s
lowest “for years.” Estonia’s debt ratio is less than half
that in second-place Luxembourg, where it stands at 14.5
percent, according to EU figures.  Estonia’s government may need to borrow 7 billion krooni
for investments in state-owned utility AS Eesti Energia “which
would be totally different thing than borrowing to finance
current spending,” Ligi said.  State reserves of 19.2 billion krooni exceed debts by 3.35
billion krooni, he said.  Estonia last year agreed to borrow 4.2 billion krooni from
the EIB to finance investments and help cover its budget
deficit. The Cabinet in July approved a loan option for Latvia
of as much as 100 million euros ($122.9 million) as part of an
international bailout for Estonia’s neighbor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
