The establishment of a debt-crisis
management mechanism for euro-region states is an “achievable
feat” in legal terms and should be pursued, Luxembourg Foreign
Minister  Jean Asselborn   said  in an opinion piece in Germany’s
Handelsblatt newspaper.  The European Parliament, national parliaments and the
citizens of Europe should have a say in amending European Union
rules to that effect, Asselborn said. The EU needs a mechanism
to replace the taxpayer-funded 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion)
financial backstop for debt-hit governments that expires in
2013, he said.  Asselborn said “far-reaching” EU treaty changes without a
prior broad discussion across the EU would alienate the citizens
of Europe and risk defeat in parliamentary ratifications in the
27-nation bloc.  Asselborn said he rejects a proposal to suspend voting
rights for countries that violate the EU’s deficit and debt
rules because such a punishment should be reserved for the
infringement by governments of basic rules such as democracy,
human rights and the rule of law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
