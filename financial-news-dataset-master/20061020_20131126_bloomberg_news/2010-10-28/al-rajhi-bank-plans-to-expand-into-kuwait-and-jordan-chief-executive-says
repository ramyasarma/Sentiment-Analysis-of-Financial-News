Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi Arabia’s
biggest publicly traded lender, plans to expand into Kuwait and
Jordan, Chief Executive Officer  Abdullah Al Rajhi  said.  The bank will open a branch in Kuwait before the end of
this year, Al Rajhi told reporters at the World Economic Forum
in Marrakesh, Morocco, today.  The bank has plans “for more than one branch in Jordan,”
Al Rajhi said, without elaborating. He also said the lender has
no current plans to expand into other countries in the region.
The bank has 20 branches in Malaysia.  Al Rajhi said on Oct. 12 that its net income in the third
quarter fell to 1.64 billion ($440 million) Saudi riyals
compared with 1.8 billion riyals in the same period a year
earlier.  The chief executive said that he expects banks in the oil-
rich kingdom to increase lending in 2011. He declined to
elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
