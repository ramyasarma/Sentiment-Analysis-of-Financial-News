India’s stocks fell for the third
day, sending the benchmark index to its lowest level in a week,
led by DLF Ltd.  DLF , the nation’s biggest developer, dropped for a second
day amid concern the central bank will next week raise borrowing
costs for a sixth time this year to curb price increases.
 Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. , a builder of dams, roads and
bridges, fell to a one-month low.  “We don’t rule out further rate increases by the central
bank,” said  Tejas Doshi , vice president of equity research at
Sushil Financial Services Pvt. in Mumbai. “The Reserve Bank
will have to be alert so that demand-led inflation doesn’t lead
to an asset price bubble.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
fell 64.33, or 0.3 percent, to 19,941.04 as of 3:30 p.m. close
in Mumbai. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock
Exchange lost 0.4 percent to 5,987.70. The  BSE 200 Index 
retreated 0.5 percent to 2,538.77.  DLF  declined 2.4 percent to 354.8 rupees, its lowest level
since Sept. 23.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. , the biggest
power-equipment maker, decreased 1.5 percent to 2,447.55 rupees.
Jaiprakash declined 2.5 percent to 121.8 rupees, its lowest
level since Sept. 30.  Cost of Funds  Indian companies are paying the highest short-term
borrowing costs in 19 months as the central bank raises interest
rates to contain inflation and investors drain cash for initial
public offerings, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The cost for three-month  funds  almost doubled to 8.25
percent this year as policy makers boosted benchmark interest
rates five times to curb  price increases  that have averaged 9.7
percent.  India is experiencing a “structural” food price shock,
Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said this
week. The wholesale food inflation rate was 13.75 percent in the
week ended Oct. 16, the commerce ministry said today. It has
remained above 10 percent since June 2009, according to data
from the farm ministry.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. , the largest mobile-phone operator,
increased 2.7 percent to 330.65 rupees after the Economic Times
newspaper reported the largest mobile-phone operator and Aircel
Cellular Ltd. may buy the planned Indian wireless broadband
business of Qualcomm Inc.  Senjam Raj Sekhar , a spokesman for
Bharti Airtel, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the Economic Times’ report, which cited unidentified
industry officials.  Thermax Profit  “Non-voice led growth in the telecom sector will be a game
changer and any telecom company just being a voice player will
be laggard,” Doshi said.  Thermax Ltd. , a power equipment maker, surged 6.6 percent
to 852.45 rupees, its highest level since December 2007, after
its second-quarter profit climbed 65 percent to 895 million
rupees ($20.1 million).  Global funds have been net buyers of stocks for 40 trading
days, matching the longest run of inflows in the more than five
years since Aug. 9, 2005, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  6.99 billion rupees   of
Indian equities on Oct. 26, extending this year’s record
inflows, according to data on the  website  of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
