Eisai Co. , the maker of the Pariet
stomach ulcer treatment, predicted full-year profit will rise
the most in a decade because of stronger demand for the drug in
Japan and lower sales and administrative costs.  Net income will jump 74 percent to 70 billion yen ($858
million) in the year ending March 31, Eisai  said  in a statement
today. The Tokyo-based company raised its forecast by 7.7
percent, surpassing analysts’ estimates, as it reported a 29
percent increase in first-half profit.  “Steady growth” in Japan will drive sales of Pariet,
Eisai’s second-largest product by revenue, to 136 billion yen
this year, 1.5 percent more than earlier projected, it said. The
company cut its full-year sales forecast by 1 percent to 795
billion yen because of the stronger yen, the best performer the
past 12 months among 10 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Net income was 39.9 billion yen, or 140.2 yen a share, in
the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with 30.9 million yen,
or 108.5 yen a share, a year earlier. First-half profit beat the
35.2 billion yen average of three  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Half-year  sales  climbed 4.4 percent to 412.3 billion
yen, spurred by demand for Eisai’s biggest product Aricept, the
world’s best-selling drug for Alzheimer’s disease.  Eisai  gained 0.8 percent, the most in two weeks, to 2,786
yen at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo trading. The benchmark Topix
Index fell 0.4 percent. The stock has fallen 19 percent this
year, the worst performer among Japan’s top four pharmaceutical
companies.  Analysts Estimates  The company, which forecast full-year profit of 65 billion
yen in July, was expected to earn 62.8 billion yen in the
current fiscal year, according to the average of 18  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Annual profit more than doubled in the
year ended March 2001, Bloomberg data show.  The drugmaker raised its projection for operating profit,
or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative
expenses, by 10 percent to 116 billion yen.  First-half Aricept sales increased 10 percent to 172.1
billion yen from a year earlier, accounting for 42 percent of
the company’s total. Revenue from Pariet, sold as Aciphex in the
U.S., slipped 4 percent to 70.3 billion yen.  The U.S. currency averaged 85.77 yen in the three months
ended Sept. 30 and the euro 110.89 yen, compared with 93.58 yen
and 133.81 yen a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Eisai is the first among the country’s biggest drugmakers
to report earnings.  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.  and Daiichi Sankyo
Co. are scheduled to report tomorrow, and Astellas Pharma Inc.
