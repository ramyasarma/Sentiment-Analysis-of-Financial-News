The People’s Bank of China sold
three-year bills at a yield of 2.85 percent in open-market
operations, rising for the first time this year, according to
traders at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and Bank
of China Ltd.  The yield climbed 20 basis points from 2.65 percent in the
last sale two weeks ago. The central bank last week raised the
benchmark lending and deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage
point to help curb inflation.  The rate has dropped at five sales previously on banks
demand since the monetary authority resumed bi-weekly offerings
of the bills in April to help drain cash from the financial
system.  The monetary authority offered 6 billion yuan ($898
million) of the securities at the auction today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
