Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  comments on  BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s $40 billion hostile
takeover offer for  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  He spoke in
Parliament today, in response to questions from the opposition
New Democratic Party.  “The NDP never saw a foreign investment that it liked, just
like the Liberal Party has never seen one that is has turned
down.  “The truth of the matter is that this government, according
to the act, evaluates all investments on their merit. The
Minister of Industry will be announcing a decision on this in
the not-too-distant future.  “Let me assure the House that when we announce this
decision, the criteria will be clear and the decision will be
taken in the best long-run interest of the Canadian economy.  “The government is obliged to listen to all of the
perspectives on this particular transaction before taking a
decision. That is what the government will do without bias, Mr.
Speaker, but also without the kind of ideology of the NDP that
would oppose any foreign investment under any circumstances.”  “That isn’t in the best long-term interests of the Canadian
economy. We will evaluate these bids fairly and on their
merits.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
