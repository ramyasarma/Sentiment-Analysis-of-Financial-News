AZ Electronic Materials, the
chemical maker controlled by private-equity firms Carlyle Group
and Vestar Capital Partners, has drawn orders for all shares in
its $700 million London initial public offering at the narrowed
price range, said two people familiar with the transaction.  Banks managing the IPO are selling shares for 240 pence to
250 pence apiece, and will stop taking orders at 4 p.m. in
London today, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is private. The AZ shares had
previously been offered for 200 pence to 280 pence each.  The company yesterday increased the size of its IPO by 40
percent to $700 million, according to terms of the sale obtained
by Bloomberg News. AZ is raising $400 million while its existing
shareholders plan to sell $300 million of shares, including the
over-allotment option, terms show.  Carlyle and Vestar are each selling $137 million and AZ’s
management plans to sell a further $26 million, the terms show.
The two private-equity firms will each retain a stake of about
21.4 percent in the company, according to the terms.  Carlyle paid about 518 million Swiss francs ($525.6
million) to buy AZ from specialty chemical maker Clariant AG in
2004. Vestar purchased a stake in the company from Washington-
based Carlyle in 2007.  AZ is scheduled to start conditional trading tomorrow.
Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are
managing the IPO.  Over-allotment options allow underwriters to purchase
additional shares at the original IPO price after the stock
starts trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
