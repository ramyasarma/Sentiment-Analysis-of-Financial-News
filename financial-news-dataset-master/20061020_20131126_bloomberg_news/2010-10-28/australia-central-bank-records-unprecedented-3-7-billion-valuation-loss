The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  had a
record loss of A$4.9 billion ($4.9 billion) in the 12 months
through June as a rising local currency eroded the value of its
foreign-exchange holdings.  Underlying earnings were A$897 million, realized valuation
losses totaled A$1.1 billion and unrealized valuation losses
amounted to A$4.7 billion, the central bank said in its 2011
 annual report  today. The latter was tied to a 16 percent gain in
an index of the basket of currencies in which Australia’s
foreign reserves are invested.  “A rising currency, though reflecting improved prospects
for the Australian economy, reduces the Australian dollar value
of the Reserve Bank’s foreign assets,” Governor  Glenn Stevens 
said in the report.  It was the second straight fiscal year without a profit at
the RBA or a dividend paid to the government, following a loss
of A$2.9 billion a year earlier. The last time the RBA had
consecutive losses was in the 1970s.  Most of the latest loss was absorbed by transfering money
from a general  reserve fund  that totaled A$1.3 billion as of
June 30, down from A$6.2 billion a year earlier, the RBA said.  Stevens’s total compensation rose 3.2 percent to A$1.08
million this year, the central bank said. His 2011 pay package
included a salary of A$834,186, it said, a 3.7 percent rise from
his 2010 salary. His pay increase was in line with the nation’s
annual inflation rate.  Stevens’s Pay  The RBA, which pays its governor more than Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  combined, will for the first time lose its
sole power to set compensation for its board and executives,
Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said last week.  Swan wasn’t told until almost a year after the central bank
chief got a A$234,000 pay raise in October 2008.  In addition to foreign currency assets, the RBA holds 80
metric tons of gold on its balance sheet. Over 2010-11, the
price of gold rose by 21 percent in U.S. dollar terms and
declined by 4 percent in Australian dollar terms, the central
bank said. As a result, the value of the central bank’s holdings
of gold declined A$148 million to A$3.6 billion at the end of
June, according to the report.  A lack of activity in the gold lending market continued in
the latest fiscal year, the RBA said. At the end of June, there
was 1 ton of gold on loan, it said.  Rate Policy  Australia’s central bank lowered  interest rates  to a half-
century low of 3 percent to help cushion the economy from the
impact of the 2009 global recession. It then boosted borrowing
costs in seven quarter-percentage-point steps from October 2009
to November last year to 4.75 percent, the highest in the
developed world.  “After a period in which monetary policy changes had been
frequent and sometimes quite large, as the board responded to
the financial crisis and then normalized settings afterward,
there was only one change to the cash rate in 2010-11, the most
stable outcome for five years,” Stevens said in his statement
accompanying the report.  “The Australian economy ended the financial year with an
unemployment rate of around 5 percent, inflation in underlying
terms close to target, and a strong and stable financial
system,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
