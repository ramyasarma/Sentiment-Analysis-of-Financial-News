Chicago, the third most-populous
U.S. city, had its credit ranking on $6.8 billion in general-
obligation bonds cut one level to AA- by Fitch Ratings.  It was the second time in less than three months that Fitch
has lowered the city’s debt grade as it uses reserves and one-
time revenue measures to balance its budget. Fitch now ranks
Chicago at its fourth-highest investment grade.  “While the economy remains broad and diverse, the city’s
financial position has weakened as reflected by multiple years
of budget gaps and structural imbalance, as well as a large and
rapidly growing unfunded pension obligation,” Fitch said today
in a report.  The city’s reserve funds, built up with proceeds from
leasing parking meters and an elevated toll road that connects
the city to Indiana, will fall to an estimated $790 million by
year-end from a high of $2 billion, Fitch said. The city is
using reserves to help close its largest-ever budget gap of $655
million for fiscal year 2011.  Fitch also assigned an AA- rating to $795 million of
taxable and tax-exempt debt Chicago expects to sell on Nov. 9.  Prices on Chicago’s taxable general obligation bonds
maturing in 2032 remained about the same following Fitch’s
action. Dealers traded the bonds to each other at 98.25 cents on
the dollar to yield 6.358 percent. Yesterday, dealers traded the
bonds at 98.5 cents to yield 6.336 percent.  Pete Scales, a spokesman for the city’s budget office,
didn’t immediately respond to a telephone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
