The U.S. Treasury will issue a net
$387 billion of securities this quarter, down from net issuance
of $395.8 billion in the third quarter, a survey by the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association showed.  Sales of shorter-term Treasury bills and longer-term
coupons will decline as the Treasury decreases the sizes of
auctions in line with a drop in the financing needs of the
government. The estimates are the median forecasts in a
quarterly poll of  SIFMA  members representing primary dealers,
the New York-based association said in a statement today. The 18
primary dealers trade government  debt  with the Federal Reserve
and are required to participate in Treasury auctions.  The estimate for coupon debt sales of notes and bonds in
October through December is $364 billion, compared with $362.5
billion issued in the fourth quarter a year ago, the group said.  Two-year notes  are forecast to yield 0.4 percent in the
fourth quarter and first quarter of 2011, according to the
survey. The 10-year note is forecast to  yield  2.4 percent in the
fourth and first quarter of next year. The yield curve is
expected to remain flat on concern about the progress of the
U.S. economic recovery, lagging employment and a faltering
housing market.  The Treasury is forecast to issue $19.5 billion of Treasury
inflation-protected securities this quarter, 33 percent below
the $29.3 billion sold last quarter, according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
