Copper rebounded from a two-day drop
as the dollar resumed a decline, and on concern that there may
be supply disruptions at the world’s fourth-largest mine. Zinc
and nickel also rose.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.7 percent to $8,357 a metric ton
and traded at $8,340 a ton at 3:06 p.m. in Singapore. February-
delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as
1 percent to 63,600 yuan ($9,512) a ton and closed at 64,020
yuan. The contract rose as high as 65,600 yuan yesterday, the
highest price since April 2008.  Workers at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi
copper mine in Chile, the world’s largest copper producer,
rejected a company wage offer in a vote yesterday, the union
said. Workers are prepared to continue wage negotiations “if
the company is willing to talk,” the union’s secretary Juan
Antonio Barraza said.  “A strike in Chile is a short-term support for prices that
are trading beyond their fundamentals,” Lu Shihua, an analyst
at New Era Futures Co., said from Jiangsu today. “The dollar
continues to drive day-to-day moves. However, we’re beginning to
see demand destruction at these prices and we’ll get more demand
falling off as we move into the seasonally weak consumption
period.”  The dollar snapped a two-day winning streak against a six-
currency basket including the euro on optimism that the global
economic recovery remains intact. A European report today may
show that confidence in the region’s outlook improved for a
fifth consecutive month.  Aluminum climbed 0.5 percent to $2,334 a ton, zinc climbed
0.6 percent to $2,525 a ton, nickel gained 0.5 percent to
$22,920 a ton and lead fell 0.2 percent to $2,538 a ton. Tin was
little changed at $26,060 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
