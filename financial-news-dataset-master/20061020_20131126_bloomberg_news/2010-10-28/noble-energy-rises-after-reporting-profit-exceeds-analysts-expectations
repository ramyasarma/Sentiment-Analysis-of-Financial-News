Noble Energy  Inc., the oil and
natural-gas producer with prospects from the U.S. Rocky
Mountains to West Africa,  rose as much as  5 percent after
reporting quarterly profit more than doubled, exceeding
analysts’ estimates by 49 cents on higher-than-expected
production.  The company also raised production estimates for the rest
of this year.  Noble Energy , based in Houston, increased $3.19, or 4
percent, to $80.49 at 9:39 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares rose as high as $81.15 earlier.  Net income in the third quarter rose to $232 million, or
$1.31 per share, from $107 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier,
Noble said today in a statement. Profit, excluding a charge
related to an asset impairment and a gain on an asset sale,
would have been $1.27 a share, beating by 49 cents the average
of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Not only did they get more hydrocarbons, but their prices
were a little bit better than I had forecast,” said  Philip Weiss , an analyst at Argus Research in New York, who rates the
shares a “hold” and owns none. “It’s like doubling down.”  The company sold an average of 230,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day, higher than its guidance given July 29 that
sales volumes would be in the range of 212,000 to 220,000
barrels a day.  The average price the company received for its oil and
condensate was $74.41 per barrel, and $2.82 per thousand cubic
feet for natural gas.  Israel Production  The “chief reason” for Noble’s higher production is due
to record volumes in Israel, said  Leo Mariani , an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets in Austin, Texas, who rates the shares
“outperform” and owns none.  “All around, a very solid performance by these guys,”
Mariani said today in a telephone interview. “It was a pretty
hot summer there in Israel and they’ve got a pretty big call on
gas demand when that’s the case for electric power generation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
