AutoNation Inc.  fell the most since
March after the largest U.S. auto retailer said third-quarter
profit fell 12 percent as sales of new import vehicles declined.  Net income  dropped to $56.9 million, or 38 cents a share,
from $65 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, Fort Lauderdale,
Florida-based AutoNation said today in a statement. Excluding
some items, profit was 39 cents a share, trailing the 42-cent
average  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 13 percent to $3.27 billion.  U.S. new-vehicle  sales  may be 11.5 million in 2010,
AutoNation said in the statement, repeating an earlier forecast.
Deliveries in the fourth quarter would have to run at seasonally
adjusted annualized pace of about 12 million units for that
target to be achieved, Chief Executive Officer  Mike Jackson 
said.  “Sales thus far in October would seem to confirm that
we’re on track for that,” Jackson said in a telephone
interview. Industrywide deliveries for October are scheduled to
be released Nov. 3.  AutoNation fell $1.85, or 7.5 percent, to $22.95 at 4:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares
declined the most since March 20, 2009, for the  sixth-biggest 
drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  AutoNation sold 29,858 new import vehicles in the quarter,
a 3 percent decline from a year earlier, and income from the
segment fell 18 percent to $51.3 million. Selling and
administrative expenses climbed 7.3 percent to $402.9 million.  The industrywide annualized selling rate in September was
11.8 million cars and light trucks, the fastest pace since the
federal government’s “cash for clunkers” incentive program
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
