South African Finance Minister
Pravin Gordhan said the country has “tough choices” to make in
the next few weeks as it seeks to balance spending with revenue,
according to an interview with Radio 702.  “There are tough decisions to be made, the are tough
compromises to be made,” Gordhan told the Johannesburg-based
talk radio station. South Africa needs to find a “middle road”
on job creation that makes it easier for companies to hire
workers without “trampling” their rights, he added.  South Africa also hopes “to make more progress” in
forthcoming Group of 20 discussions on currency appreciation,
said Gordhan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
