Commerzbank AG , Germany’s second-
biggest lender, wants to boost market share in the retail
business after adding 50,000 net new clients in the third
quarter, management board member  Achim Kassow  said.  “There’s room for growth,” Kassow, head of the retail
banking unit, said at a financial conference in Frankfurt today.
“We need more customers.”  Commerzbank, which is still integrating Dresdner Bank, has
11 million retail customers and a market share of 7 percent. The
unit, which reported first-half operating profit of 49 million
euros ($68 million), aims to boost earnings to 1 billion euros
by 2012 with a combination of cost cuts, higher revenue and
lower provisions for loan defaults.  Loan-loss provisions will probably peak this year in retail
banking, helped by economic growth and lower unemployment,
Kassow said. Commerzbank sees “first signs” that interest
rates and client activity may rise, he said.  Still, the German retail market faces “stiff competition”
and “margin pressure,” according to Kassow.  Deutsche Bank AG ,
Germany’s biggest bank, plans to take over Deutsche Postbank AG
and Spain’s  Banco Santander SA  agreed to purchase of  SEB AB ’s
German retail business in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
