Namibia  confirmed 29 new cases of
swine flu following an outbreak of the virus in the capital,
Windhoek, and the northern Omusati Region, Health Minister
 Richard Kamwi  said.  The southern African nation isn’t planning a mass
vaccination campaign because the outbreak is not out of control,
Kamwi said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
