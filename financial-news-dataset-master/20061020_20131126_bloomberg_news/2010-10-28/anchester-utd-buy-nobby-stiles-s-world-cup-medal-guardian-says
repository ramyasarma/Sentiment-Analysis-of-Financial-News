English Premier League soccer club
Manchester United acquired former midfielder Nobby Stiles’s 1966
World Cup medal for 188,200 pounds ($296,979) at auction, the
Guardian reported, citing his family.  Stiles, whose gap-toothed smile while capering around
carrying the trophy at Wembley Stadium remains an iconic image
of England’s only World Cup victory, sold his collection of
memorabilia, including his 1968 European Cup winner’s medal and
a collection of shirts and caps, and raised 424,328 pounds to
fund his retirement, the newspaper said.  His old club, which acquired the medals and a shirt he wore
in the 1968 European Cup final against Benfica, will display
them in the Manchester United museum, the Guardian said.  Stiles suffered a minor stroke earlier this year and only
Bobby Charlton, Roger Hunt and Jack Charlton have kept their
medals, the Guardian said.        To contact the editor responsible for this story:
