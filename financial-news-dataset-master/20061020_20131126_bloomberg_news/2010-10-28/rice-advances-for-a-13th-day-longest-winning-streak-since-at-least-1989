Rice rose for a 13th day in Chicago,
the longest winning streak since at least 1989, after the
Philippines said storms caused 523,013 metric tons of crop
losses.  The Philippines, the world’s biggest rice buyer, last year
produced 9.8 million tons of the grain and imported 2.2 million
tons, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Rice has added 17 percent since Oct. 11, the last time futures
fell. The current streak of gains is the longest for data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1989.  Rough rice for January delivery climbed 7.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $15.245 per 100 pounds at 1:13 p.m. London time on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price for the most-
active contract since Jan. 4. The grain has jumped 57 percent
since the end of June as hot weather in the U.S., last year’s
fourth-largest exporter, curbed production.  The Philippine Department of Agriculture announced the crop
loss in a statement. Typhoon Megi, which passed over the island
archipelago’s north last week, “completely damaged” 8,997
hectares (22,232 acres) of rice land and partially damaged about
416,137 hectares, it said.  Philippine growers last year harvested about 4.45 million
hectares of land seeded with rice, according to the USDA.  Floods in Thailand, the world’s biggest exporter of the
grain, have damaged about 2.8 million rai (1.1 million acres) of
land planted with rice, the Office of Agricultural Economics
said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
