Japanese  stock   futures  fell as a
strengthening yen added to concern about earnings growth, while
Australian shares rose after commodity prices increased and
Macquarie Group Ltd. said it will continue expanding.  American depositary receipts of Sharp Corp., Japan’s
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, tumbled 3.9 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo as the yen rose and the
company cut its profit forecast. ADRs of Advantest Corp., the
world’s No. 1 maker of memory-chip testers, lost 2.1 percent as
profit missed forecasts and Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its rating
on the stock. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining
company, advanced 0.8 percent in Sydney, and Macquarie,
Australia’s biggest investment bank, jumped 4.5 percent.  “Exporters overall will likely slide” in Japan, said
 Juichi Wako , a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura. “There
are uncertainties about the outlook for earnings in the second
half.”  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 9,340 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,360 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,350 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index was little changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
climbed 0.5 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. While the index rose 0.1 percent yesterday in New York,
most stocks fell as 3M Co. drove industrial shares lower after
cutting its profit forecast.  Yen Hurts Exporters  The yen appreciated to 80.87 against the dollar around
midnight, compared with 81.63 at the close of stock trading in
Tokyo yesterday and a 15-year high of 80.41 reached on Oct. 25.
A stronger yen reduces overseas income at Japanese companies
when converted into their home currency.  The yen is on course for its strongest annual average level
since currencies began trading freely in 1971, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s closing price.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has increased 7.6 percent in
2010, compared with gains of 6.2 percent by the S&P 500 and 4.7
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.3 times estimated earnings, compared
with 14 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 0.5 percent
yesterday. Crude oil for December delivery climbed 0.3 percent
to $82.18 a barrel in New York yesterday. Copper futures
increased 0.3 percent.  Today is the  peak day  for earnings reports in Japan, with
about 270 of the 1,664 companies in the Topix scheduled to
report results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  About three companies have  exceeded profit estimates  for
every two that fell short, based on data compiled by Bloomberg
from the 322 companies in the Topix that have reported quarterly
results since Oct. 7.  To contact the reporters for this story:
