Kenneth Ira Starr , the former
Manhattan money manager who pleaded guilty in September to
defrauding his clients, was sued by his companies’ receiver for
at least $35 million in damages.  Starr caused losses to the companies he led exceeding $35
million as a result of his breach of fiduciary duties, according
to the complaint filed yesterday in New York state Supreme Court
in Manhattan by  Aurora Cassirer , as receiver for Starr
Investment Advisors LLC and Starr and Company LLC.  Before Starr’s criminal conduct began to damage the
businesses, the Starr companies had more than 200 wealthy
clients, and annual revenue topping $12.5 million, Cassirer
said. She is seeking punitive damages against Starr in the
amount of three times the compensatory damages awarded.  Starr, 66, pleaded guilty on Sept. 10 to three criminal
counts before U.S. Magistrate Judge  Theodore Katz  in Manhattan.
Starr, whose firm’s clients included heiress Rachel “Bunny”
Mellon and actors  Sylvester Stallone  and  Wesley Snipes , told the
court he had stolen as much as $50 million. He hasn’t yet been
sentenced.  The case is Aurora Cassirer v. Kenneth Ira Starr,
651853/2010, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
