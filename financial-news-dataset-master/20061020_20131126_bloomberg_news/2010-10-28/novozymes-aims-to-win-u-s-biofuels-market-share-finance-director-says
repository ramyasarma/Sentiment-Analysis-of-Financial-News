Novozymes A/S, the world’s largest
maker of industrial enzymes, aims to win market share in sales
of enzymes to the U.S. biofuels industry, Chief Financial
Officer Benny Loft said in a telephone interview.  “We’re working to outcompete market growth,” Loft said.
“This is a more long-term expectation that we have, it won’t
happen in the fourth quarter.”  Enzyme sales to the ethanol industry represent about 18
percent of Novozymes total sales, the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based
company said in its third-quarter earnings report today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
