Italy’s UniCredit SpA plans to
expand retail and investment banking in central and eastern
Europe in spite of shareholder pressure to focus on domestic
growth, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an interview
with Chief Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni.  Alessandro Profumo was ousted as chief executive last month
after feuding with investors over eastern Europe and Libya:
Ghizzoni told the Journal that central and eastern Europe “is
one of the top priorities for the business of the group. We want
to increase capital allocation in this area.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
