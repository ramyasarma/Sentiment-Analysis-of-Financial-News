The pound extended its gains against
the dollar, recouping yesterday’s decline amid waning
speculation that the Bank of England will engage in another
round of asset purchases soon to stimulate the economy.  Sterling advanced 0.4 percent to $1.5836 at 10:46 a.m. in
London. It reached $1.5897 two days ago, when government
statistics showed faster-than-expected growth in British gross
domestic product.  “Sterling is still benefiting from the spillover effect
from the stronger than expected GDP, which will cool down
speculation that the BOE will be forced into more quantitative
easing sooner rather than later,” said  Roberto Mialich , senior
currency strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan.  The pound was little changed against the euro at 87.34
pence.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
