Soybean futures were unchanged,
erasing earlier gains on speculation that demand for the oilseed
will slow as China seeks to stabilize food costs.  Soybeans climbed to a 25-month high today in Chicago before
retreating, after the U.S. government said export sales last
week were 40 percent above the previous four-week average. About
68 percent of the sales went to China, where inflation rose to
almost a two-year high in September. The  government there said
yesterday that it will ensure adequate grain production and
crack down on commodity hoarding.  “China has been making some jawboning noises about
controlling speculators and concern about prices for basic food
stuffs rising,” said  Anne Frick , senior analyst for Prudential
Bache Commodities LLC in New York. “As prices keep rallying,
they have to keep buying at higher and higher levels. Even bull
markets tend to have some periodic setbacks.”  Soybean futures for January delivery settled unchanged at
$12.36 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $12.4875, the highest level for a
most-active contract since Sept. 4, 2008. The commodity has
climbed 12 percent this month and 37 percent since the end of
June. The gain this year is 18 percent.  U.S.  exporters  sold 2.026 million metric tons in the week
ended Oct. 21, according to the Department of Agriculture. In a
separate report, the agency said that 305,000 tons were sold to
unknown buyers. The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of
soybeans.  Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $31.8
billion last year, behind corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
