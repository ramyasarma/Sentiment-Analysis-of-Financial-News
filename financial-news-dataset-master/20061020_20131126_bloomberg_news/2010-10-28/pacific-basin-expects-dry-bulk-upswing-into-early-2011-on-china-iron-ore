Pacific Basin Shipping Ltd. , Hong
Kong’s largest operator of dry-bulk vessels, forecast an upswing
in demand from next month through early 2011 as Chinese
steelmakers rebuild stocks of iron ore.  The resumption of Indian trade following monsoons and
increased demand for U.S. grain shipments because of a Russian
export ban will also drive volumes, the shipping line said in a
Hong Kong stock exchange statement today.  The company will continue to look for new vessels after
adding 17 ships through purchases or long-term charters since
December as the dry-bulk market rebounds from last year’s global
recession. Spot rates for handysize ships, the biggest part of
Pacific Basin’s bulk fleet, were 30 percent higher last quarter
than a year earlier, according to the statement.  “The overall dry-bulk market improved sooner than we
expected following a mid-year seasonal slow-down,” the shipping
line said.  Chinese imports of iron ore rose 18 percent in September
from the month before on demand from steelmakers. The  Baltic Dry
Index , a measure of rates for carrying iron ore, coal and other
commodities, has risen 64 percent from this year’s low of 1,700.  Pacific Basin rose 0.2 percent to close at HK$5.55 in Hong
Kong. The stock has fallen 1.4 percent this year compared with a
6.1 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  The company has covered 94 percent of 2010 handysize
revenue days at $16,670 per day and 37 percent of 2011 days at
$14,230, it said. A handysize ship has a capacity of between
25,000 and 34,999 deadweight tons; handymax vessels are
typically between 35,000 and 59,999 deadweight tons.  The shipping line has also covered 99 percent of its 2010
handymax days and 109 percent of its 2011 handymax days, it said.  The company had a fleet of 130 owned or chartered dry-bulk
vessels as of Oct. 28, including 90 handysize ships, it said.
The company’s orderbook comprises nine handysize, four handymax
and two post-panamax ships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
