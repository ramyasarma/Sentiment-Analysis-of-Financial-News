Natural gas futures rose in New York,
reversing earlier losses, on forecasts for below-normal
temperatures that may boost demand for the heating fuel.  Colder-than-normal weather is likely in parts of the
central and western U.S. from Nov. 14 through Nov. 18, Commodity
Weather Group said. The cold may push into the East Coast at the
end of that period, the company said.  “We’re seeing a little bit of support coming in because of
the cold-weather outlook,” said  Matt Smith , an analyst with
Summit Energy in Louisville, Kentucky. “There isn’t a great
deal to encourage much more selling.”  Natural gas for December delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $3.856 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after touching an intraday
low of $3.743. Futures have fallen 4.5 percent in the first four
days of this week.  The high in Chicago on Nov. 13 may be 46 degrees Fahrenheit
(8 Celsius), 3 degrees below normal, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.  Temperatures may average 1 or 2 degrees below normal in
parts of the upper Midwest and northern New England this winter,
Commodity Weather Group forecasters led by  Matt Rogers  said in
an outlook Oct. 25.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Demand for the heating and power-plant fuel, which peaks
during the cold-weather months, drove gas to $6.108 last
January.  Stockpile Report  Gas supplies gained 67 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Oct. 29 to 3.821 trillion, the Energy Department said today.
Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg before the report showed
an expected gain of 64 billion. A survey of Bloomberg users
showed an increase of 63 billion.  Last week’s storage increase was bigger than the five-year
average gain for the week of 26 billion cubic feet, department
data show. A surplus to the five-year average rose to 10.2
percent from 9.1 percent the previous week. Supplies compared
with a year earlier rose to a surplus for the first time since
June.  Stockpiles climbed to a record 3.837 trillion cubic feet
last November before colder weather sparked demand, reducing
supplies.  U.S. natural gas production increased 1.6 percent in August
as output from wells in the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana
increased, the Energy Department  reported  on Oct. 29.  U.S. Output  Output rose to 72.38 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 71.27 billion in July, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said in a monthly report known as
EIA-914.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 17.08 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $3.525 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
275,718 as of 3:01 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
266,000. Volume was 161,614 yesterday. Open interest was 796,753
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 811,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
