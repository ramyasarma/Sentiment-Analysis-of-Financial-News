The euro may decline against the
dollar to last week’s low of about $1.3695 before heading higher
again, according to Societe Generale SA technical analysts.  The euro, which has appreciated 2 percent against the
dollar this month, rose 0.6 percent against the dollar to
$1.3856 at 12:30 p.m. in London. The currency may reach $1.4160
before testing the next so-called resistance level at $1.4570,
the bank wrote, citing Fibonacci analysis.  “The short-term risk remains to the downside despite
today’s upmove,” wrote Societe Generale’s technical analysts
 Hugues Naka  and  Fabien Manac’h  in Paris. Following a decline,
the euro “should then point back to $1.4160/$1.4220, which will
be the key resistance zone to break to confirm the resumption of
the medium-term uptrend.”  The euro rose about 1.3 percent in the past three months
against its major trading peers, Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indices show. It slid 8 percent this year on the same
basis. The common currency will fall to $1.35 by the end of this
year and to $1.34 by the end of March, according to a median
forecast by analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. Key
percentages include 23.6, 38.2, 50 and 61.8. A break above
resistance, where sell orders may be clustered, or below
support, where there may be buy orders, indicates a currency may
move to the next level.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. A support level on a
chart is where technical analysts expect orders to buy a bond
and its related securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
