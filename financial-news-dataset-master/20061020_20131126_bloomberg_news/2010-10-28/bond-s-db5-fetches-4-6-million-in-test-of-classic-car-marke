A James Bond Aston Martin with
machine guns sold for $4.6 million, less than its estimate, as
collectors tested the auction market for classic cars in London.  The DB5’s price of 2.9 million pounds including 12 percent
fees last night compared to a presale low estimate hammer price
of 3.5 million pounds. It had been described as “the most
famous car in the world” by specialist sellers  RM Auctions ,
which ran the sale in association with  Sotheby’s .  “To create a show, RM took in some cars at bullish
estimate levels,” Neil Dickens, director of Wiltshire, U.K.-
based dealership  the Hairpin Co. , said in an interview. “It’s
business as usual. Rich people are still looking for the best
cars in original condition.”  As has been the pattern at car auctions after the financial
crisis, buyers had a clear idea of what vehicles were worth and
balked at lots they judged to be overpriced, said dealers.  The 1964 DB5, driven by  Sean Connery  in the Bond movie
“Goldfinger,” was also used in ‘Thunderball.’’ It had
revolving number plates and an ejector seat. The buyer was
identified by RM as an Ohio-based collector, Harry Yeaggy, who
was hugged by the seller, Philadelphia radio broadcaster  Jerry Lee . Sale proceeds benefit the  Jerry Lee Foundation , a charity
fighting social problems and crime.  The Aston was one of four out of six vehicles expected to
fetch as much as 1 million pounds that sold for hammer prices
below the low estimate.  Speedy Pagani  A 2010  Pagani  Zonda R sports car, capable of a top speed of
233 mph, sold for 806,400 pounds with fees against a minimum
forecast of 1.3 million pounds. The Pagani cost 1.4 million
euros ($1.93 million) new, said auctioneer Max Girardo, RM’s
European-based specialist, as he knocked down the lot.  A 1952 Jaguar C-Type racer failed at the auction against a
low valuation of 1.9 million pounds.  A streamlined 1938 Talbot-Lago T23 “Teardrop” coupe --
one of just five built by the French manufacturer in the
original “Jeancart” design -- was one of the evening’s few
high-value lots to sell for more than estimate. Restored in the
1970s, it sold to a buyer in the room for 1.8 million pounds
with fees against an estimate of 1.1 million pounds to 1.4
million pounds.  A yellow 1972 Lamborghini Miura SV, whose first owner was
the singer  Rod Stewart , reached 694,400 pounds against an upper
forecast of 560,000 pounds.  “There’s a price movement for 1970s cars,” Dickens said.
“The market has shifted a generation. New people are buying the
cars they wanted as a kid. That Lamborghini would have been
worth about half that a couple of years ago.”  ( Scott Reyburn  writes about the art market for Muse, the
