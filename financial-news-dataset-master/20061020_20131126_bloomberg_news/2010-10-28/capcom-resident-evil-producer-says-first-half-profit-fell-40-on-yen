Capcom Co. , maker of the “Resident
Evil” video-game series, said first-half profit fell 40 percent
because of the yen’s surge against other major currencies. The
company maintained its full-year forecast of 6.5 billion yen.  Net income fell to 1.78 billion yen ($22 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30 from 2.97 billion yen a year earlier,
the Osaka-based company said today in a statement. Operating
profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative
expenses, dropped 47 percent to 3.94 billion yen, compared with
the 3.92 billion yen average of six analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  “A one yen change against the dollar has a 150 million yen
effect on our operating profit,” Kenkichi Nomura, head of
Capcom’s finance and accounting division, said at a briefing in
Osaka, where the company is based.  The yen, which has gained 13 percent against the U.S.
dollar since Capcom’s fiscal year started on April 1, traded at
81.33 as of 6:16 p.m. in Tokyo.  Capcom’s sales rose 4.7 percent in the period to 40.7
billion yen, with the company reiterating its target for full-
year revenue of 91 billion yen.  The company may see sales improve starting in December,
when it releases “Monster Hunter Portable 3rd,”  Jay Defibaugh ,
an analyst at MF Global FXA Securities in Tokyo, said before the
earnings were released.  “Capcom has other big titles coming through for the next
fiscal year,” including martial-arts title “Marvel Vs. Capcom
3, he said. “They have a proven track record in establishing
new million-selling franchises.”  The  shares , which have declined 16 percent this year, fell
1.1 percent to close at 1,281 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
before the announcement. The benchmark  Nikkei  225 Stock Average
lost 0.2 percent.  Capcom president  Haruhiro Tsujimoto  said in September the
company was in talks with a “major” Chinese online game
partner to enter the world’s biggest Internet market. Online
gaming in China was worth about 27 billion yuan ($4 billion)
last year, according to Shanghai-based  IResearch .  To contact the reporter on this story:
