Peru’s Congress may pass legislation
to raise the limit on pension funds’ purchases of stocks and
bonds overseas by December, freeing up to $6 billion, a pension
fund manager said.  The Andean country’s private pension funds have invested
abroad 29 percent of the total $30 billion, near the 30 percent
legal limit, said  Gonzalo Camargo , who oversees $6.8 billion at
Lima-based AFP Horizonte. The government will ask lawmakers to
raise the limit to 50 percent, Finance Minister  Ismael Benavides 
said yesterday.  “It’s doable during this legislative session as it’s not
that complicated,” Camargo said in an interview in Lima.
“Pension funds need more investment alternatives.”  Peru’s central bank has increased the operating limit four
times this year to 30 percent from 22 percent last year,
allowing the funds to diversify their investments and reduce
demand for soles. Congress must approve any further increase in
the cap.  An increase to 50 percent will enable local pension funds
to invest more in services, energy and banking stocks in Chile
and Colombia once the three Andean nations integrate their stock
exchanges next month, said Peru’s Banking Superintendent  Felipe Tam Fox .  The integrated market will be Latin America’s top issuer
with a total of 563 stocks, and second in market capitalization
with $564 billion, behind Brazil with $1.28 trillion, Colombia
stock exchange President  Juan Pablo Cordoba  said Oct. 5.  “In the integration it’s considered foreign investment, so
we deny the funds opportunities if we don’t increase the
limit,” Tam told reporters in Lima today.  Tin Futures  Peru’s pension funds are seeking to invest more in stocks
and bonds in Brazil and China, as well as commodities such as
tin, Camargo said.  “We need to be in countries linked to the Chinese cycle
like the Pacific Rim,” Camargo said. “Growth today is coming
from the emerging markets.”  Tin futures have nearly tripled on the London Metal
Exchange since December 2008. The metal rose $200, or 0.8
percent, to $26,250 per ton on the LME today.  Peru’s sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.7955 per dollar at 2:20
p.m. New York time, from 2.8005 yesterday. The sol has increased
3.3 percent this year.  The Lima  General Index  fell 0.1 percent to 18,967.26 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
