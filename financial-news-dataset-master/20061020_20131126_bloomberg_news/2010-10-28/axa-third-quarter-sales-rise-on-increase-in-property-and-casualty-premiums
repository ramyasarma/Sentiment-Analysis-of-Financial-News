Axa SA , Europe’s second-biggest
insurer, had a 4.4 percent increase in third-quarter sales on
higher property and casualty premiums. Outflows at the asset-
management business continued.  Sales in the third quarter rose to about 20.5 billion euros
($28 billion) from 19.7 billion euros a year earlier, based on
figures the Paris-based insurer provided today in a statement.
That beat the 20.3 billion-euro average estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Third-quarter property and casualty sales rose to about
6 billion euros from 5.61 billion euros a year earlier. That
exceeded the average estimate of 5.82 billion euros. Life and
savings revenue advanced to 13.1 billion euros from 12.6 billion
euros last year.  Axa’s asset-management revenue increased to 793 million
euros in the quarter from 750 million euros a year earlier,
based on the insurer’s data. That missed analysts’ estimates for
840 million euros. Asset-management outflows this year reached
41 billion euros at the end of September, compared with 25
billion euros at the end of June.  Axa’s total nine-month sales increased 3.5 percent to 70.5
billion euros, the insurer said today. Bloomberg calculated
third-quarter revenue by subtracting first-half figures from the
nine-month data published by Axa today. The company declined to
confirm the figures.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
