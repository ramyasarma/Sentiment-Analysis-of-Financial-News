Another round of quantitative easing
is mostly priced into currency markets and the U.S. dollar will
weaken through the end of November before recovering, according
to John Taylor, chairman and founder of FX Concepts Inc.   The dollar will likely weaken to $1.40 to $1.43 per euro by
the end of next month before recovering to close the year at
$1.30 to $1.35, Taylor said during a Bloomberg Television
interview with Erik Schatzker. The euro will trade at parity
with the dollar in 2011 as the region’s sovereign debt burden
weighs on the shared currency, Taylor said.   The yen may strengthen to 75 versus the dollar in a month,
Taylor said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
