Sintonia SA said it purchased an
additional 3.2 percent stake in Atlantia SpA for 309.6 million
euros, boosting its holding to 42.245 percent. The company said
in a statement late yesterday it bought the shares for 16 euros
each from Aabar Infrastructure Gmbh. It said the current market
price of Atlantia shares didn’t reflect the company’s growth
prospects.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
