An overview of activity since
markets closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES  New York: Most U.S. stocks retreated as 3M Co. led industrial
shares lower after cutting its profit forecast and Apple Inc.
paced declines in technology companies, wiping out an early
advance triggered by higher-than-estimated results at Exxon
Mobil Corp.
*3M slumped 6 percent, the most since May, after saying
full-year earnings will be 6 cents lower than previously
forecast.
*The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1 percent
to 1,182.24 at 2:41 p.m. in New York after climbing as much as
0.6 percent earlier.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 24.75 points, or 0.2
percent, to 11,101.53.  London: U.K. stocks rose for the first time in three days as
higher metals prices and a weaker U.S. dollar boosted raw-
materials companies.
*The benchmark FTSE 100 Index advanced 31.87, or 0.6 percent, to
5,677.89 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London.  Hong Kong: Hong Kong stocks rose, driving the Hang Seng Index
higher for the first time in three days, after Bank of China Ltd.
and Jiangxi Copper Co. reported higher profit.
*The Hang Seng Index increased 0.2 percent to 23,210.86 at the
close, after falling as much as 0.1 percent.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.8
percent to 4,684.90 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney,
set for a second straight monthly advance. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index advanced 0.3 percent to 3,290 at the 5 p.m. close in
Wellington, poised for a fourth consecutive monthly gain.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar fell against all of its most-traded
counterparts on renewed demand for higher-returning assets as
traders speculated the Federal Reserve will debase the currency
by buying government debt.
*The dollar depreciated 1.2 percent to $1.3935 per euro at 1:54
p.m. in New York, from $1.3769 yesterday.
*The U.S. currency fell 0.8 percent to 81.06 yen, from 81.75 yen,
after touching the 15-year low of 80.41 yen on Oct. 25.
*The euro gained 0.3 percent to 112.92 yen, from 112.58 yen.  COMMODITIES  New York: Gold gained for the first time in three days in New
York as a sliding dollar spurred demand for the metal as an
alternative asset.

to settle at $1,342.50 an ounce at 1:59 p.m. on the Comex in New

investments.

percent, to close at $3.7875 a pound at 1:31 p.m. on the Comex
in New York.  OIL  New York: Crude oil rose as the dollar tumbled against all of
its most-traded counterparts on speculation the Federal Reserve
will curb the currency’s value by buying government debt.
