Gruma SAB , Mexico’s biggest maker of
corn flour for tortillas, climbed for a ninth day on speculation
that the company may sell its stake in  Grupo Financiero Banorte
SAB .  Gruma surged 5.1 percent to 24.94 pesos at 4 p.m. New York
time in Mexico City trading. The shares have climbed 34 percent
since Oct. 15 as they advanced for the longest streak since
August 2006.  Speculation that the company will sell its 8.8 percent
stake in Banorte is probably driving the rally, Deutsche Bank AG
said today in a note from analyst  Jose Yordan . Selling the
Banorte stake would “significantly” reduce debt, he said.  “The main upside risk, in addition to strong FX and
cheaper raw materials, is the potential sale of the Banorte
stake,” Yordan said in the note e-mailed today.  Yordan said the speculation of an imminent sale was
“dubious.” Gruma was cut to “hold” from “buy” today at
Deutsche Bank AG. The company was also cut to “underperform”
from “outperform” at Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer SA,
according to a separate e-mailed report.  Third-quarter net income rose to 238.4 million pesos ($19.3
million) from 45.4 million pesos in the year-earlier period,
Gruma said yesterday in a statement. Sales dropped 5 percent to
11.8 billion pesos.  Banorte, Mexico’s third-largest bank by outstanding loans,
rose 1 percent to 53.61 pesos.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 1.75 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $5.79 a bushel. The price has climbed 17 percent in
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
