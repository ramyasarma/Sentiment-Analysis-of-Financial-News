Wuhan Iron & Steel Co. , the publicly
traded unit of China’s third-biggest steelmaker, said third-
quarter profit fell 49.5 percent from a year ago as higher raw-
material costs undercut increased output.  Net income dropped to 276.3 million yuan ($41.3 million),
or 0.035 yuan a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from
546.6 million yuan, or 0.07 yuan a share, a year ago, the Hubei
province-based company said today to the Shanghai stock exchange.
Sales rose to 18.5 billion yuan from 13.9 billion yuan.  Steel prices  in China fell as much as 17 percent from April
to July as the government introduced measures to curb property
speculation. Iron ore costs rose in the third quarter,
outweighing higher steel production as the company started
operation of a new cold-rolling plant.  Wuhan Steel  declined 1.5 percent to 5.11 yuan today in
Shanghai, compared with a 0.2 percent drop in the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index.  A new cold-rolling plant started production on June 25, and
a silicon-steel plant reached full capacity in May, Wuhan Steel
has said. These plants will increase output of steel products by
24 percent to 15.5 million tons this year from 12.5 million tons
in 2009, Industrial Securities Co. said in a note Oct. 12.  Wuhan’s steel-product output, used in automobiles,
appliances and power generators, may rise to 16.5 million tons
in 2011 and 17.1 million tons in 2012, the broker said.  On Trend  Some other Chinese steelmakers posted a drop in third-
quarter earnings. Profit at Maanshan Iron & Steel Co., China’s
second-biggest Hong Kong-traded steelmaker, fell 99.6 percent to
3.04 million yuan as demand slowed and high prices of raw
materials eroded margins. Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Co.,
China’s biggest producer of the rust-proof alloy, said net
income plunged 75 percent to 181 million yuan.  Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s second-
and third-largest iron ore suppliers, demanded a 22 percent
increase in third-quarter iron ore prices, according to
UC361.com analyst Hu Kai. The miners this year dropped a custom
of setting annual prices for steelmaking commodities in favor of
quarterly agreements as they bet on rising prices.  -- Helen Yuan , with assistance from  Wang Ying . Editor: Andrew
