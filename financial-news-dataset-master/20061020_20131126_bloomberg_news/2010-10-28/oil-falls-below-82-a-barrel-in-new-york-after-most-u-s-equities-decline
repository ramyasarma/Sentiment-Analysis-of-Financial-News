Oil declined in New York after most
U.S. equities fell, signaling a recovery in fuel demand in the
world’s biggest crude consuming nation may falter.  Futures gave up yesterday’s 0.3 percent gain after about
five stocks dropped for every four that advanced on U.S.
exchanges.  Crude supplies surged  5.01 million barrels to 366.2
million in the week ended Oct. 22, the biggest increase since
July, an Oct. 27 Energy Department report showed.  “The markets are wildly choppy,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief
market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St.
Louis. “Oil traders are looking at the dollar and stocks for
direction. We will have to wait for the fundamentals to improve
before prices can move much higher.”  The December contract slipped as much as 32 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $81.86 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $81.94 at 9:46 a.m. Sydney
time. Yesterday it climbed 24 cents to $82.18. Prices are up 0.3
percent this week and 2.5 percent higher for the month. Crude
has added 3.3 percent this year.  Oil gained yesterday after the dollar tumbled against most
major currencies amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will
curb the greenback’s value by buying government debt. A weaker
U.S. currency boosts investor demand for raw materials.  The dollar traded little changed at $1.3929 a euro, after
slumping 1.2 percent to $1.3930.  U.S. Economy  Crude also advanced as initial U.S. jobless claims
unexpectedly declined 21,000 to a three-month low of 434,000
last week, signaling the labor market may be on the mend.  U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 2 percent annual
pace in the third quarter, up from a 1.7 percent rate in the
previous three months, based on the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News poll of economists before a Commerce Department
report today.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1 percent to
1,183.78 at the 4 p.m. close in New York after rising as much as
0.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.33 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 11,113.95.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase shipments by 1.5 percent in the four weeks to Nov. 13,
according to Oil Movements, which monitors tanker charters. The
group will export 23.41 million barrels a day during the period,
the Halifax, England-based consultant said yesterday in a
report. The data exclude Ecuador and Angola.  Brent crude for December settlement advanced 36 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $83.59 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
