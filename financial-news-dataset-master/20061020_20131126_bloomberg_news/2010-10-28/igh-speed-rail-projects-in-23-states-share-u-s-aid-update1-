High-speed rail projects in 23 U.S.
states will share $2.4 billion in federal aid, Transportation
Secretary  Ray LaHood  said today, adding to $8 billion in
stimulus money already awarded for passenger train service.  California will receive $901 million, including $715
million for lines in the Central Valley in projects announced on
Oct. 26 by state officials, and Florida will get $800 million to
build a high-speed corridor from Tampa to Orlando, LaHood said
in a statement. The aid goes to 54 projects, the statement said.  “Demand for high-speed rail dollars is intense and it
demonstrates just how important this historic initiative is,”
LaHood said in the statement.  The Obama administration has been boosting U.S. investment
in rail projects, announcing in January the award of economic
stimulus money to jump-start projects in 13 high-speed rail
corridors. California and Florida won 45 percent of the January
grants.  The northeast region, which includes New York, received
$198 million. The  Northeast Corridor , where Amtrak operates its
Acela trains between Washington and Boston, will receive $32.5
million to study and plan an expansion of Boston’s South Station
and $13.3 million to build 1.5 miles of track and replace a
bridge to accommodate faster trains near Wilmington, Delaware,
according to the Transportation Department.  To contact the reporters on this story:
