Mitsubishi Motors Corp. , maker of
the i-MiEV electric car, lowered its second-half net income
forecast 17 percent because of the yen’s strength.  The Tokyo-based automaker expects net income of 19.9
billion yen ($245 million) in the six months ending March 31,
compared with an earlier forecast of 24 billion yen, according
to a Bloomberg calculation based on the company’s first-half
earnings statement today.  The automaker said last week its first-half loss narrowed
to 4.9 billion yen from 36.4 billion yen a year earlier after
sales increased. The company had forecast a 9 billion yen loss
for the period. Mitsubishi Motors kept its full-year profit
forecast of 15 billion yen as a stronger Japanese currency may
cut full-year operating profit by 35 billion yen.  The carmaker revised its full-year currency outlook to 85
yen to the dollar from 90 yen, and 113 yen to the euro from 120
yen. For the fiscal second half that began Oct. 1, the automaker
based its forecast on an exchange rate of 82 yen to the dollar.  Mitsubishi Motors fell 3 percent to close at 97 yen in
Tokyo trading.  Separately,  Hino Motors Ltd. , Japan’s biggest maker of
heavy-duty trucks, lowered its full-year net income forecast
today by 27 percent to 8 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
