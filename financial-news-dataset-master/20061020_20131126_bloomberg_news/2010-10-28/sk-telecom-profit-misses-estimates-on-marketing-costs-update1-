SK Telecom Co. , South Korea’s
largest mobile-phone operator, reported an unexpected fall in
third-quarter profit after an increase in marketing costs and
investment in network expansions.  Net income  dropped 13 percent to 363.9 billion won
($322 million), the Seoul-based company said in a statement
today. That was lower than the 425 billion-won average of 12
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 4.1 percent
to 3.18 trillion won.  Spending on marketing rose 1.5 percent to 751 billion won
as the company increased sales promotions last month to counter
the debut of Apple Inc.’s iPhone 4, offered exclusively by rival
KT Corp. SK plans to invest 1 trillion won to develop mapping,
instant-messaging and social-networking services for handsets.  “Marketing costs were a bit high,” said Choi Nam Gon, a
Seoul-based analyst at Tong Yang Securities Inc. “The company
has said they’ll reduce market costs to follow the government’s
guideline, but it looks like the circumstances to do that
weren’t there.”  SK’s investments gained 69 percent in the quarter as it
expanded wireless networks to accommodate an increase in data
transfers on mobile devices.  Smartphones  Operating profit fell 16 percent to 519.3 billion won,
missing the 565 billion-won average of nine analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Wireless Internet sales increased 16
percent from a year earlier, the company said.  SK  shares fell 0.3 percent to 172,000 won, the lowest level
in one week, at the close of trading on the Korea Exchange,
while the benchmark Kospi index declined 0.1 percent.  The company has more than 55 percent share in the
smartphone market of South Korea, where about 4.5 million
devices were sold by the end of third quarter, according  Park Jong Soo , a Seoul-based analyst at Hanwha Securities Co.  More than 1 million iPhones were sold in South Korea since
the first model went on sale in the country at the end of 2009,
according to  KT Corp.   The Korea Communications Commission  said in March it will
require phone companies to limit marketing costs to 22 percent
of total revenue in 2010 and at about 20 percent from next year.
SK’s marketing expenses accounted for 24 percent of its total
sales, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
