Germany’s lower house of parliament
is set to back plans to give the financial industry two more
years to adjust to revamped securitization rules that may be
tougher than in other European Union countries.  The agreement, which follows proposals made by a mediation
committee, means that from Jan. 1, 2015, financial companies can
only invest in securitizations if the seller keeps at least 10
percent of the risk on his books. The decision, scheduled to be
waved through without discussion at about 2 p.m., was delayed
after a debate on nuclear power ran over by at least 3 hours.  Lawmakers earlier this year sought to move from a 5 percent
retention rate, effective from next year, to a 10 percent rate
on Jan. 1, 2013. States including Hesse, where  Frankfurt ,
Germany’s financial center, is located, opposed the legislation
in the upper house of parliament and called for mediation.  Germany’s “go it alone” approach will hamper the market
for securitizations and make it harder for small and medium-
sized companies to raise capital, the upper house, or Bundesrat,
said on Sept. 28. An EU directive calls for originators to
retain a risk of at least 5 percent.  The bill is a response to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis
that set off the financial crisis and a global recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
