Aramex PJSC , the Middle East’s
biggest courier company, will carry out a number of acquisitions
by the end of this year as part of its expansion plans, Chief
Executive Officer  Fadi Ghandour  said.  “We are continuing in our acquisition strategy in Africa
and Asia,” Ghandour said in an interview today by phone from
India. “We will before the end of the year announce a couple of
acquisitions in Africa. They will be our entry into key markets
over there.”  The courier, which is based in the United Arab Emirates,
has a presence in Europe, India, Singapore and Hong Kong, and
competes with international logistics and courier companies such
as Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc. and Memphis,
Tennessee-based FedEx Corp. The company’s stock price is up 49.3
percent since the beginning of the year.  Aramex’s overall profit for the year will be “double
digits and we will continue in line with our results of the
first three quarters of the year,” Ghandour said.  The company’s third-quarter profit increased 12 percent to
46.7 million dirhams ($12.7 million) from 41.7 million dirhams
in the year-earlier period.  Aramex, founded by Ghandour in 1982, became the first Arab-
based company to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1997. It
was later taken private by Abraaj Capital Ltd., and then went
public again in 2005, with its shares trading on the Dubai
Financial Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
