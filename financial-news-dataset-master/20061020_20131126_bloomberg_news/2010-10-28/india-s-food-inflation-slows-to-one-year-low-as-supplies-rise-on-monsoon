India’s food inflation slowed to
near a one-year low as the heaviest monsoon rainfall in three
years boosted production of rice and corn.  An  index  measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products compiled by the commerce ministry rose 13.75 percent in
the week ended Oct. 16 from a year earlier, according to a
statement in New Delhi today. The index gained 15.53 percent the
previous week.  The Reserve Bank of India is relying on lower farm prices
to cool the benchmark wholesale-price inflation rate to 6
percent by March 31 from 8.62 percent in September. The bank,
which has raised interest rates five times this year, is due to
release its next monetary policy statement on Nov. 2.  “Food inflation has started moderating because the record
rainfalls have resulted in a good crop production,” said  N.R. Bhanumurthy , an economist at the New Delhi-based National
Institute of Public Finance and Policy.  Even so, Bhanumurthy expects the central bank to raise
rates by a quarter-point next week as the benchmark wholesale-
price inflation rate is more than the central bank’s “comfort
zone” of between 4 percent and 5 percent.  The central bank’s  reverse repurchase rate  is 5 percent and
the repurchase rate is 6 percent.  Production of grains including rice sown at the start of
the country’s June-to-September rainy season may rise to 114.63
million tons from 103.84 million tons a year earlier, according
to the farm ministry.  The country got 911 millimeters (35.9 inches) of rainfall
between June 1 and Sept. 29, exceeding the 50-year average of
889.2 millimeters, according to data from the  India
Meteorological Department . That’s the heaviest since 2007 and
matches the agency’s forecast in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
