Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim , the
world’s richest man, is driving the advance in the nation’s
benchmark IPC stock index.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that Slim’s three biggest
companies in the measure, which account for 33 percent of its
weight, are responsible for the IPC’s 9.8 percent gain this
year. Without them, the index would be down 18.6 percent.  Slim, 70, positioned himself to become a driving force in
the Mexican economy by investing during the crises of the 1980s,
said  Martin Lara , an analyst at Itau Securities in Mexico City.
That helped him amass a net worth of more than $60 billion,
making him the world’s richest man, according to Forbes
magazine. Mexico defaulted on its sovereign debt in September
1982, presaging a decade in which companies missed bond payments
and company valuations tumbled.  “Everyone was buying dollars, and Slim was buying assets
in Mexico,” Lara said.  America Movil SAB, Slim’s wireless carrier that accounts
for 26 percent of the index by weight, has climbed 15 percent
this year. Grupo Carso SAB, the Slim holding company that makes
up 2.4 percent of the measure, has climbed 76 percent this year.
Grupo Financiero Inbursa SA, his financial services firm,
climbed 41 percent.  Telefonos de Mexico SAB , Slim’s fixed-line
and internet provider that is his smallest company in the IPC by
weighting, has declined 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
