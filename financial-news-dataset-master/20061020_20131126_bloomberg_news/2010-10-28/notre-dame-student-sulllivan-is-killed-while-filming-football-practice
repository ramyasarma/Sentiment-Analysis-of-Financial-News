A University of Notre Dame student
was killed when a video tower fell over while he was filming
football practice.  Declan Sullivan, 20, was filming for the Department of
Athletics from a hydraulic scissor lift when the accident
occurred at 4:50 p.m. yesterday at the LaBar Practice Complex on
the southeast side of the campus, the university said on its
website.  “The loss of someone so young is a terrible shock and a
great sadness,” Notre Dame President John I. Jenkins said in a
statement.  Sullivan, a junior, died at Memorial Hospital in South
Bend, Indiana. His sister, Gwyneth, also is a student at Notre 
Dame.  “Declan was a diligent student worker in our video
department and had a tremendous personality and great sense of
humor,” said Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly.  The cause of the accident is under investigation, the
school said.  The South Bend area was under a hazardous weather outlook
that called for sustained winds of 25 to 35 miles per hour with
gusts of 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour), according
to the National Weather Service.  The Fighting Irish (4-4) host the University of Tulsa
tomorrow at Notre Dame Stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
