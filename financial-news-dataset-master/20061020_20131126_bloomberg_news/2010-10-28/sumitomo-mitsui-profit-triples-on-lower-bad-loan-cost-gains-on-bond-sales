Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. , Japan’s second-largest bank by market value, said first-
half profit more than tripled as bad-loan costs declined and it
posted gains from the sale of bond holdings.  Net income  rose to 410 billion yen ($5 billion) in the six
months ended Sept. 30, from 123.5 billion yen a year earlier,
the lender said in a preliminary earnings statement filed to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange today. That compares with its previous
forecast of 160 billion yen made in May, the statement said.  Japanese corporate bankruptcies have declined for 14
straight months, helping the country’s lenders cut default
costs. Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui’s bond sales have benefited
from rising prices of U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government
debt as the Bank of Japan expands asset purchases to spur the
economy and the Federal Reserve prepares to do the same.  “Contributors to Sumitomo Mitsui’s improved bottom line
would be fewer bankruptcies in the country that’s lowering the
bank’s credit costs, and higher profit from sales of bonds as
the lender reshuffled securities holdings,”  Yoshinobu Yamada ,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said today before the
announcement.  Bad-loan costs fell to about 45 billion yen, compared with
a forecast of 110 billion yen, Sumitomo Mitsui said.  Business failures fell 4.6 percent in September to 1,102
cases from a year earlier, according to Tokyo Shoko Research
Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
