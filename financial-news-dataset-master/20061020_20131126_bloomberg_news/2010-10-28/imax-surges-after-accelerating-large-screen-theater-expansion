Imax Corp., the operator of large-
screen movie theaters, rose as much as 11 percent after third-
quarter profit beat estimates and the company raised its
forecast for new-theater installations.  Imax climbed $1.98 to $20.83 at 3:01 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading , after reaching $21, a six-month
high. The shares had climbed 42 percent this year before today,
driven by Imax’s expansion strategy.  Imax said it is likely to install 75 to 85 more screens
next year, versus a previous forecast for 55 to 60. Depending on
whether the systems are leased or co-owned, they add $400,000 to
$800,000 each in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, said  Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush
Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. He expects the installations
to boost earnings by 15 or 20 cents a share.  “They get a lot of leverage from that,” Pachter said in
an interview. “Earnings next year just got 20 cents better.”  Net income was $6.74 million, or 10 cents a share, versus
$1.06 million, or 2 cents, a year earlier, Imax said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, profit of 15 cents a share
beating the 9-cent average of eight analysts’ estimates.  The company said separately that the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission ordered an investigation of issues that have
been subject to an informal inquiry since June 2006.  The commission acted around Sept. 3, following informal
inquiries that the company believes relate to the timing of
recognition of the company’s theater system installation revenue
in 2005, Imax said in a regulatory  filing . The company said it
is cooperating with the SEC.  Whit Clay , an outside spokesman for Imax, said the company
declined to comment on the probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
