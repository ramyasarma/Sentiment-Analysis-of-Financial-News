The Carlyle Group expects to make
two deals in the Middle East and North Africa within nine
months, the firm’s regional chief said.  Carlyle is looking at industries that include retail,
infrastructure and manufacturing,  Walid Musallam , managing
director, head of the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey
buyout fund, said in an interview today at the World Economic
Forum in Marrakesh, Morocco.  “Our key focus countries are Turkey, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia,” he said. “But we also look at other countries in the
GCC; particularly Kuwait and the U.A.E. and in North Africa we
also look at Morocco.”  The economies of oil-exporting countries in the region are
expected to expand 3.8 percent this year while the economies of
oil importers in the region, along with Afghanistan and
Pakistan, are forecast to grow 5 percent, according to the
International Monetary Fund. That compares with expected growth
of 2.6 percent in the U.S.  Washington-based Carlyle Group raised $500 million for its
first Middle East and North Africa fund in March last year after
seeking as much as twice that amount. The company said March 29
it bought a 30 percent stake in General Lighting Co., Saudi
Arabia’s biggest lighting-fixtures manufacturer, without
disclosing its price.  In December 2009, Carlyle announced it bought 40 percent of
Turkish hospital operator  Medical Park Saglik Grubu AS .  To contact the reporter on this story:
