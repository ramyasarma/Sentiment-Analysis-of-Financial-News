South African house prices in the
so-called middle segment of the market averaged nominal growth
of 5.4 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same
period the previous year, said Absa Group Ltd.  That raised the average price of a home in the middle
segment of the market to 1.02 million rand in the third quarter,
Johannesburg-based Absa said in a research note. House prices
rose an annual 1.8 percent over the period, when adjusted for
the effects of inflation, Absa said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
