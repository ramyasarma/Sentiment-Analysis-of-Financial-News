The Swedish krona gained versus the
euro and dollar after data showed retail sales expanded more
than analysts had anticipated, boosting confidence the central
bank will keep raising interest rates.  Retail sales  grew 5.5 percent year on year in September, up
from 4.5 percent the previous month, Stockholm-based Statistics
Sweden said today. That beat the 4.2 percent median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The nation’s central bank this
week scaled back long-term targets for rate increases, citing
slowing economic growth elsewhere in the world. Sweden relies on
exports for half its economic output.  “The Riksbank will be quite pleased with the retail sales
numbers, adding a little more growth to the third quarter,”
said  Niels Christensen , the Copenhagen-based chief currency
strategist at Nordea Bank AB. “Domestic economic data is one of
the key drivers for the krona because it drives rate
expectations.”  The Swedish currency strengthened 1 percent to 6.7149 per
dollar at 3:49 p.m. in London today. It was little changed at
9.3327 versus the euro.  The krona has risen 4.5 percent over the past year against
a basket of currencies according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
