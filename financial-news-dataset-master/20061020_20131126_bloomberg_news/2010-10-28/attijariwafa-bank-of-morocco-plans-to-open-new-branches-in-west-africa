Attijariwafa Bank, the largest
publicly traded lender in Morocco, is planning to open more
branches in West Africa, Co-Chief Executive Officer  Ismail Douiri  said.  “We want to expand around the markets we already have in
West Africa,” Douiri said yesterday in an interview at the
World Economic Forum in Marrakesh.  Attijariwafa operates in 22 countries and has branches in
countries including Congo, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Mali, and
Senegal, according to its website. Douiri said the company plans
to open a branch in Burkina Faso before the end of the year.  Profit at the bank rose 17 percent in the first half of the
year, the bank announced on Sept. 28. Net income advanced to 2.3
billion Moroccan dirhams ($276.2 million).  The bank received approval two years ago in Mauritania to
set up a commercial banking division in conjunction with Banque
Centrale Populaire. Earlier this year, they acquired 60 percent
of the Mauritanian branch of French bank BNP Paribas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
