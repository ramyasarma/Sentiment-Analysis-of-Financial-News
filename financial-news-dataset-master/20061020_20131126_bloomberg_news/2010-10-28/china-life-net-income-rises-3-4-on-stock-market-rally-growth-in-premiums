China Life Insurance Co. , the
nation’s biggest insurer, said third-quarter profit rose 3.4
percent as a rally in the nation’s stock market lifted
investment returns and premiums expanded.  Net income  climbed to 6.91 billion yuan ($1.03 billion)
from a restated 6.68 billion yuan, a year earlier, the Beijing-
based company said in a statement to the Shanghai stock
exchange. Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.24 yuan.  A rebound in the  Shanghai Composite Index  helped China Life
and rivals boost investment yields after the value in their
equity holdings shrank in a market rout in the first half.
Chairman  Yang Chao ’s efforts to curb lower-margin single-premium
products to focus on long-term, regular-premium policies also
bolstered underwriting profitability.  Investment income, mainly dividends and bond yields, for
the three months ended September was 15 billion, the statement
said.  China Life  gained 1 percent to HK$35 in Hong Kong trading
today, before the earnings announcement, paring its decline this
year to 8.7 percent. The benchmark Hang Seng Index has gained
6.1 percent in 2010.  -- Zhang Dingmin . Editors: Andreea Papuc, Josh Fellman  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
