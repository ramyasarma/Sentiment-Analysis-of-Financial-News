     Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) --The People’s Bank of China sold
three-month bills at a yield of 1.77 percent in open-market
operations, according to traders at BOC International (China)
Ltd. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  The yield jumped 20 basis points last week to 1.7726
percent after the central bank raised one-year benchmark lending
and deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Oct. 19,
the first time since 2007.  The monetary authority, which offered 25 billion yuan ($3.7
billion) of the 91-day notes, has let the yield rise at seven
previous auctions this year to help drain cash from the
financial system.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
