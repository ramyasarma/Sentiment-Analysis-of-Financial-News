Automotive suppliers  Lear Corp. ,
 Dana Holding Corp.  and  Federal-Mogul Corp.  reported rising
quarterly profits boosted by higher vehicle production.  Lear, a maker of seats, boosted its sales forecast for this
year to $11.7 billion, $700 million more than it projected in
August. Dana, which makes truck axles and frames, raised its
forecast for  profit  excluding some items this year to as much as
$550 million from an April outlook of as much as $525 million.  U.S. auto sales in September accelerated to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 11.8 million, compared with 9.4 million
a year earlier, according to researcher Autodata Corp. North
American production should rise 38 percent to 11.8 million this
year, according to IHS Automotive.  “This just shows the strength of the underlying
turnaround,”  Brian Johnson , an analyst with Barclays Capital in
Chicago, said in an interview. “Many of these companies used
the downturn to get rid of some of their higher-cost facilities
and they’re building back the work at the lower-cost
factories.”  Lear said third-quarter net income more than tripled to
$95.3 million, or $1.76 a share. Excluding some costs, profit
was $2.28 a share. The average  estimate  of 11 analysts was $1.
Revenue rose 11 percent to $2.82 billion, topping the $2.67
billion average estimate.  Dana Profit  Dana reported a profit of $46 million, or 22 cents a share,
after a loss of $38 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier. The
average estimate of five analysts was for profit of 13 cents a
share.  Lear, based in Southfield, Michigan, rose $1.89, or 2.2
percent, to $87.65 at 4:15 p.m. Dana, based in Toledo, Ohio,
gained 52 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $14.20.  Federal-Mogul , controlled by billionaire  Carl Icahn ,
reported profit excluding some gains was 30 cents a share. On
that basis,  Anthony Cristello , an analyst with BB&T Capital
Markets, estimated profit of 33 cents a share.  Sales of replacement parts fell 3.4 percent to $573 million
as premium products were shunned in favor of lower-priced
options, and volume rose less than 1 percent. The unit accounted
for 44 percent of Federal-Mogul’s $5.3 billion in revenue last
year, up from 38 percent in 2008.  Federal-Mogul fell $2.43, or 11 percent, to $19.30 in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The Southfield, Michigan-
based company’s shares have gained 12 percent this year.  ‘An Overreaction’  “Auto suppliers have for the most part come in well ahead
of expectations, so when one misses, even marginally, it causes
a reaction, and in this case, an overreaction in share
movement,”  Brian Sponheimer , an analyst with Gabelli & Co.,
said in an interview.  Sponheimer said the “weakness” in Federal-Mogul’s
aftermarket results shouldn’t be a “long-term issue.”  Icahn controlled 76 percent of Federal-Mogul’s shares as of
July, leaving 24 percent for public trading. By comparison, Lear
and Dana have 99 percent available for trading. A lower
percentage of shares available can make a stock more volatile.  Federal-Mogul’s  net income  rose to $53 million, or 53 cents
a share, from $10 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier, the
company said today in a statement.  Sales  gained 12 percent to
$1.54 billion as the company gained market share in sales to
automakers in each of its operating regions.  Federal-Mogul trimmed selling, general and administrative
expenses to 10.6 percent of sales from 12.5 percent a year
earlier. The company has been centralizing operations to lower
costs, Chief Executive Officer  Jose Maria Alapont  said.  “We had several areas where we were doing R&D and we had a
lot of office functions,” Alapont said in an interview. “We’ve
been consolidating and are truly globalizing the company through
lean enterprise strategies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
