Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor
Sechin plans to visit Poland tomorrow to meet his counterpart
Waldemar Pawlak, to discuss trade and economic ties, a Sechin
aide who declined to be identified, citing state policy, said by
phone.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is not planning a trip to the
neighboring country today, a government spokesman said. Sechin
is Putin’s deputy in charge of the energy industry.  Warsaw-based Polsat News reported that Putin may fly to
Poland today in connection with tomorrow’s planned signing of a
new long-term deal on Russian natural-gas deliveries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
