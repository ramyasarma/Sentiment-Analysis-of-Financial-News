Moroccan Tourism Minister Yassir
Zenagui said growth in tourism revenue, a major contributor to
the North African state’s economy, is expected to more than
double this year.  Almost 10 million tourists may visit, with revenue growth
accelerating to 14 percent from 6 percent last year, Zenagui
said in an interview recorded yesterday in Marrakesh by
Bloomberg Television. Revenue should reach 56 billion dirhams
($6.9 billion) this year, according to the Tourism Ministry.  The global economic crisis “at its peak slowed down a
little the growth, but the sector and the economy is back and
more tourists are coming to the country,” Zenagui said. “It
proves that is a resilient and robust sector.”  Tourism in Morocco represents almost 10 percent of gross
domestic product. Morocco’s economy is expected to expand 4
percent in 2010, according to the central bank. The government
is forecasting economic growth of 5 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
