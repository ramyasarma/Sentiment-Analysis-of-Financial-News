Exxon Mobil Corp. , the world’s
biggest company, posted its largest third-quarter profit
increase in six years as rising worldwide energy demand lifted
commodity prices.  Third-quarter net income rose 55 percent to $7.35 billion,
or $1.44 a share, from $4.73 billion, or 98 cents, a year
earlier, Irving, Texas-based  Exxon  said in a statement today.
Per-share profit was 5 cents more than the average of 14
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Motorists, airlines and railroads are burning crude-based
fuels at a rate of one supertanker load every 33 minutes this
year, a 2.2 percent increase from 2009, according to Barclays
Capital. Exxon boosted production by more than one-fifth amid a
12 percent jump in U.S. oil futures.  “Exxon already was producing more oil and gas than any of
the other public companies so for them to increase output and by
such a large margin is a good thing,” said  Douglas Ober , whose
$682 million under management at Petroleum & Resources Corp. in
Baltimore includes Exxon stock. “This probably took a lot of
people by surprise.”  The increase in net income was the largest for a third
quarter, excluding one-time gains, since 2004.  Exxon  rose 74
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $66.41 at 9:37 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares, which before today had
declined 3.7 percent this year, have nine buy  ratings  from
analysts, 12 holds and one sell.  Production Increase  Chief Executive Officer  Rex Tillerson  is spending almost
$77 million a day this year to increase oil, natural-gas and
diesel production. Exxon is focusing investments in new wells in
Canada, California and Texas after a bid to acquire offshore
discoveries in Ghana collapsed and a New Zealand prospect was
abandoned as too risky.  Exxon increased  production  21 percent to the equivalent of
4.45 million barrels a day, the most since the first three
months of 2006. The output increase was driven in part by
Exxon’s purchase of natural-gas producer XTO Energy, its largest
acquisition since the 1999 merger with Mobil Corp.  Sales rose 16 percent to $95.3 billion and profit from oil
and gas wells climbed 36 percent to $5.47 billion. Profit from
company’s refineries more than tripled to $1.16 billion as the
 margin  between the cost of crude and the price of gasoline and
diesel widened. Exxon’s chemicals business posted a 40 percent
profit increase to $1.23 billion.  The company said it purchased $3.3 billion of its own
shares during the quarter and plans to make another $5 billion
in buybacks before the end of the year.  Cash Flow  Exxon’s cash flow from operations and asset sales jumped 54
percent from a year earlier to $13.9 billion, according to a
public filing today.  The company has exceeded the average per-share profit
estimates of analysts in three of the past four quarters,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Global oil demand implications have continued to surprise
to the upside,” a team of Barclays analysts including  Costanza Jacazio  and  Amrita Sen  said in an Oct. 20 note to clients. Oil
futures in New York averaged $76.21 a barrel during the third
quarter.  Rising oil and gas prices spurred energy producers to
complete 123 U.S. wells a day during the July-to-September
period, a 45 percent increase from a year earlier, according to
an Oct. 26 statement from the  American Petroleum Institute . The
trade group, based in Washington, represents more than 400
energy companies, including Exxon.  Congo Sale  Exxon completed its $34.9 billion  acquisition  of XTO Energy
of Fort Worth, Texas, on June 28, two days before the start of
the third quarter.  In August, Exxon put up for sale its stake in discoveries
off the coast of the Republic of Congo. The company owns a 30
percent stake in the fields, which hold the equivalent of 500
million barrels of recoverable crude, according to an Aug. 3
posting on  Schlumberger Ltd. ’s asset-sale website.  ConocoPhillips, the third-biggest U.S. energy company,
yesterday said third-quarter profit more than doubled.
Occidental Petroleum Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. oil company,
said Oct. 19 that net income rose 28 percent to $1.19 billion,
helped by gains in its Phibro LLC energy-trading unit and
chemical business.  Chevron Corp. , the second-largest U.S. energy company, is
scheduled to report earnings tomorrow.  Worldwide demand for crude is averaging 86.6 million
barrels a day this year and is expected to rise to 88.1 million
a day in 2011, the Barclays analysts said. The price of
benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude will average $106 a
barrel in 2012 and $137 in 2015, Barclays said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
