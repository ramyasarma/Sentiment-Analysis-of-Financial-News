FriendFinder Networks Inc. , the
Penthouse magazine publisher vying to acquire  Playboy
Enterprises Inc. , has completed a $551 million debt financing,
the company said today in a statement.  FriendFinder, which operates adult-themed websites, had
planned to issue $296 million of senior secured bonds due in
2013 to recapitalize, simplify its capital structure and extend
maturities, Standard & Poor’s said this month.  The company, based in Boca Raton, Florida, said in July
that it would bid $210 million for Playboy, a 14 percent premium
to the $5.50-a-share offer that founder  Hugh M. Hefner  made days
earlier for the Class A and Class B shares he doesn’t own. In
August, Playboy formed a board panel to evaluate Hefner’s bid,
which values the company at $185 million.  Hefner, 84, controls 70 percent of Chicago-based Playboy’s
Class A  voting  stock and 28 percent of the Class B  non-voting 
stock. He said on July 13 that he isn’t interested in selling
his stake or talking with a financial sponsor other than his
partner Rizvi Traverse Management LLC.  FriendFinder Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bell  said in a
letter to the Playboy board at the time of his bid that
FriendFinder had contacted lenders to back the acquisition
though it hadn’t secured financing.  FriendFinder this year postponed an initial public offering
that was planned to raise as much as $240 million, according to
a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filing. The
company was selling a 49 percent stake and said it would use the
proceeds to pay down debt.  The company lost money in 2006, 2007, 2008 and for the
first nine months of 2009, according to the SEC filings. It had
$409.5 million in long-term debt as of Sept. 30, 2009, the most
recent figures available because the offering was delayed.  Playboy’s Class B shares fell 1 cent to $5.03 yesterday in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . They have gained 57
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
