Hong Kong  stocks  fell, paring the
Hang Seng Index’s monthly gain, after Bank of Communications Co.
and  China Life Insurance Co.  reported earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates. AIA Group Ltd. rose on its first day of
trading.  BoCom , China’s fifth-largest lender, tumbled 7.8 percent.
China Life slid 3 percent and was the greatest drag on the Hang
Seng Index.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. , the biggest Hong Kong-listed
clothier, declined 2 percent after reporting sales fell 9
percent.  AIA , the insurer sold by American International Group
Inc. in a $17.8 billion initial public offering, surged 17
percent.  The  Hang Seng Index  declined 0.5 percent to 23,096.32 at
the close. That pared the measure’s gain this month to 3.3
percent. The index has fallen 3.2 percent since Oct. 14, when
U.S. reports showed jobless claims unexpectedly rising and the
country’s trade deficit widening, increasing speculation the
Federal Reserve will act to shore up the world’s largest economy.  “There’s a lot of noise about more quantitative easing in
the U.S.,” said  Steven Leung , director of institutional sales
at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong. “So many people are locking
in profit. There’ll be a few more banks reporting earnings later
today, and we’ll need to see what they have to say about
provisions.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies dropped 1.2 percent to
13,168.68.  Twice as many stocks fell as advanced on the 45-member Hang
Seng Index. Futures on the index slipped 0.6 percent to 22,973.  To contact the reporter on this story:
