U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index was little
changed, after swinging between gains and losses more than five
times today, as investors speculated about the outcome of next
week’s U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.  Scottish & Southern Electricity Plc led utility shares
higher after Britain’s second-biggest power producer said it
will raise natural gas prices.  British Airways  paced declining
shares, dropping 3.6 percent even after reporting earnings that
topped analysts’ estimates.  The  FTSE 100 Index  slipped 2.73, or 0.1 percent, to
5,675.16 at the close in London. The benchmark gauge dropped 1.2
percent this week, paring its rally this month to 2.3 percent,
as investors speculated whether the Fed will announce sufficient
measures to keep the recovery on track. The FTSE All-Share Index
and Ireland’s ISEQ Index both closed little changed today.  “It has been a jittery week for stock markets,” said
London-based David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index.
There are concerns “that markets have been taking it for
granted that there will be more sizeable assistance to come from
central banks.”
      Scottish & Southern  rallied 3.4 percent to 1,153 pence as
the power producer said it will increase natural gas prices for
U.K. households by 9.4 percent in December, the first supplier
to do so this year.  Centrica, Drax  About 3.6 million customers will be affected by the
increase. Based on a consumption of 16,500 kilowatt-hours, the
typical annual bill will increase by 4.64 pounds ($7.38) a month
to 650 pounds. The price rise will help the company stem losses
from its Southern Electric Gas Ltd. unit, which made a loss of
58.7 million pounds in the fiscal year ending March 31.
      Centrica , Britain’s biggest energy supplier, gained 3.2
percent to 332.2 pence. Drax Group Plc increased 1.2 percent to
380.7 pence, while National Grid Plc rose 1.1 percent to 590
pence.  British Airways dropped 3.6 percent to 270.7 pence even as
Europe’s third-largest airline posted a profit of 220 million
pounds, its first profit in two years. The carrier said the
outlook depends on a global economic environment that remains
unclear.  “Despite a solid set of numbers from British Airways,
shareholders are keen to take money off the table today,” said
London-based  Manoj Ladwa , a senior trader at ETX Capital.
“Given the company’s uncertain outlook on the economy and the
strong rally in its share price, investors are finding little
reason to remain long British Airways at current levels.”  The stock, the best performer in the eight-company
Bloomberg  EMEA Airlines Index  after Spain’s Iberia Lineas Aereas
de Espana SA, has surged 46 percent so far this year.  AZ, Soco  AZ Electronic Materials SA, the chemical maker partly owned
by Carlyle Group, climbed 6.3 percent to 255 pence in the first
day of trading after its 383 million-pound ($613.3 million)
initial public offering.  Soco International Plc  rallied 4.5 percent to 313.6 pence
after BofA-Merrill Lynch Global Research upgraded the U.K.
energy explorer to “buy” from “neutral.”  F&C Asset Management Plc gained 1.5 percent to 67 pence
after the firm reported a 14 percent increase in assets under
management in the third quarter as markets rose and the firm
bought hedge fund Thames River Capital Group. Numis Securities
upgraded the shares to “add” from “hold.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
