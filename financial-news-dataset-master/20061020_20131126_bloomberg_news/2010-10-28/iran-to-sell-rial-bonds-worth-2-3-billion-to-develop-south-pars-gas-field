Iran will sell rial bonds worth $2.3
billion on Nov. 6 to finance the second development phase of its
South Pars gas field,  Mehr  reported, citing a senior energy
official.  The bonds will be sold through Iran’s Saderat Bank and
Melli Bank, Pars Oil and Gas Co.’s managing director Ali Vakili
told the state-run news service.  Iran sold in August about $500 million worth of bonds for
the first development phase of the gas deposit, the Oil Ministry
 said at the time. The three-year bonds, yielding 16 percent,
were auctioned by the bank on Aug. 21, it said.  Iran’s plans to develop South Pars , the world’s biggest
single gas deposit, which it shares with Qatar, has faced delays
because of international sanctions over the country’s nuclear
program. The U.S. and its western allies say the program is a
cover for developing atomic weapons, a claim Iran rejects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
