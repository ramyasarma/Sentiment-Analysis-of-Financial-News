Malaysia’s ringgit and India’s rupee
declined on speculation the Federal Reserve will pump money into
the U.S. economy only gradually, reducing the amount of funds
that can be invested in higher-yielding assets.  The ringgit weakened 0.1 percent to 3.1115 as of 4:35 p.m.
in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupee dropped 0.1 percent to 44.4995 and the Chinese yuan fell
0.1 percent to 6.6886. The U.S. central bank will purchase less
debt through a plan to be unveiled next week than the $2
trillion program it embarked upon during the financial crisis,
according to the Wall Street Journal.  “I don’t think the Fed is going to print as much money as
the first quantitative easing,” said  Godwin Chan , a foreign-
exchange trader at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“The market is too much ahead of itself. Asian currencies will
be sold off.”  Estimates for the size of the asset-purchase program range
from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch to $2 trillion
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., with economists at both firms
agreeing the Fed will likely start by announcing $500 billion
after its Nov. 2-3 meeting. The Federal Reserve asked bond
dealers and investors for projections of central-bank asset
purchases over the next six months, according to a New York Fed
survey obtained by Bloomberg News.  Malaysia’s currency lost 0.3 percent yesterday, the most in
a week, after Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said the central bank
doesn’t want sudden movements in the exchange rate and favors a
gradual strengthening of the ringgit. The currency has gained 10
percent this year, the second-best performance in Asia excluding
Japan.  Fundamental Level  The rupiah traded little changed at 8,935, compared with
8,933 yesterday. It earlier slid to its lowest level in a month
after Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution said yesterday the
rupiah’s “fundamental” level is between 8,900 and 9,300
against the dollar. The central bank will “guard” the rupiah
at its fundamental level and buy foreign currencies to curb
volatility, he said.  South Korea’s won appreciated for the first time in three
days, gaining 0.4 percent to 1,123.70, after the government
raised its 2010 economic growth forecast and a central bank
report showed the nation’s current-account surplus widened to
$4.06 billion in September from a revised $2.19 billion in
August.  The currency recovered from earlier losses after Finance
Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said the economy will probably expand 6
percent in 2010, faster than an earlier projection of 5.8
percent.  “The currency is gaining ground after Yoon’s comments,”
said Yun Se Min, a currency trader at Busan Bank in Seoul. “The
current-account surplus is a positive factor for the currency.”  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.3 percent to
NT$30.824, the Singapore dollar gained 0.1 percent to S$1.2998
and the Philippine peso rose 0.3 percent to 43.106. The Thai
baht was unchanged at 29.97.  To contact the reporters on this story:
