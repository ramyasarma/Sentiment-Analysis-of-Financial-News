Paine & Partners, a U.S. private
equity firm, is expected to bid for Pacific Equity Partners’
Tegel Foods, the Australian Financial Review reported in its
Street Talk column without saying where it got the information.
Paine is being advised by Barclays Capital and UBS AG, and
Morgan Stanley and Greenhill Caliburn Pty Ltd. are advising
Pacific Equity, the newspaper said. Brazilian meat company JBS
SA and Blackstone Group LP, which were thought to be considering
bids for the New Zealand company, may have dropped out,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
