European Commission President Jose
Barroso and European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said that
the Group of 20 should reaffirm its commitment “towards more
market oriented exchange rate systems that reflect underlying
economic fundamentals and refrain from competitive devaluation
of currencies.” Barroso and Van Rompuy made their remarks in an
e-mailed statement today before a meeting of the EU’s 27
national leaders in Brussels.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
