India’s 10-year bonds held near the
lowest level in a week on speculation the central bank will take
steps to ease a shortage of cash in the banking system.  Lenders  borrowed  an average of 878.7 billion rupees ($19.7
billion) from the central bank’s repurchase auction window this
week, compared with 634 billion rupees last week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Reserve Bank of India may
consider measures such as reducing the bond-reserve requirement
for banks to boost cash, said  Nirav Dalal , head of debt capital
markets at Yes Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  “Any decision to ease liquidity may come only in the
policy review,” he said. “This is also the peak season for
credit growth.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 rose 1 basis
point to 8.14 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.04, or 0.04, per 100 rupee face amount to 97.80.  Banks have to invest 25 percent of their deposits in low-
risk debt, including government bonds, approved by the central
bank.  The  Reserve Bank  may increase the repurchase auction rate,
at which it lends to banks, for the sixth time this year, 14 of
20 economists said in a Bloomberg News survey before the policy
review on Nov. 2.  India bought back 21.5 billion rupees of bonds maturing
this year and next at an auction on Oct. 25 after offering to
purchase as much as 120 billion rupees of existing debt, the
central bank said.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, fell seven basis points to 6.75
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
