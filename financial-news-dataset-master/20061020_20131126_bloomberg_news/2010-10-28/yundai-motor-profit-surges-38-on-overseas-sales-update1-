Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s
 largest automaker , posted a 38 percent increase in third-quarter
profit as new models attracted buyers in overseas markets,
offsetting the negative impact from a stronger won.  Net income rose to 1.35 trillion won ($1.2 billion) in the
three months ended Sept. 30 from 979.15 billion won a year
earlier, the Seoul-based carmaker said in a statement today.
Analysts expected a 1.23 trillion won profit, according to the
average of 16  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg this month.  Hyundai may post record car sales this year after luring
buyers with its revamped Sonata sedans and Tucson sport-utility
vehicles. The company has benefited from a surge in the yen that
hampered Japanese rivals Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.
in  markets  where they compete, helping offset a rise in the won
that reduces the South Korean carmaker’s earnings from overseas.  “The strengthening won against the dollar is negative,”
Kim Do Joon, who helps manage $8.9 billion worth of assets at
Hanwha Investment Trust Management Co. in Seoul, said before the
earnings announcement. “Still, as the yen’s appreciation is
steeper, Hyundai is expected to keep its competitive edge over
Japanese rivals for a while.”  Hyundai fell 0.3 percent to 170,500 won as of 2:06 p.m. in
Seoul trading, while the benchmark Kospi Index declined 0.2
percent.  The South Korean currency appreciated about 2.6 percent
against the dollar in the first nine months of this year, while
the yen strengthened about 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
