(Corrects spelling of “Stores” in first paragraph.)  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it is
“exploring a variety of options” relating to the ownership
structure of Massmart Holdings Ltd., which it is considering
buying.  The U.S. retailer has “several different models of
successful international ownership designed to maximize
shareholder value,” it said in an e-mailed statement today.
“This includes 100 percent ownership of operations in markets
such as the U.K., and 68 percent ownership of Walmart de
Mexico.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
