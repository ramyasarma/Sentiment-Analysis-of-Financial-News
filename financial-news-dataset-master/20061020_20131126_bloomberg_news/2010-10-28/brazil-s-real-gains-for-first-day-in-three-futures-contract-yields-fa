Brazil’s real gained for the first
time in three days as the dollar weakened globally on
speculation the Federal Reserve will debase the U.S. currency by
buying government debt.  The real rose 0.51 percent to 1.7126 to the dollar at 12:51
p.m. in Sao Paulo (10:51 a.m New York).  Yields fell for the long-term interest-rate futures
contracts, following the decline in U.S. treasury yields. The
January 2017 yield fell 5 basis points to 11.79 percent.  “The longer term contracts are being helped by the fall in
Treasuries yields”, said  Roberto Padovani , chief economist at
Banco WestLB in Sao Paulo.  Yields on interest rate future rose in short-term contracts
were little changed after the central bank said future policy
will depend on whether the next president to be elected this
weekend will curb spending growth. The contract due in January
2012, the most traded on the Sao Paulo futures exchange, was
unchanged at 11.36 percent.  “The central bank says inflation will converge to the
target, if the next government is more fiscally conservative,”
said  Silvio Campos Neto , chief economist at Banco Schahin SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
