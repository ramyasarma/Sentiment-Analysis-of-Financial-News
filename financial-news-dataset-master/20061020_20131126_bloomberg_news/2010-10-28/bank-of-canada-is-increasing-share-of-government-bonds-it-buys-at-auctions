The Bank of Canada said it will
increase the share of the bonds its purchases at federal
government auctions to 15 percent, to improve the management of
its balance sheet.  “This will assist in bringing its holdings of Government
of Canada securities more in line with the composition of the
government’s stock of nominal domestic marketable debt,
consistent with the Bank of Canada’s policy for managing its
balance sheet,” the statement posted on the central bank’s
website said. The move has no impact on monetary policy, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
