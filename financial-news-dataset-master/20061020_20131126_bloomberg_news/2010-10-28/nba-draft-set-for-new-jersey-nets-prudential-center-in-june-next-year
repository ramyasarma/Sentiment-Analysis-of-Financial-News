draft will be held on June 23 at the New Jersey Nets’ home
court, Commissioner  David Stern  said.  “The Prudential Center is a state-of-the-art, multipurpose
arena that will be a great host,” Stern said last night before
the Nets’ season opener against the Detroit Pistons in Newark.  It’s the second time the draft will be held in New Jersey.
Madison Square Garden’s Theater, which has hosted the draft for
the past several years, is unavailable next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
