Vale SA , the world’s biggest iron-
ore producer, said it will almost double investments next year
as it expands production of the steelmaking ingredient and
boosts its nickel, copper and fertilizer businesses.  Rio de Janeiro-based Vale will invest $24 billion in 2011
after spending $10.7 billion in the year through Sept. 30,
according to a statement sent today by the company. Vale said
that it expects to boost its minerals and metals production by
16 percent annually between 2011 and 2015, compared with a rate
of 9.8 percent from 2003 to 2008.  Vale is expanding capacity at Carajas, the world’s largest
iron-ore mine, and may surpass OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel as the
world’s largest nickel producer next year, Chief Executive
Officer  Roger Agnelli  said Oct. 20. The company  said late
yesterday  that its third-quarter profit more than tripled to a
record $6.04 billion, thanks to an increase in prices for the
steelmaking raw material and growing demand from Asia.  “While iron ore and nickel will remain as our largest
operations, our investments will entail a significant expansion
of fertilizers, copper and coal,” Vale said today.  The company’s $24 billion investment plan for next year is
focused on “organic” growth and doesn’t include any
acquisitions, Chief Financial Officer  Guilherme Cavalcanti  said
today during a conference call with analysts. Vale may consider
buying assets if “opportunities” come up, he said.  Output Targets  Vale aims to increase production of iron ore to 522 million
metric tons by 2015, up 68 percent from 2011’s projected 311
million tons, according to a regulatory filing. Nickel output
will rise 29 percent to 381,000 tons, while copper will more
than double to 691,000 tons and potassium is forecast to rise
fourfold to 3.4 million tons by 2015, Vale said.  “The company should continue to deliver ‘peak’ results
over the next 2-3 years,” Barclays Capital analysts led by
 Leonardo Correa  said in an e-mailed note to clients today. The
market is expected to remain “undersupplied,” he said.  Vale  fell 43 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to 48.29 reais at
12:35 p.m. New York time in Sao Paulo trading. The stock rose 23
percent in the year through yesterday, more than the 12 percent
gain for Brazil’s benchmark  Bovespa  index.  Profit  Third-quarter profit climbed to $6.04 billion, or $1.13 a
share, from $1.68 billion, or 31 cents, in the year-ago period,
Vale said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The company was
expected to post per-share profit of $1.03 on an adjusted basis,
according to the average of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
The results, based on U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, topped a previous record of $5.01 billion in the
second quarter of 2008.  Revenue more than doubled to $14.5 billion in the quarter
from $6.89 billion a year earlier.  Vale and rivals BHP Billiton Ltd. and  Rio Tinto Group  this
year broke with a system of setting iron-ore prices once a year
in favor of quarterly agreements. Prices more than doubled in
the quarter to $128.21 per ton from $57.23 a year earlier, Vale
said. Sales volumes were little changed at 68 million tons,
compared with 66.8 million tons in the year earlier period.  The iron-ore market will likely remain “tight” in the
near future because of a lack of new supply and increasing
demand from China, the world’s largest consumer. The nation is
seeking higher-quality ore grades such as those from Brazil
because it can help reduce energy usage, Vale said.  India’s Outlook  India is a “potential important contributor to medium-term
tightness of the iron ore market,”  Vale  said yesterday. The
country’s urbanization rate is 30 percent compared with China’s
47 percent, its industry is small in relative terms and the
government plans to boost infrastructure spending, Vale said.  China accounts for 46 percent of Vale’s iron-ore and pellet
sales, while Japan takes 10 percent, South Korea buys 4.8
percent and India and other Asian nations receive 3.7 percent.  India, Asia’s third-largest economy, will consume more
steel than previously expected on increased demand from
construction companies and carmakers, according to the nation’s
steel ministry. India, ranked below war-ravaged Ivory Coast and
Sri Lanka for the quality of infrastructure, needs to spend $2.2
trillion by 2030 on transportation, housing and office space in
its cities to accelerate growth, McKinsey & Co. said April 22.  Vale’s Simandou  Vale is planning to start producing iron ore from Guinea’s
Simandou project by the end of 2012. Vale said Oct. 18 that
third-quarter iron-ore output increased 24 percent amid rising
demand. The company produced 82.6 million tons of the
steelmaking raw material in the quarter, the highest since
record output of 85.8 million tons in the third quarter of 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
