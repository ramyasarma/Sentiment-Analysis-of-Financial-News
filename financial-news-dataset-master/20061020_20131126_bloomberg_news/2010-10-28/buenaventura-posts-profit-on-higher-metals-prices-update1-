Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, said third-quarter
profit rose 17 percent as surging metals prices and lower costs
offset slumping gold output.  Net income rose to $174.1 million, or 68 cents a share,
from $148.5 million, or 58 cents, in the year-earlier period,
Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement. Analysts
expected profit of 65 cents a share on an adjusted basis, the
average of three estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Buenaventura sold gold for an average $1,243 an ounce in
the quarter, 28 percent more than a year earlier. Higher prices
offset lower output of gold and zinc, said Paul Rojas, an
analyst at Lima-based investment fund NF&C Inversiones SA, which
owns Buenaventura shares.  “Buenaventura has benefitted from a sky-high gold price,”
Rojas, who doesn’t rate the stock, said by telephone before the
results were released. “Silver and lead production increases
also helped earnings.”  Gold output fell 21 percent to 273,389 ounces, while silver
production rose 3 percent, Buenaventura said. Silver and zinc
prices were up 27 percent and 15 percent, respectively.  Revenue climbed 21 percent to $279.9 million, while
operating costs fell 18 percent to $27.9 million. Exploration
spending rose 10 percent to $7.8 million.  Yanacocha, Cerro Verde  Income from minority interests slid 6 percent to $118.1
million. Minority interests include a 44 percent stake in the
Yanacocha gold mine and a 19 percent stake in Phoenix-based  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc .’s Cerro Verde copper mine.  Output from Yanacocha, Latin America’s largest gold mine,
will fall to about 1.5 million ounces this year from 1.9 million
in 2009, Chief Executive Officer Roque Benavides said Aug. 12.
Yanacocha is 56 percent-controlled by  Newmont Mining Corp .  Buenaventura’s La Zanja mine, which started producing gold
this month, will help boost fourth-quarter net income, Rojas
said.  Gold futures for December rose $19.90, or 1.5 percent, to
$1,342.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, rose 28 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $51.73 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The earnings report was released after regular trading had
ended on North American stock markets. The ADRs have jumped 55
percent this year.  (Buenaventura will hold its quarterly conference call Oct.
