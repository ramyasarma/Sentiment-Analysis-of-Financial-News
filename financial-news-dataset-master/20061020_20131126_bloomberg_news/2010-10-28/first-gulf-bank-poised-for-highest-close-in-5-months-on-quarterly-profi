traded at 16.6 dirhams as of 1:03 p.m. in Abu Dhabi, poised for
the highest close since May 26.  Net income for the quarter was 849 million dirhams ($231
million), topping the median 789.5 million-dirham profit
estimate of eight analysts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
