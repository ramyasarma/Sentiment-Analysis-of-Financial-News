Coffee futures dropped the most in
two weeks on concern that the rally that took prices to a 13-
year high was overdone. Cocoa also fell, while orange juice
gained.  Coffee has surged 45 percent in New York this year on
concern that global supplies will be limited. The commodity will
probably drop as much as 16 percent in coming weeks after an
“exaggerated” rally, according to Terra Futuros, Brazil’s
fourth-biggest coffee brokerage.  “There’s some end-of-the-month profit-taking,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago.  Arabica coffee for December delivery lost 3.7 cents, or
1.8 percent, to settle at $1.966 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at
2 p.m. in New York., the biggest drop since Oct. 11.  The price, up 7.4 percent this month, touched $2.046 on
Oct. 26, the highest level since August 1997.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery
declined $21, or 1.1 percent, to $1,914 a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe. Earlier, the commodity touched $1,975, the highest level
since Oct. 6, 2008.  Arabica coffee is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed
by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly in Asia and parts
of Africa.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell $38, or 1.3
percent, to $2,845 a ton in New York. The commodity, up 1.1
percent this month, has dropped 13 percent this year.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery retreated 45
pounds, or 2.3 percent, to 1,872 pounds ($2,981) a ton.  Exports from Cameroon, the world’s fifth-biggest producer,
climbed 18 percent in September from a year earlier, the Cocoa
and Coffee Interprofessional Board said today.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 4.6 cents,
or 3 percent, to $1.558 a pound in New York. The price has lost
0.7 percent this month, and is up 21 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
