Nexans SA, the world’s biggest maker
of cables, reiterated that it expects full-year sales to be
stable, and that 2010 operating profit will represent 4.5
percent of revenue.  Third-quarter revenue rose 11 percent from a year earlier
to 1.09 billion euros at constant non-ferrous metal prices, the
Paris-based company said in a statement today. That corresponds
to an organic increase of 2.8 percent, Nexans said. At current
metal prices, Nexans third-quarter sales stood at 1.57 billion
euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
