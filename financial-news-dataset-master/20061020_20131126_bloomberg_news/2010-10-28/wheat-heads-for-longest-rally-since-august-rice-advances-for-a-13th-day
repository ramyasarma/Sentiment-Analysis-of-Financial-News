Wheat rose for a fifth day in
Chicago, heading for the longest streak since August, on concern
that dry weather may damage U.S. winter crops. Rice climbed for
a 13th day to the highest price in almost 10 months.  Kansas, the largest U.S. winter-wheat producer, may get
“little to no rain” in the next two weeks, QT Weather said
yesterday in a report. Parts of Kansas and Colorado are
experiencing “moderate”  drought , according to data from the
University of Nebraska in Lincoln.  “Wheat has been supported by dry weather in the U.S.
winter crop-growing areas,”  Toshimitsu Kawanabe , an analyst at
Tokyo-based commodity broker Central Shoji Co., said today. Dry
weather may harm early development of winter wheat, stoking
concern over global supplies amid Russia’s export ban, he said.  Wheat for December delivery gained 12.25 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $7.15 a bushel at 11:19 a.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain touched $7.155, the highest
price since Oct. 13. The most-active contract has surged 49
percent since the end of June after drought destroyed Russian
crops, prompting the country to ban exports.  The U.S.  crop  was rated 47 percent good to excellent in the
week ended Oct. 24, down from 62 percent a year earlier,
according to the Department of Agriculture. Wheat is set for a
6.1 percent gain this month, taking the advance for the most-
active contract to 32 percent this year.  Rice Advances  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 1.8 percent to 220.75 euros ($305.41) a metric ton.  Rough rice for January delivery climbed 4 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $15.21 per 100 pounds in Chicago, extending the
longest winning streak since at least 1989. The grain touched
$15.26, the highest level for the most-active contract since
Jan. 4.  Rice has jumped 57 percent since the end of June, when it
touched the lowest level since October 2006, as flooding that
killed at least 162 people across Southeast Asia ravaged crops
in Thailand and Vietnam, the world’s two biggest exporters.  Potential crop losses in Thailand and floods in central
Vietnam came after harvests in Pakistan were devastated by
flooding earlier this year and Typhoon Megi lashed the
Philippines, the world’s biggest rice buyer, widening the
country’s production deficit.  Typhoons, Floods  The USDA lowered its estimate for global milled rice output
to 452.5 million tons on Oct. 8, 171,000 tons short of forecast
demand. The world production deficit, the first in four years,
may be even wider because typhoons and flooding hit Southeast
Asia days after the USDA released its estimate.  Soybeans for January delivery rose 8.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $12.4475 a bushel after touching $12.45, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Sept. 4, 2008. An
increase today would be the fourth straight.  Prices have has risen 12 percent this month on speculation
that China, the largest consumer of vegetable oils, will
increase oilseed imports to cool food inflation.  Soybean-crushing capacity in China may rise 11 million tons
to more than 95 million tons in the 2010-2011 marketing year
from a year earlier, Grain.gov.cn said yesterday in a report.  Chinese profit margins  on crushing soybeans more than
doubled this year as livestock-feed demand rose, according to
data from Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.  Corn for December delivery rose 5.75 cents, or 1 percent,
to $5.83 a bushel. The grain, also up for a fourth day, has
jumped 43 percent since the end of July after Russia said it
would ban cereal exports following the country’s worst drought
in a half-century.  To contact the reporters on this story:
