Braskem SA , Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals producer, will probably sign a contract with
customers within a year for so-called green propylene it plans
to produce, said  Rui Chammas , an executive at its polymers unit.  Braskem, based in Sao Paulo, said yesterday it will invest
$100 million in production of propylene, which is used to make
polypropylene, a plastic used in food containers, water bottles
and car bumpers. Braskem is making the plastic from sugar cane-
based ethanol, according to an e-mailed statement.  The company plans to complete engineering studies in 2011
and have an output capacity of at least 30,000 metric tons of
propylene a year by the second half of 2013, according to a
regulatory filing.  Braskem may find customers in the automotive, packaging and
electronics industries, Chammas, vice president of the unit,
said today in an interview in Dusseldorf, Germany, declining to
name any companies. Packaging for snacks could be a completely
new application for the material, which reduces carbon dioxide
emissions by about 2.3 tons per produced ton compared with
traditional propylene, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
