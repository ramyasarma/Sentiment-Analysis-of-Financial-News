London Underground and  BT Group Plc 
will start a six-month trial next week offering subway
passengers Wi-Fi service at Charing Cross station.  The service, due to start Nov. 1, will give travelers
wireless access in the station and allow them to connect
devices such as smartphones and  Apple Inc. ’s iPads. Wi-Fi will
be available in the ticket hall area of the station and on the
Northern and Bakerloo line platforms, though not on trains,
London Underground said in a press statement today.  “An ever-growing commuter populous has been clamoring to
be able to check their e-mails and browse the Internet whilst
on the go,” Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London’s transport
adviser, said in the statement. “This trial will allow them to
do just that.”  The service, which will include live London travel
updates, will be free for some BT customers and will also be
accessible to users of other networks. The trial service is
being funded by BT and won’t draw on London Underground funds.  BT, the U.K.’s largest fixed-line phone company, may
expand the service, depending on the results of the trial and
further discussions with London Underground, Marjorie Leonidas,
head of wholesale and international roaming at BT OpenZone,
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
