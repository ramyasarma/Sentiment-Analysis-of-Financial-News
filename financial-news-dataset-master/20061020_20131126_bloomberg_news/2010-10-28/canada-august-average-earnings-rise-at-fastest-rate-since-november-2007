Average weekly earnings of non-farm
payroll employees rose in August at the fastest annual pace
since November 2007, led by mining, forestry and manufacturing.  Earnings rose 4.4 percent in August from the same month a
year ago, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Mining and oil
and gas extraction earnings jumped 17 percent, while the average
pay of forestry and workers gained 10 percent and manufacturing
earnings rose 6.5 percent. Administrative and support workers
pay also rose 10 percent from a year ago.  Average earnings have posted annual gains greater than 3
percent for five straight months, exceeding the Bank of Canada’s
1 percent to 3 percent target range for inflation. Earnings
growth was slower than 2 percent for most of last year,
Statistics Canada said.  Non-farm payrolls increased 1.7 percent in August from the
year-earlier month to 14.72 million, and the average hours
worked per week was unchanged at 32.9 hours.  On a monthly basis, total hours worked fell 0.2 percent,
while earnings rose 0.9 percent and payrolls gained 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
