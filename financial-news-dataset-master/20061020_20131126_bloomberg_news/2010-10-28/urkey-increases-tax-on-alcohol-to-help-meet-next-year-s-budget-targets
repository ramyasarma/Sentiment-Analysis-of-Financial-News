consumption tax it applies to alcoholic drinks.  The flat charge on a liter of beer rose 26 percent to 44
kurus (31 cents), the levy on a liter of wine increased 25
percent to 2.44 liras and the tax on national drink raki
advanced 30 percent to 51.48 liras, according to a directive
published in the Official Gazette in Ankara today.  The government aims to raise 61.1 billion liras from the
special consumption tax in 2011, compared to 41.3 billion liras
from the tax in the first nine months of this year. Forecast
income tax receipts in 2011 are 47.3 billion liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
