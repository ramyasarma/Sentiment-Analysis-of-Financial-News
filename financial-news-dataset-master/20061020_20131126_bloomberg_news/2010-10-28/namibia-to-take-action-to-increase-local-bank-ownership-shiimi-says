Namibia plans to take action to
increase local ownership of banks, Ipumbu Shiimi, the country’s
central bank governor, said in an address in the capital,
Windhoek, today.  “We will use a consultative approach to come up with an
acceptable blend” of foreign and local ownership, he said.  Amendments to the country’s Banking Institutions Act give
the minister of finance the power to transform the banking
industry, he said.  “Local ownership and management control is a necessary
factor in enhancing credit extension as local persons know the
domestic conditions,” he said.  Banks active in Namibia include South African-controlled
FNB Namibia Holdings Ltd. and a unit of South Africa’s Standard
Bank Group Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
