MAN SE , Europe’s third-largest
truckmaker, reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates because of growth in its home region and Brazil. The
stock fell as much as 3.4 percent as order growth slowed.  Net income  jumped to 179 million euros ($247 million) from
4 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company said
today in a  statement . Analysts predicted profit of 167 million
euros, according to the average of nine  estimates . Sales
advanced to 3.76 billion euros, also beating estimates.  Revenue in 2010 may exceed last year’s 12 billion euros by
more than 20 percent and the full-year operating margin will
about match the nine-month return on sales of 6.9 percent,
compared with 4.2 percent in 2009, MAN said today. Orders in the
quarter increased 40 percent, slower than the nine-month growth
of 52 percent.  “The report didn’t include that special element of a
positive surprise, and that may have disappointed investors,”
said  Daniel Schwarz , a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG
who  recommends  holding the stock. A decline in third-quarter
orders from second-quarter figures “may also be weighing on the
stock.”  MAN  fell  as much as 2.72 euros to 78.38 euros, the  biggest
drop  since Oct. 8, and was down 2.5 percent as of 11:11 a.m. in
Frankfurt trading. That pared the stock’s gain this year to 45
percent, valuing the company at 11.4 billion euros.  Orders Rise  Third-quarter orders increased to 3.72 billion euros, with
2.86 billion euros generated at the truck division, MAN said.
That compares with 3.75 billion euros in group sales contracts
in the  second quarter . Orders in power engineering, a new unit
combining MAN’s diesel-engine, turbine and RENK industrial-
equipment divisions, dropped 12 percent to 884 million euros.
Nine-month group orders jumped to 11 billion euros.  The manufacturer said it expects a “positive performance”
in the remainder of 2010, with orders and operating profit at
the truck division set to improve in the current three-month
period and following quarters. Fourth-quarter orders at the
power-engineering unit may match year-earlier figures, MAN said,
without specifying any numbers.  European heavy-truck registrations rose 20 percent in
September, the fourth consecutive monthly gain, as demand for
cargo transport picked up, according to the  European Association
of Automobile Manufacturers . Swedish competitor  Volvo AB  posted
third-quarter profit of 2.81 billion kronor ($417 million),
beating analysts’ estimates, while Scania AB reported an
eightfold gain in net income to 2.31 billion kronor.  Truck-Market ‘Recovery’  “MAN is benefitting from a sustained recovery in truck
markets, especially in Germany and Latin America,” said  Arndt Ellinghorst , a London-based analyst with Credit Suisse, who has
an “outperform”  recommendation  on the company’s stock.  The German truckmaker aims to expand to other Latin
American  markets  from a new manufacturing base in Brazil, where
it will introduce a model under the MAN brand in December. The
company bought  Volkswagen AG ’s Brazilian truckmaking operations
in March 2009.  MAN’s deliveries will rise to a record 115,000 to 120,000
trucks this year, Chief Executive Officer  Georg Pachta-Reyhofen 
said Sept. 21. That compares with 40,535 vehicles sold last
year, when deliveries dropped 58 percent. Sales in Brazil may
jump by 50 percent to 60,000 trucks, he said.  The company is 29.9 percent  owned  by Volkswagen, Europe’s
 biggest carmaker . VW, which bought the MAN stake to help  Scania 
fend off the German truckmaker’s hostile bid three years ago,
took a controlling stake in the Swedish company in 2008. The
three companies are now pursuing steps to cooperate on
technology and components sharing. VW’s former production chief,
 Jochem Heizmann , is now overseeing the company’s truck holdings.  “Cooperation talks are progressing really well,” Chief
Financial Officer  Frank Lutz  said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “We’re also pooling our purchasing
activities where we can.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
