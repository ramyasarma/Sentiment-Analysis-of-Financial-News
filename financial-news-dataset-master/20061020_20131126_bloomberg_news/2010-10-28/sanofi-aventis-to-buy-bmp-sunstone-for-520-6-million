Sanofi-Aventis SA  agreed to buy BMP
Sunstone Corp., the maker of the Hao Wa Wa brand of children’s
cough and cold treatments, for $520.6 million in cash to expand
in Chinese consumer health-care products.  BMP Sunstone stockholders will receive $10 a share, about
30 percent more than yesterday’s closing price on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, Paris-based Sanofi said in a statement today. BMP
Sunstone’s board approved the sale, and shareholders who own 23
percent of the Beijing-based company’s stock agreed to support
the deal, Sanofi said.  China’s $16.7 billion consumer health-care market is the
world’s second-largest after the U.S. and has grown 11 percent
annually in the past five years, Sanofi said. The company is
expanding in emerging markets and consumer products to replace
revenue it’s losing as patents expire on some of its best-
selling pharmaceuticals.  Sanofi has made a hostile, $18.5 billion bid for  Genzyme
Corp. , a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based drugmaker. In March,
Sanofi paid $1.9 billion for Chattem Inc., the consumer-health
company that makes Gold Bond powders.  Hao Wa Wa, which means Good Baby, is China’s top pediatric
cold brand, Sanofi said. BMP Sunstone also makes Kang Fu Te
brand hygiene products for women, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
