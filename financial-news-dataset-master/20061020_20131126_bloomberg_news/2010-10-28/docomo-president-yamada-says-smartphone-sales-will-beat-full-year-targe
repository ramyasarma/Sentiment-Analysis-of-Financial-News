NTT DoCoMo Inc. , Japan’s largest
mobile-phone operator, may beat its full-year smartphone sales
target by as much as 30 percent, helped by models running  Google
Inc. ’s Android software, President  Ryuji Yamada  said.  The carrier sold about 600,000 smartphones in the six
months ended Sept. 30, Yamada said at an event in Tokyo to
introduce Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy phone. The Tokyo-
based company previously forecast sales of smartphones will
reach 1 million units in the year ending March 31.  DoCoMo,  KDDI Corp. , Japan’s second-largest carrier, and
 Softbank Corp. , the country’s exclusive provider of  Apple Inc. ’s
iPhone, are expanding their smartphone lines with Android models
to meet demand for data communications and offset falling
revenue from voice services. The iPhone dominates the smartphone
market in Japan with a 60 percent share, according to Tokyo-
based MM Research Institute Ltd.  DoCoMo , which is scheduled to report second-quarter
earnings results today, rose 1 percent to 135,900 yen as of
10:40 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average lost 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
