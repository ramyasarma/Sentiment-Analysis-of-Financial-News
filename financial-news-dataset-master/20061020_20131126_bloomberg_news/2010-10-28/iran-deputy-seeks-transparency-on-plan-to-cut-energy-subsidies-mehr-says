A member of Iran’s Parliament has
criticized the government for its lack of transparency in
implementing a plan to cut energy and food subsidies and direct
part of the cash to poorest Iranians,  Mehr  reported.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s government needs to “clarify
ambiguities before taking any step,” Gholamreza Mesbahi-
Moghadam, a member of the parliament’s economic committee said
yesterday, according to the state-run news agency.  Iran plans to eliminate subsidies on fuel, electricity and
basic consumer goods over the course of five years. The
government says it will compensate for the plan’s inflationary
repercussions by paying grants to low-income families. It hasn’t
however specified when caps will be lifted or by how much prices
will rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
