SEB AB, the second-largest bank in
the Baltic countries, said it posted an operating profit at its
Baltic operations for the first time in two years after credit
losses in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania declined.  “The economic turnaround in the region is more visible
today than it was in the spring,” Chief Executive Officer
Annika Falkengren said in a statement today. “Non-performing
loan volumes continued to drop in all three Baltic countries. As
a result, we have released some collective provisions in both
Latvia and Lithuania in this quarter,” Falkengren said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
