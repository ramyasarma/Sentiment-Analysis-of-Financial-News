The U.S. Federal Communications
Commission’s Enforcement Bureau said it reached a consent decree
with Verizon Wireless, including a record $25 million payment to
the U.S. Treasury, regarding “mystery fees” the company
charged its customers over the last several years.  The payment is the largest in FCC history and the
settlement concludes the agency’s ten-month investigation into
these overcharges. The information was released in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
