Barrick Gold Corp. , the world’s
largest miner of the metal, posted third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates after output at the Cortez Hills
project raised overall production above forecasts.  Net income  was $837 million, or 84 cents a share on a
diluted basis, compared with a loss of $5.35 billion, or $6.07,
a year earlier, Toronto-based Barrick said today in a statement.
Earnings a year ago included a $5.69 billion charge to eliminate
fixed-price gold contracts.  Profit adjusted for losses on derivatives and foreign
exchange was 84 cents a share, topping the 76-cent  average
estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales gained 36
percent to $2.78 billion from $2.04 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Aaron Regent  plans to boost annual
output to 9 million ounces in the next five years. Barrick’s
production rose 8.2 percent to 2.06 million ounces in the
quarter, exceeding its forecast, following a “strong
performance” from North American assets, it said.  Production will rise to 7.65 million to 7.85 million ounces
this year, from 7.4 million ounces in 2009, helped by new
production from Cortez Hills mine in Nevada, Barrick said.  Barrick climbed C$1.13 cents, or 2.4 percent, to C$48.07 at
of 4 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  have
risen 16 percent this year.  Gold for immediate delivery in London traded at a record
$1,387 an ounce on Oct. 14. It averaged $1,228 an ounce in the
quarter, 28 percent higher than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
