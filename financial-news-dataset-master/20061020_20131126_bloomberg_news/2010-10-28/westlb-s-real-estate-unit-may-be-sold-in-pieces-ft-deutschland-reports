WestLB AG  may sell its Westimmo
property unit in bits if the European Union won’t extend the
end-of-the-year deadline for a disposal,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported today, without saying where it got the
information.  Germany’s federal government will support WestLB and ask
the EU for an extension of the deadline, the FTD said, citing
people close to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
