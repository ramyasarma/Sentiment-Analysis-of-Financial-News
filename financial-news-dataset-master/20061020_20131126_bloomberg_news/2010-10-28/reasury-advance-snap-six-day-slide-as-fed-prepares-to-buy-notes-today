Treasuries rose as the Federal
Reserve prepared to buy government debt today as part of its
plan to keep borrowing costs low.  Ten-year notes snapped their longest slide in two years
before a U.S. report that economists said will show initial
claims for jobless benefits increased. The Treasury is scheduled
to sell $29 billion of seven-year debt today, the last of four
note auctions this week.  “The market’s going to rally again,” said  Tomohisa Fujiki ,
an interest-rate strategist in Tokyo at BNP Paribas SA, one of
the 18 primary dealers required to bid at Treasury debt sales.
“The recovery will be slow.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note fell two basis
points to 2.70 percent as of 10:10 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent security due in August
2020 gained 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 11/32.  Two-year rates were 0.41 percent, after dropping to a
record 0.327 percent on Oct. 12.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
