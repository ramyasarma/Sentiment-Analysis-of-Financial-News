European stocks climbed, rebounding
from the biggest selloff in five weeks, as companies from Eni
SpA to Dassault Systemes SA posted results that exceeded
analysts’  estimates .  Eni, Europe’s fourth-largest oil company, climbed 2.8
percent in Milan. Dassault Systemes surged 7.7 percent as the
software maker also raised its profit outlook. France Telecom SA
gained 3.1 percent after saying earnings increased more than
analysts predicted.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  climbed 0.4 percent to 265.9 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, paring yesterday’s 0.8 percent
slump. The measure has gained 2.4 percent so far this month as
companies from Nokia Oyj to Fiat SpA posted results that topped
forecasts and investors speculated the Federal Reserve will
unveil another round of bond purchases at its November meeting
next week as it seeks to shore up the economy.  “The market likes the fact that some bellwether companies
have reported results that are in line or better, so that is a
positive,” said  Ioan Smith , a director at Knight Capital Europe
in London. “I am generally cautious though. There are a lot of
potential road blocks still out there, starting with the Fed
meeting which will be key.”  Asset Purchases  The Fed has asked bond dealers and investors for
projections of central bank asset purchases over the next six
months, along with the likely effect on yields, as it seeks to
gauge the possible impact of new efforts to spur growth.  The New York Fed survey, obtained by Bloomberg News, asks
about expectations for the initial size of any new program of
debt purchases and the time over which it would be completed. It
also asks firms how often they anticipate the Fed will re-
evaluate the program, and to estimate its ultimate size.  National benchmark indexes rose in 12 of the 17 western
European markets that are open today. Greece is closed for a
public holiday. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100  gained 0.6 percent, France’s
CAC 40 increased 0.5 percent and Germany’s DAX increased 0.4
percent.  Stocks extended gains after U.S. data showed an unexpected
drop in U.S. unemployment benefits last week to the lowest level
in three months. A separate report showed European confidence in
the economic outlook improved more than forecast in October, led
by a jump in sentiment among manufacturers.  Beaten Estimates  Of the 127 companies in the  Stoxx 600  to have announced
results since Oct. 7, 72 percent have beaten  analyst estimates 
for per-share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In the U.S., 82 percent of companies on the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index have topped predictions in the period.  Eni  rallied 2.8 percent to 16.15 euros after reporting a 48
percent jump in adjusted net income to 1.70 billion euros ($2.4
billion) as crude prices climbed. That surpassed the 1.34
billion-euro average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. [bn:WBTKR=DSY:FP]   Dassault [] jumped 7.7 percent to 55.88 euros after reporting
a 44 percent rise in third-quarter net income to 55.4 million
euros as the company won new customers for its design software.
The company raised its full-year revenue guidance.  France Telecom rallied 3.1 percent to 17.20 euros after the
company posted a 1.9 percent rise in earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter to
4.26 billion euros, driven by its expansion into Africa and the
Middle East. Analysts had  predicted  Ebitda of 4.14 billion
euros, according to the average of nine estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 4 percent.  Telenet, AstraZeneca  Telenet Group Holding NV jumped 7.9 percent to 28.70 euros.
The cable operator said it will generate more than 225 million
euros of cash not required for reinvestment this year, up from a
previous prediction of more than 200 million euros. Telenet also
said it will add to borrowings to accommodate future shareholder
payouts.  AstraZeneca Plc  lost 3.3 percent to 3,139.5 pence after the
U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker said third-quarter profit fell
27 percent to $1.55 billion, citing generic competition in the
U.S. for three key medicines and no demand for swine flu
vaccine.  ABB Ltd.  slipped 4.1 percent to 20.68 Swiss francs, even
after the world’s largest maker of power-transmission gear
posted better-than-estimated profit of $774 million. The company
said increased spending by customers on industrial equipment
will support earnings and sales into 2011.  Swedbank AB  tumbled 3.8 percent to 93.2 kronor after the
Swedish Export Credit Corporation sold all of its 38.3 million
shares in the lender for 3.5 billion kronor.  SSAB Svenskt Staal AB sank 7.6 percent to 97.05 kronor, the
biggest decliner on the Stoxx 600. Sweden’s largest steelmaker
reported third-quarter net income of 165 million kronor compared
with a net loss of 753 million kronor a year earlier. Analysts
had estimated profit of 252 million kronor, according to a
survey compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
