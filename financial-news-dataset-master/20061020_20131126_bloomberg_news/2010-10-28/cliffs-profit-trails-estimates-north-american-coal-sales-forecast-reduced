Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. , North
America’s largest iron-ore producer, posted third-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates and cut its full-year coal sales
forecast for the region.  Net income  rose fivefold to $297.4 million, or $2.18 a
share, from $58.8 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier, the
Cleveland-based company said today in a statement. That trailed
the $2.62 average of six  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  Sales  doubled to $1.35 billion from $666.4 million, missing
the $1.45 billion average of six analysts in the survey.  Cliffs reduced its North American coal production
projection to 3.6 million tons from 3.9 million tons because of
“adverse geological conditions” at some mines.  The company maintained its 2010 North American iron-ore
forecast at about 27 million tons and raised its Asia-Pacific
iron ore outlook to 9 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
