Thomson Reuters Corp. , the financial
news and information provider, reported third-quarter profit
rose 66 percent, helped by increasing sales of tax and
accounting products.  Net income rose to $277 million, or 32 cents a share, from
$167 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
rose to 49 cents a share from 43 cents. Analysts projected 45
cents, the average of 13  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue  declined about 2 percent at the sales and trading
and investment and advisory units, which together account for
almost half of the total. In the tax and accounting and
enterprise divisions, sales advanced 8 percent and 7 percent,
respectively.  Total sales rose 1.2 percent to $3.26 billion, compared
with the $3.19 billion average analyst estimate.  Thomson Reuters fell 55 cents to C$38.84 at 4:14 p.m. in
Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The shares have advanced 14
percent this year.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Thomson Reuters in selling financial and legal information and
trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
