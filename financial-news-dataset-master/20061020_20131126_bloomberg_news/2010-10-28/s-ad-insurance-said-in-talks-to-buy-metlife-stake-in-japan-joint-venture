MS&AD  Insurance Group Holdings Inc.,
Japan’s biggest casualty insurer, is in talks to buy MetLife
Inc.’s stake in their insurance joint venture, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the matter.  MS&AD plans to buy the 49 percent stake of the annuity
insurance venture, Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Co., held
by the U.S. insurer, effectively dissolving its partnership
with MetLife, the person said, declining to be identified
because the information is private. The joint venture had 3.1
trillion yen ($38 billion) in assets at the end of March and
earned premium income of 443.6 billion yen last fiscal year,
according to the firm.  The end of the partnership comes after MetLife, the
biggest U.S. life insurer, agreed in March to buy American Life
Insurance Co., a non-U.S. unit of  American International Group
Inc.  known as Alico, for about $15.5 billion. That deal, set to
be completed in November, will give New York-based MetLife an
additional 12,500 employees and 20 million customers in Japan.  The Yomiuri newspaper reported earlier today that the two
companies would dissolve their partnership. MS&AD said in a
statement nothing has been decided.  Hideto Sakamoto, a spokesman at Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife
Insurance, declined to comment.  John Calagna , a spokesman for
the New York-based insurer, could not be reached for comments
outside of normal business hours.  To contact the reporters on this story:
