Nissan Motor Co ., Japan’s third-
largest automaker, said it’s recalling about 2.2 million cars
and light trucks globally to fix an ignition defect that can
cause an engine to stall.  The recall includes 770,000 vehicles in North America, the
company said today in a statement. In the U.S. and Canada, it
includes 2004 through 2006 model Armada and Infiniti QX 56
sport-utility vehicles and Titan pickup trucks, as well as 2005
to 2006 model Frontier pickups and Pathfinder and Xterra SUVs.  Automakers are enhancing scrutiny of defects after  Toyota
Motor Corp . recalled more than 10 million vehicles in the past
year. This month, Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, and
 Honda Motor Co.  recalled about 2 million vehicles to fix a flaw
linked to brake-fluid leaks.  In Japan, Nissan will repair nine models, including the
March, Note and Tiida compact cars, recalling a total 834,759
vehicles, according to a statement on the website of the
nation’s transport ministry. There have been no accidents and
injuries related to the problem, Nissan said.  Shares of Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan rose 2 yen to 732
yen in Tokyo trading. The stock has fallen 9.6 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
