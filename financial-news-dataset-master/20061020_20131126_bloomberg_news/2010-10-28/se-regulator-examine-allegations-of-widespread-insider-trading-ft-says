The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the
Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission are
investigating allegations of widespread insider trading, the
Financial Times reported.  The TSE and SESC are examining possible insider trading
where short-selling activity increased substantially before
announcements of new share sales, the FT said, citing officials
at both organizations.  The report cited share-price declines in Nippon Sheet Glass
Co. and Tokyo Electric Power Co. before the announcement of
stock issues, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
