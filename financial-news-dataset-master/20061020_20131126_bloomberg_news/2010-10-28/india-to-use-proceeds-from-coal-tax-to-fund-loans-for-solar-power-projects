The Indian government is considering
using revenue from a coal tax for a fund designed to minimize to
the risk of financing solar projects and convince private banks
to lend to the sector.  “It’s a risk mitigation fund,” in the range of a few
billion rupees, said Debashish Majumdar, managing director of
the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. The state-
run lender is advising the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
on the proposal.  The fund will seek to partially protect solar projects from
any late payments or defaults by state distribution companies
that are expected to buy their power under a government project
aiming to boost India’s solar capacity, Majumdar said in an
interview in Noida today outside the capital of New Delhi.  Part of the money raised from a new tax on coal producers
may go toward the fund, he said. India imposed a coal levy in
July, which is expected to raise 25 billion rupees ($406
million) in the financial year ending March 30, according to
Environment Minister  Jairam Ramesh .  India aims to have 1,000 megawatts of solar capacity
connected to the electricity grid by 2013 and 20,000 megawatts
by 2022 from just 10 megawatts now by offering financial
incentives such as special tariffs.  Commercial banks say they are reluctant to lend to project
developers seeking to take advantage of the solar incentives
because of unfamiliarity with the new sector, Majumdar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
