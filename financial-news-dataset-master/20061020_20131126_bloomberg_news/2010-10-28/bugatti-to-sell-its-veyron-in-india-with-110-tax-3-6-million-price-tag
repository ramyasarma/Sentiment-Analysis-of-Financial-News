Volkswagen AG ’s Bugatti introduced
the Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport car in India, undeterred by a 110
percent import tax that helps raise the retail price to about
160 million rupees ($3.6 million).  The company will deliver the supercars, which are able to
reach speeds of 407 kph (253 mph), six to eight months after
receiving orders, Guy Caquelin, Bugatti’s marketing manager for
the Middle East, Europe and India told reporters in New Delhi
today. He didn’t give a sales forecast.  Bugatti follows  Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.  and Tata Motors
Ltd.’s Jaguar Land Rover in beginning sales in India as growth
boosts the number of millionaires in Asia’s third-biggest
economy. The Indian market for luxury products including
watches, clothes and cars may triple to $14.7 billion by 2015,
A.T. Kearney Ltd. and the Confederation of Indian Industry said
in a report this month.  “People have more spending power and are getting more
aware of owning beautiful things,” said Satya Bagla, head of
Exclusive Motors Pvt., the dealer for Bugatti, Lamborghini and
Bentley. “They are more ready to show their wealth.”  Ferrari SpA, the maker of the $228,000 California supercar,
plans to start selling in India next year, Chairman Luca Cordero
di Montezemolo said on Sept. 30.  The convertible Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport features carbon-
fiber body parts, backstitched leather seats and a reversing
camera integrated into the rear-view mirror.  The combined net worth of India’s 100 wealthiest people
climbed to a record $300 billion this year, equivalent to a
quarter of India’s gross domestic product, according to Forbes.
India’s wealthy may almost double their assets to $6.4 trillion
over the next five years as economic growth swells their ranks,
Credit Suisse Group AG said in its global wealth report released
Oct. 8.  Tata has re-opened sales of the Nano, the world’s cheapest
car, this year after halting orders following an initial surge
in demand. The vehicle costs from 131,331 rupees.  The World Bank estimates 76 percent of India’s population
survives on less than $2 a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
