Palestinian Authority President
 Mahmoud Abbas  said that while resuming direct negotiations with
Israel is the preferred option of the Palestinian leadership, it
has alternatives if the U.S.-backed talks aren’t resumed.  “We are ready to go back to the negotiations as soon as
Israel stops settlement activities,” Abbas said at a press
conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah broadcast on state-
run Palestinian television after he met today with visiting
Egyptian Foreign Minister  Ahmed Aboul Gheit  and intelligence
chief  Omar Suleiman .  Abbas didn’t give details of the alternatives to talks.
Palestinian leaders say they may ask the United Nations to
recognize a Palestinian state, over Israel’s objections, if
peace talks fail.  The negotiations, which began Sept. 2, stalled after the
Netanyahu government’s 10-month partial moratorium on Jewish
settlement construction in the West Bank ended on Sept. 26.  Palestinians and the Arab League on Oct. 8 gave the U.S.
administration one month to find a formula to renew the talks
that includes the cessation of settlement building, before the
group meets to consider alternatives. Abbas reiterated today
that he won’t return to the negotiations unless the construction
is halted again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
