Brazil’s broadest inflation index
rose 1.01 percent in October from a month earlier, led by a jump
in food prices that pushed the annual rate to its highest level
since December 2008.  The increase in consumer, construction and wholesale
prices, as measured through Oct. 20 by the IGP-M  price  index,
was down from the 1.15 percent rise in the same period a month
earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas foundation said
on its website. From a year earlier, the index rose 8.81
percent, the highest since 9.81 percent in December 2008.
The monthly and 12-month results were in line with the median
forecasts of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The monthly increase was led by a 4.7 percent rise in food
prices. The cost of industrial products rose 0.19 percent.
Prices rose 1.15 percent in September, according to the.  Wholesale prices, which have a 60 percent weighting in the
IGP-M index, increased 1.3 percent in October, while consumer
prices rose 0.56 percent, compared with 0.34 percent in
September, the report said.  The real gained 0.3 percent to 1.7164 per U.S. dollar at
7:51 a.m. New York time. In the overnight interest-rate futures
market, the yield on the contract due in January 2012, the most
traded on Sao Paulo’s BM&F Exchange, rose 1 basis point to 11.37
percent.  The IGP-M will increase 9.84 percent in 2010, according to
the median forecast in a central bank survey of about 100
economists published Oct. 25.  Consumer price inflation  as measured by the benchmark IPCA
index accelerated to 4.70 percent in the year through September.
The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus
two percentage points.  Policy makers forecast consumer price inflation will slow
to 4.6 percent next year should the benchmark rate remain at its
current level, according to the central bank’s quarterly
inflation report published Sept. 30.  The central bank kept its benchmark Selic rate unchanged at
10.75 percent on Oct. 20, after raising it a total of two
percentage points this year to prevent the economy from
overheating.  Brazilian economists expect the bank to resume interest
rate increases in April and to lift the Selic to 11.75 percent
by June next year, according to the median forecast in the
central bank survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
