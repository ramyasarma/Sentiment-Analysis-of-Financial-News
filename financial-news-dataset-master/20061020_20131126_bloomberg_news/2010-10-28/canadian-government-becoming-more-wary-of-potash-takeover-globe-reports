Canada’s central government is
becoming more skeptical of the proposed takeover of Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc. by  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the Globe and Mail
reported, citing unidentified people.  Industry Minister  Tony Clement  is being swayed by the
arguments of Saskatchewan Premier  Brad Wall  that Potash Corp.
should remain domestically owned, the newspaper said. BHP
officials are concerned the government may ask it to make
“extravagant” concessions as part of the takeover, forcing the
Melbourne-based company to walk away, according to the report.  BHP has “absolute confidence” in the Canadian review of
the offer and is continuing talks with the government, Ruban
Yogarajah, a London-based spokesman for the company, told
Bloomberg News today by phone, responding to the article.  The takeover is being reviewed by Investment Canada, which
can block the bid if it determines the sale doesn’t provide a
“net benefit” to the country, Clement has said.  The deadline for the decision is Nov. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
