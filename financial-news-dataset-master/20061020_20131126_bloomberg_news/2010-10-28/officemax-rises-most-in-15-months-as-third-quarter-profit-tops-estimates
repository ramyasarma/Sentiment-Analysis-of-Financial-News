OfficeMax Inc. , the third-largest
office-supply retailer in the U.S., surged the most in almost 11
months in New York trading after third-quarter profit surpassed
some analysts’ estimates.  Earnings in the quarter ended Sept. 25 more than tripled to
$20 million, or 23 cents a share, from $5.66 million, or 7
cents, a year earlier, the Naperville, Illinois-based company
said in a statement today. Analysts anticipated 12 cents, the
average of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The retailer has increased  profit margins  through store
closings and cost cutting. OfficeMax, which named a new chief
executive officer this month, also is tailoring more products to
women and offering more services and items tied to computers.  “OfficeMax delivered better than expected third quarter
results on the back of significant gross margin expansion,”
 Gary Balter , an analyst for Credit Suisse in New York, wrote in
a note to clients. Balter rates OfficeMax shares “outperform.”  OfficeMax rose $2.25, or 15 percent, to $17.10 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the largest
advance since Dec. 4. The shares have surged 35 percent this
year.  On Oct. 13, OfficeMax said Ravi Saligram will become CEO as
of Nov. 8, replacing Sam Duncan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
