Ukraine’s economy may expand more
than 4 percent this year if the current level of demand for
metals is maintained, said Ihor Shumylo, executive director for
the economic department at the central bank.  The economy expanded an annual 4 percent in the third
quarter, Shumylo told a conference in Kiev today. The economy
grew 5 percent in the first nine months compared with the same
period last year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
