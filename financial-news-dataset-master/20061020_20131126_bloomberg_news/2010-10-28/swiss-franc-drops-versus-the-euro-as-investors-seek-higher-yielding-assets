The franc fell against the euro as
rising stock prices gave investors confidence to seek higher-
yielding alternatives to the Swiss currency elsewhere in Europe.  The franc, which strengthened to a record against the euro
last month, declined against 13 of its 16 most-traded peers
today. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.8
percent, boosted by better-than-expected earnings from companies
including France’s Dassault Systemes SA and Italy’s Eni SpA,
while Switzerland’s key stock index rose to a five-month high.  “Swiss investors have started to reallocate funds out of
Switzerland again very strongly,” said  Manuel Oliveri , a
foreign-exchange strategist at UBS AG in Zurich. “You get more
for your money because of the strong Swiss franc appreciation
over the last few months. This has actually led to some weakness
against the euro.”  The franc depreciated 0.3 percent to 1.3684 per euro at
2:45 p.m. in London. It yesterday reached 1.3703, its weakest
level since Aug. 11. The currency gained 0.4 percent to 98.69
centimes per dollar.  The Swiss franc has climbed 2.9 percent this year against a
basket of currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes. It has declined 1.9 percent in the
past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
