Investors should buy five-year
German government bonds and sell 30-year debt, betting the
difference in yield between the securities will widen on
inflation expectations, Lloyds Banking Group Plc said.  “If the market is correctly pricing the 30-year bond, the
implied inflation profile suggests that the 5-year currently
looks cheap,”  Charles Diebel , head of market strategy, and
fixed-income strategist  David Page , said in a research note
today. “We advocate a 5s-30s steepening trade to capitalize on
this.”  The difference in yield between 5-year and 30-year German
bonds widened one basis  point  to 131 basis points as of 9:04
a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
