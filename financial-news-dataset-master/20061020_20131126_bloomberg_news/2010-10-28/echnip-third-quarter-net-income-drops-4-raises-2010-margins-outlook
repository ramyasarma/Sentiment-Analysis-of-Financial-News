Technip SA , Europe’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, reported third-quarter profit fell 4
percent and raised its 2010 outlook for operating margins.  “New project momentum for the oil and gas services
industry has grown during 2010, even if many projects have
slipped into 2011,” Technip said today in a statement, adding
that “uncertainties in timing persist.”  Technip said  net income  fell to 103 million euros ($142
million), beating the 101.9 million-euro average  average
estimate  in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue fell 12 percent to 1.51
billion euros.  Technip kept a sales forecast of 5.9 billion euros to 6.1
billion euros this year, compared with 6.5 billion euros in
2009, and raised the outlook for operating margins on its subsea
business to around 16.5 percent from more than 15 percent. The
outlook for combined operating margin is “close to” 6 percent
from a previous 5.3 percent.  Technip is counting on oil companies making final
investment decisions on projects at a faster pace this year as
global demand for crude recovered. Oil service providers
suffered last year after clients cut investments because of
tighter credit markets and a drop in crude prices from their
2008 highs.  The order backlog grew to 8.5 billion euros at the end of
the third quarter from 7.54 billion euros a year earlier.  Schlumberger Ltd., the largest oilfield services provider,
said Oct. 22 profit more than doubled as an increase in onshore
drilling in the U.S. and Canada offset a slowdown in the Gulf of
Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
