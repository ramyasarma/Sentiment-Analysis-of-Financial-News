Cenovus Energy Inc. may sell light-
crude-producing fields in southwestern Saskatchewan to boost
investment in its oil-sands properties, Chief Executive Officer
Brian Ferguson said in an interview.  The company will consider “whether we think that there’s
greater value for our shareholders in going to full development
or potentially divesting at some future point,” Ferguson said.
Output from the company’s Shaunavon field in Saskatchewan will
probably reach 2,000 barrels a day by the end of the year, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
