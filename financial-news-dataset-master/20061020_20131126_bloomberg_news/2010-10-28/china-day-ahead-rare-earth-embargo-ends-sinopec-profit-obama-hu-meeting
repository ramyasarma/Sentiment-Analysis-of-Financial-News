China ended its undeclared embargo
of exports of crucial strategic minerals to the U.S., Europe and
Japan, although shipments to Japan still encountered
difficulties, the New York Times reported, citing four
unidentified rare earth industry officials.  Chinese customs officials, without explanation, allowed
shipments to resume to all three destinations, the newspaper
reported, citing the officials, who asked for anonymity because
of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue. Shipments to the U.S.
and Europe had been blocked since Oct. 18 and to Japan since
Sept. 21, the Times said.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. plans to
invest 2 billion yuan to 3 billion yuan over five years to
accumulate reserves of rare-earth metals in 10 locations after a
successful stockpiling trial this year, the Nikkei English News
said, citing people close to the Ministry of Land and Resources.  Sinopec Earnings  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , called Sinopec, said net
income gained 15 percent to 19.6 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in
the third quarter. That surpassed the 18.16 billion yuan average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Sinopec
didn’t report revenue.  Obama-Hu Meeting  President  Barack Obama  and President  Hu Jintao  of China are
scheduled to meet one-on-one Nov. 11 at the Group of 20 summit
amid strains over currency and trade.  The agenda for Obama’s discussion with Hu, their seventh
meeting since Obama became president, is likely to include the
balance of trade between the two countries as well as U.S. and
global concern about the valuation of China’s currency,  Jeff Bader , senior director for Asian Affairs at the National
Security Council, said at a White House briefing.  H.K. Exhausts Yuan Quota  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority activated its swap
agreement with the People’s Bank of China after the city
completely exhausted this year’s quota for yuan-conversion for
trade settlement.  The Authority plans to draw 10 billion yuan through the
arrangement, out of the annual maximum of 200 billion yuan, to
meet demand, Deputy Chief Executive  Arthur Yuen  told reporters
in Hong Kong yesterday. Banks should use long yuan positions or
buy the currency from other banks as needed, he said.  Sanofi-Aventis Buys China Drugmaker  Sanofi-Aventis SA  agreed to buy BMP Sunstone Corp., the
maker of the  Hao Wa Wa  brand of children’s cough and cold
treatments, for $520.6 million in cash to expand in Chinese
consumer health-care products.  BMP Sunstone stockholders will receive $10 a share, about
30 percent more than the Oct. 27 closing price on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, Paris-based Sanofi said in a statement. BMP
Sunstone’s board approved the sale, and shareholders who own 23
percent of the Beijing-based company’s stock agreed to support
the deal, Sanofi said.  IMF Says Yuan Undervalued  Decisions by China and some other Asian emerging economies
to limit currency appreciation is contributing to “significant
exchange-rate misalignments” and to tensions across the Group
of 20, the International Monetary Fund said in a note to finance
officials.  The IMF, which called the yuan “substantially
undervalued” and the dollar “on the strong side of
fundamentals,” urged developing nations with current-account
surpluses to let exchange rate appreciation begin “in
earnest.” At the same time, it said advanced economies must
repair their financial systems and plan to curb budget deficits
in 2011 to help shift the sources of global demand.  Air China, China Eastern  Air China Ltd. and  China Eastern Airlines Corp. , the
world’s largest and third-biggest carriers by  market value ,
reported quarterly profit surges because of a rebound in air-
travel demand and a stronger yuan.  Net income  at Air China jumped more than fivefold to 5.2
billion yuan ($778 million) in the third quarter, the company
said in a stock exchange statement. China Eastern, which also
received a boost from the Shanghai Expo, said profit surged more
than 130-fold to 3.15 billion yuan.  China Life Earnings  China Life Insurance Co. , the nation’s biggest insurer,
said third-quarter profit rose 3.4 percent as a rally in the
nation’s stock market lifted investment returns and premiums
expanded.  Net income  climbed to 6.91 billion yuan ($1.03 billion)
from a restated 6.68 billion yuan, a year earlier, the Beijing-
based company said in a statement to the Shanghai stock exchange.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.24 yuan.  Dongfeng Motor Earnings  Dongfeng Motor Group Co. , the Chinese partner of  Nissan
Motor Co. , almost doubled nine-month profit as economic growth
spurred demand for cars.  Net income  rose to 8.61 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) from
4.63 billion yuan a year earlier, the company said in a Hong
Kong stock exchange statement. Third-quarter profit was little
changed at 2.08 billion yuan, according to figures derived from
the nine-month results.  Pacific Basin Outlook  Pacific Basin Shipping Ltd. , Hong Kong’s largest operator
of dry-bulk vessels, forecast an upswing in demand from next
month through early 2011 as Chinese steelmakers rebuild stocks
of iron ore.  The resumption of Indian trade following monsoons and
increased demand for U.S. grain shipments because of a Russian
export ban will also drive volumes, the shipping line said in a
Hong Kong stock exchange statement.  EU Tariffs  The European Union threatened to extend to Malaysia tariffs
on screws and bolts from China, saying Chinese exporters may
have used the nation to evade the levies and undercut EU
producers.  The  European Commission  opened a probe into whether Chinese
exporters of iron or steel fasteners shipped them to the 27-
nation EU via Malaysia. The EU duties on imports of fasteners
that originate in China are as high as 85 percent in a case that
prompted a complaint by the Chinese government.  MARKETS:  Most U.S. stocks fell as 3M Co. drove industrial shares
