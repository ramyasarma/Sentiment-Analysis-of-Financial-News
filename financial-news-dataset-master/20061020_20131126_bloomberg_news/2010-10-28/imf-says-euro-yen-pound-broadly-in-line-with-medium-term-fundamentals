The dollar is on the “strong side”
relative to U.S. economic performance, the International
Monetary Fund said in a report today to officials from the Group
of 20 nations.  The Washington-based agency also said the euro, yen and
pound “all appear broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals.”  Emerging economies with current-account surpluses need to
begin to allow exchange-rate appreciation “in earnest” to play
their part in rebalancing global demand, the Fund said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
