Raytheon Co. , the world’s largest
missile maker, raised its full-year profit forecast after third-
quarter net income rose 49 percent on improved missile and space
earnings and a one-time tax benefit.  Raytheon, based in Waltham, Massachusetts increased the
upper end of its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents to $5.38
per share, compared with its July estimate of $5.13 to $5.28,
and 2009 profit of $4.85 a share.  The higher forecast “is strictly from productivity and
operational improvements we have taken,” Chief Financial
Officer  David Wajsgras  said in a phone interview today. The
company is passing on the savings to its military customers, he
said.  U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  is pushing to save at
least $100 billion through 2015 from reduced overhead costs both
at the Pentagon and defense contractors. He plans to use some of
those funds for new weapons as the defense budget is projected
to grow about 1 percent a year after inflation.  Raytheon fell $1.66, or 3.5 percent, to $45.64 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange  composite trading . The shares have
declined 11 percent this year.  Raytheon cut administrative costs and reduced reworking
rates that led to profit in its Missile Systems division
increasing by 12 percent to $162 million and Space and Airborne
segment profit gaining 20 percent to $191 million, Wajsgras
said.  Profit Rises  Net income  for the quarter rose to $728 million, or $1.94 a
share, from $490 million, or $1.25, a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. Profit from operations excluding some
items was $1.26 a share. Analysts predicted $1.14, the average
of 19  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  During the quarter Raytheon had a one-time tax benefit of
$170 million, or 45 cents a share.  Full-year sales will be in the range of $25.3 billion to
$25.6 billion, lower than the previous estimate of $25.6 billion
to $26.1 billion, Raytheon said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expected sales of $25.8 billion.  Separately, the company filed today to offer as much as $3
billion of debt, common stock, preferred stock, and warrants,
adding to as much as $2 billion of debt issued after the end of
the third quarter.  At today’s terms, “even somebody that doesn’t like debt has
to look at it,” Chief Executive Officer  Bill Swanson  said on a
conference call, when asked to comment on the new debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
