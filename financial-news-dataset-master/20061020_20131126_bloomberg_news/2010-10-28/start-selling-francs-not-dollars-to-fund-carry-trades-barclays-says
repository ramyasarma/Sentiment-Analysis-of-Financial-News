Investors should stop selling the
dollar against a basket of Turkish lira, Norwegian krona and New
Zealand dollars, and reinstate the trade with the Swiss franc as
the funding currency, according to Barclays Plc.  “The Group of 4 central banks will continue to keep the
global financial system flush with liquidity and provide a good
environment for carry trades,” analysts led by Mathieu Zaradzki 
in London wrote in a research report today. “We also continue
to think that the Norwegian krone, the New Zealand dollar and
the Turkish lira are attractive high yielders. But the valuation
of their dollar crosses is looking stretched and we no longer
prefer the dollar as our funding currency.”  Investors should buy a basket made up 50 percent of the
lira, and 25 percent each of New Zealand dollars and Norwegian
krona, they strategists said. An option to buy the dollar
against the South African rand should be bought as a partial
hedge against the position, they said.  The previous trade earned 3.2 percent since Sept. 23,
Barclays said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
