Dexus Wholesale Property Fund, an
unlisted trust managed by Dexus Property Group, raised A$250
million ($244 million) to repay loans in its first bond sale.  The 7.25 percent notes due in November 2015 were priced to
yield 7.345 percent, or 185 basis points more than the swap
rate, according to an e-mailed statement from Commonwealth Bank
of Australia, which managed the sale with Westpac Banking Corp.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Proceeds will be used to repay a A$250 million bank
facility, Dexus Wholesale said in an e-mailed statement. The
sale is “in line with the fund’s strategy to diversify its
funding sources,” the statement said.  The fund, rated A by Standard & Poor’s, has interests in
retail, office and industrial properties throughout Australia
valued at about A$2.9 billion, according to its website.  Dexus
Property Group  is Australia’s largest owner and manager of
office properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
