Survivors of a tsunami in
Indonesia’s west received tents and other supplies yesterday and
aid workers provided necessities to evacuees from a volcanic
eruption, as the number of dead from the disasters rose.  The death toll from the Oct. 25 tsunami that hit the
Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra reached 394 and
the number of missing fell to 312, Surya, a staff member at the
West Sumatra Regional Disaster Agency, said by phone today.
About 12,900 are displaced, Surya said. Of those, 409 are
injured, 267 severely, he said.  Bread, milk, tents and clothes arrived via ships from
Padang yesterday, and more is on the way from Jakarta, Maria, a
volunteer at the agency’s command post, said by phone yesterday.
A plane loaded with supplies landed in Padang yesterday and will
deliver the goods today, she said.  “We need food, medicines,” Maria, who goes by one name,
said. “Some areas cannot be reached by cars. We’ve been able to
reach those places with whatever it takes; by motorcycles or
some even walking.”  In Central Java, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
Jakarta, Red Cross Indonesia workers treated people who were
burned or otherwise injured after the Mount Merapi volcano
erupted three times Oct. 26, spewing superheated ash.  The death toll rose to 34 with two others missing, and
39,564 people are staying at evacuation centers, the disaster
management agency said on its website yesterday.  More Eruptions  The volcano erupted about 8 a.m. today, Metro TV reported,
without providing further details. A small eruption occurred
yesterday, Surono, an official at the country’s Volcanology and
Geology Disaster Mitigation Center, said by phone. No injuries
were reported.  The 7.5-magnitude temblor struck the Kepulauan Mentawai
region of Indonesia, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) from
Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra, and 640
kilometers from Singapore at 9:42 p.m. local time Oct. 25, the
U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake triggered a 3-meter (10-
foot) tsunami that reached 400 meters inland, the agency said
Oct. 26.  President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  interrupted his
participation in a regional summit in Hanoi to travel to the
disaster zones two days ago. He’ll rejoin the summit today, his
office said.  Indonesia, a country of more than 17,000 islands, is prone
to earthquakes as it forms part the of “Ring of Fire,” an arc
of volcanoes and fault lines surrounding the Pacific Basin.  Fatal Padang Quake  A 7.6-magnitude earthquake in the same area in October 2009
left more than 1,000 people dead in Padang, many of whom were
buried in mudslides and the rubble of collapsed buildings. Less
than a month earlier, a magnitude-7 temblor south of Java on
Sept. 2 left 82 people dead.  A magnitude 7 earthquake carries about as much as energy as
199,000 tons of TNT, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  A tsunami generated by a magnitude-9.1 earthquake off
northern Sumatra in December 2004 left about 220,000 people dead
or missing in 12 countries around the Indian Ocean.  Since the December 2004 quake and tsunami, countries
including Thailand, Malaysia and India have been installing
detection buoys and setting up warning networks.  The system consists of seismological stations and deep-sea
sensors, linked to more than 20 information analysis centers
capable of receiving and distributing tsunami advisories.  Many coastal areas have been equipped with sirens or other
alarms to warn of approaching waves.  Indonesia has had two of the world’s biggest volcanic
eruptions in the past 200 years, Mount Tambora in 1815 and
Krakatau in 1883.  To contact the reporters on this story:
