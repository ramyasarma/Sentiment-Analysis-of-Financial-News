Australia’s commercial property
market is recovering sooner than expected, driven by a strong
economy and the biggest mining boom in more than a century,
 Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  said.  “The demand for office space has exceeded expectations for
this stage of the recovery phase,” Australia Chief Executive
Officer Stephen Conry said in an emailed release. “We will soon
be seeing pressure on rents, enhanced values, and more
developers becoming increasingly confident and active.”  The nation’s economic strength, jobs growth and rising
business confidence will drive rental growth over the next year,
Conry said, as vacancies peak at a low 8.3 percent. That will
fuel an increase in the volume of sales in 2011, he said.  Most Australian real estate trusts reported a return to
profit in the 2010 financial year as they exited overseas
investments and raised capital following a period of surging
debt and plunging property values. Australia’s biggest mining
and energy boom since the 19th century will drive faster-than-
anticipated growth in the Perth and Brisbane markets, Conry said.  Rising retail sales and consumer confidence will support
retail rents as yields stabilize, LaSalle said. Yields are also
falling in some industrial markets as demand for warehousing
space and rental growth emerge, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
