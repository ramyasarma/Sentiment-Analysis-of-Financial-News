Avon Products Inc.,  the world’s
largest door-to-door cosmetics seller, declined the most in six
months after third-quarter sales rose less than expected.  The shares slid $1.85 or 5.6 percent, to $31.01 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest
decline since April 13. Revenue rose 3.8 percent to $2.62
billion, less than the $2.69 billion average of analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue was “softer than we had expected,” Chief
Executive Officer  Andrea Jung  said today in a statement. The
results came after the New York-based maker of makeup and skin
care products spent more to promote and distribute brands,
boosting advertising spending 36 percent to $115 million.  Jung declined to comment during a conference call with
analysts today on a newspaper report that L’Oreal SA is
considering buying Avon. L’Oreal, the world’s largest cosmetics
maker, is considering a bid of $44 a share for Avon, the Daily
Mail reported on Oct. 12. A bid at that price would be worth
about $19 billion, based on Avon’s shares outstanding as of
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
