Lonmin Plc , the world’s third-
largest platinum producer, is being threatened with strike
action by as many as 18,000 workers after wage talks broke down
yesterday, South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers said.  “We are already preparing ground for a strike,” the union
said today in an e-mailed statement, calling on the company to
raise its wage offer to 11 percent from 7 percent.  The dispute will be referred to the Commission for
Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, the NUM said.  Tanya Chikanza , Lonmin’s investor relations chief, declined to comment
today and referred to a Dec. 4 statement in which the company
announced a two-year wage agreement with the NUM.  Lonmin agreed to a 10 percent wage increase in the first
year of the accord, back-dated to Oct. 1, 2009, it said at the
time. In the second year,  employees  would be eligible for an
increase of consumer price inflation plus 2 percent, it said.  Consumer-price  inflation  slowed to an annual 3.2 percent
last month from 3.5 percent in August, according to data from
Statistics South Africa.  Lonmin produces platinum group metals in Marikana, near
Rustenburg in South Africa’s North West Province. Anglo Platinum
Ltd. is the largest producer of the metal, followed by Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
