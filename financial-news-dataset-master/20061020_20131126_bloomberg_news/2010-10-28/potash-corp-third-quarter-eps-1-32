Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ,
the target of a $40 billion hostile takeover offer from  BHP
Billiton Ltd. , reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates and raised its full-year earnings forecast.  Net income  climbed to $402.7 million, or $1.32 a share,
from $247.9 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp. said today in a statement. Per-
share profit topped the $1.16  average estimate  of 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The company increased its  forecast  for
full-year earnings to $5.75 to $6 a share from a previous
prediction of $5 to $5.50.  Chief Executive Officer Bill Doyle is raising potash prices
in the U.S. as demand rebounds from a slump last year. If Canada
approves BHP’s hostile bid for Potash Corp., the Melbourne-based
company will be under pressure to increase its $130-a-share
offer price, said  Mark Connelly , a New York-based analyst at
Credit Agricole SA.  “What really matters is that fertilizer prices are
rising,” Connelly said in a telephone interview before the
results were released. “That means whatever investors thought
Potash was worth in August when BHP first made its offer,
they’re thinking it’s worth even more now.”  Potash Corp. has rejected BHP’s $40 billion offer as too
low and said it was seeking alternative bids. The Canadian
government is to decide by Nov. 3 whether to approve or reject
the proposed deal based on a calculation of the transaction’s
“net benefit” to the country.  Rising Sales  Potash Corp., the world’s largest fertilizer producer by
market value, sold 1.9 million metric tons of potash in the
quarter, up from 1.01 million tons a year earlier. That beat the
1.5 million-ton average of three estimates from  Horst Hueniken ,
a Toronto-based analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., and two other
analysts.  “The process of replenishing nutrients accelerated quickly
and tangibly in the third quarter,” Doyle said in the
statement.  Potash Corp. raised its 2011 global forecast for
industrywide potash demand next year to 55 million tons to 60
million tons from a previous prediction of 55 million.  Potash Corp. was unchanged at $147.32 at 7:14 a.m. before
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The shares 
gained 36 percent this year before today.  2011 Profit Forecast  The company, which also produces phosphate and nitrogen-
based crop nutrients, said it expects full-year 2011 profit of
$8 to $8.75 a share. Twenty-six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated on average earnings of $7.83 next year.  Total  sales  in the third quarter rose 43 percent to $1.58
billion from $1.1 billion, more than the $1.34 billion estimated
by 16 analysts surveyed.  The company’s average selling price for potash fell to
$305.60 a ton in the three month period, from $308.64 in the
previous quarter and $389.24 a year earlier.  (Potash scheduled a conference call for 1 p.m. New York
time today at +1-877-881-1303.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
