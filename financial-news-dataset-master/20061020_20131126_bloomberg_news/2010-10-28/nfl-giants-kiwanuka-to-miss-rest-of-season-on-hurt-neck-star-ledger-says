New York Giants defensive end
 Mathias Kiwanuka  will miss the rest of the season because of a
herniated disc in his neck, the Star-Ledger of Newark, New
Jersey  reported on its web site , citing two unidentified people
familiar with the situation.  Kiwanuka, who had four sacks in his first three games this
season, will be placed on season-ending injured reserve today,
the Star-Ledger said. He’s sat out the past four games due to
the neck problem.  The Giants’ defense is third in the National Football
League with 24 sacks. Kiwanuka, 27, is in the final season of
his rookie contract with the Giants, whose 5-2 record is tied
for the best in the National Football Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
