The South African port of Durban
ranks as the most expensive of 12 international ports, while
efficiency at the facility is declining, Business Day reported,
citing Salvatore Sarno, chief executive officer of the
Mediterranean Shipping Co.  A total of 215 of the company’s vessels used the port
between January and September and suffered delays totaling more
than 500 days, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
