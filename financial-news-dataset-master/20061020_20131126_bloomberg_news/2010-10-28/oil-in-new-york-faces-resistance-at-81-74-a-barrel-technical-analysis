Oil in New York is facing resistance
at $81.74 a barrel, setting the stage for prices to climb to $87
or fall to $78, based on levels using Fibonacci analysis, the
Schork Group Inc. said.  Intra-day futures prices have straddled the 76.4 percent
retracement level of $81.74 for nine of the past 11 trading
sessions, Schork Group President  Stephen Schork  said in a report
yesterday. Prices may push to the top of the Fibonacci range at
$87.15, the highest price this year, or drop to $78.40,
depending on whether the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee
decides to buy government securities to boost economic growth.  “This is the textbook definition of sideways trading --
What are the markets waiting for?” the report said. “We are
waiting for the FOMC meeting and its implication for the dollar
before we place our bets.”  The FOMC, which makes decisions on money supply and U.S.
interest rates, is set to meet on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3. A decision
to buy government securities, known as quantitative easing, may
cause the dollar to decline against other currencies, increasing
the investment appeal of commodities.  The $78.40 a barrel level for crude is the 61.8 percent
retracement from the $87.15 high for the year.  Futures for December delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange traded at $82.13, up 19 cents, at 3:21 p.m. Singapore
time. Prices have risen 3.5 percent this year.  The Fibonacci sequence, identified by Italian mathematician
Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century, is used by traders in
financial markets to predict points of support and resistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
