Enel SpA will benefit from cutting
debt even if it sells shares of its alternative-energy unit
below the current price range, UBS AG analysts led by Alberto
Gandolfi said in a note sent to clients after the market closed
yesterday.  Shares of Enel Green Power SpA are likely to trade at a
discount to wind peers, the analysts said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
