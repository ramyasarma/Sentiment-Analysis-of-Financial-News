United Breweries Holdings Ltd. , the
owner of India’s second-biggest carrier  Kingfisher Airlines , was
sued in the U.K. by  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  over claims it owes
$7.7 million on a lease for 10 aircraft.  United Breweries, based in Bangalore, agreed in June 2007
to make-up any payments missed by Kingfisher on its lease of ten
 ATR-72  turboprop planes, Lloyds said in a complaint filed in the
High Court in London on Sept. 23 and made public today.  The lawsuit was filed by Lloyds’s  Bank of Scotland  unit,
which acted as security trustee for unspecified lenders that
financed the deal. The planes were purchased by Cayman Islands-
based KF Turbo Leasing Ltd., an entity that leased the aircraft
to Kingfisher, according to the filing.  The carrier gave the bank “various letters of credit as
security for sums due” and made other payments “many months
after the due dates” for a total of $4.59 million paid on the
lease, according to the filing. United Breweries should pay the
remaining sum plus legal costs, Lloyds said.  United Breweries didn’t immediately respond to a call
outside normal business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
