Japan Tobacco Inc. , the world’s
third-largest publicly traded cigarette maker, cut its profit
forecast as a stronger yen reduced overseas revenue.  Net income  may total 115 billion yen ($1.4 billion) in the
year ending March, compared with an earlier estimate of 133
billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement today.  A stronger yen, which has risen against all the world’s
major currencies in 2010, will trim sales gains at  Japan Tobacco 
by reducing the repatriated value of  earnings  from overseas. The
company, which sells cigarette brands including Mild Seven,
Winston and LD, has raised prices in countries including Russia
and Turkey.  Sales  rose 8 percent to 3.3 trillion yen in the six months
ended September, the company said.  Operating profit  increased 22
percent to 198.9 billion yen while  sales  after excise taxes
gained 5.2 percent to 1.3 trillion yen.  Japan Tobacco  cut its forecast based on changes in the
company’s foreign exchange-rate assumptions, Executive Deputy
President Munetaka Takeda told reporters in Tokyo. The full-year
profit estimate is based on an assumed exchange rate of 87 yen
per dollar, compared with 90 yen previously.  The company, which acquired the U.K.’s Gallaher Group in
2007, increased market share in countries including Russia,
Turkey and Italy in the first nine months of this year, it said.  Japan Tobacco  expects sales of 5.91 trillion yen, compared
with a previous 5.98 trillion yen forecast. It reduced its
domestic cigarette sales forecast to 125.5 billion cigarettes
from 127.5 billion.  Japan Tobacco  fell 1.1 percent to close at 260,600 yen in
Tokyo trading before the earnings announcement. The stock has
declined 17 percent this year, compared with a 10 percent drop
in the Topix index.  The cigarette maker will close a tobacco processing plant
in Yamaguchi prefecture, western Japan, in March 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
