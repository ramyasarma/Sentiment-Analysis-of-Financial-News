PMI Group Inc . led mortgage insurers
lower in New York trading after posting a 13th straight quarterly
loss as premium income declined.  PMI, the third-largest U.S. mortgage insurer, dropped 41
cents, or 10 percent, to $3.70, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 10:30 a.m.  MGIC Investment Corp. , the
biggest mortgage insurer, fell 4.7 percent, and No. 2  Radian
Group Inc.  was down 5 percent. PMI has advanced 46 percent this
year.  PMI’s loss widened to $281.1 million, or $1.74 a share,
from $93.2 million, or $1.06, a year earlier. Premium revenue at
the Walnut Creek, California-based declined 21 percent to $139.8
million in the third quarter.  “When they can return to profitability, and their market
share,” are the questions facing PMI, said  Douglas Harter , an
analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG. “Those really are the
issues.”  U.S.  unemployment rates  near the highest in a quarter
century depressed the housing market and increased costs at
insurers like PMI, which reimburse lenders when borrowers fail
to pay. PMI, MGIC and Radian all raised capital this year
through bond or stock sales to cushion against losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
