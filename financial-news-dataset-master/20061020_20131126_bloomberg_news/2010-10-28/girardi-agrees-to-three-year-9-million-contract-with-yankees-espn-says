Joe Girardi  agreed to a three-year,
$9 million contract to return as manager of the New York
Yankees, ESPN reported on its website.  The agreement also includes incentives that may add another
$500,000 if the Yankees win the World Series,  ESPN.com  said,
citing two unidentified people familiar with the negotiations.  Girardi’s new salary will put him among the five highest-
paid managers in Major League Baseball, ESPN said. His last
contract paid $7 million over three years.  The Yankees went 287-199 during Girardi’s first three years
managing the franchise. In 2008, they missed the postseason for
the first time since 1994. They responded last season with their
27th World Series title and lost this year’s American League
Championship Series in six games to the Texas Rangers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
