China’s yuan fell to its weakest
level this month after the central bank set a lower reference
rate for a third day, spurring speculation the government is
limiting appreciation.  The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate 0.11
percent weaker at 6.6986 against the greenback as the Dollar
 Index  traded on ICE Futures in New York rose 0.6 percent this
week. The yuan has weakened 0.5 percent since policy makers from
the Group of 20 nations said on Oct. 23 they would refrain from
“competitive devaluation” in the run-up to the leaders’ summit
in Seoul on Nov. 11-12.  “The PBOC is taking every opportunity of dollar strength
against the majors to fix the yuan’s reference rate weaker,”
said  Dariusz Kowalczyk , a Hong Kong-based economist and
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “It’s likely to make sure
that the yuan appreciation they have to deliver ahead of G-20
will not be too strong.”  The yuan declined 0.2 percent to 6.6910 per dollar as of
10:10 a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It touched 6.6918, the weakest level since Sept.
30. The yuan is little changed this month.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were steady at
6.4955, reflecting bets the currency will strengthen 3 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s trade  surplus  this year may be $180 billion,
Commerce Minister Chen Deming told officials at a meeting in
Guangzhou, the 21st Century Business Herald reported today,
citing an unidentified official. The  gap  was $196 billion last
year.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Ven Ram ,  Andrew Janes   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
