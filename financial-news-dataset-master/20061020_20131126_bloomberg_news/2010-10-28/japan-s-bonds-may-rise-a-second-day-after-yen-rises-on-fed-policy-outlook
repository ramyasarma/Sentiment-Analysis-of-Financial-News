Japan’s bonds headed for a seventh
monthly gain as a strengthening yen pushed down stocks and
boosted demand for the safety of government debt.  Bonds extended their monthly winning streak to the longest
since December 1993 after the Bank of Japan yesterday brought
forward the date of its next policy meeting, fueling speculation
it will follow the Federal Reserve in increasing debt purchases
to spur growth. Bonds were also boosted as government reports
showed industrial production declined for a fourth month and
consumer prices dropped for a 19th.  “The BOJ can introduce additional measures if markets
react to the Fed’s policy excessively,” said  Takehito Yoshino ,
who helps oversee the equivalent of $24.8 billion as chief fund
manager at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s second-
largest bank. “The BOJ will be ready to take swift action if
the yen rises. This expectation has weighed on yields.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell half a basis
point to 0.90 percent as of the 11:05 a.m. morning close in
Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The 0.8 percent bond due September 2020
rose 0.045 yen to 99.092 yen. Yields have dropped three basis
points this month.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery dropped 0.03 to
143.48 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The yen jumped 0.9 percent against the dollar yesterday,
the biggest advance since Aug. 24, before trading at 80.66 today.
Japan’s currency rose to 80.41 on Oct. 25, the strongest level
since April 1995.  Fed Buying  Fed policy makers meet on Nov. 2-3 to consider steps to
boost an economy growing too slowly to reduce unemployment.
Market participants are focusing on the size, timing and
maturities of likely purchases aimed at lowering long-term rates.  The BOJ, which left its benchmark interest rate and credit
programs unchanged yesterday, will meet on Nov. 4-5. The central
bank plans to discuss purchases of exchange-traded funds and
real-estate investment trusts, it said.  Japanese industrial production fell 1.9 percent in
September from August, when it dropped 0.5 percent, the Trade
Ministry said today in Tokyo. Consumer prices excluding fresh
food slid 1.1 percent last month from a year earlier, the
statistics bureau said.  Japan’s government bonds have handed investors a return of
3 percent this year, according to an index compiled by Merrill
Lynch & Co.  The Ministry of Finance will auction 2.2 trillion yen
($27.2 billion) of 10-year bonds on Nov. 2. The previous 10-year
sale on Oct. 7 drew bids for 2.85 times the amount on offer,
compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.16 at the
September auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
