Indian companies are paying the
highest short-term borrowing costs in 19 months as the central
bank raises interest rates to contain inflation and investors
drain cash for initial public offerings.  Rates for three-month  funds  almost doubled to 8.25 percent
this year as policy makers boosted benchmark interest rates five
times to curb  price increases  that have averaged 9.7 percent.
Three-month commercial paper yields for top-rated borrowers
jumped 72 basis points, or 0.72 percentage point, this month as
investors pulled money from banks to buy stock in  Coal India
Ltd. ’s 152 billion rupee ($3.4 billion) offering, the nation’s
biggest-ever initial share sale.  With economists predicting Reserve Bank of India Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao will raise the  repurchase rate  for a sixth time
on Nov. 2, costs for companies may continue to increase. Central
banks from the U.S. to Japan have cut benchmark borrowing levels
to near zero to prop up their economies. Three-month commercial
paper rates in the U.S. are  0.31 percent , while borrowers in
China are paying 2.8 percent, according to Bloomberg data.  “Funding costs for companies have risen significantly,
driven by policy measures aimed at curbing inflation,”  Raman Uberoi , Mumbai-based senior director at Crisil Ltd., the Indian
unit of Standard & Poor’s, said in an interview yesterday.
“Increasing working capital costs would put some pressure on
corporate profitability in India.”  Commercial Paper  L&T Finance Ltd., a unit of the nation’s biggest
engineering company in Mumbai, sold three-month commercial paper
on Oct. 26 at a yield of 8.2 percent, according to data provided
by Mumbai-based NVS Brokerage Ltd.  Infrastructure Development
Finance Co. , a state-run lender to power and road projects, sold
similar-maturity debt at 7.85 percent the same day, according to
data provided by Mata Securities India Pvt. in Mumbai.  Indian lenders  borrowed  900 billion rupees from the central
bank on Oct. 25, the most since 2008, to replenish cash as
companies led by state-owned Coal India raised more since Jan. 1
selling shares than in any previous full year.  Equity offerings in Asia’s second-fastest-growing major
economy after China are poised to drain more money as the
government will raise about 400 billion rupees in seven more
sales by the end of March, according to an e-mailed note sent
Oct. 21 by SMC Global Securities Ltd., the nation’s fourth-
biggest brokerage. Earnings for companies in the Bombay Stock
Exchange’s  Sensitive Index  jumped 56 percent this year to 1,028
rupees a share, poised for the biggest annual gain since
Bloomberg started compiling the data in 2000.  Foreign Investors  Overseas investors have poured $24.7 billion into Indian
equities so far this year, 72 percent more than in the year-
earlier period and heading for the biggest-ever  annual increase ,
according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  The  cost  of fixing rates on money for three months surged
280 basis points this year to 6.75 percent in India’s interest-
rate swaps market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Overnight
 loan rates  between banks averaged 6.3 percent this month, up
from 3.3 percent in October 2009, as Coal India received bids
for 15 times the stock offered.  India’s 10-year  bonds  extended gains today, after rising
the most in two months yesterday, as yields at their highest
level in two years lured investors. The rate on the 7.8 percent
note due May 2020 fell two basis points to 8.11 percent as of
1:13 p.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  The rupee slid to 44.52 per dollar from 44.46 yesterday,
when it dropped to 44.635, the lowest since Oct. 12.  The extra yield investors demand to hold India’s top-rated
local corporate bonds over government debt has fallen to 59
basis points from 86 at the start of the year.  Bill Yields  India’s three-month  Treasury bill  yields have risen 323
basis points this year as the Reserve Bank lifted its repo rate
by 125 points, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The comparable
measure climbed 199 points to 10.69 percent in Brazil and 8
points to 0.13 percent in the U.S. Rates on similar  notes  from
the People’s Bank of China rose 69 points to 2.01 percent.  The government yesterday sold 40 billion rupees of 91-day
bills at 6.8536 percent, compared with 6.7706 percent a week
earlier. It auctioned 182-day debt at 7.0587 percent, up from
6.8225 percent on Oct. 13.  ‘Feeling the Pinch’  The cash shortage at India’s banks may further raise
borrowing costs for companies as demand for loans strengthens,
according to  Mohan Shenoi , the head of Treasury at the Mumbai-
based Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. The pace of annual growth in bank
 lending  almost doubled in the year ended Oct. 8 to 20.1 percent
from the previous 12 months, central bank data show.  “More than the increase in policy rates, the tight
liquidity is hurting everyone and industry is feeling the
pinch,” Shenoi said in an Oct. 26 interview. “This scale of
tightness for a prolonged period could have significant impact
on loan pricing.”  Credit-default swaps on State Bank of India rose two basis
points yesterday to 163 points, according to data provider CMA.
Such swaps usually pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt,
and they rise as perceptions of credit quality deteriorate.  Indian companies have sold 1.59 trillion rupees of bonds
this year, up from 1.48 trillion rupees in all of 2009. Local-
currency debt sales climbed 42 percent to 14.6 billion real
($8.6 billion) in Brazil, while in Russia they are lagging
behind last year’s amount by 18 percent, the data show.  The South Asian nation’s share sales have totaled 1
trillion rupees, beating a previous record of 782 billion rupees
set in 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ratings Improve  Crisil raised the debt ratings on 253 Indian borrowers in
the six months ended Sept. 30, the most since it started
business in 1987, the agency said last week. The credit assessor
downgraded 111 borrowers. ICRA Ltd., an arm of Moody’s Investors
Service, has upgraded 102 companies and cut 65 this year, the
best ratio since 2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The rate at which banks lend to each other overnight rose
to a one-month high of  7 percent  this week after a government
plan to pump funds into banks by buying back existing bonds
achieved less than a quarter of the targeted amount of
repurchases. The Finance Ministry bought 25 billion rupees of
fixed-income securities at an auction on Oct. 25 after offering
to pick up notes worth as much as 120 billion rupees. The
auction was the first in a plan to repurchase as much as 285.5
billion rupees of bonds maturing in 2010 and 2011.  ‘Bound to Fail’  “The buyback was bound to fail” because banks that are
already short on cash hold only enough bonds to meet regulatory
requirements,  Abheek Barua , chief economist in New Delhi at HDFC
Bank Ltd., India’s third largest, said in an Oct. 26 interview.
Indian banks must hold at least 25 percent of deposits in low-
risk debt approved by regulators.  Three-month treasury bills in India now yield a  record  651
basis points more than the three-month dollar London interbank
offered rate, a measure of funding costs for global investors
that is currently 0.29 percent.  India’s 10-year government bond yield is the highest among
the major emerging economies except Brazil, where similar-
maturity notes pay 12.2 percent. Comparable securities offer
3.51 percent in China. U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield 2.69
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher yields prompted overseas investors to more than
double holdings of India’s corporate and government debt in 2010
to a record  $17.3 billion  on Oct. 25. Accelerated investment
inflows helped the rupee strengthen 5.2 percent against the
dollar in the past three months, the third-best performance
among Asia’s 10-most traded currencies.  “Costs have risen for companies because short-term yields
have gone up,”  R .  Govindan , Mumbai-based treasurer at Larsen &
Toubro Ltd., said in an Oct. 26 interview. “If credit growth
picks up further, then it will be a problem.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
