Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index
retreated for a second day, erasing an earlier advance, as Vale
SA fell and credit-card processors sank after Redecard SA
reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Redecard SA , Brazil’s second-largest card-payment processor
by market value, tumbled 5.7 percent, the most in five months.
Cielo SA, Redecard’s larger competitor, dropped 1.7 percent.
Vale, the world’s biggest iron ore producer, lost 1.7 percent.
The Bovespa’s decline was limited by an advance in  Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  after it said third-quarter
profit rose 15 percent.  The Bovespa fell 0.4 percent to 70,320.13 after climbing 1
percent earlier today. Thirty-seven stocks fell on the index
while 30 advanced. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap index  slipped 0.4
percent to 1,406.35. The real rose 1 percent to 1.7042 per
dollar. The Bovespa is headed for a 1.3 percent gain for the
month, with Vale rising 3.5 percent in October, offsetting a
decline for steelmakers.  “There seems to be a rotation trade going on where people
that made money with Vale are looking for underperformers and
the steels have come down a lot,” said  Eric Anderson , chief
investment officer for Latin America at ING Asset Management in
New York, which oversees about $66 billion in the region. “I’m
not convinced it will continue though.”  Redecard Retreats  Redecard, based in Sao Paulo, sank 5.7 percent to 22.50
reais. The Sao Paulo-based company said today adjusted net
income fell 2.7 percent to 324.1 million reais ($189.5 million)
in the third quarter. The mean estimate for net income excluding
some items was 342.9 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  The company has boosted expenses in the past few quarters
after Cielo, the country’s biggest credit-card processor by
market value, ended its exclusive right to handle Visa-branded
transactions in July,  Federico Rey Marino  and  Francisco Pereyra ,
analysts at Raymond James, wrote in an Oct. 26 report. The
company’s costs and operational expenses increased 41 percent
from a year earlier, Redecard said. Cielo dropped 1.7 percent to
14.60 reais.  Vale dropped 1.7 percent to 47.90 reais. Vale, the world’s
biggest iron-ore producer, said third-quarter profit more than
tripled on rising prices and demand for the steelmaking raw
material. Iron ore revenue was “strong,” although aluminum,
fertilizer, logistics and coal were “weak,”  Rene Kleyweg, 
an analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a note to clients today.  Usiminas rose 4.5 percent to 20.96 reais. Net income rose
to 495.3 million reais from 431 million reais in the year-
earlier period, the Belo Horizonte-based company said today in a
statement. The company was expected to post a profit of 388
million reais on an adjusted basis, according to the average of
eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
