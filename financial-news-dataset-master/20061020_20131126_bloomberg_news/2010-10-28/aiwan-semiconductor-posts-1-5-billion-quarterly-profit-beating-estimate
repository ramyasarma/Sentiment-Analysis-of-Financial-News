Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. , the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips, posted
a fourth straight quarter of profit growth after demand for
smartphones helped sales beat its guidance.  Third-quarter net income climbed 54 percent to NT$46.9
billion ($1.5 billion) from NT$30.6 billion a year earlier, the
Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said in a statement today. The
average of 19 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was for
profit of NT$40 billion. Sales climbed 25 percent to NT$112.3
billion.  Earnings were boosted by a non-operating profit of NT$6.6
billion after it booked gains on its investments, Taiwan
Semiconductor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
