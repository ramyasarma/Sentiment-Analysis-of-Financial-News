China’s exports may slide from year-
earlier levels in coming months, providing justification for the
government to rein in gains by the yuan against the dollar,
according to Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the nation’s shipments abroad
since 2008, with RBS forecasting declines in February, May and
June of next year on high comparative bases, seasonal factors
and softness in global demand.  China, the world’s biggest exporter, this month reported a
25 percent rise in exports in September, to $145 billion.  Currencies are at the heart of trade tensions, with U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  arguing that further
appreciation in the yuan would help reduce imbalances in global
supply and demand, fostering economic stability. Group of 20
finance chiefs who met in South Korea this month pledged in a
statement to move toward “more market determined exchange-rate
systems.”  Worsening export growth and a narrowing trade surplus will
provide China with “ammunition to say to the rest of the world
that the rebalancing is taking place,” said Hong Kong-based RBS
economist  Ben Simpfendorfer .  Large gains in the currency are “unlikely,” he said,
forecasting that the yuan will climb to 6.55 per dollar by year-
end and 6.45 by mid-2011. The currency closed yesterday at
6.6874.  -- Zheng Lifei , Jay Wang. Editors:  Paul Panckhurst ,  Ken McCallum .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
