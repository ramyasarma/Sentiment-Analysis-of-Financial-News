Extending U.K. daylight saving into
the winter could cut a power station’s worth of electricity from
peak evening demand, a  National Grid Plc  executive said.  About 1,300 megawatts of power demand could be slashed from
peak evening usage if clocks aren’t put back an hour at the end
of October, Alan Smart, operations manager for National Grid,
told Parliament’s  Energy and Climate Change Committee  today.
Clocks are due to go back an hour on Oct. 31, meaning it’ll get
darker earlier in the evening and sunrise will come sooner.  Britain’s electricity use typically has three peaks a day -
- in the morning, at tea-time, or about 5 p.m., and at dark,
Smart said. Changing the clocks can mean the two later peaks
coincide, Smart told the committee, which is probing whether the
nation could save energy by changing its time.  “If you compare Tuesday evening’s demand this week,
compared with Tuesday evening’s demand next week, it will be
higher in the order of 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts" next week,
Smart said. ‘‘That’s about one large power station, or in the
region of 100,000 households.”  The change would cut about 1,300 megawatts from peak demand
in November, February and March, he said. In December and
January, when it would be dark at about 5 p.m. regardless of the
clocks, there’s a “very marginal” effect, he said.  Even so, the change in demand is difficult to forecast
because gloomy weather can affect peak times, as can television
programs, he said.  “This darkness peak can actually get triggered by the end
of the television program” if it’s become dark since the show
started, Smart said. When it ends, “you get up, you put your
lounge light on, you put your hall light, you put the kitchen
light on and then you go and put the kettle on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
