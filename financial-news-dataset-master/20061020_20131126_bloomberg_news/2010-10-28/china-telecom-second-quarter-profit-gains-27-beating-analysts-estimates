China Telecom Corp. , the country’s
biggest fixed-line carrier, posted third-quarter profit that
beat analyst estimates as the company’s mobile-phone unit added
subscribers.  Profit  excluding gains from connection fees rose 27 percent
to 3.78 billion yuan ($565 million) from 2.98 billion yuan a
year earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement on
its  website  today. Income was projected to be 3.54 billion yuan,
according to the median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Chairman  Wang Xiaochu  has used handset subsidies and
promotional calling rates to boost mobile subscribers 77 percent
in the past year and grab share from market leader  China Mobile
Ltd.  China Telecom is holding on to customers in the fixed-line
phone business by offering the service as a package with
broadband Internet.  “The results are quite good and it’s mainly about the
bundling strategy that, so far, is working,” said  Marvin Lo , a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets. He
rates the shares “outperform” and doesn’t own any. “The
company is migrating, even for fixed-line, to more of a data
orientation and that helps offset the decline in voice on the
fixed-line side.”  China Telecom rose 0.2 percent to close at HK$4.15 in Hong
Kong  trading . The stock has gained 28 percent this year compared
with a 6.1 percent rise in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Gaining Market Share  Third-quarter  sales  rose 6.5 percent to 55.6 billion yuan,
from 52.2 billion yuan. That was below the analysts’ 55.8
billion-yuan median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey.  The number of mobile subscribers increased to 82.98 million
at the end of September, from 46.78 million a year earlier,
China Telecom said Oct. 25. The company still ranks third in
wireless users in China, behind China Mobile and  China Unicom
(Hong Kong) Limited.   China Telecom entered the wireless market in 2008 by
 acquiring  the smaller of China Unicom’s two mobile divisions in
a government-led revamp of the Chinese mobile-phone industry.  Beijing-based China Telecom’s share of the nation’s mobile
market rose more than 3 percentage points in the past 12 months
to 10 percent of China’s total 833.3 million subscribers. China
Mobile’s market share declined to 68 percent from 71 percent a
year earlier. China Unicom’s share dropped to 19 percent from 20
percent a year earlier.  China Telecom spent 6.1 billion yuan on handset subsidies
in the first half this year, or about 27 percent of the mobile-
phone division’s revenue, Wang said in August. The proportion
will be lower than 30 percent for the full year, he said at the
time.  China Mobile,  the world’s biggest phone carrier by market
value, on Oct. 20 posted third-quarter  net income  that rose 3.5
percent to 29.6 billion yuan. China Unicom will announce results
tomorrow.  -- Edmond Lococo . Editors:  Anand Krishnamoorthy ,  Young-Sam Cho .  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
