(Corrects APD cost in story first moved on Oct. 29 in
second paragraph.)  Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. said an
increase in U.K. air passenger duty, or APD, this month will add
450 million pounds ($720 million) to the price of family
vacations next year.  As a result of the increase, which takes effect today, the
average APD cost of a vacation to Florida for a family of four
travelling on an economy package will increase to 240 pounds,
Crawley, England-based Virgin Atlantic said in an e-mailed
statement.  The rise in the duty is the third in three years, the
airline said. BAA Ltd.’s Chief Executive Officer Colin Matthews
said on Oct. 27 that London’s Heathrow airport may become less
competitive against other European hubs and demand for long-haul
leisure flights to the city may be hurt because of the tax
increase.  “Given the forecasted rises in APD over the next five
years, all travelers will be more than paying their fair share
and in fact contributing more to the Treasury than the banks via
the new banking levy,” Julie Southern, Virgin Atlantic’s chief
commercial officer, said in the statement. “This absolutely has
to be the last time that the travelling public faces APD
rises.”  From this month, passengers travelling from the U.K. to
destinations more than 6,000 miles away are set to pay as much
as 170 pounds in APD, an increase of 55 percent from the current
rate of 110 pounds. That compares with a maximum tax of 40 euros
($56) levied in France, and as much as 45 euros starting on Jan.
