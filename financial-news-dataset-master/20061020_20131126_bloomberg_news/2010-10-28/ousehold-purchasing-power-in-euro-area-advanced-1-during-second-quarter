The European Central Bank said the
purchasing power of euro-area households improved in the second
quarter as the economy gathered strength.  Households’ gross disposable income rose 1 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier after increasing 0.6 percent
in the previous three months, partly because of “increases in
compensation,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said in a report on its
 website  today. The gross savings rate was 14.7 percent, down
from 14.9 percent in the second quarter of 2009.  The 16-member  economy  expanded 1 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three-month period, when it grew 0.3
percent. That’s the fastest pace in four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
