Australia’s Queensland state has
identified 11 new sites for geothermal energy exploration, as
the nation seeks cleaner energy alternatives to coal and oil.  The sites cover about 3,000 square kilometers (1,864 square
miles), Queensland Mines and Energy Minister  Stephen Robertson 
said in a  statement  yesterday.  The state has granted 40 permits for geothermal exploration
since the first calls for tenders were gazetted in 2005.  Robertson told Parliament yesterday the state will also
invest A$5 million ($4.9 million) to determine the geothermal
potential of areas closer to coastal power transmission
infrastructure.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
