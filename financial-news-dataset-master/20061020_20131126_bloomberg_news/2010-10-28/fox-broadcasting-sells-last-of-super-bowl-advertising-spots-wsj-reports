Fox Broadcasting sold the last of
its commercial spots for the 2011 Super Bowl, which it will air
in February, The Wall Street Journal said, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter.  The last sale comes months earlier than usual, the
newspaper said. A 30-second ad will sell for between $2.8
million and $3 million, above this year’s rates, the Journal
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
