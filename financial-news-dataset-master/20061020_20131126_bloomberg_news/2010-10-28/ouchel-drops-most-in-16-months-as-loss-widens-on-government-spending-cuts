Mouchel Group Plc , a U.K. road and
infrastructure-maintenance company, fell the most in 16 months
in London trading after posting a widened full-year loss as
government spending was trimmed.  Mouchel  fell  as much as 34 percent, the most since June
2009. The loss for the year ended July 31 was 13.5 million
pounds ($21.2 million), compared with a loss of 13 million
pounds a year earlier, the Woking, England-based company said in
a Regulatory News Service statement today. Revenue fell 15
percent to 632.6 million pounds.  Prime Minister David Cameron’s coalition government has
pledged to cut public-sector spending, triggering “the
postponement or reduction in scale of various” projects,
Mouchel said today. A “significant fall” in work in the Middle
East and one-time restructuring and impairment charges also
damped profit.  “Trading in the current year has started more slowly than
expected and the immediate outlook remains uncertain,” said
Chief Executive Officer  Richard Cuthbert  in today’s statement.
“It is right that the group takes a more cautious approach to
performance through 2011 and perhaps beyond.”  The company said it won’t pay a final dividend for the year
as it conserves resources to reduce debt. The company has
started discussions with banks to refinance debt, which it
expects to complete by March, it said. Banks are “supportive”
of the process, Mouchel said.  Mouchel dropped as much as 43 pence to 83 pence, the lowest
since at least 2002, and traded at that price as of 10 a.m. The
stock has dropped 68 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 95.5 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
