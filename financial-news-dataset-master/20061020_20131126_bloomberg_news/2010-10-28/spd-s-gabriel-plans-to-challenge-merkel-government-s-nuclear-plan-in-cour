Sigmar Gabriel, leader of Germany’s
main opposition Social Democratic Party, said that his party
will challenge the government’s nuclear plans in court.  If the SPD returns to power at elections in 2013, “we
would overturn this nonsense,” Gabriel said on ARD television
today, as the lower house of parliament prepared to vote on
plans by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to prolong the
use of nuclear power.  Asked if he intends to challenge at the constituional court
in Karlsruhe the government’s plans to bypass the upper house,
Gabriel said: “That’s correct.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
