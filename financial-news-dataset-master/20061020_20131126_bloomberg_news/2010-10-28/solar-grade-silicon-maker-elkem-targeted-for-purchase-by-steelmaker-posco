Posco , the world’s third-biggest
steelmaker by output, said it is reviewing a possible purchase
of Norway’s  Elkem ASA , a maker of solar-grade silicon and
special alloys.  The company has yet to make a decision, Pohang, South
Korea-based Posco said today in a regulatory filing after the
Korea Exchange sought a clarification on reports about a
potential purchase. Posco has completed due diligence on Elkem
and is starting purchase talks, MoneyToday reported today,
citing unidentified industry officials. The acquisition may cost
more than $1 billion, the report said, without citing anyone.  Posco Chief Executive Officer  Chung Joon Yang , who last
month completed the takeover of  Daewoo International Corp.  in
the country’s biggest acquisition this year, is spearheading a
$30 billion capacity expansion in nations including Indonesia,
India and Vietnam. Elkem is part of Orkla ASA, a diversified
company with products ranging from frozen pizzas to chemicals.  “It’s positive for us that a large and serious company
like Posco is showing interest in some of our assets,” Orkla
Chief Executive Officer  Bjoern Wiggen  said today in an interview.
“We aren’t commenting on which parties are in concrete
discussions.”  Elkem’s sales last year fell to 7.4 billion krone ($1.3
billion) from 9.1 billion krone in 2008, according to the
company’s  website.  Elkem has about 2,500 employees and runs
plants in Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
