The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
climb as high as 1,350 next year, according to Christian
Bendixen of Bay Crest Partners LLC, who uses the Fibonacci
system to forecast stock prices.  The New York-based analyst derives that target by using the
S&P 500’s “pivotal” levels around 1,300 in 2008 and 1,355.44,
which would allow the benchmark to recoup  76.4 percent  of the
loss during the 2007-2009 bear market. Even during the market’s
plunge from April to July, he said, the S&P 500 was able to hold
above 1,010.71, or 61.8 percent of the gain from the bull
market’s beginning in March 2009 through this year’s peak in
April, a sign the rally will resume.  The  S&P 500  has climbed 16 percent from its 2010 low on
July 2 as investors speculated that the Federal Reserve will
pump more cash into the economy to safeguard the recovery.
Fibonacci analysts use a system pioneered by 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa that assumes asset prices will
follow patterns based on proportions found in nature.  “We started the next major leg higher of this cycle at the
beginning of July after completing a major intermediate
correction,” Bendixen, director of technical research at Bay
Crest, said in a telephone interview. “The market is very
resilient and the price action is very bullish.”  Market Momentum  Two trend indicators suggest the market has picked up
momentum to sustain the rally into next year, Bendixen said. The
weekly  Moving Average Convergence/Divergence line , calculated by
subtracting the S&P 500’s average level during the past 26
periods from the average over the past 12 periods, turned
positive in September after sinking below zero in July for the
first time since January 2008. At the same time, the index’s 14-
day  relative strength index  managed to rise above 40 after
falling below the threshold in the previous two months.  The momentum will help push the benchmark above the
“resistance” between its 2010 high of 1,220 and 1,225.70, a
level where the index recovers 61.8 percent of its bear market
loss between October 2007 and March 2009, Bendixen said. The S&P
500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,181.58 as of 10:55 a.m. in New York,
and is up 5.9 percent this year.  “We’ve started a new primary wave higher that will break
above 1,220 by the end of the year or the next few weeks,” he
said. “That opens the door to the extension of the cyclical
bull market.”  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
