South Africa’s Reserve Bank may
lower its 6 percent benchmark interest rate by a “final” 25
basis points when it meets next month, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc said in a research note today.  The rand is about 12 percent overvalued “on average”
against the currencies of South Africa’s trading partners, RBS
said in the note. The Pretoria-based central bank is scheduled
to announce its next interest rate decision on Nov. 18,
according to its web site.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
