Nissan Motor Co ., Japan’s third
largest automaker, will recall 2.14 million vehicles globally to
fix a defect that can cause the engine to stall.  The recalls include 761,528 vehicles in North America,
spokesman  Toshitake Inoshita  said by phone today. In Japan,
Nissan will repair nine models, including the March, Note and
Tiida compact cars, and will recall 834,759 vehicles, according
to a statement on the website of the nation’s transport ministry.
There have been no accidents and injuries related to problem,
Nissan said.  Shares in Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan fell 0.1 percent to
729 yen in Tokyo trading. The stock has fallen 10 percent in
2010.  Toyota Motor Corp ., the nation’s biggest automaker, and
second-ranked  Honda Motor Co.  recalled models earlier this month
for a separate problem. Toyota said Oct. 21 that it would repair
1.53 million vehicles worldwide for a flaw linked to brake-fluid
leaks. Honda recalled 471,820 models in the U.S. for a similar
defect on Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
