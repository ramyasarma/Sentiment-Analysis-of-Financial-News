3M Co. , the maker of Scotch tape and
optical films used to brighten TV screens, fell the most since
May in New York trading after cutting its 2010 profit forecast
and saying pension costs would hurt earnings next year.  Full-year profit will be 6 cents lower than previously
forecast because of acquisitions announced during the quarter,
St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M said today in a statement. Earnings
reductions in 2011 include 30 cents for pension expenses and 8
cents for a change in vacation benefits, 3M said.  3M had said the purchases would initially decrease results.
It is buying Cogent Inc., a maker of fingerprint identification
systems; Attenti Holdings SA, a maker of electronic tracking
tools including ankle bracelets; and Arizant Inc., a maker of
blankets used to protect hospital patients against hypothermia.  The company sees full-year profit of at most $5.74 a share,
compared with a previous forecast of as much as $5.80.  3M, whose products range from Post-It Notes to sanding
belts, dropped $3.97, or 4.4 percent, to $86.40 at 9:55 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The  shares  earlier
fell to $85.94 for the steepest intraday drop since May 6. The
decline was the most among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.  Net income advanced 16 percent to $1.11 billion, or $1.53 a
share, exceeding analysts’ estimates by 2 cents, as sales of
consumer-electronics components climbed.  Revenue increased 11 percent to $6.87 billion, helped by
emerging markets. Almost two-thirds of the company’s sales are
from outside the U.S.  Analysts , on average, estimated $6.79
billion, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
