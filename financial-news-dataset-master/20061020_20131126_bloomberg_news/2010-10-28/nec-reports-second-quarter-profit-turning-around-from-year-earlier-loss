NEC Corp. , Japan’s largest maker of
personal computers, posted a second-quarter profit that beat
analyst estimates after reducing its stake in an unprofitable
semiconductor business.  Net income  was 16.1 billion yen ($197 million) in the three
months ended Sept. 30, compared with a year-earlier loss of 9.8
billion yen, Tokyo-based NEC said today. The average of three
 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of 9.9
billion yen.  The provider of information-technology services and telecom
equipment merged its chip unit, NEC Electronics Corp., with
unlisted semiconductor maker Renesas Technology Corp. in April,
diluting its share in the business to 34 percent from about 70
percent. The company said reorganizing its chip business boosted
operating profit by as much as 40.6 billion yen in the first
half compared with a year earlier.  NEC  was unchanged at 229 yen at the 3 p.m. close on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange before the announcement. The stock has
dropped 4.2 percent this year, while the benchmark  Nikkei 225
Stock Average  has lost 11 percent.  The company maintained its May forecast for net income to
rise 31 percent to 15 billion yen in the year ending March 31
and sales to fall 7.9 percent to 3.3 trillion yen. Operating
profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative
expenses, will probably almost double to 100 billion yen, the
company said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
