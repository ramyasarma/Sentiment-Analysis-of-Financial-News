United Co. Rusal said billionaire
Chief Executive Officer Oleg Deripaska didn’t discuss selling
the company’s 25 percent stake in OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel with
fellow shareholder billionaire Vladimir Potanin.  “Rusal has no intention of selling its shareholding in
Norilsk Nickel,” the company said in an e-mailed statement,
denying a report in the Kommersant newspaper today about a
meeting between the two businessmen. “As such, any speculation
on this subject is baseless.”  Potanin, who also owns 25 percent of Norilsk, wrote to
Rusal Chairman Viktor Vekselberg on Oct. 22 urging him to
discuss selling Rusal’s stake in the world’s biggest nickel
producer for $9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
