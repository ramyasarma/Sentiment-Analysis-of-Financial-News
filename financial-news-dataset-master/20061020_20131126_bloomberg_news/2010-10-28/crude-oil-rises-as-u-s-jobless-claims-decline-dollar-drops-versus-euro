Crude oil rose as the dollar tumbled
against most major currencies on speculation the Federal Reserve
will curb the greenback’s value by buying government debt.  Oil climbed 0.3 percent as the dollar fell against the euro
for the first time in three days, bolstering the appeal of
commodities. Initial U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly dropped
21,000 to a three-month low of 434,000 last week, signaling the
labor market may be on the mend.  “Commodities are real assets that hold their value even as
the dollar declines,” said  Chris Barber , a senior analyst at
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts.
“Commodities are finite compared with the amount of dollars
that can be printed.”  Crude oil for December delivery rose 24 cents to settle at
$82.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are
up 6.1 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for December settlement increased 36 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $83.59 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  Estimates for the size of the asset-purchase program range
from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch to $2 trillion
at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . Economists at both firms agree the
Fed will probably start by announcing a $500 billion plan after
a meeting on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3.  The U.S. currency slumped as much as 1.3 percent to $1.3946
against the euro before trading at $1.3928 at 3:13 p.m. The  S&P
500  increased 0.1 percent to 1,183.38 and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average decreased 14.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to
11,111.71.  Commodity Rally  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
advanced 0.3 percent to 299.89. Twelve of the commodities
gained, six declined and one was unchanged. Gold futures for
December delivery increased $19.90, or 1.5 percent, to settle at
$1,342.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2 percent annual pace
in the third quarter, up from a 1.7 percent rate in the previous
three months, based on the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
poll of economists before a Commerce Department report tomorrow.  “The markets are wildly choppy,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief
market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St.
Louis. “Oil traders are looking at the dollar and stocks for
direction. We will have to wait for the fundamentals to improve
before prices can move much higher.”  Oil Inventories  Crude oil supplies  climbed 5.01 million barrels to 366.2
million in the week ended Oct. 22, the biggest increase since
July, an Energy Department report showed yesterday.  Gasoline
inventories  plunged 4.39 million barrels to 214.9 million, the
largest drop since the week ended Oct. 9, 2009.  Gasoline for November delivery gained 1.19 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.1139 a gallon in New York. It was the highest
settlement since Oct. 18.  Strikes to protest measures to raise the retirement age in
France shut refineries and ports. Seven out of 11 plants in the
country are operational, though some are still idled by lack of
crude,  Jean-Louis Schilansky , director of the UFIP, a refinery
industry group, said today on France Info radio. Earlier this
week, all active plants were on strike or idle.  At the Port of Marseille on the Mediterranean coast, 38
crude-oil carriers and 29 oil-product tankers are stranded
because of the monthlong strike, port agents Inchcape Shipping
Services said.  “Gasoline continues to be the leader,” said  Tom Bentz , a
broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York.
“Gasoline cargoes may have been diverted because of the French
strike and the Bayway power outage on Monday may have caused
tightness in New York Harbor.”  New Jersey Refinery  ConocoPhillips lost power at its Bayway refinery in Linden,
New Jersey, on Oct. 25. The company has restored power and will
begin startup of the fluid catalytic cracker this weekend,  Ed Choromanski , administrator for air compliance and enforcement at
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said in
an e-mail.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase shipments by 1.5 percent in the four weeks to Nov. 13,
according to Oil Movements, which monitors tanker charters. The
group will export 23.41 million barrels a day during the period,
the Halifax, England-based consultant said today in a report.
The data exclude Ecuador and Angola.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 439,778 contracts as of 3:11
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 595,290
contracts yesterday, 15 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.39 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
