             Petroleos Mexicanos, Latin America’s
largest oil producer, said it had a 14.7-billion peso ($1.1
billion) foreign-exchange gain last year after the peso rallied.  
 The 2009 currency gains “were primarily the result of the
appreciation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, which
resulted in the opposite effect on the value of such debt,” the
Mexico City-based company said today in its 20-F annual filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 Pemex, as the state-owned oil company is known, reported
foreign exchange losses of 71.1 billion pesos in 2008 after the
Mexican currency had its steepest decline in 13 years in the
four months that followed the collapsed of Lehman Brothers in
September 2008. The peso gained more than 10 percent after
touching a record low in Jan. 30, 2009.
