             Transportation shares ,  semiconductor
makers  and  small companies  kept above a key level in last week’s
slump while broader indexes sank below it, a sign U.S. stocks
may resist further losses, Strategas Research Partners LLC said.  
 The Dow Jones Transportation Average stayed higher than its
200-day moving average, even as the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
sank below the barrier for a second time since May. The
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the Russell 2000 Index,
benchmarks for chipmakers and small companies, also ended the
week above their 200-day averages after the four-day decline,
which pushed the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  below the
threshold.  
 The three groups provide a “cyclical barometer of the
market strength” and the “positive divergence” suggested any
loss will be limited,  Chris Verrone , lead technical analyst at
Strategas, said in an interview.  
 “It’s pretty significant divergence,” said Verrone, who
studies charts of prices to predict changes in securities at
Strategas in New York. “The leadership profile is not
consistent with the bearish trend.”  
 The S&P 500 fell 3.7 percent last week, the most since May,
after new-home sales sank to a record low and the Federal
Reserve said European indebtedness may harm American growth.
Since its 2010 high in April, the benchmark has lost 12 percent.  
 The last divergence of the three groups with the overall
market preceded a recovery, according to Verrone. On May 25,
when the Industrial Average and the S&P 500 broke their Feb. 5
intraday lows, the three groups, which are more tied to economic
swings, did not. The market then bottomed on June 7, followed by
the biggest two-week rally since November.  
 Crossover  
 While Verrone says the bull market that began in March 2009
remains intact, others predict the trend is in danger after the
S&P 500 posted a negative  crossover  for the first time since
2007 while its weekly chart sent out another bearish signal.  
 The benchmark’s 50-day average yesterday crossed below its
150-day average, suggesting more losses may be in store,
according to Concept Capital. The S&P 500’s 50-day average
crossed above the 150-day average in May 2009, and the index
rallied 33 percent in the following 11 months.  
 The index last week exceeded the intraday highs and lows it
reached the previous week, a “negative reversal” that
indicates “overhanging selling pressure,” Raymond James
Financial Inc.’s  Art Huprich  said.  
 “Trends continue to deteriorate for U.S. equities,”  John Kolovos  and  Craig S. Peskin , co-heads of technical analysis
research at Concept Capital, wrote in a note yesterday.
“Whether or not equities are or will be in a bear market, the
change that is underway is an important development.”  
 Mary Ann Bartels , an analyst with Bank of America Corp.,
said the market will be in a “tug-o-war’ between 1,044.50 and
1,150, where the S&P 500 has been trading in the past six weeks.  
 “Below 1044.50, the bears win. Above 1150, the bulls
win,” Bartels wrote in a note yesterday. “In our view, the
risks are weighted in favor of a test and a likely break of
1044.50 in coming weeks.”
