             Treasuries rose, pushing two-year
note  yields  to a record low, on evidence of a slowing global
economic recovery and the expiration of a European Central Bank
lending facility.  
 Ten-year note  yields  dropped below 3 percent for the first
time in more than a year as U.S. consumer confidence fell this
month more than economists forecast and an index of China’s
leading economic indicators had its smallest gain in April in
five months. U.S. government bonds were headed for their best
quarter since the 2008 financial crisis.  
 “Bonds are saying this economy is getting bad,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “People are going
across the curve. They are buying for yield and capital
preservation.”  
 The  yield  on the two-year note fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 0.61 percent at 4:11 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 0.625
percent  security  maturing in June 2012 increased 1/32, or 31
cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100 1/32.  
 The two-year note’s yield slid earlier to the all-time low
of 0.5857 percent. The previous record of 0.6044 percent was set
Dec. 17, 2008, after the Fed cut its  target  rate for overnight
lending between banks to a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell to its 2010 closing
low, dropping 3.1 percent on the evidence of a slowdown in the
U.S. and China. The euro lost as much as 2.2 percent to 107.32
yen, the lowest level since November 2001. Crude oil for August
delivery fell 3.5 percent to $75.55 a barrel.  
 Consumer Sentiment  
 The Conference Board’s  index  of U.S. consumer confidence
fell to 52.9 in June from a revised 62.7 in the prior month. The
median forecast of 71 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a decrease to 62.5 from a previously reported 63.3. Figures
from the Labor Department later this week will show the nation
lost 115,000 jobs in June, according to the median forecast in a
separate survey.  
 “The market priced in too optimistic of a recovery, and
investors who were bearish are being forced to buy,” said
 Thomas Tucci , head of U.S. government bond trading in New York
at Royal Bank of Canada, one of 18 primary dealers that trade
directly with the Federal Reserve. “We are coming up on the
quarter-end.”  
 The U.S. House of Representatives voted today to give
homebuyers who qualified for a federal tax credit more time to
settle on pending purchases. The credit may have fueled a
temporary increase in home sales, which fell after the April
deadline passed.  
 Outlook for China  
 A gauge of China’s economic outlook compiled by the 
Conference Board rose 0.3 percent in April, less than the 1.7
percent gain it reported June 15. The New York-based group said
in an e-mailed statement that the previous reading contained a
calculation error for floor space on which construction began.  
 The 10-year note  yield  fell seven basis points to 2.95
percent, the lowest level since April 28, 2009. The 30-year bond
yield touched 3.93 percent, the least since Oct. 2, 2009.  
 U.S. government securities have returned 4.4 percent this
quarter, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, as
the 10-year yield plunged from its 2010 high of 4.01 percent
reached on April 5.  
 The last time Treasuries rallied as much was when they
gained 9 percent in the last three months of 2008 as credit
markets froze around the world following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in September of that year.  
 Europe’s Banks  
 The health of Europe’s banks may be revealed tomorrow when
the European Central Bank offers them three-month loans before
the expiration of a landmark 12-month facility.  
 Banks on July 1 need to repay 442 billion euros ($540
billion), the biggest amount ever awarded by the ECB and a major
part in its effort to contain the financial crisis. Demand for
three-month cash tomorrow will reveal how much banks still rely
on the ECB for funding, analysts said.  
 The added yield that investors demand to hold 10-year notes
instead of 2-year notes dropped to the  lowest level  since
October 2009. The difference, charted on the yield curve, fell
to 2.37 percentage points, the narrowest on a closing basis
since October 2009.  
 The government sold $36 billion in four-week Treasury bills
today at a rate of 0.150 percent, the highest since May 25. The
bid-to-cover ratio was 3.47, the lowest since a sale in August
2009, indicating weak demand as investors moved further out the
yield curve for higher-yielding Treasury maturities.  
 Portfolio Duration  
 Treasuries also rose as U.S. buyers sought to increase the
duration of portfolios to match their benchmarks at the end of
the second quarter.  
 Barclays Plc’s Treasury index is expected to extend by 0.06
year at the end of June, compared with 0.09 year for the month
of May, according to the firm, a primary dealer.  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange showed an 18 percent
chance the Fed will increase its target lending rate by at least
a quarter-percentage point by its December meeting, compared
with 36 percent odds a month ago.  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and Treasury
Inflation Protected  Securities , a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, was 1.87 percentage points, down from this
year’s high of 2.49 percentage points in January.  
 “There’s low inflation, and the economy is showing signs
of weakness,” said  Sean Murphy , Treasury trader in New York at
Societe Generale. “The market is telling you that the
deflationary theme is prevalent.”
