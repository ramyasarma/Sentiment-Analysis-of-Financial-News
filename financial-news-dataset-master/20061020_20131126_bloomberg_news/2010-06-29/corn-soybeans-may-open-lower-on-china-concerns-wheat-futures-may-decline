             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation that
economic growth in China is slowing, said  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
concern that Chinese demand for animal feed and vegetable oils
will decline, reducing U.S. exports, Gerlach said. Soybean-meal
futures may open 50 cents to $1.50 lower per 2,000 pounds, and
soybean oil is expected to fall 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as global inventories climb, Gerlach said.
