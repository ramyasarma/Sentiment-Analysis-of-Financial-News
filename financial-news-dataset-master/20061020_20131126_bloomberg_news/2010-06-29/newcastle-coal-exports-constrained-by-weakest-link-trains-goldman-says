             Coal shipments from Australia’s
Newcastle, the world’s biggest export harbor for the fuel used
in power stations, are limited by the capacity of trains to
carry the product to port, Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty said.  
 Trains on the network will be capable of transporting 123
million metric tons a year in 2012, compared with the 133
million-ton export capability of two terminals operated by Port
Waratah Coal Services, Goldman Sachs said in a note dated June
28. Capacity on the rail line will be 145 million tons.  
 “The coal chain is restricted by its weakest link and
currently trains are proving to be the constraint,” Goldman
Sachs analysts led by Melbourne-based  Neil Goodwill  said.
“Unless expansions to capacity of the rail and trains are able
to keep pace, the additional port capacity will not be of use.”  
 Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group, partly owned by BHP
Billiton Ltd., shipped its first cargo from the Australian port
in March after spending more than A$1 billion ($870 million) on
a third terminal at the harbor. Its export capacity is expected
to rise to 30 million tons in 2011.  
 Rio Tinto Group,  Xstrata Plc  and Peabody Energy Corp are
among mining companies that ship the fuel from Newcastle. The
volume exported in the week ended 7 a.m. local time June 21
climbed to 2.04 million metric tons from 1.66 million tons in
the preceding period, Newcastle Port Corp. said on its website.
