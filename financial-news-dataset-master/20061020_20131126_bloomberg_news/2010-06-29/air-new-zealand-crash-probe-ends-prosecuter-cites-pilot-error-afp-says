             The 2008 crash of an  Air New Zealand
Ltd.  plane into the Mediterranean Sea off southern France, which
killed seven people, was due to pilot error and won’t lead to a
criminal case, Agence France-Presse said today.  
 The manslaughter investigation found the crew’s loss of
control, not malfunctioning flight monitors on the Airbus A320,
caused the crash and so no indictments will come from the probe,
AFP reported, citing the deputy prosecutor in Perpignan, France.
