             Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, said its board approved allowing
minority investors to use Treasury bonds as payment for new
shares in a planned $25 billion offering.  
 Details on what types of debt can be used to buy stock will
be released at “the right time,” the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. Petrobras, as the oil
producer is known, said it is giving minority shareholders the
same “treatment” as the government, the company said.  
 Brazil’s government, which owns  56 percent  of the company’s
voting stock, plans to buy shares with bonds. As part of the
transaction, Petrobras will then sell the bonds back to the
government in exchange for as much as 5 billion barrels of
deepwater oil reserves. Petrobras is issuing new shares to help
finance $224 billion in investments through 2014 to boost oil
production and expand its refining capacity.  
 Petrobras is “protecting itself against any legal
questioning of the deal, seeing that the government will do
their transaction with bonds,” said Marcelo Mollica, who helps
oversee about $2 billion in assets at GAP Asset Management in
Rio de Janeiro.  
 Mollica said minority shareholders will most likely buy
shares with cash, set for September. Petrobras has estimated it
will raise as much as $25 billion from minority shareholders.
