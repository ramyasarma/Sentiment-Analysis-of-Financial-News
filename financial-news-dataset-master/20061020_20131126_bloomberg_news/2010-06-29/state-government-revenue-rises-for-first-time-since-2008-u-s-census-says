             State government tax revenue
increased during the first three months of the year for the
first time since 2008 on higher income tax collections,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  
 The revenue rose $4 billion, or 2.7 percent, to $164.5
billion in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to
Census Bureau  figures released today . State and local government
revenue combined rose 0.8 percent from the year-ago period to
$299 billion, the second straight quarterly increase. State
income tax receipts climbed $1.3 billion to $53.2 billion.  
 U.S. state and local governments raised taxes and cut
spending to make up for lost revenue in the worst recession
since the 1930s.  
 The Census figures are similar to first-quarter statistics
released earlier this month by the Rockefeller Institute of
Government. The Albany, New York-based organization attributed
the boost in state collections to tax increases adopted in
California and New York, and said early indications showed
revenue declined in April, the month most individuals file
income tax returns.  
 After cuts to spending on schools, health care and other
programs, U.S. states are still expected to have $127 billion
less than they need to pay all of their bills through 2012,
according to the  National Governors Association.   
 Property tax collections dropped in the first quarter for
the first time since the onset of the real-estate market’s
crash, to $107.7 billion from $108.4 billion a year earlier,
according to the Census Bureau. Corporate taxes also declined.
