             Teck Resources Ltd.  said it won’t
know until this week how much output of metallurgical coal will
be reduced by an explosion and fire at one of the company’s
mines in Canada.  
 The coal dryer at the Greenhills mine near Elkford, British
Columbia, suffered “fairly extensive” damage in yesterday’s
incident,  Greg Waller , a spokesman for the Vancouver-based
company, said today in a telephone interview. Teck has an 80
percent stake in the mine.  
 “It’s going to take some time to assess the impact on
production,” Waller said. “We may not know until Friday.”  
 Teck is reviewing alternatives including trucking coal from
Greenhills to nearby mines that may not be using their coal
dryers at full capacity, he said.  
 Teck had forecast the mine to produce about 4.3 million
metric tons of metallurgical coal this year, of which Teck’s
share is about 3.4 million tons, the company said in a
statement. Pohang, South Korea-based Posco owns the remaining 20
percent.  
 “We expect the impact of Greenhills to have a negligible
impact on the global coal market,” which is approximately 220
million to 240 million tons,  Greg Barnes , a Toronto-based
 analyst  with TD Newcrest Securities, said today in a note to
clients.  
 Coal  accounted for 46 percent of the company’s C$7.67
billion ($7.28 billion) in sales last year.  
 Teck slid C$1.91, or 5.7 percent, to C$31.77 at 4:16 p.m.
in Toronto Stock Exchange  trading . The shares have fallen 14
percent this year.
