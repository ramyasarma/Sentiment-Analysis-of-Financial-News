             South Africa, the world’s biggest
producer of platinum and chrome, will announce details of a new
mining industry strategy tomorrow, the Mineral Resources
Ministry said.  
 The government, business and labor will sign the Mining
Industry Strategy for Sustainable Growth and Meaningful
Transformation accord in Pretoria, the Ministry said in an e-
mailed statement late yesterday.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , Anglo
American Plc, Rio Tinto Ltd. and Xstrata Plc have mines in South
Africa.  
 The government started a review of its current mining
industry strategy, the so-called Mining Charter, last year. The
2004 charter requires mining companies to ensure 15 percent of
their South African assets were held by black investors by 2009
and 26 percent by 2014 to make amends for apartheid, which ended
in 1994.  
 South Africa’s mining industry has missed targets set out
in the 2004 strategy and hasn’t “lived up to the spirit and
intent of the charter,” Mineral Resources Minister  Susan Shabangu  said in November.
