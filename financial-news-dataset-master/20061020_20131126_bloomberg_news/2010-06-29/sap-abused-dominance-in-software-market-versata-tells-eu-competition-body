             SAP AG , the world’s biggest maker of
business-management software, abused its dominant position,
Versata Software Inc. said in a complaint to the European
Union’s competition regulator.  
 Versata, based in Austin, Texas, accuses SAP of forcing its
price-calculating software called Pricer out of the market by
refusing to give information that would allow it to work with
SAP products. Versata also claims Walldorf, Germany-based SAP
cloned Pricer and combined it with other SAP products so that
its clients wouldn’t buy Pricer.  
 “This is an egregious breach of competition law,”  Thomas Vinje , a lawyer at  Clifford Chance LLP  representing Versata,
said in an interview in Brussels today.  
 SAP, which said it would acquire Dublin, California-based
 Sybase Inc.  May 12 to help it fend off competition from  Oracle
Corp. , was found to have violated Versata’s patents by a jury in
Marshal, Texas last year. The jury ordered SAP to pay Versata
$138.6 million.  
 The  European Commission , the executive arm of the European
Union, can reject complaints if it decides there isn’t enough
evidence of anti-competitive behavior. Vinje, who represented
Oracle in its bid to win approval to acquire Sun Microsystems
Inc., said the SAP complaint was filed today.
