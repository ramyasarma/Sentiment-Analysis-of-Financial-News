             India’s stocks fell the most in
three weeks after the central bank’s deputy governor said
interest rates may be raised “any time” as the government
allowed fuel prices to increase.  
 ICICI Bank Ltd. , the country’s second-biggest lender,
dropped 2.5 percent. Jaiprakash Associates Ltd., a power plant
builder, dropped 2.8 percent. Deputy Governor  K.C. Chakrabarty 
yesterday said in Mumbai that borrowing costs may be increased
before or in a July 27 monetary policy meeting. The inflation
rate may climb by almost a percentage point after gasoline and
diesel prices were allowed to rise, the finance ministry
forecast on June 26.  
 “An inflationary environment spooks equity markets,” said
 Sadanand Shetty , who manages $75 million in equities at Taurus
Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. “We could see an inter-policy
action by the Reserve Bank of India.” He said interest rates
may be raised by as much as 50 basis points by the end of next
month.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 240.17, or 1.4 percent, to 17,534.09. The gauge dropped the
most since June 7 and is little changed this quarter. The S&P
CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost 1.5 percent
to 5,256.15. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 1.2 percent to 2,229.56.  
 ICICI Bank declined 2.5 percent to 848.3 rupees.  HDFC Bank
Ltd.,  the third-biggest lender, lost 2.4 percent to 1,904.4
rupees.  Jaiprakash  decreased 2.8 percent to 128.05 rupees. Tata
Motors Ltd., India’s biggest truckmaker, lost 2.3 percent to
770.95 rupees.  
 Policy Meeting  
 “The possibility of a rate hike is always there,”
Chakrabarty said. “ It can probably happen before” the next
monetary policy meeting.  
 Reserve Bank Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao , who has raised
interest rates twice since mid-March, said June 18 he would
tighten monetary policy in a “calibrated” manner, given the
cash squeeze in the economy and risks to growth posed by
Europe’s debt woes. India’s benchmark whole-sale  inflation  index
rose 10.16 percent in May.  
 “The prospect of an interest rate increase is like a
hanging sword,” said  Kishor Ostwal , managing director of CNI
Research (India) Ltd., a publicly traded equities research
provider in Mumbai. “Traders are hesitant to take fresh
positions.” He advises investors to avoid shares of banks, real
estate companies and automakers.  
 Metal Prices Drop  
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the largest copper and
zinc producer, lost 1.4 percent to 167.45 rupees.  Hindalco
Industries Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer, sank 4.3 percent
to 144.2 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest producer of the
alloy, plunged 3.7 percent to 481.6 rupees. Jindal Steel & Power
Ltd., the nation’s second-biggest producer by market value,
retreated 2.6 percent to 621.2 rupees.  
 Copper and zinc fell the most in three weeks, leading
declines in commodities, on concern that growth in China, the
world’s largest consumer of all industrial metals, will slow.  
 Copper lost as much as 4.2 percent and zinc dropped 5.1
percent, the biggest declines since June 4.  The Shanghai
Composite Index  ended the day at its lowest in 14 months, after
the Conference Board revised down its April gauge for China’s
economic outlook to indicate a weaker expansion.  
 Overseas  funds  sold a net  2.84 billion rupees  ($61 million)
of Indian equities on June 25, paring their investments in the
stocks this year to 303.7 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 BGR Energy Systems Ltd.  (BGRL IN) gained 4.6 percent to
741.35 rupees. The maker of equipment for power, oil and
petrochemical industries was rated “buy” in new coverage by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by  Ishan Sethi , who said
the company will be a “key participant” in the growth in power
generation construction in India.  
 IndusInd Bank Ltd.  (IIB IN) increased 2.5 percent to 205.6
rupees. The lender will raise 10 billion rupees by selling
shares this financial year, the Economic Times reported, citing
two people familiar with the matter. The money may be raised by
selling shares to institutions or by issue of global depository
receipts, according to the report.  
 IndusInd Bank’s Managing Director  Romesh Sobti  wasn’t
immediately available to comment when called at his office.  
 GTL Infrastructure Ltd.  (GTLI IN) climbed 1.3 percent to
47.7 rupees. Saudi Telecom Co. may buy a 10 percent to 15
percent stake in the venture created after Reliance Infratel
Ltd., a unit of Reliance Communications Ltd., and GTL
Infrastructure Ltd. merged this week, Business Standard reported,
citing people it didn’t identify. GTL spokesman  Vikas Arora  said
the company doesn’t comment on speculation.  
 Tata Chemicals Ltd.  (TTCH IN) advanced 1.7 percent to
332.45 rupees. The world’s second-largest soda ash producer led
gains among Indian producers after the government imposed a 16
percent duty on imports from China. GHCL Ltd. (GHCL IN) gained
1.5 percent to 49.55 rupees.
