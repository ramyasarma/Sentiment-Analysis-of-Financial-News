             Oat futures fell for a sixth
session, the longest slide since March, as a dry spell in Canada
boosted prospects for the crop, after two months of unusually
heavy rain prevented seeding and threatened to curb yields.  
 The Canadian Wheat Board, the nation’s biggest grain
marketer, said yesterday that crop conditions improved with
“much-needed warmth” in provinces including Saskatchewan. As
much as 12.5 million acres may be left fallow because of
excessive moisture, the CWB said. Canada is the biggest producer
after Russia.  
 “It’s a pretty rough day for the oats market,” said  Chad 
Henderson, a market analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants
in Brookfield, Wisconsin. “The bullish news of the acreage from
Canada has become old news.”  
 Oat futures for December delivery fell 9.5 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $2.53 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
touching $2.5275, the lowest price for the most-active contract
since June 18.  
 Oats are up 32 percent this month on concern that the wet
weather the past two months will damage the crop. Prices touched
a five-month high of $2.84 on June 23.
