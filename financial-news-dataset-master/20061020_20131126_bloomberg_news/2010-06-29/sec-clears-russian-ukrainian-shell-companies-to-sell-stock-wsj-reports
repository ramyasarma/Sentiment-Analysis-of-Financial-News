             The U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission has in the past two years cleared nine “shell” 
companies headed by people in Russia or Ukraine to sell stock 
to the public, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing public 
records at the regulator.  
 The SEC approved the companies, which had no revenue or 
activities and minimal assets, without asking any questions, 
the newspaper said.  
 Business plans included renting bicycles in Kiev and 
selling cars in Siberia, the Journal said, adding that all the 
companies used the same law firm, Dean Law Corp. of Seattle, to
help them with their initial filings.  
 The SEC declined to comment on reviews of individual 
companies, the newspaper said.
