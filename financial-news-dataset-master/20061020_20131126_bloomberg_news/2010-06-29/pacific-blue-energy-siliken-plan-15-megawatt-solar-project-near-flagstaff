                  June 28 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) --  Pacific Blue
Energy Corp.  and Spanish solar panel manufacturer Siliken
Renewable Energy have agreed to build a 15 megawatt solar
power project near Flagstaff, Arizona.  
 The pair will submit a bid to utility  Arizona Public
Service  to develop the Sunshine Solar Farm project on land
owned by Pacific Blue about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east
of Flagstaff in Coconino County, Pacific Blue said in a
statement on PR Newswire. Financing details were not provided.  
 Pacific Blue will use Siliken photovoltaic modules for
the project, which will be located within a half mile of a 69
kilovolt transmission line.  
 The site can support up to 20 megawatts of solar
electricity generation. A megawatt is equivalent to 1 million
watts of electricity and can power between 180 and 350 homes
per year, depending on usage patterns, according to the
statement.  
 Arizona Public Service filed with utilities regulator
Arizona Corporation Commission in March 2010 to buy power from
another proposed 15 megawatt solar project on the premises of
a mine near Bagdad in Yavapai County, Arizona. The Bagdad Mine
Solar 1 project would sell power to Arizona Public Service
under a 25-year power purchase agreement.  
 Separately, Pacific Blue said in a statement on June 25
it will team up with Patriot Solar Inc. to develop commercial
solar power farms in the Southwest U.S. It didn’t give further
details.
