             Daihatsu Motor Co. , 51 percent owned
by Toyota Motor Corp., plans to introduce a minicar model that
gets as much mileage as some gasoline-electric hybrids to meet
demand from fuel-conscious buyers.  
 A version of the Osaka, Japan-based carmaker’s e:S concept
car, which gets as much as 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) per liter,
will be introduced in Japan next year and may also be sold later
in emerging markets overseas, Daihatsu’s President  Koichi Ina 
said in an interview in Tokyo on June 21.  
 The gasoline-powered  e:S  already matches the fuel
efficiency of Honda Motor Co.’s Insight hybrid, while trailing
behind Toyota Prius’s performance. The Prius, Japan’s best-
selling model in the year ended March, gets as much as 38
kilometers per liter.  
 “Establishing this low-cost fuel-efficient technology is
our top priority,” Ina said. “We’ll then expand that into
emerging markets.”  
 Currently, the carmaker’s most fuel-efficient model is the
Mira minicar, which gets as much as 26 kilometers per liter and
is priced from 885,000 yen ($9,900). Minicars are powered by
engines no larger than 0.66 liters.  
 Daihatsu’s biggest market outside Japan is Southeast Asia,
where  sales  surged 46 percent to 44,946 vehicles in the first
five months of the year. Sales in the Middle East grew 25
percent from a year earlier to 9,162.  
 Japan’s largest minicar maker is expanding its parts
procurement to include more overseas suppliers, particularly in
Southeast Asia and China, Ina said.  
 The carmaker has a  goal of cutting component costs  30
percent by March 2012 from September 2009, Ina said. To help
meet that target, Daihatsu has added 13 suppliers, three of them
overseas, he said. The suppliers now total 390, according to the
company.  
 Ina, 62, was approved yesterday as president at Daihatsu’s
shareholders meeting after serving a year as executive vice
president. He spent 36 years at Toyota, most recently as
managing director specializing in production processes.
