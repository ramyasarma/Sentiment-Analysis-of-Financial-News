             Ukraine is seeking closer
cooperation with Russia to help industrial companies attract
investments and improve their access to world markets,
Industrial Policy Minister Dmytro Kolesnikov said.  
 “Cooperation with Russia in aviation, the defense industry
and energy equipment building will help Ukraine become a more
important player on world markets,” he said at a press
conference in Kiev today. “Ukrainian know-how in aviation has to
unite with the large Russian market and Russian investments.”  
 Ukraine has focused on improving relations with Russia
since President  Viktor Yanukovych  took office in February and
formed a cabinet loyal to him in March. Two months ago in Kiev,
Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  offered to merge OAO
Gazprom and NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy, the countries’ gas monopolies,
and to form a joint nuclear energy holding company.  
 The governments are also working to set up a fifty-fifty
joint venture of Russia’s United Aircraft Corp and Ukrainian
state aviation company Antonov OKB, Kolesnikov said. The new
company will do sales, marketing and service aircraft, he said.
Merging assets isn’t being discussed, according to Kolesnikov  
 Ukraine is also seeking a Russian partner for companies
including VAT  Turboatom , its biggest turbine maker, he said,
adding that joint projects are also possible in shipbuilding.
