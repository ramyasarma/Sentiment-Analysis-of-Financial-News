             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 2 basis points to
131 basis points as of 9.54 a.m. in Sydney, according to Nomura
Holdings Inc. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan rose 3 basis points to 135 basis
points as of 8:21 a.m. in Singapore, Credit Agricole CIB prices
show.  
 The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 0.5 basis point to
129.5 as of 8:56 a.m. in Tokyo, Morgan Stanley prices show.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
