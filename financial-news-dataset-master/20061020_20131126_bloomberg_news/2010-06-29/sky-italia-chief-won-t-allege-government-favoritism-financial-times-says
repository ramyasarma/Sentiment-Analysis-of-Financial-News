             Tom Mockridge, chief executive 
officer of Sky Italia Srl, refused to be drawn into making 
accusations that competitor Mediaset SpA, controlled by Italian
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, gets unfair support from the 
government, the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  
 Various government moves, including doubling the rate of 
value-added tax on pay television, have hit Sky Italia, News 
Corp.’s Italian satellite broadcasting unit, harder than 
Mediaset, the FT said. Mockridge said he would not level an 
accusation of conflict of interest in the decisions, the 
newspaper said.
