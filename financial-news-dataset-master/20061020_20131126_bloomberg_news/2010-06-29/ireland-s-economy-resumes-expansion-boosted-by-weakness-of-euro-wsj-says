             Ireland is likely to announce 
tomorrow that its economy grew in the first quarter of the 
year, helped by the weak euro, the Wall Street Journal reported.  
 Economists say Ireland may see growth of 0.5 or 0.6 percent
this year, according to the newspaper.   
 While many eurozone countries’ exports go mainly to other 
countries in the currency bloc, Ireland sells chemicals, 
business services, technology and food to the U.S. and Britain,
so it’s benefiting from the euro’s 15 percent decline against 
the dollar and its 8 percent drop against the British pound 
since the start of the year, the Journal said.
