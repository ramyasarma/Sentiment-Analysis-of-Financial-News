             Wheat futures fell to a two-week low
after a U.S. Department of Agriculture  report  showed dry weather
allowed farmers to accelerate the harvest in the southern Great
Plains and Midwest.  
 Collection of winter wheat in Kansas and Oklahoma, the
biggest U.S. producers of the varieties, and from Arkansas to
Ohio was 38 percent complete as of June 27, up from 17 percent a
week earlier, the USDA said yesterday. In Kansas, 55 percent was
collected, up from 10 percent. The U.S. is the world’s biggest
wheat exporter.  
 “There definitely would be some harvest pressure
involved,” said  Dan Manternach , the director of agriculture
services at Doane Advisory Services in St. Louis. Prices that
fell 2.6 percent in the previous two sessions prompted hedge-
fund managers “to add to their short positions and index funds
to sell some of their long positions,” he said.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 8 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $4.57 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price touched $4.55, the lowest level since June
11. The commodity has dropped 16 percent this year amid an
increase in global inventories.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
