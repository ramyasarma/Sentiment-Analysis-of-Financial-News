             Greece is facing an insolvency
crisis and an orderly restructuring of its public debt is
required in order to avoid an “inevitable default,” New York
University professor Nouriel Roubini writes in the Financial
Times.  
 Austerity measures agreed as a condition of the country’s
bailout by the European Union and International Monetary Fund
will prolong Greece’s recession and still leave it with a debt-
to-gross-domestic-product ratio of 148 percent by 2016, he
writes.  
 Support from the IMF does not prevent an eventual default
and can cause greater damage when the country is insolvent,
Roubini writes in the newspaper. A preemptive restructuring
would also limit losses for European institutions, he writes.
