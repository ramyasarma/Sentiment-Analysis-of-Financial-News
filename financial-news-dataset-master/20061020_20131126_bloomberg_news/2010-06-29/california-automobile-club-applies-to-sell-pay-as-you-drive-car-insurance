             Automobile Club of Southern
California , a drivers’ group in the U.S. state with the most
cars, submitted the second  application  to offer insurance in
which motorists get discounts for traveling less.  
 The filing for pay-as-you-drive coverage is being reviewed
along with an earlier request by State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co., California Insurance Commissioner  Steve Poizner 
said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 Pay-as-you-drive coverage allows companies to track miles
traveled and other data about driving habits, to help set policy
prices. Poizner, a Republican, approved the coverage in October.
State Farm, the largest U.S. car insurer, was the first to apply
in May.  
 The program allows “insurers to offer plans based on more
accurate mileage,” Poizner said in the statement. “People who
choose to drive less will pay less for auto insurance.”
