             New Zealand’s central bank will
continue unwinding monetary policy stimulus as the domestic
economy recovers, Governor  Alan Bollard  said.  
 The nation has emerged from its recession, benefiting from
stronger growth in its major trading partners, he said in a
statement today when releasing the annual  Statement of Intent .
Recovery remains sluggish in the U.K. and Europe, and sovereign
debt concerns hovering over several European economies are
disturbing financial markets, he said.  
 The comments echo those made in the monetary policy
statement on June 10 when Bollard raised the  official cash rate 
a quarter-point to 2.75 percent, the first increase in three
years. The central bank said that it expected to raise borrowing
costs gradually as the economy recovers and would be monitoring
turbulence in global funding markets.  
 “While we have unwound most of the emergency liquidity
support provided to the financial system during the financial
crisis, our facilities remain under review given current
volatility in global markets,” Bollard said today. There are
almost daily reminders that conditions remain fragile,
especially in global funding markets, he said.  
 Bollard said the central bank is confident that medium-term
price stability is the right objective for monetary policy.
Still, it will continue to investigate the potential for macro-
prudential policy tools to help support the traditional cash
rate, he said.
