             Italy’s  FTSE MIB Index  lost 566.58,
or 2.8 percent, to 19,564.03 as of 1:21 p.m. in Milan, the
lowest intraday level since June 11.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Buzzi Unicem SpA  (BZU IM) and  Italcementi SpA  (IT IM),
Italy’s biggest cement makers, lost 3.1 percent to 8.4 euros and
2.7 percent to 6.43 euros, respectively.  
 Investor sentiment worsened today after the Conference
Board said its China leading economic index rose 0.3 percent in
April, less than the 1.7 percent gain reported June 15. China’s
exports face “strong headwinds” in the second half of the year
from policy-tightening measures and the European debt crisis,
Citigroup Inc. said in a report.  
 Fiat SpA  (F IM) fell 30.5 cents, or 3.4 percent, to 8.73
euros, erasing yesterday’s increase. Shares of tiremaker  Pirelli
& C. SpA  (PC IM) declined 2.6 percent to 46.35 euro cents.  
 Eni SpA  (ENI IM), Italy’s biggest oil company, dropped 43
cents, or 2.7 percent, to 15.27 euros. Crude fell for a second
day in New York on speculation a tropical storm will bypass oil
fields in the Gulf of Mexico, and on concern China’s economy is
growing at a slower pace than estimated.  
 I Grandi Viaggi SpA  (IGV IM) lost 1.1 euro cents, or 1.2
percent, to 90 cents, a fourth consecutive decline, as the
Italian tour operator reported a first-half loss of 4.47 million
euros ($5.47 million).  
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM) sank 9 cents, or 3.9 percent,
to 2.23 euros, a second day of losses. Credit Suisse Group AG
downgraded Italy’s second-biggest bank to “neutral” from
“outperform.” The brokerage said in a note it doesn’t see “a
stock rerating in the near term as likely.”  
 Saipem SpA  (SPM IM) retreated 88 cents, or 3.3 percent, to
25.67 euros. Europe’s largest oil services provider said it is
reassessing how long it will take to build the Scarabeo 8
drilling rig after a fire at the Fincantieri shipyard in Palermo
on June 24, according to a statement on the Italian exchange.  
 UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM), Italy’s biggest bank, lost 5.7
cents, or 3 percent, to 1.88 euros. Gruppo Banca Leonardo, which
has an “underweight’” rating on the stock, noted that “the only
Italian bank present in Kazakhstan is UniCredit with ATF Bank.”
Fitch Ratings said the deterioration in the health of Kazakh
banks has yet to be significantly reversed.  
 Unione di Banche Italiane ScpA  (UBI IM) declined 20.5
cents, or 2.7 percent, to 7.24 euros, ending a two-day increase.
Credit Suisse trimmed its price estimate on the stock to 8.8
euros from 9.1 euros and kept an “underperform” rating.
