             Bank Rossii First Deputy Chairman
Alexei Ulyukayev warned of volatility in the ruble’s exchange
rate, saying the recent period when the Russian currency only
strengthened is “over.”  
 The disparity in interest rates between emerging and
developed economies boosts demand for “carry trades” and
complicates efforts by regulators to battle “hot money
inflows,” Ulyukayev said at a Renaissance Capital conference in
Moscow today. He said he agreed with Finance Minister Alexei
Kudrin’s remark that the ruble has a 50-50 chance of weakening
or strengthening.
