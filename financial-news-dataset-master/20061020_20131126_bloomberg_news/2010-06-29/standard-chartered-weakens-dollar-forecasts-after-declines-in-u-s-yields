             Standard Chartered Plc lowered its
forecasts for the U.S. dollar versus the yen and the Swiss
franc, citing a “powerful rally” in Treasuries that narrowed
the premium offered by U.S. rates.  
 The extra yield investors get from 10-year Treasuries over
similar Japanese bonds dropped to the lowest since May 2009
after a U.S. report yesterday showed inflation remains muted and
Group of 20 nations leaders agreed over the weekend on a target
for cutting budget deficits. The Swiss franc yesterday climbed
to a record versus the euro as a member of the nation’s central
bank said deflationary tensions “practically disappeared.”  
 “There’s not a powerful reason anymore to move out of
holding long JGBs into long-term Treasuries,” said  Robert Minikin , a senior foreign-exchange strategist in Hong Kong at
Standard Chartered. “The appetite for the Swiss National Bank
to intervene to weaken the Swiss franc has clearly been
substantially diluted and that is supportive for the franc.”  
 The dollar will advance to 93.5 yen in the third quarter
and 95 yen by year-end, the bank said today, trimming a previous
estimate for the U.S. currency to reach 98 yen and 100 yen
respectively. The greenback will buy 1.19 francs by Sept. 30 and
1.17 by December, rather than 1.25 and 1.23 as earlier forecast,
according to the report.  
 The U.S. currency fell 0.5 percent to 88.94 yen as of 12:46
p.m. in Tokyo, compared with yesterday in New York, and traded
at 1.0874 Swiss francs.  
 Demand for the yen and Swiss franc has been bolstered as
measures of market volatility, such as the VIX index, remain
elevated, Minikin said. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is
poised for an 8.1 percent retreat since March 31, snapping a
four-quarter streak of gains.  
 “Market conditions remain very uncertain and jittery and
that’s keeping model-based buyers of high-yield crosses like
Aussie-yen on the sidelines,” he said.
