             The Swiss franc may extend gains
that pushed it to a record against the euro amid speculation the
risk of fueling inflation will discourage the central bank from
selling the currency, Commerzbank AG said.  
 Growth in money supply during May was “notable” and if
the Swiss National Bank “continued its intervention this effect
could be enhanced, causing medium-term inflation risks,”
analysts led by Frankfurt-based  Ulrich Leuchtmann  wrote in a
note to clients today.  
 “The recovery in Switzerland is continuing so that the
risk of deflation is hardly worth mentioning now,” he said.
“As a result the downtrend in euro-franc is therefore likely to
continue.”  
 The franc rose for a fourth day against the euro and was
0.5 percent stronger at 1.3284 as of 8:58 a.m. in London, the
first time it has strengthened to less than 1.33 since the 16-
nation currency’s 1999 debut.
