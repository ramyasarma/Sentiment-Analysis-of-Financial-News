             Britain sold 8 billion pounds ($12
billion) of a new 30-year bond through banks, its biggest
syndicated sale ever, priced at the lowest yield in the target
range as investors sought the safety of government securities.  
 The sale of 4.25 percent December 2040 bonds in pounds was
priced to yield 1 basis point more than 2039  gilts , or at the
equivalent yield of 4.243 percent. Investors placed orders worth
13.8 billion pounds for the security, bankers involved in the
deal said. The sale’s so-called guidance price was set at range
between 1 to 3 basis points above the 2039 gilt’s level.  
 The level of demand may indicate investors are concerned
about a slowing world economy and are more willing to buy
British debt in the wake of government spending cuts last week,
according to  Robin Marshall , a director of fixed income at Smith
& Williamson Investment Management in London. German benchmark
bonds rose today, pushing the yield on 10-year securities to a
three-week low, while stock markets sank around the world.  
 “I can see it as a case for a deflation hedge for some
investors given what’s going on in Europe,” Marshall said of
today’s offering.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s emergency
budget helped to lower gilt sales for this fiscal year to 165
billion pounds from 185.2 billion pounds envisaged in April.
That followed an unprecedented 227.6 billion pounds of bond
sales in the previous 12 months.  
 Supply Concern  
 “Concern earlier this year about a supply glut has also
eased after the government cut spending, resulting in a
reduction on gilt issuance,” Marshall said. “These are
positive backdrops for this long-dated bond sale.”  
 The sale was managed by Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley,
Nomura Holdings Inc. and RBC Capital Markets.  
 Gilts stayed higher after the sale, with the yield on the
4.25 percent gilt maturing in September 2039 two basis points
lower on the day at 4.22 percent as of 3:10 p.m. in London.  
 Today’s sale is the first so-called syndicated offering of
U.K. regular bonds for the fiscal year starting April, the Debt
Management Office said. There has already been a syndication of
inflation-linked debt.  
 “Today has seen the largest syndicated gilt offering by
the Debt Management Office to date,”  Robert Stheeman , the
agency’s chief executive officer, said in an e-mailed note.
“The transaction has shown once again the high quality demand
from our core domestic investor base for long-dated conventional
gilts.”  
 Gilts with maturities longer than 10 years outperformed
shorter-dated securities, handing investors a 6.04 percent
return compared with a 5.23 percent from bonds which are due
within 10 years, according to indexes compiled by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.
