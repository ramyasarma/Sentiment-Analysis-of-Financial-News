             Copper, aluminum, zinc, lead and
nickel slumped on the London Metal Exchange as Asian stock
markets declined on concern tightening measures in China and the
European debt crisis may slow the global economic recovery.  
 Copper for three-month delivery tumbled as much as 2.3
percent to $6,711 a ton before trading at $6,760 a ton. Aluminum
fell as much as 1.4 percent to $2,000 a ton before trading at
$2,011, and zinc dropped as much as 2.5 percent to $1,833 a ton
before trading at $1,838. Lead lost 3 percent to $1,805 a ton
and nickel shed 2.2 percent to $20,200 a ton.
