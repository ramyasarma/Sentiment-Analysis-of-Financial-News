             U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  earmarked 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) to help
companies in areas of the U.K. that will be hardest hit by the
cuts in public spending announced in an emergency budget last
week.  
 “The Regional Growth Fund will create the conditions for
growth and enterprise in the regions by stimulating investment
and create sustainable private sector jobs,” Clegg said in a
statement released by his office today.
