             The U.S. House plans to try again
today to approve legislation extending  unemployment  benefits
after a measure to do so was blocked yesterday because of its
cost.  
 The  vote  on the $33 billion measure was 261 in favor and
155 against, with a two-thirds majority needed for passage under
the expedited procedure used by Democratic leaders to limit
debate.  
 House Republican leaders urged opposition to the bill
because it lacked provisions to pay for its cost. Voting no were
139 Republicans and 16 Democrats; supporting the measure were
231 Democrats and 30 Republicans.  
 The bill would continue jobless aid through November, with
benefits provided retroactively to the more than 1 million
Americans whose weekly checks have been stopped during recent
congressional dickering over a larger bill that included
restoration of the aid.  
 House Ways and Means Committee Chairman  Sander Levin , a
Michigan Democrat, said the chamber would take up the separate
unemployment-assistance measure today under regular rules
requiring a simple majority for approval. “It will pass,”
Levin told reporters after yesterday’s vote.  
 Representative  Dave Camp , the top Republican on the Ways
and Means panel, was among those objecting to the bill’s price
tag. “It isn’t right to simply add the cost of this spending to
our already overdrawn  national credit card ,” he said.  
 Deficit Concerns  
 The measure was broken out of the more sweeping tax-and-
spending measure blocked last week by Senate Republicans, who
said it would have added too much to the  deficit . Since then,
Senator  Olympia Snowe , a Maine Republican, has called for
passing a standalone jobless measure.  
 Under the House bill, the unemployed would see their checks
shrink by $25, to an average $310, after lawmakers opted not to
extend provisions in last year’s economic stimulus package
providing a bonus payment. The bill wouldn’t extend aid to the
growing number of Americans who have exhausted all of their
allowable assistance. It would only revive expired provisions
offering up to 99 weeks of aid.  
 The bill is H.R. 5618.

                          June 30 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, discusses his opposition to the Democrats' strategy to finance the U.S. financial regulation bill. 
     Democratic lawmakers cleared the way for final votes in the House and Senate on the U.S. financial-regulatory bill after reconvening to make a fix requested by Republican senators, who objected to charging banks and hedge funds $19 billion to help pay for the measure.
