             Alan Howard , co-founder of Brevan
Howard Asset Management LLP, Europe’s biggest hedge-fund firm,
has moved to Switzerland from the U.K., according to a filing.  
 Howard, 46, is working in the firm’s Geneva office and
continues to oversee the Brevan Howard Master Fund, the company
said in a statement today with the London Stock Exchange.
 Anthony Payne , a spokesman for the firm, confirmed the release
and declined to comment further.  
 Switzerland has attracted some of London’s top financial
professionals after the U.K. government raised a levy on non-
domiciled workers and announced plans to lift income taxes for
top earners. BlueCrest Capital Management Ltd., Europe’s third-
largest hedge-fund firm, has opened a Geneva office for as many
as 70 traders and analysts who have worked in London on its two
biggest funds.  
 Brevan Howard, which manages more than $30 billion, has
rented office space in Geneva for traders relocating from
London. The firm, which also has operations in Hong Kong and New
York, announced plans for a Swiss office last year and said at
that time it had no intention of moving its London operations
elsewhere.  
 The U.K. tax increase, which went into effect on April 6,
pushed the top tax rate above those in Germany and France for
the first time since 1989. London’s highest earners must now pay
a 50 percent tax on incomes above 150,000 pounds ($226,000),
replacing a 40 percent top rate.
