             Defending champion Serena Williams
beat China’s Li Na in straight sets at Wimbledon today to reach
the semifinals at the only tennis Grand Slam played on grass.  
 The 28-year-old American, who secured her 12th Grand Slam
title at this year’s Australian Open, won 7-5, 6-3 on Centre
Court.  
 Williams also won the Wimbledon title in 2002 and 2003, and
is a two-time runnerup.
