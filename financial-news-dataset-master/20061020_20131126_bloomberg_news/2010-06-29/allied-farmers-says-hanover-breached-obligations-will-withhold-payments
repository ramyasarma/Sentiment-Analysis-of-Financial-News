             Allied Farmers Ltd., which last year
agreed to buy the finance assets of New Zealand’s Hanover
Finance Ltd., said it will withhold a NZ$5 million payment and
may take action against Hanover directors and officers.  
 Hanover’s conduct in the period prior to completion of the
transaction constituted serious breaches of its obligations,
Allied said in a statement.
