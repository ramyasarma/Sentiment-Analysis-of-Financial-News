             Brazil’s government may sell bonds
in international bond markets for the first time in more than
two months, Treasury Secretary  Arno Augustin  said.  
 The government may tap the market in the coming weeks,
Augustin told reporters in Brasilia today. Brazil hasn’t decided
which security it will sell, he said.  
 Brazil’s  benchmark dollar borrowing  costs have fallen this
month the most since February as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  pledged last week to keep the benchmark rate at a
record low for an “extended period” to support the economic
recovery. The average yield on Brazilian dollar bonds fell to a
seven-month low of 5.67 percent yesterday, according to  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ index .  
 Brazil sold $788 million of bonds due in 2021 to yield 5
percent in its last sale abroad on April 15. The bond’s yield
has dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, since the
country sold the securities to 4.85 percent at 1:21 p.m. in New
York.
