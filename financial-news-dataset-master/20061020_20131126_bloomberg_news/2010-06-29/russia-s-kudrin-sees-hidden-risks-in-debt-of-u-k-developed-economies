             Russian Finance Minister Alexei
Kudrin said the debts and deficits of developed countries such
as the U.K. carry “hidden risks” that are dangerous for their
economies.  
 Countries must start reducing their budget deficits
gradually next year, Kudrin said at the Renaissance Capital
investment conference in Moscow today.
