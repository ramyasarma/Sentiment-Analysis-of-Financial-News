             Virgin Group Ltd. founder Richard
Branson said he plans to offer financial services in Canada
after the firm expands in Australia. Branson spoke in an
interview today in Toronto.  
 “The financial service business in Canada is in the hands
of very few companies and we think a little more competition
would be good,” Branson said.
