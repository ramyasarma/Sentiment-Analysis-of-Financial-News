             Maldives’s Cabinet resigned en masse
today after the Indian Ocean island nation’s opposition
threatened to bring a vote of no confidence against its
ministers, Agence France-Presse reported.  
 The 13-member Cabinet is no longer able to work with the
opposition-controlled parliament, the news agency said, citing
an unidentified official.
