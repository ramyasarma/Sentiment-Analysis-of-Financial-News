             Two  Tanzanian  airforce pilots died
when their aircraft crashed on a highway in the east of the
country, causing a vehicle ferrying Dutch tourists to overturn,
the army said.  
 The accident occurred on the Segera-Chalinze highway in the
Tanga region, about 280 kilometers (174 miles) north of the
commercial hub of Dar es Salaam, the Tanzania People’s Defence
Forces said in a faxed statement today. The plane crashed after
it developed technical problems and lost contact with aviation
controllers, it said.  
 “Shortly after it lost communication, the pilots decided to
institute an emergency landing on a tarmac road and knocked a
tourists’ vehicle,” the army said. The vehicle, which was parked
at the side of the road, was “extensively” damaged, it said.  
 Two tourists suffered injuries to their legs in the
accident, the army said, without providing more details.  
 “A detailed report on the cause of the accident will be
issued after completion of an official investigation,” it said.
