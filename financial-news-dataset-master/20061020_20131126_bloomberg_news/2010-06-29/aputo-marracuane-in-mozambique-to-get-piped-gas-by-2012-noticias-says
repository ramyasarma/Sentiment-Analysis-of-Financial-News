             Maputo residential and industrial
areas, as well as the nearby Marracuane district in Mozambique,
will have piped gas from the Pande/Temane gas field by 2012, the
state controlled daily Noticias reported, citing Paulino
Gregorio, projects administrator at Empresa Nacional de
Hidrocarbonetos.  
 Construction of pipelines to connect the houses and 
industries in the two areas will begin in 2011, he told the
Maputo-based newspaper.
