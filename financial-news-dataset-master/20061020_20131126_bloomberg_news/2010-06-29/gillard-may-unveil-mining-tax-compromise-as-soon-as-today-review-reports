             Australia’s government may unveil a
compromise for its proposed mining tax as soon as today after
seeking support for the plan from resources companies, the
Australian Financial Review reported, without saying where it
got the information. The deal may reduce the impact of the tax
on existing mining projects and increase the level at which it
starts to apply, according to the Review. The oil and gas
industry may be levied through the petroleum resources rent tax,
the newspaper said.
