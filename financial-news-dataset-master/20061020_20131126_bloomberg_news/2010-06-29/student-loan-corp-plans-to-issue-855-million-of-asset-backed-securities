             Student Loan Corp. , the lender
majority-owned by Citigroup Inc., plans to sell $855 million of
asset-backed securities, according to a person familiar with the
offering.  
 The loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms aren’t
public. Bank of America Corp. is also selling $1.23 billion of
bonds backed by government-guaranteed student loans.  SLM Corp. ,
known as Sallie Mae, is marketing a $1.7 billion offering tied
to private loans, or those that don’t carry the guarantee, a
person familiar with that offering said.  
 This year, $8 billion of asset-backed securities tied to
student loans have been sold, compared with $10.4 billion during
the same period in 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sallie Mae hasn’t issued debt linked to private
student loans, which is harder to sell because it lacks a
government guarantee, since the Federal Reserve ended its
program to thaw credit markets in March.  
 Sallie Mae sold $1.21 billion in federally backed bonds in
April, and the top-rated portion set to mature in 3.3 years
yielded 40 basis points more than the one-month London interbank
offered rate. The current offering includes a top-rated slice
maturing in about 3.51 years that may yield between 275 basis
points and 285 basis points more than Libor. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  
 Also being marketed this week is a $650 million sale backed
by auto loans from Richmond, Virginia-based CarMax Inc. World
Financial Network Bank is issuing $450 million of bonds backed
by credit-card payments, and a leasing unit of Sydney-based
Macquarie Group Ltd. is selling $500 million of securities
backed by auto leases from Australia.
