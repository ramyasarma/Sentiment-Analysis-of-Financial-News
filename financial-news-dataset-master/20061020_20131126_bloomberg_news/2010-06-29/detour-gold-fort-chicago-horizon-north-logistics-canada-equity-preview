             Canadian stocks  fell the most in a
year, led by banks and commodity producers, after the U.S.
Conference Board lowered its index of Chinese leading economic
indicators and commodity futures dropped.  
 Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest producer of base
metals and coal, declined 5.7 percent after announcing an
explosion at a coal mine in British Columbia. Suncor Energy
Inc., Canada’s biggest oil and gas company, lost 4.1 percent as
crude oil slumped the most since June 4. Royal Bank of Canada,
the country’s biggest bank, decreased 3.1 percent as lenders
retreated around the world.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  decreased 343.17
points, or 3 percent, the most since June 22, 2009, to a four-
month low of 11,263.83.  
 “The market seems to be spooked,” said  Greg Taylor , who
helps oversee C$4.5 billion ($4.28 billion) at Aurion Capital
Management in Toronto. “The one thing that was going to save
global growth was China, and now there’s questions if that is
sustainable.”  
 The S&P/TSX has dropped 5.6 percent since June 21 as the
sales of new and existing U.S. homes failed to meet economists’
estimates, speculation of a European sovereign debt default
increased and energy futures declined on weather forecasts. For
the quarter, the index is down 6.4 percent.  
 The Conference Board said China’s leading economic
indicators increased 0.3 percent in April, less than the 1.7
percent gain it reported on June 15. The organization cited a
calculation mistake on construction statistics for the error in
its original number.  
 Consumer Confidence  
 Stocks extended their decline after the Conference Board’s
monthly index of  U.S. consumer confidence  retreated more than
most economists expected.  
 All but one of 41  S&P/TSX financial stocks  dropped. Royal
Bank declined 3.1 percent to a 10-month low of C$51. Toronto-
Dominion Bank, which has 1,039 branches in the U.S., lost 3
percent to C$68.59. Manulife Financial Corp., which got 54
percent of its revenue from the U.S. last year, decreased 5.4
percent to C$15.38, the lowest price since April 2009.  
 The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of commodities fell
2.8 percent, the most since August 2009. Copper dropped 5.1
percent in New York. China is the biggest user of the base
metal.  
 First Quantum Minerals Ltd., Canada’s second-biggest copper
producer, declined 6.4 percent to C$54.50. Western Coal Corp.,
whose products are used in Asian steel mills,  led the S&P/TSX 
with a 12 percent slump to C$4.16.  
 ‘Extensive’ Damage  
 Teck tumbled 5.7 percent to C$31.77 after saying the
explosion at its Greenhills coal mine caused “extensive”
damage to one of the buildings there. Earlier today, the stock
fell as low as $30.43, which would have been the lowest closing
price in  eight months .  
 Concern that the Chinese economy will slow also weighed on
crude oil, as China is the world’s second-biggest energy
consumer. Oil futures retreated 3 percent to C$75.94 a barrel,
while natural gas slumped 3.8 percent.  
 Suncor lost 4.1 percent to C$31.65. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-biggest energy company by market
value, slipped 3.3 percent to C$35.05. Talisman Energy Inc., an
oil and gas producer with operations in North America, the North
Sea and Indonesia, decreased 4.1 percent, the most in 11 months,
to C$16.23.  
 BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. retreated 4.4
percent to a 15-month low of $52.41. Verizon Communications Inc.
will start selling Apple Inc.’s iPhone next year, breaking AT&T
Inc’s exclusive hold on the device in the U.S., two people
familiar with the plans said.  
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. fell for a fourth day,
slumping 2.6 percent to an eight-month low of C$92.60. Bank of
Nova Scotia analyst  Sam Kanes  reduced his share-price estimate
on the stock to C$138 from C$150.
