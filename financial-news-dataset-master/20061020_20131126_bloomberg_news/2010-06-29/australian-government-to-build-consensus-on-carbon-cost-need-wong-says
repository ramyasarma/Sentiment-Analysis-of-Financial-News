             The Australian government will build
a “lasting and deep community consensus” on the need for a
price on carbon, Climate Change Minister Penny Wong said at a
conference in Brisbane today.  
 “We will build this consensus, despite vocal opponents who
will say anything they can to undermine the science,” Wong
said.
