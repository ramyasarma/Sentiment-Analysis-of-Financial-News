             India’s opposition parties have
called a nationwide strike on July 5 to protest a rise in fuel
prices they say will stoke inflation and hurt poor people.  
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government on June 25
permitted state refiners to raise prices of gasoline by about
3.5 rupees (8 cents) a liter and those of diesel by 2 rupees, as
it sought to cut subsidies and trim the budget deficit from a
16-year high. Gasoline has been freed fully from government
controls, while diesel prices will eventually be market-
determined.  
 The government’s decision shows “colossal economic
mismanagement and callousness,” Nitin Gadkari, the president of
the main opposition  Bharatiya Janata Party , said in a statement
in New Delhi. “Common people are being made to suffer an
unprecedented onslaught of rising prices.”  
 As many as 10 other opposition parties, including the
 Communist Party of India (Marxist)  and the regional Telugu Desam
Party, have called for stoppages on the same day.  
 Opposition parties have been escalating their offensive
against the government over rising food prices and wholesale-
price inflation, which accelerated to 10.16 percent in May from
a year earlier, near the fastest pace in 17 months.  
 In April, they blocked roads in the capital, New Delhi, and
demonstrated near Parliament.
