             Corn fell for a seventh straight
session, its longest losing streak since March, on concern that
economic growth in China will slow, reducing demand for animal
feed and food made from the crop.  
 Chinese stocks  ended the day at the lowest level in 14
months, after the Conference Board revised down its April gauge
for China’s economic outlook to indicate a weaker expansion. The
 S&P GSCI Total Return Index  of 24 commodities fell the most in
three weeks. China is the second biggest consumer of corn, after
the U.S., and the world’s largest producer of hogs.  
 “The Chinese economy appears to be slowing and that could
have a lasting negative impact on grain demand,” said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.
“A global economic-growth problem is developing that will have
a deflationary impact” on commodities, including corn and
soybeans, Gerlach said.  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 6 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $3.4675 a bushel at 10:36 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Earlier, the price dropped to $3.45, the lowest level
since June 9. Over the prior six sessions, the contract
retreated 7.3 percent as rain in the Midwest boosted the yield
potential of the U.S. crop.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
