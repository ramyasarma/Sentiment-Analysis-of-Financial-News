             Gold prices rose for the third time
in four sessions amid slumping U.S. consumer confidence and
signs of slowing economic growth in China, boosting demand for
the precious metal as a store of value.  
 An index of consumer confidence in June fell more than
analysts forecast, and a gauge of China’s economy in April
showed the smallest gain in five months. Global equities
tumbled, and most commodities slumped.  
 “Gold is very finely tuned to investor concerns about the
economy,”  Jeffrey M. Christian , the managing director of CPM
Group, said in an interview in New York. “If the economic
situation deteriorates, prices will rise because investors will
shift money from Treasuries to gold.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August rose $3.80, or 0.3
percent, to $1,242.40 on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
metal fell as much as 0.9 percent.  
 “The risk-aversion crowd is dumping everything that’s
risky and buying gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. Gold may reach
$1,400 by the end of the year, he said.  
 Gold has jumped 13 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,266.50 on June 21, partly on demand for a haven amid Europe’s
sovereign-debt woes. This month, the precious metal reached all-
time highs in euros, U.K. pounds and Swiss francs.  
 “With Chinese growth concerns surfacing and European Union
default fears on the rise, we expect investor dip-buying to
provide further background support,” said  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London.  
 Silver futures for September delivery dropped 8.3 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $18.625 an ounce.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell $15.30, or 1
percent, to $1,555.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery declined $18.05, or
3.8 percent, to $454.40 an ounce, marking the biggest drop since
June 4.
