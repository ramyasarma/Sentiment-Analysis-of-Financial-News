             Mohammed Ali Yasin , chief executive
officer at Shuaa Securities LLC in Abu Dhabi, resigned, two
bankers familiar with the matter said.  
 Yasin will continue in his role at Shuaa Securities, the
brokerage division of  Shuaa Capital PSC , until August, said one
of the bankers, who declined to be identified because the matter
hasn’t been made public.  
 Shuaa “will put out a statement soon,” said  Oliver Schutzmann , the company’s chief communications officer, without
specifying what the statement will be about. Shuaa is the United
Arab Emirates’ biggest investment bank.  
 Reuters reported Yasin’s departure earlier today, without
saying where it got the information.
