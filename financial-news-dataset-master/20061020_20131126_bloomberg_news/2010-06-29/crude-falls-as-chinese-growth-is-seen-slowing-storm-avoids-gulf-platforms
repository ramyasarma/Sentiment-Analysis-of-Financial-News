             Crude oil fell the most in more than
three weeks as China’s economy grew at the slowest pace in five
months in April and confidence among U.S. consumers declined
more than forecast.  
 Oil lost 3 percent after the Conference Board said China’s
economy expanded more slowly than previously estimated. The
group’s U.S. confidence index in June was lower than all
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  dropped to its lowest level since October.  
 “The world economy appears to be crumbling again,” said
 Tom Bentz , a broker at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New
York. “Stocks and oil are down, and the dollar’s up. It’s a
return of the flight to quality.”  
 Oil for August delivery fell $2.31, or 3 percent, to settle
at $75.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the
biggest one-day drop since June 4. Crude is heading for its
first quarterly decline since 2008, losing 9.3 percent since the
end of March. Futures have fallen 4.3 percent this year.  
 Prices declined from the settlement as equities dropped.
The American Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S.
crude-oil stockpiles decreased 3.4 million barrels to 359
million. August oil fell $2.57, or 3.3 percent, to $75.68 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  
 Brent crude for August delivery fell $2.15, or 2.8 percent,
to $75.44 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  
 The measure of China’s economy compiled by the New York-
based Conference Board rose 0.3 percent in April, less than the
1.7 percent gain it reported June 15. The research group
corrected the outlook, saying in an e-mailed statement that the
previous reading contained a “calculation error” for total
floor space on which construction began.  
 Consumer Confidence  
 The Conference Board reported its U.S.  confidence  index
slumped to 52.9 in June from a revised 62.7 in May, as Americans
became pessimistic about the outlook for the labor market and
the economy. The median forecast of 71 economists’ estimates in
the Bloomberg survey called for a decline to 62.5.  
 The U.S. and China are the largest consumers of energy.
Economic growth spurs the countries’ appetite for oil and other
fuels.  
 The S&P 500 fell 3.1 percent to 1,041.25. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  lost 2.7 percent to 9,870.30. It was the
first time the Dow closed below 10,000 since June 9.  
 The dollar gained 0.6 percent against the euro, curbing the
appeal of commodities as an alternative investment. The European
currency traded at $1.2207 from $1.2277 yesterday.  
 President  Barack Obama  said after meeting with Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  today that the U.S. economy is
strengthening and recovering from the worst recession since the
1930s. Still, job losses remain a “great concern” and the
economy faces “headwinds” because of nervousness in the U.S.
about Europe’s debt crisis.  
 Third-Quarter Forecast  
 Oil will average $65 a barrel in New York in the third
quarter, pulled down by Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis,
according to a forecast today by  Adam Sieminski , chief energy
economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Washington. Nymex crude has
averaged $78.48 so far this year. It averaged $68.24 in the
third quarter of 2009.  
 Prices have peaked for the near-term and may drop toward
$62 a barrel in New York after stalling at a $78.39 resistance
level indicated by the Fibonacci sequence, according to
technical analysis by Commerzbank AG analysts  Karen Jones  and
 Axel Rudolph  in London.  
 Oil also fell on predictions that Tropical Storm Alex,
moving northwest across the southern Gulf of Mexico, will miss
oil-producing areas. It’s forecast to make landfall in Mexico,
just south of the U.S. border, late tomorrow as a hurricane,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.  
 Non-Event  
 “It appears the storm is a non-event in terms of damage to
the Gulf of Mexico,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market
research at Tradition Energy, a Stamford, Connecticut-based
procurement adviser. “A temporary decrease in output either
through imports or offshore production really isn’t that
critical to the market right now.”  
 U.S. oil supplies were at the highest level in 20 years for
the middle of June in the week ended June 18, according to an
Energy Department report last week.  
 Inventories  probably fell  1 million barrels in the week
ended June 25 from 365.1 million the prior week, according to
the median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
before a government report tomorrow. It would be the first
decline in three weeks.  
 Gasoline demand in the week ended June 25 was 2 percent
below the year-earlier level, according to MasterCard Inc.’s
SpendingPulse report, which tracks retail gasoline purchases.  
 Gasoline for July delivery dropped 6.56 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $2.072 a gallon on the Nymex.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 462,255
contracts as of 3:16 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 375,055
contracts yesterday, 52 percent below the average of the past
three months and the lowest level this year. Open interest was
1.26 million contracts.
