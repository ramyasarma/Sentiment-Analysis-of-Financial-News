             Gold may decline for a second day in
New York as some investors sell the metal to lock in gains from
its rally to near a record. Other precious metals fell.  
 Bullion futures dropped 1.4 percent yesterday after earlier
trading within 0.3 percent of an all-time high. European
equities declined to the lowest level in more than two weeks
today amid concerns that China’s economy is growing at a slower
pace than previously estimated.  
 Gold is “likely to remain vulnerable to further pockets of
long liquidation or profit taking in the run-up to month- and
quarter-end,” said  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London. “With Chinese growth concerns
surfacing and European Union default fears on the rise, we
expect investor dip-buying to provide further background
support.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August lost $3.30, or 0.3
percent, to $1,235.30 an ounce at 8:17 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices are up 11 percent this quarter. Gold for immediate
delivery in London was 0.4 percent lower at $1,234.55.  
 Bullion fell to $1,236 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,261 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Gold is up 1.7 percent
this month in New York.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped as much as 2.2 percent
after the Conference Board corrected its April gauge for the
outlook of China’s economy to indicate slower growth and
Citigroup Inc. said the country’s exports face “strong
headwinds.” European confidence in the economic outlook
unexpectedly improved in June, a report from the European
Commission in Brussels showed today.  
 ‘Ultimate Insurance Policy’  
 Bullion is on course for its biggest quarterly advance
since the final three months of 2007, as investors sought to
protect their wealth from prolonged financial turbulence in
Europe and on concern the global recovery may slow. The metal
gained 13 percent this year, reaching a record $1,266.50 an
ounce on June 21.  
 Japan’s unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 5.2 percent
in May and households cut spending, adding to evidence that
consumer outlays are too weak to drive the economic recovery. A
separate report showed industrial production fell in May as
manufacturers accumulated inventories.  
 “Gold is the ultimate insurance policy in the face of
financial market uncertainty and investors continue to receive
mixed messages with respect to the broader world economy,” said
 Gavin Wendt , senior analyst with MineLife Pty Ltd. in Sydney.
“Continued strong growth amongst emerging economies is being
offset by uncertainty in Europe and the U.S.”  
 Holdings Record  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, were unchanged for a second day at a
record 1,316.18 metric tons yesterday, according to the
company’s website. Global holdings of the metal by ETFs rose 4
tons to an all-time high 2,062.6 tons yesterday, according to
 Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 Silver for September delivery in New York lost 0.4 percent
to $18.635 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery fell 1.2
percent to $1,552.20 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery
declined 1.9 percent to $463.50 an ounce.
