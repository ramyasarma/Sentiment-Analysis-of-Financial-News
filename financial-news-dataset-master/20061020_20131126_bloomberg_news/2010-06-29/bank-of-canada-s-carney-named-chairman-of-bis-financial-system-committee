             The Bank for International
Settlements appointed Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  as
Chairman of the Committee on the Global Financial System.  
 Carney’s three-year term begins July 1, and he replaces
U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Donald Kohn , the Basel,
Switzerland-based BIS said in a statement today. The committee
monitors risks in global financial markets for central bank
leaders and manages the collection of BIS statistics.  
 “I look forward to maintaining the excellent reputation
that this committee has built under Don Kohn’s leadership,”
Carney said in a statement read out by spokesman  Jeremy Harrison . “Its work will contribute importantly to identifying
systemic trends and vulnerabilities and to advancing global
financial system reforms.”  
 Carney, 45, has led Canada’s central bank since February
2008 and is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment banker.
