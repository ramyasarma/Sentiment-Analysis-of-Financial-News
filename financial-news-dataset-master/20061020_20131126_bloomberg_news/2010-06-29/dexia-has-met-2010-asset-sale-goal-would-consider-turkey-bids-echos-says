             Dexia SA has met its asset-sale goal
for 2010, having concluded sales worth around 17 billion euros,
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Mariani told French daily Les
Echos in an interview.  
 The bank is ready to listen to bids for its Turkish
insurance unit, and could also wait until 2012 before selling
the business, Mariani was cited as saying. Dexia plans to end
its presence in Japan by the end of 2011, he told Les Echos.
