             Uganda  will use surplus funds
generated by oil production to invest in domestic and foreign
financial assets, Finance Minister  Syda Bbumba  said.  
 The East African nation will create a fund where oil
receipts will be deposited and any money that isn’t needed to
fund the budget will be invested in the markets, Bbumba said in
an interview today in the capital, Kampala.  
 “Excess oil revenue will be invested in financial
products,” she said. “We shall look at both the local and
international markets depending on the situation.”  
 Uganda, with a population of more than 30 million people
and an economy of $16.4 billion, will begin commercial
production of oil next year when  Tullow Oil Plc  starts output at
its Kasamene field.  
 The country has an estimated 2 billion barrels of oil, with
800 million barrels already discovered, according to Tullow.
Only four other sub-Saharan African countries -- Nigeria,
Angola, Gabon and Sudan -- have proven reserves of more than 2
billion barrels, according to the  BP Statistical Review of World
Energy .  
 Oil revenue will primarily be spent on transport
infrastructure, energy, agriculture, science, health and
education, Bbumba said.  
 Earlier this month, Bbumba announced a 7.55-trillion-
shilling ($3.31 billion) budget for the fiscal year through June
2011. At least 75 percent of that amount will be raised through
domestic taxes and the remainder from foreign loans and grants.
