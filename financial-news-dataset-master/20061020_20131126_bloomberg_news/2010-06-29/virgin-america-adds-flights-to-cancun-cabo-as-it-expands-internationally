             Virgin America Inc., the low-fare
U.S. airline part-owned by U.K. billionaire  Richard Branson ,
plans to begin service to Mexico before year’s end.  
 The carrier will fly from San Francisco to San Jose del
Cabo, Mexico, and to Cancun, as well as from Los Angeles to
Cancun, pending regulatory approval, according to a company
statement today. Virgin America had planned to add the routes in
2008 and held off when the recession curbed travel.  
 Virgin America is also seeking to add service to two or
three cities by the end of 2011. Places under consideration
include Chicago, Dallas and Austin, Texas, Chief Executive
Officer  David Cush  said this year.  
 The Burlingame, California-based company, which began
service in August 2007, plans to buy 18 Airbus SAS A320 planes
over the next year and a half as it adds flights and routes.
