             China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group
Co.  will start trial operations of a nuclear reactor at the
Lingao plant that will supply electricity to the country’s
southern region and cut coal use.  
 Commercial operations of the reactor, part of a phase-two
expansion of Lingao, are expected to start in October and a
second unit will commence in 2011, the government-controlled
nuclear power supplier said in a statement posted on the website
of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration
Commission today.  
 China may spend more than 1 trillion yuan ($147 billion) in
the next decade on nuclear energy to reduce reliance on more
polluting coal and oil, Xu Yuming, the vice secretary of China
Nuclear Energy Association, said on May 19. China, which relies
on coal to produce about 80 percent of its power needs, is the
world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.  
 The reactors will generate about 15 billion kilowatt-hours
of electricity and reduce coal use by 6 million metric tons a
year, Guangdong Nuclear, the nation’s second-biggest reactor
operator, said in the statement. China’s coal production rose
8.8 percent to 3 billion tons in 2009. China is the third-
largest nuclear power user in Asia, according to the BP
Statistical Review.
