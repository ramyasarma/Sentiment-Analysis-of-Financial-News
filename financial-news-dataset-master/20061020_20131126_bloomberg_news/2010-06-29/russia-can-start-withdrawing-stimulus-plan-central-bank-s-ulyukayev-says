             Russia’s central bank and government
can start withdrawing emergency stimulus measures from the
economy because the banking system has enough liquidity and
reserves, said Alexei Ulyukayev, first deputy chairman of the
central bank.  
 Banks have 2 trillion rubles ($64 billion) of liquid
assets, half of which is in central bank bonds, Ulyukayev said
at a Renaissance Capital conference in Moscow today. Bank Rossii
may end its unsecured lending program this year, he said.
