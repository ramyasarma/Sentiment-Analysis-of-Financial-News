             India, the largest sugar user, may
produce as much as 23 million metric tons in the year starting
October 1, up from an estimated 18.8 million tons this season, a
government official told reporters in New Delhi today.  
 Output in Maharashtra, the nation’s biggest producer, may
rise to 8.6 million tons from 7.09 million tons a year earlier,
the official said. Production in Uttar Pradesh, the second-
largest, may total 6 million tons, he said.  
 The estimate was announced after officials from the cane-
growing states met food ministry officials in New Delhi today.  
 India, the biggest sugar importer, may stay away from the
global market in the 2010-2011 season as production may reach 24
million tons, matching demand,  Vivek Saraogi , managing director
at  Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd. , the nation’s second-biggest mill,
said in an interview May 27.  
 Stockpiles will jump 53 percent in the year ending Sept. 30,
according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association. The nation will
end the season with 4.9 million tons compared with 3.2 million
tons a year earlier, the association  said  on June 14.  
 Farmers planted cane in 4.73 million hectares as of June 25,
compared with 4.52 million hectares, the farm ministry said.
