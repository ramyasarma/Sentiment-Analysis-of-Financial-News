             Aviva Plc , the U.K.’s second-largest
insurer, is marketing a fund that pays 22.5 percent if the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks stays above a preset
level for three years.  
 The five-year Aviva Investors Structured Returns Fund 1
will be automatically redeemed, or called, on July 2, 2013, if
the  FTSE 100  remains above the level to be set this week,
according to the prospectus for the fund. If it isn’t redeemed
early, investors will earn a return equal to the percentage gain
in the stock index at maturity.  
 Otherwise, investors will get back all the money they paid
for the notes as long as the index doesn’t fall more than 50
percent for five years. Below that point, holders incur losses
equal to the percentage decline of the index.  
 In the past 26 years, the fund would have been called with
investors receiving the full payout 80.2 percent of the time,
according to data compiled by Aviva. If the fund wasn’t called,
investors would have received a positive return 6.9 percent of
the time. The fund charges a 6.84 percent fee, which includes
management and broking costs.  
 Structured products issued as funds are perceived by
investors as less risky because they are backed by investment in
relatively safe assets such as government bonds. They are also
more liquid, making it easier for investors to sell before
maturity. The cost of creating and collateralizing funds can
lead to higher fees than for other structured products.  
 Aviva, based in London, will set the FTSE 100 target level
for the fund on July 1, according to the prospectus. The index
was at 4,964 at 9:27 a.m. in London, after tumbling 30 percent
since the start of the credit crisis in August 2007.
