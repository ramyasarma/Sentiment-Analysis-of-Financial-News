             Carlyle Group, the world’s second-
largest private-equity firm, has sold about 750 million euros
($915 million) of leveraged loans in an auction, according to
two people with knowledge of the sale.  
 The firm was seeking bidders for a total of 1.5 billion
euros of debt to actively-traded borrowers such as Irish phone
company Eircom Group Ltd. and U.K. pay-television company Virgin
Media Inc., one of the people said. The people declined to be
identified because the information is private.  
 Rosanna Konarzewski, a Carlyle spokeswoman in London,
declined to comment.  
 “Loan prices are likely to remain suppressed until the
portfolio clears,” Babson Capital Management LLC analysts wrote
in a note to clients yesterday, without disclosing the seller.
Loan bids ended the week down about 25 basis points June 25.  
 Leveraged loans are rated below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s
and Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Private-equity firms pay
for takeovers by loading a target company with debt and using
its cash flow to repay lenders, causing the company’s ratings to
fall below investment grade.
