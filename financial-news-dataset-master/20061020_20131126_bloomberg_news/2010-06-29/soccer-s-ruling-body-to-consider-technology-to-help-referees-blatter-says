             FIFA, soccer’s ruling body, should
look at the use of technology again at a meeting in July, Sepp
Blatter, the organization’s president, told reporters in
Johannesburg today.  
 “Its obvious that after the experience so far we have made
in this World Cup it would be a nonsense to not reopen the file
on technology at the meeting in July,” he said.
