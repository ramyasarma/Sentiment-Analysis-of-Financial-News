             Massimo Tartaglia , the man who
assaulted Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  at a Dec. 13
rally, was acquitted by a Milan judge because he is “mentally
unfit,” Ansa newswire reported.  
 Tartaglia must remain under psychiatric care, Ansa said.
On Dec. 13, Tartaglia threw a statuette of Milan’s cathedral at
Berlusconi from close range as the premier shook hands with
supporters in downtown Milan. Berlusconi suffered a fractured
nose and broken teeth.
