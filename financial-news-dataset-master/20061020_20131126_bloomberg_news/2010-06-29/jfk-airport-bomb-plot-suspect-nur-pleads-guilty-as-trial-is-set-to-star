             A Guyanese man, on the eve of his
trial, pleaded guilty to his role in a plot to blow up New
York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.  
 The trial of two co-defendants is set to begin tomorrow,
U.S. District Judge Dora Irizzary in Brooklyn, New York, said
today when Abdel Nur, 60, pleaded guilty to one count of
providing support to terrorists.  
 The men hatched the plot in January 2006 and circulated
their plan to an international network of Muslim extremists,
prosecutors said.
