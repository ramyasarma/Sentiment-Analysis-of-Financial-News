             European core-market bonds risk
falling as concern eases about Greek securities dropping out of
indexes and as low yields deter investors, according to Nomura
International Plc.  
 “We are a little cautious about near-term prospects for
the core markets with the flight-to-quality elements having
ample scope for reversal,” strategists led by  Nick Firoozye  in
London wrote in a report dated yesterday. “This is not to say
we have become more broadly negative on bonds. It is more a case
of being wary against overly bullish sentiment at such low yield
levels with some key event risks set to pass.”
