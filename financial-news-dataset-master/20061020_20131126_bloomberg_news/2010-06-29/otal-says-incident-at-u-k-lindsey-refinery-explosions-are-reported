             Total SA  said pipeline deliveries of
crude oil to the  Lindsey  refinery in northeast England were
halted after a fire and explosion at the plant.  
 Road shipments of oil products from the refinery also
stopped, Total spokeswoman Emma Hirons said by phone. Rail
shipments restarted, she said.  
 Lindsey is the U.K.’s fourth-largest refinery with a
capacity to process 221,000 barrels of crude oil a day. Total
has said it plans to sell Lindsey as it seeks to reduce its oil-
refining capacity.  
 The fire occurred in a crude distillation unit, which helps
process oil into products such as gasoline and  jet fuel , Total
said. Adjacent units have been safely isolated, Total said.  
 Hirons couldn’t immediately say if maintenance was taking
place at the plant at the time of the fire. Total had planned to
shut part of Lindsey this month for work, three people familiar
with the situation said in May.  
 The incident just before midday local time caused minor
injuries to two workers at the site, one of whom has been taken
to hospital, Total said.
