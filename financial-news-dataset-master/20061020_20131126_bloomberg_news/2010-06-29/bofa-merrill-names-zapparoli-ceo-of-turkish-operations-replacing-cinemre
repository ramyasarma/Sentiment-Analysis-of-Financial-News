             Elif Bilgi Zapparoli  was appointed
chief executive officer of the Turkish operations of Bank of
America Corp. Merrill Lynch, replacing  Kubilay Cinemre .  
 Zapparoli will report to  Andrea Orcel , executive chairman
of global banking and markets, the company said in an e-mailed
statement from Istanbul.  
 Previously chairwoman of EFG Istanbul Securities, Zapparoli
served on the board of Eurobank Tekfen AS since 2007, Merrill
said. She also worked in New York at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Morgan Stanley, and earned an MBA from Harvard Business
School.  
 Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Bank of America  is seeking
to expand its investment-banking and wealth-management
businesses outside the U.S. after acquiring Merrill in January
2009. Merrill had three times as many corporate relationships as
Bank of America in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia,
global corporate banking head  Paul Donofrio  said in an interview
in March.  
 Cinemre left last month after four years at the company.
