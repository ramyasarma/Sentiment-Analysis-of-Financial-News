             Vodacom Group Ltd., the largest 
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans, had lost 
at least 600 million rand ($79 million) since the country’s 
telecommunications regulator in March introduced a reduction in
the fee that operators charge each other to carry calls on 
their networks, Business Day reported.   
 The company asked the Independent Communications Authority 
of South Africa to delay a second round of cuts in 
interconnection fees, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited 
Vodacom SA Managing Director Shameel Joosub as saying. Having 
two reductions in the charge in one financial year would be 
“steep and unprecedented,” Business Day cited Joosub as 
saying at hearings held by Icasa yesterday.
