             Japan Airlines Corp. may ask
creditor banks to waive more than 400 billion yen in debt,
compared with the initial 358.5 billion yen request, Kyodo News
said, citing unidentified sources.   
 The carrier’s negative net worth is projected to increase
to nearly 1 trillion yen, the report said.  
 The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of Japan, the
state-backed turnaround fund, is likely to increase its capital
contribution to the airline from the initial plan of 300 billion
yen, the report said.
