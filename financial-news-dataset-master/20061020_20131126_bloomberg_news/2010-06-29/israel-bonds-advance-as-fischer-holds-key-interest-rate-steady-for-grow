             Israeli government bonds gained
after the central bank held its  benchmark interest rate 
unchanged for a third month to spur economic growth, helping
shore up demand for local assets.  
 Governor  Stanley Fischer  left the rate at 1.5 percent
yesterday, citing “increased uncertainties” in the global
economy, including Europe’s debt crisis. Israel’s  economy
expanded  at an annualized 3.6 percent in the first quarter after
growing 4.5 percent in the previous three months.  
 “It’s natural that bonds all along the curve are
responding positively with shorter-term notes getting a big
boost,” said Gal Bar, a bond trader at Clal Finance Batucha
Investment Management Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “This is coupled with
the continued drop in yields in the U.S. As long as bonds there
continue to rise, we get the backwind here.”  
 The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit maturing in February 2019
increased 0.55 shekel to 113.21 at the close in Tel Aviv,
pushing the yield on the 6 percent notes down seven basis points
to 4.42 percent, the lowest level since April 2009.  
 The yield on the 4 percent note due March 2012 dropped 13
basis points to 2.5 percent, the lowest level since Nov. 16.
Two-year notes are among the most sensitive to local rates
because of their short maturity.  
 U.S. Treasuries  
 U.S. Treasuries advanced, pushing two-year  yields  to a
record low and 10-year yields below 3 percent for the first time
since April 2009, as a decline in stocks boosted demand for the
safest assets.  
 Ten of 18 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg expected the
rate decision, while eight forecast a quarter-point increase.
The Bank of Israel is in the process of gradually bringing
interest rates back to a more “normal” level that reflects the
recovery in economic activity, according to minutes of the May
policy meeting released on June 7.  
 The shekel was little changed at 3.8835 against the dollar
at 5:10 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Stocks declined, with the  TA-25
benchmark index  sliding 2.1 percent to the lowest since
November.
