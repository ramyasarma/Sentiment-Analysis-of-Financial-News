             U.S. beef exports may jump 20
percent to $3.7 billion this year, as demand for the meat
increases in Asia, said Erin Daley, an economist with the
Denver-based U.S. Meat Export Federation.  
 The volume of U.S.  beef exports  may increase by 12 percent
to 1 million metric tons (2.2 billion pounds), Daley said today
on a conference call with reporters. Shipments were valued at
$3.08 billion last year.  
 Beef demand in Asia is increasing as countries recover from
recession and ease trade restrictions imposed following the 2003
discovery of mad cow disease in the U.S., Daley said.  South
Korea , which resumed imports of some U.S. beef in June 2008, has
boosted purchases by 86 percent this year from 2009, she said.
Overall U.S. beef exports this year may still trail 2003 volume
by 3 percent, she said.  
 “This year exports have been tremendous,” Daley said.
“Recovery in U.S. exports has continued to go back toward 2003
volumes.”  
 The U.S. has lost about $14 billion since 2004, when
countries including Korea and Japan curtailed U.S. beef imports
after mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
broke out in the U.S., according to the Meat Export Federation.
Scientists say humans who eat certain parts of infected animals
may contract variant Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease, a similar brain-
wasting ailment.  
 U.S. shipments of beef-muscle-cuts may increase 17 percent
this year, while beef-variety-meat exports will be steady, Daley
said. In the first four months of 2010, the U.S. exported 11
percent of its beef production.  
 Demand for U.S. beef also may increase as competitors
including Argentina and Canada cut production, she said. Of the
world’s top 10 beef producers, only Brazil, India and Mexico are
expanding output this year.
