             Treasury 10-year note yields will
drift higher from the lowest level in more than a year as
China’s decision to let the yuan appreciate fans U.S. inflation
and spurs economic growth, according to Citigroup Inc.  
 A 10 percent depreciation in the dollar against the yuan
may lead to an increase in inflation that will boost the 10-year
note yield by 14 basis points,  Robert Crossley , a strategist in
London at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients today. It may
also lead to a contraction in the U.S. current-account deficit
that would add 15 basis points.  
 “The refloat of the yuan should put upward pressure on
U.S. yields at the margin,” Crossley wrote.  
 The 10-year  yield  dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.97 percent at 12:32 p.m. in London, after
falling below 3 percent for the first time since April 2009.  
 The People’s Bank of China signaled on June 19 that it
would end a two-year peg to the dollar, contributing to the
currency’s biggest five-day rally in 18 months before last
weekend’s Group of 20 meeting.  
 After scrapping a peg to the dollar in July 2005, the
government allowed the yuan to gain 21 percent before holding it
at about 6.83 to the dollar since July 2008.
