             Japanese exporters are likely to
sell euros for yen, pushing the 16-nation common currency down
further, Nikkei English News reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  
 Since the euro’s slide in May, Japanese companies have
avoided selling the euro-denominated income they received from
exports to Europe, the Nikkei reported. As their holdings of
euros have continued to increase even as the single currency
shows few signs of a rebound, the companies may begin to sell
the euro at a loss, the Nikkei said.  
 Exporters had assumed a euro-yen exchange rate of between
120 and 125, so their earnings would be lower than expected if
they sell euros at this time, the Nikkei reported.
