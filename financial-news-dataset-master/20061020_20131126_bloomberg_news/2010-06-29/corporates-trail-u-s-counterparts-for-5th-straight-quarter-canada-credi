             Canadian corporate bonds are
underperforming their U.S. counterparts for a fifth straight
quarter for the first time since 2007, as issuance rises in
expectation of higher central bank rates.  
 Canada’s corporate debt has returned 1.67 percent in the
second quarter, including reinvested interest, less than the
2.85 percent gains U.S. corporate date made investors over the
same time, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.  
 “We haven’t rallied as much as U.S. corporates have in the
last little while,” said  Julian Pope , director of credit
trading in the fixed-income group at Desjardins Securities Corp.
in Toronto, in a telephone interview. “There are also concerns
about supply from all sectors” in Canada.  
 Companies may have hurried to issue debt ahead of the Bank
of Canada’s June 1 decision to raise its benchmark overnight
rate to 0.5 percent from a record-low 0.25 percent. Canadian
companies issued C$37.8 billion ($36.5 billion) in debt so far
this year, up 34 percent from C$28.2 billion in the first half
of 2009, according to Bloomberg data. In the U.S., companies
sold $519 billion of debt in the first half of 2010, a drop of
30 percent from $744 billion during the same period last year.  
 The spread over risk-free government debt has narrowed
faster in the U.S. than in Canada over the past 18 months,
falling by 395 basis points, according to the Merrill data,
while narrowing in Canada by 252 basis points since reaching a
record 401 points at the start of 2009.  
 Corporates Versus Provincials  
 Corporate bonds are trailing provincial and municipal debt
in the second quarter, which has returned 2.55 percent, and are
on pace to surpass the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX  Composite Index,
which has fallen 3.6 percent since April 1.  
 Elsewhere in credit markets, yield on the 10-year benchmark
government  bond  fell to 3.16 yesterday, the lowest in more than
a year. The 3.5 percent security due in June 2020 rose 28 cents
to C$102.84.  
 Economists predict the benchmark 10-year will yield 3.52
percent by the end of September, down 29 basis points from the
3.83 percent forecast last month, according to the median of 9
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The Bank of Canada will announce details tomorrow of the
July 7 auction of two-year bonds. The previous 2-year auction,
on June 2, drew an average yield of 1.928 percent, the central
bank said on its  Web site .  
 Overall yields on provincial bonds fell to 3.305 percent
yesterday, from 3.336 percent on June 25, the Merrill data said.
Spreads held at 63 basis points from the end of last week.  
 ‘Safe Haven’ of U.S.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own corporate instead
of federal debt was 149 basis points in Canada yesterday, versus
208 basis points in the U.S. The average yield on Canadian
corporate bonds was 4.01 percent yesterday, compared with 4.35
percent for similar U.S. bonds, according to Merrill.  
 Malcolm J. Jones , a portfolio manager who oversees about
C$350 million at Adroit Investment Management Ltd. in Edmonton,
Alberta, cited concern over the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe
as a driver for the outperformance by U.S. corporates.  
 “People are scared and they’re running for the safe haven
of the U.S.,” Jones said by telephone. “It’s money coming out
of Europe and going back to the U.S. Canadian bonds don’t get
the same flow.”  
 Canada’s company debt last outperformed the U.S. in the
three months through March 2009. Canadian corporates have
outperformed U.S. corporates in eight of the 17 years since
1993, with the last instance in 2008, the Merrill data show.  
 Corporate Issuance  
 The debt of Canadian industrial companies returned 2.08
percent so far during the second quarter, compared with 1.27
percent for financial institutions, the Merrill data also
showed.  
 The Investment Industry Association of Canada  reported last
month that 2009 corporate new issuance was C$64.5 billion,
including conventional bonds and medium-term notes. It was
C$61.3 billion the year before.  
 Adroit’s Jones doesn’t see the U.S. outperformance of
Canada continuing much beyond one more quarter.  
 “Those who are getting out of Europe have already done
so,” he said.
