             KBC Groep NV, Belgium’s biggest bank
by market value, denied a report that it may drop a planned
initial public offering for its Czech subsidiary Ceskoslovenska
Obchodni Banka AS.  
 “The IPO is part of a strategic plan as agreed upon with
the European Union,” Stef Leunens, a spokesman for the company,
said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg News today.  
 KBC may drop the IPO because the bank is one of its most
profitable units, Hospodarske Noviny reported today, citing two
unidentified KBC executives.  
 Brussels-based KBC said June 4 it’s watching markets
closely before selling a minority stake in CSOB.
