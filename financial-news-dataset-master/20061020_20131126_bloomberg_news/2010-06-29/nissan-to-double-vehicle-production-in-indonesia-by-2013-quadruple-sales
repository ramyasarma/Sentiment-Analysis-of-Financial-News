             Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third
largest automaker, plans to invest $20 million at a plant in
Indonesia to double production in the country as economic growth
spurs demand for cars.  
 The investment will allow Nissan to double capacity in
Indonesia to 100,000 vehicles a year by 2013, the company said
in a statement today. Sales that year may more than quadruple to
90,000 vehicles from 21,440 in 2009, it said.  
 “We are going to invest a lot in Indonesia,” Nissan’s
Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said at a press conference
in Jakarta today. “I am personally very optimistic about the
prospects of the economy and the car industry in Indonesia.”  
 Nissan is also considering Indonesia as an export base,
Ghosn said. The company will establish a research and
development center in the country next year for market research,
vehicle assessment and quality control, the statement said.  
 Widening labor unrest has forced auto parts makers to raise
wages in China, increasing production costs for Nissan,  Toyota
Motor Corp.  and  Honda Motor Co.  A shrinking supply of low-cost
labor in the world’s largest auto market is increasing workers’
bargaining power.  
 Nissan  fell  1.9 percent to close at 629 yen today in Tokyo
trading, compared with a 1.3 percent drop in the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The stock declined for a sixth
straight day, the longest streak since November.
