             Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
largest carmaker, led a seventh straight monthly increase in
vehicle production in Japan as a global recovery spurred exports.  
 Output at the country’s 12 vehicle makers in May rose 31
percent from a year earlier to 708,453 vehicles, the  Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association  said in a statement today.
Exports surged 47 percent to 340,721.  
 Japanese carmakers scaled back output a year ago,
temporarily halting production lines to reduce inventory amid a
recession. The companies are boosting production this year as
demand recovers in the U.S. and Japan and continues rising in
China, the world’s largest auto market.  
 Toyota’s domestic production in May rose 22 percent from a
year earlier to 235,412 vehicles as sales jumped 39 percent and
exports increased 15 percent, the company said last week.  Honda
Motor Co. , the nation’s second-largest carmaker, said domestic
output surged 42 percent to 74,588 as sales gained 18 percent
and exports rose 29 percent.  
 Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-biggest carmaker, raised
domestic output 24 percent to 79,430 vehicles as exports grew 95
percent.
