             Palm oil declined, extending a
second straight quarterly drop, as crude oil and soybeans
declined, reducing demand for the tropical commodity used in
food and biofuels.  
 The September-delivery contract fell as much as 0.8 percent
to 2,380 ringgit ($737) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange at the 12:30 p.m. trading break. Palm oil has fallen
6.9 percent this quarter on forecasts for record output of world
oilseed crops.  
 “The mid-term technical outlook is still pointing down,”
said Ryan Long, a futures trader at OSK Investment Bank Sdn.
Palm may trade below 2,430 ringgit a ton regardless of concerns
that dry weather may affect the record U.S. soybean crop.  
 The “grossly bearish” technical charts for palm oil
signal prices falling to between 1,990 and 2,200 ringgit a ton,
a RHB Research Institute Sdn. report yesterday said.  
 Crude oil in New York dropped 0.9 percent to $77.57 a
barrel at 12:37 p.m. Singapore time on concerns slower economic
growth may curb energy demand and skepticism that production
from Gulf of Mexico wells will be disrupted by a tropical storm.  
 November-delivery soybeans in Chicago were little changed
at $9.175 a bushel at 12:34 p.m. Singapore time.  
 Soybean prices may come under more pressure “with no corn
rally in sight,”  Scott Briggs , an agricultural commodities
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said
today. Corn for December delivery in Chicago declined 0.3
percent to $3.5175 a bushel, falling for the seventh straight
day, the longest slump since March. Vegetable oils oil often
track crude oil movements as it can be used in biofuels.  
 CME Group Inc.’s September-delivery palm oil contract,
which is pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, gained 0.7
percent to $741.75 a ton.  
 On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil
dropped 1.1 percent to 6,404 yuan ($942) at the 11:30 a.m. break.
