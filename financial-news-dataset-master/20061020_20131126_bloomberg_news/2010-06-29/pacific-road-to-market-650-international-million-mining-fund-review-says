             Pacific Road Capital Management, an
Australian private equity manager, will start marketing a second
international mining fund of up to $650 million, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing investment director Louis
Rozman. The fund will focus on investments in non-conventional
energy sources, the newspaper cited Rozman as saying. The
company’s initial $320 million fund, raised in 2006, has made 10
investments including zinc and gold projects in Mexico and a
bauxite project in Guyana, and expects to make one or two more
before all capital is committed, according to the Review.
