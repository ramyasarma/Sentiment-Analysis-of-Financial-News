             India’s government  bonds  rose for a
second day after the government reduced the size of debt
auctions scheduled for this week by 30 billion rupees ($645
million), which may help ease a cash shortage.  
 Yields fell after Pronab Sen, the government’s top
statistician, said today the central bank may not raise interest
rates immediately because of a cash crunch in the economy. The
 finance ministry  said yesterday it will sell 100 billion rupees
of notes maturing in seven, 12 and 30 years on July 2.  
 “The cut in the size of bond sales is a signal that policy
makers are ready to tackle any problem on the liquidity front,”
said  Srinivasa Raghavan , head of fixed-income at IDBI Gilts in
Mumbai.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 dropped two
basis points to 7.57 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate earlier
fell as much as six basis points to touch its lowest level since
June 10. The price rose 0.15, or 15 paise per 100 rupee face
amount, to 101.56.  
 The government had indicated it may borrow 130 billion
rupees between June 28 and July 2 in its debt-sale calendar
published on March 29.  
 The central bank’s next policy meeting is scheduled for
July 27. The monetary authority last raised interest rates at
its April 20 policy meeting, the second increase this year. Its
benchmark reverse repurchase rate is 3.75 percent and the
 repurchase rate  is 5.25 percent.  
 The benchmark  wholesale-price  index advanced 10.16 percent
from a year earlier in May, approaching the fastest pace in 17
months, after a 9.59 percent gain the previous month.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, was 5.53 percent, compared with 5.57 percent yesterday.
