                  June 29 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) --  Comtec Solar
System Group Ltd. , a Chinese solar ingot and wafer manufacturer,
said a plan to more than double production capacity by June has
been delayed.  
 The capacity expansion to 504 megawatts from 200 megawatts
won’t be completed by the end of June, Comtec Solar said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. More time is
needed to build production facilities and provide power supply
at the plant in Haian Economic Development Zone in Jiangsu
province, it said.  
 The company expects to raise its final output capacity to
600 megawatts as planned by the end of September, Comtec Solar
said in the statement.
