             The Qatar Investment Authority is 
negotiating taking a stake in National Bank of Greece, the 
Financial Times reported on its Web site, citing people 
familiar with the talks.   
 Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund would buy as much as a 7 
percent stake in the Greek bank for about 250 million euros 
($304 million), the Times said. That might help restore 
confidence in Greek banks eroded by the nation’s sovereign debt
crisis, the newspaper said.
