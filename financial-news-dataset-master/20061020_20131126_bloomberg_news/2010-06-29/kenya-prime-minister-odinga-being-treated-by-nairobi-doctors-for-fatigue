             Kenya’s Prime Minister  Raila Odinga 
is unwell and his doctors have recommended he remain in the
hospital for a few days to recover from “fatigue,” his office
said.  
 Odinga is in a “fit and stable” condition, according to a
statement e-mailed from his office in Nairobi today.  
 Doctors have “assured us that the prime minister is in
good enough condition to come to the office and work as usual if
he feels. But they are not allowing that,”  his office said.  
 Odinga checked himself into the Nairobi Hospital late
yesterday after a media event, complaining of symptoms
associated with “general exhaustion,” according to the
statement. Odinga shares power with Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki .
