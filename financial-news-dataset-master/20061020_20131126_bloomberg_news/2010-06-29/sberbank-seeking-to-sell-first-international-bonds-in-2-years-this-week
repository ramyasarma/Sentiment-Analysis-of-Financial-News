             OAO Sberbank  may sell its first
international bonds in two years this week after postponing the
offering last month because of Europe’s debt crisis, according
to two people with knowledge of the sale.  
 Russia’s biggest lender hired DZ Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc for the sale of five-
year bonds in dollars, the people said. Chief Financial Officer
 Anton Karamzin  said June 1 the bank may issue $1 billion of
bonds.  
 Sberbank, which cited market volatility caused by Europe’s
debt crisis as the reason for delay, is one of at least four
Russian companies seeking to sell international bonds this week
as borrowing conditions improve. Emerging-market companies are
returning to international debt markets after sales evaporated
in May amid concerns European fiscal problems may derail the
economic recovery.  
 “There is always a lag between market price action and the
bond pipeline,” said  Luis Costa , an emerging-market debt
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London. The offerings this week
are a reaction to “the improvement in emerging-markets spreads
a couple of weeks ago,” he said.  
 Vnesheconombank, the state development bank,  OAO
Promsvyazbank , Russia’s third-biggest private lender, and
TransCreditBank, the lending arm of the country’s railroad
monopoly, are seeking to sell international debt this week.  
 Sberbank sold $500 million of 6.468 percent, five-year
notes in June 2008 in its most recent sale of foreign-currency
debt, Bloomberg data show. Sberbank debt is rated BBB by Fitch
Ratings.
