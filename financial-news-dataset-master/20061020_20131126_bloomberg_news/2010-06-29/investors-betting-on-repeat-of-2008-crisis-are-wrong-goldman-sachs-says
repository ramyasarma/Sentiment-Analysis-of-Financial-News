             Investors are wrong when they bet on
the parallels between the current sovereign bond crisis and the
fallout from the 2008 meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market,
according to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc .  
 Countries that have more ways to raise revenues than
corporations, a growing economy, more savvy politicians,
healthier private balance sheets and banks holding $1.2 trillion
in liquidity versus $200 billion in 2008 make the current
sovereign debt problems less contagious than the subprime
mortgage-induced crisis two years ago,  Alberto Gallo  and  Annie Chu , New York-based strategists with Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
note today.  
 “The market-wide systemic risk priced by the market is now
far worse than what economic data suggests,” the two analysts
wrote. “The current environment is different from the mortgage
crisis. Headline risk will likely remain high for the upcoming
weeks, but beyond that we see stability for bondholders.”
