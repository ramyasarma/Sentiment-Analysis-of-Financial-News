             Japan’s stock market will experience
high volatility for years as repercussions from Europe’s debt
crisis rattle investor confidence, State Street Corp. said.  
 The Nikkei-225 Stock Average’s historical implied 50-day
 volatility  rose on June 25 to the highest level in a year,
according to Bloomberg data. The stock benchmark has posted
monthly  gains  or declines of at least 10 percent six times since
January 2008. A move of that magnitude occurred only once from
January 2000 to December 2007, Bloomberg data show.  
 Large swings have occurred recently as global economies
were hit by the collapse of New York-based Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., a stimulus-spending fuelled equity rally, and a
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe that arose because of that
spending.  
 “The effects of such big corrections of markets and
economies won’t dissipate easily,”  Hideki Takayama , chief
investment officer for State Street Global Advisors (Japan) Co.,
which manages $85.5 billion in assets in Tokyo, said in an
interview on June 18. Unusual volatility “will last for a while,
which is measured by years.”  
 The Nikkei 225 plummeted by a  record  42 percent in 2008
after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September of that year.
It climbed to a 52-week high on April 5 and has since tumbled 16
percent amid concern Greece and other European countries will
struggle to curb their budget deficits.  
 Uncertainty over the extent of the euro zone’s debt
problems continues to weigh on investor sentiment, said Takayama.
On the positive side, economies elsewhere are recovering, he
said.  
 “Economies in the U.S. and emerging nations excluding the
euro region are improving,” he said. “ Corporate earnings  are
also recovering.”  
 The Nikkei 225 may climb to 11,500 by the end of this year,
said Takayama. The gauge closed at 9,693.94 on June 28.
