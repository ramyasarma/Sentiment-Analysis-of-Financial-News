             Japanese  stocks  fell, reversing
gains this morning and putting the Topix index on course for its
sixth consecutive drop, on concern over China’s economic growth
and as the stronger yen hurt exporters.  
 Komatsu Ltd., which counts China as its fastest-growing
market, dropped 0.2 percent when markets reopened after the
midday break, reversing a 2 percent gain this morning. Honda
Motor Co., which gets more than 80 percent of its sales abroad,
fell 0.9 percent. Inpex Corp., Japan’s biggest oil explorer,
sank 3.1 percent as crude-oil prices retreated.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.5 percent to 9,647.37
as of 12:43 p.m. in Tokyo following a 0.7 percent gain this
morning. The broader Topix dropped 0.3 percent to 857.99. About
four stocks declined for every three that advanced.  
 The yen surged during the midday break and strengthened to
as much as 109.04 against the euro from 110.65 at the close of
stock trading in Tokyo yesterday. Against the dollar, the yen
appreciated to as much as 88.89 from 89.37. A stronger yen
reduces the value of overseas income for Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.
