             HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s third-
largest lender by market value, said the shift to using the new
base-rate system for pricing loans may affect short-term
corporate credit growth.  
 Growth in the lender’s consumer loans will accelerate this
year from the previous, and expansion in corporate loans will
exceed retail loan growth, Executive Director Paresh Sukthankar
said in Mumbai today.
