             U.S. stocks extended declines,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index below its 2010 closing
low, after a gauge of consumer confidence trailed economists’
estimates and concern grew that growth is slowing in China.  
 The S&P 500 tumbled 2.3 percent to 1,049.47 at 10:03 p.m.
in New York, below its lowest closing level since November 2009.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 222.95 points, or 2.2
percent, to 9,915.57.  
 The Conference Board’s confidence index slumped to 52.9
this month from a revised 62.7 in May, figures from the New
York-based private research group showed today. The median
forecast called for a decline to 62.5, and the gauge was lower
than all projections in a Bloomberg News survey of 71
economists.
