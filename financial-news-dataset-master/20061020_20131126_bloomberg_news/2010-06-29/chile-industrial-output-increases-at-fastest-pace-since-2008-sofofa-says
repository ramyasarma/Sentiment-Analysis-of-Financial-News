             Chilean industrial production rose
2.1 percent in May from a year earlier, the fastest expansion
since September 2008, manufacturing association Sofofa said.  
 Output increased 7.4 percent from April on a seasonally
adjusted basis, the group said today in e-mailed statement. The
National Statistics Institute will publish  output  data tomorrow.  
 Chilean factories are recovering from the impact of a
devastating and deadly earthquake on Feb. 27 that caused output
to drop 17 percent in March.  
 “This confirms that we should have a similar or greater
industrial production figure tomorrow, which in turn indicates
economic activity growing at around 6 percent,” said  Jorge Selaive , chief economist at BCI Corredor de Bolsa in Santiago.
“That illustrates the recovery of the Chilean economy.”  
 The earthquake “is an old story now,” he said. The
8.8-magnitude temblor, the world’s fifth-largest in a century,
struck as South America’s fifth-largest economy was emerging
from a  recession  that saw industrial output shrink year-on-year
for 13 straight months from September 2008 to October 2009,
according to Sofofa figures.  
 Industrial sales dropped 5.6 percent in May from a year
earlier, led by a 42 percent fall in sales of refined oil
products, Sofofa said.  
 The government may report tomorrow that output increased
4.4 percent in May on an annual basis, the fastest year-on-year
growth since April 2008, according to the median  forecast  of 11
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
