             Caixa Economica Federal  may buy a 
stake in a private credit-card company to enter the business 
and sell to low-income consumers,  O Estado de S. Paulo  
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The Brazilian lender plans to announce a deal by the end of
the year, the newspaper said, citing Chief Executive Officer 
Maria Fernanda Coelho. Caixa wants to offer a credit card to 
compete with the Visa and MasterCard brands, Estado cited 
Coelho as saying.  
 One of Caixa’s options is Hipercard, the brand owned by 
Itau Unibanco Holding SA, the newspaper said. Coelho declined 
to confirm the bank is interested in Hipercard.  
 Coelho also said credit-card interest rates are unlikely to
fall “abruptly” in Brazil, according to the newspaper.
