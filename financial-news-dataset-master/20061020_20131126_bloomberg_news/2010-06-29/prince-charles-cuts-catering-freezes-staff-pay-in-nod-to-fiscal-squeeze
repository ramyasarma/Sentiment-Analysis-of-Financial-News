             Prince Charles  cut costs for
entertaining by more than half and slashed spending on his
office in response to the recession that hit the U.K. economy.  
 Annual accounts released by the heir to the British throne
today showed the amount spent on official entertaining and
receptions fell to 2.5 million pounds ($3.8 million) from 5.3
million pounds in the year to March 31. Meanwhile pay for the
prince’s 124 employees totaled 6 million pounds, almost the same
as the previous 12 months.  
 “We are always keeping an eye on the economic climate,”
Charles’s principal private secretary,  Michael Peat,  told
reporters in London. “We do live in the real world -- for the
most part anyhow.”  
 Peat said the reduction in costs had been achieved by
renegotiating contracts with outside caterers and by staging
different types of receptions and was not the result of less
costly dishes being served.  
 Charles, whose official title is the Prince of Wales,
earned 17.2 million pounds in the year to March 31, an increase
of 4.3 percent. The accounts did not give a breakdown of the
earnings. The Duchy of Cornwall estate, which provides the
prince’s income, owns around 54,090 hectares of land in 23
counties, according to its  website .  
 “The financial results are considered to be satisfactory
in what has been a difficult market,” according to the report
accompanying the accounts. “The capital account has also
performed well in all property classes.”  
 ‘Heady Days’  
 “In the heady days when the banks and property companies
were making vast returns we didn’t make vast returns,” Peat
said. “But when times get tough we carry on and still make a
decent surplus. Charles prefers steady progress, not dashing to
the heights and plunging to the depths.”  
 Payments from the U.K. government for carrying out his
royal duties fell 49 percent to 1.1 million pounds.  
 “Most of that money is spent on overseas travel that the
prince and the Duchess of Cornwall undertake at the request of
the government, so it depends where the government wants them to
go,” Peat said. “Last year the main long-haul trip they did
was to Canada, which was paid for by the Canadians, so it didn’t
fall as a cost to British public funds.”  
 The prince’s household is working on building up its
capital reserves. Peat declined to name an exact figure, saying
the household is working toward a figure to match annual
expenditure. In the fiscal year through March that was 10.7
million pounds.  
 Peat also said the prince’s household is testing an
electric car made by  BMW AG ’s Mini division for possible future
use.
