             An advertising campaign against the
Australian government’s proposed super-profits mining tax may
resume next week should talks for an accord stall, the
Association of Mining and Exploration Companies said.  
 “We gave them two weeks from last Friday to resolve this
matter or we will restart our advertizing,” Simon Bennison,
chief executive officer of the association, said in a phone
interview from Perth today, citing July 9 as the deadline. “We
are concerned the government is going to drag it out, have an
election, and there won’t be a resolution on this tax for quite
a number of months.”  
 Australia’s Prime Minister  Julia Gillard , who ousted  Kevin Rudd  last week, vowed to resolve a stand off with mining
companies over the super-profits tax proposal. BHP Billiton Ltd.
and Rio Tinto Group, the world’s largest and third-largest
mining companies, suspended their anti-tax advertising as a sign
of good faith after her appointment.  
 “The government is negotiating and is very focused on
reaching a genuine outcome about the resources super profits
tax,” Gillard said on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio today.
“The mining industry wants to see us strong and prosperous into
the future and we want to see Australians getting a fairer share.
I think we can find a meeting of minds here.”  
 Deputy Prime Minister  Wayne Swan  and Resources Minister
 Martin Ferguson  will meet with senior mining executives tomorrow,
the Australian newspaper said today, without saying where it got
the information.  
 BHP Billiton spokesman Illtud Harri declined to comment and
Rio Tinto spokesman  David Luff  was not immediately available to
comment.

                          June 29 (Bloomberg) -- Belinda Allen, an analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset Management, talks from Sydney with Bloomberg's Susan Li about the outlook for the Australian government's planned resources tax under the leadership of Prime Minister Julia Gillard.
     As soon as Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd as prime minister on June 24, she vowed to resolve a standoff over his proposed 40 percent mining tax on what he called "super" profits. (Source: Bloomberg)
