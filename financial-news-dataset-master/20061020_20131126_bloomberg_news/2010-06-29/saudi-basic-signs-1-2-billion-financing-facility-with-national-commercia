             Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the
world’s largest petrochemicals company, got a 4.5 billion-riyal
($1.2 billion) credit facility to finance expansion plans as
bank lending recovers in the Arab world’s biggest economy.  
 Riyadh-based  Sabic  signed the agreement with National
Commercial Bank, the company said in a statement on the Saudi
bourse  website  today. The financing “contributes to the
company’s strategy of expansion and growth,” it said.  
 Sabic has tapped financing from local banks after
postponing a bond sale last month by its Sabic Capital unit and
as bank lending improves in the world’s largest oil supplier. On
June 16, Sabic signed an agreement for a 3.75 billion-riyal
credit facility with  Alinma Bank .  
 Saudi bank lending to businesses rose in May at the fastest
pace for nine months, indicating a gradual return to credit
availability. Lending to the private sector increased an annual
3.9 percent in May, up from 2.4 percent in April, the  Saudi
Arabian Monetary Agency , the country’s central bank, said on its
website on June 27.  
 “A series of new financing deals concluded and in the
pipeline continue to support improvement in Saudi bank private
sector credit growth,”  John Sfakianakis , chief economist at
Riyadh-based Banque Saudi Fransi, wrote in a report on June 28.
“While the government has been shouldering the financing burden
for strategic projects in the past year and half, banks look
poised to take a greater slice from now on as they abandon some
risk aversion.”
