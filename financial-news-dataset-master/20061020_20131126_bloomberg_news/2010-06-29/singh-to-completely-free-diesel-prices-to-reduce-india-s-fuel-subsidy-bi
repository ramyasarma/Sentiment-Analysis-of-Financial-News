             India will completely free diesel
prices from government control following last week’s
deregulation of gasoline rates to reduce the nation’s subsidy
bill, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said.  
 “The fact that petrol prices have been set free, the same
is going to be done to diesel prices,” Singh told reporters
while returning from the Group of 20 meeting, according to an e-
mailed statement from the government today. “Subsidies for the
petroleum products have reached a level which is not connected
to sound financial management of our economy.”  
 India increased diesel prices by 2 rupees (4 cents), or 5.2
percent, a liter on June 25 and will eventually free the fuel
from state control, according to Oil Secretary  S. Sundareshan .
Gasoline prices were fully deregulated and rates for cooking
fuel and kerosene were increased.  
 The changes were “much-needed reforms,” Singh said.  
 The government aims to cut the budget deficit to 5.5
percent of gross domestic product in the year ending March from
an estimated 6.9 percent last year. India’s economy, Asia’s
biggest after Japan and China, grew 8.6 percent in the three
months ended March 31.  
 India gave 260 billion rupees as compensation to state-run
refineries including  Indian Oil Corp. , the nation’s second-
largest, in the year ended March 31 as partial compensation for
selling fuels below costs.
