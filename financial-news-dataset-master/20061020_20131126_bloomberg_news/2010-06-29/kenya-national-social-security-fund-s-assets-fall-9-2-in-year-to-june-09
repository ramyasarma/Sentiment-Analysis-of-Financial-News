             Kenya’s  National Social Security
Fund , the state-run pension company, said its assets retreated
9.2 percent in the year through June 2009 as the value of stocks
declined.  
 Assets fell to 82.15 billion shillings ($1.01 billion) from
90.51 billion shillings a year earlier, according to a statement
published in the Nairobi-based  Daily Nation  newspaper today.  
 The “net loss in scheme funds was 7.41 billion shillings
as compared to net surplus of 9.01 billion shillings in 2008,
due largely to the global financial meltdown that triggered a
10.85 billion-shilling unrealized loss in market value of
equities,” the statement said.  
 The  Nairobi Stock Exchange’s All-Share Index  fell 33
percent in the year through June 2009.  
 Investments declined to 80.17 billion shillings from 87.53
billion shillings while investment income slipped 9.3 percent to
4.57 billion as “fewer sales transactions were concluded at the
Nairobi Stock Exchange due to falling equity prices in 2009,”
according to the statement.  
 The three biggest classes of investments are stocks at
39.47 percent followed by real estate at 34.51 percent and
government securities at 20.07 percent, the fund said on its
website.  
 Contributions from members rose 11.4 percent to 6.32
billion shillings. In 2009 there were approximately 10.4 million
 Kenyans  in employment, according to the latest economic survey
released in May. Membership of the fund is compulsory for all
Kenyan employees.  
 On average, every employee pays about 5 percent of their
monthly salary into the fund, which is then matched by their
employers, according to the fund’s website.
