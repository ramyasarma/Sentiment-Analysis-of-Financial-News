             Gramercy, a Greenwich, Connecticut-
based investment firm with more than $2.6 billion in assets,
hired  Jeffrey Grills  and  Gunter Heiland  to help manage emerging-
market debt.  
 Grills and Heiland, who as co-heads of emerging-market debt
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed as much as $12 billion, will
help oversee investments in government and corporate bonds in
local and international markets, Gramercy said in a statement.
They will report to Gramercy founder and Chief Investment
Officer  Robert Koenigsberger . Grills, 38, and Heiland, 43, left
JPMorgan in October.  
 “We’ll continue to work within one unified investment
committee process,” Koenigsberger said in a telephone interview
from San Diego.  
 The appointments follow Gramercy’s swap of its Argentine
bond holdings in a restructuring of the country’s defaulted debt
that ended last week. The firm was part of a group of
institutional investors that approached the Argentine government
via a “reverse inquiry” to restructure the nation’s $18.3
billion worth of defaulted securities, Koenigsberger said.
Gramercy had “in excess of 10 percent” of the defaulted bonds,
he said.  
 Creditors holding about $12.1 billion of eligible defaulted
debt, or 66 percent of the total, tendered their securities in
the restructuring, Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  said June 23.
