             Russia’s Vera Zvonareva beat
Belgium’s Kim Clijsters in three sets today to reach the
semifinals at the Wimbledon tennis championship.  
 Zvonareva, who had never previously been beyond the fourth
round, won 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 against two-time semifinalist
Clijsters, who was playing at Wimbledon for a first time since
2006.  
 Clijsters had won their five previous meetings.
