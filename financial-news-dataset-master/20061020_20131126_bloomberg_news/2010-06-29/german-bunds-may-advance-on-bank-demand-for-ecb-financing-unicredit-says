             German bonds may rise, and debt from
peripheral euro-area nations may drop, should bank demand for
European Central Bank funding hold steady as one-year loans come
due this week, UniCredit SpA said.  
 “A large rollover would benefit bunds and put pressure on
yields of countries that, in recent months, have relied more on
ECB funding, Spain and Portugal in the first place,”  Luca Cazzulani , senior fixed-income strategist in Milan, said today
in a research report.  
 A low level of rollover would reduce “safe-haven demand”
for the German securities, he said.
