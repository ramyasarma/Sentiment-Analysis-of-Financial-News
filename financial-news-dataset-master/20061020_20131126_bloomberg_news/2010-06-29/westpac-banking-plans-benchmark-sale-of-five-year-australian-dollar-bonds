             Westpac Banking Corp. plans to sell
five-year Australian dollar-denominated bonds, according to an
e-mailed statement from the lender.  
 The sale will be benchmark in size and Westpac is marketing
the notes to yield 135 basis points more than the swap and bank
bill swap rates, according to the statement. Benchmark typically
means at least A$500 million.
