             Japan’s government probably sold
fewer bonds than the Finance Ministry forecast last fiscal year
as the economic recovery spurred  tax revenue .  
 Bond sales are likely to total 52 trillion yen ($584
billion) for the year ended March 31, about 1.5 trillion yen
less than forecast, the ministry said in figures released in
Tokyo today.  
 Tax revenue in the period probably reached 38.8 trillion
yen, exceeding the government’s estimate by 1.9 trillion yen,
Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said at a news conference today.
Final calculations are scheduled to be made next month.  
 Japan emerged from its worst postwar recession in April
2009, led by a revival of exports.
