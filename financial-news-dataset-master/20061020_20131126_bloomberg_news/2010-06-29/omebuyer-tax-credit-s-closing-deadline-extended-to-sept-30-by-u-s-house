             The U.S. House of Representatives
voted to give homebuyers who qualified for a federal tax credit
more time to settle on their pending purchases.  
 The House voted 409-5 to extend the deadline for closing
home purchases to Sept. 30. The program initially required
borrowers who signed contracts before April 30 to complete
paperwork by July 1 to get a tax credit of as much as $8,000.  
 The House measure accommodates borrowers at risk of being
disqualified for the tax credit because lenders and loan
servicers aren’t processing mortgages quickly enough. The Senate
is considering similar legislation.  
 “We owe this to the people who have essentially followed
the rule who are caught by a closing date,” House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman  Sander Levin , a Michigan Democrat, said
before the vote.  
 As many as 180,000 homebuyers would lose their tax credit
if Congress fails to push back the date, according to the
National Association of Realtors, which sought the extension.
Transactions at risk include as many as 75,000 short sales, or
homes being purchased for less than the existing debt on them.  
 The tax credit may have fueled a temporary increase in home
sales, which fell after the April deadline passed. New-home
sales dropped 33 percent to a record low of 300,000 in May, the
Commerce Department reported. Applications for loans to purchase
properties fell at the end of May to the lowest level since
1997, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
