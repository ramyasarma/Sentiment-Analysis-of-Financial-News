                          June 28 (Bloomberg) -- Kenneth DeWoskin, a director of Deloitte LLP's China Research and Insight Center, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about trade negotiations between China and Taiwan. 
     Taiwan and China aim to sign three agreements in a sixth round of cross-strait talks that will be held later this year, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation, said. Cross-strait negotiations resumed in 2008 after a nine-year halt during which former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui described the talks as "state-to-state," a term Beijing rejected. China claims the self-ruled island as its territory and has threatened force to impose Taiwan’s unification with the mainland. (Source: Bloomberg)
