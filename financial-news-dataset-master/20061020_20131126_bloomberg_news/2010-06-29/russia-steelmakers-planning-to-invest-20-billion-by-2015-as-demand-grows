             Russian steelmakers will invest
about $20 billion by 2015 as demand recovers, OAO Severstal
Chief Executive Officer Alexei Mordashov said.  
 Production will recover to the peak level of 2007 no
earlier than 2012 as the government sponsors infrastructure
projects and international automakers localize production,
Mordashov told Metal Bulletin’s Russian Steel conference in
Moscow today. Domestic consumption fell 27 percent and output
declined 12 percent last year, he said.  
 The country’s steelmakers, who turned to exports to boost
revenue as domestic use dropped, are looking to the “new
frontiers” of Sub-Saharan Africa, India and Asia, he said.
