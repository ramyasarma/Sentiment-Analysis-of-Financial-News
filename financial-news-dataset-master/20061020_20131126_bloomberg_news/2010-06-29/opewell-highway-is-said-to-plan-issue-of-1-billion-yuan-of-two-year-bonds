             Hopewell Highway Infrastructure Ltd. ,
controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Gordon Wu , will sell at
least 1 billion yuan ($147 million) in two-year yuan-denominated
bonds in July, according to a person with direct knowledge of
the matter.  
 The bonds will be issued to institutional investors in Hong
Kong, the company said in a statement June 27, without giving an
amount. Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. was named as the sole
bookrunner.  
 The notes will be the first yuan bonds sold offshore by a
non-financial Hong Kong-based company, Hopewell Highway
spokeswoman Sukyi Yau said by telephone yesterday. China, the
world’s third-largest economy, is seeking to promote the yuan as
a global currency and increase its use in cross-border trade.  
 The company operates expressways and other infrastructure
in southern China’s Pearl River Delta region.
