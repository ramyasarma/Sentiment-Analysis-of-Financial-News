             China’s banks fell the most in five
weeks on concern Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s initial
public offering may divert investor funds away from other
lenders during a slump in the nation’s equity markets.  
 A gauge of lenders in the CSI 300 Index retreated 4 percent
at 2:39 p.m., the most since May 17. Industrial & Commercial
Bank of China Ltd. slid 3.1 percent to 4.13 yuan. Bank of China
Ltd. lost 2.3 percent to 3.47 yuan.  
 “There remains uncertainty over the magnitude of a
slowdown in Chinese growth and the Agricultural Bank share sale
also mopped up quite a bit of liquidity,” said Michael Liang,
chief investment officer at Foundation Asset Management (HK)
Ltd., which oversees $120 million.
