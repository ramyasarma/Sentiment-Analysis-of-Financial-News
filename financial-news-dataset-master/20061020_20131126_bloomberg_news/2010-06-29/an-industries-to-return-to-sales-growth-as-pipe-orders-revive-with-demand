             Man Industries (India) Ltd. , a pipe
maker whose clients include monopoly gas distributor GAIL India
Ltd., expects sales to return to growth this year as it gets 25
percent more orders.  
 “Probably in next two months we will have a good position
in GAIL,” Managing Director  Jagdish Mansukhani  said in an
interview today. The company has tendered for pipeline contracts
with GAIL and expects to win a $100 million order at “any
moment” from another company he declined to name.  
 Man Industries shares have surged 60 percent as customers
including  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. , India’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, and GAIL expand to meet increasing demand in
Asia’s third-largest energy consumer. The $1.2 trillion economy
may expand 9 percent next year, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said on June 23, boosting fuel consumption.  
 Man Industries expects sales growth of 25 percent in the
year through March 31, Mansukhani said. Sales fell 20 percent
last year.  
 GAIL is seeking bids by July 26 for rig contractors to
explore for oil and gas in northwestern Rajasthan state, it said
in a tender document yesterday. ONGC plans to spend 45.8 billion
rupees ($984 million) to hire 14 land and offshore rigs, Mint
newspaper reported today, citing an official it didn’t name.
