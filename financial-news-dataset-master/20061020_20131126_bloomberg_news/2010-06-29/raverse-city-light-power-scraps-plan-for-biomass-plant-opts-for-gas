                  June 28 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- Traverse City
Light & Power, the Michigan-based municipal utility, has put on
hold plans to replace a coal-fired power plant with a biomass
project and is studying building a natural gas plant instead.  
 The wood-fueled, 10-megawatt plant would have helped
 Traverse City Light & Power  meet its previously announced goal
of meeting 30 percent of electricity requirements with renewable
energy by 2020, the company said in a press release. Its board
will hold a session to discuss the shift in direction and re-
evaluate strategic goals in July.  
 “We’ve listened to many of our ratepayers tell us they
don’t know enough about biomass and some have suggested they are
more comfortable with natural gas as a power generation resource,
even though natural gas is not a renewable energy,” said
Chairman Mike Coco.  
 In a survey commissioned by the utility released in April
2010, 53.5 percent of local resident and business respondents
said that they supported the project.  
 Michigan’s renewable portfolio standard, which requires
that utilities derive 10 percent of their power from renewable
sources by 2015, would be “met without difficultly,” Executive
Director Ed Rice said in the statement.  
 The utility’s agreements to buy power from the
nearby Heritage Stoney Corners Wind Farm and 2 megawatts of
power from landfill gas plants that will be built by Granger
Electric should be sufficient to meet the renewable benchmark,
Rice said.
