             Swatch Group AG , the Swiss-based
watchmaker, denied a report in the magazine  Bilanz  that Chief
Executive Officer  Nick Hayek Jr.  will succeed his late father
Nicolas as chairman of the company.  
 “The meeting of the board will take place only tomorrow”
and no decision had been made on a successor, Swatch spokeswoman
 Beatrice Howald  said today, commenting on the Bilanz report in a
telephone interview from Biel, Switzerland.  
 The elder Hayek, a businessman of Lebanese origin credited
with reviving the Swiss watch industry from Japanese
competition, died yesterday of heart failure at age 82 while at
work, the maker of Omega timepieces said in a statement.  
 Swatch  dropped  5.6 percent to 307.20 francs ($283.81) today
in Zurich trading, the stock’s largest drop in eight months.  
 Hayek gained fame in Switzerland when he was hired to
advise two Swiss watchmakers on the verge of bankruptcy amid
competition from cheaper, Japanese-made watches. He recommended
that the companies, which owned Omega, Longines and Tissot,
merge and develop a low-cost watch called Swatch that
consumers might buy in addition to their more expensive ones.
By 1992, 100 million Swatches had been produced.  
 Hayek received France’s Legion d’Honneur in 2003 for his
services to watchmaking.
