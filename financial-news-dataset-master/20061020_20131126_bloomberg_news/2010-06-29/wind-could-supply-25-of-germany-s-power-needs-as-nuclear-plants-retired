             Germany can generate 25 percent of
its electricity from wind by 2020 if the government sticks to
its plan of phasing out nuclear power, the nation’s wind
industry lobby group said.  
 Wind turbines onshore may reach 45,000 megawatts of
installed power capacity, while offshore equipment will provide
another 10,000 megawatts a decade from now, BWE said today in an
e-mailed statement.  
 Germany’s coalition government is debating an extension to
the planned phase-out of the country’s 17 nuclear power plants.
Under an existing law, most of the plants will be shut down a
decade from now.
