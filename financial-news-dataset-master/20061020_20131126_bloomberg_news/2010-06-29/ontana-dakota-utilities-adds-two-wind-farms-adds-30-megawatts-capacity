                  June 28 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- Montana-Dakota
Utilities Co., a division of  MDU Resources , has commissioned two
new wind farms in Montana and North Dakota, adding 30 megawatts
to the company’s power generation capacity.  
 The 19.5 megawatt Cedar Hills wind farm near Rhame, North
Dakota and a 10.5 megawatt expansion to the Diamond Willow
project near Baker, Montana have entered commercial operation,
the utility said in a statement published on Business Wire.  
 Both projects are located on leased land. The first 18
megawatt phase of Diamond Willow started operating in 2007.

date in wind generation and other renewable energy projects to
serve its customers in Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota.
