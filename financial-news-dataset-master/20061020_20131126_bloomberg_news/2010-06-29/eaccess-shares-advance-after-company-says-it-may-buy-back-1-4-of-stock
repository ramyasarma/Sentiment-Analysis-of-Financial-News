             EAccess Ltd. , a Japanese provider of
broadband Internet service, was headed for its biggest gain in
almost a month in Tokyo trading after the company said it will
buy back as much as 1.4 percent of its outstanding stock.  
 The shares  rose 3.3 percent to 59,600 yen as of 9:52 a.m.
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, set for the biggest advance since
June 4. The benchmark Topix index added 0.4 percent.  
 EAccess will spend as much as 3 billion yen ($33.6 million)
to buy about 50,000 of its own shares, the Tokyo-based company
said in a statement today. The purchase will take place between
July 1 and October 31, it said.
