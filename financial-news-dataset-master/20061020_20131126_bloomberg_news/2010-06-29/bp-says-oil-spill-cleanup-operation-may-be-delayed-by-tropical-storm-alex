             BP Plc’s efforts to contain the
largest oil spill in U.S. history were disrupted as Tropical
Storm Alex strengthened in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Skimming and burning of oil off Louisiana’s coast was
suspended as seas reached 6 to 7 feet with winds up to 23 knots,
said Barbara Voulgaris, a spokeswoman for the Unified Command of
BP and government officials overseeing the spill response. Alex,
the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, forced
BP,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  and other companies to evacuate rigs
and platforms in the western Gulf as a safety precaution.  
 “Seas are pretty rough,” Voulgaris said today in a
telephone interview. High winds also prevented flights to spray
dispersant chemicals on the oil slick, which is in the northern
and eastern Gulf, she said.  
 BP has been collecting gushing oil from its Macondo well
through two systems feeding crude to the Discoverer Enterprise
and the Q4000 drilling rigs. Work on a relief well that aims to
plug Macondo continued today amid thunderstorms and rough seas,
said Chuck Wolf, another spokesman for the spill response.  
 BP needs about three more days to connect a cap that will
carry crude from the leaking well to the Helix Producer, a
vessel that can collect an additional 20,000 to 25,000 barrels
of oil a day, said  Kent Wells , a senior vice president for the
company. Rising waves caused by the storm may slow the pace of
that work, he said.  
 Flat Sea Needed  
 “This is very precise work,” Wells said on a conference
call yesterday. “A lot of it’s done on the surface and we
require a flat sea state to do that work.”  
 BP will be able to collect as much as 53,000 barrels a day
with the connection of the well to the Helix Producer. An April
20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11
workers and triggered the spill, which is spewing as much as
60,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf.  
 The company planned to boost its recovery capacity to
53,000 barrels a day by June 30 and to 80,000 barrels a day by
mid-July, according to a June 13 report submitted to President
 Barack Obama ’s administration. It’s drilling two relief wells to
permanently seal the leak. BP has already spent $2.65 billion
responding to the spill.  
 The company collected or burned 23,395 barrels of leaking
oil from Macondo yesterday, according to an  update  on BP’s
website. That was down from 24,450 barrels on June 27.  
 BP fell 1.7 percent to 302.9 pence in London. The cost of
insuring BP debt approached a record, with credit-default swaps
increasing 3.5 basis points to 587.4, according to CMA
DataVision. The contracts closed at an all-time high of 588.6 on
June 25.
