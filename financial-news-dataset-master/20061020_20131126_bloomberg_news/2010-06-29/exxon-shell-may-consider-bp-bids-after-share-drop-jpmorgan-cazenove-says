             Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc  may consider bidding for  BP Plc  after the London-based
oil company lost more than half of its market value in the wake
of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. said.  
 Exxon Mobil has the stronger balance sheet and proven
ability to integrate a large transaction, according to  Fred Lucas , a London-based analyst at JP Morgan. It could make a cash
and share offer, valuing BP at 473 pence a share compared with
yesterday’s close of 308.25 pence, and including a $50 billion
spin-off of BP’s downstream assets, according to JPMorgan.  
 BP’s market value has collapsed by more than $100 billion
since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that killed 11 crew members and caused the leak.
The company has set aside $20 billion to pay for Gulf
restoration and compensation claims and said yesterday the cost
of battling the spill had reached $2.65 billion.  
 Any potential attempt to buy BP would have to be backed by
“ruthless integration,” JPMorgan said. BP has many high
quality assets, including deepwater positions and upstream
operations, Lucas wrote under a future possible scenario.  
 Sheila Williams , a spokeswoman for BP, declined to comment,
as did Kim Blomley, a London-based spokesman for Shell.
