             Concern among European businesses in
China about rising labor costs and competition with domestic
rivals is increasing, according to a survey conducted by the
European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.  
 A slowdown in China’s and the global economy continues to
be the biggest concern for European business in the nation,
according the survey of 514 respondents distributed today at a
briefing in Beijing. Concern about an economic slowdown is
easing as compared with last year, according to the survey.  
 China may also be losing “some of its luster” as an
investment location for European companies, the chamber said.
The survey found that 30 percent of respondents identified China
as currently the world’s top investment destination. When asked
how China may rank in five years, only 21 percent said it would
be the top investment destination, according to the survey.
