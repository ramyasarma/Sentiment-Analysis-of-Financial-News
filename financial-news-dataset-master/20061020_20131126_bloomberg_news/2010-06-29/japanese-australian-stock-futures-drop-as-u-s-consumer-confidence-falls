             Japanese and Australian  stock 
futures declined after a measure of U.S. consumer confidence
fell more than analysts forecast, boosting investors’ concern
about an economic recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  
 American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co., a carmaker
that gets more than 80 percent of its sales abroad, lost 2.5
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Canon Inc., a
camera maker that counts Europe as its biggest market, dropped
2.3 percent as the yen strengthened. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. ,
the world’s largest mining company, sank 2 percent from the
Sydney close after commodity prices tumbled.  
 “Investors are getting excessively anxious about the
future of the global economy,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities
manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. “The Japanese
market, which depends on the external environment, is likely to
start with a drop after the plunges in U.S. and European
stocks.”  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,345 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,545 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,360 in
Osaka, Japan, today at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 2.1 percent today. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 1.2 percent in Wellington.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  in the U.S. were
little changed today. In New York yesterday, the gauge retreated
3.1 percent to its lowest level since Oct. 30, after the New
York-based Conference Board cut its estimate for Chinese
economic growth.  
 Conference Board  
 The private research group also said yesterday that its
index of U.S. consumer confidence slumped to 52.9 this month,
below the lowest forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, from a revised 62.7 in May.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  lost 1.5 percent yesterday, the
biggest drop since June 7. The gauge has slumped 12 percent from
its high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis
and Chinese steps to curb property prices will hurt global
growth.  
 Companies in the MSCI Asia index trade at 14.1 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  
 The yen appreciated against the euro to as much as 107.78
today from 108.82 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo
yesterday. Against the dollar, the currency strengthened to as
much as 88.44 from 88.76. A stronger yen reduces the value of
overseas income for Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  
 Crude oil for August delivery fell 3 percent to settle at
$75.94 a barrel in New York yesterday, the biggest one-day drop
since June 4. The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals
including aluminum and copper tumbled 5.5 percent yesterday, its
biggest drop since May 17. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19
raw materials tumbled 2.8 percent, the most since Aug. 14. Only
gold climbed.
