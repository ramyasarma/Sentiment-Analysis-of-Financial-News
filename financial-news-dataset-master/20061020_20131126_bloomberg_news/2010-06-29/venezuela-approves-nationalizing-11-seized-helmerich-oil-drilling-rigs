             Venezuelan National Assembly
lawmakers approved nationalizing 11 oil rigs owned by  Helmerich
& Payne Inc.  after state oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA 
accused the U.S. company of a production “boycott.”  
 “We reviewed the report from the oil ministry and consider
the decision pertinent,”  Jesus Graterol , president of the
congressional energy commission, said today on  National Assembly 
Television. “The opposition wants multinational oil companies
to return to Venezuela and we won’t allow it to happen.”  
 Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Helmerich & Payne said that the rigs
were idled after Venezuela stopped paying for oil service
activities and accumulated a debt of more than $40 million.
Helmerich will be compensated for the rigs, Rafael Ramirez,
president of PDVSA, said on June 26.  
 President Hugo Chavez forced foreign oil producers into
joint ventures as minority partners in 2007 and is in
 international arbitration  hearings with the U.S.’s  Exxon Mobil
Corp . and  ConocoPhillips,  which rejected revised terms. Last
year, PDVSA seized assets from companies including  Williams Cos. 
as it increased state control over oil and gas operations.  
 Helmerich was “intransigent” in negotiating new fees and
was the only company of 33 rig providers to refuse the terms,
Ramirez said on June 25. PDVSA workers are guarding the rigs in
Anaco, Anzoategui state, he said.
