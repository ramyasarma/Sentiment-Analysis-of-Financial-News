             (Corrects Rabobank spelling in second paragraph.)  
 June 29 (Bloomberg) --  Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s biggest
bank, hired  Nick Hungate  as director of global agriculture
products in London and plans to expand agriculture trading.  
 Hungate, formerly executive director at Rabobank
International in London, will start July 7,  John Redpath ,
managing director and global head of oil and agriculture trading
at Deutsche Bank, said by phone from London yesterday. Deutsche
Bank is expanding the agriculture team in London, partly to meet
increased investor demand from Asia, he said.  
 “We are seeing better liquidity in European agricultural
futures exchanges such as Liffe,” Redpath said, referring to
the London exchange where cocoa, coffee and sugar trade. “We
would continue to expand the desk internationally.”  
 Asian investors have expanded their interest in agriculture
from edible oils and sugar to corn and soymeal as well,
according to Redpath, who has been in the commodities business
for 22 years. He declined to say how many people may be hired.  
 Deutsche Bank’s agriculture trading department manages
commodities such as cocoa, coffee, cotton, grains, oilseeds and
sugar.
