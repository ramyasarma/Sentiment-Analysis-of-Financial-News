             Dubai Aerospace Enterprise may defer
or cancel $29 billion of orders for 200 aircraft, divided 
equally between Airbus SAS and Boeing Co., the Wall Street 
Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the 
matter.   
 As an alternative, the state-controlled Dubai 
aircraft-leasing company may try to switch the orders to 
Emirates Airline and FlyDubai, the newspaper said.  
 The cancelation threat stems from Dubai’s parlous financial
state, the Journal said, adding that Dubai Aerospace, Airbus 
and Boeing all declined to comment.
