             General Electric Co.  failed to
convince a federal appeals court that the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency’s Superfund law governing cleanup of hazardous
waste sites is unconstitutional.  
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington sided with a lower court, rejecting the company’s
argument that the agency violated its due process rights under
the U.S. Constitution.  
 GE was contesting a provision of the Superfund law that
denies the company the ability to go to court to challenge the
government’s claims. The lawsuit was filed in 2000, before GE
agreed to and began to clean up 40-mile stretch of the Hudson
River polluted with polychlorinated biphenyl.  
 “GE is evaluating the decision and reviewing its
options,” said  Mark Behan , a spokesman for Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE. The ruling will have no effect on the
company’s dredging, where one phase of work was completed last
year and the next is scheduled to start in 2011, he said.  
 The case is General Electric Co. v. Jackson, 09-5092, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington).
