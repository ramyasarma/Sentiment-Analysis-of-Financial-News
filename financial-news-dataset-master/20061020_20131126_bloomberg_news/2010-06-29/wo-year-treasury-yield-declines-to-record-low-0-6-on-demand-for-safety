             Treasury two-year  yields  fell to a
record as investors sought the safety of U.S. government debt on
speculation the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at all-
time lows through 2010.  
 Yields declined to 0.6014 percent, less than the 0.6044
percent set Dec. 17, 2008. That figure was reached after policy
makers reduced the  target rate  for overnight loans between banks
to a range of zero to 0.25 percent and said they were
considering buying U.S. government debt to help revive the
financial markets.  
 “Fed tightening is being moved further and further out
into the future,” said  William O’Donnell , head U.S. government
bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Stamford,
Connecticut, one of 18 primary dealers that trade with the
central bank. “There are still headwinds out there. There’s no
glimmer of them even considering a tightening.”  
 Two-year notes are among the most sensitive to Fed rates
because of their short maturity. Their yield has fallen from its
high this year of 1.176 percent set in April as the fiscal
crisis in Europe, U.S. unemployment near 10 percent and signs
that inflation is slowing have added to concerns global economic
growth will falter.  
 Fed officials retained a pledge to keep their benchmark
rate at a record low for an “extended period” on June 23 and
signaled Europe’s debt crisis may harm U.S. growth. Policy
makers won’t raise borrowing costs until the first quarter of
next year, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.
