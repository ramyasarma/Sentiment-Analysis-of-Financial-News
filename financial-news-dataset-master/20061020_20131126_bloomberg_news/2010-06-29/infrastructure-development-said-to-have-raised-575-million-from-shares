             Infrastructure Development Finance
Co. , an Indian state-run lender for road, ports and power
projects, raised $575 million selling shares to institutional
investors, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  
 The company sold shares for 168.25 rupees each in a
transaction that closed today before markets opened in India,
according to the people, who declined to be identified before an
official announcement. Investors bid for twice the number of
shares on offer, allowing the company to raise the maximum
sought, the people said.  
 CLSA India Ltd., Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley and
IDFC Capital Ltd. managed the transaction, according to a sale
document obtained by Bloomberg News ahead of the deal’s
completion.  
 Mona Mohan, a spokeswoman for IDFC in Mumbai, didn’t
immediately return a call and e-mail seeking comment. Mandy Ho,
CLSA’s Hong Kong-based spokeswoman,  Nick Footitt , Morgan
Stanley’s spokesman in Hong Kong, and  Josephine Lee , a
spokeswoman for Credit Suisse, also didn’t immediately respond
to e-mails.
