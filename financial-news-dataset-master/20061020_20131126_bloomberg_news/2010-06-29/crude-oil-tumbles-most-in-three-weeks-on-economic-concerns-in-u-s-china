             Oil fell for a third day, the
longest losing streak in six weeks, on concern economic growth
in the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest users, will slow.  
 Oil extended yesterday’s 3 percent decline after the
Conference Board said its leading economic index for China rose
more slowly in April than previously estimated. The board’s U.S.
confidence index in June was lower than all forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Asian stocks  today dropped the most in
more than two weeks.  
 “Everyone understands now that it will take more time than
expected for the economy of America to get better,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity derivatives sales manager at broker
Newedge Group in Tokyo. “Oil is in a downtrend after it failed
to reach $80.”  
 Crude for August delivery fell as much as 61 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $75.33 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $75.71 at 1:52 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract declined $2.31 to $75.94,
the biggest one-day drop since June 4.  
 Oil, down 9.6 percent since the end of March, is heading
for its first quarterly decline since 2008. Futures have fallen
4.6 percent this year. The market is in the longest decline
since a six-day drop through May 18.  
 Technical Indicators  
 Crude has declined below technical indicators used by
analysts, according to Hasegawa at Newedge. Oil is below the 50-
day moving average at $76.30 a barrel, along with the 100-day at
$78.67 and 200-day at $77.18.  
 “This means we may fall further if some bearish news comes
into the market,” he said. “It looks weak technically.”  
 The measure of China’s economy compiled by the New York-
based Conference Board rose 0.3 percent in April, less than the
1.7 percent gain it reported June 15. The research group
corrected the outlook after a “calculation error” for total
floor space on which construction began.  
 “Crude has been shellacked due to confidence around the
world eroding,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director at
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney. “The revision in
confidence was a concern.”  
 The Conference Board reported its U.S.  confidence  index
slumped to 52.9 in June from a revised 62.7 in May, as Americans
became pessimistic about the outlook for the labor market and
the economy. The median forecast of 71 economists’ estimates in
the Bloomberg survey called for a decline to 62.5.  
 Asian equities fell for a second day, extending a global
rout after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped to its lowest
level since October. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1.4
percent to 112.42 as of 2:08 p.m. in Tokyo.  
 Hurricane Alex  
 Oil also dropped on predictions Hurricane Alex, moving west
across the southern Gulf of Mexico, will miss production areas.
The center of the storm, the earliest Atlantic hurricane since
1995, is forecast to make landfall in northeast Mexico or
southern Texas today, according to the U.S. National Hurricane
Center in Miami.  
 The storm has halted about 25 percent of oil production in
the Gulf of Mexico and 9 percent of natural-gas output, the U.S.
government said yesterday.  
 U.S. crude inventories declined 3.4 million barrels in the
week ended June 25, according to a report yesterday from the
industry-funded American Petroleum Institute.  
 Stockpiles  probably dropped  1 million barrels from 365.1
million the prior week, according to the median estimate from 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before an Energy Department
report today. That would be the first decline in three weeks.  
 Distillate Supplies  
 Distillate fuel supplies, including diesel and heating oil,
rose 4 million barrels to 158.7 million, the API said. That’s
the highest since the week to Feb. 19. Gasoline stockpiles fell
908,000 barrels to 220.2 million.  
 Oil-supply totals from the API and Energy Department moved
in the same direction 75 percent of the time over the past four
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Crude supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for
the New York futures, dropped 1.9 million barrels to 36 million,
according to the API data.  
 Brent crude for August delivery fell as much as 63 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $74.81 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was at $75.16 at 1:54 p.m. Singapore
time. The contract yesterday dropped $2.15, or 2.8 percent, to
$75.44, the lowest settlement since June 14.
