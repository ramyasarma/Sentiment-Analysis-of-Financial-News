             Investors should sell the Australian
dollar against the yen with a target of 72, UBS AG said.  
 The trade should be abandoned if the so-called Aussie rises
to 79.15, Mansoor Mohi-uddin, Singapore-based chief currency
strategist at UBS, said in an e-mailed note today.  
 “Investors are turning risk-averse amid fears over global
growth, month-end bond portfolio rebalancing, euro-zone bank
funding needs and Germany’s presidential election,” he said.
“While a double dip still seems unlikely, investors should be
wary of risk trades for now.”  
 The Aussie fell 1.9 percent to 76.51 as of 8:32 a.m. in
London.
