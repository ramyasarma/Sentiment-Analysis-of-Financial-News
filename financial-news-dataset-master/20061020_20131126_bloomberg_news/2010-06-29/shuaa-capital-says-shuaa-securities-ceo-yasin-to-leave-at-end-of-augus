             Shuaa Capital PSC,  the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest investment bank, said  Mohammed Ali Yasin ,
chief executive officer of its brokerage division, will leave
the company at the end of August.  
 A replacement for Yasin at Abu Dhabi-based Shuaa Securities
LLC will be announced “shortly,” the company said today in an
e-mailed statement.  
 “It’s time for me to take on a new challenge for the
future,” Yasin, 44, said by telephone from Abu Dhabi.  
 Yasin, who took over Shuaa’s brokerage business in 2006
after the company’s acquisition of Emirates Securities, will
explore opportunities in the financial industry in the U.A.E.
and Gulf Cooperation Council, he said.
