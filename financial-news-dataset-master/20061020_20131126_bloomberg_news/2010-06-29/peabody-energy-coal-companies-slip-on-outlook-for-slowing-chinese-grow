             Peabody Energy Corp. , the largest
U.S. coal mining company, led producers lower on concern that
economic growth in China is slowing, damping demand for the
power plant and steelmaking fuel.  
 Peabody dropped $2.57, or 6 percent, to $39.92 at 12:19
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. , the third-biggest U.S. coal company, lost $1.72,
or 4.7 percent, to $34.72.  Massey Energy Co. , the sixth-largest
U.S. coal producer, fell $1.51, or 5 percent, to $28.69.  
 The Conference Board’s April gauge for China’s economic
outlook indicated a weaker expansion. The gauge of the economy’s
outlook rose 0.3 percent, less than the 1.7 percent gain it
reported June 15. Coal companies have targeted the country as a
source of growth.  
 “I don’t know how much we can keep talking about the same
thing as a problem, but it is,” said  James Rollyson , an analyst
at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston.  
 Patriot Coal Corp. , the fourth-largest eastern U.S. coal
company, slipped 77 cents or 6 percent, to $12.20.  Walter Energy
Inc. , a southern Appalachia coal company, declined $3.35, or 5
percent, to $64.19.  Arch Coal Inc. , the second-biggest U.S. coal
company, tumbled $1.42, or 6.6 percent, to $20.18.  Consol Energy
Inc. , the coal and natural gas producer, plummeted $1.56, or 4.3
percent, to $34.74.  
 The companies also fell four days after China’s Natioanl
Development and Reform Commission, the country’s top economic
planner, ordered coal producers in the country to keep prices of
the fuel stable to stem inflation.  
 China, the world’s largest user of coal, increased imports
of the fuel by 17 percent from a year earlier to 11 million
metric tons, according to data released June 20 by the General
Administration of Customs.
