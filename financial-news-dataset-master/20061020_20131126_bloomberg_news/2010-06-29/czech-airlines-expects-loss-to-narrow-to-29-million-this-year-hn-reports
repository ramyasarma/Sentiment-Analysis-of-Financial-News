             Czech Airlines’ 2010 loss will
narrow to 600 million koruna ($29 million) from last year’s loss
of 3.8 billion koruna after the company restructured its
operations,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer  Miroslav Dvorak .  
 An independent audit concluded that the future of the
state-owned airline also known as CSA remains “uncertain,” the
newspaper said.
