             Singapore Airlines Ltd.  plans to
sell bonds for the first time in almost a decade, taking
advantage of low borrowing costs to tap a S$1 billion ($715
million) medium-term note program it set up in 2003.  
 The airline will issue S$500 million of 3.22 percent, 10-
year notes on or about July 9 to raise money for working capital
and expenditure, it said in a filing to the Singapore stock
exchange today.  
 “It’s appropriate to finance in a favorable interest rate
environment,” spokesman  Nicholas Ionides  said in a phone
interview from the city-state. The three-month  Singapore swap
offer rate , a gauge of banks’ lending costs, fell to 0.34647
percent today, the lowest in two months.  
 The airline industry will make a $2.5 billion profit in
2010 as Asian economies recover, reversing two years of losses,
the International Air Transport Association said this month.
Singapore Airlines is  55 percent -owned by Temasek Holdings Pte.,
Singapore’s state-owned investment company, and  posted  a six-
fold surge in net income to S$278 million for the quarter ended
March 31 as travel demand picked up.  
 Singapore Airlines last sold bonds in December 2001 when it
raised S$900 million from 4.15 percent notes maturing in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Spread Narrows  
 The extra yield investors demand to own the notes instead
of similar-maturity Singapore government debt fell 6 basis
points to 123 basis points today, the lowest since November 18,
2008, according Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. prices. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “From a financial point of view this airline is one of the
strongest in the world with net cash and very little debt,”
 Kelvin Lau , an analyst with Daiwa Institute of Research, said in
a phone interview from Hong Kong. “Their bonds are just like
government debt.”  
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., DBS Group
Holdings Ltd., Oversea-Chinese and United Overseas Bank Ltd.
will manage the sale, today’s statement shows.
