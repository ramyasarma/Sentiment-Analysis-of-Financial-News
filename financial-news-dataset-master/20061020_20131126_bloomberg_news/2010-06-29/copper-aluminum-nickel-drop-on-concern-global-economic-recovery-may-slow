             Copper, aluminum and zinc slumped as
Asian shares dropped to a two-week low on concerns that growth
in China, the engine of the world’s economic recovery, will slow,
hurting demand for commodities.  
 Three-month delivery copper dropped for the first time in
four days, falling as much as 3.1 percent to $6,659 a metric ton
on the London Metal Exchange, and traded at $6,672 at 2:52 p.m.
in Shanghai. Aluminum declined 1.7 percent to $1,994 a ton and
zinc lost 3.6 percent to $1,812.50 a ton.  
 China’s stocks  are poised for their longest losing streak
in two months after the Conference Board revised down its April
gauge for the outlook on China’s economy to indicate a slower
pace of expansion. China is the largest copper consumer.  
 “We are not optimistic about metals demand in China,”
Yuan Guangshan, an analyst at Zhongcai Futures Co., said from
Shanghai. An overhaul of financial institutions by the U.S. is
also “a blow to speculative investment,” Yuan said.  
 Group of 20 leaders have responded to the European debt
crisis with deficit-reduction targets and agreed to pursue
higher capital requirements for banks once economic recoveries
take hold. U.S. equities fell, treasuries rallied and  the dollar 
recouped losses as investors sought a refuge from risk aversion.  
 “Deficit cuts fueled expectations of a slowdown in the
global economy,” Lin Junhua, an analyst at Jinpeng Futures Co.,
said from Beijing today.  
 Below April Peak  
 Copper posted the biggest weekly gain in four months last
week as the dollar weakened, boosting demand for commodities.
The metal, used in wires and pipes, is still almost 17 percent
off an April peak.  
 Copper for September delivery in Shanghai dropped as much
as 2.2 percent to 52,760 yuan ($7,763) a ton and closed at
52,940 yuan. Zinc for October delivery in Shanghai tumbled as
much as 4.9 percent to 14,720 yuan a ton.  
 Lead for three-month delivery in London plunged 3.2 percent
to $1,800 a ton and tin was little changed at $18,240 a ton.  
 Recyclers of the metal in China, the world’s largest, have
idled about 8 percent of capacity because of high input costs,
according to a state-owned researcher. About 100,000 tons of the
country’s 1.2 million tons in annual capacity have been
suspended, said  Hu Yongda , analyst at Beijing Antaike
