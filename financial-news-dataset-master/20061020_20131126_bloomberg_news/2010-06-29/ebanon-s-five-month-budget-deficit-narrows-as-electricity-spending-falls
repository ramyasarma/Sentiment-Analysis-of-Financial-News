             Lebanon’s budget deficit narrowed
from a year earlier to 1.3 trillion Lebanese pounds ($868
million) in the first five months as the government spent less
on subsidizing its main electricity generating company.  
 The deficit shrank from 2.1 trillion pounds in the same
period last year, the  Ministry of Finance  said in an e-mailed
report today.  
 The government spent 541 billion pounds less on subsidies
for  Electricite du Liban , which provides more than 90 percent of
the country’s electricity, the ministry said.  
 Lebanon had a budget deficit of 4.46 trillion pounds last
year and 4.4 trillion pounds in 2008, averaging about 9.7
percent of gross domestic product.
