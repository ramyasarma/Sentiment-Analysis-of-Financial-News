             United Co. Rusal , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, said prices of the metal will recover
to $2,400 a metric ton by the end of the year.  
 Aluminum demand remains healthy even with the debt crisis
in Europe, Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska  told reporters
in Tokyo today. The company won’t change its production plan of
4.1 million tons this year, he said. Rusal has the capacity to
produce 4.6 million tons of aluminum annually.  
 Aluminum prices in London have declined 10 percent this
year on concern the European debt crisis and China’s measures to
curb its property market will hurt demand and derail the global
economic recovery. Prices in China, the largest consumer of the
metal, have dropped below the cost of production, Aluminum Corp.
of China Ltd. said June 8.  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange dropped 2 percent to $1,988.25 a ton at 5:36 p.m. Tokyo
time. Prices closed at $1,867.50 a ton on June 7, the lowest
level in eight months. The price reached an 18-month high on
April 16. Rusal said in April it expects aluminum to average
more than $2,000 a ton during 2010.
