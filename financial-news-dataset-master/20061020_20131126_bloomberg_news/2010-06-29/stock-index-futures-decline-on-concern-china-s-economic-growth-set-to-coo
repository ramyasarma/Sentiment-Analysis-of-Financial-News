             U.S. stocks plummeted, sending the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  to its lowest level since Oct. 30,
on concern over weakening growth in China and a slump in
American consumer confidence.  
 Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc. and Alcoa Inc. fell more than
5.5 percent after the Conference Board cut its estimate for
Chinese economic growth. JPMorgan Chase & Co. slipped 3.8
percent after Moody’s Investors Service said the bank may face
lost revenue from a cap on debit fees. Zimmer Holdings Inc.
gained 0.1 percent for the only rise in the S&P 500.  
 The  S&P 500  sank 3.1 percent to 1,041.24 as of 4 p.m. in
New York, after falling as low as 1,035.18. The last time only
one S&P 500 company rose was in September 2008. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  dropped 268.22 points, or 2.7 percent, to
9,870.30.  
 “China set the tone in the morning and then it accelerated,
with investors probably exiting the market ahead of the U.S.
unemployment data on Friday,” said  Peter Jankovskis , who helps
manage about $2.2 billion as co-chief investment officer at
Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. “The market volatility
is growing, which reflects the overhang from the situation in
Europe and the slowdown in China.”  
 Among 24 industry groups in the S&P 500, none had a loss
smaller than 0.9 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Global Growth Prospects  
 The S&P 500 has  tumbled  14 percent from this year’s high on
April 23 on concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and
China’s moves to slow the world’s largest emerging economy will
dent global growth. The Conference Board today revised its April
leading economic index for China to a 0.3 percent rise, from a
gain of 1.7 percent reported June 15.  
 Benchmark indexes extended early losses after the
Conference Board’s gauge of confidence among consumers slumped
to 52.9 this month from a revised 62.7 in May as Americans
became pessimistic about the outlook for the labor market and
the economy. The median forecast called for a decline to 62.5,
and the gauge was lower than all projections in a Bloomberg News
survey of 71 economists.  
 Banks were the biggest drag on the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index 
as the rate lenders say they charge each other for three-month
loans in euros in London rose to 0.688 percent, the highest in
eight months, as institutions hoarded cash before a 12-month
European Central Bank loan expires later this week.  
 Boeing, Caterpillar  
 Boeing  led declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
slumping 6.3 percent to $63.04. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., a
mining company, dropped 11 percent to $48.49.  
 Caterpillar  declined 5.5 percent to $60.85. The world’s
largest maker of construction equipment said yesterday it is
buying out a partner in a Chinese joint venture as part of plans
to expand excavator production in the country.  
 Alcoa  slid 6.3 percent to $10.34 on concern demand from
China may weaken. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., the
world’s biggest publicly traded copper producer, dropped 5.6
percent to $61.07.  
 China’s exports face “strong headwinds” in the second half
of the year from policy tightening measures and the European
debt crisis, reducing prospects of a rebound in the stock
market, Citigroup Inc. said in a report obtained yesterday.  
 “China growth is ebbing,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment
officer at Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, which oversees $55
billion. “If that’s the engine the world is looking at to pull
us out of the doldrums then there’s been a disappointing number
and disappointment there.”  
 Shanghai Composite  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  retreated 4.3 percent to
2,427.05 today, the biggest drop since May 17 and the lowest
close in 14 months.  
 JPMorgan, the bank headed by Jamie Dimon, slid 3.8 percent
to $37.05. The second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, along with
Bank of America Corp. and  Wells Fargo & Co. , may lose $1.38
billion in annual revenue from the proposed cap on credit-card
swipe fees being considered by the U.S. Congress, Moody’s said
in a report. Bank of America fell 4.4 percent to $14.57. Wells
Fargo slumped 4.1 percent to $25.93.  
 Zimmer rose 0.1 percent to $54.60 for the only gain in the
S&P 500. Since 1996, there have been three times that only one
S&P 500 stock advanced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The last was on Sept. 29, 2008.  
 The benchmark index for U.S. stock options jumped the most
in three weeks. The  VIX , as the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index is known, increased 18 percent to 34.13. The
index, which measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the S&P 500, is down from this year’s
closing high of 45.79 on May 20 and above its 20 average over
its two-decade history.  
 Technical Levels  
 The S&P 500 was testing  levels  watched by analysts who
study charts and patterns.  
 “The S&P can break below 1,040 and go on to test the 1,000
zone,” said  Dan Wantrobski , Philadelphia-based director of
technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. “That would
be a 38.2 percent retracement of the cyclical bull run off the
March 2009 bottom to the recent April 2010 highs.”  
 Technical analysts who use the Fibonacci ratios described
by Leonardo of Pisa in “Liber Abaci” in 1202 believe the price
of an asset may reverse an earlier gain or decline after
reaching certain levels. Among those thresholds are the midpoint
between an asset’s high and low points as well as levels marking
the recovery of 61.8 percent, 38.2 percent and 23.6 percent of
reversals of the previous trend.  
 Micron Declines  
 Micron Technology Inc.  sank 13 percent to $8.67. The
company “reported modestly better-than-expected fiscal third-
quarter results,” wrote UBS AG analysts in a report. “Despite
this, we believe stable to declining price trends over the past
month could be a precursor to further declines.”  
 Chipmakers and semiconductor-related shares in the S&P 500
slid 3.1 percent as a group.  SanDisk Corp.  fell 7 percent to
$42.64. Teradyne Inc. slumped 7.7 percent to $9.95. Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. retreated 7.1 percent to $7.48.  
 Casino companies slid after KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
said the stocks’ valuation is “rich” given sluggish growth in
the U.S. and the potential for government intervention in Macau.  
 Wynn Resorts Ltd.  dropped 7.7 percent to $78.55. Las Vegas
Sands Corp. sank 9.9 percent to $22.84. MGM Resorts
International slipped 8.6 percent to $10.05.  
 Stocks retreated even after home prices in 20 U.S. cities
rose in April from a year earlier as sales got a boost from a
tax credit aimed at reviving the industry that triggered the
worst recession since the 1930s. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of
property values climbed 3.8 percent from April 2009, the biggest
year-over-year gain since September 2006. The increase exceeded
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
