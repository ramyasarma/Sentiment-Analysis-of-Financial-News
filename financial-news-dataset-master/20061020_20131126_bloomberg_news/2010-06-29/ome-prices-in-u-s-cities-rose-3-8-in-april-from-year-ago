             Home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose
in April from a year earlier as sales got a boost from a tax
credit aimed at reviving the industry that triggered the worst
recession since the 1930s.  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values climbed 3.8
percent from April 2009, the biggest year-over-year gain since
September 2006, the group said today in New York. The increase
exceeded the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  
 The end of a government homebuyer incentive worth as much
as $8,000, mounting foreclosures and unemployment near a 26-year
high threaten to set real estate prices back following the
stabilization that began earlier this year. Eroding home equity
may limit household spending, the biggest part of the economy,
even as gains in income help underpin demand.  
 “It’s just a transitory bounce reflecting the flurry of
activity before the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit,”
said  John Herrmann , senior fixed-income strategist at State
Street Global Markets LLC in Boston. “As the tax credit is
unwound and sales are plunging, the pricing environment is once
again weakening.”  
 Consumer confidence in June sank more than forecast as
Americans grew concerned over the outlook for jobs and incomes,
another report today showed. The New York-based Conference
Board, a private research group, said its sentiment  index 
dropped to 52.9 this month from 62.7 in May.  
 Shares Drop  
 Stocks fell on growing concern over the outlook for global
growth. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 2.4 percent to
1,049.24 at 10:01 a.m. in New York. Treasury securities rose,
sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.96
percent from 3.02 percent late yesterday.  
 The home-price index was forecast to rise 3.4 percent after
a year-over-year increase of 2.3 percent for March, according to
the  median  forecast of 26 economists surveyed. Estimates ranged
from 1.3 percent to 4.1 percent. Year-over-year records began in
2001.  
 The gauge climbed 0.4 percent in April from the prior month
after adjusting for seasonal variations following a March
decrease of 0.2 percent. Unadjusted prices increased 0.8 percent
from the prior month.  
 The year-over-year gauge provides better indications of
trends in prices, the group has said. The panel includes  Karl Case  and  Robert Shiller , the economists who created the index.  
 Breakdown by City  
 Eleven of the 20 cities in the S&P/Case-Shiller index
showed a year-over-year increase, led by an 18 percent gain in
San Francisco. Las Vegas showed the biggest year-over-year
decrease, with prices falling 8.5 percent.  
 Compared with the prior month, 18 of the 20 areas covered
showed an increase on an unadjusted basis, led by a 2.4 percent
gain in Washington and a 2.2 percent increase in San Francisco.
Miami and New York were the only two cities showing a monthly
decrease.  
 “Inventory data and foreclosure activity have not shown
any signs of improvement,”  David Blitzer , chairman of the index
committee at S&P, said in a statement. “Consistent and
sustained boosts to economic growth from housing may have to
wait to next year.”  
 Builders from  KB Home  to Lennar Corp. and  Toll Brothers
Inc.  are reporting falling sales after the extended tax credit
for homebuyers expired. To qualify, buyers had to sign contracts
by April 30 and must close transactions by June 30.  
 Builder Loss  
 Los Angeles-based KB Home, which targets first-time buyers,
reported a wider-than-estimated loss for the quarter ended May
31 as new orders declined 23 percent and the average price for
its houses fell 4 percent from a year ago.  
 “Homebuyers who missed the deadline seemed to step out of
the market completely,” KB Home Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Mezger  said in a June 25 conference call with analysts. It’s too
early in the third quarter to forecast demand, he said.  
 “It’s a matter of when, not if, things are going to
improve,” Mezger said.  
 The S&P Supercomposite Homebuilder  Index , which includes
Toll and Lennar, has dropped 28 percent since reaching a 19-
month high on May 3. The broader S&P 500 Index is down 12
percent from April 23’s 19-month peak.  
 There is little consensus on the outlook for property
values. About half of 106 U.S. forecasters in a study published
June 23 by MacroMarkets LLC expect price declines in 2010 and
half anticipate either little-change or increasing values.  
 Purchases  of new homes plunged by a record in May from the
prior month, and the median price declined from a year earlier
to the lowest level since December 2003, Commerce Department
data showed. The National Association of Realtors reported a
drop in May sales of  existing  houses.  
 Foreclosures may be an obstacle for the market for much of
the year. More than a fifth of U.S. mortgage holders owed more
than their homes were worth in the first quarter, Seattle-based
Zillow.com said last month.
