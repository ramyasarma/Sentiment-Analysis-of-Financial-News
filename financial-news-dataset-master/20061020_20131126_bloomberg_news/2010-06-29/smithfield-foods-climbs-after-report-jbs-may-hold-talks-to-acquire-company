             Smithfield Foods Inc. , the world’s
largest pork processor, rose the most in seven months after
Valor Economico reported Brazil’s  JBS SA  may hold talks to
acquire the company.  
 Smithfield  rose  80 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $15.68 at
10:54 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares earlier gained as much as 8.9 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Nov. 11.  
 The newspaper didn’t say where it got the information.
Smithfield’s policy is not to comment on “marketplace rumors,”
 Keira Ullrich , a spokeswoman at the Smithfield, Virginia-based
company, said today in an e-mail. JBS also declined comment,
Jerry O’Callaghan, the investor relations director, said in a
telephone interview.  
 JBS, the world’s biggest beef producer, bought Smithfield’s
Beef operations in 2008 for $565 million and paid $800 million
for control of U.S. chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. in
2009. Acquiring Smithfield would “substantially” expand Sao
Paulo-based JBS’s operations in Europe and the U.S.,  Farha Aslam , an analyst at Stephens Inc. in New York, wrote in a
report.  
 The deal “would align with JBS’s strategy of global
footprint expansion,” Aslam said.  
 JBS fell 4.8 percent to 7.62 reais at 11:03 a.m. New York
time in Sao Paulo trading.
