             A fund supported by Germany’s KfW
development bank that aims to invest in energy efficient
projects in developing nations will likely have financing
sources worth $500 million by the end of the year.  
 The fund, which has commitments worth about $100 million
now, is meant to reduce the risk for private investors and
leverage private capital, German environment minister  Norbert Roettgen  said today in Berlin.  
 A combination of private and public money will be necessary
to boost investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency in
developing nations because the risks for investors are too high,
Roettgen said. The KfW fund has three tranches of financing,
with the first two made up of public sources from the
environment ministry as well as European Union development funds
and other national development banks.  
 “With very little public capital, it’s possible to
leverage an enormous amount of private capital for these
projects,” said  Caio Koch-Weser , Deutsche Bank AG’s vice
chairman and former German deputy finance minister.  
 Developing countries require $100 billion annually by 2020
to help them grow their economies without relying on polluting
fossil fuels like coal and oil, Koch-Weser said. The proposed
money is part of on-going United Nations-sponsored climate
change talks are attempting to limit output of greenhouse gases.  
 Insurance companies and pension funds offer an “enormous
potential” for climate-related investment, said Koch-Weser.
Such funds are potentially worth “trillions” if mobilized, he
added.
