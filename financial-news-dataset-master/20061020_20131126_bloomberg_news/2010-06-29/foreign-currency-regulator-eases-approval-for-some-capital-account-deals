             China’s foreign-currency regulator
said it is simplifying approval procedures for some transactions
under the capital account by delving more power to its local
branches.  
 The transactions covered by the new rules include domestic
companies’ lending to branches overseas, short-term foreign debt
quotas and remittance of overseas funds, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said on its website today.
The changes will be effective July 1, according to the
statement.
