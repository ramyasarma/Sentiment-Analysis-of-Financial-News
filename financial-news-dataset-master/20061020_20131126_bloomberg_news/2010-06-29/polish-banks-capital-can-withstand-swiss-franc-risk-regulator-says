             Polish banks have enough capital to
face the risks that arise from the Swiss franc’s recent gains
against the zloty, Andrzej Stopczynski, head of the country’s
banking regulator, said in an e-mail today.  
 The zloty has lost 12 percent to the Swiss currency this
year and traded at 3.1412 per franc, the lowest in 15 months, at
1:54 p.m.  
 “For banks this means rising credit risks and higher
capital requirements, though it must be stressed that the
industry’s capital adequacy is sufficient,” Stopczynski said in
an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. “The
current situation proves that non-zloty home loans shouldn’t be
a mass-market product.”  
 Households and companies in Poland, the only European Union
economy to avoid a recession last year, increased their reliance
on foreign-currency loans in the past two years. Swiss-franc-
denominated loans accounted for 59 percent of all mortgages at
the end of March.
