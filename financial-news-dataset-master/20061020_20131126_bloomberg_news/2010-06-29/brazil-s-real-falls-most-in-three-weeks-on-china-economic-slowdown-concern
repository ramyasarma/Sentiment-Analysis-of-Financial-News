             Brazil’s real fell the most in three
weeks after an economic index for China showed the smallest gain
in five months in April, boosting concern demand for the South
American nation’s exports will slow.  
 The real declined 0.9 percent to 1.7965 per dollar at 8:40
a.m. New York time, from 1.7803 yesterday. The currency earlier
dropped as much as 1.1 percent, the most on an intraday basis
since June 4.  
 The Conference Board’s leading economic index for China
rose 0.3 percent, less than the 1.7 percent reported June 15.  
 “Much of the confidence driving the Brazil story is
commodity linked, and the major buyer of these commodities is
China,” said  Mike Moran , a senior currency strategist at
Standard Chartered Plc in New York. “Any sign they are easing
back on their consumption will have a direct impact on Brazil,
not only on the currency, but also on trade and corporate
profitability.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January was unchanged at 11.32 percent.
