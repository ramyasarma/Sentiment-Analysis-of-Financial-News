             Tesla Motors Inc., the electric-car
company that hasn’t posted a profit, surged 41 percent to $23.89
after completing the first initial public offering of a U.S.
automaker in a half century.  
 The gain was the biggest for a U.S. IPO since Financial
Engines Inc. rallied 44 percent in March. Tesla advanced even as
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 3.1 percent.
