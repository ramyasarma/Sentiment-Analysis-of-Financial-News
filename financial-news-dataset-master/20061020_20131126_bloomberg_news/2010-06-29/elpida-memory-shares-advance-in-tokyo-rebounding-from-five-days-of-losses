             Elpida Memory Inc. , Japan’s biggest
computer memory-chip maker, rose the most in more than five
months in Tokyo, rebounding from a 23 percent decline over the
five trading since June 21.  
 Elpida  climbed as much as 8.6 percent, its biggest gain
since Jan. 5, and was 7 percent higher at 1,400 yen as of the 11
a.m. trading break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Renesas
Electronics Corp. , a Japanese chipmaker comprised of two money-
losing rivals, added 7.6 percent, after closing lower for five
consecutive days.  
 “The shares are in demand as the market swings back to a
positive take on Elpida,” said  Yuichi Ishida , an analyst at
Mizuho Investors Securities Co. in Tokyo. Ishida, who recommends
buying the company’s shares, also cited the outlook for an
increase in earnings and computer demand ahead of the back-to-
school season in the U.S.  
 Elpida expects record profit and revenue this fiscal year
as computer sales rebound and new mobile devices require more
memory to process programs, President  Yukio Sakamoto  said
earlier this month.  
 Elpida will post operating profit of more than 160 billion
yen ($1.8 billion) on sales of about 700 billion yen in the year
ending March 2011, assuming chip prices remain at current levels,
Sakamoto said earlier this month. The price of the  benchmark  1-
gigabit dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chip fell 15
percent this year, after more than tripling in 2009, according
to prices at Taipei-based DrameXchange Technology Inc.
