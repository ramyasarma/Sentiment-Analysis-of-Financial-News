                  June 28 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- Xtreme Power, a
Texas-based developer of power-storage systems, has raised about
$18 million from nine unnamed investors as part of plans to
raise $28.7 million.  
 The sale included equity, options, and warrants and adds to
at least $19.5 million in debt and equity raised previously,
Xtreme said in a  document  filed with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission on June 28.  
 Xtreme manufactures power storage systems with as much as
100 megawatts of capacity that can cope with problems created by
intermittent wind and solar power generation and help integrate
with smart grid systems, according to the company’s website.  
 The filing listed executives and outside directors from
Sail Venture Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners, as well as
former U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Pat
Wood III, who currently serves on Xtreme Power’s board. Xtreme
CEO  Carlos J. Coe  could not immediately be reached for comment.
