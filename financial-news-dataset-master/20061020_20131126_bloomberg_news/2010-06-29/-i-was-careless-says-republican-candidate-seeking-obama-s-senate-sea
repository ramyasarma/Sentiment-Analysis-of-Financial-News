             Mark Kirk , the Illinois Republican
seeking a Senate seat once held by President  Barack Obama ,
apologized and sought to move his campaign beyond reports that
he has repeatedly made exaggerations and misstatements about his
biography.  
 “I have made mistakes concerning certain aspects of my
accomplishments and experiences,” Kirk, a five-term congressman
and Navy reservist from Chicago’s northern suburbs, said during
his first news conference since the reports started surfacing a
month ago. “I pledge to correct those errors. I am not perfect,
and I was careless.”  
 Kirk’s political problems started when he was  caught  by the
Washington Post claiming that a 1999 military  award  had been
given to him individually, when it had actually been awarded to
an ad-hoc intelligence team he created and ran.  
 He also has been caught by various news organizations --
with the assistance of his opponent’s campaign -- incorrectly
suggesting that he came under fire while flying intelligence
missions over Iraq and overstating his experience as a teacher.  
 The race between Kirk, 50, and Democrat  Alexi Giannoulias ,
34, is among the most closely watched this election year. The
seat is held by Senator  Roland Burris , a Democrat who was
appointed to finish the term Obama won in 2004. Burris isn’t
seeking a full term.
