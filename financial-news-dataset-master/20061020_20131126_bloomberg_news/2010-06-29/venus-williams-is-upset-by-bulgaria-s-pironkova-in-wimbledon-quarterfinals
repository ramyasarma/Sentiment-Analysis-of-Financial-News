             Five-time champion Venus Williams
was upset by Bulgaria’s Tsvetana Pironkova, who had never been
past the second round at a Grand Slam, in the quarterfinals at
Wimbledon today.  
 Pironkova, ranked No. 82 by the WTA Tour, beat the American
No. 2 seed and last year’s runnerup, 6-2, 6-3 on Court 1. The
Bulgarian is aiming for a first career title.
