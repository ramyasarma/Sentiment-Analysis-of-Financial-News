             The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ’s
largest drop in three weeks pushed the gauge to its lowest
intraday level of the year, heightening the risk of bigger
losses, according to analysts who watch chart patterns.  
 The  S&P 500  fell as much as 3.7 percent to 1,035.18 today
after U.S. consumer confidence trailed the median economist
estimate and concern grew that Chinese growth is slowing. That
drove the index below 1,040.78, which had been its weakest level
of the year on May 25, and its February low of 1,044.50.  
 Repeated swings in indexes toward levels that traders refer
to as support usually end with the prices failing to hold,
according to  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset
Management, which oversees more than $800 million from New York.
Technical patterns may thwart bulls counting on the fastest two-
year profit growth since 1995 and the biggest expansion in gross
domestic product in six years to lift equities, he said.  
 “Sentiment is deteriorating pretty rapidly,” Shaoul said.
“That’s the third test of 1,040 for the S&P 500. If you take
out that level, it could lead to a new wave of selling, with 980
as a support level. It’s not much fun getting there.”  
 The  S&P 500  last closed below 980 on Aug. 17. It fell to an
intraday level of 1,042.17 on June 8 before rebounding to close
at 1,062. The index lost 3.1 percent at 1,041.24 as of 4 p.m. in
New York.  
 12-Year Low  
 The benchmark index for U.S. stocks has risen 54 percent
since closing at a 12-year low of 676.53 on March 9, 2009.
Earnings for S&P 500 companies may rise 31 percent in 2010 and
17 percent in 2011, the largest two-year advance since the
period ended in 1995, according to the average analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg survey. Economists predict a 3.2 percent
expansion in U.S. GDP this year, the biggest since 2004,
according to the median projection.  
 “The 1,040 level on the S&P 500 is critical either if we
can hold beneath it or pop back above it,” said  Ryan Detrick ,
chief technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in
Cincinnati. “That has been a support for the whole year.
Keeping it simple, if we make new lows for the year, that’s not
a good sign. On the other hand, it’s encouraging to stay above
it as you can get one of those explosive oversold rallies.”  
 The S&P 500 has  tumbled  14 percent from this year’s high on
April 23 amid concern less spending by indebted European nations
and China’s attempt to slow the world’s largest emerging economy
will damp global growth. The decline drove the S&P 500’s  price-
to-earnings ratio to  15.1 earlier this month, the cheapest
valuation since June 2009.  
 ‘Oversold Rally’  
 “Do not be surprised by an oversold rally,” said  Dan Wantrobski , Philadelphia-based director of technical research at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. “Stocks are pushing deeper into
oversold territory on a short-term basis and sentiment is
becoming much more bearish.”  
 The S&P 500’s  decline  in the past two weeks started after
the index failed to stay above a level identified by chart
analysts as bullish: its average price in the past 200 days. The
index closed above the 200-day mean on June 15, then advanced
less than 0.3 percent in the next three days.  
 In the seven trading  sessions  since then, six have produced
losses and the index is down 6.8 percent. The retreat came as
the S&P 500 failed to close above a level representing the
midpoint between its record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007,
and its weakest level of March 2009.  
 “We were able to hold above it for several days and then
failed,” said  Katie Stockton , chief market technician at MKM
Holdings LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, referring to the 200-day
moving average. “The breakdown back below it certainly
exacerbated the pull back. You were already short-term
overbought and I think that was more of the issue. Mid-June we
became overbought and that’s when we went back below the 200-
day.”
