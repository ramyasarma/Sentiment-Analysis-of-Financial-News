             Medtronic Inc. , the world’s largest
medical device maker, said it received a warning letter from
U.S. regulators about reporting requirements and handling of
complaints at its Louisville, Colorado, plant.  
 The warning letter followed a Food and Drug Administration
inspection of Medtronic’s Surgical Technologies plant in
Colorado in January and February, Medtronic spokesman  Brian Henry  said today in an e-mail. The FDA cited “internal
procedures for design controls, complaint handling and medical
device reporting,” among other issues, Henry said.  
 Minneapolis-based Medtronic has responded in writing to the
FDA’s letter, Henry said. The Surgical Technologies unit makes
hardware and software for use during surgical procedures,
according to Medtronic’s website. The warning letter is not
publicly available, Erica Jefferson, an FDA spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail.  
 “We are working diligently to respond to the FDA on all
issues and to ensure any additional actions necessary to resolve
the concerns are in place as quickly as possible,” Henry said
in the e-mail.  
 Medtronic disclosed the FDA action in a regulatory filing.  
 The company’s shares declined 66 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
$36.21 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
Medtronic has dropped 18 percent this year.
