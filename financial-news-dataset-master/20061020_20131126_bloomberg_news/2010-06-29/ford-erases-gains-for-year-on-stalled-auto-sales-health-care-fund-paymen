             Ford Motor Co. , which more than
quadrupled last year, erased its 2010 gains amid concerns about
sluggish auto sales and the possibility the company will issue
shares to help make an $859 million health-care fund payment.  
 Ford  fell  55 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $9.88 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares earlier
fell to $9.75, the lowest intraday price since December, and are
down 1.2 percent this year.  
 Ford’s fall today was larger than the 2.7 percent decline
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the 3.1 percent decline
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  
 Ford Americas President  Mark Fields  said last week that the
U.S. auto market has “flat-lined” since the third quarter of
last year. Ford may use stock to pay as much as $610 million by
tomorrow to the  United Auto Workers  Retiree Medical Benefits
Trust to cover health care for former hourly employees. Analysts
said investors may see a payment in stock as a potential sign of
weakness in the shares.  
 Ford, the only major U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy,
reversed three years of losses by posting $2.7 billion in net
income last year. U.S. sales are up 30 percent this year at the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker, on gains from new models
such as the Fusion hybrid and the redesigned Taurus sedan. Ford
Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  has said the automaker will
be “solidly profitable” this year.
