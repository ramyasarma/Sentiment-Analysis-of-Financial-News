             Google Inc.  said it will change the
way people in China access its search engine after the
government said the company could no longer automatically
redirect users to the unfiltered Hong Kong site.  
 “It’s clear from conversations we have had with Chinese
government officials that they find the redirect unacceptable,”
Google said in a blog posting today. “Without an ICP license,
we can’t operate a commercial website like Google.cn--so Google
would effectively go dark in China.”  
 Google instead created a “landing site” that offers
Chinese users the option of going to the Hong Kong site, in
addition to a few services such as translation, that are
provided in China, according to the blog. The company
resubmitted an application to the Chinese government for the
Internet Content Provider license based on this approach, it
said.  
 The U.S. company in March closed its China search engine
and began automatically directing users to the Hong Kong site
after saying it would no longer self-censor search results.  
 The new approach allows Google to “stay true” to a
commitment not to self-censor search results in China while
adhering to local law, according to the statement.  
 The shift led to a loss of market share in China for the
Mountain View, California-based company, according to data from
research firm Analysys International. Local rival  Baidu Inc. 
increased its market share after Google’s policy change,
Analysys said.
