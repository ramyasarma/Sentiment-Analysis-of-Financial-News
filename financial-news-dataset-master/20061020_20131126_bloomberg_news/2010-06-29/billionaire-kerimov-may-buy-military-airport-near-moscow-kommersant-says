             Russian billionaire Suleiman Kerimov
may acquire part of a military airport near Moscow and convert 
it into a private airfield for business jets, Kommersant 
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  
 The Defense Ministry plans to auction off 46 hectares of 
the air force’s Kubinka base for at least 212 million rubles 
($6.8 million), the newspaper said.   
 Kubinka is closer to some of the region’s most elite 
residential communities than Moscow’s three major airports, 
Kommersant.
