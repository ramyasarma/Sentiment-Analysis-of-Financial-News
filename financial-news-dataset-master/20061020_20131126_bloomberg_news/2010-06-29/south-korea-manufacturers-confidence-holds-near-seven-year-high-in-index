             South Korean manufacturers’
confidence held near a seven-year high as companies shrugged off
concern that the global rebound may falter.  
 An  index  measuring expectations for July stayed at 104,
unchanged from June, the Bank of Korea said today. The reading
hit 107 in May, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2002,
when the bank published its confidence survey on a quarterly
basis. A measure of non-manufacturing companies’ expectations
fell to 87 from 90.  
 “Firms continue to be optimistic about their business
environments,” said Son Won, an economist at the Bank of Korea.
“They don’t see much impact on sales and earnings from Europe’s
debt problems or geopolitical tension with North Korea.”  
 The government last week raised its 2010 economic growth
forecast to 5.8 percent, from a December projection of 5 percent,
saying a faster-than-expected global recovery is spurring
exports and local demand. South Korea may join India, Malaysia
and Taiwan in the region in increasing borrowing costs as the
economy shows resilience to Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  
 Today’s report showed an index measuring the outlook for
exports declined to 114 from 118 a month ago, and a gauge for
the domestic sales outlook for July also fell to 114 from 117.  
 The survey, conducted between June 17 and June 24, is based
on responses from 1,594 manufacturers and 841 non-manufacturers.  
 South Korea’s economy expanded 2.1 percent last quarter
from the previous three months, a June 4 report showed, compared
with an April estimate of 1.8 percent.  
 Total exports on a customs-cleared basis, which excludes
ships, surged 40.5 percent in May from a year earlier, as the
global economic recovery boosted demand for Korean-made products
like  Samsung Electronics Co. ’s semiconductors and  Hyundai Motor
Co. ’s cars, the central bank said this week.
