             Asian  stocks  dropped to a two-week
low as concerns over Chinese economic growth overshadowed stock
buybacks in Japan and Taiwan. The yen traded near a five-week
high against the dollar as signs a slowing global recovery
boosted demand for Japan’s safe-haven status.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  lost 0.7 percent to 114.86 as
of 1:22 p.m. in Tokyo, taking its slump from its April 15 high
to 11 percent.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  futures dropped 0.3
percent. The yen strengthened to 88.90 per dollar in Tokyo from
89.37 yesterday in New York when it touched 89.07, the highest
level since May 21. Copper sank 1.6 percent in London.  
 Investor sentiment worsened today after the Conference
Board said its China leading economic index rose 0.3 percent in
April, less than the 1.7 percent gain reported June 15. China’s
exports face “strong headwinds” in the second half of the year
from policy tightening measures and the European debt crisis,
Citigroup Inc. said in a report today.  
 “The market is pausing to digest the implications of the
macro overhang of the last couple of weeks,” said  Jason Teh ,
who helps manage $3 billion at Investors Mutual in Sydney.
“Markets are maybe realizing the growth trajectory may be
slower because there is still too much leverage in the system.
Today there is more of a focus on stocks specific news.”  
 China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  slumped 1.8 percent and
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.1 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi dropped 0.5 percent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
lost 0.2 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  sank 0.7
percent.  
 China Stocks  
 Industrial Bank Co.  and  China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. 
declined more than 1.6 percent, while developer Gemdale Corp.
retreated 5.7 percent after a senior executive resigned.  
 “There’s no catalyst for stocks to go up,” said  Wei Wei ,
an analyst at West China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “I don’t
see the possibility of a reversal until the government eases its
current tightening measures.”  
 The New York-based Conference Board cited a “calculation
error” as the reason for the revision in its Chinese leading
indicator index. The research group’s outlook for the Chinese
economy hasn’t been affected by the correction to the index,
said William Adams, the group’s resident economist.  
 “Growth was not likely to accelerate in China, and in fact,
a moderation is possible,” Adams said in a telephone interview.
“This correction also supports the same view.”  
 Demand for safe-haven assets lifted the yen and dragged 10-
year Treasury yields to levels not seen in 14 months. Japan’s
currency rose to as much as 109.17 per euro, the most since June
10. The euro was as low as $1.2262 from $1.2277.  
 Policymakers Balance  
 “As economic data worsens I’m not sure if policymakers
will be able to strike a balance between economic growth and
austerity,” said  Kazuyuki Kato , treasury department manager in
Tokyo at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s second-
largest publicly traded lender by assets. “The bias is for the
yen to advance.”  
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell two basis points
to 3.01 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
level was last seen in April 2009. Two-year notes yielded 0.62
percent, near the record low of 0.6044 percent set Dec. 17, 2008,
which came after the Federal Reserve cut its  target  for
overnight lending to a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  
 Japan’s industrial production fell in May while its  jobless
rate  rose, government data showed today. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey predict the Conference Board will report later
today that its index of U.S. consumer confidence fell to 62.5
this month from 63.3 in May.  
 New Zealand Dollar  
 New Zealand’s dollar slipped 0.6 percent to 70.42 U.S.
cents, and dropped 1 percent to 62.70 yen after a government
report showed home-building  approvals  declined in May.  
 Permits declined 9.6 percent from April when they gained a
revised 8.4 percent, Statistics New Zealand said, citing
seasonally adjusted figures.  
 Copper declined in London as deficit-reduction and
financial-overhaul plans discussed at the Group of 20 meeting
fueled concerns the global economy recovery may slow.  
 Three-month delivery copper fell as much as 1.6 percent to
$6,758 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at
$6,772. Nickel tumbled as much as 1.9 percent to $20,250 a ton
and lead fell as much as 1.7 percent to $1,829.25 a ton.
