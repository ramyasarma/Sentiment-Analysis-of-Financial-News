             Colombia’s peso fell to a two-week
low on concern economic growth in China is slowing and as a
gauge of U.S. consumer confidence dropped, signaling reduced
demand for the South American country’s exports.  
 The peso slipped 0.8 percent to 1,920.35 per U.S. dollar at
2:59 p.m. New York time, from 1,906 yesterday. That’s the
weakest level since June 14.  
 The Conference Board, a New York-based research group,
revised its leading economic index for China to 0.3 percent,
less than the 1.7 percent gain it reported June 15. The
Conference Board also showed today confidence among U.S.
consumers declined in June as Americans became pessimistic about
the outlook for the labor market and the economy.  
 “There’s a lot of nervousness in international markets,”
said  Felipe Campos , head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Alianza Valores. “Slower growth translates into less demand for
exports from emerging markets.”  
 In the first four months of the year, Colombia sent 44
percent of its exports to the U.S. and 7.8 percent to China.
China has become the country’s second-biggest trading partner
following Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s pledge last year to
halt imports from Colombia over its decision to allow the U.S.
greater access to some of its military bases. In the first four
months, exports to Venezuela plunged 72 percent from a year ago.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.84
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.313 centavos to 121.429 centavos per peso.
