             Investors should bet on the euro
slipping against several currencies rather than on just a
decline versus the dollar, according to Standard Bank Plc  
 “It is very possible for the euro’s trade-weighted index
and euro/dollar to diverge,” Steve Barrow, head of Group-of-10
foreign-exchange research in London, wrote in a report today.
“Just recently we have started to see such divergence and we
feel that this might be a sign that the euro is best sold
against a range of currencies, rather than just the dollar.”  
 The euro slipped 0.4 percent against the dollar in the past
month while it has declined 2.4 percent versus its key global
peers, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indices.
