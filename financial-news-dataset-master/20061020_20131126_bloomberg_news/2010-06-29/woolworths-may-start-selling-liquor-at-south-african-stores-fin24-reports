             Woolworths Holdings Ltd. may start 
selling liquor in or next to its existing stores in South 
Africa, Fin24 reported, citing Zyda Rylands, the managing 
director of the company’s food division.  
 The company is piloting the project at stores in 
Johannesburg and Cape Town, the Johannesburg-based news service
said. The venture comes after Woolworths discontinued a 
pharmacy venture it tried with Netcare Ltd., Fin24 said.
