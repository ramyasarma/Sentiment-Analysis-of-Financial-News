             PetroChina Co. , China’s second-
largest oil refiner, will start production at an expanded
Ningxia refinery at the end of 2011, a year later than initially
planned, parent China National Petroleum Corp. said today.  
 The deadline was extended after the refinery underwent
restructuring that delayed plans first announced in 2008, Ma Li,
a spokeswoman from the Ningxia unit, said by telephone from the
northwestern province. The 5 million metric ton-a-year refinery
can produce 1.67 million tons of gasoline and 2.29 million tons
of diesel a year, CNPC  said  in its online newsletter today.  
 China’s refiners are increasing processing capacity to meet
demand in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The delay
may alleviate an oversupply of oil products this year forecast
by CNPC in its company’s annual research report on Feb. 4.  
 The Ningxia expansion will include a 5 million-ton crude
distillation unit, a 2.6 million-ton catalytic cracking unit and
a 600,000-ton reforming unit, CNPC said today. The units are
among 10 facilities to be built, it said. PetroChina will shut
the existing 1.5 million-ton plant once the new refinery starts.  
 The expansion costs 7 billion yuan ($1 billion) and the
upgraded refinery will produce fuels that meet China IV
standards, which require lower emissions, according to the
statement. China IV standards are similar to the Euro IV grade
adopted in the European Union.
