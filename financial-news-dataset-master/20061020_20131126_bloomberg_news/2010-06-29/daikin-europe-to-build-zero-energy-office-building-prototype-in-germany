                  June 29 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- Daikin Europe, a
unit of Japanese air conditioner maker  Daikin Industries Ltd. ,
will build a “zero-energy” office building as part of a
project to test low-carbon, energy-efficient technology.  
 The building uses heat pumps, solar cells and energy
recovery ventilation to reduce fuel consumption and carbon
emissions to zero. Construction will be finished next month in
Herten, Germany, Daikin Europe  said  on its website.  
 Daikin will collaborate with Zeller Group, a German heat
pump and air conditioning installer of Daikin products, to
construct the house and install the various technologies and
monitoring equipment. The company is considering similar
projects in France in the autumn of 2011 and in the UK or Italy
in the spring of 2012.  
 Daikin plans to sell its energy efficient heat pump and hot
water systems, which combine the functions of an air conditioner
and water heater, in China and the U.S. this month, according to
a report by Nikkei English News.
