             Kevin Lew Chee Fai , found liable in
Singapore’s first civil lawsuit for insider trading, said he
will appeal the ruling against him.  
 The former chief financial officer of  WBL Corp.  said in an
interview that his lawyer Thio Shen Yi from TSMP Law Corp. will
seek approval to appeal from the Singapore High Court this week.  
 Lew faces a civil penalty of between S$50,000 ($36,000) and
S$81,000. The court found he avoided a loss of S$27,000 by
selling shares of WBL, a Volvo and Jaguar car distributor, two
days after learning it was forecast to report losses on July 2,
2007. The  Monetary Authority of Singapore  said after winning the
case in May that it will enforce the city’s insider trading laws.  
 “My intention is to appeal,” Lew, 50 and unemployed since
July 2007 when he was asked to resign, said by telephone from
Singapore yesterday. Lew said he didn’t believe the matters
discussed on July 2, 2007, were price sensitive and sold the
shares to raise cash to exercise his WBL options, according to
court papers.  
 He sold 90,000 WBL shares at S$4.98 each on July 4, 2007,
even after the company’s in-house lawyer said the information
shared at the meeting was price-sensitive. Lew would have
complied with insider-trading provisions had he sold the shares
on Aug. 16, 2007, when the average price of WBL shares was
S$4.68, Judge  Lai Siu Chiu  said in her 68-page ruling.  
 Volatile Forecasts  
 The financial forecasts given at the July 2 meeting were
“volatile” and could not be “reasonably relied on,” Lew said,
according to court documents. He was also under the impression
that the share trading blackout had been lifted when he sold the
stock, according to court papers.  
 “Insider trading unfairly tilts the playing field against
other market participants and undermines investor confidence in
the integrity of our capital markets,” Leo Mun Wai, assistant
managing director of the regulator’s capital markets group, said
after the verdict.  
 Drew & Napier LLC is acting for the monetary authority. The
regulator has also sued  Tan Chong Koay  and Pheim Asset
Management Sdn. in the city’s first civil lawsuit for stock
rigging.  
 WBL  shares have fallen 7.8 percent this year, compared with
a 1.2 percent decline on the benchmark Straits Times Index.  
 The case is Monetary Authority of Singapore vs Kevin Lew
Chee Fai S71/2009 in the Singapore High Court.
