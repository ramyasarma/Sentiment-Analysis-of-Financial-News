             Treasuries advanced, pushing two-
year  yields  to a record low and 10-year yields below 3 percent
for the first time since April 2009, amid concern European
governments’ attempts to rein in debt will hinder growth.  
 Government bonds are headed for their best quarter since
the 2008 financial crisis. Pacific Investment Management Co.,
which runs the world’s biggest bond fund, said inflation will
stay low for the rest of the year.  
 “There’s risk aversion, and nervousness about the euro-
land debt crisis isn’t going away,” said  Jesper Fischer- Nielsen , a senior fixed-income strategist in Copenhagen at
Danske Bank A/S. Investors have also pushed “any speculation
about the Federal Reserve tightening back to a more distant
future,” supporting demand for government debt, he said.  
 The yield on the two-year  note  fell two basis points to
0.62 percent as of 7:46 a.m. in New York, according to BGCantor
Market Data. The 0.625 percent security due June 2012 rose 1/32,
or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100 1/32.  
 The two-year yield slid as low as 0.5857 percent. The prior
record of 0.6044 percent was set on Dec. 17, 2008, after the Fed
cut its  target  for overnight bank lending to a range of zero to
0.25 percent. It has held the rate there since.  
 Ten-year yields dropped five basis points to 2.97 percent,
after touching 2.95 percent, the least since April 2009. The 30-
year yield fell to as low as 3.95 percent, the least since Oct.
2, 2009.  
 Stocks Slide  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell to a two-week low amid
concern China’s economy is growing at a slower pace than
estimated. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 1.8 percent, its
fifth decline in six days. U.S. stock-index futures also
declined.  
 Bond yields surged in Greece, Portugal and Spain, driving
the euro to a four-year low against the dollar this month and
cutting demand for higher-yielding securities.  
 U.S. government securities have returned 4.4 percent this
quarter, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, as
the 10-year yield has plunged from its 2010 high of 4.01 percent
reached on April 5.  
 Shift to Safety  
 The last time Treasuries rallied as much was when they
gained 9 percent in the last three months of 2008 as credit
markets froze around the world following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in September that year.  
 U.S. government securities are still the place to be, said
Marvin Barth, chief investment strategist at Tennenbaum Capital
Partners LLC, a private investment company is Santa Monica,
California.  
 A Bank of America index of company bonds yields 3.14
percentage points more than Treasuries, widening from 2.37
percentage points in April as investors sought U.S. government
securities over company debt.  
 German bunds advanced 4 percent this quarter, U.K. gilts
rallied 4.2 percent, and Japanese bonds gained 1.9 percent, the
indexes show. The  MSCI World  Index of shares declined almost 11
percent in the period.  
 The Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence fell to
62.5 in June from 63.3 the prior month, a Bloomberg News survey
of economists showed before a report today. U.S. employment
figures later this week will show the nation lost 115,000 jobs
in June, economists said.  
 Treasuries also rallied after a report yesterday indicated
inflation was contained last month.  
 Inflation Outlook  
 “Inflation is unlikely to accelerate in the near term,”
 Mihir Worah , an investor at Newport Beach, California-based
Pimco said on the company’s website. “As we move into 2011, and
the latter half of 2011, we are likely to see signs inflation is
gathering momentum.”  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and Treasury
Inflation Protected  Securities , a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, was at 1.92 percentage points from this
year’s high of 2.49 percentage points in January.  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange show an 82 percent
chance the Fed will either maintain or reduce interest rates by
its December meeting, up from a 64 percent a month ago.  
 The 10-year yield on will fall to 2.75 percent as the Fed
steps up efforts to fight deflation, said Deutsche Bank AG.  
 “While we fear inflation is the biggest longer-term
concern, we see deflation as the bigger near-term risk,”  Jim Reid , head of fundamental strategy in London, wrote in a
research note today.
