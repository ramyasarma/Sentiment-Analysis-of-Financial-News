             China’s local-government financing
vehicles won’t create a “severe” problem based on initial
analysis by Moody’s Investors Service, said Tom Byrne, a senior
vice president of the rating company’s sovereign risk unit.  
 Moody’s expects any losses from the financing arms to come
in 2012-2013 rather than immediately, and any migration to the
central government’s balance sheet will be limited, Byrne said
at a conference in Shanghai today.
