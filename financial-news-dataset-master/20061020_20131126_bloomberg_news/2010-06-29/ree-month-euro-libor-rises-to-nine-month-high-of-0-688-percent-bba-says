             The rate banks say they charge each
other for three month loans in euros in London rose to the
highest level in nine months, according to the British Bankers’
Association.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
was at 0.688 percent, the BBA said, the most since Oct. 23,
2009. The rate was 0.679 percent yesterday. The euro Libor-OIS
spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, rose two basis
points to 30.2 basis points as of 11:40 a.m. in London.  
 Three-month dollar Libor was little changed at 0.533
percent.
