             Micron Technology Inc. , the largest
U.S. maker of computer memory, fell the most in 19 months on the
Nasdaq on concern it has too many unsold chips and that output
of other products isn’t increasing fast enough.  
 Micron slid $1.35, or 13 percent, to $8.67 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading , the biggest drop since
Dec. 1 2008, and the most of any stock in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. The shares have lost 18 percent this year.  
 While the company reported a third-quarter profit of $939
million yesterday, helped by one-time accounting gains from the
acquisition of Numonyx BV, that purchase also added inventory.
Micron is also trailing rivals including Samsung Electronics Co.
in ramping up production to take advantage of strong demand.  
 “People are concerned about Numonyx and the $700 million in
inventory,” said  Betsy Van Hees , an analyst at Wedbush
Securities in San Francisco. She has an “outperform” rating on
Micron stock and said she doesn’t own any shares.  
 Micron , based in Boise, Idaho, makes dynamic random access
memory, or DRAM, chips that provide the main memory in personal
computers. The company also makes Nand flash memory chips used
in portable music players like Apple Inc.’s iPod and in memory
cards for digital cameras.  
 Demand for those chips is still strong and inventory is
lean, Chief Operating Officer  Mark Durcan  said late yesterday in
an interview.  
 “Demand is very robust in every segment,” he said.
“Everyone essentially is asking for more than they can get right
now.”  
 Sales Gain  
 Some investors were also disappointed by the relatively
slow pace of Micron’s ability to increase output and take
advantage of strong pricing, said  Daniel Amir , an analyst with
Lazard Capital Markets in San Francisco. He recommends  buying 
the shares and doesn’t own any himself.  
 “You really don’t have growth in the DRAM business or the
Nand,” he said. “It’s unfortunate.”  
 Micron’s Durcan said that while his company is lagging the
expansion plans of rivals this year, he will reverse that
situation and increase market share next year.  
 Micron completed its purchase last month of Rolle,
Switzerland-based Numonyx, which makes a different type of flash
chips for mobile phones. There is little competition in that
market, meaning that Micron will likely be able to sell all of
the inventory it acquired, said Wedbush’s Van Hees.
