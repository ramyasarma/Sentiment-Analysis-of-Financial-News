             The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’  crude-oil output dropped from a 17-month
high in June, led by a decline in Nigeria, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  
 Production slipped 157,000 barrels, or 0.5 percent, to an
average 29.23 million barrels a day, according to the survey.
Output by members with quotas, all except Iraq, dropped 122,000
barrels to 26.865 million, 2.02 million above their target.  
 OPEC cut its quotas by 4.2 million barrels to 24.845
million barrels a day beginning in January 2009 as fuel demand
fell during the worst recession since World War II. Compliance
among the 11 members with targets rose to 52 percent from 49
percent in May.  
 “Much of this could have been engendered by lower
prices,” said  Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics
LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “There’s just
not as much of an incentive to produce oil.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery fell 31 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $75.63 a barrel today on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest settlement since June 14. Oil slipped 9.7
percent since the end of March, the first quarterly decline
since 2008.  
 Nigeria’s production tumbled 75,000 barrels to 2.01
million, the first decrease since February, according to the
survey of oil companies, producers and analysts. It was the
largest reduction of any member. Africa’s biggest producer
exceeded its quota by 337,000 barrels.  
 The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, an
armed group in the oil-producing region, called off a three-
month cease-fire on Jan. 30. Nigeria’s output plunged to 1.75
million barrels a day in July 2009, the lowest level since
August 1994, because of attacks by militants.  
 Iraqi output dropped 35,000 barrels to 2.365 million in
June, the second-biggest decrease in OPEC. The Persian Gulf
nation was the group’s third-largest producer this month.  
 Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, pumped 8.29 million
barrels a day in June, unchanged from the previous month. The
kingdom exceeded its quota by 239,000 barrels.
