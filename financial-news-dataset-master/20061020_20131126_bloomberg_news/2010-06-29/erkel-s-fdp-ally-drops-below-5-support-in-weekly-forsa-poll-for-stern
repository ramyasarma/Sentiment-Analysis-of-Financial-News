             German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
Free Democratic Party coalition ally fell one point to 4
percent, below the 5 percent level of support required to win
parliamentary seats, a weekly Forsa poll for Hamburg-based Stern
magazine showed today.  
 That’s the FDP’s lowest level of support since 2002, Stern
said in a e-mailed statement. At the September election, the
party won 14.6 percent.  
 Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc gained two points to 32
percent, while the opposition Social Democratic Party held at 27
percent, its highest score this year, the poll showed.  
 The FDP have no clear political direction and “stand there
almost naked,” Forsa head Manfred Guellner told Stern.
