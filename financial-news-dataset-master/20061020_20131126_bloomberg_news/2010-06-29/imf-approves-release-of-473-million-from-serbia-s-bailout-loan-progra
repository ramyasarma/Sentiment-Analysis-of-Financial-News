             The International Monetary Fund
finished a fourth review of its loan to Serbia and approved the
release of $473 million, the latest installment of a $3.9
billion standby arrangement approved last year.  
 “Economic performance continues to be broadly
satisfactory, in spite of a weaker macroeconomic environment
during the first half of 2010,” Murilo Portugal, an IMF deputy
managing director, said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  
 Drawing the full disbursement would bring the total Serbia
has borrowed under the 2009 loan program to $2.2 billion, the
fund said. The IMF also said it approved a request from Serbia
to waive end-of-March budget targets.  
 “Serbia’s external financing position has improved
markedly, the reserve position is broadly comfortable, and
inflation remains in check,” Portugal said. “Notwithstanding
these positive developments, Serbia remains vulnerable to
adverse financial spillovers from the region.”
