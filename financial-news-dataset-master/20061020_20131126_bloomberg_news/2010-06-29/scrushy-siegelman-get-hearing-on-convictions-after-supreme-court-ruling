             The  U.S. Supreme Court  told a lower
court to reconsider the public corruption convictions of
 HealthSouth Corp.  founder  Richard Scrushy  and former Alabama
Governor  Don Siegelman .  
 The justices today said a federal appeals court in Atlanta
should revisit its decision upholding the convictions in light
of the Supreme Court’s decision last week in the case of former
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Skilling .  
 Like Skilling, both Scrushy and Siegelman were convicted of
violating a federal ban on fraud schemes to “deprive another of
the intangible right to honest services.” In the Skilling case,
the high court cut back the honest services law, saying it could
be applied only in cases involving bribery or kickbacks.  
 Scrushy and Siegelman were both convicted of bribery as
well as honest services fraud, raising questions about whether
they can benefit from the Skilling ruling. In their Supreme
Court appeals, they argued that prosecutors were required to
prove that Siegelman explicitly promised Scrushy a seat on a
state hospital regulatory board in exchange for $500,000 in
campaign contributions.  
 Scrushy, 57, was sentenced to six years and 10 months. He
is serving time in a Beaumont, Texas, federal prison because a
judge ruled him a flight risk.  
 Siegelman, 64, received a seven-year sentence and has been
free on bail during his appeal. In a separate proceeding, the
Democrat is seeking a new trial on grounds that a trial witness
was improperly coached and that federal prosecutors withheld
potentially exonerating evidence.  
 Siegelman was also convicted of obstruction of justice.  
 The cases are Scrushy v. United States, 09-167, and
Siegelman v. United States, 09-182.
