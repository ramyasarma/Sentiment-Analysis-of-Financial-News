             China’s small-company stocks plunged
today, led by health-care and technology companies, on concern
they are overvalued given the prospects for slower economic
growth.  
 The CSI Smallcap 500 Index, which trades at 40 times
reported earnings, slid 4.9 percent to 3,768.99 at 2 p.m. The
Shenzhen Composite Index dropped 4.5 percent to 967.81. The
Shanghai Composite Index, which trades at 18 times reported
earnings, slid 3.3 percent.  
 “The major problem with small-cap stocks is their high
valuations,” said Zheng Tuo, president of Shanghai Good Hope
Equity Investment Management Co. “There’s no way they can hold
such a high valuation amid the economic slowdown.”  
 The Conference Board corrected its April gauge for the
outlook of China’s economy, saying its leading index for the
country rose the least since November, rather than registering
the biggest gain in 14 months.
