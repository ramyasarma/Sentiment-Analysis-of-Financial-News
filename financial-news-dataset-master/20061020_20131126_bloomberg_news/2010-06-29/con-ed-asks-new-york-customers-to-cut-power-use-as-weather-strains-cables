             Consolidated Edison Inc. , the owner
of New York City’s largest utility, asked some customers in
Brooklyn to cut their power usage after demand due to record-
high temperatures strained cables.  
 Con Edison asked 123,000 customers to switch off “non-
essential” equipment, Sara Banda, a spokeswoman, said in a
telephone interview today. The company issued its request last
night and reiterated it today.  
 The temperature at New York’s John F. Kennedy International
Airport rose to a record 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) for
June 28, according to Sean Potter, a spokesman for the National
Weather Service.  
 Summer heat brought power demand yesterday to the highest
so far this year, Banda said. About 1,100 customers are still
without electricity, she said.  
 The cable problems don’t have any effect on the rest of the
power system, Con Edison said today in an e-mailed statement.
The company has about 3.2 million electricity customers,
according to  Chris Olert , a spokesman.
