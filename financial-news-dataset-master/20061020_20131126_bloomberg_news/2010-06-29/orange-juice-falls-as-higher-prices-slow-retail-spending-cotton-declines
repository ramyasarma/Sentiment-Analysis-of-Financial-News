             Orange-juice futures fell on signs
that U.S. consumers are reducing purchases of the beverage as
grocers boosted prices. Cotton also declined.  
 Retail sales of the juice dropped 6.6 percent in the four
weeks ended June 12 from the year-earlier period, the Florida
Department of Citrus said today in a report, citing data from
Nielsen Co. Prices rose 1.6 percent on average to $5.62 a
gallon.  
 “With the weak economy, people are looking at cheaper
alternatives,” said  Fain Shaffer , the president of Infinity
Trading Corp in Medford, Oregon. “There are a lot of drinks on
the market now that compete with orange juice.”  
 Orange juice for September delivery lost 0.5 cent, or less
than 0.1 percent, to $1.429 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York.  
 The commodity is up 5.6 percent in the second quarter and
11 percent this year, partly on prospects for improved demand as
the economy rebounded from recession and a smaller orange crop
in Florida, the world’s largest grower after Brazil.  
 The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities dropped
2.8 percent, the biggest slide since last August, after reports
showed U.S. consumer confidence weakened and that China’s
economy may have slowed.  
 In another ICE market, cotton futures for December delivery
fell 0.32 cent, or 0.4 percent, to 78.13 cents a pound. Earlier,
the price declined to 77.04 cents, the lowest level for the
most-active contract since June 9.
