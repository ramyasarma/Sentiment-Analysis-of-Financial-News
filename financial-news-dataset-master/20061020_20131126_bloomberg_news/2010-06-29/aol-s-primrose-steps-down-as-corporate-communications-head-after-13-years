             AOL Inc. ’s  Tricia Primrose ,
executive vice president of corporate communications, is
stepping down after more than 13 years with the Internet
company, predating the company’s merger with  Time Warner Inc.   
 Primrose is moving into an advisory role at AOL in order to
spend more time with her family, Chief Executive Officer  Tim Armstrong  announced today in a memo to staff.  
 During her tenure, Primrose worked for AOL leaders,
including  Steve Case ,  Jonathan Miller ,  Randy Falco  and
Armstrong. She shaped the company’s communication plans during
the $124 billion combination with Time Warner in 2001,
shareholder lawsuits regarding the deal, the transition to an
advertising-based business from one dependent on dial-up
Internet subscribers and the December spinoff of AOL into a
publicly traded company.  
 AOL, based in New York, plans an external and internal
search for her successor, Armstrong wrote. Primrose’s departure
was previously reported by All Things D.  
 AOL fell $1.16, or 5.3 percent, to $20.62 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have dropped
12 percent since the Dec. 10 spinoff.
