             Ford Motor Co. plans to expand the
staff at its plant near St. Petersburg by almost 10 percent to
meet rising demand for its Focus and Mondeo models as Russia
offers incentives to buy new cars and the economy expands.  
 Ford will hire 230 people to start at the Vsevolozhsk plant
in August, the Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement.
