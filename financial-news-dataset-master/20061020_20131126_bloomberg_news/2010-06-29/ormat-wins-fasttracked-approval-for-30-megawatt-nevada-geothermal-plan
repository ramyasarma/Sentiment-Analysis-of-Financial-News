                  June 28 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- The U.S. Bureau
of Land Management has approved plans by geothermal developer
 Ormat Technologies Inc.  to build a 30 megawatt project under a
“fast-track” regulatory process.  
 Nevada-based Ormat will develop the 15 megawatt first
phase for operation by late 2010, the bureau said in a
statement. A second plant may be built in 2011, with 85
percent of the entire project located on bureau land in
Pershing and Lander counties.  
 Ormat is the second geothermal developer to get fast-
track approval in the state, following the October 2009
commissioning of the 49.5 megawatt Blue Mountain project by
 Nevada Geothermal Power Inc.  Ormat was involved in that
project.  
 Ormat’s 30 megawatt McGinness Hills project in Lander
County is also a fast-track candidate project awaiting
approval, as are 186 megawatts of Terra-Gen Power LLC projects.
Nevada has a total of 325 megawatts of geothermal generating
capacity spread over 11 projects, with three on bureau-managed
public land.  
 In early June, Ormat said it would accelerate its
exploration work in Alaska this summer following the signing
of Senate Bill 243 in that state which will reduce the rate of
royalties paid for geothermal production on state lands to the
same rate as Federal land.
