             GDF Suez SA  was named the preferred
bidder to build two power plants in South Africa for an
estimated 5 billion rand ($658 million),  Sake24  said, citing
Ndivhuwo Khangale, a spokesman for the department of energy.  
 The department wants to build a 750-megawatt power plant in
Kwazulu-Natal province and a 330-megawatt plant at Coega in the
Eastern Cape province, both fired with diesel, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper said. It added that EDF SA, another bidder that,
like GDF Suez, has its headquarters in Paris, had withdrawn from
the process earlier.
