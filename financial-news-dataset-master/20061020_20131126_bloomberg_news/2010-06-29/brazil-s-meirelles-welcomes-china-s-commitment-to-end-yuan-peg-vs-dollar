             Brazilian central bank President
Henrique Meirelles said his country welcomes China’s commitment
to end the yuan’s fixed exchange-rate peg to the dollar and
urged “a faster move rather than a slower move.”  
 “In terms of the pace, evidently it remains to be seen
exactly how the Chinese authorities are going to move,”
Meirelles said today in an interview in Brussels. “We are not
making projections on that,” he said, calling it “a
prerogative of the Chinese authorities.”  
 China this month committed to ending its currency’s fixed
peg to the dollar. The yuan had been held at 6.83 per dollar
since July 2008 after a 21 percent gain the three prior years.  
 “We would welcome a faster move rather than a slower
move,” Meirelles said. Global imbalances are “one of the most
important issues to be resolved in the world economy,” he said.  
 He said Brazil’s financial system “has shown a very good
resilience” to the global financial crisis. “The Brazilian
financial system made no contribution for the present economic
crisis,” Meirelles said.
