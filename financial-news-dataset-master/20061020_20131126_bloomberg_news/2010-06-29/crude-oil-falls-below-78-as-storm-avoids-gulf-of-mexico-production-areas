             Crude oil fell for a second day in
New York on concern slower economic growth may curb demand and
as a tropical storm avoided Gulf of Mexico production areas.  
 Oil for August delivery dropped as much as $1.35, or 1.7
percent, to $76.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
and was at $76.96 at 2:29 p.m. Singapore time.
