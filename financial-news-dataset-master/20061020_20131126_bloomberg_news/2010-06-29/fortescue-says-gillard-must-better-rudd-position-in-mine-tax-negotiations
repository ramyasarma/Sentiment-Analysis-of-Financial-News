             Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. ,
Australia’s third-largest iron ore miner, said new Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  must make more concessions on a planned
mining tax than canvassed by her predecessor  Kevin Rudd .  
 Possible changes to the tax included reducing the effect of
its retrospectivity, an immediate write-off for new capital and
increasing the proposed return on investment trigger to 15
percent from 6 percent, Fortescue today said in a statement. A
discussion paper was set to be released before Rudd was ousted
last week as leader, the company said.  
 “We had reached a set of points which I think the prime
minister was happy with, the mining industry would have been
prepared to discuss and that was all taken off the table before
it could be announced,” Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Forrest 
told reporters in Perth today. “It was a shame really that it
got cut off so violently.”  
 Gillard vowed to resolve a standoff with mining companies
over the tax proposal after taking power.  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and
Rio Tinto Group, the world’s largest and third-largest mining
companies, suspended their anti-tax advertising as a sign of
good faith after her appointment.
