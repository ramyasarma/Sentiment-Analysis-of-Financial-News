             Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga 
had surgery to relieve a pressure build-up in the left side of
his head, Nairobi Hospital Chief Executive Officer Cleopa Mailu
said.  
 The procedure was carried out “successfully,” Mailu said in
a statement read over the phone by a hospital spokesman today
from the capital. Odinga may have suffered an injury when he hit
his head on a car door “a few” weeks ago, Mailu said.  
 The 65-year-old leader checked himself into the hospital
yesterday complaining of symptoms associated with “general
exhaustion,” his office said in a statement earlier today. His
doctors recommended he remain hospitalized for a few days to
recover, it said.  
 Odinga was appointed prime minister in April 2008, when he
signed a power-sharing agreement with President  Mwai Kibaki . The
accord ended two months of ethnic clashes sparked by a disputed
presidential election that Kibaki said he won. An estimated
1,500 people died and 300,000 were driven from their homes in
two months of fighting.  
 Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy, is the world’s
largest exporter of black tea.
