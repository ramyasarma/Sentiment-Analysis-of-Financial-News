-- Home Prices in U.S. Probably Rose, Consumer Confidence Declined

             Home prices rose as sales got a
boost from a tax credit, while consumer confidence cooled from a
two-year high, signaling a pickup in employment is needed to
sustain the recovery, economists said before reports today.  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller index of April property values in 20
cities climbed 3.4 percent from the same month in 2009,
according to the  median forecast  of 26 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The Conference Board’s sentiment  gauge  fell to
62.5 in June from 63.3 the prior month, the survey showed.  
 The end of a government homebuyer incentive worth as much
as $8,000, mounting foreclosures and unemployment near a 26-year
high threaten to set real estate prices back following the
stabilization that began earlier this year. Eroding home equity
may limit household spending, the biggest part of the economy,
even as gains in income help revive demand.  
 “The worst is behind us but the potential for further
price declines still exists,” said  David Semmens , an economist
at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. “With the expiration of
the tax credit, demand has collapsed. Why would consumers commit
to buying a house when they’re feeling nervous about job
prospects?”  
 The home-price figures are due at 9 a.m. New York time.
Estimates ranged from increases of 1.3 percent to 4.1 percent,
after a 2.3 percent year-over-year gain in March.  
 The Conference Board, a New York-based research group, will
issue the sentiment report at 10 a.m.  Estimates  ranged from 59.5
to 65. May’s reading was the highest since March 2008. The
measure averaged 45 in 2009 and 97 during the expansion that
ended in December 2007.  
 Conflicting Reports  
 The projected drop contrasts with a report last week that
showed the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment increased in June to the highest level since
January 2008.  
 Consumers spent less in the first quarter than previously
estimated, and the world’s largest economy expanded at a slower
pace, revised government data showed last week. Improvement in
the job and housing market will be needed to lift confidence and
in turn, spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the
economy.  
 The home price gauge fell 0.1 percent in April compared
with the prior month, according to the Bloomberg survey.  
 The year-over-year gauge provides better indications of
trends in prices, the group has said. The panel includes  Karl Case  and  Robert Shiller , the economists who created the index.  
 Builder Sales  
 Builders from  KB Home  to Lennar Corp. and  Toll Brothers
Inc.  are reporting falling sales after the extended tax credit
for homebuyers expired. To qualify, buyers had to sign contracts
by April 30 and must close transactions by June 30.  
 Los Angeles-based KB Home, which targets first-time buyers,
reported a wider-than-estimated loss for the quarter ended May
31 as new orders declined 23 percent and the average price for
its houses fell 4 percent from a year ago.  
 “Homebuyers who missed the deadline seemed to step out of
the market completely,” KB Home Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Mezger  said in a June 25 conference call with analysts. It’s too
early in the third quarter to forecast demand, he said.  
 “It’s a matter of when, not if, things are going to
improve,” Mezger said.  
 The S&P Supercomposite Homebuilder  Index , which includes
Toll and Lennar, has dropped 28 percent since reaching a 19-
month high on May 3. The broader S&P 500 Index is down 12
percent from April 23’s 19-month peak.  
 Little Consensus  
 There is little consensus on the outlook for property
values. About half of 106 U.S. forecasters in a study published
June 23 by MacroMarkets LLC expect price declines in 2010 and
half anticipate either little-change or increasing values.  
 Purchases  of new homes plunged by a record in May from the
prior month, and the median price declined from a year earlier
to the lowest level since December 2003, Commerce Department
data showed. The National Association of Realtors reported a
drop in May sales of  existing  houses.  
 Foreclosures may be an obstacle for the market for much of
the year. More than a fifth of U.S. mortgage holders owed more
than their homes were worth in the first quarter, Seattle-based
Zillow.com said last month.
