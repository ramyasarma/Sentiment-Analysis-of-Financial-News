              Formosa Petrochemical Corp. ,
Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil refiner, said it has brought
forward planned maintenance at its No. 2 ethylene plant because
of a contractor’s schedule.  
 The plant, able to produce 1.035 million metric tons of
ethylene a year, will shut around Aug. 20 for the maintenance,
rather than in September, spokesman Lin Keh-yen said by phone
from Taipei today. The stoppage will last between 40 and 45 days,
he said.  
 Formosa Petrochemical, based in Mailiao, western Taiwan,
has three naphtha-processing  plants  with a combined annual
capacity of 2.935 million tons of ethylene, a raw material for
plastics, chemicals and synthetic fibers.  
 The company is currently running the plants at full
capacity to meet demand for petrochemicals, he said.
