             Brazil’s broadest measure of
 inflation  in June eased from the previous month as iron ore
prices rose at a slower pace, and food prices fell.  
 Consumer, construction and wholesale prices as measured by
the  IGP-M  index rose 0.85 percent in June, higher than the
median 0.80 percent forecast of 30 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The index climbed 1.19 percent in May, the Getulio
Vargas Foundation said on its website.  
 The wholesale component, which has a 60 percent weighting
in the IGP-M, rose 1.09 percent during the month, led by a 23
percent rise in iron ore prices. This was less than half the
49.76 percent increase in iron ore prices in May, after Vale SA,
the world’s biggest supplier of iron ore, raised its quarterly
contract prices in response to surging demand for steel from
China.  
 Consumer prices fell 0.18 percent, led by a 1.36 percent
fall in food prices, today’s report said.  
 “The main cause of the increase we have seen in the IPG-M
in the last two months is iron ore, because of the rise in
Vale’s contract price,” said  Newton Rosa , chief economist at
Sao Paulo-based SulAmerica Investimentos. “But now this
pressure is fading, and food prices are helping to keep IGP-M
inflation down,” Rosa added.  
 Today’s number was in line with market expectations, and so
neutral for the bond market and the central bank, Rosa said.  
 The IGP-M index is up 5.17 percent from a year ago. The
IGP-M, which is used to calculate increases in some rents,
utility contracts and school fees, will end 2010 at 9.08
percent, according to the median forecast in a central bank
 survey  of about 100 economists published yesterday.  
 The central bank will raise the benchmark interest rate to
11 percent at its July 20-21 meeting, as 2010 growth
expectations increased for a 15th straight week, the survey
found.  
 Policy makers have raised Brazil’s  benchmark  Selic rate
twice this year to 10.25 percent, from a record low 8.75 percent
in March, to prevent Latin America’s biggest economy from
overheating. The economy grew 9 percent in the first quarter of
2010 from the same quarter a year earlier, faster than any other
Latin American economy.  
 The government’s benchmark IPCA price index rose 5.22
percent in May from a year earlier. Annual price increases have
exceeded the government’s 4.5 percent target every month this
year and are forecast to remain above that level until 2012,
according to the central bank survey.  
 The yield on the interest rate future contract due January
2012, the most actively traded on Sao Paulo’s BM&F exchange,
fell two basis points to 12.02 percent at 9:11 a.m. New York
time. The real weakened 0.7 percent to 1.7933 per dollar from
1.7803 yesterday.
