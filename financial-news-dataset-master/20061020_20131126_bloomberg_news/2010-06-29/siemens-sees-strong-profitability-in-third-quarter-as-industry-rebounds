               Siemens AG , Europe’s largest
engineering company, predicted “continued strong
profitability” in its third quarter as demand rebounds for
factory automation gear, health-care products and light bulbs.  
 Profit  at Siemens’s energy, health-care and industry
divisions will approach the 2.1 billion euros ($2.57 billion)
the Munich-based company reported in its fiscal second quarter,
Chief Financial Officer  Joe Kaeser  said in a  statement  today.
New orders and sales in the third quarter will exceed the
corresponding prior-year figures, Siemens said.  
 The Munich-based maker of power plants, trains and medical
scanners raised its  outlook  for full-year earnings on April 29,
and Siemens said today orders and sales rebounded simultaneously
for the first time in almost two years as customers restock
goods. Siemens relied on emerging markets and a recovery in its
short-cycle business to spur growth, Kaeser said.  
 “The rising order intake is a very good sign,” said  Theo Kitz , an analyst at Merck Finck & Co. in Munich, who recommends
investors buy Siemens shares. “The recovery is underway, even
though there are units that will need some more time.”  
 Profit at the  health-care business  will rise
“significantly” in the third quarter and fall slightly in the
energy business, Siemens said. The industry business may exceed
last year’s profit, Kaeser said.  
 Siemens’s equity investments will weigh on profit in the
quarter, and the SIS computer services unit will post a loss,
Kaeser said. Siemens is in the process of cutting 4,200 jobs at
the unit and has said it may sell the division at a later stage.  
 For the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, Siemens predicts its
so-called sector profit to rise to a record, topping the 7.47
billion euros earned last year. Sales will decline in a mid-
single-digit percentage range, Siemens has said.  
 Siemens shares have risen 17 percent this year, outpacing
the 4.1 percent gain of the 85-member Bloomberg  European
Industrials Index . The shares fell 1.57 euros, or 2.1 percent,
to 74.93 euros as of 12:38 p.m. in Frankfurt, tracking the
decline of the DAX 30 benchmark index.
