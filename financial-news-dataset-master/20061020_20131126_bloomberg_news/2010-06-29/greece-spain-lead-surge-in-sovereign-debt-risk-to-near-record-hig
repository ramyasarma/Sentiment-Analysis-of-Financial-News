             Greece and Spain led a surge in the
cost of insuring against losses on sovereign debt to near a
record as protests over austerity measures and concern banks may
struggle to fund themselves triggered a credit-market sell-off.  
 The  Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index  of default
swaps on 15 governments rose 6.5 basis points to 165, the
highest level in three weeks and approaching the all-time high
of 168.5 on June 4, according to CMA DataVision. Corporate risk
gauges climbed the most in more than a month.  
 Greek workers downed tools for the fifth time this year to
protest against pension cuts and looser labor laws. Swaps on
Spanish banks jumped after the Financial Times reported they are
asking the European Central Bank to ease the effects of the end
of a $540 billion funding program, which terminates this week.  
 “Markets remain very fragile and easy to spook,” said
 Juan Esteban Valencia , a credit strategist at Societe Generale
SA in London. “It just doesn’t take much to scare the market.”  
 Credit-default swaps tied to Greek debt jumped 13 basis
points to 1,101, having closed at an all-time high of 1,125 on
June 4, according to CMA. Spanish contracts rose 9 to a record
275 basis points before retreating to 270.5.  
 Contracts on Banco Santander SA, Spain’s biggest bank,
gained 10.5 basis points at 210.5 and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA jumped 15 basis points to 276. The Markit iTraxx
Financial Index tied to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers
rose 5 basis points at 170, JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices show.  
 Refinancing Operation  
 Banks must repay 442 billion euros ($540 billion) July 1
that they borrowed from the ECB a year ago under the so-called
Long-Term Refinancing Operation. Lenders in Spain, Ireland,
Greece, Italy and Portugal have about 151 billion euros of
central bank loans coming due this week, according to Barclays
Capital estimates.  
 Corporate bond risk also rose after the Conference Board
revised its leading economic index for China to show the
smallest gain in five months in April. Stocks plunged, Treasury
two-year note yields dropped to a record low and the yen
strengthened on concern that growth in the main engine of the
world’s economic recovery is slowing.  
 Credit-default swaps on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index
of 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 29
basis points to 574.5, according to JPMorgan, the highest since
May 25.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($12.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
