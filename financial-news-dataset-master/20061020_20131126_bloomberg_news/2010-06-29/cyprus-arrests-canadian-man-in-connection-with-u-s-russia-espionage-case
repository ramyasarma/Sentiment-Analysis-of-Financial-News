             Cyprus  police  arrested a
Canadian man in connection with U.S. espionage and money-
laundering charges involving a Russian spy ring.  
 A man identified by police as Robert Christopher
Metsos was arrested at the  Larnaca International Airport , a
spokesman for the Larnaca police department, who declined
to be identified, said today. Metsos surrendered his travel
documents and was released on bail of 20,000 euros
($24,000).  
 Cyprus officials are awaiting an extradition request
from the U.S. and a court hearing was scheduled for July
29, Michalis Katsounotos, another police spokesman, said in
a telephone interview.  
 U.S. authorities yesterday arrested 10 people for
allegedly spying for the Russian Federation in the U.S.,
the  Justice Department  said in an e-mailed statement. The
Federal Bureau of Investigation yesterday said Christopher
R. Metsos, a purported Canadian citizen, was an agent of
the Russian espionage agency and traveled to the U.S. to
pay others in the alleged spy ring.  
 The arrest was reported earlier today by Agence France
Presse and the Associated Press.
