             Singapore won’t be able to become
energy-independent because of its lack of natural resources,
said  Lee Kuan Yew , the country’s minister mentor.  
 The country can tap solar energy as a source of power,
while wind and nuclear energy aren’t options, Lee said at a
conference in the city state today. Neighboring countries may
raise the price of gas sold to Singapore even though a contract
is in place, he said.  
 “Our neighbors are thinking of upping the prices in spite
of a contract,” Lee said, without identifying any country. The
island nation is preparing a facility for liquefied natural gas
and plans to buy the resource from Qatar and store it, he said.  
 Indonesia will renegotiate its natural gas sales contract
with Singapore to meet domestic demand for the fuel, Investor
Daily Indonesia reported earlier this month, citing  Darwin Saleh ,
the nation’s energy minister.
