             Mexico’s peso dropped to the lowest
level in two weeks on concern growth in China may be slowing,
reducing demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  
 The currency dropped 1 percent to 12.8579 per dollar at
10:14 a.m. New York time, from 12.7332 yesterday. Earlier the
peso reached 12.8762, the weakest level since June 10.  
 “The larger move through 12.80 pesos is on concern that
China is growing more slowly than anticipated,” said  Clyde Wardle , an emerging-market currency strategist at HSBC Holdings
Plc. “It’s mostly global risk aversion.”  
 The Conference Board’s leading economic index for China
rose 0.3 percent in April, less than the 1.7 percent reported
June 15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index plunged 2.4 percent.  
 The currency dropped as much as 0.8 percent yesterday after
 Rodolfo Torre Cantu , candidate for governor in Tamaulipas, was
assassinated. Torre Cantu’s death was the highest-profile
killing of a politician in Mexico since 1994, when presidential
candidate  Luis Donaldo Colosio  was shot.  
 Colosio’s death helped shake investor confidence and
contributed to a peso devaluation later that year. Colosio and
Torre Cantu both were members of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party.  
 “A high level political assassination is bound to have
deeper ramifications,” wrote  Francisco Diez , director of
emerging-market trading at RBC Capital Markets in New York. “I
am a bit surprised the currency is not trading much weaker.”  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.25 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.26 centavo to 124.55 centavos per peso.
