             Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , the firm
run by billionaire  Warren Buffett , is a “buy” because its
earnings will grow as the U.S. economy recovers, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said.  
 Berkshire, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe
and auto insurer Geico Corp. and has stakes in firms including
credit-card lender  American Express Co. , may rise about 25
percent in 12 months, analysts led by  Christopher Neczypor  said
today in a research note. The note initiated coverage in the
Omaha, Nebraska-based company.  
 “The non-insurance entities are tied to GDP growth and to
a lesser extent, industrial production,” Neczypor wrote. “As
the economy continues to emerge from its cyclical downturn, we
would expect earnings to grow at a faster rate than what appears
to be currently discounted in the stock.”  
 Buffett, the 79-year-old chairman of Berkshire, executed
takeovers and stock picks to transform his firm over four
decades from a failing textile mill into a seller of bricks,
electric power and hurricane insurance with a market value of
almost $200 billion. He called his $27 billion purchase of
Burlington Northern, completed in February, an “all-in wager”
on the U.S. economy.  
 “Post the acquisition of Burlington Northern, we estimate
close to half of Berkshire’s intrinsic value will be derived
from operating entities, as opposed to securities investments,”
Neczypor wrote. This “reduces the long-term reliance on senior
management’s equity investing decisions, and provides greater
clarity into the source of future value for the company.”  
 Berkshire’s Class A shares  declined $1,001 to $120,199 at
4:15 p.m. today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
and have risen about 21 percent this year.
