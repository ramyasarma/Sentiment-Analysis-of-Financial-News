             Telecom Corp., New Zealand’s largest
phone company, will only proceed with a structural separation of
its network if the benefits outweigh the costs, Chairman Wayne
Boyd said in a statement.  
 Telecom will act in the best interest of shareholders,
whose approval will be required if the separation proceeds, the
Auckland-based company said today.
