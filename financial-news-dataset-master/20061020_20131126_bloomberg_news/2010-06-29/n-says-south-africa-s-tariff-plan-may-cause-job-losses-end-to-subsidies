             MTN Group Ltd. said plans by South
Africa’s telecommunications regulator to impose lower charges
for carrying rival phone operators’ calls may cause job losses
and force the company to end subsidies on handsets and SIM
cards.  
 “If interconnection rates are cut in the next few weeks
rather than a more gradual approach, the impact on the business
trying to rebalance itself may result in an increase in tariffs
or we may have to reduce costs by taking margins out
elsewhere,” MTN’s South African Chief Financial Officer Zunaid
Bulbulia said at hearings being held by the regulator in
Johannesburg today.
