             The dollar may be poised for a gain
versus the yen after reaching the lowest level in seven weeks, a
gauge of momentum indicates.  
 The 14-day relative strength index of the dollar versus the
yen was at 29.1 today, its first time below 30 since Dec. 1.
Readings below 30 indicate an asset’s value has fallen too fast
and may be poised to rebound. The dollar surged 4.7 percent
versus the yen in the first week of December after its RSI fell
below 30 on Nov. 25 and touched as low as 23.8 on Nov. 30.  
 “We’re very oversold, so the market is potentially running
out of downward momentum,”  Andrew Chaveriat , a technical
analyst in New York at BNP Paribas SA, said of today’s data.
“We’re vulnerable to a snapback reversal off these oversold
levels.”  
 The dollar is trading near 88 yen for the third time this
year, Chaveriat said in a telephone interview. It depreciated to
close to that in March and again in May. There is “good buying
interest” around the 88 yen level, he said.  
 The greenback weakened as much as 1.2 percent to 88.29 yen
today in New York, the lowest level since May 6, before trading
at 88.44 yen, from 89.37 yesterday. It has dropped 4.9 percent
against the Japanese currency so far this year.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
