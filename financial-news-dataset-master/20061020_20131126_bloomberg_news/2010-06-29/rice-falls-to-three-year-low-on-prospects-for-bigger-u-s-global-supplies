             Rice fell to the lowest price in
more than three years on expectations for a bigger U.S. crop and
increased world supplies.  
 The U.S. crop was rated 74 percent good or excellent as of
June 27, up from 55 percent at the same time a year earlier, the
 government said  yesterday. Global stockpiles will jump 7.4
percent to 96.3 million metric tons in the 2010-2011 marketing
year, the USDA said last month. World production may increase
4.3 percent to 459.4 million tons.  
 “The crop is looking really good,” said Milo Hamilton,
the president of Firstgrain.com, a rice advisory service in
Austin, Texas. “We have to compete on a milled basis, and we’re
not competitive on milled” rice, which is grain that has been
processed, he said.  
 Rice futures for September delivery fell 22 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $9.99 per 100 pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price earlier touched $9.845, the lowest since March 28,
2007. Futures have plunged 33 percent this year on rising
stockpiles and decreased demand for U.S. supplies.
