-- Strikeouts Show Pitchers Outdo Hitters Like No Time Since 1968

             The end of Major League Baseball’s
performance-enhancing drugs era is causing 1960s flashbacks.  
 With the baseball season almost halfway complete, 23 major-
league starting pitchers with at least 10 appearances have
earned run averages below 3.00. In comparison, there were 12 in
1998, when  Mark McGwire  and  Sammy Sosa ’s season-long home-run
duel marked the era of steroid use in the sport.  
 If the 2010 season ended today, pitchers’ ERAs and batters’
home-run totals would be their lowest in almost two decades,
while strikeouts are on a record pace.  
 “It might be the start of a renaissance of pitching,
simply because so many of them are very young,” said Gabriel
Schecter, a researcher at the  National Baseball Hall of Fame  in
Cooperstown, New York. “That’s what happened in the ‘60s. There
were eight, 10 of them who came along from the mid-60s on.”  
 He cited  Steve Carlton ,  Ferguson Jenkins  and  Jim Palmer, 
who all debuted in 1965, while  Tom Seaver  reached the majors in
1967. They are now Hall of Famers.  
 ERAs averaged 2.99 in the NL and 2.98 in the AL in 1968,
the only time they’ve been below three for a full season in
either league since 1919, according to  Baseball-Reference.com .
Through June 27’s games, they were 4.11 in the NL this season,
tied with 2002 as the lowest since 1993 (4.05), and 4.22 in the
AL, the lowest since 1992 (3.95). Fifty-three pitchers who
started at least 15 games posted ERAs under 3.00 in 1968, more
than twice the number so far this season.  
 In 1968, pitchers batted in both leagues. The American
League has had the designated hitter since 1973.  
 McLain, Gibson  
 The Detroit Tigers’  Denny McLain  went 31-6 with a 1.96 ERA
in 1968, while the St. Louis Cardinals’  Bob Gibson  was 22-9 with
a 1.12 ERA and 13 shutouts. Schecter, 59, wrote about both in
his 2002 book, “Unhittable! Baseball’s Greatest Pitching
Seasons.”  
 The National League won that season’s All-Star Game 1-0,
the lowest score ever for the midseason exhibition. The first
four pitchers the  winners used  are now in the Hall of Fame: Don
Drysdale,  Juan Marichal , Carlton and Seaver.  
 The scoring drought led Major League Baseball to lower the
pitchers’ mound from 15 inches to 10 inches, a move that caused
ERAs in each league to climb to at least 3.60 the following
year.  
 This year, the dominating pitchers include  Ubaldo Jimenez 
of the Colorado Rockies, who was 13-1 with a 1.60 ERA before
last night’s start.  Stephen Strasburg ’s 41 strikeouts for the
Washington Nationals through his first four career starts were a
major-league record.  David Price  (Tampa Bay),  Clay Buchholz 
(Boston) and  Phil Hughes  (New York Yankees), all in their mid-
20s, each already have 10 wins. The San Francisco Giants’  Tim Lincecum , 26, is a two-time Cy Young Award winner and the
Florida Marlins’  Josh Johnson , 26, has a 1.83 ERA.  
 Perfect Games  
 With perfect games by the Oakland Athletics’ Dallas Braden
and Philadelphia Phillies’  Roy Halladay  in 2010, this is the
first season since 1880 that two major-league starters had
retired all 27 batters they faced. Additionally, an  Armando Galarraga  outing earlier this month would have been perfect if
not for a blown call on the game’s final out.  
 Johnny Damon , the Detroit Tigers outfielder who is in his
16th major-league season, said it’s not just the top of the
pitching rotations that are good.  
 “You’re facing three aces on each team and the other guys
are No. 2s and threes, when they used to be fours or fives,”
said Damon, 36. “They’re coming after me with some real nasty
stuff these days.”  
 Batters’ Stats  
 The statistics hold up for hitters, too. NL teams are
averaging 0.90 home runs per game, which would be the lowest for
a season since 1993 (0.86); in the AL, teams are averaging 0.95
homers, the least since 1993 (0.91) as well.  
 Strikeouts went up as batters started hitting more home
runs in the 1990s. This season, they remain even though power
numbers have tailed off. Strikeouts per game are on record-high
pace of 7.07 in the NL and are 6.74 in the AL, just below last
season’s AL record of 6.78, according to Baseball-Reference.com.  
 “Nowadays there are probably some players that don’t hit
home runs who still strike out,” Tigers third base coach  Gene LaMont , a former major-league manager, said in an interview.
“If you’re not hitting home runs and you are striking out 100
times or whatever the number is, you need to be a different type
of hitter.”  
 Cloud of Baseball  
 John Smoltz , who had 213 wins and 154 saves during a 21-
year major-league career, said some the reasons pitching numbers
might be better now is because of mental adjustments players are
making from the steroid era -- what he called the cloud of
baseball.  
 Baseball began random drug testing for steroids in 2004
after survey testing a year earlier found that 5 percent to 7
percent of results were positive. Amphetamine testing began in
2006. McGwire, now a coach for the St. Louis Cardinals, said he
used steroids in 1998, when he hit a record 70 home runs, and
throughout his major-league career.  
 “We’ll see in time if the pitchers have caught up to the
ballparks, the strike zones, the hitters, but I wouldn’t count
on that,” Smoltz, 43, now a baseball analyst for Braves’ games
and Time Warner Inc.’s TBS, said in an interview. “I just think
the elite pitchers are dominating.”  
 Changing the Mound  
 Lamont, meanwhile, said he wonders if pitchers will get so
good that 1968’s numbers will look hitter friendly. Baseball
then might reverse its course.  
 “I guess they thought pitchers were too dominating and
they had to lower it,” said Lamont, 63, who was a catcher in
the Tigers’ minor-league system when McLain was piling up wins
in 1968. “Maybe if it keeps like this for three years, they’ll
put it back up.”
