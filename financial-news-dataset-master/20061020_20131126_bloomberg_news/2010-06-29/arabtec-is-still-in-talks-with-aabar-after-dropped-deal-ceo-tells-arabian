             Arabtec Holding PJSC  is still in
talks with  Aabar Investments PJSC  after the company dropped a
sale plan, Arabian Business  reported , citing Chief Executive
Officer  Riad Kamal .  
 The companies are “talking and probably will find a
formula that will achieve the intention of the original deal,”
Kamal was cited as saying in the report. “They had cold feet.”  
 Arabtec dropped a plan in April to be taken over by Abu
Dhabi-controlled Aabar for $1.74 billion. Aabar on Jan. 7
offered to buy 70 percent of Arabtec through the purchase of
bonds that would be exchanged for shares at 2.3 dirhams each.
