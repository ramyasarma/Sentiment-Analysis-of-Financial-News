             South Africa’s rand weakened against
the dollar and euro on concern economic growth in China will
slow, damping prospects for exports to the world’s fastest-
growing major economy.  
 The rand declined as much as 1.5 percent to 7.6742 per
dollar and traded 1.2 percent down at 7.6522 by 4:43 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a close of 7.5625 yesterday. Against the
euro, it lost 0.2 percent to 9.3148.  
 “The China issue is dragging on commodity-backed
currencies,” said  Elisabeth Gruie , an emerging-markets currency
strategist in London at BNP Paribas SA, France’s biggest bank.
“That’s the main source of distress for the rand.”  
 Investor sentiment worsened after the Conference Board said
its China leading economic index rose 0.3 percent in April, less
than the 1.7 percent gain reported June 15. China, which
overtook Germany as the world’s biggest exporter last year,
faces “strong headwinds” in the second half of the year from
policy tightening measures and the European debt crisis,
Citigroup Inc. said in a report today.  
 Government bonds fell in South Africa, with the price on
the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 dropping
16 cents to 122.57 rand. The yield on the bond increased 3 basis
points to 8.09 percent.  
 Investors pared bets that South Africa’s central bank may
lower its 6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next meets
on July 22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-
month contracts  for cash in three months rose half a basis point
from the previous close to 6.4350 percent. The rate reached a 6
1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.  
 The rand weakened versus 11 of the 16 most-actively traded
currencies monitored by Bloomberg.
