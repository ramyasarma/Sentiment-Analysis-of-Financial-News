             Asahi Broadcasting Aomori Co., a
television network in northern Japan, will cancel a one-day sumo
tournament planned for Aug. 12 after a number of wrestlers and
stablemasters admitted to gambling on baseball matches.  
 “We decided to call off the event given our purpose was to
nurture the young and promote traditional culture,” the company
said in a statement on its website.
