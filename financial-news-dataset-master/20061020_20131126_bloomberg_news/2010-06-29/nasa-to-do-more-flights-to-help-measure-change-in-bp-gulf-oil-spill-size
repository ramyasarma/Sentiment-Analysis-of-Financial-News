             The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration will use its equipment in a series of flights to
help measure the change in the size of the oil spill on the Gulf
of Mexico’s surface.  
 The flights will begin July 1 and continue until July 12,
 Stephen Cole , a NASA spokesman, said by phone today. The data
collected by the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer,
known as Aviris, will be provided to the U.S. Geological Survey
to analyze, he said.  
 This will be the second time NASA has used the equipment to
measure the spill. The first 11 flights took place between May 6
and May 25. Aviris was created to monitor the Earth’s surface
based on molecular absorption and particle-scattering
signatures, NASA said on its  website .  
 BP Plc’s well in the Gulf of Mexico is gushing as much as
60,000 barrels of oil a day, according to the most recent
government estimate, published on June 16.
