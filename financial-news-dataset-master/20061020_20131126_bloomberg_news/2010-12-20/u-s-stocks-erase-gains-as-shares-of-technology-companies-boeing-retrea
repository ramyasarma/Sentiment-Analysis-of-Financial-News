U.S. equities erased gains as a drop
in technology shares wiped out an early rally and Boeing Co.
tumbled on concern it may delay its 787 Dreamliner again.  Intel Corp. slumped following a Wall Street Journal report
that the chipmaker’s proposed purchase of McAfee Inc. faces
scrutiny from Europe’s antitrust regulator. Boeing slid 3
percent after the Seattle Times reported the company was
preparing to announce another delay to the 787.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,242.82 at 10:18 a.m. in New York after gaining 0.3 percent in
early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 21.84
points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,470.07.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
