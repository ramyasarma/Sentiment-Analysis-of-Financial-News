Grenades thrown by four attackers
killed dozens of people boarding a bus in Nairobi, and police
killed three suspects, the Daily Nation reported. At least 14
people were seriously injured, the newspaper said.  Kenyan police didn’t link the attack to terrorism, the
newspaper said. The police chief in neighboring Uganda, Kale
Kayihura, told AFP earlier that law enforcement there was on
alert for possible attacks by al Qaeda linked militants, the
Daily Nation reported.      To contact the editor responsible for this story:
