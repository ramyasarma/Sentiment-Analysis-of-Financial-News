Alpha Conde , the former university
professor and opposition leader who was named winner of  Guinea’s 
Nov. 7 election, will be inaugurated as president tomorrow,
ending a contentious campaign that saw at least seven killed.  The 72-year-old Conde was confirmed by the West African
nation’s Supreme Court Dec. 3 with 52 percent of ballots. Former
Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo came second and disputed the
results, alleging irregularities, though saying he accepted the
court’s decision.  Post-election violence between security forces and
supporters of the candidates flared after Conde was named winner
and kept the world’s top bauxite exporter under a state of
emergency last month.  Conde’s spokesman, Mamady Sinkoun Kaba, said Dec. 7 the
leader plans to offer ministerial posts to opposition figures as
a means to easing tensions in the country.  The election, which began with the first round on June 27,
is Guinea’s first democratic transfer of power since attaining
independence from France in 1958. It also marks a return to
civilian-led rule, following two years of military control after
a coup in December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
