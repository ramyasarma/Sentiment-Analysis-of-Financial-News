Oil traded within a dollar of a more
than two-year high amid speculation the U.S. economic recovery
will accelerate next year, boosting fuel demand in the world’s
biggest crude user.  Crude was little changed at about $88 a barrel in New York,
after paring gains as the dollar rose against the euro, damping
the investment appeal of commodities. Prices last week climbed
0.3 percent as an index of U.S. leading economic indicators
increased by the most in eight months and data showed business
confidence in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, climbed to a
record in December.  “Most people are quite positive on next year’s view and
are willing to take risks,” said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund
manager at Astmax Ltd. in Tokyo. “On Friday, the market was
quite positive, as were most of the commodities, even though the
dollar was quite strong.”  Crude for January delivery was at $88.11 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 9
cent, at 3:10 p.m. Singapore time. The contract, which rose as
much as 48 cents, or 0.6 percent, expires at settlement today.
The more actively traded February future added 7 cents to $88.67.  The dollar extended gains as South Korea started a live-
firing drill, plans for which prompted North Korean threats of
retaliation. The U.S. currency climbed as much as 0.5 percent to
$1.3125 per euro, from $1.3188 on Dec. 17 in New York.  The artillery exercise on Yeonpyeong Island, which was
shelled by the North last month, began at 2:30 p.m. local time,
said a defense ministry official who asked not to be identified,
citing government policy.  Economic Rebound  Oil, which surged 78 percent in 2009, is up 11 percent this
year on speculation the global economic recovery will boost
consumption. Prices rallied to $90.76 a barrel on Dec. 7, the
highest since October 2008.  The index of U.S. leading economic indicators, the New
York-based Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months, advanced 1.1 percent to the highest since
March. This matched the median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  The Munich-based Ifo research institute said its  business
climate index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, rose to
109.9 from 109.3 in November, the highest since records for a
reunified Germany began in 1991. Economists predicted a drop to
109, the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg News poll.  U.S. fuel demand jumped 6.5 percent in November to 20
million barrels a day, the industry-funded American Petroleum
Institute said in its monthly report Dec. 17.  Crude stockpiles  fell 9.85 million barrels to 346 million
in the week ended Dec. 10, according to the Department of Energy.
That’s the biggest decline since May 2008.  ‘High Volatility’  “Consumer demand becomes increasingly hard to measure
through the holiday season and end-of-year tax considerations
create noise in the DOE inventory reports,”  Stephen Schork ,
president of The Schork Group Inc., a consultant in Villanova,
Pennsylvania, said in a report. “We expect low volume and high
volatility due to the holidays.”  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reduced
 net-long position  in New York crude futures and options for the
first time in three weeks, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. Bets that prices will rise outnumbered short
positions by 205,890 contracts in the week to Dec. 14, the
Washington-based regulator said Dec. 17.  Brent crude for February settlement was at $91.75 a barrel,
up 8 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
