Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  paid
its lawyers and managers $45 million last month, bringing the
bankrupt firm’s total adviser fees to more than $1.1 billion
through November, according to a regulatory filing.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, which runs the
defunct investment bank through its co-founder,  Bryan Marsal ,
led recipients with $382.4 million in fees for “interim
management” for 26 1/2 months of work, including $12.6 million
in November, according to today’s  filing  with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP  of New York collected $254.6
million for acting as the investment bank’s lead bankruptcy law
firm, including $8.7 million last month.  Milbank Tweed Hadley &
McCloy LLP  got $83.5 million for advising Lehman’s creditors’
committee, with $7.9 million coming in November.  Lehman and its affiliates had cash and investments of $21.4
billion on Nov. 30, up from $21.1 billion on Oct. 31.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman has
said it may spend five more years selling assets to pay
unsecured creditors an average of 15.8 cents on the dollar. Its
payments to advisers haven’t faced major challenges such as
those in the bankruptcy of automaker Chrysler LLC.  Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on
Sept. 15, 2008, with assets of $639 billion. Creditors include
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  UBS AG , the New York Giants and Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority as well as individuals who hold
Lehman bonds.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
