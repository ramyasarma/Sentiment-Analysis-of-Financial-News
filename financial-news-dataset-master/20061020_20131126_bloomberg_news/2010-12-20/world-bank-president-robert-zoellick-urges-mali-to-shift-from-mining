The World Bank will back energy,
transportation and irrigation projects in Mali to diversify the
Sahelian country’s mining-dominated economy as its gold output
lessens, the bank’s President Robert Zoellick said.  Zoellick, on a two-day trip to the former French colony,
told Malian officials their government’s ongoing campaign to
boost manufacturing and commercial agriculture in the country
“will lay a stronger foundation for job creation and shared
growth,” according to a statement e-mailed to Bloomberg News
yesterday.  Gold accounts for 95 percent of Mali’s total extractive
industry revenue, the statement said. The West African nation
“is expected to produce less gold in the years ahead.” Cotton
represents 30 percent of the country’s exports, and involves a
third of its population, Zoellick said.  The World Bank will increase its primary line of
developmental aid to $160 million annually, up from last year’s
$140 million, to finance electrification projects and
agricultural improvements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
