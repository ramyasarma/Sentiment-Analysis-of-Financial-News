Bioton SA  jumped the most in more
than a year after signing a deal under which GlaxoSmithKline Plc
will distribute the Polish company’s insulin in Russia.  Bioton  surged as much as 0.02 zloty, or 14 percent, to 0.16
zloty, the biggest advance since September 2009, and was up 7.1
percent at 0.15 zloty as of 9:54 a.m. in Warsaw. The shares
closed at a record low of 0.14 zloty on Dec. 17 after they were
dropped from Warsaw’s benchmark WIG20 Index.  Glaxo will make a one-time payment of $7 million to Bioton
for exclusive rights to sell the products after the Warsaw-based
drugmaker meets the conditions of the agreement, including
registering the insulin through the European Medicines Agency in
all the European Union’s countries, Bioton said in a statement
on Dec. 18.  The Polish company estimates the value of the 15-year deal
at as much as $600 million,  Puls Biznesu  reported today, citing
Bioton Chief Executive Officer  Slawomir Ziegert .  To contact the reporter on this story:
