Manchester City captain Carlos Tevez
told his team that he doesn’t want to leave, a week after
requesting a transfer, the English Premier League soccer club
said today on its website.  Eight days ago the forward requested a transfer from City.
The player and club held talks, City said today.  “During the meeting, Carlos expressed his absolute
commitment to the club and formally withdrew his transfer
request,” City said. “Carlos’ contract remains unchanged and
both Carlos and the football club are keen to focus on the
opportunities that lie ahead.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
