Corn may rise for a fifth straight
week on speculation that demand for U.S. grain will increase as
adverse weather damages crops in other countries. Soybeans may
decline on slowing demand from China, the biggest consumer.  Fifteen of 29 traders and analysts surveyed from Chicago
to Tokyo on Dec. 17 said corn will rise, and 17 of 30
respondents said soybeans will fall. Last week, corn futures
for March delivery climbed 3.9 percent to $5.965 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest such gain in seven
weeks. Soybean futures for March delivery rose 2.2 percent to
$13.105 a bushel.  Last week’s gains were expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on Dec. 10. Since 2004, the surveys have
been correct 52 percent of the time for corn and 54 percent for
soybeans.  Bullish  on corn: 15   Bullish  on soybeans: 13
