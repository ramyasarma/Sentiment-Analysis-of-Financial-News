The Bank of England will start
raising interest rates within six months to curb inflation, the
Confederation of British Industry said.  The Monetary Policy Committee will increase its  benchmark
interest rate  by a quarter-point every three months from the
second quarter of 2011 until mid-2012, the London-based group
said in a report today. It will then step up the pace of
increases to end that year with a rate of 2.75 percent.  “The persistent strength of energy and commodity prices is
a growing concern, as it is likely to mean that inflation does
not fall back quite as sharply as many hope,” said CBI Chief
Economic Adviser  Ian McCafferty . “Growth at the start of 2011
is likely to be very sluggish, although we do expect the
recovery itself to stay on track.”  Bank of England policy makers remain divided over the need
to curb  inflation  or increase bond purchases to counteract the
effect on the economy of the government’s fiscal squeeze.
Inflation accelerated to 3.3 percent in November, surpassing the
government’s 3 percent limit for a ninth month.  Consumer-price growth will “significantly exceed” the
central bank’s 2 percent target next year and only fall “just
below” the goal in the first quarter of 2012, the CBI forecast.
Inflation will end 2012 at 2.4 percent, it said.  The pound was little changed against the dollar today and
traded at $1.5536 as of 10:41 a.m. in London.  Growth Forecasts  The CBI said the economy will grow 0.6 percent in the
current quarter before slowing to 0.2 percent in the first three
months of 2011. Growth will average 2 percent in 2011, it said,
maintaining a September prediction, and accelerate to 2.4
percent in 2012. It also forecasts  house prices  will fall about
4 percent next year and remain unchanged in 2012.  Gross mortgage lending fell 5 percent to 11.1 billion
pounds ($17.2 billion) in November from the previous month, the
Council of Mortgage Lenders said today. A separate report based
on data from six lenders published by the Bank of England showed
that banks granted 45,000 loans to buy homes last month,
compared with 44,000 in October, still less than half the peak
of the property boom in 2007.  The Bank of England left its  emergency bond-purchase plan 
unchanged at 200 billion pounds this month and kept the
benchmark rate at a record low 0.5 percent.  MPC member  Adam Posen , who has called for the bank to
increase stimulus, said last week policy makers shouldn’t
“overreact” to inflation, as it may slow below 1 percent in
two years. His colleague  Andrew Sentance , by contrast, has voted
to increase interest rates since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
