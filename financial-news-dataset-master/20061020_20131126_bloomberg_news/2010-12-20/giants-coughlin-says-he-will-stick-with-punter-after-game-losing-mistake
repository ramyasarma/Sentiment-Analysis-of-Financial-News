New York Giants coach  Tom Coughlin 
said he will stay with  Matt Dodge  as his punter, even after the
rookie’s failure to kick the ball out of bounds yesterday led to
a game-winning touchdown return by the Philadelphia Eagles.  With 14 seconds remaining in a tie game, Dodge was
instructed to punt the ball out of bounds to keep it out of the
hands of Eagles returner  DeSean Jackson . The snap was high and
Dodge punted a low ball down the middle. Jackson muffed the
catch, then picked up the ball and returned it 65 yards for the
game-winning score as time expired.  “He’s a young guy and he’s forced to do this under fire,”
Coughlin said at a news conference today at the team’s practice
facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey. “It’s not easy, but
he’s going to have to learn from it.”  The team did not discuss signing another punter and remains
confident that Dodge will be able to perform well in a similar
situation in the future, Coughlin said. Dodge, 23, was drafted
by the Giants in the seventh round of the 2010 draft from East
Carolina University.  “I’m a pretty resilient guy,” Dodge said today in a news
conference. “You put the human element in sports, stuff happens
sometimes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
