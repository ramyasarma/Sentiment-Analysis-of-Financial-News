(Corrects company name in first paragraph.)  Novozymes A/S , the world’s largest
maker of industrial enzymes, agreed to buy Merck KGaA’s
bioagriculture science unit for $275 million, adding a range of
products designed to improve yields.  EMD/Merck Crop BioScience, which makes natural inoculants
to improve plant health, has had an average annual growth rate
of about 15 percent over the last seven years, with expected
sales this year of $60 million, Novozymes said in a statement
today. The company will be integrated in Novozymes’ BioBusiness
unit, where research and development costs currently eclipse
profits.  “EMD/Merck Crop BioScience has a strong strategic fit with
our existing BioAg business,” said  Steen Riisgaard , chief
executive officer of Novozymes, in the statement. “Sustainable
products and technologies will in the future play an even
greater role in the agricultural industry as they allow
effective and more sustainable ways to grow crops.”  Novozymes entered the bioagricultural business in 2007 with
the acquisition of Philom Bios of Canada. It also bought
Brazilian microorganism maker Turfal on Aug. 12.  The BioBusiness unit targets reaching the overall Novozymes
profitability targets of more than 10 percent annual organic
sales growth and more than 20 percent operating profit margin by
2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
