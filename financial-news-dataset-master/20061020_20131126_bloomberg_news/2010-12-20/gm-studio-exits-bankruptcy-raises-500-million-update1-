Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. ,
distributor of the James Bond and Rocky movies, emerged from a
streamlined bankruptcy and raised $500 million to produce new
films and television series.  The studios’ lenders converted about $5 billion in debt for
equity, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. The new
equity holders in the studio include billionaire  Carl Icahn , who
will designate one of the company’s nine directors.  Gary Barber  and  Roger Birnbaum , executives at Spyglass
Entertainment Group Inc., will serve as MGM’s co-chairmen and
chief executive officers. The restructuring clears the way for
the studio to begin work on a slate that includes a new Bond
film and two movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Hobbit” to
be co-produced with Time Warner Inc.’s New Line Cinema.  At Spyglass, Birnbaum and Barber produced films including
the supernatural thriller “The Sixth Sense.” MGM got approval
Dec. 2 to reorganize under Spyglass Entertainment.  Financing was arranged by JPMorgan Chase & Co., the studio
said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
