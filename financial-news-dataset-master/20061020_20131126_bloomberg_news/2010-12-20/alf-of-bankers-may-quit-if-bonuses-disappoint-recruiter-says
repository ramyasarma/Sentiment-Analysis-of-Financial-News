Forty-eight percent of workers in
the financial services industry consider changing jobs if annual
bonuses disappoint, said recruiter  Astbury Marsden , which
advises companies in Europe and Asia.  Forty-five percent of the 1,122 bankers surveyed said they
expected bonuses to be higher this year than last, the London-
based recruitment firm said in an e-mailed statement today.
Collective bonuses are likely to be less than the 7.3 billion
pounds ($11.3 billion) paid last year.  “Employers could see unprecedented levels of staff
attrition,”  Jonathan Nicholson , managing director at Astbury
Marsden, said in the statement. “We could see large numbers of
staff defect to rivals.”  Pay in the sector increased 17 percent this year to
compensate for reduced bonuses, the recruiter said. Forty-five
percent of the workers anticipating a higher bonus this year
expect it will amount to 47 percent of their base salary,
according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
