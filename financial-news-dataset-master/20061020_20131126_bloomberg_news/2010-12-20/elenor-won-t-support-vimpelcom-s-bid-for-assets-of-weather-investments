Telenor ASA , which owns almost 40
percent of  VimpelCom Ltd.,  won’t back the Russian affiliate’s
bid for Weather Investments SpA assets, saying the move won’t
help the business or investors.  VimpelCom, Russia’s second largest mobile-phone operator,
agreed in October to buy Weather Investments’ 51.7 percent stake
in Egypt’s  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE  and all of Italian mobile
operator Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA. Weather’s shareholders
would get 20 percent of new VimpelCom shares, which at the time
of the deal were worth $4.7 billion, and $1.8 billion in cash.  “We strongly support VimpelCom’s expansion in accordance
with the principles agreed at the time the company was
created,”  Dag Melgaard , a spokesman at Fornebu, Norway-based
Telenor, said in a statement. “However, in our capacity as a
shareholder of VimpelCom Ltd., we do not believe this
transaction makes strategic or financial sense for VimpelCom’s
shareholders.”  Telenor Chief Executive Officer  Jon Fredrik Baksaas , who is
on the board of Moscow-based VimpelCom, told analysts in Moscow
in October that he favored the transaction. The deal would
create the world’s fifth-largest mobile-phone company with a
combined subscriber base of more than 174 million customers and
give VimpelCom, which has operations in many former Soviet
republics, access to markets in Africa and the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
