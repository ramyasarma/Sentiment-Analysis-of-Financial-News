Ingenico SA, the world’s largest
maker of card payment terminals, dropped as much as 7.1 percent
in Paris trading after the company said that a bidder for the
company has not been in a position to submit a binding offer
that is acceptable to its board.  The stock declined as much as 1.96 euros to 25.63 euros as
was down 6.3 percent at 25.86 euros as of 10:33 a.m.  Ingenico received a non-binding offer on Dec. 14 and has
“reviewed the content and the terms with the acquirer,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “At this stage
of the discussions, the latter has not been in a position to
submit a binding offer that could be accepted by the board,’’
the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
