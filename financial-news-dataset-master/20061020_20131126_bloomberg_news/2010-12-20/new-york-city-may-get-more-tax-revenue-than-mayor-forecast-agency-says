New York City’s rebounding economy
may produce $525 million more tax revenue this fiscal year than
Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  anticipated in his $65 billion budget
plan, the city’s  Independent Budget Office  said today.  The budget office,  a public agency  that acts as a financial
watchdog, said the added revenue may contribute to a $1.7
billion surplus, which may be used to prepay 2012 expenses. An
additional $790 million in higher-than-forecast revenue may be
collected in fiscal 2012, which begins July 1, the IBO said.
That would cut the city’s projected deficit to $3.2 billion in
fiscal 2013, $1.6 billion less than the mayor’s estimate.  The IBO said its $1.1 billion estimate for the city’s 2012
budget gap may swell by $2 billion or more if New York state
cuts aid to municipalities as part of its deficit-reduction
plans. Governor-elect  Andrew Cuomo  faces a shortfall of at least
$9 billion in the next fiscal year, which begins April 1.  By the end of 2010, employment in the city will have risen
by 52,000, or 1.4 percent, from the nadir reached in the fourth
wquarter of 2009, the IBO report said.  “This means that in one year, the city will have recovered
nearly a third of the jobs lost during the downturn, including
43 percent of the private-sector jobs,” the report said.  Job gains have come mostly from outside Wall Street, in
industries such as education, health care, tourism and business
services, the agency said.  Last week, the state labor department reported New York
City’s jobless rate fell to 9.1 percent last month from 9.2
percent in October, its lowest level since April 2009.  “We’re certainly not back to the boom times,” Bloomberg
said at a City Hall news conference today. “Revenues for New
York City are running at or slightly better than what we had
projected. And the fact that the state has this greater deficit
is just going to mean we will get hurt by that.”  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
