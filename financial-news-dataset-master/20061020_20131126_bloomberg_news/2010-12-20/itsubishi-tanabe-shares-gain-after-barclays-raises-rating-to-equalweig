Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp.
gained the most in more than two months in Tokyo trading after
Barclays Capital raised its rating for the Japanese drug maker
to “equalweight” from “underweight”.  The stock gained 3.1 percent to 1,364 yen as of 9:19 a.m.
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, headed for the biggest increase
since Oct. 1. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average was little
changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
