Fifth Avenue in Manhattan was
partially closed near the Metropolitan Museum of Art this
morning because of a report of a suspicious vehicle, the New
York City Police Department said.  The bomb squad was called to check the vehicle, said a
spokesperson for the department who declined to be identified.  The stretch of Fifth Avenue was closed to traffic and
pedestrians from 79th Street to 85th Street while police
examined the vehicle, a gray Honda minivan, the New York Daily
News said, without citing anyone specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
