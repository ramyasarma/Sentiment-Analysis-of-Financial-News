Swiss stocks  dropped for a second
day as investors speculated that European sovereign-debt concern
will linger into 2011.  The  Swiss Market Index  sank 16.91, or 0.3 percent, to
6,521.25 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich. The benchmark measure
has struggled to make any headway in 2010 after reaching its low
for the year in July. The broader  Swiss Performance Index  slid
0.1 percent to 5,852.96 today.  There has been “no lasting resolution to the sovereign
debt crisis and further threats of credit-rating downgrades
remain,”  Angus Campbell , the head of sales at Capital Spreads
in London, said.  Swatch Group AG and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, this
year’s best performers on the SMI, pulled the gauge lower today.
Swatch sank 0.6 percent to 422.30 Swiss francs. Richemont
declined 0.7 percent to 55.20 francs.  Adecco, the world’s largest supplier of temporary workers,
climbed 2.4 percent to 61.90 francs.  Von Roll Holding AG climbed 0.8 percent to 4.94 francs
after it forecast full-year sales of 550 million francs ($570.4
million) to 570 million francs. Von Roll also predicted an
“improved profit and positive” earnings before interest and
taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
