India’s power-station coal imports
may be 24 percent less than estimated by the nation’s Planning
Commission after the most rainfall in three years boosted
electricity generation from water, reducing demand for the fuel.  The South Asian nation may import 34 million to 35 million
metric tons of coal in the year ending March 31, I.A. Khan, a
joint adviser at the Commission, said in an interview in New
Delhi. The body that sets growth and investment targets in India
had forecast in April that 45 million tons may be imported
during the financial year.  “Hydro-power generation so far this year has been above
normal due to good monsoons,” Khan said in a Dec. 16 interview.
“That has taken the load off coal substantially.”  India uses coal to fire more than half of its power plants,
and the government estimates demand for the fuel in India may
more than triple to 2 billion tons in the next two decades.
Asia’s second-fastest growing major economy needs to increase
generation capacity 20 percent to 200,000 megawatts by 2012 to
sustain expansion, according to the power ministry.  Hydro-power output climbed 5.8 percent to 83,235 million
units in the eight months ended Nov. 30, according to the
Central Electricity Authority, a body that advises the
government on power policy and sets technical standards for the
industry. Generating electricity by using water from rivers and
dams to move turbines accounts for 22 percent of the nation’s
installed capacity.  The output of hydro-electric plants exceeded the
government’s target by 0.5 percent in the eight months ended
Nov. 30, while generation by coal-fired power stations was 4
percent less than planned, according to the Central Electricity
Authority.  “Usually, hydro generation is around 80 to 90 percent of
the target,” said Khan. Overall power demand fell during the
monsoon, he said.  Coal Stockpiles  Power plants in the country had coal stockpiles of 12.8
million tons, equivalent to 11 days of supplies, as of Dec. 13.
There were 25 plants with stockpiles of less than seven days,
which is considered critical, according to data from the Central
Electricity Authority.  India produces 530 million tons of coal a year and imports
about 67 million tons, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said
Sept 24. The country’s power plants may import 60 million tons
of coal in the financial year starting April 1, Power Secretary
P. Uma Shankar said Dec. 9.  India received 911 millimeters (35.9 inches) of rainfall
between June 1 and Sept. 29, exceeding the 50-year average of
889.2 millimeters, according to data from the India
Meteorological Department. That’s the heaviest since 2007.  Editors: John Chacko, Amit Prakash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
