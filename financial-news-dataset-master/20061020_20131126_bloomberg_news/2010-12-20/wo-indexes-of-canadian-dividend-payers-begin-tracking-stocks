Two indexes of Canadian dividend-
paying companies from Standard & Poor’s and Toronto Stock
Exchange operator TMX Group Inc. began today.  The  S&P/TSX Equity Income Index  consists of the 75 stocks
in the S&P/TSX Composite Index with the highest dividend yields.
The S&P/TSX Composite Dividend Index comprises all 168 stocks in
the composite with positive annual dividend yields.  S&P and TMX said they created the indexes because of
demand from investors looking for high-yielding equity
alternatives as income trusts including Canadian Oil Sands
Trust, Bell Aliant Regional Communications Income Fund and
Yellow Pages Income Fund have converted to corporations or
announced plans to do so.  The  S&P/TSX Income Trust Index  has shrunk to 39 companies
from 72 since the 2006 announcement of a Canadian tax-law change
that goes into effect at the end of this year.  Fifty-three of the S&P/TSX Equity Income Index members come
from the financial or energy industries, including Royal Bank of
Canada, Great-West Lifeco Inc. and pipeline company TransCanada
Corp.  The S&P/TSX Equity Income Index fell 0.2 percent to 99.84.
The  S&P/TSX Composite Dividend Index  rose 0.2 percent to 100.16.  To contact the reporters on this story;
