China’s stocks  fell the most in a
month as tensions in the Korean Peninsula fueled a selloff in
risk assets, adding to lingering investor concerns that the
government may raise interest rates to tame inflation.  Jiangxi Copper Co. and Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. dropped
more than 3 percent as commodities prices slid and the dollar
rose after South Korea said it will proceed with a live-firing
drill that has prompted North Korean threats of retaliation.
 Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co.  led a retreat among health-care
companies after the Economic Observer said the government may
cut medicine prices by 40 percent.  “The tension in the Korean Peninsula may fuel investors’
pessimism approaching the year end,” said Wu Yang, associate
director at Guotai Junan Futures Research Institute. “The
market always gets hit from these kind of shocks.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 60 points, or 2 percent, to
2,836.75 at 2:11 p.m., the most since Nov. 23. The  CSI 300 Index 
fell 2 percent to 3,162.72, led by healthcare companies.  South Korea commenced a live-firing drill, plans for which
prompted North Korean threats of retaliation, as the United
Nations Security Council failed to agree on steps to alleviate
tension on the peninsula.  Artillery positions on Yeonpyeong Island, which was shelled
by the North last month, began the exercise at 2.30 p.m. local
time after fog cleared, said a defense ministry official who
declined to be named, citing government policy. North Korea and
China are communist allies.  Jiangxi Copper, the biggest copper producer, slid 3.9
percent to 38.88 yuan. Aluminum Corp. Of China dropped 2.8
percent to 10.09 yuan.  Rate Concerns  Copper futures prices fell 0.3 percent in Shanghai. The
dollar advanced to $1.3150 per euro as of 11:33 a.m. in Tokyo
from $1.3188 in New York on Dec. 17, after reaching $1.3125, the
highest level since Dec. 2.  The  Shanghai Composite , the worst performer among major
Asian benchmarks this year, has fallen 10 percent since reaching
an almost seven-month high on Nov. 8, on concern that monetary
tightening will curb economic growth. The gauge has lost 14
percent this year.  “People are still worried about further policy tightening
such as interest-rate increases,” said  Larry Wan , Beijing-based
head of investment at Union Life Asset Management Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $2.21 billion. “The government
hasn’t increased rates yet as had been speculated by the market.
It’s like a sword hanging over the market.”  China Construction Bank Corp. paced declines for lenders,
falling 1.7 percent to 4.63 yuan. Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s
largest liquor maker by market value, plunged 4.6 percent to 195
yuan.  Rate Outlook  China’s inflation may exceed 5 percent to 6 percent in some
months of next year, the People’s Daily reported today, citing
Ba Shusong, a researcher at the State Council’s Development
Research Center. Inflation may be between 4 percent and 5
percent for the whole of 2011, Ba was cited as saying.  Central Bank Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said the government
will take stock moves into consideration when making policies.  “We are trying our best in making policy decisions to take
the stock market reaction into account,”  China Central
Television  reported on Dec. 18, citing Zhou. “But when you only
have a limited number of policy tools, you can hardly cover all
the bases.”  China increased interest rates in October for the first
time since 2007 as inflation reached 4.4 percent on an annual
basis, the highest since September 2008. Since then, the central
bank has raised reserve requirements for lenders three times in
five weeks. The last increase was on Dec. 10.  Drugmakers Fall  The National Development and Reform Commission may cut drug
prices by an average 40 percent for 658 different items for the
fourth time since 2009, the Economic Observer reported today,
citing unidentified drug company officials.  A gauge of health-care stocks fell 3.3 percent today, the
most among the 10 industry groups of the CSI 300.  Kangmei Pharmaceutical lost 6.2 percent to 20.80 yuan.
Beijing Tiantan Biological Products Corp. retreated 3.6 percent
to 23.03 yuan while North China Pharmaceutical Co. dropped 4.3
percent to 16.18 yuan.  China’s stocks are facing “headwinds” from retail
investor bullishness, surging volatility and the dollar,
according to China International Capital Corp.  Lower expectations for yuan appreciation, based on twelve-
month non-deliverable forwards, put “cold water” on the view
that currency gains will be used as an inflation-fighting tool,
 Hao Hong , Beijing-based global equity strategist, wrote in a
report today.  Twelve-month NDFs dropped 0.23 percent to 6.5339 per dollar,
as of 9:38 a.m. in Hong Kong. That reflects bets the currency
will strengthen 1.9 percent in one year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Irene Shen ,  Zhang Shidong . Editors:  Allen Wan ,  Richard Frost   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
