Pay for people in bonds, currencies
and commodities is likely to decline this year as firms
increased hiring after a strong 2009, and regulators focused on
large bonuses as those markets remained “sluggish,” according
to  Glenn Schorr , an analyst of brokerage stocks at Nomura
Securities International Inc. in New York.  “The more revenues are down, the tougher it will be on
compensation,” Schorr said in a radio interview today on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “We just draw the
correlation between revenues and compensation: they’re
inevitably tied on Wall Street and this year is no different.”  Revenue has declined between about 20 percent and 25
percent for Wall Street investment banks after “a really good
2009,” Schorr said. Subsequent hiring boosted costs since
salaries and bonuses make up about 70 percent of expenses at
these companies, he said.  “We have the unfortunate situation of revenues down and
head count up,” Schorr said. “It makes it a difficult year to
manage the expense line.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has climbed about 12
percent this year, after gaining 23 percent in 2009. U.S.
government debt is up 5.67 percent since last December, compared
with a loss of 3.72 percent the prior year, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
