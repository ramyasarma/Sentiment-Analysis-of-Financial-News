Raytheon Co. ’s agreement to buy
Applied Signal Technology Inc. for $490 million marks the
largest purchase by the missile maker since Chief Executive
Officer  William Swanson  took the helm.  Raytheon, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, has made 15
acquisitions since Swanson, 61, became CEO in July 2003,
according to Bloomberg data. The purchase of Applied Signal
today eclipses the $334 million paid for BBN Technologies, which
was completed in October 2009, according to a  regulatory filing .  The  acquisition  is the fourth announced by Raytheon in the
past 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. With $2.1 billion
in cash on its balance sheet and net debt of $177 million as of
September, Raytheon “is clearly overcapitalized,”  Sam Pearlstein , an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities in New York,
said in a note to investors today.  Raytheon “is not generating any return on the $2.1 billion
in cash on the balance sheet,” Pearlstein wrote. “This makes
buying any company that is generating income an accretive
transaction.”  The acquisition of Sunnyvale, California-based Applied
Signal, 90 percent of whose sales were to classified customers,
may expand Raytheon’s cyber-security services and offerings to
intelligence agencies. The deal doesn’t indicate “the start of
a larger acquisition push” by Swanson, Pearlstein said in an e-
mail.  Raytheon fell 21 cents to $44.96 at 4:00 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Applied Signal rose $2.79, or
8 percent, to $37.81 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  14 Times Earnings  Raytheon, maker of Patriot anti-missile systems and defense
electronics, is paying 14 times the projected 2011 earnings of
Applied Signal, Pearlstein said.  Applied Signal shareholders will receive $38 a share and
the transaction should close in 2011’s first quarter, Raytheon
said today in a statement. The offer is 8.5 percent more than
Applied Signal’s closing price of $35.02 on Dec. 17.  Boeing Co., which competes with Raytheon in defense
electronics, completed the purchase of an Applied Signal rival,
Argon ST Inc. of Fairfax, Virginia, for $775 million in August.  Applied Signal said Oct. 22 it was reviewing strategic
options and that it had hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch as
financial adviser, sending the shares surging 26 percent from
Oct. 21 through last week. Applied Signal employs more than 800
people across the U.S., according to its website.  Applied Signal provides the U.S. military and intelligence
agencies with equipment to locate and analyze electronic signals
and cyber-security systems to protect computer networks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
