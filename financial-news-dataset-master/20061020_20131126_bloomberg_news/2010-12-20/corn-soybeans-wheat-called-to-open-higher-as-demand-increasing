What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that rising
demand for ethanol and livestock feed will reduce U.S. grain
inventories, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc.
in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that too much rain in northern Brazil
and hot, dry conditions in Argentina may reduce production,
Gerlach said. Soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $4 higher per
2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open up 0.1 cent to
0.2 cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange after Informa Economics Inc. cut its U.S.
planting estimate and dry weather threatens to increase field
abandonment in the southern Great Plains, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
