Reported violent crimes in the U.S.
declined 6.2 percent in the first six months of this year, the
FBI said.  In its  preliminary report  for January through June 2010,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation said there was a 2.8 percent
decline in property crimes compared with the first half of 2009.  Fueling the decline were a 10.7 percent drop in robberies
and a 7.1 percent decrease in murders,  the bureau  said today.
Rapes fell 6.2 percent and aggravated assaults declined 3.9
percent.  The report showed that previous crime decreases are
continuing. In September, the FBI said violent crime in 2009
declined for the third year in a row. The violent crime rate
last year fell 5.3 percent, and property crime declined 4.6
percent.  Violent crime declined for cities of all sizes, the largest
decrease, 8.3 percent, occurring in metropolitan areas with
500,000 to 999,999 people. Only in the Northeast did murders go
up, increasing 5.7 percent.  In property crime, motor-vehicle thefts dropped 9.7
percent, burglaries decreased 1.4 percent and larceny thefts
fell 2.3 percent. Arsons fell 14.6 percent across the country.  The report is based on data from more than 12,000 law
enforcement agencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
