Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” for a second day at all three roadside monitoring
stations, including the Central business district, the city’s
Environmental Protection Department said on its website.  The pollution index was 145 in Causeway Bay, 130 in Central
and 125 in Mong Kok as of 5 a.m., the department said. Pollution
was “very high” in the general monitoring stations in outlying
areas of Tung Chung and Yuen Long.  Roadside pollution above 100 triggers a government warning
for people with heart or respiratory ailments to avoid prolonged
stays and reduce exertion in heavy traffic areas. Pollution
above 100 at general stations triggers a higher warning for
people with those illnesses to reduce outdoor activities. They
are advised to seek medical advice before participating in
sports.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
