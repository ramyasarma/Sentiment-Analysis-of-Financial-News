World zinc mining companies may
pay 15 to 20 percent less to smelters for processing raw
material into refined metal next year after fees dropped in
the cash market, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  “Assuming a basis zinc price of $2,000 a metric ton, we
could see a base treatment charge of about $200-$210 a dry
metric ton,” the bank said in a report today. This would be
a reduction of about $40-$50 a ton from this year’s benchmark
of $253 a ton on a basis price of $2,000 a ton, the bank said.  Mining companies, including  Teck Resources Ltd. , and
smelters, such as Korea Zinc Co. and Mitsui Mining & Smelting
Co., are negotiating fees for next year. Producers seek lower
fees when raw material, or so-called concentrate, is in short
supply. Zinc is used to galvanize  steel .  The current differential between spot and benchmark
terms is about $125 to $145 a ton, the bank said. The
benchmark fees “will fall sharply in 2011, given the current
differential between spot and benchmark terms,” it said.  Treatment charges are the fees paid by miners to
smelters for processing concentrates to produce metal and are
payable per dry metric ton of zinc concentrate processed.  Miners normally pay a premium above spot market terms to
secure reliable customers for their concentrate. The “three-
digit differential would be very generous,” the bank said.  Escalator Cut  Zinc for three-month delivery advanced 0.8 percent to
$2,293.50 a ton on the London Metal Exchange at 4:56 p.m.
Tokyo time. Refined zinc production gained to 1.1 million
tons in October, exceeding demand of 1.036 million tons, the
International Lead and Zinc Study Group said Dec. 15. Output
in September was 1.095 million tons against demand of 1.07
million tons, according to the report.  The fees also have “price participation” clauses
allowing smelters to benefit from rising prices. An escalator
is a percentage increase in the base treatment charge for
each dollar gain in the LME zinc price above the basis price.  Mining companies may push for a further cut in so-called
escalators and de-escalators with the 2011 benchmark, the
bank said. This year’s price participation was already
reduced to the narrowest range in at least 20 years, it said.  -- With assistance from  Chanyaporn Chanjaroen  in Singapore.
