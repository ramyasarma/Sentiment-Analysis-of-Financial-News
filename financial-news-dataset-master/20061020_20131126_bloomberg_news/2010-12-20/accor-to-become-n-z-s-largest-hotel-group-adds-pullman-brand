Accor SA , Europe’s largest lodging
company, will become New Zealand’s biggest hotel operator after
adding two properties and announcing plans for two more.  Accor will take over Auckland’s  Hyatt Regency  hotel from
Jan. 20 and brand it as a five-star Pullman hotel, the Paris-
based company said in a statement today. The site will have 267
rooms, suites and apartments, it said. Accor has already taken
over Hotel So in Christchurch, on New Zealand’s South Island,
which will be managed under the All Seasons economy brand.  The two properties increase Accor’s New Zealand business to
29 hotels. It plans to open Novotel and Formule 1 hotels at
Auckland Airport next year, making it the country’s largest
hotel group, according to the statement.  Accor has more than 4,100 hotels in 90 countries, including
400 properties in the Asia Pacific region. The company’s brands
also include Sofitel, Novotel, Mercure and ibis.  The Hyatt Regency Auckland hotel sold for between NZ$50
million ($37 million) and NZ$60 million to an international
investor who requested confidentiality, the New Zealand Herald
reported on Nov. 24.  To contact the reporter for this story:
