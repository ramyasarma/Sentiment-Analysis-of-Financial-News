MetLife Inc. , the biggest U.S. life
insurer, changed its compensation guidelines to spare top
executives from pay comparison with their counterparts at  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  The compensation committee will exclude Berkshire when
determining how many shares to award its managers, New York-
based MetLife said Dec. 17 in a regulatory filing. MetLife said
the change was made after the Standard & Poor’s Insurance Index,
which the company uses to help determine appropriate pay, added
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire. Morningstar Inc.’s Footnoted
reported the exclusion earlier today.  MetLife Chief Executive Officer  Robert Henrikson , 63, had
$11.6 million in total compensation last year and $22.5 million
in 2008, according to MetLife’s proxy filing in March. Buffett,
Berkshire’s 80-year-old CEO, had total compensation of $175,000
in each of the last two years. Berkshire, which owns energy,
railroad and luxury units, generated  49 percent to 61 percent  of
its profit from insurance businesses in the past five years.  “Given the size of BHI, and the diversity of its business
outside of insurance and financial services, the Compensation
Committee concluded it is appropriate to exclude BHI from the
Insurance Index Comparators for future awards in order to yield
an appropriate peer comparison,” MetLife said in the filing.  Berkshire Chief Financial Officer  Marc Hamburg  was the
highest paid executive listed on the firm’s proxy last year with
compensation of $874,750. MetLife reported 2009 compensation of
more than $3 million for at least six managers.  Christopher Breslin , a spokesman for MetLife, declined to
comment.  Berkshire’s Class B shares were added to the S&P 500 Index
in February after Buffett split the stock and completed his
$26.5 billion acquisition of railroad Burlington Northern Santa
Fe. Berkshire has a  31 percent  weighting in the S&P 500
Insurance Index, according to Bloomberg data. MetLife has a
weighting of 9.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
