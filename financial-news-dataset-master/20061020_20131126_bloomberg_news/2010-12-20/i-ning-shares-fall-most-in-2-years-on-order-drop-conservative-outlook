Li Ning Co.  plunged the most in more
than two years in Hong Kong trading after the Chinese sportswear
maker set up by a former Olympic gymnast of the same name said
orders declined.  Li Ning  fell 10 percent to HK$19.12 as of 10:39 a.m. on the
city’s stock exchange, headed for the largest drop since
November 2008. The stock has lost 35 percent this year, compared
with a 3.4 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Orders for the second quarter of 2011 have fallen, and
operating costs are rising, the Beijing-based company  said ,
citing the results of its trade fair. Order volumes of apparel
declined by more than 7 percent from a year earlier, and that
for footwear fell 8 percent, according to the statement issued
Dec. 17 after the market’s close.  “Forecasts for growth in the coming year had become more
conservative” for Li Ning’s distributors, Chief Executive
Officer  Zhang Zhiyong  said in the statement. “The retail
environment for the sporting goods industry this year is faced
with heavy pressure,” Zhang said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
