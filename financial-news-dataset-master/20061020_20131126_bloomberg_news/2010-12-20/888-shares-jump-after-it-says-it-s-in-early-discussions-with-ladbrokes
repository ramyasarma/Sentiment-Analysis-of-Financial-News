888 Holdings Plc  rose the most in at
least five years in London trading after saying it’s in the
“early stages” of discussions with  Ladbrokes Plc  about a
possible offer for the online gambling company.  888  climbed  18 percent, the most since the company started
selling shares to the public in September 2005. 888, which
supplies services to Harrah’s Entertainment Inc. said there is
no certainty the talks will result in a formal offer being made,
according to a statement released on the Regulatory News Service
today.  Ladbrokes, the U.K. bookmaker founded in 1886, made a 240-
million-pound ($373 million) bid for 888, the Sunday Telegraph
reported. Ladbrokes bid 70 pence a share for the Internet casino
and poker group it tried to acquire four years ago, the
Telegraph said, without saying where it got the information.
Ladbrokes confirmed in its own statement it was in discussions,
without giving details.  “Strategically, the deal would give Ladbrokes significant
capabilities that it is currently lacking,” including
technology, gaming brands, access to European markets and a
broad affiliate network, Morgan Stanley analyst  Vaughan Lewis 
said in an e-mailed note to clients today. “We think such a
deal would be well received by the market.” Lewis recommends
the stock as ‘overweight.’  888 shares  climbed 8.75 pence to 57.75 pence at the 4:30
p.m. close after earlier rising as much as 11.75 pence. The
stock has dropped 48 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 199.5 million pounds.  Ladbrokes  fell 1.2 percent
to 126 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
