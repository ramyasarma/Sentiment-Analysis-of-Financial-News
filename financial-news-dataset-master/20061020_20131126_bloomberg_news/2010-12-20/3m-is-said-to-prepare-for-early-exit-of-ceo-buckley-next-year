3M Co.  directors are preparing for
the earlier-than-expected departure of  George Buckley  as chief
executive officer next year and have begun evaluating internal
candidates, said three people with knowledge of the matter.  Buckley, whose contract ends when he turns 65 in February
2012, has told board members and senior officers he would like
to resign next year, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. The board is focused
on 3M veterans, the people said. 3M may make  an announcement  in
early 2011 about Buckley’s plans, two of the people said.  “They have a deep bench, and there are a number of
attractive internal candidates,” said  Jason Feldman , a UBS AG
analyst in New York who recommends buying St. Paul, Minnesota-
based 3M.  Jacqueline Berry , 3M spokeswoman, said Buckley hasn’t told
directors and senior officers he would like to resign next year.  “Mr. Buckley has no intention of leaving the company
early,” Berry said. She declined to comment when asked whether
Buckley would retain his titles as CEO, chairman and president
until February 2012, or whether 3M has begun evaluating internal
candidates.  Buckley, who took over in 2005, is only the second CEO in
3M’s 108-year history to be recruited from outside the company,
a maker of thousands of products ranging from Post-It notes to
dental implants. The first was  James McNerney , who led 3M from
2001 until 2005 before becoming  Boeing Co. ’s CEO.  Possible Candidates?  The 3M executives being considered to take over are  Inge Thulin , 57, executive vice president of international
operations, and  Bradley Sauer , 51, executive vice president,
health care, two of the people said.  Jean Lobey , 58, executive vice president of the safety,
security and protection-services businesses, is a third
candidate the directors may consider, one person said.  Buckley, 63, steered 3M through the recession by slashing
about 6,400 jobs since the start of 2008, suspending merit pay
raises and freezing hiring. 3M has gained 13 percent since his
hiring was announced on Dec. 7, 2005, compared with a drop of
less than 1 percent for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index .  3M rose 97 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $87.34 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Grooming a Successor  Directors encouraged Buckley after his recruitment from
boat-maker  Brunswick Corp.  to groom executives who could take
over when he retired, said one of the people familiar with his
plans to step down.  Thulin, who grew up in Sweden, graduated from the
University of Gothenburg School of Business and joined 3M in
sales in 1979. He has worked in 3M’s operations around the
world. That may give him an edge over other executives being
considered for the CEO job, one of the people said.  3M wants to add $7 billion in  international sales  over the
next five years, split equally between developed and developing
markets, Thulin said in an interview with Bloomberg in Milan in
May. Last year, 63 percent of the 3M’s $23.1 billion in revenue
came from outside the U.S. Non-U.S. sales could account for as
much as 80 percent by 2015, Thulin said in the interview.  Sauer, who has an engineering degree from the University of
Minnesota, joined 3M in 1981, left to work at spinoff Imation
Corp. in 1996 and 1997 and then returned. Naming Sauer as CEO
would suggest heightened interest in health care at 3M, which
has signaled to advisers and bankers a desire to consider more
acquisitions in that industry, one of the people said.  Lobey, who was born in Algeria and educated in Paris, is a
34-year company veteran. He held marketing and management jobs
in Europe and Brazil before his current assignment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
