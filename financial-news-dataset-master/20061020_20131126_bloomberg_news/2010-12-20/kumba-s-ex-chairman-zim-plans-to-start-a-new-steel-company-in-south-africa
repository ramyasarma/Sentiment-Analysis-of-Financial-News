Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. ’s former
chairman  Lazarus Zim , who quit last week because of a conflict
of interest, will set up a steel company in South Africa.  “We are creating a totally new steel company,” Zim, who
chaired the  Anglo American Plc.  unit for more than four years,
said by mobile phone today. With Kumba a possible supplier to
the new company, “I had to clear any potential conflict.”  Details of the steel company will be released “early” in
the new year, he said, declining to identify his partners.  Zim had already excluded himself from board decisions over
Kumba’s Sishen deposit because of his relationship with  Jagdish Parekh . Kumba, based in Pretoria, is disputing the South African
government’s award of prospecting rights over the deposit to
Imperial Crown Trading, whose biggest shareholder is Parekh.  In August, Kumba said in an affidavit submitted to South
Africa’s High Court that an application by Imperial for a stake
in the rights to Sishen was “fraudulent.” The rights became
available after Kumba customer  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. 
failed to renew them by a May 2009 deadline. They then reverted
to the government before 21.4 percent were granted to Imperial.  Kumba said in March a nine-year supply deal from Sishen to
ArcelorMittal at 3 percent above production costs ended after
the steelmaker missed the deadline to renew its mineral rights.
ArcelorMittal said the decision could force it to close its
Saldanha mill, halt exports and fire as many as 4,000 workers.  Anglo owns 63 percent of Kumba.  To contact the reporters on this story:
