Natural gas futures rose for a
second day in New York on forecasts of below-normal temperatures
in the eastern U.S. that may increase demand for the fuel.  Gas futures gained 4.2 percent as weather may be colder
than normal on the East Coast and in the Great Lakes region from
Dec. 27 through Jan. 2, according to  the National Weather
Service . Earlier forecasts had showed above-normal temperatures
in New England during that period.  “It looks like we’re going to have another bout of cold,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker with Tradition Energy
in Stamford, Connecticut. “I think the market has found support
at $4 after last week’s flush and seems to be bouncing back a
little bit.”  Natural gas for January delivery rose 17.1 cents to settle
at $4.237 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The futures have declined 24 percent this
year.  The low temperature in New York on Dec. 27 may be 26
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 Celsius), 3 degrees below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.
The low temperature in Chicago may be 15 degrees Fahrenheit, 4
degrees below normal.  “Next week has been trended colder across most of the East
today with more widespread, much-below-normal temperatures
expected,” said  Stephen Strum , the president of Frontier
Weather in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in a note to clients today.  Higher Heating Demand  Heating demand in the U.S. may be 18 percent above normal
from Dec. 26 through Dec. 30, according to Weather Derivatives
in Belton, Missouri.  There may be storms on “both Christmas and then New
Year’s” in the East Coast, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas also rose on speculation a recovering U.S. economy will
boost industrial demand.  Data scheduled for release on Dec. 22 will probably show
the U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.8 percent in the third
quarter, up from a previous estimate of 2.5 percent, according
to a Bloomberg survey of 61 analysts.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials
gained 1.1 percent to 324.22.  Inventory Decline  The Energy Department reported last week that 164 billion
cubic feet of gas was withdrawn from  inventories  for the week
ended Dec. 10, above the five-year average decline of 153
billion. Stockpiles total 3.561 trillion cubic feet, 1 percent
below last year’s level and 9.9 percent above the five-year
average.  Gas stockpiles will reach 1.833 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, about 171 billion
cubic feet higher than at the end of March 2010, the Energy
Department said on Dec. 7 in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook  report.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, gained 11.23 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $4.1053 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
224,450 as of 2:39 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 285,000. Volume was 302,526 on Dec. 17. Open interest was
787,982 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
789,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
