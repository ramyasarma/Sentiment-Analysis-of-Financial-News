Saab Automobile  will work with China
Automobile Trading Co. Ltd. starting next year to distribute its
cars, including the 9-5 sedan and 9-4X crossover, in the world’s
largest automobile market.  The two have reached an agreement for Saab to return to
China in July, the Trollhaettan, Sweden-based carmaker said in a
statement today. Returning to China is part of Saab’s plan to
return to profit and sell 120,000 cars globally by 2012.  General Motors Co ., which sold the Swedish carmaker to
Spyker in February, halted its imports of the Swedish brand into
China and Russia in 2008 during the economic crisis. Saab plans
for Chinese sales between 2,000 and 5,000 cars a year initially,
and aims to add local production to increase deliveries to
50,000, the carmaker said in October.  “Long-term we have plans to make cars in China,”
spokesman  Eric Geers  said today by phone. “First we must get
volumes up there, we must have dealers and see demand rise.”  Spyker  surged  as much as 1.07 euros, or 33 percent, to 4.25
euros, the biggest intraday jump since Sept. 27, and traded at
that level as of 2:58 p.m. in Amsterdam trading.  Saab will initially have around 10 dealers in China, it
said. It aims to complete the agreement with China Automobile
Trading Co. in the first quarter.  China Automobile Trading Co., a state-owned company formed
in 1993, has imported and sold more than 100,000 cars, including
from  Volkswagen AG , Chrysler Group LLC and  Ford Motor Co .,
according to the  Chinese-language version  of its website. Saab
sold 860 cars in China in 2008.  Saab said in October it was talking to a number of
potential partners, including  Beijing Automotive Industry
Holding Co ., which last December bought technologies from Saab
for about $200 million.  -- Ola Kinnander ,  Tian Ying . Editors:  Chad Thomas ,  Kenneth Wong .  To contact the reporters on this story:
