The Budapest city council wants to
negotiate an agreement with  Alstom SA , the world’s second-
largest trainmaker by revenue, over a 65 billion forint ($314
million) contract to supply subway cars.  The council is opting for the talks because litigation
would be more expensive, Mayor  Istvan Tarlos  said on state-run
M1 television today.  “If we didn’t agree it would cost a great deal for the
city,” Tarlos said.  Alstom failed to obtain a regulatory permit for the
vehicles, risking its contract, the news website Index reported
on July 30. The cars didn’t meet requirements for the quality of
braking systems and the control software needed modification,
according to the Budapest-based website.  The Levallois-Perret, France-based company won the contract
for 44 new air-conditioned, 100-meter (328 feet) subway trains
in 2006 over a bid by OAO Metrowagonmash of Russia. Budapest
plans to use the trains for a new subway line and a
reconstructed one.  To contact the reporter on this story:
