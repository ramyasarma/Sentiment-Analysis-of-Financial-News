Oil rose on speculation U.S.
economic growth will accelerate next year, bolstering demand in
the world’s biggest oil-consuming country.  Futures climbed 0.9 percent before the release of data this
week that may show U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a
faster pace than estimated earlier. Gasoline futures advanced as
a fuel-making unit serving the U.S. East Coast market remained
shut for repairs.  “We’re seeing U.S. economic optimism creep into the price
of oil,” said  Phil Flynn , a Chicago-based analyst and trader
with investment adviser PFGBest. “The economic data has been
good and we’re getting evidence that the overall economy is
taking off a little bit.”  Crude oil for January delivery increased 79 cents to settle
at $88.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. January
futures expired today. The more-active February contract rose 77
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $89.37 a barrel.  Gasoline surged 6 cents, or 2.6 percent, to end the session
at $2.3778 a gallon in New York. It was the highest settlement
since May 3.  Recent U.S. economic data “bodes well” for 2011, Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said on CNBC
television today.  “If we can get that going, I think the economy can build
some momentum and we’ll be able to bring unemployment down,” he
said. “But it is going to be a slow process. We have to walk
before we can run.”  Economic Growth  Data scheduled for release by the Commerce Department on
Dec. 22 will probably show U.S. GDP grew 2.8 percent in the
third quarter, up from an estimate of 2.5 percent last month,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 61 analysts.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  chief U.S. economist  Jan Hatzius 
increased his 2011 GDP forecast to 3.4 percent from 2 percent
last month to take account of the two-year extension of the
Bush-era tax cuts and a spate of stronger-than-expected economic
statistics.  “Everyone is expecting a move up in the oil market,”
 Roland Stenzel , a crude-oil trader at E&T Energie
Handelsgesellschaft mbH, said from Vienna. “Technically it’s
looking strong, fundamentally it’s looking strong.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.3 percent to
1,247.48 at 3:10 p.m. in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  was little changed at 11,486.38.  Refinery Repairs  Gasoline gained strength as Hovensa LLC worked to repair
the 150,000-barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker at its St.
Croix refinery, the largest in the Caribbean. The plant supplied
139,000 barrels a day of finished gasoline and blending
components to the East Coast in September, including New York
Harbor, the delivery point for the Nymex gasoline contract.  “Gasoline is showing strength because of tightness in the
New York Harbor,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas
Commodity Futures Inc. in New York.  An Energy Department report on Dec. 22 will probably show
that U.S. crude-oil  stockpiles  dropped 3.5 million barrels last
week, according to the median of seven analyst  estimates  in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The oil market is “well balanced,” and current prices are
at a “good” level, Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines
 Youcef Yousfi  said in an interview. Algeria, an OPEC member,
produced 1.25 million barrels of crude a day in November,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
accounts for 40 percent of global supply, maintained output
quotas of 24.845 million barrels a day for 11 of its members at
a meeting in Quito, Ecuador, on Dec. 11.  Price Outlook  Oil prices may increase next year on heightened demand that
has eroded excess global crude inventories, according to the
 Centre for Global Energy Studies . Prices will be strongly
influenced by OPEC’S response to rising consumption, CGES said.
The center forecasts oil demand will climb 1.6 percent in 2011,
compared with a 3 percent gain this year.  Brent crude oil for February settlement climbed $1.07, or
1.2 percent, to $92.74 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. It was the highest settlement price since Oct.
1, 2008.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 509,555 contracts as of 3:09
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 650,488
contracts on Dec. 17, 4.2 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.35 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
