Boeing Co.  plans to boost output of
the 777 jet 66 percent by 2013, a move that will add revenue as
the planemaker prepares to announce a seventh delay to its 787
Dreamliner.  Production of the 777s will rise to 8.3 aircraft per month
in the first quarter of 2013, the Chicago-based company said
today in a statement. In March, Boeing said the manufacturing
rate would rise starting in mid-2011 to seven planes a month
from five now.  The increase is “a significant endorsement of global
demand, especially from developing economies,”  Peter Arment , an
analyst with Gleacher & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut, wrote
today. He increased his earnings estimates for 2013 and 2014.  Boeing, which gets the majority of its revenue upon
delivery of new jets, is increasing production for the twin-
aisle 777 and the 737 single-aisle jet as demand recovers after
the recession. Deliveries of those planes are providing Boeing’s
main income stream as delays mount on the Dreamliner, now about
three years behind schedule amid parts shortages, manufacturing
mistakes and redesigns.  The Dreamliner’s seventh setback may be more than six
months because of fresh problems, including last month’s
electrical fire during a test flight, the Seattle Times reported
today, citing unidentified people who work on or are familiar
with Boeing’s new jet program.  Long-Haul Routes  The systems failures brought to light by the fire added to
concerns related to the Rolls-Royce Group Plc engines used on
some of the planes. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
warned the company that certification for long-haul routes may
be in jeopardy, the Seattle Times reported.  In addition, Boeing is struggling with continued
manufacturing problems including heavy condensation inside the
787s that have already been built and are being stored outside
the factory in Everett, Washington, the newspaper said.  The newspaper cited  Scott Fancher , the head of the 787
program, as saying the company has “a tough job in front of
us.” Boeing said Nov. 24 that it would announce its revised
schedule for first delivery in a few weeks. The latest plan
targeted the middle of the first quarter of 2011 for delivery to
Japan’s All Nippon Airways Co.  777 Backlog  “There is no doubt we have a lot of work ahead of us,”
said  Yvonne Leach , a spokeswoman for Boeing. “What we’ve
learned is being applied daily by our teams and in the planning
for going forward.” The company expects “in coming weeks” to
release a new timetable “that will accommodate the known issues
and discoveries on the program -- including the work backlog
that exists in the factory,” Leach said.  Gleacher’s Arment wrote in the note that the 787 design is
sound and certification will slide by four to six months.  Boeing  fell  $1.88 to $63.15 at 2:03 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The stock had gained 20 percent this
year before today.  The 777 is offered in a variety of configurations and seats
more than 400. The average list price is about $258.2 million.
Boeing has delivered 907 of the 777 aircraft since it entered
service in 1995 and has an order backlog for more than 260
planes.  Boeing said in October that it was considering increasing
production on the 737, the world’s most widely flown jetliner,
to 40 a month from 31.5.  The twin-engine 737 aircraft rivals the A320 built by
larger rival Airbus SAS. Airbus in the past month announced
plans to offer new engines for the A320.  To contact the reporters on this story:
