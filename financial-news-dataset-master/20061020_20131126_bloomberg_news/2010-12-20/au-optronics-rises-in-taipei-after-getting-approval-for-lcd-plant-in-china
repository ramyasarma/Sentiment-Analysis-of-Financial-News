AU Optronics Corp. rose in Taipei
trading after Taiwan’s second-largest flat panel company won
approval to build a $3 billion liquid-crystal display plant in
China.  The stock gained 1 percent to NT$31.30 as of 9:01 a.m. The
company plans to build a so-called 7.5-generation facility in
the Chinese city of Kunshan at eastern Jiangsu province and will
need to obtain China’s approval before it can set up the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
