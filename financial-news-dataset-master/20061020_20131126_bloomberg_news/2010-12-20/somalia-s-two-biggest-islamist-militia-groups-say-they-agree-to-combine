Somalia ’s two biggest Islamist
militias, al-Shabaab, which the U.S. accuses of having links to
al-Qaeda, and Hisbul Islam, have combined according to the
smaller of the groups.  “From late yesterday Hisbul Islam is fully amalgamated
with al-Shabaab,” Mohamed Osman Arus, a spokesman for Hisbul
Islam, said in a phone interview today. “We have been in
discussions for a while but we have joined forces with our
brothers.”  The union will strengthen the groups in their escalating
fight against government and African Union forces, whom they
have been battling in the capital, Mogadishu, said Ali Sheikh
Abdi, a Somali political analyst.  The force of 6,100 African peacekeepers has been unable to
re-establish government control over the Horn of Africa country,
which has been without functioning central administration since
1991, when ruler  Mohamed Siad Barre  was ousted. Al-Shabaab began
its insurgency in 2007 and has proven to be the strongest threat
to the central government since then.  To contact the reporters on this story:
