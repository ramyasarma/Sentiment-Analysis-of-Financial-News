SK Energy Co. , South Korea’s largest
oil processor, said an explosion that left one person dead
hasn’t affected operations at its refining unit in Ulsan.  A sub contractor died and six people were hospitalized
after the explosion in the morning, Chung Tae Hoon, a spokesman
at Seoul-based SK Energy said by phone.  The company is investigating the cause of the explosion at
the heavy oil upgrading unit at its Ulsan plant in the southeast
of the country, Chung said. Yonhap News earlier reported a gas
leak during maintenance caused the accident.  The heavy oil upgrading unit can process 45,000 barrels a
day, according to SK Energy’s earnings statement released in
October. SK Energy has capacity to refine 1.1 million barrels of
crude a day.  A fire was extinguished soon after the explosion occurred
around 9 a.m. Seoul time today, Chung said.  SK Energy  rose 0.6 percent to 178,000 won as of 2:40 p.m.
in Seoul trading, compared with a 0.6 percent drop in the
benchmark Kospi index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
