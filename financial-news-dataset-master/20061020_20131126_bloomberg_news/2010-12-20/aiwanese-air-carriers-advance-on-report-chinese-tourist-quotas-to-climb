China Airlines Ltd.  paced gains by
carriers and hotel companies in Taipei stock trading after the
 Economic Daily News  said the government may raise the daily
limit for Chinese tourist arrivals.  China Airlines, the island’s largest carrier, climbed 2.1
percent to NT$24.85 as of 11:37 a.m. local time, the most this
month.  EVA Airways Corp.  , the second biggest, advanced 3
percent to a record NT$36.10.  Formosa International Hotels Corp. ,
the largest hotel operator, gained 1.1 percent to NT$540, set
for the highest close since Oct. 6. The Taiex index fell 0.9
percent to 8,740.30.  The government may allow 4,000 mainland Chinese to arrive a
day from the current 3,000 as early as Jan. 1, the Taipei-based,
Chinese-language newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  Liu Te-shun , vice-chairman of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council,
didn’t answer two calls to his office.  “The news on Chinese tourist quotas is boosting
expectations of more direct flights,” said  Daniel Tzeng , an
analyst at Fubon Securities Co. “Direct flights provide high
margins for these airlines.”  The report comes as a delegation led by China’s top
negotiator on cross-strait affairs  Chen Yunlin  arrived in Taiwan
today for a new round of talks. China and Taiwan are expected to
reach an agreement on health-care cooperation, Xinhua News
Agency reported today.  Mainland visitors are likely to be Taiwan’s biggest source
of arrivals for the first time this year, surpassing the 1
million projected for travelers from Japan, Chang Shi-chung,
chief secretary at the Tourism Bureau, said Nov. 23. Foreign
tourist numbers may climb to 6 million next year from 5.4
million this year, the Cabinet said Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
