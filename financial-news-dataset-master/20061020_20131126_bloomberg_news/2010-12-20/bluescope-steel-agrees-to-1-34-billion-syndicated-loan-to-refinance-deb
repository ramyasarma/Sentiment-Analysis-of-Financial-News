BlueScope Steel Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest steelmaker, agreed to A$1.35 billion ($1.34 billion) of
three- and five-year syndicated loans to refinance debt.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd. and Westpac
Banking Corp. arranged the debt, which was provided by 13 banks,
according to a filing to the Australian stock exchange. The
facility is equally split between 2013 and 2015 maturities, and
will refinance A$1.275 billion of loans due in 2011 and 2012,
according to the filing.  Bluescope, based in Melbourne, is forecasting a “small”
net loss after tax for the half ending Dec. 31, joining the
world’s biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal in predicting lower
earnings as raw material costs surge.  Bluescope’s  shares  rose 1.8 percent to A$2.32 at 10:06 a.m.
in Sydney, paring their losses this year to 25 percent. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index has declined 2.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
