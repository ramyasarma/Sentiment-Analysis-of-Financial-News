Paladin Energy Ltd. , the Australian
mining company producing uranium in Africa, said output at the
Canadian assets it agreed to acquire last week for C$260.9
million ($258 million) may begin as early as 2017.  Paladin is targeting deposits in the Central Mineral Belt
of eastern Canada that may increase to more than 200 million
pounds of uranium oxide,  John Borshoff , chief executive officer
of the Perth-based company, said in a phone interview today.
 Fronteer Gold Inc.  will receive 52.1 million Paladin shares in
exchange for the uranium assets, the companies said Dec. 17.  Paladin, which operates the Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia
and the Kayelekera project in Malawi, forecasts increasing
uranium demand as countries such as China expand the use of
nuclear power to curb emissions from burning coal. Paladin aims
to double uranium oxide output to almost 14 million pounds by
2016 from 7 million pounds in the year ending in June 2011.  Paladin may consider more acquisitions, Borshoff said,
declining to be specific. “We’ve got an active M&A team,” he
said. “People come to us because they haven’t got the expertise
or appetite to develop a mine with complex attributes.”  Paladin  advanced 2.4 percent to A$5.03 by the market’s 4:10
p.m. close in Sydney, the biggest gain in almost four weeks,
compared with a decline of 0.6 percent for the benchmark  S&P/ASX
200 Index . Paladin has climbed 20 percent in 2010, while the
index has dropped 2.5 percent.  Paladin also seeks to convert a preliminary accord with
China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Co. into a binding agreement
in early 2011, potentially for “long-term” uranium shipments
to the country’s second-biggest builder of nuclear power plants,
Borshoff said today. The companies in August said that they
would pursue potential fuel sales and partnerships.  Rosatom Corp., Russia’s nuclear holding company, agreed to
buy  Mantra Resources Ltd.  for A$1.16 billion, gaining the Mkuju
River uranium project in Tanzania, the companies said last week.
 Extract Resources Ltd. , an explorer listed in Australia, is
developing a uranium mine in Namibia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
