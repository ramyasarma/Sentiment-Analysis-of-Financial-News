Copper rose the most in a week in
New York amid speculation that the U.S. economy is recovering
and after hedge funds increased bets the metal will gain.  The U.S. Commerce Department on Dec. 22 may revise its
estimate for third-quarter growth to an annualized 2.8 percent,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists, up from a
previous estimate of 2.5 percent. Hedge funds have the biggest
net-long position, or bets on higher New York prices, in five
years, government data show.  “The market is just firm going into year-end,” said
 David Thurtell , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London. “Hedge
funds want to keep them high in order to have good performance
figures and they probably also anticipate good New Year
inflows.”  Copper futures for delivery in March added 4.7 cents, or
1.1 percent, to close at $4.206 a pound at 1:01 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. That’s the biggest one-day gain for a most-
active contract since Dec. 13. The metal has surged 46 percent
since July 1, partly on demand from emerging markets.  Speculative long positions, or bets copper prices will
rise, outnumbered short positions by 30,268 contracts on the
Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange in the week
ended Dec. 14, the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said on Dec. 17. That was the highest net-long since
March 2005.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $131, or 1.4 percent, to $9,201 a metric ton
($4.17 a pound).  Tin, aluminum, zinc and lead also gained in London. Nickel
fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
