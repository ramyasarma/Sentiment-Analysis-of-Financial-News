Copper from London to Shanghai rose
for a second day, nearing an all-time high, on speculation that
further signs of an improvement in the U.S. economy will boost
the outlook for demand for the metal used in pipes and wires.
Aluminum and zinc also advanced.  Copper for three-month delivery advanced as much as 2.1
percent to $9,257.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
$10 less than the record, which was set Dec. 14. The contract
was at $9,171 at 3:01 p.m. in Singapore, 1.1 percent higher.
Three-month zinc rose 0.6 percent to $2,288 a ton.  The U.S. economy is picking up speed and may grow 3 percent
to 3.5 percent next year, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said last week. A Bloomberg News survey showed third-
quarter growth might be revised to an annualized 2.8 percent,
compared with an earlier Commerce Department estimate of 2.5
percent. The department will publish revised data on Dec. 22.  “There is a series of data showing an improving U.S.
economic outlook, and that fuels the commodities markets,” HNA
Topwin Futures Co. said in a research report today. The U.S. is
the largest user of copper after China.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the U.S. outlook for the
next three to six months rose 1.1 percent, the most in eight
months, after a revised 0.4 percent gain in October, the New
York-based group said on Dec. 17. The reading matched the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The U.S. economy unquestionably has some momentum,”
Greenspan said in a Dec. 16 interview in Washington. “The
fourth quarter looks good. The growth rate could be 3.5 percent
or more” for the final three months of this year.  Household Spending  Separate reports this week may show an increase in U.S.
consumer and business expenditure. Household purchases rose 0.5
percent last month after a 0.4 percent gain in October,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before Dec. 23 figures from the Commerce
Department. The same day, the agency may show demand for durable
goods excluding cars and aircraft climbed 2 percent.  A so-called dominant position, indicated in a Warrant Cash
Banding Report from the LME, showed one holder held 50 percent
to 79 percent of copper stockpiles and open positions for the
next three trading days as of Dec. 15. At least 90 percent had
been held by the company on Dec. 10, according to the bourse.  “The majority of LME’s stockpiles being held by one single
company has created an artificially tight physical market,”
 Wang Ning , an analyst at Xiangyu Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai. “This has given copper a boost while supply-and-
demand news is relatively quiet.”  Potache Accident  In Chile, three workers were killed after a shiploader
collapsed at Potache port, according to Collahuasi, the world’s
third-largest copper mine. The accident occurred after a ship
left port, Bernardita Fernandez, a spokeswoman, said yesterday.  “The mine is operating,” Fernandez said by phone. “If
Collahuasi needs a place to ship copper during this period, it
will find one.” Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc each own 44
percent of the mine.  Copper traded on the Comex in New York gained as much as
1.6 percent to $4.2235 a pound, and traded at $4.1885. On the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, copper for March delivery closed 0.3
percent higher at 68,640 yuan ($10,283) a ton.  Aluminum in London climbed 0.6 percent to $2,349 a ton, and
lead rose 0.2 percent to $2,425 a ton. Nickel lost 0.5 percent
to $24,875, while tin increased 0.4 percent to $24,150.  -- Helen Sun , with assistance from  Matt Craze  in Santiago.
