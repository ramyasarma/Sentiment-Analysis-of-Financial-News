AccessKenya Group Ltd. , the
country’s only publicly traded Internet company, fell for a
second day after saying it expects 2010 profit to fall by at
least 25 percent from last year.  The stock dropped 25 cents, or 4.1 percent, to 13 shillings
at 11:03 a.m. in Nairobi. A close at this level would be the
weakest since June 28, 2007. The shares have fallen for 11 days,
the longest streak of declines since March 2009.  Net income will retreat because of depreciation and
foreign-exchange losses, the company said in a statement to the
Nairobi Stock Exchange on Dec. 17.  “What concerns investors is that competition is kicking in
and it will be the second year they are reporting a decline in
earnings,”  Eric Musau , a research analyst at African Alliance
Kenya Securities Ltd., said in a phone interview in Nairobi
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
