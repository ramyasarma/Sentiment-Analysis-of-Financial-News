Mauritius’s currency depreciated and
headed for the lowest in a week to the dollar as the Indian
Ocean island nation’s central bank buys dollars that the
government’s trading unit will use to pay for imports.  The rupee weakened 2.1 percent to 30.55 per dollar by 1:02
p.m. in Port Louis, the capital. A close at this level would be
the weakest since Dec. 13.  “One possible reason is that Bank of Mauritius is buying
dollars to pay for State Trading Corp. imports, which explains
more demand for the currency,” Imrith Ramtohul, head of
investment at  Mauritius Union Assurance Co. , said in a phone
interview from Port Louis. He also heads the company’s foreign-
exchange investment portfolio.  The State Trading Corp. imports petroleum products, cement,
rice, wheat flour and liquefied petroleum gas, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
