Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s
largest carmaker, raised its 2010 vehicle sales forecast for
China, saying new models may help boost deliveries in the
country to more than 700,000 units.  Hyundai, which in November forecast full-year sales of
about 690,000 vehicles in the world’s largest auto market, will
introduce its latest Sonata midsize sedan in the country early
next year to tap growing demand,  Noh Jae-man , president of the
company’s Chinese venture, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Seoul-based carmaker’s sales in China increased this
year from last year’s 570,000 vehicles after new models
including Verna compact cars and ix35 sport-utility vehicles
lured buyers, according to the statement. The company is
constructing a third plant in China to boost annual capacity by
400,000 vehicles to 1 million.  Hyundai said in October it plans to form a 500 billion won
($430 million) venture with  Ziyang Nanjun Automobile Co.  next
year to enter China’s commercial vehicle market.  The venture will take over Ziyang’s commercial-vehicle
operation, which has annual output capacity of 120,000 units. It
will target sales of 90,000 heavy trucks and buses in China next
year, rising to 300,000 in 2015, Hyundai said at the time.  Kia Motors Corp. , Hyundai’s affiliate, also plans to start
sales of its midsize K5 sedans in China in the first half, the
company said in a separate e-mailed statement today.  Hyundai  gained 0.8 percent to 179,500 won as of 1:25 p.m.
in Seoul trading, while Kia Motors declined 0.4 percent to
50,100 won. The benchmark Kospi index fell 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
