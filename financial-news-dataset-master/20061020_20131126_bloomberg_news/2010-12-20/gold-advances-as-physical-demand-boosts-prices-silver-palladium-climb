Gold rose as two weeks of declines
attracted buying from physical users and investors, with
holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the metal gaining
to an all-time high. Silver also increased.  Immediate-delivery bullion gained 0.8 percent to $1,386.30
an ounce at 3:33 p.m. in Singapore. The price lost 0.8 percent
last week following a 2 percent drop the week before. The
February-delivery contract rose 0.5 percent to $1,385.80 an
ounce on the Comex in New York.  “Physical demand has put a floor” under prices,  Chen Xin Yi , an analyst at Barclays Capital in Singapore, said by phone
today. “Buyers realized that prices are not going to correct
very much. Investors’ demand is also stable.”  Gold assets in exchange-traded products, or ETPs, climbed
0.7 percent to a record  2,113.2  metric tons as of Dec. 17,
according to data collected by Bloomberg from 10 providers.
Holdings have climbed 17.6 percent this year.  The metal has gained 26 percent this year, set for a 10th
annual gain, as a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and so-called
quantitative easing in the U.S. hurt currencies and aided demand.
The price reached a record $1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7.  Gold may also be boosted by developments on the Korean
peninsula and the euro-zone debt crisis,  Ben Westmore , an
analyst at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne, said today
by phone. South Korea proceeded with a live-firing drill that
has promoted North Korean threats of retaliation as the United
Nations’ Security Council failed to ease tension between the two.  Commission Data  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators cut their
net-long position in New York futures 5 percent to  220,195 
contracts in the week to Dec. 14, according to the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That’s the lowest
level since the week ended Aug. 17.  Baker Steel Capital Managers LLP, a London-based firm
managing about $1.7 billion, plans a new gold fund to be backed
by the metal and shares of producers worldwide, according to
Managing Partner  David Baker . The firm’s existing Baker Steel
Gold Fund climbed 44 percent in the first 11 months.  “Gold isn’t in a bubble,” said Sydney-based Baker, who
founded Baker Steel Capital in 2001. “We’re not finding enough
to grow supply. We’re having to go to more marginal projects and
third-world countries where there are more risks.”  Investors speculated today European nations will struggle
to raise funds to plug holes from sovereign debts, driving the
euro lower against the dollar. Moody’s Investors Service last
week cut Ireland’s credit rating and said it may lower Spain’s.  Silver for immediate delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$29.3188 an ounce. Silver holdings in ETPs remained unchanged
for a second straight day at 15,172.49 tons as of Dec. 17.  Spot palladium added 0.4 percent to $742.50 and immediate-
delivery platinum increased 0.2 percent at $1,703.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
