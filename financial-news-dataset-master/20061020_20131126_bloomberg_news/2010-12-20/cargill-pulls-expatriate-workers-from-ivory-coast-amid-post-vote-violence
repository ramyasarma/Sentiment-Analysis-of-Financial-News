Cargill Inc. said it removed its
“small number” of expatriate employees from Ivory Coast, the
world’s largest cocoa producer, amid post-election violence.  “Our prime focus is ensuring that all our employees in the
country are safe,” Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for the
Minnetonka, Minnesota-based grain distributor, said in an e-mail
today. “We have temporarily removed our small number of
expatriates from the country and have put in place measures to
support the safety and security of our Ivorian employees.”  Cargill, the largest closely held U.S. company, has
operated in Ivory Coast since 1998, and is following the advice
of foreign governments and the United Nations, Eich said. The
company has operations to buy, handle and export cocoa beans in
Brazil, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Indonesia and Vietnam.  Ivory Coast President  Laurent Gbagbo  has refused to accept
defeat in the Nov. 28 run-off election. The Independent
Electoral Commission said challenger  Alassane Ouattara  won the
vote. The Constitutional Council declared Gbagbo the victor,
after rejecting vote tallies from some northern regions.  More than 50 people were killed and at least 200 injured in
three days of protests, mainly in Abidjan, the biggest city, and
Yamoussoukro, the capital, according to a statement yesterday
from United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  Navi Pillay . The UN doesn’t accept Gbagbo as the legitimate leader.  Eich didn’t say exactly how many expatriate employees are
in Ivory Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
