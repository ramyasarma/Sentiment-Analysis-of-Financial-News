South Port New Zealand Ltd. , which
operates the nation’s southernmost port, expects 2011 profit to
exceed an earlier forecast on higher cargo volumes and strong
demand for logs in China.  Net income for the year ending June 30, 2011, is likely to
exceed the NZ$3.5 million ($2.6 million) to NZ$3.9 million range
previously forecast, the Invercargill-based company said in a
statement sent to the stock exchange.  Total cargo volume increased 33 percent to 1.09 million
metric tons in the five months ended Nov. 30 amid strong Chinese
demand for logs and increased food imports, the company said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
