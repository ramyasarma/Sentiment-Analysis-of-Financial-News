Novartis AG , Europe’s third-largest
drug company by sales, signed a memorandum of understanding with
the city of St. Petersburg as part of a five-year, $500 million
investment in Russia.  Novartis will build a new plant in the country for the
production of branded generics as well as pharmaceuticals, the
Basel, Switzerland-based company said in a statement today.
Construction will start in 2011 and the plant will produce about
1.5 billion units per year, the company said.  “Novartis is making a strategic investment in Russia for
long-term growth,” Novartis Chief Executive Officer  Joseph Jimenez  said in the statement. The agreement “enables us to
expand our commercial presence in a key emerging market.”  Drugmakers such as Novartis are seeking growth in Russia as
part of a wider push in emerging markets, where sales are rising
faster than in developed countries. The Russian government has
pledged to improve health care in the country and develop a
local pharmaceutical industry, Novartis said.  The Swiss drugmaker said it plans to expand its research
and development and public-health collaborations with the
Russian government. As part of the project, Novartis may license
some of its own compounds to Russian companies or buy rights to
promising drug candidates from Russian scientists and
universities, the company said.  Novartis also pledged to double its investments in drug
development in clinical trials in Russia and expects to enroll
about 4,000 people in studies by 2013, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
