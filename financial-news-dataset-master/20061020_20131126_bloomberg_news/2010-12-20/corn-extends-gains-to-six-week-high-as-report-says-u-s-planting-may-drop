Corn climbed for a third day to a
six-week high on speculation planting in the U.S., the world’s
biggest grower and exporter, may decline next year amid rising
demand for ethanol use in the U.S. and stronger Chinese imports.  The March-delivery contract rose as much as 1.1 percent to
$6.03 a bushel, the highest level since Nov. 9 on the Chicago
Board of Trade, and was at $5.995 at 3 p.m. in Tokyo. The
contract gained 3.9 percent last week, the fourth straight
weekly advance.  U.S. farmers will plant corn on 90.755 million acres (36.7
million hectares), less than a November forecast of 93.055
million, according to Informa Economics Inc. Soybeans will be
sown on 77.565 million acres, down from a record 77.714 million
this year, the Memphis-based researcher said Dec. 17.  “Informa’s forecast pushed corn and soybeans higher for a
second day,” said  Han Sung Min , a broker at Korea Exchange Bank
Futures Co. in Seoul. Informa’s estimates came after the U.S.
Congress passed a bill that extends through 2011 a tax credit
for blending ethanol with gasoline and a tariff on imports of
the biofuel, he said.  Soybeans for March delivery advanced as much as 1.1 percent
to $13.25 a bushel, the highest price since Nov. 12, and last
traded at $13.16.  The Senate last week passed an $858 billion tax-cut plan
that would extend the 45-cent-a-gallon credit to refiners and a
54-cent tariff on Brazilian imports. The government incentives
were set to expire at the end of this month.  Biodiesel  output
ground to a near-halt after its $1-a-gallon tax incentive
expired last year.  Ethanol Use  U.S. ethanol makers may use as much as 5.1 billion bushels
of corn to produce the grain-based gasoline additive in
2010-2011, eroding crop inventories, Rabobank said Dec. 16 in a
report.  Drier weather in South America, especially Argentina,
caused by the La Nina weather event has also lent support to the
market, Korea Exchange Bank’s Han said. Brazil and Argentina are
the biggest exporters of corn and soybeans after the U.S.  At least 50 percent of corn and sunflower crops in
Argentina were too dry after less than 0.33 inches (0.8
centimeters) of rain during the weekend,  Mike Tannura , president
of T-Storm Weather, said yesterday in an e-mailed note. A heat
wave will affect Argentina for the majority of the next seven to
10 days, the note said.  Wheat for March delivery rose as much as 1.8 percent to
$7.705 a bushel and last traded at $7.6775. The price fell 2.4
percent last week.  U.S. farmers planted 39.502 million acres of winter wheat
this year, down from a November estimate of 39.687 million,
according to Informa Economics.  China’s wheat imports in 2010 may total 1.45 million metric
tons, about 500,000 tons more than a year ago, Grain.gov.cn, a
research unit under the China National Grain & Oils Information
Center, said in an e-mailed report. The forecast was based on
first 10 months of customs data, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
