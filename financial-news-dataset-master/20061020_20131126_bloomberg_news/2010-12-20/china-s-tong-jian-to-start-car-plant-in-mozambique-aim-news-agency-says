Mozambique’s government and China’s
Tong Jian Investment Ltd. signed a $200 million pact to set up a
vehicle assembly plant in Maputo province, the state-run Agencia
de Informacao de Mocambique reported, citing director-general of
the African country’s Office for Special Economic Zones Danilo
Nala.  The vehicle assembly plant will be operational from July
and 30 percent of the vehicles will be sold locally, the Maputo-
based news agency said.  The plant will create 3,000 jobs and produce 10,000
vehicles a year, before rising to as much as 50,000, AIM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
