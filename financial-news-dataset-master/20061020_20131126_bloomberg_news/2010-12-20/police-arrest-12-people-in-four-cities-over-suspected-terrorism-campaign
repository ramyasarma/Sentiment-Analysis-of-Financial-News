U.K. police arrested 12 men today on
suspicion of preparing a terrorist act in the country.  The suspects, aged 17 to 28, were arrested in or near
their homes in Cardiff, Stoke-on-Trent and London, except for
one found in Birmingham, the West Midlands police said in a
 press release  today. No detail was given on suspected offenses,
and no names were released.  “The operation is in its early stages so we are unable to
go into detail at this time about the suspected offences,”
Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner John Yates said in
the statement. “However, I believe it was necessary at this
time to take action in order to ensure public safety.”  The men were detained by unarmed officers at about 5 a.m.,
the release said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
