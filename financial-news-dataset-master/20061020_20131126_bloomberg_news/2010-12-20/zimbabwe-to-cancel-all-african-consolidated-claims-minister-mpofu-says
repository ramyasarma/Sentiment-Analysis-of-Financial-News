Zimbabwe will cancel all mineral
claims held by Maidstone, England-based  African Consolidated
Resources Plc , said Obert Mpofu, the country’s mines minister.  The licenses “will be revoked because there were
irregularities when they were issued,” Mpofu said in a phone
interview from the capital, Harare, today. “All of them were
acquired fraudulently.” He said the cancellation isn’t related
to President  Robert Mugabe ’s warning last week that U.K.
companies may face sanctions.  Mugabe said on Dec. 17 that it’s “time to read the riot
act” to the U.K. and other Western countries which have imposed
sanctions against the president and some other members of his
ruling party.  ACR has been involved in a dispute with the government over
its rights to the Marange diamond field. The company has been
active in Zimbabwe since 2004 and has interests in gold, nickel,
platinum and other commodities, according to its website.  Andrew Cranswick , chief executive officer of ACR, said the
company has done nothing wrong. “None of our claims, including
those in Marange, were improperly acquired,” he said in a phone
interview from the U.K. today. “We will do everything we can to
protect our rights.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
