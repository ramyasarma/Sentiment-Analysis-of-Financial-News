Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. , the insurer that repaid a $3.4 billion U.S. bailout this
year, agreed to sell a claims-administration business to
Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc. for $278 million.  The insurer expects to record an after-tax gain of about
$150 million on the sale of Specialty Risk Services LLC, which
is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011,
according to a Business Wire statement today from Hartford,
which is based in the Connecticut city of the same name.  Hartford, led by Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee  is
scaling back to replenish capital lost in 2008 and 2009 under
his predecessor,  Ramani Ayer . McGee, 56, has pared commercial-
mortgage holdings and limited sales of retirement products that
put the company at risk of losses when stock markets decline.  “The sale of SRS is consistent with our strategy to focus
the Hartford on core protection and wealth-management
businesses,” McGee said in the statement.  Credit Suisse Group AG was Hartford’s financial adviser.  To contact the reporters on this story:
