The National Basketball Association
completed its acquisition of the New Orleans Hornets, whose
owner  George Shinn  was forced to sell the franchise due to
financial troubles.  The NBA’s Board of Governors today approved an agreement
between Shinn and the league that allows the NBA to run the team
until a new owner can be found, the league said in an e-mailed
statement. The transaction makes the Hornets the NBA’s first
league-owned team.  Jac Sperling , a New Orleans native and founder of Grit Rock
Ventures LLC, an investment company based on the sports and
entertainment businesses, will be the team’s chairman and
governor, the release said. Sperling is also the vice chairman
of Minnesota Sports and Entertainment, the parent company of the
National Hockey League’s Minnesota Wild.  Shinn, 49, founded the Hornets in Charlotte, North
Carolina, in 1988 and moved them to New Orleans in 2002. The
Hornets opened the 2010 season 8-0 and are currently 16-11,
seven and a half games behind the San Antonio Spurs in the
Western Conference’s Southwest Division. Through 13 home games,
the Hornets are averaging 13,629 fans, the third-lowest average
attendance in the NBA.  Hornets President Hugh Weber will continue directing the
day-to-day activities of the team, the statement said.  Editor: Rob Gloster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
