Pfizer Inc ., the world’s largest
drugmaker, will recall about 19,000 bottles of  Lipitor  tablets
distributed in the U.S. after a customer reported a musty odor
from bottles in which the drug was packaged, the company said.  The odor is consistent with the presence of a chemical
called TBA that is linked to a wood preservative used in
shipping pallets, the New York-based company said today in a
 statement  posted on its website. The bottles containing 40-
milligram tablets of the cholesterol medicine, the world’s best-
selling drug, were from a third-party supplier, Pfizer said in
its statement.  This is the fourth Lipitor recall since August because of
complaints of an uncharacteristic odor, the company said in the
statement, bringing the total number bottles to 388,000. Pfizer
bans shipping its medicines on pallets made of wood preserved
with the chemical 2, 4, 6-tribromonophenol that caused the odor,
the company said in its statement.  “We have identified the source of the odor, and we are
enacting rigorous measures to prevent odor-related issues going
forward,” Pfizer said.  The same chemical was cited in recalls of  Johnson &
Johnson’s  Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicines earlier
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
