South Africa’s gold stocks index
rose the most in a week as the price of the metal gained after
tensions between North Korea and South Korea drove investors to
precious metals in safe-haven buying.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index  advanced as much as 2
percent to 2,775.17 and traded 1.6 percent higher at 2,764.83 by
2:29 p.m. in Johannesburg.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. , Africa’s
biggest gold-mining company, led increases.  Gold Fields Ltd. ,
the second-largest producer, gained the most since Dec. 2.  Gold surged as much as 1.2 percent to $1,388.38 an ounce,
the biggest advance in more than two weeks, as South Korea said
a live-fire drill that drew threats of retaliation from North
Korea ended without incident.  “Gold prices are closely leveraged to the price of the
metal,”  Patrick Mathidi , portfolio manager at RMB Asset
Management in Johannesburg, said by telephone. “The fringe
factors like the tensions on the Korean peninsula and the fact
that all other commodity prices are up will also have an impact
on the price of gold.”  AngloGold added 1.9 percent to 335.70 rand while Gold
Fields rose 1.7 percent to 123.77 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
