The United Nations Security Council
failed to agree on a statement to ease tension on the Korean
peninsula, Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin said.  “We have a situation of very serious political tension and
no game plan on the diplomatic side,” Churkin told reporters in
New York today after the 6-hour meeting.  Churkin urged South Korea not to conduct planned live-
firing drills today on an island that North Korea shelled last
month. He said he wants the UN Secretary General to appoint a
special envoy to Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
