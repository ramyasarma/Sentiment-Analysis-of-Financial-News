Harvard University may permit
student military training programs on its campus after the U.S.
Congress voted to repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” rule that
barred gays from serving openly in the armed forces.  The repeal is “a historic step,” and “affirms American
ideals of equal opportunity and underscores the importance of
the right to military service as a fundamental dimension of
citizenship,” Harvard President  Drew Faust  said in an e-mail on
Dec. 18. “I look forward to pursuing discussions with military
officials and others to achieve Harvard’s full and formal
recognition of ROTC,” the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.  The Senate voted Dec. 18 to repeal the “don’t ask, don’t
tell” law. The 65-31 tally sent the legislation to President
 Barack Obama  for his signature.  Faust’s e-mail didn’t say how long Harvard has banned ROTC
from the campus, or why. Under Harvard’s current policy,
students interested in ROTC may register and participate with
service programs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
according to Harvard’s  website . Both MIT and Harvard’s main
campus are in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Before the new U.S. policy takes effect, the Defense
Department must draft regulations and the president and Pentagon
leaders must certify that the change won’t hurt the nation’s war
efforts.  Since 1993, more than 14,000 service members have been
discharged for being gay, according to the  Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network , a gay-rights advocacy group based in
Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
