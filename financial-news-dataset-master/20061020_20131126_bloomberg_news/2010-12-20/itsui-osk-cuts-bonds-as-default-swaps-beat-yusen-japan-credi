Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. , operator
of the world’s largest merchant fleet, is slashing debt as
global trade recovers, driving the cost of protecting its bonds
against default below the levels of its rivals.  Five-year contracts to insure Mitsui O.S.K. debt declined
to 64 basis points on Dec. 17 from 141 at the end of last year,
according to CMA prices. Five-year contracts for Nippon Yusen
K.K. were 65 basis points, and those for Malaysia’s  MISC Bhd. ,
the world’s second-biggest shipper by market capitalization,
traded at 75 basis points, down from 91 at the end of 2009.  Mitsui O.S.K. will reduce debt for the first time in four
years as a recovery in global trade boosts cash flow and profit,
 Shugo Aoto , head of finance, said in an interview at the
company’s Tokyo headquarters last month. “We’re cash rich,”
Aoto said.  Global trade will climb 11.4 percent this year after
slumping 11 percent in 2009, the International Monetary Fund
forecast on Oct. 6. Mitsui will likely cut interest-bearing
debt to 750 billion yen ($8.9 billion) by the end of March,
from 775 billion yen a year earlier and below the company’s 770
billion yen target, Aoto said.  The cost of a five-year contract to protect Japanese
government bonds rose to 70 basis points, or $70,000 for $10
million of face value, on Dec. 17, from 68 on Dec. 31, 2009.
The nation’s public debt rose to 226 percent of gross domestic
product in 2010, according to IMF estimates.  Credit-default swaps for German bunds have climbed to 55
basis points from 26 at the end of 2009, while U.S. swaps
increased to 40 from 38.  ‘Good News’  The extra yield investors demand to hold Mitsui O.S.K.
five-year bonds sold in May 2009 instead of the 1.6 percent
Japanese government security due June 2014 shrank last week to
a record 12 basis points, from 45 when the 1.278 percent debt
was sold, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap for
A-rated five-year company debt shrank to 65 on Dec. 17 from 173
on June 1, 2009, the data show.  “Mitsui O.S.K.’s credit strategy, cash management and
reductions in debt are good news,” said  Mana Nakazora , the
chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas Securities Japan Ltd. “The
strategy is very good for their credit ratings.”  Moody’s Investors Service, which rates Mitsui  A3 , raised
its outlook on the shipping line to stable last month because
of the company’s improved profitability, dropping plans for a
possible downgrade. The credit rating of rival  Nippon Yusen ,
operator of the world’s second-largest merchant fleet, was cut
to Baa1 from A3 in February. Moody’s said the shipping line’s
profitability would “only recover gradually.” MISC is rated
 A3  by Moody’s with a stable outlook.  Continuing Improvement  “We assumed Mitsui O.S.K. would continue to improve when
we raised our outlook,” said  Mina Sawamura , an analyst in
Tokyo at Moody’s Japan K.K.  Moody’s downgraded 51 Japanese companies this year and
raised ratings on 11, while Standard & Poor’s cut 63 and
upgraded 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Moody’s
has downgraded 10 U.S. issuers for every nine upgrades this
year, the narrowest margin since 2007. S&P is poised to conduct
more increases than decreases on U.S. debt for the first time
since at least 2000.  Reducing Debt  Mitsui canceled a fleet expansion plan and returned
vessels after the global economy slid into recession following
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, Aoto
said. The shipping line had  905  vessels at the end of March,
compared with earlier plans to boost its fleet to 1,000 ships.
Nippon Yusen had  803 ships  at that time.  The reductions helped Mitsui report earnings last fiscal
year while Nippon Yusen and  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. , Japan’s
third-largest shipping line by sales, posted losses.  Mitsui on Oct. 29 reiterated its forecast that profit will
increase to 65 billion yen in the year ending March 2011, from
13 billion yen last fiscal year.  The company’s shares are up 15 percent this year, compared
with a 3.3 percent decline in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The
stock is still down 72 percent from a record high of 2,040 yen
touched in October 2007.  Mitsui’s cash from operations jumped 38 percent to  65
billion yen  in the three months ended Sept. 30, the most in two
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company
plans to repay 49 billion yen of bonds maturing next year and
expects to avoid issuing new bonds, Aoto said. It has  225
billion yen  of bonds outstanding, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  “Mitsui O.S.K. is bondholder friendly,” said Nakazora at
BNP Paribas.  Its debt reduction and improved credit outlook may make it
easier for Mitsui to borrow from banks, rather than the bond
market, according to  Yasuhiro Matsumoto , a credit analyst in
Tokyo at Shinsei Securities Co.  ‘Favorable Rate’  “Banks lack good lending opportunities,” said Matsumoto.
“If a good name comes to Japanese banks they will probably
make loans at a very favorable rate.”  Japanese companies reduced borrowing through loans for the
past 12 months and have added to cash reserves for eight-
straight quarters. Non-financial companies raised currency and
deposits 5 percent to 206 trillion yen in the 12 months ended
Sept. 30, the largest amount since quarterly data began in 1979,
the Bank of Japan said Dec. 17.  Confidence Slump  A BOJ report last week showed confidence among the
nation’s largest manufacturers worsened for the first time
since the end of the global financial crisis as the yen’s 11
percent climb threatened exporters, the driving force of the
economic recovery.  The yen climbed to 80.22 against the dollar on Nov. 1, the
highest level since April 1995, and traded at 83.88 at 2:09 p.m.
in Tokyo yesterday.  The economy will shrink 1.9 percent this quarter as Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan ’s stimulus spending fades, the government-
affiliated Economic Planning Association said last week, citing
forecasts from economists. The world’s second-largest economy
is struggling to end deflation, an extended decline in prices
that deters investment by crimping sales revenue and profit
margins while encouraging companies to put off spending to
benefit from lower costs in the future.  The difference between yields on five-year Japanese
government notes and inflation-linked debt widened one basis
point to minus 0.71 percent yesterday, an indication of the
annual average drop in prices investors expect over the coming
five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
