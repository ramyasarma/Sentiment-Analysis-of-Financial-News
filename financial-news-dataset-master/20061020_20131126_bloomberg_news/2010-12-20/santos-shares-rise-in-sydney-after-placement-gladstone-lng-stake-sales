Santos Ltd.  rose the most in five
months in Sydney after agreeing to sell stakes in its Australian
gas project to  Total SA  and Korea Gas Corp. and raising A$500
million ($494 million) in a share sale to help fund the venture.  Australia’s third-largest  oil and gas producer  climbed 4.1
percent to A$13.50 by the market’s 4:10 p.m. close, the biggest
gain since July 9, compared with a drop of 0.6 in the benchmark
 S&P/ASX 200 Index .  Santos, which was halted Dec. 17, completed a sale of about
39.8 million shares to institutional investors at A$12.55
apiece, the Adelaide-based company said in a statement today.
 James Bullen , an analyst at Bank of America Corp. Merrill Lynch,
had previously “feared” Santos would need to raise as much as
A$1.5 billion, he wrote in a report dated Dec. 17.  The Santos-led Gladstone liquefied natural gas project is
one of four on the central Queensland coast planning to liquefy
gas extracted from coal deposits for shipment to Asia. The
company agreed to sell 15 percent of the LNG venture to Total
and  Korea Gas  for A$665 million, it said Dec. 17.  Santos said last week the project would cost $16 billion.
Exports are due to begin in 2015, generating an average of $6
billion in revenue a year, it said.  The sale of 15 percent of the LNG venture reduces Santos’
“exposure” to any cost overruns or delays, Merrill Lynch said.
While the project has fixed prices with contractors, “we doubt
it can be fully effective against cost inflation and schedule
uncertainty in a crowded market for project construction,” the
analysts said.  BG Group Plc , the U.K.’s third-largest gas producer, said
Oct. 31 it would build the Queensland Curtis LNG project at a
cost of $15 billion.  ConocoPhillips  and  Origin Energy Ltd . also
plan a rival coal-seam gas-to-LNG venture in Queensland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
