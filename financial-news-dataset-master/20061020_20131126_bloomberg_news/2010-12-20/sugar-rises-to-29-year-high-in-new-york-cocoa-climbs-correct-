Raw sugar rose to a 29-year high in
New York on speculation that supplies from India and Brazil, the
world’s largest growers, won’t be enough to meet demand for a
third straight year. Cocoa also gained.  Global sugar output will lag behind demand by almost 3
million metric tons in the year that ends Sept. 30, ABN Amro
Bank NV and VM Group said Dec. 10, reversing a forecast for a
surplus. C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd. also predicted a
shortfall. Prices have climbed 22 percent this year.  “Sugar futures, fundamentally, are very bullish as we are
still looking for the deficit,” said  Naim Beydoun  of Swiss
Sugar Brokers in Rolle, Switzerland.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.46 cent, or 1.4

smaller crop.”  Cocoa futures for March delivery gained $7, or 0.2 percent,

least 32 people were killed in fighting since the disputed Nov.
28 presidential election. Cargill Inc. said today that its
“small number” of expatriate employees in have left Ivory
Coast, the largest cocoa producer.  UN Council Vote  The United Nations Security Council voted 15-0 today to

Boynton Beach, Florida, said in a report dated Dec. 18.  Coffee is no longer a “value commodity,” and roasters are
facing a “panic-stricken, demand-rationing orgy,” Hackett
said.  Robusta may climb to $2,500, he said by e-mail yesterday.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery rose 1.5 cents, or
