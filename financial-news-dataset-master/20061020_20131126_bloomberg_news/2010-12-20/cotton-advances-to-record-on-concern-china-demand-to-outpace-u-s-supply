Cotton prices jumped to a record in
New York, gaining by the daily limit for a third session, on
speculation that demand will rise as the U.S. economy
strengthens.  U.S. growth is accelerating as 2010 ends, with economists,
consumers and companies such as General Electric Co. becoming
more confident about next year’s outlook. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials jumped to the
highest level in more than two years, led by gains in cotton,
wheat and cocoa.  “It appears everybody wants to own commodities, and
cotton is involved in that,” said  Sid Love , the president of
 Joe Kropf  & Sid Love Consulting Services LLC in Overland Park,
Kansas. Prices are up “on a combination of people trying to do
business and speculative buying,” he said.  Cotton for March delivery gained by the exchange limit of
4 cents, or 2.7 percent, to a record $1.5412 a pound at 10:19
a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Prices have more than
doubled this year, heading for the biggest annual gain since
1973.  Cotton production in India, the world’s second-biggest
grower, will be less than previously forecast after excess
rainfall hampered harvests in some areas, according to the
Cotton Association.  “This is what we call smoke in the mirror,” said  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at Penson Futures in Atlanta. “We do
have some bullish fundamentals, but they are nowhere near what
we saw before. We’re up here mainly on technicals.”  Prices can go up another 3 or 4 cents, Johnson said.
“Once we turn, we will probably start a slow grind down for
two years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
