Google Inc. is asking hardware
manufacturers to hold off making any announcements about
equipment capable of using the Internet company’s television
software, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar
with the matter.  Both Sony Corp. and Logitech International SA make devices
capable of receiving Google TV, and have received negative
reviews; Samsung Electronics Co. still plans to present Google-
related products at January’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas, while Toshiba Corp. will not, the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
