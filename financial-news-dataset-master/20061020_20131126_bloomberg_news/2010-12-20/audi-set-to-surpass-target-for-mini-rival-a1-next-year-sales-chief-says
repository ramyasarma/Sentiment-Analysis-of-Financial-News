Audi AG,  Volkswagen AG ’s luxury-car
brand, will probably beat its target for A1 deliveries next year
and may further increase production to meet demand for the
subcompact, the unit’s sales chief said in an interview.  Audi anticipates selling 120,000 A1s in 2011, compared with
a previous projection of 100,000, and may boost the goal again,
 Peter Schwarzenbauer  said by telephone. Audi plans to use about
20,000 of the 50,000 units built in 2010 to promote the model at
dealerships and for demonstrations.  “After getting feedback from our dealers, it’s clear that
our production rates may need to be increased again to satisfy
demand,” the executive said. “We are extremely confident that
the A1 will be a huge success for us and are running far ahead
of plan in some markets,” including the U.K. and France.  Audi, which aims to topple  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  as
the luxury leader by 2015, is targeting record worldwide
deliveries this year of more than 1.08 million cars and sport-
utility vehicles, an increase of 14 percent from 2009. Eleven-
month sales climbed 15 percent to 1 million vehicles, surpassing
Audi’s previous full-year record set in 2008.  Audi’s smallest model is designed to vie for affluent young
customers with BMW’s Mini in the upscale small-car segment.
Luxury-car makers are boosting their compact offerings as
regulators mandate vehicles with lower emissions. Daimler AG’s
Mercedes-Benz is doubling its lineup of small cars to four
models as part of a 1.4 billion-euro ($1.8 billion) expansion.  Shares Advance  VW preferred shares rose as much as 5 euros, or 4.1
percent, to 126.80 euros and were up 2.7 percent at 11:15 a.m.
in Frankfurt trading. The  stock  has surged 91 percent this year,
valuing the Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker at 54.9 billion
euros. BMW was up 1.4 percent, while Daimler gained 1 percent.  It’s unclear whether Audi’s three-door hatchback will
succeed in besting Mini, said  Tim Urquhart , a London-based
analyst with IHS Automotive. The A1’s average selling price is
24,000 euros, 52 percent more than the car’s entry price in
Germany of 15,800 euros. Mini starts at 15,550 euros.  “The thing is too expensive and not interesting or
different enough,” Urquhart said by telephone. “It’s not
unique enough compared with Mini and that’s what they’re up
against.”  The A1, which is 23 centimeters longer than the Mini
hatchback, has 47,982 fans on  Facebook , compared with Mini’s
693,516 fans. The A1 features a line along the edge of the roof
that can be painted in colors to contrast with the body paint
and to discourage customers from confusing it with the more
expensive A3. The lowest-priced A3 costs 5,150 euros more than
the 28-centimeter shorter A1.  Chinese Boom  Audi predicts A1 sales will get a further boost when it
introduces a version with a less powerful and cheaper diesel
engine than the current 1.6-liter diesel, which starts at 18,800
euros. It also plans to sell the cars in  markets  such as Brazil,
Argentina, and eventually China.  Chief Financial Officer  Axel Strotbek  forecast last week
China will become Audi’s largest market next year “at the
latest” as sales in the country boom. Chinese deliveries this
year are running neck-and-neck with Germany. Audi’s eleven-month
Chinese sales surged 50 percent to 209,800 vehicles.  Audi, which says it sold out of the A1 sales allotment for
2010 of 30,000 cars in mid-November, delivered about 21,000
vehicles through the end of last month. The manufacturer expects
the A1 next year to come close to matching the German sales of
 BMW ’s Mini, which is available as a hatchback, wagon,
convertible, and four-door crossover.  “We are doing this with one derivative, while Mini has
four,” said Schwarzenbauer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
