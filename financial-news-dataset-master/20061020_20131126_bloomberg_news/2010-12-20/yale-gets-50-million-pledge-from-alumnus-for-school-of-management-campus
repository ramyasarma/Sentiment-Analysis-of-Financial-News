Yale University received a $50
million commitment to help construct a new building for its
School of Management from  Edward P. Evans , a former publishing
executive.  The gift from Evans, a graduate of the Yale College class
of 1964, is the largest in the business school’s history, Yale,
in New Haven, Connecticut, said today in a  statement  on its
website. Evans was the chairman and chief executive officer of
publisher Macmillan Inc. from 1979 to 1989, according to the
university.  “The School of Management’s new home will be as forward-
looking as its pioneering curriculum,”  Richard C. Levin , the
university’s president, said in the statement. “With this gift,
Ned Evans has expressed confidence in the school’s future and
ensured that construction can proceed without putting undue
pressure on our budget.”  Yale School of Management opened in 1974 and is the
youngest of six business schools in the Ivy League, a group of
eight private colleges in the northeast U.S. The new building,
on a 4.25-acre site, will take Evans’s name.  Construction began this year and is scheduled for
completion in 2013, with an estimated cost of $189 million, said
Tabitha Wilde, a Yale spokeswoman.  In past gifts, Evans supported the renovation and expansion
of the Yale University Press building and the renewal of
residential colleges, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
