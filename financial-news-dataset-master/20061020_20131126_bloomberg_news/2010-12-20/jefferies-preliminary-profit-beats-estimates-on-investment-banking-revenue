Jefferies Group Inc. , the New York-
based firm that has been expanding advisory and trading units,
reported preliminary earnings that beat analysts’ estimates on
record  investment-banking  revenue.  Net income was $70.7 million, or 35 cents a share, for the
three months ended Nov. 30, compared with $93.5 million, or 46
cents, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2009, the company said
today in a statement. Jefferies was expected to report a profit
of 32 cents, the average of eight analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg.  Jefferies, led by Chief Executive Officer  Richard B. Handler , 49, has increased its headcount by more than 25 percent
since 2008, taking advantage of the collapse of larger
securities firms. Jefferies said on a conference call today that
some investors are moving to equities from  fixed income , which
accounts for 36 percent of the company’s revenue.  “We’ve seen massive flows of money into fixed-income
mutual funds,”  Richard Bove , an analyst for Rochdale Securities
LLC in Lutz, Florida, said in an interview. “If that flow
shifts in a different direction, clearly they’re going to be
impacted by it.”  Shares  of the company fell 39 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$26.27 at 10:46 a.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.  New Jobs  Investment-banking  revenue  rose 51 percent to $291.9
million from $193.9 million in last year’s fourth quarter. The
company has added 456 jobs this year, Chief Financial Officer
 Peregrine Broadbent  said on the call.  The results were preliminary because Jefferies is trying to
reconcile differences in records between it and an unnamed
clearing bank that deals with a portion of its fixed-income
business. The clearing bank’s records differ from Jefferies’s
figures by $39 million, and if correct, may cause 2010 profit to
be reduced by 7 cents to $1.08, the firm said in the statement.  Jefferies earlier this year said it would change its fiscal
year-end to Nov. 30, so March results were included in first-
quarter and second-quarter earnings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
