A member of South Africa’s  Congress
of the People  opposition party died at a conference in Pretoria,
the  Times reported , citing the party’s regional organizer Kwezi
Ntshanyana.  The reason for the death of the 40-year-old man is unknown,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported late yesterday, citing
party spokesman Phillip Dexter.  Followers of the two rival candidates for the party
leadership came to blows over the weekend as they competed for
power in South Africa’s third-biggest opposition party, the
Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
