Newark Liberty International
Airport’s Terminal A reopened this morning after being shut down
for a suspicious package that turned out to be a computer
monitor.  The New Jersey air terminal was closed after the monitor
was found behind a ticket counter in a luggage screening area
that wasn’t accessible to the public, said  Tim Smith , a
spokesman for  American Airlines , the third-biggest U.S. carrier.  The monitor was emitting “small amounts of radiation,”
which is normal for such a device, Bryan L. Travers, a spokesman
for the Newark office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
said in an e-mail.  The device was being shipped to the same destination as its
owner, who was already in flight, Travers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
