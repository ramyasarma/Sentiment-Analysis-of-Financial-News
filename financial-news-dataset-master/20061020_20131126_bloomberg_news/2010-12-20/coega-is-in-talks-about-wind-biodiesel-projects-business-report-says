South Africa’s Coega Development
Corp., a state-owned agency in the Eastern Cape Province, said
it is in talks over 3.5 billion rand ($511 million) worth of
biodiesel and wind power projects, Business Report said, citing
Nkuli Mxenge, the group’s manager for business development.  Coega is in talks with Electrawinds NV, Innowind and
Universal Wind, he said, according to the Johannesburg-based
newspaper. Wind projects could account for 2.5 billion rand of
the investment and could generate 250 megawatts when complete,
he said.  Coega is in talks with Australian and German investors over
the biodiesel projects, Mxenge said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
