South Africa’s rand strengthened for
the first day in four as prices of the nation’s commodity
exports gained and on speculation foreign investors continued to
purchase the currency to benefit from its yield advantage.  The rand appreciated as much as 1 percent to 6.8121 per
dollar and traded at 6.8359 by 4:12 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a
previous close of 6.88. Against the euro, the rand added 0.8
percent to 8.9975.  “Rand strength has been significantly boosted by massive
inflows into South Africa by foreigners,” Tradition Analytics
analysts, led by  Quinten Bertenshaw  in Johannesburg, wrote in a
client note today. “The longer-term trend continues to favor
ongoing rand resilience and strength.”  Foreign investors have purchased a net 101.1 billion rand
($15 billion) of South African stocks and bonds this year as
near zero-interest rates in developed nations spurred demand for
higher-yield investments, according to data from JSE Ltd., the
company that runs South Africa’s main bourses. The purchases
helped the rand extend its rally since the start of last year to
more than 37 percent.  South Africa’s  5.5 percent  benchmark interest rate compares
with deposit returns of 0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25 percent in
the U.S.  Gold and platinum, which together account for about a fifth
of South Africa’s exports, rose as investors purchased the
precious metals by buying exchange-traded products backed by the
commodities.  Government bonds advanced in South Africa for a second day,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
climbing 11 cents to 123.85 rand. The yield declined 3 basis
points, or 0.03 percentage points, to 7.43 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
