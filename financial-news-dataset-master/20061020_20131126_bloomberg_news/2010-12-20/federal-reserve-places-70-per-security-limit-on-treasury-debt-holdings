The Federal Reserve said it will
limit its purchases to 70 percent of any single Treasury
security as part of its plan to expand its balance sheet that’s
known as quantitative easing.  The central bank had temporarily relaxed its 35 percent
limit in November when announcing additional purchases of $600
billion of Treasuries through June. The  New York Fed  in a
statement today gave allowable purchase percentages for three
brackets in its system open market account, or SOMA, consisting
of securities it holds, from more than 30 percent to 70 percent.  The Fed has acquired about $144.249 billion of Treasuries
since it resumed buying U.S. government debt on Nov. 12. The
central bank bought $14.569 billion in debt through two open-
market operations today, the largest amount since it restarted
the program after completing $1.7 trillion in debt purchases in
March.  “This gives some clarification on what the end game is for
the Fed with regard to individual security purchases,” said
 Thomas Simons,  a government-debt economist in New York at
Jefferies Group Inc., one of the 18 primary dealer that trade
with the central bank. “There are some issues that the Fed
holds over 40 percent and people were wondering if they would
remain cheap if there was no liquidity because the Fed owns them
all. Now not only can the Fed not own 100 percent of an issue,
it will also take them considerably longer to increase its
holdings.”  Individual Holdings  The Fed introduced a sliding scale for the amount of an
individual security it can purchase in an operation when it
already owns over 30 percent. The percentage of incremental debt
it can buy of a particular security declines as the percent held
in its SOMA account increases.  As of Dec. 17, the Fed owned 49.93 percent of the 8.75
percent coupon Treasury note maturing Aug. 15, 2020, and 49.82
percent of the 8.5 percent coupon note maturing in Feb. 15,
2020, according to Fed data compiled by Barclays Plc.  The Fed had said Nov. 3 that it would allow individual
security holdings to top the previously self-imposed 35 percent
level “only in modest increments,” according to a statement
posted that day on the New York Fed’s website. Once a security
reached 30 percent, “additional purchases of the given security
will generally be capped at 5 percent of the total outstanding
issue size in each subsequent operation,” the statement said.  The central bank also plans to reinvest $250 billion to
$300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed debt and agency
securities into Treasuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
