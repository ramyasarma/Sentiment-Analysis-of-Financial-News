U.K. stocks  climbed for a second
day, pushing the benchmark FTSE 100 Index to the highest level
since June 2008, amid speculation the recovery in the global
economy will continue.  Rio Tinto Group, Anglo American Plc and  BHP Billiton Ltd. 
rose more than 2 percent as higher metals prices boosted the
outlook for raw-material companies. Rolls-Royce Group Plc gained
2 percent after Citigroup Inc. advised buying the shares. Mondi
Plc, Europe’s largest maker of office paper, led shares on the
FTSE 250 Index higher as Finland’s UPM-Kymmene Oyj agreed to
acquire two rival papermakers.  The  FTSE 100  climbed 60.19, or 1 percent, to 5,951.8 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has rallied 10 percent in
2010 as companies reported higher earnings, the European Union
bailed out Greece and Ireland and the Federal Reserve unveiled a
$600 billion bond-purchase plan to boost growth, a tactic known
as quantitative easing. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also rose 1
percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  advanced 1.3 percent.  “We’re getting above-trend growth and that’s a good
thing,”  James Sweeney , a global strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG, said on Bloomberg Radio with  Tom Keene  in New York.

since July. UPM, Europe’s second-largest papermaker, agreed to
buy Myllykoski Oyj and Rhein Papier GmbH for about 900 million
euros ($1.2 billion) in total as the industry consolidates in
response to higher production costs and a shift in demand to
digital publications. The takeovers may spur further mergers and
acquisitions in the industry, according to a report by UBS AG
analysts today.
