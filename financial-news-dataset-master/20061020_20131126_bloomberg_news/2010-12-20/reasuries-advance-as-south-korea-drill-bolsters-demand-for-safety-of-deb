Treasuries advanced for a third day,
the longest run of gains this month, as escalating tensions on
the Korean peninsula drove investors to the perceived safety of
U.S. government debt.  Bonds also rose as yields about one percentage point higher
than this  year’s low  attracted buyers. South Korea said a live-
fire drill today was completed without incident after threats of
retaliation from North Korea. The Federal Reserve is scheduled
to  buy  as much as $17 billion of Treasuries due between 2014 and
2020 today.  “The thing in Korea is of course something that markets
are aware of and lying in the background,” said  Rasmus Rousing ,
a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.
“Any kind of global crisis will trigger a rally in
Treasuries.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note slipped one basis
point to 3.32 percent as of 6:03 a.m. in New York, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent security due in November
2020 gained 3/32, or $0.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 94 5/32.  Treasuries rallied Dec. 16 and Dec. 17, pushing 10-year
yields down by 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point. The
yield climbed to 3.56 percent on Dec. 16, from the low this year
of 2.33 percent on Oct. 8.  Ten-year rates will drop to 2.98 percent by March 31,
according to a Bloomberg survey of financial analysts with the
most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  Live-fire drills “would make it impossible to prevent the
situation on the Korean peninsula from exploding,” North
Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency cited the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs as saying on Dec. 18.  Flattening Curve  U.S. government bonds fell this month as the gap between
yields on longer-maturity Treasuries showed the Fed’s purchases,
its second round of quantitative easing, may be its last.  The  difference  between 10- and 30-year yields shrank to
1.05 percentage points on Dec. 15 from a record 1.60 points on
Nov. 10, the fastest contraction since the 1980s, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The shift in the so-called yield
curve is taking place as Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data show U.S. bonds due in 10 years or more lost 4.64 percent
this month, trimming 2010’s gain to 8.37 percent.  Flattening usually foreshadows the end of Fed interest-rate
cuts aimed at stimulating growth. U.S. reports this month showed
gains in  retail sales , consumer confidence and industrial
production after the central bank expanded its  balance sheet  to
an unprecedented $2.39 trillion, pumping money into the
financial system. It’s adding $600 billion more, purchasing
Treasuries through so-called quantitative easing.  End of Cycle  “A peak in the yield spread between 10s and 30s signals
the end of an easing cycle,” said  Steven Wieting , managing
director of economic and market analysis at Citigroup Inc.
“It’s part of a recovery and improved growth expectations. If
the outlook is for a stronger recovery, then QE would be limited
and they may not expand beyond it.”  The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.8 percent annual pace in
the third quarter, quicker than the 2.5 percent estimate
published last month, the Commerce Department will say Dec. 22,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Spending by consumers rose
0.5 percent in November after a 0.4 percent increase in October,
a separate survey showed before the Dec. 23 report.  “The economy continues to recover,” said  Hiroki Shimazu ,
a Tokyo-based economist at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., part
of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-largest
publicly traded bank by assets. “Fear of deflation will
gradually disappear. It will push up yields.”  Less Bearish Outlook  The 10-year rate may rise to 3.5 percent by June 30,
Shimazu said.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities, widened to
2.29 percentage points from this year’s low of 1.47 percentage
points in August. The five-year average is 2.09 percentage
points.  Fund managers in a weekly survey by Ried Thunberg ICAP Inc.
became less bearish on the outlook for Treasuries through March.  Ried’s sentiment index rose to 48 for the seven days ended
Dec. 17 from 46 the week before. A figure less than 50 indicates
investors expect prices to fall. The company, which is a unit of
the world’s largest interdealer broker and is based in Jersey
City, New Jersey, surveyed 26 money managers controlling $1.38
trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
