Newcrest Mining Ltd. , Australia’s
largest gold mining company, evacuated executives at its Bonikro
mine in Ivory Coast to Ghana after post-election violence.  Work has been reduced to a minimum at the mine, located
near Hire, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of the
commercial capital Abidjan, Melbourne-based Newcrest said today
in a statement.  Operations at the mine have been suspended since the first
week of December as at least 32 people have been killed in
fighting in Ivory Coast since last month’s disputed presidential
election. Bonikro produces about 120,000 ounces of gold a year.  Security and local employees are “maintaining the site in
preparation for a resumption of operations as soon as
possible,” the company said.  Newcrest  rose 0.4 percent at A$40.55 at the 10:29 a.m.
Sydney time on the Australian stock exchange.  Separately, the company said it’s working to reopen a part
of the Kencana underground mine at its Gosowong operation in
Indonesia after the movement of “mudstone” material on Dec. 19
blocked access to the area and trapped two workers.  Contact has been established with the two unharmed men are
and a full recovery is expected to take “several days,”
Newcrest said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
