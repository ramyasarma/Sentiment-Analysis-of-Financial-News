Hong Kong’s  Air Pollution Index  was
“very high” at all three of the city’s roadside monitoring
stations as low-strength wind fail to disperse pollutants blown
in from China, the Environmental Protection Department said.  The index was 167 at Causeway Bay, 143 in Mong Kok and 125
in Central at 3 p.m., the department said on its web site. The
pollution level may remain high for a few days, it said in an
e-mailed statement.  Roadside pollution readings above 100 trigger a government
warning for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  The high level of smog is caused by pollutants from
mainland China, while “light winds” at ground level mean some
chemicals aren’t dispersing, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
