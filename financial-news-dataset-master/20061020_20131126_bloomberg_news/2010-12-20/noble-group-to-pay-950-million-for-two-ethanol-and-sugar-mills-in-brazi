Noble Group Ltd. , the commodities
firm backed by China’s sovereign fund, agreed to buy sugar mills
in Brazil for $950 million, including debt, to increase its
production of the sweetener by 81 percent.  Noble will acquire the Catanduva and Potirendaba mills for
$350 million in cash and $600 million in assumed debt from
 Cerradinho Acucar, Etanol & Energia SA , the Hong Kong-based
company said in a regulatory filing today. The deal will
increase Noble’s annual sugar production capacity to 1.34
million metric tons from 740,000 tons now, it said.  The group aims to double annual profit to $1 billion in
three years as consumption of sugar, grains, coal and other
resources increases in Asia, Chief Executive Officer  Ricardo Leiman  said Sept. 28. Singapore-based Noble said today it plans
to use existing resources to pay for the acquisition.  Noble  fell 1.5 percent to close at S$2.04 today on the
Singapore Exchange, the lowest since Nov. 29. The stock has
declined 3 percent this year. The purchase was announced after
regular trading had ended in Asian markets.  Cerradinho is based in Catanduva, Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
