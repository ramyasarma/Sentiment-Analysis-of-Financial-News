The zloty weakened toward the lowest
level in more than a week on concern the debt crisis in the euro
area, Poland’s largest trading partner, is deepening.  The zloty lost 0.4 percent to 3.9984 per euro as of 11:47
a.m. in Warsaw, the second-steepest drop among more than 20
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after Hungary’s
forint. A close at that level would be the Polish currency’s
weakest since Dec. 10.  Irish legislation to fix the nation’s financial system may
hinder the European Central Bank’s liquidity operations, the
European Central Bank said in a Dec. 17 report. Exports to
countries sharing the common currency accounted for 55.2 percent
of Polish companies’ sales abroad in the first 10 months of this
year, according to the  statistics office . Investors also became
more skittish as South Korea completed a live-firing drill and
the United Nations Security Council didn’t agree on steps to
ease tension in the region.  “Over the weekend further deterioration of global market
sentiment occurred,” Bank Zachodni WBK SA economists wrote in a
note to customers. The “worries over debt problems in Europe
were accompanied by information on the possible attack of North
Korea in response” to a South Korean military exercise.  The zloty should stabilize after depreciating beyond 3.99
per euro, according to Bank Zachodni. The zloty slid 1.6 percent
in the past month as Ireland followed Greece to become the
second euro area nation to request financial aid this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
