The only strategist to predict the
decline and recovery in  Japanese stocks  this year now says the
Topix index will surge 20 percent in six months.  Kathy Matsui , chief Japan equity strategist for  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc . in Tokyo, is telling clients to buy automakers
and technology producers because  profits  will rise as the yen
retreats against the dollar after reaching a 15-year high in
October. She has history on her side. Two months after the yen
peaked in April 1995, the Topix started a  44 percent  rally over
12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Many investors make the mistake of becoming too
emotionally hung up on Japan’s structural problems, and
therefore they miss the cyclical opportunities,” said Matsui,
45, who has covered Japanese equities for 20 years. “If you
have the stars aligned with a better U.S. economy, a weaker yen,
earnings going back to 2007 peaks and very underweight foreign
investors, that could easily deliver 15 to 20 percent.”  Matsui, a Harvard University graduate who first visited
Japan on a scholarship to Kobe University in 1986, is bullish
even after  confidence  among the nation’s largest manufacturers
fell for the first time since March 2009,  unemployment  climbed
and executives’ reluctance to invest pushed cash reserves to an
all-time high. The Topix briefly erased its year-to-date loss
last  week , gaining 1.7 percent to 903.14. The gauge declined 0.5
percent today.  American Sales  The  index  of 1,664 Japanese companies will rise 20 percent
to 1,080 in the next six months before slumping to 1,000 by the
end of 2011, she said. Matsui, a California native who was named
a  Goldman Sachs  partner in 2000, favors companies with the
highest proportion of U.S. sales.  Nikon Corp.  and  Bridgestone
Corp . are among  31 stocks  she recommends because they may
benefit from American shoppers buying more cars, computers and
smartphones.  The yen’s influence on Japanese equities has never been
greater, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The so-called 120-day
 correlation  coefficient of the Nikkei 225 Stock Index reached
minus 0.34 on Nov. 25, the strongest inverse relationship since
at least 1991. The gauge measures the degree to which the index
moves in the opposite direction of the currency. The Nikkei fell
0.9 percent today.  In a year when the average forecaster in Japan was wrong by
20 percentage points, Matsui’s projection last December that the
 Topix  would rise to 1,050 and then fall to 800 stood out. The
index advanced 10 percent to 998.90 on April 15 and then
retreated 20 percent to 803.12 on Nov. 2.  2010 Slump  Strategists at banks from Morgan Stanley to Credit Suisse
Group AG predicted a 20 percent rally in Japanese shares, the
biggest annual gain since 2005, based on the average of eight
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The index instead slumped 0.5
percent this year as the yen surged 11 percent against the
dollar, cutting the value of  profits  for Japan’s exporters.  Goldman Sachs “has been quite good for Japan equities,”
said  Pearlyn Wong , a Singapore-based investment analyst at Bank
Julius Baer, which manages about $275 billion. “I do look at
their research quite regularly.”  Matsui, who earned her master’s degree from  Johns Hopkins
University  in 1990 and worked at the Export-Import Bank of
Japan’s Washington office and Barclays de Zoete Wedd before
joining Goldman in 1994, raised her rating on Japan stocks to
“neutral” from “underweight” on Nov. 12 on speculation
faster U.S. growth may cause the yen to depreciate against the
dollar. The Topix has advanced 6.6 percent since then.  Predictions for U.S. growth next year have risen to 2.6
percent, the median of 66 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, from
2.4 percent in October. Goldman Sachs is more optimistic,
forecasting gross domestic product will increase 2.7 percent in
2011, after the Federal Reserve said on Nov. 3 that it plans to
buy up to $600 billion of Treasuries to stimulate inflation.  Unanimous Bulls  Now Matsui, who takes Japanese cooking lessons in her spare
time, has plenty of company. Strategists forecast the country’s
shares will advance 16 percent in 2011, based on the average
estimate from nine banks tracked by Bloomberg. They’re counting
on  valuations  near the cheapest on record to lift shares.  That wasn’t enough to boost equities in the world’s second-
largest economy in 2010. Companies in the Topix started the year
trading at an average 1.1 times  book value , almost half the
valuation of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Japanese  multiple  fell to 0.96 in
November, the lowest level since at least 1993, before climbing
to 1.08 last week.  ‘Barely Grew’  Byron Wien , the Blackstone Advisory Services vice chairman
who called Japan stocks one of the best bets for 2010 last
January, says he’s “neutral” after  Bank of Japan  policies to
stimulate economic growth failed to reverse 20 months of
deflation. A gauge of Japan’s  consumer prices  excluding fresh
food fell 0.6 percent from a year earlier, the statistics bureau
said Nov. 26 in Tokyo.  “I have been disappointed by Japan,” said Wien in an e-
mailed response to questions. “The economy barely grew and
deflation persisted. I’m not thinking much about Japan these
days.”  Japan’s economy may shrink 0.5 percent in the three months
ending December, according to the median estimate from 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The forecasts also show GDP
may rise 1.4 percent next year, the  slowest  growth since 2002.  The weakening economy and Japan’s $10.5 trillion in public
debt, the most in the world, has made the Topix the worst
performer among 30 major market indexes since global equities
bottomed last year. The benchmark gained 27 percent since March
9, 2009, compared with 84 percent for the S&P 500 and 75 percent
for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  Losing Confidence  Japanese executives don’t share Matsui’s bullish outlook.
The quarterly Tankan index of sentiment at large manufacturers
dropped to 5 in December from 8 in September, the BOJ said in
Tokyo on Dec. 15. The measure is expected to fall to minus 2 in
March, and companies submitted the strongest forecast for the
yen since data began in 1996. A positive number means optimists
outnumber pessimists.  Concern that the economy is contracting may keep executives
from spending. Japan’s non-financial companies have increased
cash holdings for eight straight quarters and held 206 trillion
yen ($2.5 trillion) in currency and  deposits  as of Sept. 30, the
BOJ said on Dec. 17. That’s the largest amount since comparable
data began in 1979.  “The longer term-picture is still pretty difficult,” said
 Shane Oliver , who oversees about $85 billion as head of
investment strategy at Sydney-based AMP Capital Investors Ltd.
“The growth potential in the Japanese economy is so poor and
Japan just seems to have this chronic inability to do anything
about deflation.”  Oliver said he reduced his allocation to Japan shares to
“moderately overweight” from “overweight” three months ago.  35 Trillion Yen  The BOJ is trying to spur growth with 35 trillion yen of
asset purchases and cut its target  interest rate  to as low as
zero in October. The central bank created a 5 trillion yen fund
to buy bonds and assets and said on Dec. 14 it will start
acquiring real-estate investment trusts and exchange-traded
funds.  Yields on euroyen futures signal the BOJ won’t raise
interest rates until at least June 2012. Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  will leave the overnight lending rate in a range
between zero and 0.1 percent at a policy meeting ending tomorrow,
according to all 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Kunihiko Sugio , who oversees about $7 billion as chief
investment officer for Invesco Asset Management (Japan) Ltd.,
says Japanese stocks can overcome the weakening economy should
U.S. growth improve. Analysts’ estimates for companies in the
 Nikkei  show annual profits may reach 788.93 yen a share for  2012 ,
the highest level since 2007’s peak of  852.08 yen,  according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreign Investors  Foreign investors hold fewer of the country’s shares
compared with the benchmark  MSCI EAFE Index  of 968 developed-
market companies, says Matsui. International equity funds have
allocated 15.2 percent of assets to Japan shares, compared with
an approximate 20 percent  weighting  in the measure of  equities 
from Europe, Asia and Israel, according to data compiled by
Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg.  “Next year, with a stronger U.S. economy, we think that
focus will start to return to Japanese stocks,” said Sugio in
an interview from Tokyo. “Japanese export shares should rise
easily.”  The yen has weakened 5 percent to an almost 3-month low of
84.51 per dollar since Nov. 1, when it reached 80.22, the
strongest level since April 1995.  Nikon, Bridgestone  Nikon , which gets more than 30 percent of its revenue from
North America, has risen 7.8 percent to 1,640 yen since Nov. 1,
when the yen began depreciating. The shares advanced even after
the Tokyo-based maker of cameras and lenses reduced its annual
profit forecast on Nov. 4.  Bridgestone, the world’s largest tiremaker, has gained 13
percent to 1,607 yen since Nov. 1, paring its year-to-date drop
to 1.2 percent. The Tokyo-based company that got 43 percent of
its revenue from North and South America last year rose amid
record rubber prices, which reached as high as 400.9 yen per
kilogram on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange on Dec. 17.  For every one yen decrease versus the dollar, companies in
the Nomura 400 stock index gain 0.5 percent of their recurring
profit, according to  Takashi Ito , a strategist at the Tokyo-
based firm. He said income at automakers and software developers
will benefit the most, rising 2.5 percent and 2.3 percent,
respectively, for every one yen decline. Raw-material producers
and real-estate developers are least affected by the currency’s
depreciation.  “Japan has a way of having these short spurts of
outperformance,” said Matsui. “If you don’t catch the wave
quickly, you can miss it.”  Strategists Year-End Forecasts for Japan Stocks in 2011  *T Firm               Strategist          Topix
