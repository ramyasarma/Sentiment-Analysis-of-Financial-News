OAO Uralkali, Russia’s largest
potash producer by market value, may issue 1.2 billion new
shares as it takes over competitor OAO Silvinit, said Chief
Executive Officer Pavel Grachev.  Uralkali now has about 2.1 billion shares outstanding,
according to the company website.  The potash producer will apply for antitrust approval for
the takeover of Silvinit later this week, Grachev said today on
