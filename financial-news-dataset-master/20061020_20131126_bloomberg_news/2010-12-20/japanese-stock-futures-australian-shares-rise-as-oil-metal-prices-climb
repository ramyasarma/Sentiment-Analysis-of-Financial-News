Australian shares rose as commodity prices advanced and analysts
raised share-price estimates and ratings on U.S. companies,

second-biggest maker of earthmoving machines, gained 0.3 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Sony Corp., a
Japanese electronics maker, increased 0.6 percent. BHP Billiton

producer, climbed 0.5 percent in Sydney today.  “Consensus is forming that the global economy is gradually
getting better,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. “Growth in the world
economy is boosting commodity prices, and surplus money is going
into commodities and stocks.”  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
