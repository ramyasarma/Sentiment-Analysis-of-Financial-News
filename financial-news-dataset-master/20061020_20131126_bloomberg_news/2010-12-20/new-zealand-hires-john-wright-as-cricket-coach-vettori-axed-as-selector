New Zealand hired John Wright as
cricket coach to replace Mark Greatbatch after the team lost 11
straight one-day internationals.  Wright, a former opening batsman and captain of the
national team, will take charge of the Black Caps immediately,
with his first match as coach the Dec. 26 Twenty20 international
against Pakistan, New Zealand Cricket said.  Greatbatch was retained as a national selector and batting
coach following a review of the team’s tour to India in November
and December, where it lost the Test and one-day series. It also
suffered a 4-0 defeat in Bangladesh in October.  “The changes being made are a direct result of that
process and should make a real difference,” New Zealand Cricket
Chief Executive Officer  Justin Vaughan  said in a statement.  Greatbatch will head a new three-man independent selection
panel that includes Lance Cairns and Glenn Turner, NZC Cricket
said. Although removed from the panel, captain  Daniel Vettori 
will continue to assist in the selection process, the governing
body said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
