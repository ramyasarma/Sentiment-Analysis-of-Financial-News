Rwanda will cut spending in this
year’s budget review on lower-than-expected tax collections, New
Times reported citing Finance Minister John Rwangombwa.  The east African country has collected 189 billion Rwandan
francs ($320 million) of taxes, compared with a target of 479
billion francs, it said. The government expects to cut the 2011
fiscal year’s 899 billion franc budget by as much as 8.5 billion
francs, New Times said, citing Rwangombwa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
