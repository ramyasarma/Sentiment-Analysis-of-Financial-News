EBay Inc.,  the largest e-commerce
marketplace, agreed to buy Brands4friends, Germany’s biggest
online shopping club, to increase fashion sales in Europe.  EBay will pay $200 million in the deal, the San Jose,
California-based company said today. EBay will also gain
Brands4friends’ equity stakes in U.K. shopping club
SecretSales.com and in Japan’s brands4friends.jp.  Online shopping clubs account for about 20 percent of Web
fashion sales in Europe, EBay said, citing its own research.
EBay gets more than $5.4 billion annually from fashion sales.  “The move is designed to strengthen EBay’s position as a
leading online fashion destination in Europe,” the company
said.  The 3.5 million registered club members at Brands4friends
in Germany are eligible to buy goods from clothing and
“lifestyle” brands at reduced prices.  “We are optimistic about the outlook, especially for
fashion, where the switch to online from offline continues,”
 Stephan Zoll , head of EBay Germany, said in a telephone
interview today.  The focus for now will be on Germany, said Zoll, adding
that EBay “will be able to leverage Brands4friends’ expertise
internationally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
