Most  Canadian stocks  gained as
energy stocks rose after an acquisition in the shale-gas
industry and gold futures rallied with concern over European
government debt.  Talisman Energy Inc., which produces oil and gas in North
America, the North Sea and Indonesia, advanced 4.8 percent after
agreeing to sell shale-gas assets to Sasol Ltd. Toronto-Dominion
Bank, the country’s second-largest lender by assets, fell 2.3
percent after three people with knowledge of the matter said it
is close to an agreement to buy Chrysler Financial. Goldcorp
Inc., the world’s second-largest gold producer by market value,
increased 1.4 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  lost 8.18 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 13,193.28. Among S&P/TSX stocks, 140 gained,
93 fell and 11 were unchanged.  The Talisman deal “is positive for Canadian stocks,” said
 Mathieu Roy , who helps manage C$1.5 billion ($1.47 billion) as a
money manager at Louisbourg Investments Inc. in Moncton, New
Brunswick. “It suggests the money’s there to develop. A lot of
Canadian companies with North American resources can grow them
more quickly because they won’t have any trouble finding
partners.”  The index slipped  0.3 percent  last week as gold futures
declined and Bank of Montreal announced the $4.1 billion
purchase of Milwaukee-based lender Marshall & Ilsley Corp.
Financial and natural resources companies make up 76 percent of
Canadian stocks by market value, according to Bloomberg data.
The index increased 12 percent this year through Dec. 17.  Talisman Climbs  Talisman climbed 4.8 percent, the most in 14 months, to
C$21.89 after agreeing to sell a 50 percent stake in its Farrell
Creek shale-gas assets to Johannesburg-based Sasol for C$1.05
billion ($1.04 billion). The advance extended a 29-month high.  Progress Energy Resources Corp., which also owns shale-gas
projects in western Canada, surged 8 percent, the most in 14
months, to C$11.93. Shale-gas developer Questerre Energy Corp.
soared 18 percent to C$1.68.  Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
increased 0.9 percent to C$36.64 after  Greg M. Pardy , an analyst
at Royal Bank of Canada, raised his 12-month share-price
estimate to C$46 from C$43. On Dec. 17, Suncor announced the
C$1.75 billion ($1.72 billion) sale of stakes in two oil-sands
projects to Total SA.  The  S&P/TSX Financials Index  retreated for a fifth day, the
longest streak since June, as TD and BMO slipped.  TD dropped 2.3 percent to C$70.52 after the report that it
will buy Chrysler Financial, the lender once owned by automaker
Chrysler, as soon as tomorrow. The three people with knowledge
of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks
are private.  BMO Falls  BMO, Canada’s fourth-biggest bank, lost 2.4 percent to
C$56.60 after analysts at Cormark Securities Inc. and Barclays
Plc lowered their ratings on the shares.  John Aiken , the
Barclays analyst, told clients in a note that the M&I
acquisition “will dampen absolute and relative profitability
for several years.”  BMO sank 6.5 percent on Dec. 17 after announcing what would
be the third-largest purchase of a U.S. company by a Canadian
bank or insurer.  S&P/TSX gold stocks gained the most in two weeks as the
yield on Irish 10-year government bonds increased for a third
day and the euro retreated against 15 of 16 other major
currencies. On Dec. 17, Moody’s Investors Service cut Ireland’s
credit rating.  Barrick, Goldcorp  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
advanced 0.5 percent to C$52.65. Goldcorp increased for the
first time in seven days, climbing 1.4 percent to C$45.59.
Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd., Canada’s No. 5 producer by total
revenue, rallied 2.1 percent to C$78.04.  OceanaGold Corp., which mines in New Zealand, rose 8.6
percent to C$3.92 after  Ian Preston , an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., gave the company a “buy” rating in new coverage.  NovaGold Resources Inc., which is developing gold and base-
metals properties in Alaska and British Columbia, gained 6.1
percent to C$14.86. The company offered to buy Copper Canyon
Resources Ltd., which owns 40 percent of a NovaGold joint
venture, in a deal NovaGold valued at C$34.1 million.  Paramount Gold and Silver Corp., which explores for
precious metals in Mexico, jumped 19 percent to a record C$3.24.
The shares have surged 75 percent since Dec. 9, the day before
the company announced what it called “the most significant
discovery to date” at its San Miguel project.  Uranium One Inc., the uranium producer in which Moscow-
based ARMZ Uranium Holding is buying a controlling stake,
advanced 6.7 percent to $4.64.  Bart Jaworski , an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc.,
raised his rating on the stock to “outperform” from “market
perform.” In a note to clients, Jaworski cited recent share-
price declines and “increased geographical diversification.”  To contact the reporters on this story;
