Government bonds are falling the
most in a year as the gap between yields on longer-term
Treasuries show that the Federal Reserve’s second round of
quantitative easing may be its last.  The  difference  between 10- and 30-year yields shrank to
1.05 percentage points, or 105 basis points, on Dec. 15 from a
record 1.60 points on Nov. 10, the fastest contraction since the
1980s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shift in the
so-called yield curve is taking place as Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show U.S. bonds due in 10 years or more lost
4.64 percent this month, trimming 2010’s gain to 8.37 percent.  Flattening usually foreshadows the end of Fed interest-rate
cuts aimed at stimulating growth. U.S. reports this month showed
rising  retail sales , higher consumer confidence and a jump in
industrial production after the central bank expanded its
 balance sheet  to an unprecedented $2.39 trillion, pumping money
into the financial system. It’s adding $600 billion more
purchasing Treasuries through so-called quantitative easing to
keep the economy from deflating.  “A peak in the yield spread between 10s and 30s signals
the end of an easing cycle,” said  Steven Wieting , managing
director of economic and market analysis at Citigroup Inc.
“It’s part of a recovery and improved growth expectations. If
the outlook is for a stronger recovery, then QE would be limited
and they may not expand beyond it.”  Weaken the Dollar  While Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  and  John Boehner,  a
Republican from Ohio and the next speaker of the House of
Representatives, said Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke’s  policy
would weaken the greenback and add to instability, market
measures are signaling a strengthening economy with contained
inflation.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index has climbed 5.37 percent
this month, reaching a two-year high. Yields on speculative-
grade corporate bonds fell last week to within 5.4 percentage
points of Treasuries, the slimmest margin since November 2007.
The  U.S. Dollar Index  has appreciated 2.9 percent since Nov. 12,
the day the Fed began buying Treasuries.  Economists at New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised
their growth forecast this month for the first half of 2011 to
3.8 percent from 2.8 percent.  Bill Gross , who oversees the $250 billion Total Return
Fund, the world’s biggest bond fund, at Pacific Investment
Management Co. in Newport Beach, California, said in October
that asset purchases by the Fed probably mean the end of the 30-
year rally in bonds. The firm said in a  filing  with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington last week that
the fund may invest in equity-linked securities for the first
time since 2003.  Rising Yields  “We expect there can be additional growth in the
economy,” said  David Glocke , who manages about $171 billion as
head of taxable money-market investments at Vanguard Group Inc.
in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. “That’s contributing to the
flattening bias.”  Yields on 10-year notes rose one basis point last week to
3.33 percent. The price of the benchmark 2.625 percent note due
November 2020 fell 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face amount, to
94 2/32, BGCantor Market Data show. Yields on 30-year bonds
increased by the same amount, to 4.44 percent, as the 4.25
percent security due in November 2040 declined 1/8 to 96 27/32.  Ten-year notes yielded 3.34 percent and 30-year yields were
4.44 percent at 5:27 p.m. in New York.  Monthly Loss  Treasuries of all maturities have lost an average of 2.02
percent in December, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. The last time U.S. government debt fell more than this
month was in December 2009, when they tumbled 2.64 percent as
reports showed a slowdown in job losses and the Fed said
economic conditions had improved “modestly.”  The Fed said last month it will focus about 86 percent of
its purchases in notes due in 2.5 years to 10 years, making the
so-called long bond the security that most closely reflects
market sentiment in the yield curve, which plots Treasuries
rates from the shortest to the longest maturities.  Last week, the extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year
notes over 2-year debt reached the widest since February after
President  Barack Obama  extended tax cuts that are expected to
spur growth and increase deficits. The gap increased for a third
week, rising to 272 basis points on Dec. 17 from 268 basis
points on Dec. 10, according to Bloomberg data. The spread
touched 289 basis points on Dec. 15, the widest since Feb. 23.  The difference between 10- and 30-year yields is still more
than double the average of about 29 basis points over the past
three decades.  Fed History  In 1992, the  spread  peaked at 109 basis points in October,
a month after  Alan Greenspan ’s Fed cut the target rate for
overnight loans between banks to 3 percent. By the time the
central bank began raising borrowing costs in February 1994, the
curve had narrowed to about 46 basis points.  Then in 1998 the gap reached about 58 basis points one
month before the Fed reduced  rates  in November for the third
time that year. When the central bank started boosting its
target in June 1999, it was about 12 basis points. The
difference was 97 basis points in March 2004, three months
before the Fed tightened monetary policy for the first time
since 2000. The curve had completely flattened by the time the
Fed stopped in June 2006.  While a flatter yield curve signals shrinking concerns
about inflation, the rout in Treasuries may show increasing
realization that the improving U.S. economy is raising prices.  Inflation Measures  The Labor Department said Dec. 14 that wholesale costs rose
0.8 percent in November, the most in eight months, led by
increases in gasoline, heating oil and fruit. A day later it
said consumer prices excluding food and fuel jumped 0.8 percent
from a year earlier, matching the biggest increase since
September 2004.  “Bernanke has to be confident that for now we are avoiding
deflation,”  John Brynjolfsson,  who oversees about $362 million
of assets as chief investment officer at Aliso Viejo,
California-based hedge fund Armored Wolf LLC, said in a Dec. 15
interview on Bloomberg Television.  Quantitative easing will last through June as part of a
plan to “promote a stronger pace of economic recovery” and
keep prices stable “over time,” the Federal Open Market
Committee said in a statement Dec. 14.  Consumption Rises  The Commerce Department will say this week the core
personal consumption expenditures index, which strips out food
and energy costs, rose 0.9 percent in November from a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of 23 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The Fed has said it would prefer that
measure of inflation to increase at a 1.6 percent to 2 percent
rate.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities widened to 2.36 percentage points
on Dec. 16, up from 1.47 percent in August and the most since
May 4. The so-called break-even rate is the annual rate of
inflation that traders expect over the life of the bonds.  Employers added 39,000 jobs in November, after 172,000 the
prior month, Labor Department figures showed even as the jobless
rate rose to 9.8 percent, the highest since April.  “The important thing is increased economic growth,
decreased risk aversion, that’s all good for the economy,”
 Jeremy Siegel , a professor of finance at the University of
Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview on Dec. 14. “Interest rates from a historical
standpoint are still very low.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
