Incyte Corp.  gained in extended
Nasdaq trading after the drugmaker said its drug for the bone-
marrow disorder  myelofibrosis  met goals in the third and final
stage of studies generally required for approval.  Incyte  rose  as much as $1.12, or 7.4 percent, to $16.30 as
of 4:40 p.m. New York time in trading after the close of the
Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of the Wilmington, Delaware-based
company have increased 67 percent this year.  Incyte’s pill, called INCB18424, shrank spleen size by at
least 35 percent in 42 percent of patients in the study of 309
people, Incyte said today in a statement. That compared with
spleen reduction of at least that much in less than 1 percent of
patients on a placebo. Enlarged spleens are a symptom of the
disease, which can lead to acute myeloid leukemia and has an
average survival time of about five years to seven years.  “We are proceeding with the preparation of a New Drug
Application and believe INCB18424 has the potential to become
the first FDA-approved treatment for this debilitating, life-
threatening disease,” Incyte Chief Executive Officer  Paul Friedman  said in the statement.  Incyte, which has a partnership with Swiss drugmaker
 Novartis AG  for the medicine, said it plans to apply for the
drug’s approval in the second quarter of 2011. INCB18424 could
bring in $300 million in U.S. revenue from use in myelofibrosis
patients by 2017,  Joshua Schimmer , an analyst at Leerink Swann &
Co., estimated in September when the company reported earlier
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
