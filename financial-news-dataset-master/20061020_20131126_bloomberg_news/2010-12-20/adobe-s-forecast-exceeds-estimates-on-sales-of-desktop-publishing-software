Adobe Systems Inc. , the top maker of
graphic-design programs, forecast fiscal first-quarter profit
that exceeded  analysts’ estimates , bolstered by resurgent sales
of the company’s desktop-publishing software.  Excluding some costs, profit will be 54 cents to 59 cents a
share in the period ending in February, San Jose, California-
based Adobe said today in a statement. Analysts had  estimated  51
cents on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales  of Creative Suite 5, released in April, are
rebounding from a lull earlier in the year. Adobe had cited
lackluster back-to-school demand in September when it issued a
forecast that trailed analysts’ predictions. Creative Suite,
which includes the Photoshop and Illustrator programs, is used
by graphic designers, advertising agencies and schools.  “The rumors of the demise of CS5 were greatly
exaggerated,” said  Patrick Walravens , an analyst at JMP
Securities LLC in San Francisco. He has a “market outperform”
rating on Adobe’s stock.  Adobe rose $1.52, or 5.2 percent, to $30.65 in extended
trading. The  shares , down 21 percent this year, had closed at
$29.18 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Sales Forecast  The company targeted first-quarter  revenue  of $1 billion to
$1.05 billion.  Analysts  had predicted $991.9 million.  Creative Suite, which accounts for most of Adobe’s sales,
provides a surge of growth whenever a new version comes out. The
company is counting on the latest iteration to perform better
than CS4, which debuted in September 2008. At the time, the
financial crisis was deepening and corporations reined in
technology spending.  Adobe’s digital enterprise services also are helping spur
growth and lessen its reliance on Creative Suite, Walravens
said. That business helps manage correspondence with customers
and offers technology for reviewing and sharing documents.  “We’re definitely seeing this fast-growing trend for both
enterprises and governments to invest,” Chief Executive Officer
 Shantanu Narayen  said on a conference call.  In the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 3, Adobe earned 56
cents a share, topping the 52-cent estimate. Sales rose 33
percent to $1.01 billion. Analysts projected $988.3 million.  Net income  was $268.9 million, or 53 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $32 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier.  Apple Criticism  Earlier this month, Citigroup Inc.’s  Walter Pritchard 
estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of Creative Suite
customers had bought version 5. Larger companies may have been
waiting to upgrade, the San Francisco-based analyst said in a
report at the time.  Adobe’s rosy forecast caps a tumultuous year for the
company, which clashed with Apple Inc.’s  Steve Jobs  and later
spurred speculation that it may be acquired by Microsoft Corp.  Jobs, Apple’s CEO, banned Adobe’s Flash video software from
his company’s iPhone and iPad, saying it wasn’t well suited to
mobile devices.  Adobe  then won a partial victory on Sept. 9,
when Apple eased restrictions on creating applications for its
products.  Adobe is releasing a product called Flex that will work
around the restrictions imposed by Apple, Walravens said. It
lets developers make software for Apple’s mobile devices, as
well as those using  Google Inc. ’s Android operating system.
Apple’s ban hasn’t affected Adobe’s sales, Narayen said today.  The company faces a fresh challenge on Jan. 6, when Apple
plans to open an online storefront for Mac software. That would
give Apple a direct channel to customers -- unlike Adobe and
Microsoft, which rely more on consultants, retailers and
Internet merchants to sell their software.  Adobe’s stock surged in October after a report that
Microsoft CEO  Steve Ballmer  had met with Narayen to discuss
closer collaboration between the companies. The stock gave up
much of the gains the next day, after the meeting was described
as routine.  To contact the reporters on this story:
