Floods in Carnarvon damaged
vegetable and fruit crops after the town on the coast of Western
Australia received the equivalent of its yearly average rainfall
in one day.  “There’s extensive damage to grapes and vegetable crops,”
Jim Turley, executive officer with industry association
VegetablesWA, said in a phone interview today. Water melons,
bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and chilies may be affected,
he said, declining to give a financial estimate.  The town, 900 kilometers (560 miles) north of Perth, is
isolated by road due to heavy rain and more than 190 people have
gathered at a relocation center to escape flooding, the state’s
Fire & Emergency Services said in a  statement .  Carnarvon received 221 millimeters (8.7 inches) of rain in
24 hours on Dec. 17, almost equal to its yearly average rainfall
of 226 millimeters, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.
Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett said Nov. 30 the state
was suffering the driest year on record.  “This could be quite beneficial in the long run as it
could recharge the aquifer,” Turley said. “The area’s been
very short of water.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
