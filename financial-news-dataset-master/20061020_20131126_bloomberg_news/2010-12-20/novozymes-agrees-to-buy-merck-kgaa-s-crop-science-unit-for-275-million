Novozymes A/S  agreed to buy  Merck
KGaA ’s agricultural biotech unit for $275 million in a
transaction that will boost the Danish company’s presence in the
U.S. and South America.  The unit, called EMD/Merck Crop Bioscience Inc., will
contribute to Novozymes’ sales and profit targets, the
Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based enzyme producer said in a statement
today. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2011.  The takeover expands a business that Novozymes entered in
2007 with the  acquisition  of Philom Bios in Canada, the Danish
company said. Novozymes bought the Brazilian agricultural
microorganism maker Turfal in August.  “The acquisition strengthens our presence in the growing
field of agricultural biologicals,” Novozymes Chief Executive
Officer  Steen Riisgaard  said in the statement.  Novozymes rose 6 kroner to 769.50 kroner at 9:27 a.m. in
Copenhagen trading. Merck was little changed, trading at 60.15
euros in Frankfurt.  The Merck unit has grown an average of 15 percent each year
for the past seven years, with sales of $60 million expected
this year and earnings before interest and taxes “supportive of
Novozymes’ long-term expectations of more than 20 percent,” the
Danish company said.  Merck, based in Darmstadt, Germany, isn’t related to Merck
& Co. of Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
