Popular acceptance of Germany’s
renewable energy drive is likely to weaken when households see
the cost of subsidies in their power bills jump as much as
fourfold, the ZEW Center for European Economic Research said.  Households will pay 3.53 euro cents per kilowatt-hour of
consumed electricity in subsidies next year, up from 2.05 cents
in 2010, Germany’s four power transmission grid operators said
in October. One kilowatt-hour is enough to power a 100-watt
light bulb for 10 hours.  Some 45 percent of about 200 energy-industry officials
surveyed by Mannheim-based  ZEW  expect the price to rise to 4
cents to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour in five years, while 27
percent forecast a jump to 6 cents to 8 cents, the research
center said in an e-mailed statement today.  An increase to 4 cents to 6 cents would threaten support,
said about 30 percent of the respondents, while 24 percent
viewed 6 cents to 8 cents as the “critical” level. Fifteen
percent said even next year’s rate would be enough to weaken
acceptance, according to the ZEW statement.  German consumers guarantee operators of wind turbines,
solar panels and other renewable energy facilities fixed prices
for the electricity they generate. The government wants to boost
the share of renewable energy to at least 30 percent of gross
power output by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
