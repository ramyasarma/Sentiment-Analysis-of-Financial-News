The government will scrap plans for
a 30 billion-pound ($48 billion) tidal power project in the
Severn Estuary as part of its program of spending cuts, the
 Independent on Sunday  newspaper reported.  Energy Secretary Chris Huhne will announce the decision to
lawmakers tomorrow, saying the plan isn’t financially viable,
the newspaper reported, citing an unnamed government official.
The barrage, opposed by wildlife conservationists, could have
supplied as much as 5 percent of the U.K.’s electricity.  The government will still approve the construction of
nuclear power stations on eight sites in England and Wales near
existing reactors, and Huhne will announce financial support for
offshore wind-power turbines, the Independent said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
