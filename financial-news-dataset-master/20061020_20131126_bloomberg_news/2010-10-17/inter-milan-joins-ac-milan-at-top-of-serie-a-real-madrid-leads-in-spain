Lazio won 2-0 at Bari to take a two-
point lead over Inter Milan and AC Milan at the top of Italian
soccer’s Serie A.  Anderson Hernanes and  Sergio Floccari  scored second-half
goals yesterday for Lazio, which has 16 points from seven league
games. Both Milan teams have 14 points.  “We know that being ahead is not our rightful place,”
Floccari told reporters. “There are much better equipped and
more competitive teams but we’ll see game after game what our
true level is.”  A goal by  Samuel Eto’o  in the 39th minute clinched a 1-0
victory for Inter at Cagliari yesterday. Eto’o was subjected to
racist abuse early in the game and supporters were told the
match might be called off if the taunts continued.  AC Milan advanced to 14 points with a 3-1 home win over
Chievo two days ago, while Napoli has 12 points after a 1-1 draw
at Catania yesterday.  In Spain, Real Madrid leads the standings on 17 points
after a 4-1 win at Malaga two days ago. Barcelona is a point
behind after a 2-1 win over Valencia, which also has 16 points.
Villarreal, on 15 points, can go top if it wins at Hercules
today.  In Germany, Borussia Dortmund took over at the top of the
standings as Mainz two days ago suffered its first loss after
winning the first seven games. Dortmund, a 2-1 winner at Cologne
three days ago, has 21 points, with a better goal difference
than Mainz, a 1-0 loser at home to Hamburg two days ago.  Rennes leads the French standings by two points after a 0-0
draw at Lens yesterday. In the Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven leads
Ajax by a point after a 4-2 win at Willem II yesterday. Ajax
beat NAC Breda 3-0 two days ago.  WEEKEND RESULTS
