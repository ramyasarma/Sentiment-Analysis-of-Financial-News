Qatar Islamic Bank SAQ, the Persian
gulf country’s biggest shariah-compliant lender, posted a 62
percent rise in third-quarter profit, missing analyst estimates,
amid a pickup in economic growth in the emirate.  Net income rose to 305.4 million riyals ($83.9 million)
from 188.5 million riyals a year earlier, according to  Bloomberg
News calculations  based on the bank’s nine-month earnings today.
Analysts had expected a profit of 344.7 million riyals,
according to the mean estimate of three surveyed by Bloomberg.  Qatar’s economy will expand by 19 percent this year, double
the growth rate in 2009 and faster than any other economy,
according to  International Monetary Fund  projections. Customer
deposits in banks rose 23 percent in August compared with the
same period a year earlier, while the value of loans increased
19 percent, according to data from the  country’s central bank .  “During 2010, QIB adopted a strategic plan to remain
innovative while overcoming the effects that the global
financial crisis had on the region,” Chairman Jassim Bin Hamad
Al-Thani said in the statement. The “results demonstrate that
QIB is moving closer to achieving the goals set forth by our
Board of Directors.”  The shares fell 2.1 percent to 80.1 riyals on the Qatar
Exchange today, before the results were published. The stock has
 gained 2.8 percent this year .  Qatar Islamic’s nine-month profit fell to 907 million
riyals, the bank said. Third-quarter earnings were calculated by
subtracting first-half profit from the nine-month figure. The
bank reported a nine-month profit of 1 billion riyals in 2009.  Nine-month operating income was 1.7 billion riyals, the
bank said. The value of assets rose to 44.8 billion riyals at
the end of September from 35.6 billion riyals a year earlier.  Chief Executive Officer  Salah Al Jaida  said earlier this
month he would step down for personal reasons. He will be
retained as an adviser, the bank said earlier this month. Qatar
Islamic is yet to name his full-time successor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
