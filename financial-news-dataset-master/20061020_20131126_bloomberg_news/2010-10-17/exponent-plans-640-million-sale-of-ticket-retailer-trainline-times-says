Exponent Private Equity LLP is
preparing to sell the Trainline, a British online rail-ticket
seller, for as much as 400 million pounds ($640 million), the
Sunday Times said, without saying where it got the information.  Exponent bought the Trainline from Richard Branson’s Virgin
Group Ltd. for 160 million pounds in 2007. The website’s sales
rose by 7.5 percent to 793 million pounds last year, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
