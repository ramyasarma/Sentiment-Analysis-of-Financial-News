New Zealand inflation accelerated in
the third quarter, led by increased government charges on
tobacco and energy introduced ahead of an Oct. 1 increase in the
nation’s sales tax.  Consumer prices rose 1.1 percent from the second quarter,
Statistics New Zealand said in Wellington today. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists was for a 1
percent gain. Annual inflation gained 1.5 percent, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
