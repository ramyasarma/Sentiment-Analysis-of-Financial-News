Apax Partners and Guardian Media
Group plan a strategic review of Trader Media Group, the owner
of Auto Trader magazine, which may lead to a 2 billion-pound
($3.2 billion) sale or initial public offering, the Sunday
Telegraph reported.  The sale or offering may begin as early as next year, the
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.
Trader Media may also take out new loans to pay its owners a
dividend under one option being considered, the newspaper said.  A Guardian Media Group spokesman said no decisions have
been made about its investment in Trader Media Group, the
Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
