Sheila Bair , chairwoman of the
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said she doesn’t support a
national freeze on foreclosures.  Bair said on C-Span’s “Newsmakers” program that the
processing of foreclosures needed to be reviewed after
allegations some banks acted illegally to seize homes. Once the
assessment was completed valid foreclosures should go forward,
Bair said.  “It’s tragic. I don’t like it, but the market has to
clear,” Bair said. “If a family simply can’t afford to make a
modified payment, then something else has to happen. I regret
it, but that’s just the way the system has to work.”  She said banks should do an internal assessment of the risk
the issue poses to their balance sheets.  “We need to get a full handle on all of this,” Bair said.  Attorneys general from all 50 states are conducting a joint
investigation into whether lenders used false documents to
justify foreclosures.  President  Barack Obama  and the agencies that share
oversight responsibility have argued a national foreclosure
freeze would do further harm to the housing market and the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
