Japan and the U.S. scrapped plans to
sign a security declaration during U.S. President Barack Obama’s
visit next month because of a dispute over the relocation of an
American military base, the Daily Yomiuri reported.  The declaration was to cover regional and global security
cooperation, the report said, citing unidentified diplomatic
sources.  Ties between the countries have soured during the past year
because of a dispute over whether to move a U.S. Marine facility
off the southern island of Okinawa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
