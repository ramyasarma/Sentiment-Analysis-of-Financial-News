U.K. dividends returned to growth in
the third quarter as company balance sheets improved and the
economy began to recover from the worst recession since World
War II, data from Capita Registrars showed.  Company payouts grew 1.6 percent from a year earlier to
17.6 billion pounds ($28.2 billion) in the three months through
September, the first increase since the first quarter of 2009,
according to the Capita Registrars Dividend Monitor. Dividends
grew even after  BP Plc  canceled its 1.8 billion-pound
shareholder payout during the period, the report said.  “An overwhelming majority of companies are now raising
payments,”  Charles Cryer , chief executive officer of Capita
Registrars, said in an e-mailed statement today. “Investors can
finally breathe a sigh of relief after a long and painful period
of shrinking dividends.”  Excluding BP, which scrapped its  dividend  following an
explosion at its Macondo oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico that led
to the world’s largest accidental oil spill, third-quarter
dividends rose 13 percent, the biggest increase since the first
quarter of 2008.  The Capita report is based on data provided by Exchange
Data International.  To contact the reporters on this story:
