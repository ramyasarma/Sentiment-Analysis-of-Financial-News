Sumitomo Corp.  and  Korea Electric
Power Corp.  won priority negotiation rights for the construction
and operations of a power plant in the United Arab Emirates.  The gas-fired power plant, with a capacity of about 1,600
megawatts, will be built in Shuweihat and is scheduled to begin
operation in 2013, Sumitomo spokesman Kazuho Enaka said by
phone.  Sumitomo will likely hold a larger stake than Kepco in the
150 billion yen ($1.8 billion) project, Nikkei English News
reported without citing anyone. Enaka declined to comment on
Sumitomo’s stake and the project cost.  Kim Hye Lim, a spokeswoman at Kepco, declined to comment.  The contract will be awarded by the  Abu Dhabi Water and
Electricity Authority .  To contact the reporters on this story:
