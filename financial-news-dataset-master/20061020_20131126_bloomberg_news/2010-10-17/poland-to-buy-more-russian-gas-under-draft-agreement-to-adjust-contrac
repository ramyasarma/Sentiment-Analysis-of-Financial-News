Poland reached a preliminary
agreement with Russia on adjusting a gas contract to make it
compatible with European Union law and said in a statement today
gas supplies were not threatened.  Poland reached an accord with Russian gas monopoly  OAO
Gazprom  in January, although the contract wasn’t signed after
the European Commission said it was assessing whether the deal
was in line with EU regulation, including issues related to the
pipeline’s management, access to third parties and tariffs.  Representatives of the two countries discussed the deal in
Moscow today, with the EC acting as a legal adviser.  “The parties agreed the text of an intergovernmental
accord,” Poland’s Economy Ministry said in a statement, adding
that the agreement will be initialed after negotiations finish
between EuRoPolGaz SA, which manages the Yamal pipeline, and
Gaz-System SA, the Polish pipeline operator.  The deal will raise annual deliveries of natural gas to
Poland to as much as 10.2 billion cubic meters from about 7.4
billion. The increase will cover a supply gap after one of the
country’s transit sources halted last year and will help secure
supply from the Yamal pipeline.  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA , Poland’s
dominant gas company, said on Sept. 20 that under the existing
annual arrangements, its supplies may not be enough to meet
demand beyond October.  “There is no risk of disruptions in natural gas supplies to
Poland,” the ministry said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
