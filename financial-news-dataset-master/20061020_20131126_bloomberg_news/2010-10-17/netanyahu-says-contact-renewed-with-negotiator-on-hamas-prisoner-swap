Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu 
said Israel renewed contact “a few weeks ago,” with a German
mediator negotiating with Hamas for the return of an Israeli
soldier held captive in the Gaza Strip for more than four years.  “We are consistently acting on  Gilad Shalit ’s behalf, in
different and varied ways, to bring him home,” Netanyahu said
in an interview with Israel Army Radio. “One of these ways, a
central one, is the negotiations that resumed a few weeks ago.”  Netanyahu’s comments confirmed a report yesterday in the
London-based daily Al-Hayat that said a mediator had met with
Hamas and Israeli officials.  Shalit was seized by Hamas militants in an attack on an
Israeli army outpost on the border with Gaza in June 2006. Egypt
and Germany have been trying to broker a prisoner exchange. The
only contact between Shalit, who holds Israeli and French
citizenship, and the outside world during his captivity has been
three letters, an audio tape and a DVD that Israel received last
October in return for releasing 20 female Palestinian prisoners.  To contact the reporters on this story:
