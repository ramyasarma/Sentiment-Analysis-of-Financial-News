Padraig Harrington  won his first
golf title in two years, finishing three shots clear of Noh
Seung-yul at the Johor Open in Malaysia. Richard Green took the
Portugal Masters title.  Ireland’s Harrington, who  hadn’t won since  claiming his
third major at the U.S. PGA Championship in 2008, finished on
20-under-par at the Horizon Hills Golf and Country Club. He
carded a 69 in the final round.  “I would have to say that things went my way all four
rounds this week,” The 39-year-old Harrington told the British
Broadcasting Corp.’s website. “There is no doubt about it -- it
was my week to win.”  South Korea’s Noh hit a 65 today to claim second place, one
shot ahead of Taiwan’s Lin Wen-tang. Europe’s victorious Ryder
Cup captain  Colin Montgomerie  shared 11th spot on 10-under.  Australia’s Green won in Portugal by two strokes, finishing
on 18-under par after a final-round 65. Italy’s Francesco
Molinari, Sweden’s  Robert Karlsson , Spain’s  Gonzalo Fernandez- Castano  and Joost Luiten of the Netherlands tied for second.  It was the 39-year-old Green’s third European Tour victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
