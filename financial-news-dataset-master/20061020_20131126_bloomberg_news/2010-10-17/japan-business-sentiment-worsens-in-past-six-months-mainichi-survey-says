Japan’s corporate leaders are more
pessimistic about their prospects compared with six months ago
as the rising yen erodes overseas sales, according to a Mainichi
newspaper  survey  published today.  The business climate is “gradually worsening,” according
to 17 percent of the 119 responses to questionnaires sent to the
chairman or president of companies such as  Toyota Motor Corp. ,
 Cannon Inc.  and  Sony Corp. , the newspaper said. None of the
managers said the overall climate was deteriorating in the same
survey in April.  At the same time, 64 percent said the climate was “flat,”
compared with 37 percent in April. Eighteen percent said the
situation was gradually improving, down from 61 percent in the
previous poll.  Asked what they hoped Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  will do to
stimulate the economy, 78 companies responded that he should cut
corporate taxes. The Mainichi conducted today’s poll between
September and October.  The yen reached 80.88 against the dollar on Oct. 15, the
strongest since April 1995. Japan’s currency has climbed 14
percent against the U.S. currency this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
