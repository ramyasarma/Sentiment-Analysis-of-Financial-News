FIFA, soccer’s governing body, said
it has asked the London-based Sunday Times newspaper to provide
“all of the information and documents related” to a report in
connection with the voting process for the 2018 and 2022 World
Cup bids.  “FIFA will immediately analyse the material available and
only once this analysis has concluded will FIFA be able to
decide on any potential next steps,” the organization said in
an e-mailed statement today.  FIFA said its ethics committee has closely monitored the
bidding process for the two events.  To contact the reporter on this story:
