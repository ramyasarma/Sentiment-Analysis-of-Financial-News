Dexus Wholesale Property Fund bought
13 Australian industrial properties with tenants including
Mercedes-Benz and Fairfax Media Ltd. for A$231 million ($229
million) and signaled plans to sell as much as A$500 million in
shares.  The purchase from Colonial First State Investment Ltd.’s
Direct Property Investment Fund will initially be funded with
debt and covers eight properties in Sydney, three in Melbourne
and two in Brisbane, Sydney-based Dexus Wholesale said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Dexus Wholesale, an unlisted trust that oversees about
A$3.15 billion in assets and is managed by Dexus Property Group,
said the portfolio will have an initial yield of 9 percent and
increases the fund’s allocation of industrial properties to
about 11 percent from 4 percent. The fund will seek to sell at
least A$300 million of shares later this month to new and
existing investors and may sell as much as A$500 million.  “Our objective is to increase DWPF’s portfolio allocation
to industrial property to between 10 percent and 20 percent,”
Fund Manager Graham Pearson said in the statement.  Proceeds from the share sale will be allocated to the
fund’s “development pipeline and to enhance the portfolio
quality as well as to maintain gearing within the fund long-term
target range of 10 percent to 20 percent,” the statement said.
After the acquisition, the fund’s allocation will be 11 percent
industrial, 57 percent retail and 32 percent office properties.  “By making the acquisition at a low-point of the valuation
cycle and holding the properties for the long-term we are able
to enhance returns to investors,” Pearson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
