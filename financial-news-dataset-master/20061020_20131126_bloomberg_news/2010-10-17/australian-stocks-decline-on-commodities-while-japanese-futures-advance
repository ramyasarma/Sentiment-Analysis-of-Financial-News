Australian stocks fell after
commodity prices declined, while Japanese stock futures rose.  Newcrest Mining Ltd., Australia’s largest gold producer,
slumped 1.6 percent in Sydney as the price of the metal dropped.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s No. 2 oil and gas producer,
lost as much as 0.3 percent after crude prices retreated  on Oct.
15. American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co., a Japanese
carmaker that makes more than 80 percent of its sales abroad,
rose 0.6 percent from the last closing share price in Tokyo.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  slid 0.1 percent today. New
Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  climbed 0.3 percent in Wellington.
Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in December
closed at 9,560 in Chicago on Oct. 15, compared with 9,520 in
Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,550 in Osaka,
Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time today.  “The stock market will likely trade sideways,” said
 Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Co.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. The index rose 0.2 percent on Oct. 15 in New York as
companies such as  Google Inc.  fueled a rally in technology
shares that helped offset a decline in bank shares and an
unexpected drop in consumer confidence.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has risen 8.8 percent this year
on speculation growth in corporate profits will weather Europe’s
debt crisis, Chinese steps to curb property-price inflation and
concern about the pace of the U.S. economic rebound. Stocks in
the gauge trade at 14.3 times estimated profit on average,
compared with 14 times for the  S&P 500  and 12.2 times for the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  Crude oil for November delivery declined 1.7 percent on Oct.
15 in New York to $81.25 a barrel, the lowest settlement this
month. The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including
aluminum and copper slipped 0.4 percent on Oct. 15, the biggest
drop since Oct. 7. The  Baltic Dry Index  of shipping rates for
commodities fell for the first time in four days on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporters for this story:
