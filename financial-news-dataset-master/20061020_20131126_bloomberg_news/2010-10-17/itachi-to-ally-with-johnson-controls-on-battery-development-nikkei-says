Hitachi Ltd. will partner with U.S.
auto supplier Johnson Controls Inc. in the auto-battery
business, Nikkei English News said, without citing anyone.  The companies may set up a joint venture to handle research
and development, and sales of lithium-ion and other batteries,
the report said.  The companies plan to build plants in the U.S., Europe and
Asia if their alliance leads to major contracts with automakers,
the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
