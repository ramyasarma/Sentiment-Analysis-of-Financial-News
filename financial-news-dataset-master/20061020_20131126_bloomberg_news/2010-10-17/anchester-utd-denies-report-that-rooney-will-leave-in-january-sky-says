Manchester United said a report
today that England striker  Wayne Rooney  will be sold by the
Premier League soccer club in January is “nonsense,” Sky
Sports said.  The Sunday Mirror said talks between the club and Rooney,
24, over a new contract have broken down and he will leave in
the next so-called transfer window following “explosive rows”
with manager Alex Ferguson. He’ll be sold for a transfer fee of
50 million pounds ($80 million), it added.  “To suggest Wayne Rooney will be sold in January is
nonsense,” Sky Sports cited a club spokesman, whom it did not
name, as saying today.  Ferguson and Rooney have clashed over reported allegations
about the player’s private life and his recent omission from the
team,  the newspaper said .  Rooney recently denied his manager’s assertion that he was
struggling with an ankle injury after playing for England in a
European Championship qualifier against Montenegro last week. He
was only a substitute in United’s 2-2 draw against West Bromwich
Albion yesterday.  Barcelona and Real Madrid would be interested in signing
Rooney, while United’s rivals Chelsea and Manchester City could
offer him options in the Premier League, according to the
Mirror.  Manchester United spokesman  Philip Townsend  didn’t
immediately respond to voice messages from Bloomberg News
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
