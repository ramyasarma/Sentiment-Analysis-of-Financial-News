Hedge funds cut their bullish bets
on natural gas to the lowest level this year as expanding
stockpiles drove prices to a 13-month low.  The funds and other large speculators cut wagers on rising
prices by 36 percent in the seven days ended Oct. 12, according
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments
of Traders report. It was the third week of declines, bringing
the reduction since Sept. 21 to 71 percent.  “If somebody looks at fundamentals and sees how much we
have in the ground right now, I couldn’t blame them for
selling,” said  Hamza Khan , an analyst at the Schork Group Inc.,
a consulting company in Villanova, Pennsylvania.  Natural gas has fallen 38 percent this year as U.S.
stockpiles swelled amid rising production from shale deposits
and demand failed to accelerate following the recession. An
inventory surplus has expanded as air-conditioning use tapers
off after summer before demand for winter heating fuel rises.  Contracts for November delivery fell 10.4 cents, or 2.9
percent, to settle at $3.431 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level since
Sept. 15, 2009.  The surplus grew for a third week in the seven days ended
Oct. 8, the Energy Department said Oct. 14.  Stockpiles  rose by
91 billion cubic feet to 3.59 trillion cubic feet, 7.4 percent
above  the five-year average  and up from 6.7 percent the previous
week.  Gas Rigs  The number of  U.S. rigs  climbed 34 percent in the past year
to 966 the week ended Oct. 15, up from 721 a year ago, according
to data published by Baker Hughes Inc.  Gas output will average 61.29 billion cubic feet a day this
year, up from the 61.21 billion estimated in September, the
Energy Department said on Oct. 13 in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Production will be 2.2 percent higher than last
year. U.S. gas inventories will peak by the end of this month at
3.726 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department said.  Production from so-called shale formations rose 71 percent
in 2008 from a year earlier to 2.02 trillion cubic feet,
according to government data. Shale gas will account for 34
percent of total production in 2035, compared with 18 percent in
2008, Energy Department estimates show. The increased output has
cut the need for imports of liquefied natural gas from places
such as the Gulf state of Qatar.  “With better technology and all this shale gas, what you
see is an immense amount of drilling and that’s adding to the
inventories,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Milder Temperatures  A milder-than-normal U.S. winter may not produce enough
demand to reduce the surplus, weighing on prices, Lipow said.  U.S. temperatures are likely to be higher on average this
winter, with 6 percent to 7 percent fewer heating degree days
than a year earlier, according to an Oct. 13 forecast from the
U.S. Climate Prediction Center.  Declining prices convinced producers to curb output, Khan
said. Producers and merchants  decreased  net-short positions in
the Nymex natural gas future to 16,008 in the seven days ended
Oct. 12, from 20,638 the week ended Oct. 5, according to the
CFTC, indicating that producers sold fewer contracts to deliver
the fuel, he said.  “Producers are less willing to hedge prices at these
levels, but it’s too little, too late,” Khan said. “At a
certain point, Wall Street will ignore the fundamentals and use
the trend-is-your-friend principal. If everyone else is selling,
you’re selling.”  Futures Contracts  Hedge funds and other large speculators cut net-long
positions in futures and options combined in four natural-gas
contracts by  11,445  futures equivalents to 20,034 in the week
ended Oct. 12, the lowest level this year, the CFTC data showed.  The measure of natural-gas net longs includes an index of
four contracts adjusted to futures equivalents: Nymex natural
gas futures, Nymex Henry Hub Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate
Swaps, and ICE Henry Hub Swaps. Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana,
is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark price for
the fuel.  Net-long positions  in oil held by what the CFTC categorizes
as managed money, including hedge funds, commodity pools and
commodity-trading advisers, rose by 10,198 futures and options
combined to 178,738, according to the CFTC report.  Bullish bets  on gasoline prices rose 6,351 futures and
options combined to 56,705, the sixth straight weekly increase,
the data showed.  Net-long positions  on  heating oil  declined
6,324, or 12 percent, to 46,375.  To contact the reporter on this story:
