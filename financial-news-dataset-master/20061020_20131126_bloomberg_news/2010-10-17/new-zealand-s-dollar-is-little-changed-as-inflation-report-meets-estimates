New Zealand’s dollar was little
changed after a government report showed consumer prices
increases 1.1 percent in the third quarter, compared with
economists’ estimates for a 1 percent advance.  The New Zealand currency traded at 75.54 U.S. cents as of
10:48 a.m. in Wellington, from 75.43 cents before the report and
75.62 cents on Oct. 15 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
