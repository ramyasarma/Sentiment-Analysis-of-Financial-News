Pittsburgh beat the Cleveland Browns
28-10 on quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s return for the
Steelers after a four-week National Football League suspension.  Roethlisberger sat out wins against Atlanta, Tennessee and
Tampa Bay and a home loss to Baltimore two weeks ago after his
initial six-week ban was cut by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.
The 28-year-old Roethlisberger was sanctioned for a violation of
the NFL’s personal conduct policy after being accused of
sexually assaulting two women. Roethlisberger denied the
accusations and no criminal charges were brought against him.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
