Peacock Group Plc , a U.K. clothing
retailer, has been put up for sale at a reduced price and has
drawn two bids of about 500 million pounds ($800 million) from
leveraged buyout firms, the Sunday Times reported.  Peacock’s owners, hedge funds Perry Capital LLC and Och-
Ziff Capital Management Group LLC, abandoned a sale two weeks
ago that valued the retailer at 600 million pounds, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information. The
Times didn’t identify the LBO firm bidders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
