Cody Ross hit a pair of solo home
runs and Tim Lincecum outpitched Roy Halladay as the San
Francisco Giants defeated the host Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 in
the opening game of the National League Championship Series.  Halladay, who threw a no-hitter in the Phillies’ three-game
sweep of the Cincinnati Reds in the NL Division Series, allowed
four runs on eight hits in seven innings. Lincecum gave up three
runs on six hits in seven innings.  Game 2 of the series is tomorrow night in Philadelphia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
