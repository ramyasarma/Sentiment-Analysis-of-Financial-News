Rutgers University defensive lineman
Eric LeGrand is paralyzed from the neck down after suffering a
spinal cord injury two days ago during a 23-20 overtime win
against Army.  LeGrand, a 20-year-old junior, had surgery to stabilize his
spine on Oct. 16 at Hackensack University Medical Center in
Hackensack, New Jersey, the school said in a  statement . He will
remain in the hospital’s intensive care unit, the school said
without elaborating.  “Eric, his family and the Rutgers football family believe
he will recover,” Rutgers coach  Greg Schiano  said in a
statement. LeGrand’s family said in a statement that “Eric is
in good spirits and we are praying for a full recovery.”  LeGrand was injured during a fourth-quarter kickoff return
at New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. He
lay motionless on the ground before being taken off on a
stretcher as players from both teams knelt in prayer.  A native of Avenel, New Jersey, LeGrand appeared in all six
games for the 4-2 Scarlet Knights this season. He had seven
tackles, was credited with half a sack and also had a fumble
recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
