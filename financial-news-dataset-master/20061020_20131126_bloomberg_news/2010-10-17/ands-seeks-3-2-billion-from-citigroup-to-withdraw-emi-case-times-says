Guy Hands  is asking  Citigroup Inc. 
to cut 2 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) from  EMI Group Ltd.’s 
debt in exchange for withdrawing his lawsuit against the bank,
the Sunday Times said.  Hands, founder of London-based buyout firm Terra Firma
Capital Partners Ltd., is asking Citigroup to take a minority
stake in the music recording and publishing company in return
for writing down its 3 billion-pound debt by two thirds, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information. The
case is due to start in a New York court tomorrow.  The private equity firm alleges it was misled by New York-
based Citigroup into believing that Cerberus Capital Management
LP was also bidding for EMI, which tricked them into overpaying
for their 4 billion-pound purchase in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
