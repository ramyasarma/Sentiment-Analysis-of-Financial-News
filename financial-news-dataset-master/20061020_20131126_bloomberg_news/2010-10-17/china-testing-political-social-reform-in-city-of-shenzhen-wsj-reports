China is experimenting with reform
in Shenzhen by giving some responsibility for social problems to
independent civic organizations, the Wall Street Journal
reported without citing anyone.  The move illustrates debate in the Communist Party as it
holds its annual meeting in Beijing. The party is using Shenzhen
to seek ways to strengthen oversight of local governments and
cut corruption, the WSJ said.  The experiment is considered by some to be a way to keep
authoritarian rule while responding to the needs of society, the
paper reported, without citing a source. At the head of the plan
is the leader of a nongovernmental organization that teaches
children of migrant workers, the WSJ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
