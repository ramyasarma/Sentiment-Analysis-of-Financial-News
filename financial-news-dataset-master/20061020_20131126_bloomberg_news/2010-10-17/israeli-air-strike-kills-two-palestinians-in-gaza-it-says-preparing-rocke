An Israeli air strike on the Hamas-
controlled Gaza Strip early this morning killed two
Palestinians, Adham Abu Selmeya, head of medical services in
Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry said.  The men were preparing to fire rockets into southern
Israel, the Israeli military said in an e-mailed statement. Two
other Palestinians were moderately wounded in the air strike,
Selmeya said by phone.  More than 165 rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel
this year, according to the army statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
