India delayed selling shares in MMTC
Ltd. to the financial year starting April 1 because of a spate
of public issues scheduled in the second half of this business
year, Press Trust of India reported, citing a finance ministry
official it didn’t identify.  The government, which owns 99.33 percent of MMTC, plans to
raise 400 billion rupees selling shares in state-run companies
in the year ending March, the report said. It has garnered more
than 20 billion rupees so far by divesting stake in Satluj Jal
Vidyut Nigam Ltd. and Engineers India Ltd., the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
