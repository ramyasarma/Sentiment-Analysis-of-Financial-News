Saudi Arabia’s  shares  rose the most
in almost a month as investors bought shares of petrochemical
companies in anticipation of better-than-expected earnings from
Saudi Basic Industries Corp.  Sabic , the world’s biggest petrochemical maker, gained the
most since July 10 before reporting a 46 percent increase in
third-quarter earnings after markets closed.  Astra Industrial
Group , a company with interests in pharmaceutical, chemical and
fertilizers, climbed 2.2 percent, after third-quarter profit
rose. Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co. added 3.1 percent. The
 Tadawul All Share Index  snapped four days of losses, rising 0.5
percent, the most since Sept. 20, to 6,260.55 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Riyadh. Most Middle East markets were little changed.  “Investors took advantage of the selloff, seeing recent
pullbacks as overdone ahead of Sabic’s results,” said  Amro Halwani , a trader at Shuaa Capital PSC in Saudi Arabia.  The Tadawul declined 3 percent in the previous four trading
days. Sabic rose 2.3 percent to 89 riyals, paring the decline
for the month to 0.8 percent. Net income advanced to 5.33
billion riyals ($1.42 billion) from 3.65 billion riyals a year
earlier. The median of five analyst estimates was for a profit
of 4.63 billion riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Astra increased to 42.4 riyals. The company yesterday
posted a 49 percent increase in third-quarter profit to 80.6
million riyals. Yansab, a unit of Sabic, jumped to 39.5 riyals.
The company last week reported net income of 356.2 million
riyals for the period after a loss a year earlier.  U.A.E. Markets  In the United Arab Emirates, the  DFM General Index 
retreated 0.1 percent to 1,744.46 as 12 stocks fell, seven rose
and 13 were unchanged. The benchmark index has gained 19 percent
so far in the second half of the year.  Abu Dhabi’s measure 
increased 0.2 percent, bringing the advance in the second half
to 9.9 percent.  “Investors are waiting at the sidelines as they anticipate
third-quarter results,” said  Haissam Arabi , chief executive
officer of Gulfmena Alternative Investments in Dubai. “There’s
a little profit-taking. But we expect the recent rally to
continue.”  Crude for November delivery fell 1.7 percent to $81.25 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Oct. 15 after a
strengthening U.S. dollar curbed the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Oman’s  MSM30 Index  and  Qatar’s measure  lost 0.1 percent,
while Bahrain’s  gauge  rose 0.1 percent. The  Kuwait SE Price
Index  increased 0.3 percent. In North Africa, Egypt’s  EGX 30
Index  slipped 0.1 percent.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index  fell 0.2 percent to 1,254.60. The
country’s benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit government bond
due January 2020 dropped for a fourth day, pushing the yield 3
basis points higher to 4.37 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
