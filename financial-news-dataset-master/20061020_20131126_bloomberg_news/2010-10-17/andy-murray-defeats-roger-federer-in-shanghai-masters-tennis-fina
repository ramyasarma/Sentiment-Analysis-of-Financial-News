Andy Murray beat  Roger Federer  in
straight sets to win tennis’s Shanghai Masters, his second title
this year.  Scotland’s Murray,  ranked No. 4  by the ATP Tour, won 6-3,
6-2 to improve his career record against Switzerland’s Federer
to eight victories in 13 meetings  “I served great, especially when I was behind in the
games,” Murray told the ATP Tour’s website. “I hit the ball
well from the back of the court. Against Roger you have to go
after it early.”  Murray, 23, collects a check for $616,500 after taking his
sixth Masters title. The 29-year-old Federer, who will climb to
No. 2 in the rankings for reaching the final, had been
attempting to tie top-ranked  Rafael Nadal  on 18 Masters titles.  Murray broke Federer in the opening game of the match, and
again in game nine, sealing the set with a crosscourt pass.  The Scot had to save break points in his first two service
games of the second set, before securing his own break in the
fourth game. Murray then took three of the next four games.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s  Tamarine Tanasugarn  beat Kimiko Date-
Krumm 7-5, 6-7 (4-7), 6-1 to win the Japan Open.  Japan’s Date-Krumm was attempting to become the first 40-
year-old to win a WTA Tour title. The record for the oldest
champion is held by Billie Jean King, who won a 1983 event at
age 39 years, 7 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
