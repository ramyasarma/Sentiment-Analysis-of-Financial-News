The New York Giants beat the Detroit
Lions 28-20 in Week 6 of the National Football League.  The win for the Giants (4-2) at the New Meadowlands Stadium
in East Rutherford, New Jersey, ended the team’s almost 20-year
wait for a home win against the Lions (1-5), whose losing run on
the road now extends to 24 games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
