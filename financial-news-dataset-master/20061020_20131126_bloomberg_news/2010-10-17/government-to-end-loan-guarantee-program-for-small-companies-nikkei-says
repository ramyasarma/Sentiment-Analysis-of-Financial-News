Japan will end a program that
provides a full guarantee on loans taken out by small and
midsize businesses at the end of March, Nikkei English News
said, without citing anyone.  The program was introduced in October 2008 and was extended
for 12 months in March this year, the report said.  After the program ends, the government will continue to
fully guarantee loans of up to 12.5 million yen to companies
with 20 employees or less, the report said. The state-backed
Japan Finance Corp. will also expand direct lending to small
firms, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
