Dubai shares declined for a second
day on concern companies in the emirate will report lower-than-
expected third-quarter earnings and after oil tumbled to the
lowest level in two weeks.  Emaar Properties PJSC,  builder of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, led the decline and  Arabtec Holding Co.  slipped 1.8
percent. The  DFM General Index  retreated 0.1 percent to 1,744.46
as 12 stocks fell, seven rose and 13 were unchanged. The
benchmark index closed at the lowest since Oct. 12. The index
has gained 19 percent so far in the second half of the year.
Most other Middle East markets were little changed.  “Investors are waiting at the sidelines as they anticipate
third-quarter results,” said  Haissam Arabi , chief executive
officer of Gulfmena Alternative Investments in Dubai. “There’s
a little profit-taking. But we expect the recent rally to
continue.”  Southern Province Cement Co.,  the largest cement producer
in Saudi Arabia, yesterday posted a 16 percent decline in third-
quarter profit. The shares retreated 1.9 percent to 64 riyals.
 Al-Khalij Holding,  the Qatari holding company, said on Oct. 14
its nine-month profit dropped 46 percent to 33.5 million riyals
($9.2 million). The shares fell 2.7 percent to 14.4 riyals in
Doha trading.  Crude Oil Drops  Crude for November delivery fell 1.7 percent to $81.25 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Oct. 15 after a
strengthening U.S. dollar curbed the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Emaar fell as much as 1.5 percent to 3.88 dirhams and
closed at 3.92 dirhams. Arabtec may report a 42 percent decline
in third-quarter profit to 97 million dirhams ($26.4 million),
according to the mean estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey. The shares dropped to 2.24 dirhams, the lowest
level since Oct. 7.  Emirates NBD PJSC,  the U.A.E.’s biggest bank by assets, may
report next week third-quarter net income fell 17 percent to 875
million dirhams, according to the mean estimate of two analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Oman’s  MSM30 Index  and  Qatar’s measure  lost 0.1 percent.  Abu
Dhabi’s measure  increased 0.2 percent and Bahrain’s  gauge  rose
0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index was little
changed, while the  Kuwait SE Price Index  increased 0.3 percent.
In North Africa, Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index  was little changed.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index  surged to the highest intraday on
record, rising as much as 0.4 percent to 1,262.56. The gauge
closed at a record on Oct. 14. The country’s benchmark 5 percent
Mimshal Shiklit government bond due January 2020 dropped,
pushing the yield 6 basis points higher to 4.40 percent.  -- With assistance from  David Wainer  in Tel Aviv. Editors:  Digby Lidstone ,  Claudia Maedler .  To contact the reporter on this story:
