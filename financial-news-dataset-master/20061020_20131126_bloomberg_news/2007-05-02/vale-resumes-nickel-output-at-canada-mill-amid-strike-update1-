             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce , the world's
largest producer of iron-ore, said it resumed nickel production
at the Voisey's Bay mine in  Canada  after contractors replaced
workers who went on strike last week.  
 A dispute with 100 union workers employed by two contractors
at the mine in Labrador forced Vale to shut its mill for about a
week, Voisey's Bay Nickel spokesman Bob Carter said today in a
telephone interview. The Voisey's Bay operation processes about
6,000 metric tons of nickel ore and produces about 1,300 tons of
concentrate daily.  
 Striking workers from Torngait Services handled shipments of
concentrate from the mine to vessels waiting at port, Carter
said. Workers for the other contractor, called Ushitau, maintain
equipment at the mine and the facility that processes ore into
nickel concentrate.  
 ``We don't see this as having any significant impact on our
overall operation,'' Carter said. ``We have been able to utilize
supervisory and management personnel from Ushitau, supplemented
by some additional resources that Torngait has been able to
provide.''  
 The last scheduled shipment left Voisey's Bay port in early
April, and the next voyage is scheduled in about two weeks,
Carter said.  
 Marie Kelly, a spokeswoman for the United Steelworkers
members in Labrador, wasn't immediately available for comment.
