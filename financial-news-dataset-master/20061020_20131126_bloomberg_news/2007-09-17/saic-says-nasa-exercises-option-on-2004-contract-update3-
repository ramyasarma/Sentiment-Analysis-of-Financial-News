             SAIC Inc. (SAI) , the defense company that
first sold shares to the public in October, said  NASA  exercised
an option valued at $205.9 million on a 2004 contract to provide
the space agency with information-technology services.  
 The contract applies to the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville,  Alabama , as well as other NASA centers and
headquarters, San Diego-based SAIC said today in a statement.
Exercise of the option, the second one-year renewal on the
January 2004 contract, raises the ceiling value of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration contract to about $956
million and extends work through 2008.  
 SAIC has received more than 85 percent of its sales from
the U.S. government in the past three years. The contractor won
an award valued at as much as $473 million from the Navy last
month to provide command, control and communications services
and began work on a chemical and petroleum supply management
order for the Defense Department valued as much as $6.2 billion
after a complaint on the award was denied.  
 SAIC fell 24 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $18.29 at 4:02 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. It has gained 0.6
percent since it began trading Oct. 13.
