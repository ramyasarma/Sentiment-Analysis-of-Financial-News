Kuwait Oil Co. conducted a study
revealing an increase in crude reserves of 12 billion barrels in
Kuwait’s Burgan field, the world’s second biggest oil field,  Al-
Jarida  reported, citing unidentified oil officials.  Kuwait Oil, the state-owned producer, expects other studies
to reveal additional reserves, resulting in an increase in
Kuwait’s total crude reserves, according to the newspaper.  Kuwait’s oil reserves may be less than half the official
estimate of 99 billion barrels, Petroleum Intelligence Weekly
reported last January, citing data it had seen from Kuwait Oil.
Burgan holds 20 billion barrels, Petroleum Intelligence said.  The reserves in Burgan field are “much higher” than
previously announced, the state news agency KUNA reported in
April, citing Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs  Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah .  To contact the reporter on this story:
