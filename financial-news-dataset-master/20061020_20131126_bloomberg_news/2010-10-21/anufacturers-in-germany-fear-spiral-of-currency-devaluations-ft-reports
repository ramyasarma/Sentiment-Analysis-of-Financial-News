German industrial companies are
concerned that export growth may be hampered by the dollar’s
declining value and the prospect of further quantitative easing
in the U.S., the Financial Times reported.  Anton Boerner , the president of the German exporters’
association, told the newspaper that further quantitative easing
will lead to “a currency devaluation spiral” that will hit
Europe hardest.  An executive at Volkswagen AG, whom the FT didn’t identify,
said a devaluation race would bring faster inflation, higher
interest rates and slower global growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
