The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts increased the most in five weeks as investors
bet on higher borrowing costs after the country’s  unemployment
rate  fell more than forecast in September.  Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose 7 basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to
11.34 percent at 4:30 p.m. New York time. Yields last increased
7 basis points on Sept. 16.  Brazil’s unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent from 6.7
percent in August, the national statistics agency said.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected 6.5 percent, according
to the median forecast of 36 analysts.  “When the unemployment rate came in below expectations,
it’s pretty much signaling that activity may be growing faster
than expected, and therefore at some point, the market starts to
believe the central bank will need to tighten monetary policy,
which will be by increasing interest rates,” said  Huang Kuo Seen , a portfolio manager at Grau Gestao De Ativos in Sao Paulo.  The central bank left its  benchmark interest rate 
unchanged yesterday at 10.75 percent. The unanimous decision was
forecast by all 51 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The real slid 1.1 percent to 1.6968 per dollar, from 1.6775
yesterday. It fell the most among 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
