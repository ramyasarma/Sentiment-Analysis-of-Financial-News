Crude steel production  in China, the
world’s biggest maker, dropped 5.9 percent in September compared
with a year ago as the government imposed power restrictions to
meet energy-efficiency targets.  Output was 47.95 million metric tons, according to data
from the National Statistics Bureau today. That was also lower
than August’s production of 51.64 million tons, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg news.  Power cuts in provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Zhejiang
and Guangdong may trim steel supply 9.6 percent over the rest of
this year, researcher Mysteel.com said on Sept. 9. Chinese
prices have gained 10 percent from July after mills cut output.  Hebei Iron & Steel Co. , the listed arm of China’s biggest
steelmaker, said on Sept. 14 that three of its units will cut a
combined 1.5 million tons of output from September through
December because of power limits.  China cut energy usage per unit gross domestic product by
15.6 percent from 2006 to 2010, less than its target for a 20
percent reduction, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Steel-products output in China gained 4.5 percent to 65.43
million tons last month from a year ago, the statistics bureau
also today said.  -- Feiwen Rong ,  Helen Yuan . Editors:  Jake Lloyd-Smith ,  Ravil Shirodkar   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
