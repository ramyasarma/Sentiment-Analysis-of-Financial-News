Chubb Corp. , the insurer of high-end
homes and corporate boards, raised its forecast for full-year
profit as share buybacks help boost earnings per share.  Operating income, which excludes some investment results,
will probably be $5.75 a share to $5.85 a share for 2010, up
from previous guidance of $5.15 to $5.55, the Warren, New
Jersey-based company said today in a statement distributed by PR
Newswire. Chubb’s third-quarter operating income was $1.69 a
share, beating the $1.41 average estimate of 22 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Based on these results for the third quarter and our
favorable outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing”
guidance, Chief Executive Officer  John Finnegan  said in the
statement.  Finnegan is using Chubb’s capital to repurchase stock as
commercial insurance prices decline.  Travelers Cos. , the insurer
added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2009, increased its
profit guidance today after reporting earnings per share that
topped analysts’ estimates by 23 percent.  Chubb repurchased 10.2 million shares for $555 million in
the third quarter.  Net income  fell to $572 million, or $1.80 per
share, from $596 million, or $1.69, for the same period last
year, the company said today. Catastrophe costs more than
doubled to $58 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
