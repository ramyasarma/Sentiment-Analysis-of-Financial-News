Strikes in France over port reform
and a government plan to increase the retirement age have caused
oil refineries to shut, leading to fuel shortages.  France’s 11 refineries can process 1.84 million barrels of
oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total SA’s
Flanders facility was mothballed last year because of weak
demand for fuels such as gasoline and diesel.  The following table shows the status of refineries, ranked
by processing capacity in barrels a day. The Cressier plant in
Switzerland is the only one outside France affected by the
strikes as it gets crude supplies via pipeline from the Fos port
in the Mediterranean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
