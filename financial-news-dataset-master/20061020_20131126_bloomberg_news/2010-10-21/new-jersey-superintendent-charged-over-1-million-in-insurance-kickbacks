Michael J. Ritacco, the
superintendent of the fourth-largest school district in New
Jersey, was charged today with taking more than $1 million in
kickbacks from an insurance broker who was indicted with him.  Ritacco, who runs the Toms River Regional School District,
was indicted with Francis X. Gartland on wire fraud, mail fraud,
and other corruption counts in federal court in Newark, New
Jersey. Gartland runs Federal Hill Risk Management LLC and other
companies in Towson, Maryland.  Prosecutors alleged that Ritacco took between $1 million
and $2 million in illegal payments from 2002 to this year.
Ritacco appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Newark,
who released him on a $1 million bond. Gartland is expected to
surrender to authorities tomorrow, said  Rebekah Carmichael , a
spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney  Paul Fishman .  Both men face as many as 20 years in prison on the most
serious charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
