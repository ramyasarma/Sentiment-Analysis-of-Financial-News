Union Pacific Corp. , the largest
U.S. railroad by 2009 revenue, said third-quarter profit rose 51
percent as revenue from auto shipments gained.  Net income  climbed to $778 million, or $1.56 a share, from
$514 million, or $1.01, a year earlier, Omaha, Nebraska-based
Union Pacific said today in a statement. The average estimate of
24 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg was profit of $1.50 a share.
Sales rose 20 percent to $4.41 billion.  Union Pacific, led by Chief Executive Officer  Jim Young ,
boosted automotive freight revenue 36 percent to $309 million as
rebounding vehicle sales boosted traffic. U.S. light-vehicle
deliveries last month rose to an 11.7 million annual rate from
9.4 million a year earlier. The railroad is the largest auto
carrier in the western U.S.  While the results were “solid,” investors may have
anticipated Union Pacific would exceed analysts’ estimates by a
larger margin,  Walter Spracklin , an analyst with RBC Capital
Markets, said in an interview.  Union Pacific fell 53 cents to $85.26 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 33
percent this year.  Union Pacific will finish the year with about 1,700 new
hires and plans to bring in as many as 4,000 next year, mostly
to replace workers lost through attrition, Young said in an
interview.  The company is seeing 50 percent discounts on property,
especially in Texas, Arizona and California, he said. The
company operates in 23 states in the Midwest and western U.S.  “I told the team to be aggressive in terms of the
opportunities” such as expanding rail yards or adding
intermodal facilities, he said. “Think long term. This business
is all about land.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
