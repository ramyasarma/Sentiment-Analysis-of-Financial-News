GDF Suez SA is ready to consider the
possibility of opening the capital of its gas pipelines, Les
Echos reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet
speaking in Berlin.  Such a move isn’t needed to reduce debt and GDF Suez is
more likely to sell assets in Belgium to achieve this aim, Les
Echos added, without citing anyone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
