Japan plans to add six submarines,
increasing its fleet to 22, the first time it has had more than
20 submarines since its first defense program in 1976, Kyodo
News said, citing unidentified Defense Ministry officials.  The enlarged submarine fleet is aimed at increasing Japan’s
ability to watch nearby waters, especially the East China Sea,
the news agency reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
