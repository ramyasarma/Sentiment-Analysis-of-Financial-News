Palm oil gained to more than 3,000
ringgit ($963) a metric ton for the first time since July 31,
2008, on speculation that supplies may lag behind surging demand
from China and India.  The January-delivery contract rose as much as 1.2 percent
to 3,021 ringgit on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange and was at
2,999 ringgit at the 12:30 p.m. break in Kuala Lumpur.  The world’s most-consumed edible oil has rallied 32 percent
from this year’s low in July, on a combination of weather-
related production concerns and substitution demand because of a
lower-than-forecast global soybean crop.  “Demand for agri-commodities is likely to outstrip supply
in the wake of strong emerging-market demand,” Tanuj Shori, an
analyst at Nomura Singapore Ltd., said today.  Nomura yesterday raised its average palm oil forecast for
2011 by 20 percent to 3,000 ringgit, and its forecast for this
year by 5 percent to 2,650 ringgit. Palm oil has averaged 2,555
ringgit in 2010.  “A tighter global vegetable oils outlook, a stronger crude
oil price and a weaker U.S. dollar point to higher crude palm
oil prices for next year,” the report said.  China’s economy grew 9.6 percent in the third quarter,
beating forecasts, as inflation accelerated in September to a
23-month high, the statistics bureau said today. China raised
key interest rates two days ago for the first time since 2007.  India, the top buyer of vegetable oils after China, may
import a record quantity of soybean and palm oils for a fourth
year as a growing population and rising incomes spur demand for
processed foods, Ashok Sethia, president of the Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India, said on Sept. 21.  Curbing Demand  Purchases may climb to 9.5 million tons in the year
starting Nov. 1, compared with 9 million tons this season, the
processors’ group said.  Palm oil needs to trade above 3,000 ringgit to discourage
Indian and Chinese imports,  Dorab Mistry , a director at Godrej
International Ltd., said on Aug. 26.  An oils trader for almost three decades, Mistry correctly
forecast in March that prices would rise to more than 3,000
ringgit after June. He said it may rise as high as 3,200 ringgit
on global oilseed supply concerns.  Palm oil is used in cooking and fuel applications, and is
sensitive to crude oil price movements,  James Fry , managing
director of LMC International, said yesterday in a speech at a
conference in Kuala Lumpur.  Crude oil surged 2.9 percent yesterday to $81.77 a barrel,
lifting commodities on concern that a weakening dollar would fan
inflation. It last traded 0.2 percent higher at $81.92.  Soyoil Climbs  Soybean oil in Chicago rose as much as 1 percent to 48.95
cents a pound, extending yesterday’s 2.9 percent jump to the
highest since September 2008, and last traded at 48.52 cents.  The gain widened the  discount  palm oil trades to soybean
oil to as much as $112.34 a ton, from an average of $100.48 a
ton last week and $83 last month, according to Bloomberg data.  When soybean oil widens its premium over palm oil, price-
sensitive markets such as China and India react quickly to the
changes, Fry said yesterday.  CME Group Inc.’s January palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, gained as much as 1.3 percent to
$967.25 a ton, the highest since the contract started trading in
May.  Palm oil on the Dalian Commodity Exchange for May delivery
soared as much as 3.7 percent to 8,428 yuan ($1,268) a ton,
pausing at 8,344 yuan at the 11:30 a.m. trading break.  To contact the reporter on this story:
