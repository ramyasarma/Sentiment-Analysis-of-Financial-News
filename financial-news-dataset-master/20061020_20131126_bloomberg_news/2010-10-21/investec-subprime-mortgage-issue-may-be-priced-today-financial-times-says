Investec Plc’s sale of 130 million
pounds ($204.1 million) of top-rated mortgage bonds could be
priced as early as today, the Financial Times said, citing
unidentified people close to the deal.  The South African bank had originally planned to sell as
much as 250 million pounds of notes in what will be Europe’s
first subprime mortgage securitization deal since the financial
crisis, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
