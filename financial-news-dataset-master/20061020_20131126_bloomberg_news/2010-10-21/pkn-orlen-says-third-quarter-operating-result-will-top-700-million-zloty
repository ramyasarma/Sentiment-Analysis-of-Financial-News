PKN Orlen SA , Poland’s largest oil
company, said third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes,
rose 77 percent from a year earlier as sales and refining
volumes increased.  Ebit increased to more than 750 million zloty ($265
million) from 423 million zloty last year, Plock, central
Poland-based Orlen said in a regulatory statement today.  The company’s refinery volume sales advanced 3 percent to
6.08 million tons, while sales of fuels at its gas stations
increased 6 percent to 1.94 million tons, Orlen said. The sales
and refineries’ throughput, which rose 1 percent to 7.4 million
tons, were at their highest since the start of 2009, it said.  “The results are not bad in general,”  Maciej Wewiorski ,
an analyst at Dom Maklerski IDMSA in Warsaw, said by phone. The
performance of retail more than offset a 34 percent quarterly
decline in refining margins, he said.  Profit from financial operations rose as the zloty
strengthened from the previous quarter, cutting the cost of
servicing  foreign currency denominated loans .  The  shares rose  2.2 percent to 40.12 zloty at 9:45 a.m. in
Warsaw. The benchmark WIG20 Index gained 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
