Hershey Co.  raised its forecast for
full-year earnings as it lures more customers through increased
advertising.  The forecast is now for earnings excluding some items of
$2.52 to $2.56 a share, Hershey said today in a statement. That
compares with a previous range of $2.47 to $2.52.  Hershey, led by Chief Executive Officer  David West , expects
to attract more consumers with new promotional campaigns. The
Hershey, Pennsylvania-based confectioner, whose best-selling
products include Reese’s peanut butter cups and Kisses, plans to
spend 50 percent to 60 percent more on advertising this year,
higher than it previously estimated.  Hershey fell $2.10, or 4.1 percent, to $49 at 10:02 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained
43 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
