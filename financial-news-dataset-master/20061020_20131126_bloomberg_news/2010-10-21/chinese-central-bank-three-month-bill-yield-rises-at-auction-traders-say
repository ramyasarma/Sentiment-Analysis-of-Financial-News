The People’s Bank of China sold 50
billion yuan ($7.5 billion) of three-month bills at a yield of
1.7726 percent in  open-market operations , the first time since
June 10 that the rate has increased.  The  yield  rose 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point,
from 1.5704 percent at the previous auction on Oct. 14 and in
the 13 sales before that. The  offering  of the 91-day bills was
the largest since July 22. The People’s Bank of China raised its
benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates by a quarter of a
percentage point this week, the first increase since 2007.  “The 20 basis-point rise in yield is relatively high as it
matched the increase in the three-month deposit rate and almost
matched the rise in the one-year deposit and lending rates,”
said  Dariusz Kowalczyk , a Hong Kong-based economist and
strategist for Credit Agricole CIB. “This is a signal that
monetary tightening is for real as the move will guide money-
market rates higher.”  The central bank  increased  lending and deposit rates with
maturities of three months to more than five years, effective
yesterday. The three-month deposit rate rose 20 basis points,
according to its Oct. 19 statement.  China’s inflation quickened to the fastest pace in 23
months in September, government data showed today.  Consumer
prices  climbed 3.6 percent, the most since October 2008.  The interest  rate  for three-month repurchase transactions
rose 20 basis points to 1.77 percent, the first time it has
moved since June 10.  -- Belinda Cao . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  Simon Harvey   To contact the Bloomberg news staff on this story:
