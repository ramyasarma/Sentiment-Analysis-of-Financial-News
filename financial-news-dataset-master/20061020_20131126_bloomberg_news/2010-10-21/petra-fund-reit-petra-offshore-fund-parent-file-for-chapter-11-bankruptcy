Petra Offshore Fund LP, along with
its Petra Fund REIT unit, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection in New York.  Petra Fund REIT, an investor in commercial real estate-
backed loans, and the parent company listed assets of $1 million
to $10 million and liabilities of $100 million to $500 million
in filings yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  The Chapter 11 filing follows a judgment one of the fund’s
creditors, KBS Preferred Holding I LLC, won against Petra to
collect on its debt, according to an affidavit filed with the
bankruptcy petition.  Petra said it has a restructuring agreement with a secured
creditor that requires it to file for bankruptcy.  The case is In re Petra Fund REIT Corp., 10-15500, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
