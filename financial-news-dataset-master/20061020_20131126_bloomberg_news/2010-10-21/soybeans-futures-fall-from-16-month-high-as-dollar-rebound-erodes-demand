(Corrects contract month to January in fourth paragraph)  Soybeans fell from a 16-month high,
dropping the most in two weeks, as a stronger dollar reduced
demand for commodities as alternative assets.  The  greenback  gained as much as 0.6 percent against a
basket of six currencies as investors shied away from riskier
assets before a Group of 20 meeting tomorrow in South Korea. The
19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index fell as much as
1.3 percent, led by declines in natural gas, silver and wheat.
Before today, soybeans surged 31 percent since June 1.  “With the dollar trading higher before the G-20 meeting,
that has encouraged a round of investor profit-taking,” said
 Chip Flory , the editor of the Professional Farmers of America
newsletter in Cedar Falls, Iowa. “The market is taking a
breather.”  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 10.75 cents, or
0.9 percent, to close at $12.13 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the fourth drop in five sessions and the
biggest decline since Oct. 6.  Earlier, the price reached $12.35, the highest level since
June 5, 2009, on signs of increased demand from China, the
world’s largest consumer.  Export sales  rose 85 percent to 2.017 million metric tons
in the week ended Oct. 14 from a week earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today. About 72 percent of the
total was sold to  China .  Cumulative  sales for delivery before
Aug. 31 rose to 25.329 million tons, up 14 percent from the same
time a year earlier.  “China’s buying just doesn’t slow because they are using
more in livestock rations,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
