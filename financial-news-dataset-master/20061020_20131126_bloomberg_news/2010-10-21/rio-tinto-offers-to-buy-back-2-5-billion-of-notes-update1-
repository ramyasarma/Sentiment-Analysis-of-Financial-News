A unit of  Rio Tinto Group , the
world’s third-largest mining company, offered to buy back as
much as $2.5 billion of bonds due in July 2013.  Rio Tinto will finance the offer through a combination of
new debt and cash, spokeswoman  Karen Halbert  said in a phone
interview from Melbourne today. The unit, Rio Tinto Finance
(USA) Ltd., is seeking to buy back the 5.875 percent notes at a
spread of 40 basis points to similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries,
according to a statement dated yesterday.  “The purpose of the transaction is to manage the group’s
potential future refinancing risk and take advantage of the
prevailing attractive debt capital market conditions,” Halbert
said. It’s “consistent with the group’s stated target of
achieving a single A credit rating.”  Rio Tinto, currently  rated  BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s, last
sold  bonds  in April 2009 and has $400 million of 6.45 percent
notes due in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
approved a $3.1 billion expansion of its Australian iron ore
operations yesterday.  The spread at which Rio Tinto is offering to buy back the
bonds equates to a price of about 113.5 cents on the dollar,
Deutsche Bank AG analysts  Gus Medeiros  and  Colin Tan  wrote in a
note to clients today. The bonds rose 1.6 cents today to 113.3,
a yield of 0.9 percent, according to Commonwealth Bank of
Australia prices as of 17:14 p.m. in Sydney.  A timeline hasn’t yet been set for the new bond issuance,
Rio Tinto’s Halbert said. Holders of the 2013 notes have until
Oct. 27 to accept the offer, which is being coordinated by
Morgan Stanley, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
