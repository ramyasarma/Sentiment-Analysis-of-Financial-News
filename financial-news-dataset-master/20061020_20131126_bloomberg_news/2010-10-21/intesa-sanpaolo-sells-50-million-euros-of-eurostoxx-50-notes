Intesa Sanpaolo SpA , Italy’s second-
biggest bank, sold 50 million euros ($69 million) of notes that
pay a coupon as long as the Eurostoxx 50 stock  index  doesn’t
fall more than 40 percent.  The 12-year securities track the equity benchmark from a
starting level of 2,848.41, paying 5.58 percent each year it’s
above 1,709.04 on any of the annual payment dates, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. No coupon is paid if the index is
below that level. Investors get their capital back at maturity.  The Eurostoxx 50 index, which includes Nokia Oyj, Danone SA
and Siemens AG, has declined 3.2 percent this year to 2,871.24.
