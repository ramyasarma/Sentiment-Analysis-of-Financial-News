Wayne Rooney ’s future at Manchester
United remained unresolved following meetings today.  Rooney said yesterday he wants to leave United over
concerns about the 18-time English soccer champion’s ability to
sign new players. Manager  Alex Ferguson  met today with Chief
Executive Officer  David Gill , along with the striker’s agent,
without a decision being reached.  “We are aware that there is intense public and media
interest on the club at the moment, but there was not
developments of note to report today,” a  statement  on the
club’s website said. “A number of meetings have taken place
today, including with the player’s representative. The outcome
of those meetings will become clear in the near future. In the
meantime, fans are asked to be patient.”  Ferguson said after last night’s Champions League win over
Bursaspor that he wanted to “put the matter to bed.” The
statement didn’t mention any further scheduled talks.  Rooney has struggled this season, scoring just one goal,
after injuries and media reports about his personal life limited
his playing time.  Ferguson didn’t play the 24-year-old in several games,
saying Rooney was injured. After playing for England’s national
team on Oct. 12, Rooney said didn’t know why Ferguson thought he
was injured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
