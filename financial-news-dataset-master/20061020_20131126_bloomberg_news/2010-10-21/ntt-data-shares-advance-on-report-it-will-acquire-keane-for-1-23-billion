NTT Data Corp. , the network-services
unit of Japan’s largest phone operator, rose the most in a week
in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei newspaper reported the company
may buy a U.S. technology developer.  The shares  climbed as much as 3.2 percent to 255,000 yen
and changed hands 0.9 percent higher at 9:25 a.m. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average was unchanged.  The unit of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. will buy
Boston-based Keane Inc. for about 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion),
the Nikkei reported today, without saying where it obtained the
information. The acquisition is part of NTT Data’s efforts to
boost overseas sales.  Tokyo-based NTT Data will purchase all the shares in Keane,
which is half-owned by a Citigroup Inc. unit, with the rest held
by employees, the Nikkei newspaper reported. The companies aim
to reach an agreement by the end of this month, the report said.  Norihiko Sugimoto , a spokesman at Tokyo-based NTT Data, and
Tara Jantzen, a spokeswoman at Keane, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
