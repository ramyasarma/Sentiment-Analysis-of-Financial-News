Madagascar ’s uranium mining
regulator is looking to revive exploration on the island by
asking companies to work together and reprocessing geological
data compiled in the 1980s for investors.  “The strategy is to make a synergy between uranium
exploration companies to create more value,” Joeli Valérien
Lalaharisaina, general director of the Office for National
Mining and Strategic Industries, said in an interview in the
capital, Antananarivo, today. The bureau will present proposals
to ministers soon, he said.  The Mines and Hydrocarbons Minister, Mamy Ratovomalala,
said last month that he had not issued any permits since last
September as the ministry steps up inspection of investors. It
may issue some before the end of the year, he said.  All uranium exploration in Madagascar has halted since a
political crisis began early last year, Lalaharisaina said.
