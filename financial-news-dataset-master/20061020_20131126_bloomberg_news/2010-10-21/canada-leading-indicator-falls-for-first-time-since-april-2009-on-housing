Canada’s index of  leading economic
indicators  unexpectedly fell in September, the first decline
since April 2009, led by housing and manufacturing.  The index dropped 0.1 percent after a revised gain of 0.6
percent in August, Ottawa-based Statistics Canada said today.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said the index would rise
0.2 percent, based on the median of eight estimates. The index’s
average monthly increase over the past decade is 0.3 percent.  New orders for durable-goods manufacturers fell 1.9 percent
from the previous month, and the average factory workweek fell
by 0.3 percent to 36.6 hours. Statistics Canada’s measure of
housing starts and existing home sales fell 3.2 percent.  The Bank of Canada yesterday cut its third-quarter  economic
growth  forecast to 1.6 percent from 2.8 percent and said growth
will slow to 2.3 percent next year after the government slows
stimulus spending. The central bank kept its key lending rate at
1 percent two days ago and said monetary policy tightening would
be “carefully considered.”  Five of the index’s 10 components decreased in September.
Retail sales of furniture and appliances fell 0.7 percent, and
sales of other durable goods rose 0.9 percent.  A separate report said the number of Canadians receiving
regular jobless benefits declined 0.1 percent in August from
July to 671,210, and by 13 percent from the year-ago month.  Canada has recovered all the jobs lost in a recession that
ended last year. The Bank of Canada said yesterday that
unemployment “remains elevated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
