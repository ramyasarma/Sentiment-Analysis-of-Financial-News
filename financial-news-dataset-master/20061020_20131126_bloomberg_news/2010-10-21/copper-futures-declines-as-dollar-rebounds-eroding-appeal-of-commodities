Copper fell as the dollar erased a
decline, eroding demand for commodities as alternative assets.  The greenback was up 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies after dropping as much as 0.4 percent. Copper has
climbed 8.7 percent since Sept. 1 while the dollar slumped 6.2
percent as traders bet the Federal Reserve will further ease
monetary policy to stimulate the U.S. economy. Policy makers
meet on Nov. 3.  “Everything, including copper, is taking its cue from the
dollar ahead of the Fed announcement,” said  Matthew Zeman , a
metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.  Copper futures for December delivery fell 1.2 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.7815 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price climbed as much as 1.5 percent.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
dropped as much as 1.1 percent after approaching the highest
level in two years.  The Fed has kept its benchmark lending rate at zero percent
to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and purchased Treasuries and
mortgage-backed securities.  Earlier, copper rose after a report showed economic growth
in China, the world’s largest user, topped economists’
estimates.  “The Chinese demand stories are still out there,” said
 Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago. “China’s
economy is still expanding, and China is the big mover on
copper.”  In London, copper for delivery in three months fell $33, or
0.4 percent, to $8,307 a metric ton ($3.77 a pound). Aluminum,
nickel and tin also dropped. Lead and zinc gained.  To contact the reporter on the story:
