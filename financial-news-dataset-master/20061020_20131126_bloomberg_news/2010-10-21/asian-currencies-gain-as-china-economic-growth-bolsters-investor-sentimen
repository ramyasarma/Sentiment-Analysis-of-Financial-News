Asian currencies rose after China’s
third-quarter economic growth beat analysts’ estimates, helping
to ease concern that an unexpected interest-rate increase will
slow the world’s second-largest economy.  The Singapore dollar rallied the most since May, while
Taiwan’s currency saw its biggest gain in a week after China
signaled its preference for a stronger yuan by setting the daily
 fixing  higher against the greenback. U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner will meet his counterparts from the Group of
20 nations in Gyeongju, South Korea, over the next few days with
currency policies likely to be on the agenda.  “China’s data shows that the economy is still holding up
quite well and they can continue to appreciate the currency,”
said  Ho Woei Chen , a regional economist at United Overseas Bank
Ltd. in Singapore. “This will lead Asian currencies higher.
China also set a stronger yuan fixing today and there is talk
that Geithner will pressure China to appreciate its currency at
the G-20 talks.”  Singapore’s dollar strengthened 0.8 percent to S$1.2972 as
of 4:22 p.m. local time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to NT$30.869 and
the Thai baht rose 0.2 percent to 29.85. Malaysia’s ringgit
climbed 0.4 percent to 3.1060 and the Philippine peso advanced
0.3 percent to 43.245.  G-20, Currencies  Currencies and trade flows will be at the center of talks
as G-20 finance ministers try to resolve differences over
exchange-rate policies, a U.S. Treasury Department official said
yesterday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Some emerging-
market nations are keeping their currencies undervalued, the
official added.  China’s gross domestic product increased 9.6 percent in the
third quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
today, more than the 9.5 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey. Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent in September, the
fastest pace in 23 months, the government also reported today.  The central bank on Oct. 19 lifted its benchmark one-year
lending and deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage point to
5.56 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. It was the first
increase since 2007.  The People’s Bank of China today set the yuan  reference 
rate 0.1 percent higher at 6.6695 per dollar. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards climbed 0.32 percent to 6.42, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 3.3 percent from the spot rate
of 6.6425. The currency has gained 2.7 percent since a two-year-
old peg to the dollar was scrapped on June 19.  Higher Yields  The ringgit rebounded from a seven-week low on heightened
speculation the Federal Reserve will unveil more monetary
stimulus next month after a regional survey released yesterday
showed the U.S. economy expanded in September at a “modest
pace.”  “The market is consolidating but I’m still expecting more
ringgit appreciation going into next year,” said  Zulkiflee Nidzam , head of foreign-exchange trading at Asian Finance Bank
Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The dollar can’t sustain its rally
because the Fed’s program will support demand for higher
yields.”  Elsewhere, South Korea’s won fell 0.2 percent against the
dollar to 1,129.60. Indonesia’s rupiah and the Indian rupee both
climbed 0.1 percent to 8,928 and 44.31 respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
