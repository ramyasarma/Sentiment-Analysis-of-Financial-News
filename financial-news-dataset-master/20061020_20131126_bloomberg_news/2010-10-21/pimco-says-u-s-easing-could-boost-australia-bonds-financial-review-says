Pacific Investment Management Co.
said more demand for Australian bonds could result from
quantitative easing in the U.S., the Australian Financial Review
reported, citing Chief Operating Officer  Doug Hodge .  Investors would seek to place their money in countries with
higher interest rates such as Australia that offer greater
yields as more liquidity is made available, the newspaper  cited 
Hodge as saying. Australian banks need foreign investment to
fund their balance sheets, he added, according to the report.  Pimco, which runs the world’s biggest bond fund, expects
Australia’s ageing population would create more demand for
Australian bonds, according to Hodge.  The nation’s superannuation sector has the lowest
proportion of fixed income investments when compared to its
peers in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, the newspaper reported, citing  John Wilson , head of
Pimco’s Australian operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
