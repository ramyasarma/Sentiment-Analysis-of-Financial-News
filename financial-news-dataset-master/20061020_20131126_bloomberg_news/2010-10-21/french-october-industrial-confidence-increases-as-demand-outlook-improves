Confidence among French factory
executives climbed in October as investment and inventory
building suggested demand is strengthening.  An  index of sentiment  among factory executives rose to 102
from a revised 99 in September, national statistics office Insee
said today. Economists expected a reading of 98, according to a
survey of 13 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg News.  The figures reflect a shift in France’s recovery from its
worst recession since World War II to domestic demand from
exports, previously the main driver of the pickup. Growth
accelerated to 0.7 percent in the second quarter from 0.2
percent in the first as companies such as BNP Paribas SA and
cosmetics maker  L’Oreal SA  begin hiring again.  “The outlook for domestic demand has brightened as
unemployment has fallen,” said  Pierre-Olivier Beffy , chief
economist at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris. “The investment cycle
continues apace and the inventory cycle is not yet over,”
meaning “order books are growing steadily.”  The number of unemployed actively looking for work in
France has slipped to 2.69 million at the end of August from a
five-year high of 2.7 million in May. The labor and finance
ministries report jobless claims for September on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
