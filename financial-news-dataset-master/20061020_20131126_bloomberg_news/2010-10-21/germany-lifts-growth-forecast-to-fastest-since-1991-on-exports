The German government said the
economy will grow this year at the fastest pace since 1991,
raising its forecast as exports to China and other Asian
countries boom and consumer spending revives.  Europe’s largest economy will probably grow by 3.4 percent
in 2010 and by 1.8 percent next year, the Economy Ministry said
in a report today. The government previously forecast an
expansion of 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.  Foreign demand for cars and machines dragged Germany out
recession in the second quarter of last year.  Exports , which
made up 41 percent of the country’s gross domestic product in
2009, will grow 16 percent this year, the BGA exporters group
said on Oct. 19. Sales of goods and services to countries
outside Europe will grow 25 percent, the exporters said.  “Economic recovery doesn’t need crutches anymore -- it is
self-sustaining,” Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle  told
reporters in Berlin.  Siemens AG , Europe’s largest engineering company, has
raised its earnings outlook twice this year as demand advances
for products from high-speed trains to medical equipment. Shares
in  Bayerische Motoren Werke  AG have risen 56 percent this year,
the most among the 30 companies in Germany’s DAX index, as
global sales of BMW luxury cars rebound. BMW and  Daimler AG’s 
Mercedes are targeting 10 percent sales increases this year.  The  DAX stock index , which climbed as much as 0.5 percent
today, has gained 10 percent this year, compared with a decline
of 3 percent in the Euro Stoxx 50 gauge of euro-area equities.  Forecasts Lifted  The updated economic forecast follows upward revisions by
the Bundesbank and Germany’s leading economic institutes. The
expansion would be the fastest since 1991, when reunification
boosted growth to 5.1 percent, according to the Federal
Statistics Office.  Consumer spending will increase 0.1 percent this year and
1.1 percent in 2011, after shrinking 0.2 percent last year, the
report said.  Economic growth slowed in the third quarter, the Finance
Ministry said today, without giving figures. At 2.2 percent,
economic expansion in the second quarter was the fastest
quarterly growth rate in two decades.  Today’s report was an annual review of the economy that
underpins the government’s tax-revenue estimate in November and
budget planning next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
