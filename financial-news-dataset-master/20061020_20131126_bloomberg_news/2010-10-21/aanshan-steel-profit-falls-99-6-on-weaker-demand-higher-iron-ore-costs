Maanshan Iron & Steel Co. , China’s
second-biggest Hong Kong-traded steelmaker, said third-quarter
profit fell 99.6 percent because demand slowed and high prices
of raw materials eroded margins.  Net income dropped to 3.04 million yuan ($460,000), or
0.0004 yuan a share, from 802.3 million yuan, or 0.10 yuan, a
year ago, the Maanshan, Anhui province-based company said in a
Shanghai stock exchange filing today, citing Chinese accounting
standards. Sales rose 18 percent to 16.99 billion yuan.  Steel prices  in China fell as much as 17 percent from April
to July as the government introduced measures to curb property
speculation. Chinese mills face a “difficult” second half, Xu
Lejiang, chairman of Baosteel Group Corp., China’s second-
biggest steelmaker, said on May 9.  Maanshan  rose 1.3 percent HK$4.86 in Hong Kong trading
today, compared with a 0.4 percent gain in the Hang Seng Index.
The stock has fallen 14 percent this year, compared with the
benchmark’s 8.1 percent increase.  Chinese steel prices fell 17 percent to 3,888 yuan a ton on
July 14 from 4,698 yuan on April 15, according to Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  Angang Steel Co. , the biggest Chinese steelmaker traded in
Hong Kong, may post a third-quarter net loss after prices fell
and raw-material prices gained, according to figures derived
from the company’s nine-month profit projection in August. That
would be a loss for the first time in five quarters.  Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd., two of the world’s
largest iron ore suppliers, demanded a 22 percent increase in
third-quarter iron ore prices, according to UC361.com analyst Hu
Kai. For the fourth quarter, Rio Tinto, Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. and Kobe Steel Ltd., Japan’s third- and fourth-
largest steelmakers, settled on a 13 percent price cut, the
first decline in three quarters, Sumitomo said Sept. 8.  Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton Ltd. this year dropped a custom
of setting annual prices for steelmaking commodities in favor of
quarterly agreements.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
