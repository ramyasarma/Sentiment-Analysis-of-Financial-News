Gheorghe Hagi will succeed Frank
Rijkaard as coach of Turkish soccer team Galatasaray, the club
said on its website.  The 45-year-old Romanian won the domestic league and cup as
a player with Galatasaray and helped the club win the UEFA Cup
in 2000. He coached the Istanbul-based team in 2004-05, and his
managerial career also includes spells with the Romanian
national team and Steaua Bucharest.  Rijkaard left Galatasaray by mutual consent, the club said
yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
