Bank of America Corp., the world’s
fifth-biggest adviser on mergers and acquisitions, named  Jack MacDonald  and  Patrick Ramsey  to run the M&A business in the
Americas.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender announced the
promotions of the two former Merrill Lynch & Co. bankers in a
memorandum this week from  Jeffrey Kaplan , the global head of
M&A, that was obtained by Bloomberg News.  John Yiannacopoulos , a
spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America,
confirmed the memo’s content.  MacDonald, based in Menlo Park, California, advised Sybase
Inc. on its $5.8 billion sale to SAP AG this year, and Foundry
Networks Inc. on its 2008 acquisition by Brocade Communications
Systems Inc., Kaplan said in the memo.  Ramsey is part of the Bank of America team advising Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan on the $40 billion hostile bid by BHP
Billiton Ltd. He advised Dow Chemical Co. on its $16.5 billion
acquisition of Rohm & Haas Co. last year, according to the memo.  Michael McIvor , who has been a banker at the lender for
seven years, was named vice chairman of Americas M&A, Kaplan
said in the memo.  Kaplan had been filling in as head of M&A in the Americas,
in addition to his global role, since  Alan Hartman  left last
year to join Centerview Partners, the advisory boutique.  To contact the reporter on this story:
