Sasol Ltd. , the world’s largest
producer of motor fuels from coal, said it plans to commission
heat recovery steam generators on gas turbines at its Secunda
plant in South Africa next year to help generate 800 megawatts
of electricity.  The company, based in Johannesburg, will spend about 1
billion rand ($145 million) on the generators, which will be
commissioned in July, Piet van Staden, manager for strategic
sourcing at the group’s utility energy unit, said today in a
presentation at the plant.  Xstrata Plc , Anglo American Plc and ArcelorMittal South
Africa Ltd. are also considering building power plants as Eskom
Holdings Ltd., the country’s electricity utility, struggles to
fund a seven-year, 485 billion-rand expansion plan to overcome a
capacity shortage.  Eskom, which supplies about 95 percent of South Africa’s
power, has warned of possible outages over the next few years
after some mines, smelters and industrial plants were
temporarily closed in early 2008.  Sasol will supply its own operations with electricity from
the power plant and plans to sell 200 megawatts to Eskom, Sasol
said in a statement handed to reporters at Secunda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
