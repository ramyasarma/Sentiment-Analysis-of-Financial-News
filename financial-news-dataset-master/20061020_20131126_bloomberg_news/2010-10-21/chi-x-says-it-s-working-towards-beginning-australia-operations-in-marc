Chi-X Global Inc., an electronic-
trading-platform that won preliminary approval to become a
competitor to Australian stock exchange operator ASX Ltd., said
it’s working towards starting operations by March.  Chi-X may delay its start-up until May, the Australian
Financial Review reported in its Street Talk column today,
without saying where it got the information.  The company is “eagerly” waiting for the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission to publish a new timetable
for the entry of rivals to ASX, Peter Fowler, Chi-X Australia
Pty.’s chief operating officer, said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
