South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus said the nation’s policy makers would not want to be
seen as being “soft on inflation” and that there may “not
necessarily” be an interest-rate cut at the next monetary
policy committee meeting in November, according to an interview
published by the Financial Mail.  Monetary policy makers at the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank
“should be focused on the data” and may change their minds
“if the data changes,” the Johanesburg-based weekly magazine
quoted her as saying. Intervention in the currency market
“isn’t necessarily” the solution to gains in the rand as a
“combination of actions” was required, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
