France has replaced its top safety
adviser on the Channel Tunnel after four months on the job
following government criticism of rule changes that would let
German-built trains used the tunnel, the Financial Times
reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.  Francoise Deygout has been replaced by Michel Aymeric, who
now heads the country’s national rail-safety regulator, as the
leader of the French delegation to the Channel Tunnel Safety
Authority, the FT said.  France’s Alstom SA is taking Eurostar Group Ltd. to court
to try to prevent it from completing an order for new trains
from German group Siemens AG, the newspaper said.  Neither the French delegation to the safety authority nor
the French railway safety agency were available for comment, the
FT said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
