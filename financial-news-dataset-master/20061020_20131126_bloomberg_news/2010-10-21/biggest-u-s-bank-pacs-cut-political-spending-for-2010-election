Seven of the  10 biggest U.S. banks ,
including Bank of America Corp. and  Citigroup Inc. , reduced
their political giving even as Congress enacted the biggest
overhaul of financial regulations since the Great Depression.  Only  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  MetLife Inc. , both based
in New York, and the U.S. subsidiary of  Deutsche Bank AG  of
Frankfurt, increased their political action committee donations
for the 2010 elections from 2008, Federal Election Commission
filings show. The reverse was true for lobbying; eight of the 10
banks boosted their spending this year as compared to a year
ago, Senate records show.  Rogan Kersh , associate dean of New York University’s Wagner
School of Public Service, said some lawmakers don’t want money
from bank PACs, and some financial companies don’t have the
funds to give at previous levels.  “Many candidates remain leery of bank funds; they’ve still
got a certain odor about them,” Kersh said. “Second, several
large banks are still in financial difficulty and aren’t capable
of ladling out the cash as in the past.”  The legislation, passed over near-unanimous Republican
opposition and signed by President  Barack Obama  on July 21, is
designed to address abuses by the financial sector blamed for
the economic meltdown.  Goldman Sachs  Goldman Sachs boosted donations by its PAC between Jan. 1,
2009, and Sept. 30, 2010, to $848,400, a 10 percent increase
from $772,000 during the same period two years earlier.
MetLife’s PAC gave out $941,188 in 2009-10, up from $895,400 in
2007-08. Deutsche Bank’s PAC gave $71,700, an increase from
$40,900 during the last election.  Other big U.S. banks curbed their political giving.  The PAC of Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, gave out $626,000, down 27 percent from $856,322 for the
2008 elections. Citigroup’s PAC donations dropped to $567,500
from $886,100.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  gave $974,500 in PAC contributions for
the 2010 elections, including $365,000 last month. The total is
down 30 percent from the $1.4 million in donations for the 2008
campaign.  Reduced Giving  The others among the 10 largest banks that also reduced
their PAC giving for the current campaign were  HSBC Holdings
Plc ,  Morgan Stanley ,  Wells Fargo & Co.  and  Barclays Plc.   Of the top 10 banks, only Citigroup and MetLife reduced
their lobbying expenses during the first nine months of 2010
compared with the same period in 2009.  Among those that increased their expenses, JPMorgan’s grew
to $5.8 million from $4.3 million, and Goldman Sachs increased
the amount it spent on lobbying to $3.6 million from $2.1
million.  Shirley Norton , a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, had no immediate comment.  John Calagna , a spokesman for MetLife;  Melissa Daly , a
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs;  Molly Millerwise Meiners , a
spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup; and  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
