Algeria will buy 100 percent of
Djezzy, the local mobile-phone unit of Orascom Telecom Holding,
after the Egyptian company settles its debts, Prime Minister
 Ahmed Ouyahia  said today.  Orascom Telecom will have to pay $230 million in debts as
well as $190 million in fines for money transfers, Ouyahia said
today in parliament.  “We do not recognize any partner other than Orascom with
whom we have signed a deal,” Ouyahia said, in a reference to
Russia’s VimpelCom which this month agreed to merge phone assets
with Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris .  Sawiris’s Weather Investments SpA has a 51.7 percent stake
in Orascom Telecom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
