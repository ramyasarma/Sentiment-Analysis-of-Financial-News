Accor SA , Europe’s largest hotelier,
rose to a two-year high in Paris trading after increasing its
profit target for the year as third-quarter sales growth
accelerated.  Accor gained as much as 71 cents, or 2.4 percent, to 29.74
euros, the highest since September 2008, and was 1.4 percent
higher at 9:20 a.m. local time.  Earnings before interest and taxes may rise to between 400
million euros ($558 million) and 420 million euros this year,
compared with its previous target of 370 million to 390 million
euros, Evry, France-based Accor said in a  statement  yesterday
after the close of trading.  Occupancy rates and prices rose this year as the lodging
industry recovered from the recession, which deterred
vacationers and led companies to cut travel budgets, according
to researcher STR Global. Accor said group revenue climbed to
1.58 billion euros from 1.44 billion euros a year earlier. That
beat the 1.52 billion-euro average  estimate  of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
