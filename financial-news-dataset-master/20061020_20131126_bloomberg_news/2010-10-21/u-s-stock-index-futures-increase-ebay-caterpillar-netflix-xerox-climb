U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after new claims for jobless benefits decreased more than
forecast last week.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 0.6 percent to 1,181.3 at 8:32 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures advanced 59 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 11,122.  Initial jobless claims declined by 23,000 to 452,000 in the
week ended Oct. 15, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The total number of people receiving unemployment
insurance fell, while those getting extended payments rose.  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 1,178.17 yesterday,
maintaining gains after the Federal Reserve said in its Beige
Book business survey that U.S. economic growth showed little
sign of accelerating last month, fueling speculation it will
boost purchases of government debt. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average increased 129.35 points, or 1.2 percent, to 11,107.97.  Eighty-six of the 101 companies in the S&P 500 that
reported earnings since Oct. 7 have beaten analyst estimates for
per-share profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The index of U.S. leading indicators probably climbed in
September for the third straight month, signaling the recovery
will extend into 2011, economists said before a report at 10
a.m. New York time today.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months rose 0.3 percent, according to the median
estimate of 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  EBay Inc. forecast better-than-estimated sales and
earnings. Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe, halfway through
a three-year campaign to revive growth, has cut listing fees to
lure more sellers and taken steps to make EBay’s Marketplaces
commerce site easier to use.   Caterpillar Inc., the world’s largest maker of construction
and mining equipment, raised its full-year forecast to $3.80 to
$4 a share from $3.15 to $3.85. The average analyst estimate was
$3.76. Caterpillar also posted third-quarter earnings of $1.22 a
share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.09 in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
