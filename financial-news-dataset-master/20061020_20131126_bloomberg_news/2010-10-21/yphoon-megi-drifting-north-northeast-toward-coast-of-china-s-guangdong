Typhoon Megi was about 430 kilometers
east-southeast of Hong Kong at 2 a.m. local time and is forecast
to move north or north-northeast at about 8 kilometers an hour,
according to the city’s weather service.  The typhoon has retained its “severe” strength and
drifted north-northeast toward the eastern coast of China’s
Guangdong province, the Hong Kong Observatory said on its
website today.  The No. 3 storm signal will remain in effect in the city,
with a higher alert unlikely before noon local time, the
government agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
