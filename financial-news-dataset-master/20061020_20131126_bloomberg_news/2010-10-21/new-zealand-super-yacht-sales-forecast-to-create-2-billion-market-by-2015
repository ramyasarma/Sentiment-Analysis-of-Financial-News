Annual sales of New Zealand boats
and equipment are likely to increase by more than 50 percent to
NZ$2.66 billion ($2 billion) by 2015 as demand for luxury yachts
returns, according to an industry body.  The recovering yacht market, as well as new infrastructure
in key ports, will boost the size of the industry,  New Zealand
Marine Industry Association  said in an e-mailed statement. The
country’s boat builders sold 10 superyachts, worth an estimated
NZ$500 million, in the last 11 months. None were sold in the
previous 14 months, according to NZMI.  New Zealand’s marine industry reported annual turnover of
NZ$1.7 billion this year, according to NZMI figures. While new
superyachts and refits are likely to fuel future growth, sales
of marine equipment are expected to reach NZ$600 million per
annum by 2015 and as much as NZ$700 million by 2020, NZMI said.  “This is not only good news for our industry and our
members,” NZMI Executive Director Peter Busfield said in the
statement. “It also represents a very significant growth in our
contribution to the New Zealand economy”.  The number of large pleasure boats mooring or being
refitted in New Zealand has already increased, Busfield said.
That includes Athena, one of the world’s largest aluminum
pleasure boats, moored on one of two 90 meter berths at
Auckland’s  Westhaven  marina.  To contact the reporter for this story:
