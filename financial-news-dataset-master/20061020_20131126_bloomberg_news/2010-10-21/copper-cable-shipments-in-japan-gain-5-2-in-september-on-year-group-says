Japan’s copper wire and cable
shipments climbed 5.2 percent in September from a year earlier,
the most since June, gaining for the ninth straight month, an
industry group said.  Shipments, including exports and domestic business,
increased to 61,000 metric tons last month from 57,984 tons a
year earlier, the  Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers’
Association  said today in an e-mailed statement.  Growth accelerated from 4.9 percent in August, led by a 16
percent expansion in shipments to electric machinery makers and
a 4.1 percent increase in shipments to the construction sector,
according to the statement. It was also the most since June,
when shipments gained 6 percent.  Copper, used in pipes and wires, has climbed 13 percent on
the London Metal Exchange this year. Japanese Prime Minister
 Naoto Kan  said on Oct. 19 he wants to implement stimulus
measures as quickly as possible to support the expansion after
the government downgraded its assessment of the economy for the
first time in 20 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
