Stephen Orlins , president of the
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, said today that U.S.
public pressure on the Chinese over the valuation of the yuan is
“counter-productive.” Orlins, speaking in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop with Betty Liu,” said
China’s view is that it can’t be seen as giving in to U.S.
pressure.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
