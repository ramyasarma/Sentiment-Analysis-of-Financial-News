Dell Inc. plans to spend “hundreds
of millions” of dollars on a new advertising campaign to
promote its computers and devices aimed at consumers, said  Paul- Henri Ferrand , the company’s chief marketing officer.  The campaign’s tagline is “You Can Tell It’s Dell” and is
intended to show how Dell’s computers are distinct from those
sold by  Hewlett-Packard Co.  and other rivals, he said in an
interview today.  “You can still be different even if you’re using common
components,” Ferrand said. “We need to reinvigorate the brand.”  Dell, the world’s third-largest maker of personal computers
after HP and Acer Inc., has been losing market share in the
U.S., where its shipments declined 4.9 percent in the third
quarter, according to market researcher IDC. To set its products
apart, Dell is adding features including touch screens and more
powerful built-in speakers for playing music, Ferrand said.  The marketing campaign will include television spots, due
to start Nov. 6, and print ads about a week later, Dell said.  In the U.S., Dell had 23.1 percent of PC shipments in the
third quarter, after HP, which had 24.3 percent, according to
IDC. Rivals including Apple Inc. added share in the period.  Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, fell 9 cents to $14.60 at
4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It has
 gained  1.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
