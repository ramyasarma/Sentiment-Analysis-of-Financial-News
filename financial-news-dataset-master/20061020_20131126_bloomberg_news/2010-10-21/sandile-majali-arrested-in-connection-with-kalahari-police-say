South African businessman Sandile
Majali was arrested by the commercial crimes unit of the
nation’s police force today.  “Sandile Majali has been arrested by the Hawks today in
connection with Kalahari Resources,” police spokesman Lungela
Dlamini said by phone from Johannesburg today, declining to
comment further.  Kalahari Resources (Pty) Ltd., a closely held company
partnering with ArcelorMittal’s local unit to develop a
manganese project in South Africa, had two directors removed
from its board last month without their knowledge.   Documents filed at the Companies and Intellectual Property
Registration Office show Majali and seven others were appointed
as directors in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
