Central Japan Railway Co.  fell the
most in more than 1 1/2 years after the government said a
planned magnetic-levitation line linking Tokyo and Nagoya may
cost more than the company forecast.  JR Central, the nation’s largest operator of high-speed
trains, fell 5.7 percent, the biggest decline since March 12,
2009, to close at 609,000 yen in Tokyo trading.  The maglev line, scheduled for completion by 2027, may cost
 5.5 trillion yen  ($68 billion), according to a report released
by the transport ministry yesterday. JR Central, which plans to
fund the project itself, expects the line to cost 5.1 trillion
yen, Michiko Ishizu, a spokeswoman, reiterated by phone today.  “The current estimate may increase,” said  Yasuhiro Matsumoto , an analyst in Tokyo at Shinsei Securities Co. “It’s
too much for one company to pay.”  JR Central’s cost estimate is based on the shortest of
three possible routes being considered for the line. The Nagoya-
based train operator has yet to decide which route it will use.  U.S. Transportation Secretary  Ray LaHood  rode on a 502
kilometers-per-hour (312 mph) maglev train at JR Central’s test
track in May. A Maglev system uses magnetic power to propel
trains that float above the track.  A maglev train, built using technology developed by  Siemens
AG  and ThyssenKrupp AG, is in commercial operation in Shanghai.
Passengers there are whisked along at 431 kph from Pudong
International Airport to the outskirts of the city’s financial
district.  Japan’s maglev holds the world rail-speed record at 581
kph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
