(Corrects insured status of mortgages in fourth paragraph
of story published yesterday.)  Bank of Nova Scotia , Canada’s third-
largest bank, plans to sell $2.5 billion of five-year covered
bonds as soon as today, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  The offering would bring sales of U.S. dollar covered bonds
to $28.9 billion this year, the most on record, Bloomberg data
show.  The Bank of Nova Scotia debt may yield 32 basis points more
than the benchmark midswap rate, said the person, who declined
to be identified because terms aren’t set. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. insures the home loans
backing the debt, which is expected to be rated Aaa by Moody’s
Investors Service, the person said.  Bank of Nova Scotia last sold U.S. dollar-denominated
covered bonds in July, when it issued $2.5 billion of the bonds
due in three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Covered bonds are typically backed by mortgages or public-
sector loans. The collateral underlying the debt remains with
the issuer.  Banks issued $26.6 billion of the debt in dollars in 2007,
the previous record, Bloomberg data show.  Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank are the
largest Canadian banks ranked by assets, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
