United Airlines and Continental
Airlines posted third-quarter profits amid improving business-
travel demand that is letting them charge more for tickets.  United said profit excluding some items was $473 million,
or $2.12 a share. Continental’s profit was $367 million, or
$2.24 a share.  Rebounding travel demand is enabling the carriers to boost
fares while keeping planes full. The carriers merged in October
in an all-stock deal to form Chicago-based  United Continental
Holdings Inc. , surpassing  Delta Air Lines Inc.  as the world’s
largest airline.  “As we integrate the two networks and create the world’s
leading airline, we will provide even more value to our
customers,” Chief Revenue Officer  Jim Compton  said today in a
statement.  United’s revenue rose 22 percent to $5.39 billion. Analysts
estimated $5.41 billion. Continental’s revenue advanced 19
percent to $3.95 billion. Analysts predicted $3.91 billion, on
average.  United had been the third-largest carrier in the U.S.
before the $3.47 billion merger and Houston-based Continental
was No. 4.  United Continental Holdings  jumped $1.94, or 7.6 percent,
to $27.63 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have advanced 12 percent since they began
trading when the merger was completed Oct. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
