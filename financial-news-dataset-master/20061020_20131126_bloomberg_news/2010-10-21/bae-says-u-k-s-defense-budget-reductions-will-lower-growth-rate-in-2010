BAE Systems Plc , Europe’s largest
defense company, said it expects “some reduction” in growth
for 2010 from the U.K.’s defense budget review and the effect
could mean a 1 penny cut in earnings per share from next year.  The company has eliminated about 7,000 jobs so far this
year as part of a savings drive, it said in a statement today.
The outlook for the year depends on finding a buyer for three
offshore patrol vessels that were initially built for Trinidad
and Tobago before the islands sought to cancel the order.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  said the U.K. will scrap an
order for BAE’s Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft. In a speech to
parliament on Oct. 19, he also said both new aircraft carriers
will be built. BAE is part of a group including Babcock
International Group Plc and Thales SA which will construct the
carriers at a cost of 4.9 billion pounds ($7.74 billion).  “The group anticipates some modest impact on performance
of its U.K. business in 2010 from the changes and a reduction in
the group’s financial planning assumptions resulting in an
approximately one pence reduction in earnings per share, per
annum, thereafter,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
