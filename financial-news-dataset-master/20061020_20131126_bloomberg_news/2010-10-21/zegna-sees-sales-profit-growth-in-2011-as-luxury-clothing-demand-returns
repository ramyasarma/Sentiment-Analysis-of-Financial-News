Ermenegildo Zegna , the century-old
Italian maker of men’s suits, expects revenue and profit to rise
next year as it opens at least 20 new stores, half of which will
be in China, the company’s chief executive officer said.  Sales will grow “well above 10 percent” this year, led by
Zegna’s biggest market of China and exceed the 870.6 million
euros ($1.22 billion) generated in 2008, CEO  Ermenegildo Zegna 
also said today in a telephone interview. While the Trivero,
Italy-based company’s margins are improving, 2010 profit will be
below the 62.3 million euros earned in 2008, Zegna said.  “The recovery is faster than we expected,” said Zegna,
who in January forecast low-single-digit sales growth. All
growth is coming from its retail business, which is rising more
than 20 percent, the executive said, adding that he expects that
trend to continue.  Sales of luxury goods may climb this year to the highest
level since 2007, led by demand in China and a rebound in the
U.S., consulting firm Bain & Co. said this week. Zegna’s net
income in 2009 declined to 17.3 million euros as sales fell to
797 million euros, hurt by falling demand in the U.S. and Japan,
the suitmaker said in April. Zegna’s 2010 sales won’t exceed
2007’s record, the CEO said today.  European sales are improving, with Spain being the only
country that’s not growing, Zegna said. There is “solid
growth” in Korea, the Middle East and Brazil, and a gradual
recovery in eastern Europe including Russia, he said. Revenue
growth in China will be between 30 percent and 40 percent this
year, Zegna said.  Watches  After introducing limited-edition timepieces priced at
about $30,000 to mark the company’s centennial this year, Zegna
said Oct. 7 it was extending its partnership with Sowind Group
to include watch collections starting in 2011. The aim is to
sell timepieces with Sowind mechanics priced at 5,000 euros to
10,000 euros in about 80 stores, the CEO said today.  “The market for luxury watches is rising extremely fast,”
Zegna said.  Zegna plans to open 10 stores in India in the next three
years after signing a joint venture with Reliance Brands Ltd. in
September, the executive said. Zegna is also preparing a joint
venture in Vietnam, which it hasn’t yet finalized, he said
without disclosing the potential partner.  Zegna will open its first e-commerce site in December,
targeting Europe, North America and Japan, the executive said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
