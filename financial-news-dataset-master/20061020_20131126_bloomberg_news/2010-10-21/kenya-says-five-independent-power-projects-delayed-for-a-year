Five independent power-producer
projects in Kenya, with a combined capacity of 600 megawatts,
have been delayed for “more than a year”, Mines and Energy
Ministry Permanent Secretary Patrick Nyoike said.  The projects include the 300-megawatt Turkana wind farm, an
extension to a geothermal plant and three diesel-power
facilities, Nyoike said at a conference today in Nairobi, the
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
