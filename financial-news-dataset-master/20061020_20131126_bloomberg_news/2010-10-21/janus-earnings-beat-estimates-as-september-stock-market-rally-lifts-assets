Janus Capital Group Inc. , owner of
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, said third-quarter profit
rose more than analysts estimated as the September stock-market
rally boosted asset-management fees and the firm cut expenses.  Net income quadrupled to $32.5 million, or 18 cents a
share, from $8.2 million, or 5 cents, a year earlier, when legal
settlements and severance payments reduced profit, the Denver-
based company said today in a statement. Results beat the 16-
cent average estimate of 10 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Janus, which invests about 90 percent of assets in
equities, benefited as the Standard & Poor’s  500 Index  gained
8.8 percent last month, the best September since 1939. Market
performance lifted asset under management by 9.2 percent from
the previous quarter, even as clients withdrew a net $2.9
billion.  “They are a leveraged play on the equities market,”
 Greggory Warren , an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago, said in an interview before results were announced.  The Intech quantitative investment unit lost $2.1 billion
to withdrawals, bringing net redemptions at the unit to about
$7.9 billion for the year. Intech, which uses mathematical
models to pick investments, has been losing clients after its
strategies underperformed their benchmarks. Stock funds lost
$1.8 billion in the quarter, while investors made net deposits
of $1 billion to fixed-income funds.  Cutting Compensation  Revenue increased 7.1 percent compared with a year earlier
to $243.8 million, driven by a 9.1 percent jump in investment
management fees, reflecting higher assets. Assets increased 5.9
percent from a year earlier, to $160.8 billion.  Expenses fell 5.7 percent to $186.7 million, mainly because
of an 11 percent drop in employee compensation and benefits.  BlackRock Inc ., the world’s largest money manager, said
yesterday third-quarter net income rose 74 percent to $551
million after the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors more
than doubled the assets it manages for investors.  Janus recorded a $20.5 million charge in the third quarter
of 2009 for a legal settlement and a $12.1 million loss to cover
the severance payment of former Chief Executive Officer  Gary Black , who quit in July 2009.  Janus reported earnings before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Its stock has declined 14 percent this year, while the
15-member Standard & Poor’s  index  of asset managers and custody
banks was little changed.  (Janus will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. New York
time. The call-in number is +1-877-301-7574 in the U.S. and
Canada and +1-706-643-3623 elsewhere.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
