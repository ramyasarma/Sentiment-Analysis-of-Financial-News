Boeing Co.  may take over work from
Finmeccanica’s Alenia unit building the horizontal tails for the
second variant of the 787 Dreamliner, the Seattle Times
reported, citing Boeing’s head of the commercial jet unit.  The company is “taking a very hard look” where tails for
its 787-9 should be built, the newspaper cited  Jim Albaugh  as
saying yesterday. Boeing is still discussing the subject with
Alenia and is examining the contract, he was cited as saying.  In June, Boeing grounded test flights of its 787-8 model so
that tails built by Alenia could be inspected on completed jets,
the newspaper said. As tail work continues on the planes inside
the factory, tails of flight-test aircraft are still being
modified, according to the report.  Finmeccanica declined to comment on the article.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
