The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell against most major counterparts after Chinese
reports backed the case for Asia’s largest economy to take more
tightening measures.  Australia’s currency fell for the fourth time in five days
versus the U.S. dollar as China’s government said gross domestic
product expanded faster than economists forecast and inflation
accelerated to the quickest pace in 23 months. New Zealand
dollar’s dropped against 15 of 16 of the most-traded currencies
as a report showed consumer confidence declined.  “When people start questioning the future growth of China
that is going to affect the region and the growth currencies,
Aussie and Kiwi,” said Dean Popplewell, an analyst in Toronto
at the online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp. “China is their
biggest trading partner.”  Australia’s dollar slid 0.4 percent to 98.32 U.S. cents at
11:55 a.m. in New York from 98.71 cents yesterday, after
climbing to $1.0004 on Oct. 15, the strongest since it was
freely floated in 1983. The currency fell 0.2 percent to 79.85
yen.  New Zealand’s dollar declined 0.7 percent to 75 cents from
75.50 cents and weakened 0.5 percent to 60.89 yen.  China’s  gross domestic product  grew 9.6 percent in the
third quarter from a year earlier, topping the 9.5 percent
 estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey. Consumer prices rose 3.6
percent in October, after gaining 3.5 percent the prior month,
the statistics bureau said in Beijing.  Lending, Deposit Rates  “Most interesting is consumer inflation,”  Roland Randall ,
a fixed-income and foreign-exchange strategist at TD Securities
Inc. in Singapore, wrote in a research note. This “will fuel
speculation of further monetary-policy tightening before the end
of this year.”  China’s central bank increased its lending and deposit
rates on Oct. 19. The one-year deposit rate climbed to 2.5
percent from 2.25 percent, the central bank said on its website.  New Zealand’s dollar fell after an index compiled by ANZ
National Bank Ltd. and Roy Morgan Research showed consumer
confidence declined to 113.6 this month from 116.4 in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
