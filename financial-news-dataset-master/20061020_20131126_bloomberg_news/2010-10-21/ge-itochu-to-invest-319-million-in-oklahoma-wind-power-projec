(Corrects to show Itochu is investing in a GE project worth
$319 million in first paragraph. This story was first published
on Oct. 21.)  Itochu Corp. bought an undisclosed
portion of General Electric Co.’s stake in a wind-energy project
in Oklahoma, the Japanese company said in a statement. The
project is valued at about $319 million, the statement said.  The companies have an option to invest an additional $100
million when the plant is completed in December, the Japanese
trading house said in a statement on its website today. The 152-
megawatt wind farm will comprise 66 sets of 2.3-megawatt
turbines, the companies said.  The project is part of an alliance to expand renewable-
energy businesses the two companies announced in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
