U.S. DVD purchases fell about 16
percent through nine months of 2010, a casualty of the economy
and changing tastes, based on data from the Digital
Entertainment Group, a studio-backed trade association.  Total spending on films and TV shows declined 4 percent to
$12.6 billion, the  Los Angeles-based group  said today in an e-
mailed statement. DVD purchases tumbled to about $5.57 billion
from $6.66 billion a year earlier, the report shows.  Consumers are adopting new ways of watching films, from

there are a number of positive trends emerging,”  Ron Sanders ,
head of DEG and president of Warner Home Video, said in the
statement. “Blu-ray continues to show strong growth in every
category, new release packaged media sell-through is up, and

percent to $1 billion, and new releases also gained, Sanders
said in the statement.  Online spending increased 37 percent to $432 million and
video-on-demand gained 20 percent to $1.2 billion, the group
reported.  Rental Revenue  The group said rental spending declined 4.4 percent to $4.4
billion through nine months, based on revised data supplied by

third-quarter profit increased 26 percent to $38 million, or 70
