Xerox Corp. , the printer and
business-services provider, raised its 2011 profit forecast and
said it plans additional cost cuts, including the elimination of
2,500 jobs.  Per-share profit next year, excluding some costs,  will be 
$1.05 to $1.10, compared with the previous projection of at most
$1.05, Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox said today in a
statement. Analysts had estimated $1.08 on average.  The job cuts, about 2 percent of the workforce, will come
in the next 12 months, spokesman  Carl Langsenkamp  said in an
interview. They are in addition to 2,500 positions Xerox said it
would eliminate in January. The company plans $400 million in
restructuring charges this year, up from its earlier projection
of $280 million.  Chief Executive Officer  Ursula Burns  is cutting costs after
her $6 billion purchase of Affiliated Computer Services Inc.,
while building services and printer sales as customers resume
spending after the recession. Sales for the third quarter
climbed 48 percent to $5.43 billion, compared with the average
analyst estimate of $5.46 billion.  Net income increased to $250 million, or 17 cents a share,
from $123 million, or 14 cents,  a year earlier , before Xerox
purchased ACS, the company said. Per-share profit, excluding
some costs, was 22 cents, compared with the average  estimate  of
21 cents from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Profit this year, excluding some costs, will be 92 cents
per share to 93 cents, the company said, compared with analysts’
average estimate of 92 cents. Xerox’s adjusted per-share profit
excludes items such as restructuring and acquisition costs.  Xerox gained 15 cents to $11.24 at 9:53 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares  had climbed  31
percent this year before today.  The company is also using ACS services, such as automating
administrative tasks, to further trim its costs. The company is
on track to save more than $100 million this year as a result of
the acquisition, Burns said in July. The savings may top $375
million in three years, Xerox said during an investor briefing
in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
