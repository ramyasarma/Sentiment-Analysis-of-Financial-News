Barwa Real Estate Co.,  Qatar’s
biggest publicly traded property developer by assets, said nine-
month profit rose 25 percent as rental income more than doubled.  Net income climbed to 775.6 million riyals ($213 million)
from 622.6 million riyals a year earlier, Barwa said in a
statement to the  Qatar Exchange website  today. Rental income
rose to 289.2 million riyals from 121.5 million riyals.  Barwa may benefit from economic growth in Qatar, the
world’s biggest producer of liquefied natural gas. The country’s
economy will expand by 18 percent this year, double last year’s
growth, according to government projections.  The developer recorded 914.9 million riyals in gains in
August after the government approved a request to free it from
obligations under Islamic financing contracts provided by Qatari
banks and related finance costs.  Barwa said in August that it halted two projects, one in Al
Khor and the other in Doha, worth a combined $9.2 billion until
the market improves. The company’s shareholders include Qatar’s
sovereign wealth fund.  Barwa gained 0.9 to 32.3 riyals at 10.21 a.m. on the Qatar
Exchange. The shares have declined 2.1 percent this year, while
the  QE Index  has risen 11 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
