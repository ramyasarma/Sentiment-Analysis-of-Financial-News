Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger said
he’s confident captain Cesc Fabregas will stay at the north
London club for “a few more years,” Sky Sports reported.  Fabregas, 23, has repeatedly been linked with a return to
Barcelona, the club from which he joined Arsenal as a 16-year-
old in 2003.  “Barcelona has an attraction, because he grew up there,
but I believe he wants to win with this club,” Wenger was cited
as telling shareholders at the club’s annual meeting at the
Emirates Stadium. “For how long? You never know, but hopefully
for many years. It is about our potential to win also, how well
he can do. I am not pessimistic about him, and I am confident we
will keep him for a few more years.”  Arsenal hasn’t won a trophy since the F.A. Cup in 2005.
It’s currently third in the Premier League, five points behind
leader Chelsea.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
