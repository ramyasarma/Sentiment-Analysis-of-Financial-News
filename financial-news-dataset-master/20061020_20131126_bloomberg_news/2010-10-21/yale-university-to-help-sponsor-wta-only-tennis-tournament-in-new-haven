Yale University is among four
sponsors for the WTA Tour’s  New Haven Open at Yale , which
replaces a joint men’s and women’s tennis tour stop leading up
to the U.S. Open.  The tournament and partnership, announced today, takes the
place of the Pilot Pen Tennis at Yale tournament, a feature on
the women’s  WTA  and men’s ATP tours since 1996. Pilot Pen
withdrew its sponsorship following this year’s tournament and
will be replaced by Yale,  Aetna Inc. ,  American Express Co.  and
the Yale-New Haven Hospital.  The 2011 tournament is scheduled for Aug. 19-27, one week
before the U.S. Open, and will remain a part of the U.S. Open
Series, a stretch of warm-up events for the season’s final Grand
Slam tournament.  “Yale is delighted to partner with Aetna, American
Express, and Yale-New Haven Hospital to ensure that this
important event remains in New Haven and contributes to the
vibrancy of our community,” university President  Richard Levin 
said in a statement on the U.S. Tennis Association’s  website .  According to the USTA, a 2008 study found the tournament
generated more that $26 million for the New Haven regional
economy. The 2010 tournament drew nearly 80,000 spectators, the
website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
