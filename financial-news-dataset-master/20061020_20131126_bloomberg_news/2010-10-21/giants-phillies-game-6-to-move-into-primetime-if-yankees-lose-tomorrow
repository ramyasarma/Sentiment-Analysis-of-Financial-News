Game 6 of the National League
Championship Series will be moved to primetime from the
afternoon on Oct. 23 if there is no American League game that
night.  The New York Yankees can force Game 7 of the AL series
against the Texas Rangers if they win tomorrow night to tie
their best-of-seven series 3-3. Game 7 then would be played in
Arlington, Texas, beginning at 8 p.m. New York time on Oct. 23,
and televised on Turner Broadcasting System Inc.’s TBS.  If the Philadelphia Phillies beat the San Francisco Giants
tonight to force Game 6 in the NLCS, and the Yankees are
eliminated in six games, the National League game will fill the
primetime spot instead of its scheduled 4 p.m. start,  Pat Courtney , a Major League Baseball spokesman, and Robert
Broderick, a spokesman for News Corp.’s Fox network, said in
telephone interviews. NL games are carried on Fox.  The scheduled NLCS Game 6 starters are  Jonathan Sanchez  and
 Roy Oswalt , who gave up the winning run in the Phillies’ 6-5
loss last night. Sanchez was 3-5 with a 3.59 earned run average
in day games this season and 10-4 with a 2.79 ERA in night
games. Oswalt had a 1.95 ERA during day games and a 3.20 ERA at
night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
