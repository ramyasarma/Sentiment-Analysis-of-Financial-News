Manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region expanded in October for the first time in three months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s  general economic 
index rose to 1.0 from minus 0.7 a month earlier. Readings
greater than zero suggest expansion in the area covering eastern
Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.  Economists forecast the index would increase to 2,
according to the median of 53 projections in a Bloomberg News
survey. Estimates ranged from minus 5 to a gain to 9.  Another report from the Labor Department today showed
initial  jobless claims  declined by 23,000 to 452,000 last week,
a level that’s consistent with little improvement in the labor
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
