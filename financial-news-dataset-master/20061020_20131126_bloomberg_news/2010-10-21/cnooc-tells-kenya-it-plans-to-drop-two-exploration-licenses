Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore
energy explorer, told the Kenyan government it plans to drop
licenses to search for oil and gas in two  Kenyan  blocks by
December, an official said.  “They didn’t discover anything so they don’t want to
continue,” Mines and Energy Ministry Permanent Secretary
Patrick Nyoike said in an interview today in Nairobi, the
capital. The Chinese company had licenses to explore in block 9
in northern Kenya and L2, an inland area in the Lamu Basin.  The Chinese company worked with  Africa Oil Corp.  and  Lion
Energy Corp.  to drill an exploratory well in Block 9.  “They are saying it didn’t give results,” said Nyoike.
Africa Oil may continue exploring, he said.  Cnooc is interested in working with U.K. explorer  Tullow
Oil Plc  and Africa Oil to search in five other blocks in Kenya,
proposing to take a 20 percent stake, said Nyoike.  “Cnooc believe they have the experience to be good
partners,” Nyoike said.  Kenya has four sedimentary basins that have been divided
into 38 exploration blocks with a combined surface area of
400,000 square kilometers (156,000 square miles), Nyoike said in
July. About 24 of the blocks are being explored, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
