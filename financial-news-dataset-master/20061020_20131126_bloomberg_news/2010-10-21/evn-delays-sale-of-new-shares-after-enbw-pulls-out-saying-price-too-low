EVN AG , Austria’s second-biggest
utility, delayed a planned sale of new shares after shareholder
 EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG  said the price was too low.  The offering that started on Oct. 5 attracted investors at
the bottom of the deal’s price range of 10.50 euros ($14.61) to
13.50 euros per share, EVN said in a statement yesterday after
markets closed.  “We will again invite investors to participate in a share
sale,” Chief Executive Officer  Burkhard Hofer  said in an e-
mailed statement today, adding that he regretted EnBW’s
decision.  EVN rose 7.9 percent to 12.01 euros at the close of trading
in Vienna, marking the biggest increase since Nov. 3, 2008.  EVN had offered new shares equivalent to 10 percent of its
capital in a joint sale with a 25 percent stake owned by EnBW.
The sale attracted, at a price of 10.50 euros, more orders than
the number of shares offered, EVN said in the statement.  EnBW canceled its offering because the price “doesn’t
correspond” to the value of the shares, it said on its  website .
The German utility may still sell EVN shares from its portfolio
at a later date, according to the statement.  EVN will approach investors at a “later date on the basis
of the current offer,” EVN spokesman  Stefan Zach  said in a
telephone interview. He said the company would give more details
on the timing for the restarted deal in the coming days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
