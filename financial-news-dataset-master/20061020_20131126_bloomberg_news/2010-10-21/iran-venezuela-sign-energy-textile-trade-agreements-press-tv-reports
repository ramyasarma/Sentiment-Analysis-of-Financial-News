Iranian and Venezuelan officials
signed yesterday 11 agreements promoting co-operation in areas
including oil, natural gas, textiles, trade and public housing,
 Press TV  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Iran and Venezuela also agreed to set up a joint oil
shipping company and jointly construct petrochemical plants,
said the state-run news channel’s website. Venezuela’s state oil
company Petroleos de Venezuela SA will also participate in the
exploitation of Iran’s South Pars natural gas field, the report
said without giving details of the projects.  The signing ceremony took place in Tehran late yesterday at
the end of the two-day visit of President Hugo Chavez to the
Iranian capital, according to Press TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
