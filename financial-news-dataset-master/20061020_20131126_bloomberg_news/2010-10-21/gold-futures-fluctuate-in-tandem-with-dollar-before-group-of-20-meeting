Gold futures fluctuated in tandem
with the dollar before the Group of 20 meeting in South Korea.  The greenback fell 0.3 percent against a basket of major
currencies after gaining as much as 0.6 percent. The dollar had
tumbled 6.5 percent since Sept. 1. Global finance ministers are
planning to say members will refrain from “competitive
undervaluation” of currencies, an official from a G-20 country
said. Before today, gold climbed 23 percent this year.  “If we see dollar weakness, traders will buy gold,” said
 Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago. “We
haven’t taken out the long-term gold bulls and the dollar bears
yet.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $1.50, or 0.1
percent, to $1,345.70 an ounce at 10:15 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price dropped as much as 0.6 percent. The
metal reached a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  Silver futures for December delivery gained 10.6 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $23.97 an ounce. Earlier, the price dropped as
much as 0.9 percent.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $7.70, or 0.5
percent, to $1,695 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery jumped $8.50, or
1.5 percent, to $599.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
