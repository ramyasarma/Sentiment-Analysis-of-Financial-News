Kuwait plans to pump about 170,000
barrels a day of heavy crude oil by 2020, down from an earlier
target of 450,000 barrels a day, Kuwait Oil Co. Chairman  Sami al-Rushaid  said.  “The heavy oil target is now about 60,000 by 2015/16. This
is the first milestone,” al-Rushaid said in a phone interview
today. “Our target is about 170,000 barrels per day by 2020.”  The Persian Gulf nation’s heavy oil is mostly concentrated
in the north of the country where production would be focused,
al-Rushaid said. Kuwait has a current production capacity of
760,000 barrels a day at its northern oil fields and is
targeting a capacity of 1 million barrels by 2020, he said.  The fifth-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and holder of about 8 percent of the world’s
crude reserves, Kuwait is targeting a production capacity of 4
million barrels of oil a day by 2020.  “The heavy oil is the gap filler to reach the 4 million
capacity target,” al-Rushaid said. The country’s current
production capacity is 3.3 million barrels, he said, adding that
Kuwait complies with its OPEC quota, which is 2.2 million
barrels a day, according to Bloomberg data.  Kuwait is talking to most oil majors on enhanced technical
service agreements, al-Rushaid said. “With some of them we are
close to reaching an agreement.” He wouldn’t name the companies
Kuwait may be signing agreements with or the projects.  Exxon, Total Talks  Exxon Mobil Corp. , the world’s biggest oil company, signed
a memorandum of understanding with state-run producer Kuwait Oil
in 2007 to help the emirate produce heavy crude oil. Al-Rushaid
said in April Kuwait was holding talks with Exxon Mobil about
producing heavy oil.  Total SA  Chief Executive Officer  Christophe de Margerie 
also said in April his company was in talks with Kuwait to
develop heavy-crude deposits using advanced technology to
extract fuel from fields in the country’s north.  Kuwait, which is now focusing more on non-associated gas
production, is targeting 600 million cubic feet of non-
associated gas a day by 2013.  “By 2015/16 we will reach 1 billion” cubic feet of non-
associated gas per day, al-Rushaid said today. “Our fresh
target for 2030 is that we will have an additional 1.5 billion”
on top of the 1 billion, he said.  The country is seeking to increase its output of natural
gas for power production and started importing liquefied natural
gas last year to help fuel its power stations in order to meet
demand which is increasing at an annual rate of 8 percent. The
country now has four-year LNG supply contracts with Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and Vitol Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
