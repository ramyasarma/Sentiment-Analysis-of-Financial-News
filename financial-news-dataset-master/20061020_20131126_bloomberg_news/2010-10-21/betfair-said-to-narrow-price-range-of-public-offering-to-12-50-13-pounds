Betfair Group Ltd., a British
Internet gaming site, has narrowed the price range of its
initial public offering to 12.50 pounds to 13 pounds a share,
according to three people familiar with the sale.  The banks managing the IPO, which starts trading tomorrow,
have orders for all the available stock within the new range,
said one of the people, who declined to be named because the
information is confidential. Betfair initially set a range of 11
pounds to 14 pounds each for the 18.1 million shares in the
share sale.  At 12.50 pounds a share, Betfair will raise 226 million
pounds ($356 million). Betfair is offering the shares to
individual and institutional investors, including the company’s
management and board members, according to a term sheet obtained
by Bloomberg.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are managing
the IPO, along with Barclays Plc and Numis Securities Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
