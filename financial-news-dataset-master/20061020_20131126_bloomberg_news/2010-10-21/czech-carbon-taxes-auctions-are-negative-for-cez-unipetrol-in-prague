Czech energy companies are poised to
incur additional costs after the government announced it will
tax carbon-dioxide emissions starting next year.  Electricity producer  CEZ AS  may pay 5.4 billion koruna
($308 million), or 10 koruna a share, in the tax in the next two
years, analysts led by Milan Vanicek at Prague-based brokerage
Atlantik FT wrote in a report today. Oil refiner  Unipetrol AS 
will pay about 0.6 billion koruna, or 3 koruna per share.  Companies will have to pay a gift tax on carbon credits,
which the government now allocates for free, in the next two
years and will start buying the allowances in auctions starting
in 2013, Prime Minister  Petr Necas  said yesterday.  “The news is negative” for CEZ and Unipetrol, Vanicek
wrote in the report. “As a result of abolishing the free
distribution of emission credits between 2013 and 2020,” CEZ
may pay an additional 23.9 billion koruna, or 44 koruna per
share, and Unipetrol will incur extra costs of about 2.8 billion
koruna, or 15 koruna a share, he said.  CEZ has declined 6.6 percent in the past seven sessions
after the government said on Oct. 13 companies will have to pay
for carbon credits from 2013. It fell as much as 1.7 percent
today to 754 koruna, its lowest price since April 2009, and
traded down 0.5 percent at 763 koruna at 2:05 p.m. in Prague.
Unipetrol slid 2.5 percent to 195.1 koruna, a three-month low.  ‘Under Review’  Analyst  Petr Bartek  at  Ceska Sporitelna AS , the Czech unit
of  Erste Group Bank AG , said in a report the gift tax will cost
CEZ about 12.5 koruna per share. If the utility has to buy all
credits from 2013, it will have a “negative impact” of about
80 koruna on Ceska Sporitelna’s price estimate for CEZ, he
wrote.  “We didn’t expect that a tax on emission allowances would
be imposed for the 2011-2012 period,” Bartek wrote. “We’re
putting our target price for CEZ shares under review.” Bartek’s
latest recommendation for CEZ was “accumulate” with a 12-month
price estimate of 980 koruna, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
