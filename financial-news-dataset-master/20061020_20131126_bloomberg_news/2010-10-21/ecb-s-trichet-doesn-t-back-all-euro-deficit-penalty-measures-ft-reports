European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  hasn’t endorsed the full program of euro-
area sanctions agreed to by European Union finance ministers
this week, the Financial Times reported, citing a memo it has
seen from Trichet’s office.  Trichet requested that a draft of the new rules distributed
this week be withdrawn as it doesn’t state clearly his
objections, the FT also said. Trichet is among advocates of
tougher sanctions for members with high debt levels, the
newspaper said.   The agreement means that euro-region members will not face
automatic sanctions if they breach the stability pact in place
to monitor their government debt and budget deficit levels, the
FT said.   A representative of EU President Herman Van Rompuy said a
note on Trichet’s concerns would be included in the report.
Trichet declined to comment, the FT also said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
