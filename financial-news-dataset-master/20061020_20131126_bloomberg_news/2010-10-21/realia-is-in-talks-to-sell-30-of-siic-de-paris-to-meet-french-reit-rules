Realia Business SA  is in talks to
sell about 30 percent of its French real estate investment trust
to a REIT controlled by  Inmobiliaria Colonial SA  to comply with
tax rules. Realia and Colonial advanced in Madrid trading.  Societe Fonciere Lyonnaise SA , a property company 53
percent-owned by Barcelona-based Colonial, plans to swap two
Paris office buildings for shares of SIIC de Paris SA, the
French investment trusts said in a statement today.  The transaction would cut Realia’s stake in SIIC de Paris
to less than 60 percent. That would enable the Madrid-based
company to comply with French REIT regulations and avoid the
risk of losing tax benefits. Morgan Stanley, Commerz Real AG and
the Dassault family have all cut their stakes in French REITs
for the same reason.  The two towers that Realia plans to buy are in La Defense,
Paris’s largest business district. They have more than 48,000
square meters (517,000 square feet) of space and have been
valued at about 286 million euros ($401 million), according to
the statement.  Realia owns 84.3 percent of  SIIC de Paris  has a market
value of 529 million euros. The Spanish company must cut its
stake by the end of the year to less than 60 percent, the most
shareholders can own to qualify for tax breaks granted to REITs.  Colonial shares rose 5.6 percent to 9.5 cents, the biggest
gain since Sept. 21. Realia climbed 1.6 percent to  1.57 euros .  To contact the reporters on this story:
