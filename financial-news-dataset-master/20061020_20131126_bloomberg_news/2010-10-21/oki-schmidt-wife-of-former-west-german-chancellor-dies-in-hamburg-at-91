Loki Schmidt, the wife of former
West German Chancellor  Helmut Schmidt  who built her own
reputation as a conservationist, died at the age of 91.  Schmidt died at her home in the northern city of Hamburg
early this morning, the city government said on its  website . The
one-time first lady returned home earlier this month following a
foot operation, the Deutsche Presse-Agentur newswire said.  Loki Schmidt accompanied her husband during his eight-year
chancellorship from 1974, when  Willy Brandt  resigned following a
spy scandal, through recession and a wave of terrorist attacks
at the hands of the Red Army Faction. The two continued to make
public appearances together after his rule ended in 1982.  Born Hannelore Glaser in Hamburg on March 3, 1919, Schmidt
became a teacher. She married the future chancellor, with whom
she’d been a classmate since she was 10 years old, in 1942 while
he was a military officer in World War II.  Last year Loki Schmidt was awarded the  city of Hamburg ’s
highest honor for her work focusing on endangered plants. A type
of pineapple plant that grows in Mexico, Loki-Schmidtii spec.
nov., is named after her, according to the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
