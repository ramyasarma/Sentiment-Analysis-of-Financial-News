HSH Nordbank AG said the supervisory
board found no evidence of “culpable behavior” by employees or
the chief executive officer concerning the dismissal of former
Chief Operating Officer Frank Roth. The discussions followed a
report of inquiry into the affair by the WilmerHale law firm,
the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
