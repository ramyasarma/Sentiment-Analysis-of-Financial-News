European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  is concerned that amended European Union
fiscal rules don’t include automatic sanctions for countries
with excessive budget deficits, a spokesman said.  “The President of the ECB does not subscribe to all
elements of this report,” the spokesman said. “There’s a lack
of automatism in the proposal.”  European governments this week left decisions to sanction
euro-area budget violators in political hands, stopping short of
the more automatic crackdown on runaway deficits demanded by the
ECB. Germany, which had pushed for “quasi-automatic” sanctions
and threatened to expel chronic high-deficit countries from the
 euro region , shifted its stance to embrace French calls to
require at least two votes by euro-area governments before
penalties are imposed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
