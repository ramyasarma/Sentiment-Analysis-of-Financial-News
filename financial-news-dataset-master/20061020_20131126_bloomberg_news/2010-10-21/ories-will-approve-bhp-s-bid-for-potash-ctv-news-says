The Conservatives will approve BHP
Billiton Ltd.’s hostile bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan,
CTV News reported on its website, without saying how it obtained
the information.  Also, the Tories "will attach poison pill conditions" that
favor the Saskatchewan government’s demands to make the
acquisition economically acceptable to the province, CTV News
reported, citing CTV Ottawa Bureau Chief Robert Fife.      To contact the editor responsible for this story:
