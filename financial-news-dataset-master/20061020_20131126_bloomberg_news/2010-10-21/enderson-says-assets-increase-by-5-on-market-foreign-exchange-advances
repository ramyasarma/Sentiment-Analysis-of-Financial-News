Henderson Group Plc , the U.K. money
manager that owns New Star Asset Management Group Plc, said
assets under management rose 5 percent in the third quarter on
market and foreign exchange gains.  Managed funds climbed to 59.2 billion pounds ($94 billion)
at Sept. 30 compared with 56.4 billion pounds at July 1, the
Jersey, Channel Islands-based company said today in a statement.
Fund performance boosted assets by 3.1 billion pounds,
offsetting net outflows of 100 million pounds and a 200 million-
pound property fund transfer to  Aviva Plc ’s investment arm.  “The risk appetite of both retail and institutional
investors remains low, driven by poor economic news and
volatile, albeit improving, equity markets,” Chief Executive
Officer  Andrew Formica  said in the statement. “Henderson
continues to see healthy demand especially in our fixed income
credit products.”  Henderson’s stock has lagged behind rivals  Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc , Schroders Plc and  Jupiter Fund Management Plc  in
the second half of this year as the company considers future
acquisitions. The firm, which bought New Star in 2009, may buy
firms in emerging markets and the U.S., Formica said on a
conference call with analysts in August, without ruling out
possible U.K. purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
