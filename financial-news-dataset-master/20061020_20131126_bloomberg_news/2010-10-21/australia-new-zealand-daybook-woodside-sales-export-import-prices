---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: U.S. stocks swung between gains and losses as concern
that banks face more losses from bad mortgages and a slump in
commodity producers overshadowed optimism about higher-than-

loans from bondholders.

banks will face tighter financial regulations and as the yen

York.
*The dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to 81.33 yen.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries fell, pushing the 30-year bond yield up for

percentage point, to 3.91 percent at 1:38 p.m. in New York.  COMMODITIES  GOLD  New York: Gold futures fell on speculation that the dollar will

percent, to $3.7815 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the Comex in New

reduced fuel consumption, and as the dollar rebounded against
the euro.
