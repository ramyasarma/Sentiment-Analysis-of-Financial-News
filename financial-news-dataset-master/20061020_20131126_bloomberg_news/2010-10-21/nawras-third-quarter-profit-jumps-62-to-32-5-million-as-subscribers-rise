Nawras, the Omani mobile phone
company controlled by  Qatar Telecom QSC , posted a 62 percent
gain in third-quarter profit as the number of subscribers
increased.  Net income rose to 12.5 million rials ($32.5 million),
including one-off provisions, from 7.7 million rials a year
earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Revenue increased 13 percent to 47.7 million rials.  “Our strategies to roll out our fixed service and
continued growth in the wireless market have delivered promising
results,” Chairman  Salim Bin Mustahil Al Maashani  said in the
statement. “We anticipate continued growth from fixed services
in the fourth quarter of 2010.”  Nawras, which started operations in 2005, has a 45 percent
share of the sultanate’s mobile-phone market and competes with
 Oman Telecommunications Co.,  the largest operator in Oman. The
company is seeking to raise as much as $608 million by selling a
40 percent stake.  The number of mobile subscribers increased 13 percent in
the quarter from a year ago, Nawras said. The penetration rate
for fixed-line broadband services is between 2 percent and 10
percent in Oman, Chief Executive Officer  Ross Cormack  said in
September.  The company plans to list shares on Nov. 3, Nawras said
earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
