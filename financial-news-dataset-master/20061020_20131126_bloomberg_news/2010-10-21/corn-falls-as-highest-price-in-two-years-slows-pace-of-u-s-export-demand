Corn futures fell for the sixth time
in seven sessions after a government report showed reduced
overseas demand for supplies from the U.S., the biggest producer
and shipper.  Exporters sold  212,478 metric tons in the week ended Oct.
14, down 77 percent from a week earlier and 72 percent less than
the average of the previous four weeks, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said in a  report . Before today, corn surged 60
percent since the end of May as adverse weather reduced U.S.
production.  “Export sales were disappointing,” said  Mark Schultz , the
chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis. “High prices have increased importer reluctance to
increase purchases.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 9.25 cents, or 1.6
percent, to close at $5.6425 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after surging 5 percent yesterday. On
Oct. 13, the price reached $5.88, the highest level for a most-
active contract since August 2008.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
