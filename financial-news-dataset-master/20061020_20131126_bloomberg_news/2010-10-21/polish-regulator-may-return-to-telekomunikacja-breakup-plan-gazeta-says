Poland’s telephone regulator may
still break up Telekomunikacja Polska SA into infrastructure and
services units, arguing that the country’s largest phone company
is not meeting all the terms of an agreement last year that
suspended the process, Gazeta Wyborcza reported.  Anna Strezynska, head of the regulator, told the newspaper
that the company is getting a “C+” grade at the moment,
meeting its investment commitments while failing to improve
service quality for competitors who use its lines.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
