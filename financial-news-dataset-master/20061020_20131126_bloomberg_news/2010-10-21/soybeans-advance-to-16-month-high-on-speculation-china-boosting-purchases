Soybeans climbed to the highest
price in more than 16 months in Chicago on speculation that
China, the world’s largest importer, may boost overseas
purchases. Wheat and corn advanced.  China bought 180,000 metric tons of soybeans from the U.S.,
the Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Importers agreed
to purchase 23.3 million tons of U.S. soybeans from the start of
the marketing year on Sept. 1 through Oct. 7, up 10 percent from
a year earlier,  USDA data show .  “The Chinese are buying U.S. soybeans to sell into the
domestic market, where prices are higher,”  Ker Chung Yang , an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte in Singapore, said in an e-mailed
report today. “We would expect the voracious demand from China
to last” as long as U.S. supplies are cheaper, he said.  Soybeans for January delivery rose 6.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $12.30 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The oilseed touched $12.35, the highest
price for a most-active contract since June 5, 2009.  May-delivery soybeans in Dalian rose as much as 2.5 percent
to 4,341 yuan ($653) a ton, the highest price for the most-
active contract since Sept. 1, 2008. January-delivery Chicago
soybeans are 69 percent of the  value  of that contract, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Food Prices  Food and residential costs led the 3.6 percent increase in
China’s September consumer prices announced today,  Sheng Laiyun ,
spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a
briefing in Beijing. Food  prices  climbed 8 percent in September
from a year ago.  Imports of soybeans may total 4.65 million tons this month,
the China National Grain & Oils Information Center said in an e-
mailed report today. The volume will be almost the same as in
September and higher than the 4.16 million tons estimated by the
Ministry of Commerce, it said.  Wheat gained after Japan bought 122,861 tons of the grain,
the most in two weeks, in a tender. U.S. exporters have sold
18.3 million tons of wheat since the start of the marketing year
on June 1, up 50 percent from a year earlier, USDA figures show.  Dry weather in the U.S. southern Great Plains and eastern
Midwest, where winter-wheat varieties are grown, may limit soil
moisture and hurt recently sowed plants. About 0.5 inch of rain
is expected in the next five days, T-Storm Weather LLC said
yesterday.  ‘Dire’ Consequences?  “The soft-red winter wheat farmers are rumoring about
‘dire’ consequences, as wheat is not emerging as they had
hoped,” said economist  Dennis Gartman , editor of the Gartman
Letter. “Those farming soft-red winter wheat are nervously
waiting to see if the rains that are forecast for this week this
weekend and into early next week actually do materialize.”  Wheat for December delivery gained 1.75 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $6.8475 a bushel. The grain has climbed 43 percent
since the end of June as wet weather in Canada and the worst
drought in a half-century in Russia hurt output. Milling wheat
for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris added 0.6
percent to 211.75 euros ($296.67) a ton.  Corn for December delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.2 percent, to
$5.7425 a bushel in Chicago. The grain has jumped 16 percent
this month after a U.S. government report showed domestic output
would fall 3.4 percent, more than analysts expected.  To contact the reporters on this story:
