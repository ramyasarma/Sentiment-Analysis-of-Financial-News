Natura Cosmeticos SA , Brazil’s
largest cosmetics maker, rose to a record in Sao Paulo trading
after third-quarter profit beat forecasts and unemployment fell
to a record low.  Natura gained 3.4 percent to 49.10 reais at the 4 p.m. New
York time close. The benchmark  Bovespa  slipped 1.1 percent.  The company had net income of 191.7 million reais ($113
million), according to a filing yesterday. While this was little
changed from a year earlier, it surpassed the  average estimate 
of 187.4 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.
Sales rose 22 percent to 1.28 billion reais. That, coupled with
a stronger currency that made imports cheaper, compensated for a
jump in costs, said  Daniela Bretthauer , an analyst at Raymond
James & Associates Inc. in Sao Paulo.  “What positively surprised us is that, despite tough
comps, Natura’s sales rep count continues to grow at a fast pace
while its sales rep productivity remains positive,” Bretthauer
wrote in a note to clients today. She rates the stock “market
perform.”  Brazil’s unemployment rate fell to a record low 6.2 percent
in September, the national statistics agency said today.  A drop in the jobless rate, an increase in Brazilian
workers’ average income and higher consumer confidence boosted
Natura’s sales,  Banco Fator Corretora  analysts Renato Prado and
Ronaldo Kasinsky wrote in an Oct. 18 note. They recommend buying
the stock.  To contact the reporters on this story:
