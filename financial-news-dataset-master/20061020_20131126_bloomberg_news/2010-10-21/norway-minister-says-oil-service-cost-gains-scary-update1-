Increases in oil-services costs
offshore Norway in the past years have been “scary” and raise
the risk that “a lot” of the Nordic nation’s crude resources
will be left underground, Oil Minister  Terje Riis-Johansen  said.  “Development costs have doubled since 2004, rig rates are
about four times higher than they were in 2003, operational
costs on the Norwegian shelf have increased by 60 percent since
2000,” he said today at a conference in Oslo. “The break-even
price for new field developments typically stood at around $20 a
barrel five years ago, while today that price is $50.”  The government is urging producers such as state-controlled
 Statoil ASA  and ConocoPhillips to improve recovery from the
offshore oil deposits. Output in the world’s seventh-biggest oil
exporter has almost halved in the past decade after 40 years of
pumping oil and natural gas from fields such as Ekofisk.  “Increased recovery requires a lot of drilling and
drilling is, as everybody knows, extremely costly,” the
minister said. “We’ve had a cost development on the Norwegian
continental shelf which I actually would qualify as scary when
we look at the last years.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
