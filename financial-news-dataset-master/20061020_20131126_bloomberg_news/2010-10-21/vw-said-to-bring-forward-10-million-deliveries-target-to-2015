Volkswagen AG  aims to reach its
sales goal of 10 million vehicles three years earlier than
planned as VW tries to pass Toyota Motor Corp. as the largest
automaker, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Europe’s largest carmaker  targets more than 8 million
deliveries by 2012 and 10 million as early as 2015, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the matter isn’t
public, citing internal company documents. VW’s official goal is
to increase annual deliveries to 10 million by 2018.  “Volkswagen is well positioned in the relevant markets,”
said  Hans-Peter Wodniok , an analyst at Fairesearch GmbH & Co.
who  recommends  selling VW stock. “It seems possible for VW to
meet its goals early, provided the global economy won’t stall.”  VW, whose nine-month sales in China surged 39 percent, will
add two factories in the country as part of a 6 billion-euro
($8.4 billion) plan to  double production  in its biggest market
to 3 million cars within four years. VW will also open a plant
in Chattanooga, Tennessee, next year to supply the U.S. market
and is expanding capacity in Russia.  The carmaker is targeting a second consecutive year of
record global sales as it adds about  70 models , including
upgraded versions of existing vehicles, across its nine brands.
Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW sold 6.29 million cars, sport-
utility vehicles and light commercial vans in 2009, a gain of
1.1 percent.  Shares Rise  Volkswagen preferred shares  rose  3.24 euros, or 3.6 percent
to 93.78 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Frankfurt in
the  biggest  gain since Aug. 2. The stock has risen 44 percent
this year and is at the highest price since Sept. 23, 2008.  The carmaker’s internal plans to bring forward the 10
million-delivery goal to 2015 were reported today by  Manager
Magazin .  “We’re keeping to our 2018 target but do not rule out that
the goal can be achieved earlier,”  Michael Brendel , a VW
spokesman, said today by phone, reiterating comments made last
month by sales chief  Christian Klingler . Brendel declined to
elaborate.  Toyota  will recall 1.53 million vehicles globally to fix a
brake-related fault that may cause fluid leaks, the Japanese
company said today. About 1.34 million cars in the U.S. and
Japan will be affected by the recall. The announcement comes as
the Toyota City-based carmaker seeks to regain customer trust
and market share after recalling more than 8 million vehicles
globally for defects linked to unintended acceleration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
