Statoil ASA, Norway’s largest oil
and gas company, will raise as much as 5.4 billion kroner ($920
million) in the initial public offering for its gas station and
fuel unit, Norway’s biggest share sale in more than four years.  The offering, priced at 39 kroner a share, was “several
times” oversubscribed, the Stavanger-based company said in a
statement today. The company will sell as many as 120 million
shares in Statoil Fuel & Retail ASA and the underwriters will
exercise their option for an additional 18 million.  The shares are expected to begin trading on the Oslo Stock
Exchange tomorrow. About 93 percent of the stock went to
institutional investors and the remaining 7 percent to retail
investors, including employees, Statoil said. The company will
retain 54 percent of Scandinavia’s biggest gas-station operator
if all the shares are allotted.  Statoil  initially aims to keep control of the company,
which runs about 2,300 service stations in eight countries and
sells aviation and marine fuels.  Statoil, which has operating rights on about 80 percent of
Norway’s oil and gas production, is raising funds to expand
abroad to counter dwindling North Sea reserves. The public
listing would be the largest in Norway since Renewable Energy
Corp.’s $1.12 billion listing in May 2006.  Statoil’s shares  rose  1.2 kroner, or 1 percent, to 127.5
kroner as of 5:25 p.m. in Oslo. The stock has declined 12
percent this year.  The joint bookrunners are ABG Sundal Collier ASA, Citigroup
Inc. and Bank of America Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
