Provident Financial Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest subprime lender, fell the most in 12 weeks after the
government outlined plans for the biggest spending cuts on
record.  Provident Financial  dropped  26.5 pence, or 3.3 percent, to
773 pence at in London trading, the biggest decline since July
27. That values the lender at about 1.1 billion pounds ($1.7
billion). Half of the firm’s customers receive social security
benefits, according to the company.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced plans
yesterday to shrink welfare payments by 11 billion pounds, an
overall cut of about 8 percent in the bill for unemployment aid,
housing assistance, disability payments and pensions. Provident
typically lends between 300 pounds and 500 pounds to people who
have been refused credit by larger banks such as Lloyds Banking
Group Plc and Barclays Plc.  “The welfare budget will take a larger proportion of the
81 billion pounds of cuts than we had expected,”  Robin Savage ,
a London-based analyst at Collins Stewart Plc with a “sell”
rating on the stock, wrote in a note to clients today. “The
austerity measures will have a major impact on Provident
Financial’s customers.”  Provident Financial is scheduled to publish its third-
quarter interim management statement tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
