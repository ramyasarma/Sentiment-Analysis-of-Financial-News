Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said U.S. President  Barack Obama  is trying to “sow doubt”
about the South American country’s plans to build a nuclear
power station with Russia’s help.  Obama told Spanish-language media in Washington on Oct. 19
he had no problem with Venezuela’s plan as long as it acts
responsibly.  “Mr. Obama gave some declarations the day before yesterday
about the contract we signed with Moscow to develop in Venezuela
our first little nuclear reactor,” Chavez told reporters in
Damascus, where he was visiting Syrian President  Bashar Al- Assad . “It’s going to be little, don’t be frightened.”  Russia’s state-run nuclear holding company, Rosatom Corp.,
agreed to help build Venezuela’s first nuclear power plant after
talks in Moscow between Chavez and President  Dmitry Medvedev .  Venezuela plans to generate 4,000 megawatts of electricity
through the use of nuclear energy, Electricity Minister  Ali Rodriguez  told reporters today in Caracas. The project with
Russia will probably take 10 years to complete, he said.  Chavez, on a 10-day tour of Belarus, Russia, Iran, Syria,
Libya and Portugal, said criticisms that he is forming alliances
with states that sponsor terrorism were unfounded.  “The axis of evil? The more they attack me about all of
that the more I will come to Damascus, the more I will go to
Belarus, the more I will go to Tehran to prove that we are
free,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
