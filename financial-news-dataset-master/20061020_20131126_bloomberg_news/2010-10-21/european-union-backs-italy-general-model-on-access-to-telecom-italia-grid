The European Commission said it
agreed with the Italian regulator’s general approach to basing
wholesale prices for access to Telecom Italia’s network, though
it has “concerns.”  “The commission has expressed its concerns that” the
regulator “has not consistently applied this model to calculate
the prices which alternative operators would be charged for
accessing Telecom Italia’s network,” the commission said today
in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
