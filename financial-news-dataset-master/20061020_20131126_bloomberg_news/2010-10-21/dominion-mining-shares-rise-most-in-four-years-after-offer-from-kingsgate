Dominion Mining Ltd. , an Australian
gold producer, rose the most in four years in Sydney trading
after agreeing yesterday to a A$340 million ($334 million)
share-based takeover bid from  Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd.   Dominion closed up 16 percent at A$3.16 on the Australian
stock exchange, the biggest gain since Oct. 19, 2006. Kingsgate
fell 9.4 percent to A$10.61, the most since Dec. 4 2008.
Kingsgate offered 0.31 of its shares for every one Dominion
share. The bid, based on today’s closing prices, values Dominion
at A$3.29 a share.  Dominion owns the Challenger gold mine in South Australia
and gold and base metals projects in Western Australia. Sydney-
based  Kingsgate , the second-largest gold producer by market
value on the exchange, operates the Chatree mine in Thailand.  Global gold mining takeovers are at a record this year as
producers are discovering less metal while the bullion price has
advanced each year since 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Elisabeth Behrmann  in
