Toshiba Corp ., the world’s second-
biggest maker of flash memory, said first-half profit exceeded
the company’s forecast, helped by demand for chips that store
data in smartphones and tablet computers.  Net income  during the six months ended Sept. 30 was about
27 billion yen ($333 million), compared with a 57.7 billion yen
loss a year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said today in a
statement. Profit exceeded Toshiba’s previous 10 billion yen
forecast and was 48 percent higher than the average analyst
estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said earnings from NAND flash memory were
higher than the company had anticipated and the liquid-crystal
display operations returned to profit.  Apple Inc.  this week 
reported record sales and profit, led by sales of the iPhone 
and iPad.  Toshiba fell 2.2 percent to close at 408 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange before the announcement, while the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
