Applications for U.S. unemployment
benefits fell last week to a level that’s consistent with little
improvement in the labor market.  Initial  jobless claims  declined by 23,000 to 452,000 in the
week ended Oct. 15, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The  total  number of people receiving unemployment
insurance fell, while those getting extended payments rose.  The pace of firings has persisted since the start of the
year, indicating it will take longer to reduce an unemployment
rate that’s near a 26-year high. A Federal Reserve report
yesterday showed the economy is growing at a “modest pace”
with companies still hesitant to hire, a reason central bankers
may ease monetary policy.  “The rate of layoffs remains unpleasantly high, capping
spending growth and keeping the consumer cautious,”  David Semmens , an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York,
said before the report.  Economists forecast claims would fall to 455,000 from a
previously reported 462,000 the prior week, according to the
median of 47 projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates
ranged from 430,000 to 465,000.  A Labor Department spokesman said several states had
estimated claims for the prior week because they couldn’t
provide actual figures. The final tallies turned out to be
higher than what they had initially provided to the Labor
Department.  The four-week moving average of claims, a less volatile
measure, fell to 458,000 from 462,250.  Continuing Claims  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
fell by 9,000 in the week ended Oct. 9 to 4.44 million, the
lowest since June 26.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended and emergency benefits under
federal programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional
benefits and are now collecting  emergency  and  extended  payments
increased by about 279,000 to 5.07 million in the week ended
Oct. 2.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 3.5 percent in
the week ended Oct. 9.  Fifty-one states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while two reported a decline. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Companies in September added 64,000 workers, while total
payrolls that include governments fell a larger-than-forecast
95,000, Labor Department figures showed Oct. 8.  September Payrolls  The drop in U.S. payrolls in September largely reflected
local governments firing educators and other workers to make up
for declining tax revenue. Struggles to keep state and local
government budgets balanced likely will continue to weigh on job
growth and sustain the level of weekly jobless claims.  Private companies are still firing workers.  Aon Corp ., the
world’s biggest insurance broker, plans to cut 1,500 to 1,800
jobs globally as it integrates businesses after the acquisition
of consulting firm Hewitt Associates Inc., the Chicago-based
firm said Oct. 14 in a regulatory filing.  “There are going to be some redundancies as part of this”
acquisition, Chief Executive Officer  Gregory Case  told analysts
in a July conference call.  Some firms are hiring.  Delta Air Lines Inc . is adding 1,000
flight attendants, many of them to work on more profitable
international routes, as global demand for travel improves.  About 600 of the positions will be new hires and Delta has
received 85,000 applications, Betsy Talton, a spokeswoman for
the Atlanta-based company, said this week.  The company first offered the jobs to attendants who were
on furlough and 425 accepted, Chief Executive Officer Richard
Anderson said in his weekly recorded message to employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
