Japanese  stocks  declined for a
second day on speculation banks will face tighter financial
regulations and as the yen remained close to a 15-year high.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,  Japan’s largest
publicly traded bank, dropped 1 percent. Central Japan Railway
Co., the nation’s second-biggest railroad by sales, tumbled 5.7
percent after the government said a planned magnetic-levitation
line may cost more than the company forecast. TDK Corp., the
world’s biggest maker of magnetic heads for disk drives, fell
1.3 percent.  Canon Inc. , a camera maker that gets about 80
percent of its revenue overseas, slid 0.9 percent.  The Topix index dropped 0.4 percent to 820.40 at the close
in Tokyo, with more than twice as many shares declining as
advancing. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell less than 0.1
percent to 9,376.48.  “Until the capital regulations are determined, there will
be concern that banks will raise additional funds,” said  Takeru Ogihara , chief strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co. “The
yen’s strength is a factor. Moves of Japanese stocks are linked
to currencies.”  A Credit Suisse Group AG report dated Oct. 20 said there is
concern in the market that regulations of the financial industry
will be tightened and that a capital surcharge will be imposed
on banks with international operations.  Mitsubishi UFJ  fell 1 percent to 383 yen, contributing the
second-most to the Topix’s decline, after Central Japan Railway.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest
publicly traded bank, slid 0.6 percent and Mizuho Financial
Group Inc., the No. 3, lost 0.8 percent. Banks were the largest
drag on the Topix among its 33 industry groups.  Railway Operators  Central Japan Railway tumbled 5.7 percent to 609,000 yen
and had the largest drop in the Nikkei 225. The company’s
planned maglev line, scheduled for completion by 2027, may cost
5.5 trillion yen ($68 billion), according to a report released
by the transport ministry yesterday. JR Central, which plans to
fund the project itself, expects the line to cost 5.1 trillion
yen, Michiko Ishizu, a spokeswoman, said by phone today.  West Japan Railway Co. , the nation’s third-largest rail
operator by market value, sank 3.3 percent to 295,500 yen, the
steepest decline since April 28. The company was rated
“underweight” in new coverage at Barclays Capital.  TDK, which receives a third of its annual sales in China,
sank 1.3 percent to 4,575 yen.  Canon Inc. , the world’s biggest
camera maker, retreated 0.9 percent to 3,725 yen. They were the
two biggest drags on the Nikkei.  The yen appreciated to a 15-year high of 80.85 against the
dollar around midnight yesterday in Tokyo, compared with 81.38
at the close of stock trading yesterday. The currency traded at
81.15 as of 3 p.m. today. Exporters also declined after data
showed China’s inflation accelerated and economic growth slowed.  To contact the reporters for this story:
