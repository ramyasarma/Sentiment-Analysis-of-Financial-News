South Korea’s won rose for a second
day on optimism the Federal Reserve will boost the supply of
dollars to sustain a recovery in the world’s largest economy.  Gains in the currency, the best performer of the past month
in Asia excluding Japan, were limited before reports that
economists predict will show China’s inflation accelerated to
the fastest pace in almost two years in September and economic
growth moderated in the third quarter. Rising prices may lead to
further monetary tightening in China, which is South Korea’s
biggest export market and this week raised interest rates for
the first time in three years.  “The won is influenced” by prospects of quantitative
easing by the Fed, said  Sam Hong , a currency dealer at Shinhan
Bank in Seoul. If China’s “data is not good, it can change the
market situation. The market is focused on Chinese consumption
and its influence on the global economy.”  The won traded at 1,126.56 per dollar as of 9:48 a.m. in
Seoul, from 1,126.95 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency, which has advanced 2.9 percent in the
past month, may trade between 1,115 and 1,129 today, Hong
predicted.  The Fed said in its Beige Book business survey yesterday
that U.S. economic growth showed little sign of acceleration
last month, fueling speculation it will boost purchases of
government debt. A report today is forecast to show a gauge of
leading indicators failed to accelerate last month, based on the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
