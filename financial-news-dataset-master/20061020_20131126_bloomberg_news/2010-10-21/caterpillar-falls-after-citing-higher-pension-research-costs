Caterpillar Inc. , the world’s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, fell in New
York trading after saying it expects cost “headwinds” in 2011.  Caterpillar predicted higher expenses for pensions, retiree
health benefits, research and development and tax, the Peoria,
Illinois-based company said in a statement today.  Sales will “approach” $50 billion next year, from $41
billion to $42 billion in 2010. Caterpillar said it has more
work to do before providing 2011 earnings guidance.  Doug Oberhelman , who succeeded  Jim Owens  on July 1 as chief
executive officer, is targeting $8 to $10 a share in profit on
sales of as much as $60 billion in 2012. He’s aiming to pull 25
cents of profit from every new dollar of sales.  “People are worried about the incremental margin in 2011”
after the company’s comments on costs, said  Stephen Volkmann , an
analyst for Jefferies & Co. in New York who has a “buy” rating
on the shares.  Caterpillar  fell 99 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $78.89 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  “Some investors may have underestimated the impact of
rising pension, healthcare, and commodity costs would have on
the outlook,”  Joel Levington , a managing director of corporate
credit at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York,
said in an e-mail. Rising metals prices may increase costs for
Caterpillar, he said.  2010 Forecast  The company raised its full-year earnings forecast and
posted third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  Net Income  rose 96 percent to $792 million, or $1.22 a
share, from $404 million, or 64 cents, a year earlier. That beat
the $1.09-a-share average of 21 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales climbed 53 percent to $11.1 billion from $7.3
billion.  Profit for 2010 will be $3.80 to $4 a share, up from a July
forecast of $3.15 to $3.85, Caterpillar said. The average of 23
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was for $3.76 a share.  The shares also may have fallen because investors were
looking for Caterpillar to beat the average of analysts’
estimates by a greater margin, Volkmann said.  “The beat was a little weak and expectations were high,”
he said.  The company’s 2010 revenue forecast was raised from a
previous outlook of $39 billion to $42 billion. Caterpillar has
announced plans in the past five months to build factories in
Brazil and China, where economic growth is outpacing the U.S.  Emerging Markets  “It’s truly a story of emerging markets,”  Brian Rayle , a
Cleveland-based analyst at Northcoast Research who has a
“neutral” rating on the shares, said in an interview. “Demand
looks like it’s better in this year and 2011.”  Sales from Caterpillar’s  machines  business, which makes
excavators, bulldozers, haul trucks and loaders, rose 84 percent
to $7.2 billion in the quarter. Engine sales climbed 21 percent
to $3.25 billion while financial-product revenue fell 5 percent
to $682 million.  “The numbers are better across the board, in machinery and
engines,”  Eli Lustgarten , an analyst for Longbow Research in
Independence, Ohio, who has a “neutral” rating on the shares,
said in an interview. “It’s a solid beat.”  Global  employment  was 102,336 at the end of the quarter,
including about 2,300 full-time workers, following the
acquisition of Electro-Motive Diesel. The company added 6,200
full-time employees this year, primarily because of production
increases, and about 9,000 part-time, agency and temporary
workers.  Growth Prediction  Caterpillar cut about 19,000 full-time jobs and 18,000
part-time and temporary workers from late 2008 through the end
of last year after demand plunged during the recession.  The company today forecast world economic growth in 2010
and next year will be more than 3.5 percent. The U.S. may expand
2.5 percent this year and 3 percent next year while developing
countries may grow about 7 percent in 2010 and 6.5 percent in
2011, the company said. Growth in China may moderate in 2011 to
about 9.5 percent from 10.5 percent, it said.  Caterpillar said it expects the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
will increase liquidity in the fourth quarter and the European
Central Bank will hold its current policy through the yearend
even though turmoil in government debt markets could result in
additional bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
