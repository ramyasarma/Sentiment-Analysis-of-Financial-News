Gold fluctuated in New York as the
dollar weakened, increasing demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment.  The dollar fell against the euro after yesterday slumping
the most in more than three months. Gold futures, which usually
move inversely to the greenback, reached a record $1,388.10 an
ounce on Oct. 14. The dollar gained earlier today after reported
comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner 
suggested he sees no need for further weakness in the currency.  Gold will be supported by “the prospect of additional
quantitative easing and from the weaker dollar,”  Tom Pawlicki ,
an analyst at  MF  Global Ltd. in Chicago, said in a report.
“Pressure will be offered by signs that the long-term rally may
be a bit overdone.”  Gold futures for December delivery added $1.20, or 0.1
percent, to $1,345.40 an ounce at 8 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices swung between a loss of 0.2 percent and a gain of
0.4 percent. Bullion for immediate delivery in London was 0.1
percent lower at $1,345.18. Spot prices reached an all-time high
$1,387.35 on Oct. 14.  Bullion rose to $1,345.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,339 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Gold, up 23 percent this year, is heading for a 10th annual
gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in London.
Bullion has outperformed global equities, Treasuries and most
industrial metals, prompting record investment in gold-backed
exchange-traded products. Gold has gained on speculation the
Federal Reserve will next month announce asset purchases to
revive the U.S. economy.  Group of 20  Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in
South Korea on Oct. 22-23 for talks on how to keep the global
recovery progressing amid concern that countries may be vying
with each other to weaken their currencies. Geithner said that
he’ll use the meeting to help “rebalance” the world economy to
be less reliant on U.S. consumers, according to a Wall Street
Journal report.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. raised its
December gold price forecast by 7 percent to $1,420 an ounce,
according to an e-mailed report. Prices may peak at $1,550 by
September next year, the bank said.  “Rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will
introduce further quantitative easing paints a negative outlook
for the U.S. dollar and a positive outlook for gold,” wrote
 Mark Pervan  and  Natalie Robertson , based in Melbourne. Fed
policy makers meet next on Nov. 2-3.  ‘Elevated Levels’  Gold will “remain at elevated levels for years” as
investors keep bullion as a diversification asset,  HSBC Holdings
Plc  analyst James Steel said today in a report. The bank raised
its 2011 forecast for average prices to $1,425, from $1,025.  China’s economy grew 9.6 percent in the third quarter, the
smallest gain in a year, as inflation quickened to 3.6 percent
in September to the fastest pace in 23 months, according to data
released today. The increase in gross domestic product from a
year earlier topped economists’ median 9.5 percent estimate.  “China’s growth is very much in place and as a result of
that all commodities are going to be very much in demand,” said
 Gavin Wendt , senior resource analyst at MineLife Pty in Sydney.
“The Chinese have made a strategic decision over the past year
to invest more heavily in gold to diversify their foreign
reserves away from the U.S. dollar and also encourage their
private citizens to effectively invest in gold.”  Silver for December delivery in New York gained 0.2 percent
to $23.915 an ounce. Futures reached $24.95 on Oct. 14, the
highest level since March 1980. The metal will average $20 next
year, HSBC said.  Platinum for January delivery lost 0.2 percent to $1,684.40
an ounce. Palladium for December delivery added 0.5 percent to
$593.40 an ounce. The metal reached $606.25 on Oct. 7, the
highest price since June 2001. Platinum will average $1,750 and
palladium $675 in 2011, HSBC said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
