Tullow Oil Plc , the U.K. explorer
focused on Africa, fell to the lowest in six weeks after an
exploration well in offshore Ghana failed to find oil.  The Onyina-1 well in the Campanian prospect, between the
Tweneboa and Jubilee fields in the deepwater Tano license,
encountered water-bearing reservoirs, the company said in a
statement in London today. The  shares  closed down 2.1 percent at
1,227 pence, the lowest since Sept. 6.  “The lack of hydrocarbons at this location highlights the
high risks of charging and trapping oil in this secondary
play,” Angus McCross, exploration director at Tullow, said in
the statement.  Tullow has fallen 6 percent this year after Ghana blocked
the sale of Kosmos Energy LLC’s stake in the Jubilee field to
 Exxon Mobil Corp.  and plans to start pumping from fields in
Uganda were delayed by a tax dispute. Jubilee was discovered in
2007 and has potential resources of 1.8 billion barrels, one of
the biggest finds in Africa.  Today’s report “is disappointing but does not change our
stance on the shares,” said  Peter Hitchens , an analyst at
Panmure Gordon & Co., in an e-mailed note to investors. “The
company is still in an active drilling program which can add
significant shareholder value.”  Tullow, with partners Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Kosmos and
Ghana National Petroleum Corp., is investing about $3.35 billion
to develop the Jubilee field. The first phase is expected to
start pumping 120,000 barrels of oil a day in the first half of
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
