second day, advancing 358.96, or 1.2 percent, to 30,439.46 in
Johannesburg, its highest close since June 2008.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ): The price of copper, lead,
nickel, tin and zinc rose on the London Metal Exchange after a
report showed economic growth in China, the world’s largest user
of the metal, topped economists’ estimates. The diversified
mining company’s shares rose 8.48 rand, or 2.7 percent, to
321.98 rand.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s biggest
mining company, rose 3.30 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 242.40 rand.
