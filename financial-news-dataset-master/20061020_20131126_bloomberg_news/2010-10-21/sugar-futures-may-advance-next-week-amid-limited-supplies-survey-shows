Sugar futures may advance amid
forecasts for limited supplies, a survey showed.  Eight of 11 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar on ICE Futures U.S. in New York
will climb next week. Three predicted a decline. The price has
climbed 4.8 percent this week.  Brazil, the world’s largest grower, may produce less next
year because of a drought and aging fields, said  Stefan Uhlenbrock , an analyst at Ratzeburg, Germany-based researcher
F.O. Licht. Acucar Guarani SA, a Brazilian cane processor, said
that it will crush 5 percent less next year as drought reduces
the size of its crop.  “Fundamentals, especially in the Center South region of
Brazil, with the perspective of smaller crop in 2011, are the
main factors to drive the market higher and higher every day,”
 Bruno Lima , a risk-management consultant at FCStone in Campinas,
Brazil, said in an e-mail.  Eight of 11 survey respondents said refined sugar on NYSE
Liffe in London will climb, and three forecast a drop. The price
gained 4 percent this week to $723.90 a metric ton.  Six of 11 respondents said refined sugar’s premium over raw
sweetener would widen and four said it would narrow. One
predicted little change.  In the attached chart, red bars are derived by subtracting
bearish forecasts from bullish estimates for raw sugar, with
readings above zero signaling that most respondents expect
higher prices. The green line shows raw-sugar prices, and the
blue line shows white sugar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
