Yuan forwards strengthened for the
first time in three days on speculation China’s increase in
interest rates will fuel inflows of capital and spur faster
appreciation in the currency.  The People’s Bank of China set the daily fixing rate 0.1
percent higher at 6.6695 from 6.6754 yesterday. A government
report today showed consumer prices climbed at the fastest pace
in 23 months in September, two days after the central bank
unexpectedly raised benchmark borrowing costs. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the currency against those of six major trading
partners, dropped yesterday by the most since July.  “International investors are speculating the yuan will
appreciate further as they expect more hot money will enter
China after the rate increase,” said  Huang Huawei , a foreign-
exchange trader at Shenzhen Development Bank Co. in Shenzhen.
“The move in the yuan forwards is also related to the dollar’s
overnight performance.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable contracts rose 0.32 percent to
6.4198 per dollar as of 4:21 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting bets
the currency will strengthen 3.5 percent in a year from the spot
rate. The Dollar  Index  traded on ICE futures in New York dropped
0.4 percent, adding to yesterday’s 1.3 percent loss.  The yuan gained 0.1 percent to 6.6430 in the spot market in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
It has strengthened 2.6 percent since a two-year peg against the
dollar was scrapped on June 19.  Inflation, Bonds  Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent last month, the statistics
bureau said at a briefing in Beijing, matching the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The  economy  expanded 9.6 percent
in the third quarter, the slowest pace in a year, compared with
10.3 percent in the previous three months, the government also
reported today.  The central bank on Oct. 19 raised the benchmark one-year
lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points, the first increase
since 2007.  The seven-day repurchase  rate  fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.93 percent, the lowest level since
Oct. 12, according to a daily fixing published at 11 a.m. by the
Interbank Funding Center.  Five-year swaps, the fixed rate needed to receive the
floating seven-day repo rate, dropped one basis point to 3.47
percent, having jumped to a six-month high of 3.48 percent
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the 3.29 percent note due September 2020
slipped two basis points to 3.68 percent in Shanghai, according
to data from the National Interbank Funding Center.  -- Belinda Cao . Editors:  Simon Harvey ,  Andrew Janes   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
