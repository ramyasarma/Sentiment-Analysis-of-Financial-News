BB&T Corp ., the second-largest North
Carolina bank, said third-quarter profit increased 39 percent on
gains from securities trading and fewer soured loans.  Net income rose to $210 million, or 30 cents a share, from
$152 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier, the Winston-Salem-
based lender said today in a statement. Earnings topped the 25-
cent average  estimate  of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Kelly King  is accelerating sales of
more than $1 billion of foreclosed real estate and loans that
aren’t accruing interest after waiting for prices to improve.
The move boosts BB&T’s writedowns of uncollectable loans as most
rival regional banks are reporting lower charge-offs.  “Loan growth in commercial and industrial lending,
automobile finance, revolving credit and our specialized lending
businesses has been exceptional,” King said in the statement.
“Our underlying businesses, in many ways are performing better
than ever.”  BB&T sold $451 million in loans and property during the
quarter and has more than $350 million in sales under contract,
King said in the statement. Loans considered uncollectable
increased 95 percent to $912 million from a year earlier.  Noninterest income increased 18 percent to $1.11 billion,
including $239 million in securities gains, the bank said.
Insurance income fell 0.8 percent to $252 million.  The lender reported $4.15 billion in loans not accruing
interest or foreclosed property, a 4.2 percent decrease from the
second quarter. The bank has $1.79 billion in restructured loans
that are still considered performing.  BB&T’s net interest margin, the spread between interest
paid on deposits and received on loans, increased to 4.09
percent from 3.68 percent a year earlier.  More Acquisitions  BB&T is the best-positioned bank in the mid-Atlantic region
to buy other banks as merger activity picks up next year, King
said on a conference call with analysts today. He cited the
bank’s revenue growth, which he said has led the industry over
the past two years.  “We will be very positive about having discussions over
the next 12 months,” he said.  Profit after the writedowns should be adequate to support
the bank’s quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share, King said at
a Sept. 14 investor conference. The lender stayed profitable
through the 2009 recession and was among the first banks to
repurchase its Troubled Asset Relief Program shares.  BB&T may boost its quarterly dividend late this year or in
early 2011, King said in April. He said rival banks cut their
payout to 1-cent a share, while BB&T’s dividend  yield  is 2.6
percent.  BB&T declined 1.3 percent to $22.62 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
