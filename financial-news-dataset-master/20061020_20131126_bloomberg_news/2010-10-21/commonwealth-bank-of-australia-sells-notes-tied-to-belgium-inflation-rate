Commonwealth Bank of Australia sold
40 million euros ($55.3 million) of 10-year notes that pay 1.6
times Belgium’s inflation rate.  The notes are fixed to the performance of the  Belgian
Consumer Price Health Index , an inflation measure that excludes
tobacco and some fuels. The inflation rate was 2.56 percent in
September, compared with a contraction of 0.08 percent at the
start of the year, the index shows.  The notes were privately placed through BNP Paribas Fortis
SA, which forecasts Belgium’s inflation index level of 113.29 to
rise by an average 1.9 percentage points next year, 1.6 points
in 2012 and 1.6 points in 2013.  The notes are backed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
which is rated AA by Standard & Poor’s, the third-highest
investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
