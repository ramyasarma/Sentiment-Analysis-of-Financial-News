Credit Suisse Group AG , the second-
biggest Swiss bank, reduced the amount it set aside to pay
investment-banking employees by 20 percent from a year earlier
as revenue at the unit slid 27 percent.  The investment bank’s nine-month compensation expense
dropped to 6.21 billion Swiss francs ($6.43 billion), or 49
percent of revenue, from 7.78 billion francs, or 44 percent, a
year earlier, the Zurich-based bank reported on its  website 
today. That’s enough to pay each of the unit’s 21,200 employees
292,924 francs for the period, down from 403,212 francs for each
of the 19,300 workers a year ago.  Investment banks typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year to pay workers, granting the bulk of the
awards in the form of year-end bonuses.  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and  Morgan Stanley  have all cut the
money they set aside by the end of September to pay bankers and
traders amid a business slowdown.  “The cuts in the pay and bonus pool are indicative of what
is happening to the rest of the industry in the third quarter,”
said  Shaun Springer , chief executive officer of Square Mile
Services Ltd., which advises London financial firms on pay.
“The easy money has gone and this is being reflected in pay.”  Goldman Sachs , which set a Wall Street profit record last
year, said earlier this week that it set aside $13.1 billion, or
43 percent of revenue, for compensation and benefits in the
first nine months of the year. That’s down 21 percent from a
year earlier, when it reserved 47 percent in the same period
before slashing compensation costs in the fourth quarter.  JPMorgan Chase  Last week, New York-based  JPMorgan Chase  said it allocated
39 percent of its investment bank’s revenue to pay workers in
the division for the first nine months of the year, up from 38
percent a year earlier.  The unit’s compensation expense fell 10 percent to $7.88
billion from $8.79 billion. That’s equal to $298,866 for each of
its 26,373 workers at the end of September, down from $353,834
on average for the division’s 24,828 employees a year earlier.  Goldman Sachs’s pool is enough to pay each of the New York-
based firm’s 35,400  employees  $370,706 for nine months’ work.
That’s down from an average $527,192 for the company’s 31,700
workers a year earlier.  Morgan Stanley , owner of the world’s largest brokerage, set
aside $12 billion for compensation and benefits in the nine-
month period, up 12 percent from a year earlier, as revenue
surged 43 percent, according to its website. Still, it cut the
investment bank’s bonus pool 8 percent this year as it reserved
more money to pay employees at the company’s expanded brokerage.  Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley’s firm-wide compensation is enough to pay
each of its 62,864 employees $190,681 for nine month’s work, up
from $175,543 for each of the 60,800 employees at the end of the
same period in 2009. The New York-based bank doesn’t report
headcounts for its three divisions.  Average pay per worker doesn’t reflect the amount of money
employees actually receive. Top executives and revenue producers
sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards, while clerical
staff get much smaller salaries.  The following compares compensation at Credit Suisse’s
investment bank with Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and
JPMorgan’s investment bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
