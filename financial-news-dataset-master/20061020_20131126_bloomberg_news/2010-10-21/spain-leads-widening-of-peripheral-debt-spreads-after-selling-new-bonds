Spanish 10-year bonds declined
relative to benchmark German bunds, pacing widening spreads for
so-called peripheral debt, after the country sold bonds maturing
in 2025 and 2032.  Spain’s 10-year yield increased six basis points to 4.13
percent, leaving the premium over bunds at 167 basis points,
from 162 basis points yesterday. Ireland’s 10-year securities
yielded 392 basis points more than the bund, up from 387 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
