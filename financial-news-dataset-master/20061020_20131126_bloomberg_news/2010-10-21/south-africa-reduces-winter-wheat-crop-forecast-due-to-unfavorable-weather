South Africa cut its forecast for
this season’s wheat crop by 4.1 percent because of
“unfavorable” weather in some regions.  Farmers may harvest 1.57 million metric tons of the grain,
Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the Crop Estimates Committee,
said by phone from Pretoria today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
