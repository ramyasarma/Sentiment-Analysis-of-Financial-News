Germany must begin to withdraw
financial support for the economic recovery now that growth is
on a sustainable basis, Deputy Finance Minister Hartmut Koschyk
said in a speech in Berlin.   “It’s now time to seek an end to the policy of debt-
financed economic support,” Koschyk said today.   The deputy minister also said that while a tax-revenue
report next month will show that earlier predictions of a
collapse in receipts were wrong, the government must not soften
its stance on budget consolidation.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
