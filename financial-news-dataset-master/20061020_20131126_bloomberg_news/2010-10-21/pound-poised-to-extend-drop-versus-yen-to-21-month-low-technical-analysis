The pound is trapped in a downtrend
against the yen and is poised to weaken to the lowest level
since January 2009, Gaitame.Com Research Institute Ltd. said,
citing trading patterns.  Sterling has been in a downward channel versus Japan’s
currency since August 2009, based on connecting the highs for
each month, said  Takuya Kawabata , a researcher at the unit of
Japan’s largest foreign-exchange margin company. It has fallen
more than 20 percent over the period, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The U.K. currency is also set to extend losses as
its appears to be repeating its decline from Aug. 3 to Sept. 14,
Kawabata said.  The pound traded at 127.87 yen as of 8:05 a.m. in Tokyo,
having started the year at 150.42. If it stays in the downtrend,
it is initially set to weaken to around 127 yen, approaching to
this year’s low of 126.77 touched on May 20, Kawabata said.  “Breaking that level would mean the currency’s downtrend
is gaining more momentum this time,” Tokyo-based Kawabata said
in an interview. “The pound may fall further.”  Should the currency make a clear break below 127 yen, it
may extend its slide toward 124.94 yen, he said, basing his
target on the pound replicating its decline that ended Sept. 14.
That would put it at the lowest since Jan. 27, 2009.  The currency dropped by about 10 yen from Aug. 3 to Sept.
14. Falling to 124.94 yen would mean it dropped by the same
amount from its high of 135.06 on Sept. 17, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
