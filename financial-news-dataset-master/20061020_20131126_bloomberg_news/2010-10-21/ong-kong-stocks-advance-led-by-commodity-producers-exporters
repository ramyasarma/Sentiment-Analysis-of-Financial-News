Hong Kong  stocks  rose, as insurers
extended their gains, and as commodity producers climbed on
higher oil and metal prices.  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., China’s No. 2 insurer,
gained 3 percent, rising for a third day after China
unexpectedly increased its lending and deposit rates on Oct. 19.
Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil producer, climbed 1
percent.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. , the largest real-estate
company in the southern Chinese city, fell 3 percent on concern
China may take more steps to contain inflation after prices
accelerated to the fastest pace in 23 months.  The  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.4 percent to 23,649.48 at the
close, with five stocks rising for every four that fell on the
45-member gauge. The gauge fell as much as 0.5 percent today,
and is set for its first weekly drop since the period ended Aug.
27. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies rose 1.2 percent to 13,615.41.  “Insurers hold 90 percent of their investment in
government bonds,” said  Francis Lun , general manager at
Fulbright Securities Ltd. “A quarter percent rate hike will
increase their income substantially.” China’s central bank
raised one-year lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points on
Oct. 19.  Ping An jumped 3 percent to HK$88.15, the second-biggest
gain on the Hang Seng Index.  China Life Insurance Co.  climbed
1.3 percent to HK$36.45. The two largest life insurers in China
extended yesterday’s gains after Mirae Asset Securities Co. said
life insurers will outperform in a rising interest-rate
environment.  Surprise Rate Rise  China’s central bank raised borrowing costs on Oct. 19 for
the first time since 2007, as policy makers try to curb lending
and prevent an asset-price bubble.  Cnooc rose 1 percent to HK$16.08, and  PetroChina Co. , the
country’s biggest oil company, increased 0.4 percent to HK$9.83.  Crude oil for November delivery rose 2.9 percent to settle
at $81.77 a barrel yesterday in New York as the dollar resumed a
slide, enhancing the appeal of commodities as alternative
investments. The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals
including aluminum and copper advanced 1.2 percent.  Jiangxi Copper Co. , China’s No. 1 producer of the metal,
gained 1.8 percent to HK$22.60, while Zhaojin Mining Industry
Co., a miner based in China’s Shandong province, climbed 1.5
percent to HK$24.25. Aluminum Corp. of China increased 0.4
percent to HK$7.93.  The Hang Seng Index has climbed 8.1 percent this  year , as
economic data from China and the U.S. helped ease concern global
growth will slow from Chinese efforts to cool property prices
and Europe’s debt crisis. Shares on the index trade at an
average of 15.1 times  estimated earnings , compared with 12.5
times for the year’s low on May 25.  ‘Developers Suffer Most’  A measure of property stocks had the biggest decline among
the Hang Seng Index’s four  industry groups . Guangzhou R&F
Properties dropped 3 percent to HK$11.18, and Shimao Property
Holdings Ltd., which receives all its sales from China,
retreated 1.6 percent to HK$12.70.  China’s consumer prices rose 3.6 percent last month, the
statistics bureau said at a briefing in Beijing, the fastest
pace in 23 months. China’s economy grew 9.6 percent in the third
quarter, it also said, the smallest gain in a year.  “Inflation is getting out of control,” said Fulbright’s
Lun. “China may need to raise the interest rate again before
the end of this year,” increasing the burden on mortgagees.
“Property developers suffer the most.”  China Mobile  dropped 1.5 percent to HK$81, the biggest drag
on the Hang Seng Index, after posting third-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates. Net income increased 3.5 percent to
29.6 billion yuan ($4.5 billion) from 28.6 billion yuan a year
earlier, according to figures derived from nine-month earnings
reported by the Beijing-based company today. Profit was expected
to be 30 billion yuan, according to the average of eight analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.5 percent to 23,668.  To contact the reporter on this story:
