Eaga Plc , which runs the U.K. state-
funded Warm Front heating insulation program, fell to its lowest
since June 2007 in London trading after the U.K. government cut
the initiative to help reduce the public budget deficit.  Eaga fell as much as 22 percent to 65 pence and traded at
67.25 pence, down 19 percent, at 10 a.m. local time. That
followed a 25 percent plunge yesterday and reduced the market
value of the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England-based company to about
170 million pounds ($269 million).  The U.K. Treasury said yesterday that the Warm Front
program will be phased out “over time,” saving the government
345 million pounds by the 2013-2014 tax year. The current
program has been allocated 959 million pounds for the three tax
years ending in April 2011, according to the National Audit
Office, which monitors government spending.  “Warm Front was Eaga’s largest contract, previously
accounting for 50 percent of revenues,”  Arabella Llewellyn , an
analyst with Canaccrod Genuity Ltd, wrote in a note today.  Llewellyn said she will reduce the stock’s adjusted diluted
earnings per share forecast for the year ending May 2012 by 30
percent to 11.1 pence and for the full year ending May 2013 to
12.3 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
