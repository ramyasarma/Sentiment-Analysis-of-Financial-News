The Hong Kong International Airport
has stockpiled blankets, 7,000 bottles of distilled water and
food including cookies and milk powder for passengers who may be
trapped by Typhoon Megi, the Standard reported.  The airport has set up an emergency center with seven
officers on standby to liaise with the Hong Kong Observatory and
airlines about the storm, the Hong Kong-based English-language
newspaper reported today.  There are also 60 officers in four “passenger care” teams
that will work in shifts to deal with flight disruptions, the
newspaper said, citing Ng Chi-kee, the deputy director of
operations for Hong Kong’s Airport Authority.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
