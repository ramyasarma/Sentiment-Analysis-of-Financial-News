SanDisk Corp. , the world’s biggest
maker of flash-memory cards, jumped 5.3 percent in extended
trading after third-quarter profit topped analysts’ estimates.  Excluding some expenses, earnings rose to $1.30 a share,
from 75 cents a year earlier, the Milpitas, California-based
company said today in a statement. Analysts had projected $1.05
on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  SanDisk increased profits by shifting production to a more
efficient manufacturing technology, Chief Financial Officer  Judy Bruner  said on a conference call. Demand from makers of phones
and tablet computers is strong, helping offset relatively weaker
demand for flash-memory cards in Europe and the U.S., she said.  Fourth-quarter sales will range from $1.25 billion to $1.33
billion, the company said. That compared with an average analyst
estimate of $1.29 billion.  SanDisk  rose  $1.98 to $39.10 in late trading after the
report. The shares have climbed 28 percent this year on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.  SanDisk sells removable flash-memory cards and supplies
memory chips to Apple Inc., whose iPad, iPhone and iPod all use
so-called Nand flash as their main storage for music and data.
 Apple ’s new MacBook Air laptop, introduced this week, also uses
flash memory in lieu of a traditional hard-disk drive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
