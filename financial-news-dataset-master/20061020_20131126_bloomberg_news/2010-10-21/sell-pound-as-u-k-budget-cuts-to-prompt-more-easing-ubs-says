Investors should sell the pound as
the U.K.’s deepest budget cuts since World War II will likely
prompt the Bank of England to step up bond purchases to support
the economy,  UBS AG  said.  “The risk of renewed quantitative easing makes sterling a
sell,”  Mansoor Mohi-uddin , head of global currency strategy at
UBS in Singapore, wrote to clients today. “As Britain continues
to run a large trade imbalance, monetary policy may have to be
loosened again sharply to support the economy.”  The pound is expected to underperform against the euro,
Swiss franc, Australian dollar and Norwegian krone, Mohi-uddin
said. Against the dollar, the U.K currency “is set to struggle
around $1.60.”  Sterling today fell against all 16 of its most traded
peers. It depreciated as much as 1.1 percent against the euro to
the weakest level in more than six months, surpassing 89 pence
for the first time since April 1. It was 0.5 percent lower at
$1.5765 at 12:32 p.m. in London.  The U.K. currency also dropped 0.6 percent to the weakest
level since March 1985 versus the Australian dollar, reaching
A$1.5952. It depreciated 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc to
1.5159.  The pound has declined 6.1 percent this year against a
basket of its developed-country peers, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, making it the worst
performing currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
