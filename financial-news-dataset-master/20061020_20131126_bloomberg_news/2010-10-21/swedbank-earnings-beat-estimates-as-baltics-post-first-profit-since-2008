Swedbank AB  rose to the highest
price in more than two years in Stockholm trading after the
largest bank in the Baltic countries reported better-than-
estimated earnings, helped by a profit rebound in the region.  Swedbank gained as much as 6.15 kronor, or 6.6 percent, to
99.50 kronor, the highest intraday price since September 2008,
and traded at 98.15 kronor as of 9:22 a.m. local time. The stock
has rallied 38 percent this year, making it the fourth-best
performer among 54 companies in the  Bloomberg Europe Banks  and
Financial Services Index.  Net income in the third quarter was 2.59 billion kronor
($389 million), compared with a net loss of 3.34 billion kronor
in the year-earlier period, the Stockholm-based bank said in a
 statement  today. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 1.52 billion kronor.  “The main driver was loan losses as Swedbank recorded
reversals in Sweden, Russia and the Ukraine,” said  Maths Liljedahl , an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Stockholm. “We were
aware that reversals eventually would occur, but we were not
expecting them already this quarter.” Loan losses of 327
million kronor in the Baltic countries were lower than the
analyst’s estimated 938 million kronor, he said.  The credit impairments in the region, which stemmed almost
entirely from Latvia, narrowed from 3.33 billion kronor in the
year-earlier period. Profit at the unit in Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania totaled 531 million kronor, compared with a loss of
2.32 billion kronor a year ago.  Baltic Profits  The lender’s total loan impairments dropped to 120 million
kronor from 6.12 billion kronor after it recouped money set
aside for bad loans in Sweden, Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania.  Swedbank was the only Swedish lender to have a full-year
net loss in 2009 as the Baltic region suffered the steepest
recession in the European Union, pushing up loan impairments.
The bank was profitable in Estonia and Lithuania in the third
quarter, while it reported a loss for Latvia.  “We are very pleased with the fact that Baltic banking
reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of 2008,”
Swedbank Chief Executive Officer  Michael Wolf  said on a
conference call with journalists today. Provided the economy
develops in line with expectations, the bank’s group profit “is
expected to continue to improve,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
