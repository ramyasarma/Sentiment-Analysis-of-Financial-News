Copper rose for a second straight
day after a report showed economic growth in China, the world’s
largest user of the metal, topped economists’ estimates.  China expanded by 9.6 percent in the third quarter, above
the median 9.5 percent estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Gains in the Asian nation’s metal use will be
“robust,” according to Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-
largest mining company. Before today, copper prices jumped 13
percent in New York this year.  Chinese metals “consumption is fairly strong,” said
 Michael Jansen , an analyst at JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in
London.  Copper futures for December delivery rose 4.7 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.8405 a pound at 9:56 a.m. on the Comex in New
York.  Chinese construction of cities, homes and factories will
support metals demand even as economic expansion slows, Ian
Bauert, Rio Tinto’s China managing director, said in an
interview today in Shanghai.  Global copper demand probably will outpace supply by
180,000 metric tons this year, with the deficit widening to
482,000 tons next year, JPMorgan’s Jansen said.  “The Chinese demand stories are still out there,” said
Frank Lesh, a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago. “China’s
economy is still expanding, and China’s the big mover on copper
right now.”  Supply Shortfall  Copper  stockpiles  monitored daily by the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.2 percent to 370,000 tons, down 26 percent this
year, data show. Orders to draw copper from LME inventories, or
canceled warrants, rose 12 percent to 28,475 tons, the highest
level since Sept. 22, for a two-day jump of 28 percent.  In London, copper for delivery in three months rose $96.50,
or 1.2 percent, to $8,436.50 ($3.83 a pound) a ton. Aluminum,
lead, tin and zinc also gained. Nickel fell.  To contact the reporters on the story:
