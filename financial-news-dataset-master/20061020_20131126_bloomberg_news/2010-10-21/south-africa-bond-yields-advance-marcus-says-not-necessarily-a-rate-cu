South Africa’s benchmark bond fell
for a third day, raising the yield to the highest in more than a
week, after the Financial Mail quoted central bank Governor Gill
Marcus as saying there may “not necesasarily” be an interest-
rate cut at the next monetary policy committee meeting in
November.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 retreated 21
cents to 125.47 rand by 9:35 a.m. in Johannesburg. The yield
increased four basis points to 7.22 percent, the highest since
Oct. 12.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
