Philip Morris International Inc. ,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, reported a
1.3 percent increase in third-quarter profit, missing some
analysts’ estimates, after raising cigarette prices.  Net income advanced to $1.82 billion, or 99 cents a share,
from $1.8 billion, or 93 cents, a year earlier, the New York-
based maker of Marlboro cigarettes said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, profit was $1 a share. Analysts projected
$1.01, the average of 11  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  Philip Morris, led by Chief Executive Officer  Louis Camilleri , raised prices in Europe and Australia, helping
counter falling shipments in Japan that slowed sales growth.
Revenue excluding excise taxes totaled $6.61 billion, trailing
the average analysts’ estimate of $6.98 billion.  “Pricing around the world is good,”  Thomas Russo , who
oversees more than $3 billion at Gardner Russo & Gardner in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said today by telephone. “It’s offset
by the fact that some of Philip Morris’s markets are
economically weak.” He managed 7.4 million Philip Morris shares
as of June 30.  Separately,  Reynolds American Inc. , the second-largest U.S.
tobacco company, posted third-quarter earnings that topped
estimates by 1 cent on a per-share basis. Net income rose 5.2
percent, Reynolds American said today.  Philip Morris rose 8 cents to $57.56 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have climbed 19
percent this year. Reynolds American gained 5 cents to $63.05.  Cigarette Shipments  At Philip Morris, cigarette  shipments  fell 2.9 percent
excluding acquisitions, with Europe declining 4.6 percent.
Spending cuts and higher taxes aimed at slashing budget deficits
in countries such as Greece have sapped demand for tobacco.
Lower shipments in Japan resulted from an increase in second-
quarter orders ahead of an Oct. 1 price increase.  Philip Morris increased its full-year profit forecast
because of favorable currencies, improving business and a lower
tax rate. It expects to earn $3.90 a share to $3.95 a share,
higher than its July projection of $3.75 to $3.85. Analysts
predicted $3.82. Earnings were $3.24 on that basis in 2009.  The company, which generates all of its sales from outside
the U.S., was spun off from  Altria Group Inc.  in 2008. Altria,
the largest U.S. tobacco company, reported yesterday a 28
percent increase in third-quarter net income that beat analysts’
estimates, helped by higher prices for Marlboro cigarettes in
the U.S. and snuff sales.  Reynolds American’s third-quarter profit rose to $381
million, or $1.30 a share, from $362 million, or $1.24, a year
earlier. Excluding some items, earnings were $1.35 a share.  The Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based maker of Camel
cigarettes raised the low end of its full-year profit forecast
by 5 cents. It expects to earn $4.95 to $5.05, compared with an
average analysts’ estimate of $5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
