William Hill Plc , the U.K.’s leading
bookmaker with more than 2,300 shops, said third-quarter revenue
rose 22 percent and operating profit for the full-year should be
near the top end of analysts forecasts.  Retail net revenue advanced 16 percent driven by the soccer
World Cup. Online net sales rose 35 percent helped by Sportsbook
which posted 23 million pounds ($36.2 million) of revenue in the
third-quarter, a 287 percent increase on the year earlier
period, the London-based bookmaker said today in a statement
distributed by the Regulatory News Service.  “The group performed strongly in the quarter, even taking
into account the weak prior year comparatives,” Chief Executive
Officer  Ralph Topping  said in the statement. “While a number of
macro-economic factors leave us cautious in our expectations for
2011, the group is very well placed through the final quarter of
2010.”  The U.K. government’s spending cuts, announced yesterday,
and a planned increase in Value Added Tax means that William
Hill “remains cautious” in its outlook for 2011, the company
said today.  William Hill rose as much as 9.1 pence, or 5.6 percent, in
London trading to 170.8 pence. It traded at 168 pence as of 8:55
a.m. The stock has lost 9.5 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 1.18 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
