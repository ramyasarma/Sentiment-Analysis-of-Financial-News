Argentina’s soybean crop, the third
largest in the world, is being planted at a quicker pace than a
year earlier as farmers take advantage of rains in September and
October to sow before the Southern Hemisphere summer begins.  About 4.6 percent of the 2010 to 2011 soybean crop,
forecast to cover 18.7 million hectares, is planted to date,
compared with the 0.2 percent of the forecast area that was sown
in the same period a year earlier, the Buenos Aires Cereals
Exchange said today in an e-mailed report.  The December through February summer months are forecast to
be drier than average as a consequence of La Nina, a weather
pattern which reduces rainfall. The threat of drought is driving
farmers to accelerate planting of soy and corn to take advantage
of current soil moisture after recent rains, the exchange said.  Argentina is the third largest exporter of soybeans after
the U.S. and Brazil. Farmers grew a record crop of about 55
million tons in the 2009 to 2010 season as the country saw above
average rains produced by El Nino, a weather pattern which forms
in the Pacific Ocean and affects climate worldwide.  Argentina’s 2010 to 2011 corn crop, which is forecast to
cover 3 million hectares, is 62 percent planted, the exchange
said today. The crop is expected to reach a record 26 million
tons, according to the agricultural ministry. Argentina is the
second largest exporter of corn, behind the U.S.  The Argentine wheat crop, which is already fully planted,
is expected to be about 12.1 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
