New Zealand may review tax
incentives for the film industry to help retain the production
of The Hobbit, the New Zealand Herald reported, citing comments
from Finance Minister Bill English.  The government is taking an interest in the issue and will
collectively make a decision about it, English said, according
to the newspaper. Warner Bros Productions Ltd. may be using the
industrial dispute over the making of the two movies to push an
agenda for tax breaks, he said, according to the Herald.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
