Kenya plans to start drilling for
geothermal steam deposits at Menengai near the southwestern town
of Nakuru in December, said Silas Simiyu, chief executive
officer of the state-run Geothermal Development Co.  By June 2011, the East African country plans to drill six
wells in the area, using two drilling rigs, Simiyu said at a
conference today in Nairobi, the capital. By December 2011,
Kenya plans to seek as many as four geothermal power-plant
developers to exploit deposits in Menengai, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
