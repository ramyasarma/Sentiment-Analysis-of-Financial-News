China’s central bank will sell 50
billion yuan ($7.5 billion) of three-month bills at a  yield  of
1.7 percent today after keeping rates unchanged since June 10,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The forecast showed investors expect an increase of 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, from the 1.5704 percent
at the last 14 consecutive open-market auctions. The People’s
Bank of China raised one-year benchmark lending and deposit
rates on Oct. 19, the first time since 2007.  The highest forecast was 1.8 percent, and the lowest 1.6
percent, the survey of 13 finance companies showed.  The offering  amount  is the largest since July 22.  -- Belinda Cao . Editor:  Sandy Hendry   To contact the Bloomberg news staff on this story: Belinda Cao
