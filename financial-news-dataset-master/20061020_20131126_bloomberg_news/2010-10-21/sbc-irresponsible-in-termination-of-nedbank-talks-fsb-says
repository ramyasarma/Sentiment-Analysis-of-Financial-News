HSBC Holdings Plc ’s manner of ending
talks to buy a controlling stake in  Nedbank Group Ltd.  was
“irresponsible,” according to South Africa’s financial
regulator.  “HSBC was irresponsible” in how it terminated the
discussions, which “caused extensive speculation with regard to
the affairs of Nedbank,” Bert Chanetsa, deputy executive
officer at the Pretoria-based  Financial Services Board , said in
an e-mailed statement today. “This is likely to result in a
further negative impact on the share price.”  A spokesman for HSBC in London declined to comment when
reached by Bloomberg.  HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, sought to acquire Nedbank,
South Africa’s fourth-biggest lender, to help it expand in
emerging markets and profit from trade flows in Africa. The
London-based company abandoned its bid on Oct. 15 without giving
a reason and less than three weeks after replacing Chief
Executive Officer  Michael Geoghegan  and Chairman  Stephen Green .  “HSBC’s conduct in the circumstances is to be regretted,”
Chanetsa said. “Such conduct is not considered to be in
accordance with the spirit of responsible and fair utilization
of the South African financial markets.”  Nedbank , which is controlled by Old Mutual Plc, fell 6.1
percent to 137.8 rand on the day HSBC ended talks. It slid 17
cents, or 0.1 percent, to 136.91 rand as of 4:21 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading today. HSBC rose 13.7 pence, or 2.1
percent, to 673.7 pence as of 3:22 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
