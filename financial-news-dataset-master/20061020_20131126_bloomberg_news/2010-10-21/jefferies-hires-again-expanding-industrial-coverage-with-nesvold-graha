Jefferies Group Inc. , a New York-
based securities firm that is expanding investment banking,
trading and securities research, added two stock analysts to
cover industrial companies.  H.  Peter Nesvold , 39, recently at Lazard Asset Management
LLC and formerly at Bear Stearns Cos., will lead a team covering
automotive and transportation companies and R.  Scott Graham , 48,
formerly of Boenning & Scattergood Inc., will cover diversified
industrials, according to  Steven R. Black , global head of equity
research at Jefferies.  The company has increased staff by 30 percent in 20 months
to 2,971 in a drive to profit from a recovery in the financial
services industry. The new hires bring to 12 the number of
analysts covering industrial companies.  Jefferies wants to recruit analysts in Europe and Asia to
cover industrial companies, Black said. “Our strategy is to go
deep and broad into a sector with coverage across a broad range
of market capitalizations,” he said today in a telephone
interview.  In August, Jefferies said it had added investment bankers
 Robert A. Arrieta , formerly of  JPMorgan Chase & Co ., and  Robert A. Bayer Jr ., formerly of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to its
global industrials group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
