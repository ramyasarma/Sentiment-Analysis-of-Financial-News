Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  offered to
exchange 1.6 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of subordinated debt
for new bonds at a rate of 20 cents on the euro as the
nationalized lender seeks to generate capital.  Anglo Irish will offer bondholders that don’t take up the
exchange 1 cent per 1,000-euro face amount to redeem their
floating-rate lower Tier 2 notes due 2014, 2016 and 2017, the
Dublin-based lender said in a statement today. The new
securities will be due 2011 and guaranteed by the government.  “The government is clearly trying to get as high a
participation rate in the exchange as possible,” said  Fergal O’Leary , a director at Dublin-based Glas Securities, which
specializes in fixed income markets. “The alternative to taking
part is quite penal.”  Ireland faces a bill of more than 50 billion euros, about
22 percent of 2009 gross domestic product, to prop up lenders
and wants to ensure the burden is shared with subordinated
bondholders. The exchange offer comes after Finance Minister
 Brian Lenihan  vowed to “address the issue” of junior
bondholders taking a loss on their investments in nationalized
banks.  Anglo Irish Bank was nationalized in January after borrowing
from mostly international investors and lending to property
developers who couldn’t repay loans when the propert market
crashed. Commercial real estate prices in Ireland have fallen
about 60 percent since peaking in 2007.  ‘Nullify Holdouts’  The lower Tier 2 notes were trading at 20 to 22 cents in
the euro after the offer was announced, said  Tom Jenkins , an
analyst at Jefferies International Ltd. in London.  Holders of the equivalent of about 370 million euros of
Anglo Irish’s more-junior securities in euros and pounds will
get a 50-euro or 50-pound consent fee to give the issuer the
right to buy the notes back at 1 cent or 1 penny for each 1,000
euros or 1,000 pounds ($1,576) of securities, according to a
separate statement.  “Both offers have been structured to try to nullify
holdouts,” Jenkins said. “I really can’t see them amending the
exchange price, but I guess there’s always a chance.”  Repurchasing a liability such as a bond at a discount to
face value generates a capital gain that the purchaser can use
to bolster its capital.  The Irish government pledged as much as 11.4 billion euros
to support Anglo Irish on Sept. 30, on top of the 22.9 billion
euros it has already pumped in since seizing the lender in
January 2009. Its base-case calculation of the cost of the
rescue, which involves keeping part of the lender alive while
putting the remainder into runoff, is 29 billion euros.  The Anglo Irish rescue package will cost every man, woman
and child in Ireland as much as 7,500 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
