Caterpillar Inc. , the world’s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, raised its
full-year earnings forecast and posted third-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates. The shares fell after it said tax,
pension and research costs will rise in 2011.  Profit for 2010 will be $3.80 to $4 a share, up from a July
forecast of $3.15 to $3.85, Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar
said today in a statement. The average of 23 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was for $3.76 a share. Third-quarter net
income of $1.22 a share beat the $1.09 average of 21 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Doug Oberhelman , 57, has announced
plans in the past five months to build factories in Brazil and
China, where economic growth is outpacing the U.S. Caterpillar
is also selling more excavators and haul-trucks to mining
companies as commodities prices increase. Oberhelman succeeded
 Jim Owens  on July 1 as CEO.  “It’s truly a story of emerging markets,”  Brian Rayle , a
Cleveland-based analyst at Northcoast Research who has a
“neutral” rating on the shares, said in an interview. “Demand
looks like it’s better in this year and 2011.”  Caterpillar  fell $1.50 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $78.38 at
11:45 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares earlier fell as much as 2.2 percent.  Caterpillar said it expects some “cost headwinds” in 2011
as the tax rate increases. It also forecast higher expenses for
pension and retiree medical benefits and research and
development related to emissions.  2011 Forecast  “Some investors may have underestimated the impact” of
the costs,  Joel Levington , a managing director of corporate
credit at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York,
said in an e-mail.  Third-quarter  net income  almost doubled to $792 million, or
$1.22 a share, from $404 million, or 64 cents, a year earlier.
Sales rose 53 percent to $11.1 billion from $7.3 billion.  Revenue in 2010 will be $41 billion to $42 billion, up from
a previous outlook of $39 billion to $42 billion. Sales will be
“approaching” $50 billion in 2011, the company said.  Sales from Caterpillar’s  machines  business, which makes
excavators, bulldozers, haul trucks and loaders, rose 84 percent
to $7.2 billion in the quarter. Engine sales climbed 21 percent
to $3.25 billion while financial-product revenue fell 5 percent
to $682 million.  Jobs Added  “The numbers are better across the board, in machinery and
engines,”  Eli Lustgarten , an analyst for Longbow Research in
Independence, Ohio, who has a “neutral” rating on the shares,
said in an interview. “It’s a solid beat.”  Global  employment  was 102,336 at the end of the quarter,
including about 2,300 full-time workers, following the
acquisition of Electro-Motive Diesel. The company added 6,200
full-time employees this year, primarily because of production
increases, and about 9,000 part-time, agency and temporary
workers.  Caterpillar cut about 19,000 full-time jobs and 18,000
part-time and temporary workers from late 2008 through the end
of last year after demand plunged during the recession.  The company today forecast world economic growth in 2010
and next year will be more than 3.5 percent. The U.S. may expand
2.5 percent in this by year and 3 percent next year while
developing countries may grow about 7 percent in 2010 and 6.5
percent in 2011, the company said. Growth in China may moderate
in 2011 to about 9.5 percent from 10.5 percent, it said.  Caterpillar said it expects the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
will increase liquidity in the fourth quarter and the European
Central Bank will hold its current policy through the yearend
even though turmoil in government debt markets could result in
additional bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
