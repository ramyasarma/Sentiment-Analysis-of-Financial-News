Travelers Cos. , the insurer added to
the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2009, lifted its full-year
forecast after third-quarter profit rose as sales increased and
investment gains climbed.  Net income advanced to $1.01 billion, or $2.11 per share,
from $935 million, or $1.65, the same period last year, the
insurer said in a statement today. Operating profit, which
excludes some investment results, was $1.81 a share, beating the
$1.47 average  estimate  of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Full-
year operating profit will be $5.75 to $5.95 a share, compared
with the previous  forecast  of $5.20 to $5.45, the insurer said.  Industrywide, sales increased for the first time in 13
quarters in the period ended June 30, as carriers including
 Allstate Corp.  raised rates for homeowners to counter the
slowdown in demand that began in 2007, according to the Property
Casualty Insurers  Association  of America. Commercial sales may
have increased in the period ended Sept. 30, the Council of
Insurance Agents and Brokers said yesterday.  “A slight up-tick in demand for insurance in the third
quarter” benefited the industry, the Council said in a
 statement . The change may have been “a result of a slowly
growing economy or buyers taking advantage of low pricing.”  Travelers climbed 34 cents, or 0.6 percent to $54.98 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
gained 10 percent this year, compared with the 6.9 percent rise
in the  30-company Dow .  Underwriting Profit  Travelers earned 9.4 cents of underwriting profit per each
premium dollar in the third quarter, compared with 10.3 cents in
the year-earlier period. Policy sales climbed 2.3 percent to
$5.46 billion for the New York-based insurer.  Travelers had a $147 million gain by withdrawing funds from
reserves after determining it had more money set aside than
needed for claims on policies sold in prior quarters. That
compares with $202 million in the same period in 2009. Results
included a $45 million benefit from a court ruling in August in
a reinsurance dispute with  Munich Re  over asbestos.  Travelers’s book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose 6.2 percent to $59.11 per share from $55.67 at
the end of June as bonds gained in value and the company
repurchased stock.  Verisk Gain  Realized investment gains climbed to $147 million after
tax, from $21 million a year earlier as Travelers booked a gain
of $133 million tied to the sale of shares in  Verisk Analytics
Inc.  Verisk, the supplier of actuarial data, raised more than $2
billion in an  initial public offering  in 2009 and more than $500
million in a share sale in September. Travelers recorded a $103
million benefit last year from the sale of half its stake in the
Jersey City, New Jersey-based company.  Net investment income, mostly from bonds, dropped 3.1
percent to $597 million as interest rates declined. Reinvesting
maturing bonds at current yields could trim investment income by
$49 million next year and $108 million in 2012, the company said
in a  presentation  on its website.  “Earnings estimates going forward may not go up and may go
down because of the big drop in interest rates,” said  Brian Meredith , an analyst with UBS AG. “Their investment yields on
their fixed income portfolios are going to be dropping.”  Chief Executive Officer  Jay Fishman  put most of the
company’s fixed-income investments in municipal bonds,
sidestepping the losses from mortgage-backed securities that
hobbled competitors such as  American International Group Inc. 
Travelers held more than $40 billion of municipal debt at the
end of June.  Municipal Bonds, Hurricanes  State and local government bonds returned 3.7 percent in
the three months ended Sept. 30, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s Municipal Master Index.  Travelers has been adding sales of home and auto coverage
to individuals after some business clients scaled back. Sales of
so called personal-lines coverage through agents advanced 7.2
percent to $1.98 billion.  “We are optimistic that we will be able to continue to
grow our personal insurance business,” Fishman said in the
statement.  Catastrophes cost the firm $117 million before taxes in the
three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $158 million in the
year-earlier period, as the U.S. has escaped a direct hit from
storms in the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
