Italian prosecutors probing alleged
money-laundering at the Vatican Bank suspect some clergymen may
have posed as account holders at the lender for wealthy
individuals, Corriere della Sera said, citing court documents.  A Rome judge yesterday upheld the seizure of 23 million
euros ($32 million) in an Italian bank account registered to the
Institute for Religious Works, as the Vatican bank is called,
and three other operations are under scrutiny for alleged money-
laundering violations, the newspaper said.  In one case a priest allegedly moved 300,000 euros from an
account in San Marino and transferred it to a businessman,
Corriere reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Lorenzo Totaro  in Rome
