Iggy’s, a modern European eatery in
Singapore, was named Asia’s finest restaurant last night.  Chef Ignatius Chan reclaimed the top spot in “The Miele
Guide” from L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Hong Kong, which fell
to second. French chef Joel Robuchon held on to third place with
Robuchon a Galera, in Macau. Jaan, Singapore, again came fourth.  The guide was founded in 2008 after the San Pellegrino
 World’s 50 Best Restaurants  awards failed to recognize Asian
establishments. Miele’s Top 20 selection has ended up heavily
weighted to European cuisine, with Western groups such as Nobu
and Zuma among the leading Asian eateries.  “We feel we have contributed toward bringing to the
world’s attention just how amazing and incredible some of the
restaurants, restaurateurs and chefs in Asia truly are,” Tan
Su-Lyn, director of Ate Media, which publishes the guide, said
today in an e-mailed news release.  Among the big gainers this year are Antonio’s, a fusion
restaurant in Cavite, the Philippines; Zuma, in Hong Kong; and
Cilantro Restaurant and Wine Bar, a French-Japanese eatery in
Kuala Lumpur. The only entry in Japan is L’Atelier de Joel
Robuchon, in Tokyo.  The winners are picked by a panel of chefs, restaurateurs
and food writers. The winners were announced at a dinner in the
Grand Hyatt Macau. It was the first time the award ceremony has
been held outside Singapore.  ( Richard Vines  is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
