German stocks advanced to the
highest level since June 2008 after a report showed the
country’s manufacturing and service industries climbed more than
economists had forecast in October and the country raised its
growth forecast.  Volkswagen AG  surged 3.6 percent as Europe’s largest
carmaker moved forward a sales goal. MAN SE rose 3.2 as Fiat SpA
raised its yearly forecasts.  Rhoen-Klinikum  AG added 1.9 percent
as  HSBC Holdings Plc  recommended the shares.  TUI AG  fell 2.7
percent after its  TUI Travel Plc  unit restated figures for the
2009 fiscal year and agreed to the departure of Chief Financial
Officer Paul Bowtell.  The benchmark DAX Index rose 1.3 percent to 6,611.01 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, extending yesterday’s 0.5 percent
rise. The measure has rallied 6.1 percent this month amid
speculation policy makers at the U.S. Federal Reserve will
announce another round of asset purchases at their November
meeting in a bid to jumpstart economic growth. The broader  HDAX
Index  also gained 1.3 percent today.  “The PMI data show we are on the right track right now and
Germany has momentum for further growth,” said  Andreas Lipkow ,
an equity trader at  MWB Fairtrade Wertpapierhandelsbank AG  in
Frankfurt. “Germany has a special position in Europe and German
corporates are in pretty good shape. We will have a good
earnings quarter.”  An index measuring growth in manufacturing rose to 56.1
from 55.1, while the services industry gauge increased to 56.6
from 54.9. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  German Economy  The German government raised its forecast for economic
growth to 3.4 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2011, Economy
Minister  Rainer Bruederle  said in Berlin today. The government
previously forecast expansion of 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent,
respectively.  European manufacturing unexpectedly grew this month, Markit
Economics said today. China’s economy expanded 9.6 percent in
the third quarter, increasing pressure on the country to let the
yuan gain as Group of 20 officials prepared to meet in Seoul
tomorrow to discuss currencies.  U.S. initial jobless claims fell last week by 23,000 to
452,000, a level that’s consistent with little improvement in
the labor market, Labor Department figures showed today. The
Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next three to
six months probably rose 0.3 percent, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed before a report due at 10 a.m.
in New York.  Of the 35 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have announced
results since Oct. 7, 26 have beaten analyst estimates for per-
share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the
U.S., 97 of the 113 S&P 500 companies that have announced
results this earnings season have topped predictions, the data
show.  VW, MAN  Volkswagen preferred shares gained 3.6 percent to 93.78
euros, the highest close in more than two years. The carmaker is
bringing forward its goal to exceed 10 million unit sales by
three years to 2015, Manager Magazin reported, citing internal
planning.  Volkswagen  is aiming for 10.2 million unit sales five years
from now, including sales from  Porsche SE , MAN SE and  Scania AB ,
the magazine said. VW originally intended to pass the 10
million-mark in 2018, it said.  MAN SE, Europe’s third-largest truckmaker, climbed 3.2
percent to 83.72 euros. Fiat raised its 2010 forecasts after
quarterly profit beat analysts’ estimates on sales of Iveco
trucks and Case New Holland tractors.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Europe’s second-biggest airline,
gained 1.7 percent to 15.13 euros, the first advance in three
days.  Deutsche Post AG , Europe’s biggest mail carrier, increased
1.3 percent to 13.58 euros.  Rhoen-Klinikum, Wirecard  Rhoen-Klinikum rose 1.9 percent to 17.50 euros as HSBC
initiated coverage of the operator of rehabilitation and
emergency health care facilities with an “overweight” rating.  Wirecard AG , a maker of electronic payment and risk
management software, surged 8.9 percent to 10.82 euros, the
highest close since May 2008.  EBay  Inc., owner of the second-
most visited e-commerce site, forecast fourth-quarter sales and
earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  TUI AG tumbled 2.7 percent to 8.64 euros, dropping for a
third day. Earnings per share for the year ended September 2009
were reduced to 21 pence from 23.8 pence, and the company is
writing off a total 117 million pounds ($185 million) in
receivables in the U.K. business after faults in integrating
computer systems, Crawley, England-based TUI Travel said today
in a statement.  Porsche SE  lost 3.5 percent to 38.40 euros, erasing
yesterday’s advance. The carmaker wants permission from
shareholders to possibly sell convertibles bonds as a way to
raise capital and reduce debt, according to the company’s
invitation for next month’s annual general meeting.  Deutsche Wohnen AG  sank 7 percent to 8.65 euros, the
biggest decline since November. Bank of America Corp. said it
sold 9.3 million Deutsche Wohnen shares for 8.25 euros apiece on
