MTN Group Ltd. , Africa’s largest
mobile-phone operator, said it raised about 2.8 billion rand
($404 million) selling shares under a plan to encourage more
investments by by black South Africans.  The offer through the company’s Zakhele stock-sale program
was more than 1.7 times subscribed and the number of applicants
exceeded 124,000, Johannesburg-based MTN said in a statement
today. More than 95 percent of applications were from
individuals, according to the company, which was seeking a
“broad-based” investment by South African citizens.  Companies in South Africa are required by law to sell
stakes to black shareholders to increase black people’s
ownership and participation in the economy to make up for
exclusion under apartheid, which ended in 1994. MTN said on July
15 that it will sell a stake of as much as 4 percent to black
investors and employees to comply with the law.  MTN  gained  as much as 1.48 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 123.03
rand and cost 123 rand as of 10:26 a.m. in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
