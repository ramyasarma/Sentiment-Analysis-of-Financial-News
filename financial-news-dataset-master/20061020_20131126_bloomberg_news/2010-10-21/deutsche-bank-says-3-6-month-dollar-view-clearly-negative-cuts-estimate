Deutsche Bank AG cut its forecasts

the period is “clearly negative.”  The German bank raised its estimate for the euro to $1.45
for both the end of the year and the end of the first quarter
next year, up from $1.30 and $1.35 respectively,  Bilal Hafeez ,
global head of foreign-exchange strategy in London, said today
in a research note. His prediction for the end of next year is
$1.30, according to the note.  Deutsche Bank forecasts the yen will strengthen to 75
against the dollar over the same period, according to the
