A trending measure of  the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  sent out its first sell signal since August
this week, suggesting the rally in U.S. shares may have entered
“a much needed pause,” according to Concept Capital Inc.  The  Moving Average Convergence/Divergence line , calculated
by subtracting the S&P 500’s average level during the past 26
days from the average over the past 12 days, crossed this week
below the “signal line” that plots the 9-day average
difference between the two. The indicator shows the benchmark
stock index, which has rallied 15 percent since this year’s low
on July 2, may erase some gains or struggle to make new highs.  It’s “a sign price momentum is slowing,” John Kolovos and
Craig Peskin, co-heads of technical analysis research at Concept
Capital, wrote in a note yesterday.  The benchmark for U.S. equities on Oct. 19 posted its
biggest drop since August, tumbling 1.6 percent to 1,165.90,
amid concern banks will be forced to buy back bad mortgages.
While the decline marked the fourth “distribution day,” or
broad selloff, in two months, the S&P 500 managed to hold the
“ support level”  at its average during the past 20 days,
Kolovos and Peskin said.  The S&P 500’s 20-day moving average stood at 1,156.229 on
Oct. 19 and 1,158.423 yesterday. The index rallied 1.1 percent
to 1,178.17 yesterday as earnings topped analyst estimates at
companies including Yahoo! Inc. and Boeing Co. and investors
speculated the Federal Reserve will pump more cash into the
economy.  “Stocks remain on an upward trajectory longer term,” the
analysts wrote. “Additional distribution, an expansion in 20-
day lows, and continued weakness in ‘risk assets’ would be
indications for greater concern.”  The MACD last crossed below the signal line on August 11
and the S&P 500 went on to drop an additional 3.7 percent by the
end of August. It rose back above the signal line on Sept. 2 and
the S&P 500 went on to rally 8.8 percent in the month, its best
September since 1939.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
