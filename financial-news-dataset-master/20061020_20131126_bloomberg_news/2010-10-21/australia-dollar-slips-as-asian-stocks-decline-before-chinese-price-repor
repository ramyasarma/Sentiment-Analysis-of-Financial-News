The Australian dollar retreated as
Asian shares fell and ahead of Chinese data that may add to the
case for Asia’s biggest economy to take more tightening
measures.  The so-called Aussie weakened versus 12 of its 16 major
counterparts as economists said reports today will show China’s
consumer price index, retail sales and industrial production
expanded at a faster pace in September. The currency remained
within two U.S. cents of parity on speculation the Federal
Reserve will inject more money into the world’s largest economy,
debasing the greenback.  “The Australian dollar could be quite sensitive to which
of the numbers comes in weaker or stronger than expected
today,” said Ray Attrill, global research director at Forecast
Ltd. in Sydney. “A strong CPI number has some potential to
spark some more risk averse moves because it means China
suddenly is worried that its inflation problem is getting
bigger.”  Australia’s dollar traded at 98.55 U.S. cents as of 12:02
p.m. in Sydney from 98.71 cents in New York yesterday. It
climbed to $1.0004 on Oct. 15, the highest since the currency
was freely floated in 1983. The Aussie was at 79.92 yen from
80.04 yen, after rising to 81.83 yen on Oct. 7, the strongest
since May 17.  New Zealand’s dollar bought 75.31 U.S. cents from 75.50
cents, and was at 61.07 yen from 61.22 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 0.2 percent today,
while Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.3 percent.  Fed Speculation  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 1.1 percent yesterday
on speculation the Fed will take more credit-easing measures to
support growth. A Fed regional survey showed the U.S. economy
grew at a “modest pace” in September and early October with
little sign of accelerating and companies still hesitant to
hire.  “For the next two weeks, it’s all about the Fed because
the reality is they’re printing money and they’re targeting the
U.S. dollar,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist at ICAP
Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “We could see the Aussie dollar
bounce over parity and maybe hold there for a good portion of
next year, depending on what the Fed does.”  The consumer price index in China, Australia’s biggest
trade partner, increased 3.6 percent in September from the year
before, according to the median estimate of economists. The
gauge expanded by 3.5 percent in August. The nation’s gross
domestic product expanded 9.5 percent in the third quarter from
a year ago after growing 10.3 percent in the second quarter,
according a separate survey.  China increased its benchmark lending and deposit rates on
Oct. 19 after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in 22
months. The one-year deposit rate will climb to 2.5 percent from
2.25 percent, the People’s Bank of China said on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
