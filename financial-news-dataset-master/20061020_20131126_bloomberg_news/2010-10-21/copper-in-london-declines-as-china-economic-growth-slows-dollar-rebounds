Copper dropped as China’s economy
grew at the slowest pace in a year in the third quarter and the
dollar rebounded. Zinc gained to a six-month high.  The metal for three-month delivery fell as much as 0.8
percent to $8,272.50 a metric ton, and traded at $8,305 a ton at
3:35 p.m. in Singapore. Copper rebounded from a one-week low
yesterday as the  dollar  slumped by the most in three-and-a-half
months against a six-currency basket. It reached a 27-month high
of $8,492 a ton on Oct. 19.  Economic growth in China, the largest metals user, was 9.6
percent in the third quarter, the statistics bureau said today,
the smallest gain in a year. Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent,
matching the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “China’s economic data didn’t surprise anyone and
investors are just taking the opportunity to take profit,” Lin
Ling, an analyst at Industrial Futures Co., said from Shanghai.
“The world is still awash with liquidity and that’s going to
keep driving prices higher as investors look for places to put
their money.”  China’s interest rate increase two days ago, the first
since 2007, highlighted the government’s confidence in the
nation’s recovery and concern at asset-bubble and inflation
risks. The rate hike may not curb gains in metal prices, and is
unlikely to restrain demand, traders and analysts said yesterday.  December-delivery copper on the Comex in New York lost as
much as 0.7 percent to $3.7665 a pound, while the metal for
January delivery in Shanghai was little changed at 62,690 yuan
($9,433) a ton, after rising as much as 0.8 percent earlier.  ‘Temporary Pullbacks’  “After the steep rally, commodities are vulnerable for
temporary pullbacks,”  Tobias Merath , head of commodity research
at Credit Suisse AG, wrote in a note yesterday. The bank expects
copper to trade between $8,400 and $8,600 at the end of the year,
up from an earlier estimate of $7,800-$8,000. It also increased
its end-2011 forecast to $8,800-$8,900 from $8,500-$8,700 a ton.  Copper, used in construction and household appliances, is
up 8 percent in the past month as the Dollar Index declined 4
percent against six major currencies including the euro and yen.
The dollar fell against the euro before a report forecast to
show a gauge of leading indicators failed to accelerate last
month.  The dollar has come under “significant pressure” as
markets expect the Federal Reserve to resume asset purchases and
“this environment is directing strong investment flows into
commodity markets,” said Merath.  Copper demand exceeded supply by 161,000 tons in the first
eight months of the year, compared with a surplus of 16,000 tons
a year earlier, the World Bureau of Metal Statistics said
yesterday. Stockpiles tallied by the London Metal Exchange have
fallen 26 percent this year.  Zinc Gains  Zinc gained as much as 1.2 percent to $2,468 a ton, the
highest price since April, on speculation Shenzhen Zhongjin
Lingnan Nonfemet Co., China’s third-largest producer of the
metal, halted production at its smelter in Guangdong province.
Trading of Zhongjin shares was suspended today pending a company
announcement.  “There is talk that the company has stopped production at
its Shaoguan smelter because of an environmental issue and about
250,000 tons of capacity has been affected,” said Huang Jianyun,
an analyst at Maike Futures Co.  Aluminum in London fell 0.3 percent to $2,354 a ton, lead
climbed 0.6 percent to $2,464.50 a ton, and nickel lost 0.6
percent to $23,800 a ton. Tin gained 0.3 percent to $26,825 a
ton at 3:39 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
