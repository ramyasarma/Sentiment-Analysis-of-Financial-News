Mexico’s peso increased to the
strongest level in a week after a gauge of economic prospects in
the U.S., the nation’s largest trading partner, signaled the
recovery will extend into next year.  The peso added less than 0.1 percent to 12.3908 per dollar
at 5 p.m. from 12.3963 yesterday after advancing to 12.3361
earlier today, the strongest level since Oct. 14. The currency
has climbed 5.7 percent this year.  “The best thing for Mexico is for the U.S. to continue
growing,” said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with Banco
Santander SA in Mexico City.  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. dropped 23,000 to
452,000 in the week ending Oct. 16, the Labor Department said.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s general economic index rose
to 1 from minus 0.7 in September, signaling growth. The U.S.
purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to at 6.35 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 0.24 centavo to
133.96 centavos per peso.  The Mexican economy will grow 4.8 percent this year,
Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said yesterday. The government
previously said the economy would expand 4.5 percent, after
contracting 6.5 percent last year. Mexico added 58,569 formal
jobs in the first half of October, Labor Minister  Javier Lozano 
said yesterday.  “The growth outlook continues to be positive for Mexico,”
said  Ramon Cordova , a currency strategist at Base Internacional
Casa de Bolsa SA in Monterrey, Mexico. “The markets are showing
that there is risk appetite.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
