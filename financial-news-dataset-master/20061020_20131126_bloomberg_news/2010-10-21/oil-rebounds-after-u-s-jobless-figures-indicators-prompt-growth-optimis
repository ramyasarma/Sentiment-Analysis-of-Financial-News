Oil climbed, trimming its second
weekly loss, on speculation a recovery in the U.S. economy, the
world’s biggest crude consumer, will stoke fuel demand.  Futures retraced some of yesterday’s 2.4 percent decline as
Asian equity markets gained and investors bought contracts
against a weakening dollar. Jobless claims fell in the U.S., the
world’s largest economy, while the New York-based Conference
Board’s index of leading economic indicators climbed, matching
the forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “For the short term, the positive economic indicators
should support the prices,” said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund
manager at Astmax Ltd. in Tokyo. “Fundamentals aren’t what
people are looking at for the market, but currencies and
financial market conditions.”  The December contract added as much as 81 cents, or 1
percent, to $81.37 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $81.34 at 2:14 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday it declined $1.98 to $80.56. The
contract is down 1 percent this week, heading for its second
weekly loss.  Labor Department figures yesterday showed U.S. initial
jobless claims dropped by 23,000 to 452,000 in the week ended
Oct. 15.  ‘Positive Fundamentals’  “Fundamental signals were positive, with oil output in
China at near record levels, suggesting strong demand for
crude,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in a note
today. “Economic data from other key nations were also
positive, with U.S. jobless claims declining last week.”  Chinese crude production gained 9 percent in September, the
National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. Oil refining
reached 8.5 million barrels a day last month, China Mainland
Marketing Research Co. said.  The  MSCI  Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.5 percent to 130.32
as of 2:14 p.m. in Singapore. Futures on the U.S. Standard &
Poor’s index advanced 0.2 percent.  Oil also rose as the dollar fell against the euro, boosting
the appeal of commodities as an inflation hedge. The greenback
dropped after U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said
nations should use policy tools including exchange rates to
reduce trade imbalances. The dollar declined to $1.3961 per euro
as of 2 p.m. in Singapore from $1.3920 in New York yesterday.  “Oil still remains quite volatile, there’s no doubt about
it,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity
Broking Services Pty in Sydney. “Crude is a little bit mixed in
terms of its outlook. It’s still within its range of $84 on the
topside and $79.50 on the downside.”  European Refiners  European oil refiners are getting the most  profit  from
processing crude in two years as strikes in France curb
production and winter heating-fuel demand rises.  The return from converting crude into fuels such as
gasoline and diesel was $4.88 a barrel in the first two weeks of
October, the highest level since 2008, according to data from  BP
Plc . That compares with an average of $2.59 in the third quarter
of this year.  Nine out of 11 refineries in France have ceased production
and two are running at reduced rates amid protests that began at
ports on Sept. 27 before escalating over President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s planned pension overhaul. Total SA, France’s biggest
oil company, has five sites offline, while Petroplus Holdings AG
has two that are affected.  Brent crude for December settlement gained as much as 82
cents, or 1 percent, to $82.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Yesterday it slipped $1.77, or 2.1
percent, to $81.83.  Oil may decline next week after China’s oil processing grew
the least in 18 months as government measures to cool the
economy reduced fuel demand, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Fourteen of 30 analysts, or 47 percent, forecast crude oil
will fall through Oct. 29. Eleven respondents, or 37 percent,
predicted prices will be little changed and five estimated an
increase. Last week analysts were split over whether futures
would drop or climb.  To contact the reporter on this story:
