Antitrust complaints against  Google
Inc.  are still being reviewed by the European Union, the
region’s competition chief said today.  Joaquin Almunia , the EU antitrust commissioner, said he is
still studying “a number of complaints” made against Google
and hasn’t decided whether to open a formal probe.  A “case that has created headlines concerns a number of
complaints against Google, which were made public by the company
itself,” Almunia said at an antitrust conference in Brussels
today. “We are presently analyzing the comments we have
received from the company but no decision has been taken as to
whether we will open formal proceedings.”  U.K. price-comparison site  Foundem , French legal search
engine  Ejustice.fr  and Microsoft Corp. service  Ciao from Bing 
filed an antitrust complaint against Google in February. Google,
based in Mountain View, California, said at the time it hoped
its arguments would convince the commission not to open a full
antitrust probe.  Al Verney, a spokesman for Google, didn’t immediately
respond to a call seeking comment today.  On Sept. 25, the commission said it had closed
investigations into Apple Inc.’s practices after it relaxed
restrictions on the development tools for iPhone applications
and introduced cross-border iPhone warranty repair services
within the EU region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
