Colombia won’t announce any steps to
ease gains in the currency following a meeting today involving
President Juan Manuel Santos, the central bank’s board, Finance
Ministry officials and government economic advisors, according
to an official from the president’s office who couldn’t be named
because of government policy.  Discussions on addressing the currency’s appreciation will
continue, the official said. The central bank, whose board meets
next week, is currently purchasing at least $20 million daily to
stem the peso’s gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
