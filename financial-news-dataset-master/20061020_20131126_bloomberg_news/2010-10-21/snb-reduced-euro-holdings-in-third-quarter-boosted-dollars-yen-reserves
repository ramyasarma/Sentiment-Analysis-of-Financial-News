The Swiss central bank reduced its
holdings of foreign currencies in the third quarter after a
depreciating euro sparked a loss in the year’s first half.  The  Swiss National Bank  held 90.9 billion euros ($127.4
billion) at the end of September, down from 120.6 billion euros
in the second quarter, it said in its  monthly statistical
bulletin  on its website today. Overall currency holdings fell to
216.7 billion francs ($225 billion) from 226.7 billion francs,
with euros accounting for 56 percent, down from 71 percent.  The SNB in June suspended its currency purchases after
quadrupling the holdings over the previous 15 months in a bid to
curb the franc’s gains and ward off  deflation risks . The franc
appreciated around 12 percent versus the euro in the first half
of the year, resulting in a 14.3 billion franc loss on the
central bank’s currency reserves for the same period.  “They’ve been diversifying their reserves,” said
 Alexander Koch , an economist at UniCredit Group in Munich.
“They want to reduce the risk stemming from the valuation of
their currencies, mainly from the bulk of euro holdings.”  Dollar holdings increased to $54.6 billion from $44.9
billion from the second quarter and holdings of the Japanese yen
increased to 1.79 trillion ($22.1 billion) from 716.3 billion.
The SNB held 9 billion Canadian dollars, up from 3.8 billion.
The central bank also increased reserves of British pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
