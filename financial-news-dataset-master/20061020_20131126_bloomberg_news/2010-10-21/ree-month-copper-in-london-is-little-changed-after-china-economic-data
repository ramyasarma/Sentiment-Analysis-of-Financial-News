Copper, trading little changed, may
decline as China’s economy grew at the slowest pace in a year in
the third quarter and as the dollar rebounded.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange traded at $8,331 a metric ton by 10:41 a.m. Singapore
time, after falling as much as 0.3 percent to $8,311.50 a ton
earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
