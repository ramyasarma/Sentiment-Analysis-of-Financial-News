Spain sold 3.85 billion euros ($5.4
billion) of bonds maturing in 2025 and 2032, less than the
maximum target as demand fell from the previous auction. Bonds
declined after the sale.  Spain sold 2.91 billion of bonds maturing July 2025 at an
average yield of 4.541 percent, the Bank of Spain said, compared
with 5.116 percent when the securities were last sold on July
15. It also sold 941 million of bonds due July 2032, at 4.777
percent compared with a secondary-market rate of 4.806 percent
before the auction. Demand for the 15-year bond was 1.44 times
the amount sold, compared with 2.57 times at the July auction,
while the bid-to-cover ratio for the 2032 paper was 1.42.  “The result looks mixed: demand seems weaker than at the
previous auctions,” said  Chiara Cremonesi , a fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit Bank AG in London. She estimates Spain
still has to sell about 16 billion euros of debt this year,
requiring a “slight speed-up in the pace of issuance.”  “Investors will continue to carefully monitor Spain over
the next few months,” she said in a note.  Spain’s  budget deficit  is set to be the second-largest in
the euro region this year, at 9.3 percent of gross domestic
product, according to government forecasts. Next year, when it
aimed to cut the deficit to 6 percent -- in line with France’s
projected shortfall -- it faces redemptions amounting to almost
20 percent of its total outstanding debt, Treasury data showed.  ‘Not Impressive’  The yield on the 2032 bond on the secondary market rose to
4.835 percent after the auction from 4.791 percent yesterday.
The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish benchmark  bonds 
instead of German equivalents rose to 167.1 basis points from
161.8 basis points yesterday.  “Not impressive results, but not worrying either,” said
 Ioannis Sokos , an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas in
London. “If there was any news this week it’s positive, as the
parliament passed the budget.”  Spain’s parliament backed the government’s 2011 budget bill
yesterday in a preliminary vote, clearing the way for the
deepest budget cuts in three decades and for the Socialist
government to complete the remaining year and a half of its
term. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero shuffled his
Cabinet after the vote, promoting a new deputy prime minister
and foreign minister.  The 2032 bond was added to the quarterly borrowing
schedule on Oct. 15. The Treasury aimed to increase the bond’s
liquidity and the decision doesn’t reflect extra borrowing
needs, said an official at the Finance Ministry who declined to
be identified in line with policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
