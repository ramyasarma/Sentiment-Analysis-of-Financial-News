Wheat fell to the lowest level in
almost two weeks on speculation that rain will improve early
development of winter crops in the U.S. Great Plains.  Growing regions in the Plains may get 0.8 inch (2
centimeters) of rain in the next two days, with some areas
getting as much as 1.5 inches, World Weather Inc. said in a
report. Most of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and eastern Nebraska
have had less than half the normal amount of precipitation this
month, according to the  National Weather Service .  “No doubt the prospect of better rain in hard-red winter-
wheat areas put a little damper on the market,” said  Jim Hemminger , a risk-management specialist at Top Third Ag
Marketing in Chicago.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 14.25 cents, or
2.1 percent, to close at $6.6875 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $6.67, the
lowest level since Oct. 8. The grain has jumped 39 percent since
the end of June after drought in Russia and Eastern Europe
slashed output.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
