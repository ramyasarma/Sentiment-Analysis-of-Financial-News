Sugar loading at Brazil’s two main
ports is accelerating and reducing a backlog by half as dry
weather allows vessels to speed up shipments.  Ships waiting to load at the ports of Santos and Paranagua,
Brazil’s first and second largest, fell to 68 today from a
record backlog of 135 in August, according to research firm
Santos Associados Consultoria Ltda. and shipping agency Unimar
Agenciamentos Maritimos. That compares with 42 a year earlier.  Below-average rain is allowing vessels to hasten loading in
Brazil, the world’s largest sugar producer. The  Port of Santos 
received 65 millimeters of rain in October until yesterday, less
than the average 103 millimeters for the first 20 days of the
month over the past 30 years, Brandt said. Mild thunderstorms
are expected in three out of the next 11 days, she said.  “Shipping companies will have plenty of days ahead to try
to bring the lineup back to regular levels,” Desiree Brandt, a
forecaster at Somar Meteorologia, said yesterday in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo.  Vessels waiting to load at the ports are expected to
transport 1.88 million metric tons of sugar, Santos said.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.46 cent, or 1.6
percent, to settle at 28.35 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Prices have doubled since the end of May, and white,
or refined, sweetener has added 55 percent in London. Both are
about 5 percent below their 2010 peaks.  Raw sugar in February reached the highest price since Jan.
15, 1981, and white sugar touched a two-decade high in January.
In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery dropped
$6.70, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $723.90 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
