Mapletree Industrial Trust,
controlled by  Temasek Holdings Pte , jumped on its first trading
day after raising S$938.5 million ($721 million) in an initial
public offering to repay debt and buy properties in Singapore.  Mapletree Industrial, led by Chief Executive Officer  Tham Kuo Wei , surged as much as 29 percent to S$1.20 from the sale
price of 93 Singapore cents, the top end of the range marketed
to investors. The units traded at S$1.18 as of 2:10 p.m.  Asia has taken the lead in IPOs globally this year with
seven of the 10 largest sales worldwide, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Global Logistic Properties  jumped 11
percent on its trading debut earlier this week after raising
S$3.45 billion, Singapore’s biggest IPO since 1993.  Coal India
Ltd.  this week started the 151.5 billion rupee ($3.4 billion)
sale of stock, India’s biggest-ever IPO.  Mapletree Industrial, whose IPO share placement to
institutional and retail investors was about 38 times
subscribed, said today the over-allotment option of 91.75
million units, or 15.4 percent of the total number of units in
the offering, will be exercised in full by the joint
bookrunners.  Mapletree Investments Pte, Temasek’s real estate unit, has
an agreement to subscribe to 359.5 million units in Mapletree
Industrial, according to its prospectus.  Citigroup Inc.,  DBS Group Holdings Ltd .,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  and Standard Chartered Plc arranged the share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
