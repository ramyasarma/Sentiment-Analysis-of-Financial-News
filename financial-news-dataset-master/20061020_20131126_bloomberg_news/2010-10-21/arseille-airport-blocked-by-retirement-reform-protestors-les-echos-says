Access to Marseille airport has been
blocked by protestors against French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
pension reform proposals, daily Les Echos reported, citing
airport management.  Access to the airport is still possible, but there is a
long line of cars because of barriers that the protestors have
put in place, the newspaper cited an unidentified manager as
saying. There are no plans to cancel any flights at present, the
newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
