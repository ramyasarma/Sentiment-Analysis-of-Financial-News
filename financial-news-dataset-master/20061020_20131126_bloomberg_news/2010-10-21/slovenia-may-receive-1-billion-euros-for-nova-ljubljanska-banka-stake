Slovenia may earn as much as 1
billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the sale of the state’s stake in
Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., the country’s biggest lender,
Finance Minister  Franc Krizanic  said.  “We will earn from 500 million euros to 1 billion euros
when the bank gets profitable again,” Krizanic told reporters
in Ljubljana today. He declined to say when that may happen.  The  government  is seeking a strategic partner for the bank
to participate in a 250 million-euro capital increase planned
for Nov. 25. As a short-term measure, it also wants to increase
its stake in Nova Ljubljanska. The government now owns a 48.6
percent holding in the bank along with other state-owned
companies and agencies and to just above 50 percent.  Nova Ljubljanska plans to shrink operations and dispose of
assets in order to reduce the amount of capital needed to
restore its financial strength. The bank is now seeking a 250
million-euro capital increase instead of a previously announced
boost of 400 million euros.  NLB will also scale back operations in Austria, Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Italy and Serbia and sell
its 41 percent stake in Banka Celje, the seventh-biggest bank by
assets in the former Yugoslav nation. NLB currently operates in
18 countries.  The bank needs fresh capital as mounting bad loans from the
worst recession in  Slovenia  in two decades weigh on its balance
sheet. The lender continued to lose money in the first half when
it reported a 35 million euros net loss after an 82 million loss
in 2009, the first in 15 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
