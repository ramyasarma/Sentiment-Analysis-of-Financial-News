Greek and Irish government
securities paced declines by so-called peripheral debt in the
euro region after demand at a Spanish bond auction fell.  Investors demanded an extra 6.79 percentage points of  yield 
to hold Greek 10-year debt instead of benchmark German bunds at
4:45 p.m. in London, 18 basis points more than yesterday. The
yield on Ireland’s 10-year security jumped 21 basis points to
6.64 percent, with the Portuguese 10-year yield 16 basis points
higher at 5.94 percent. The two-year German  note yield  rose to
more than 1 percent for the first time in six months.  Peripheral securities have trailed bunds this year amid
concern that countries from Spain to Greece will struggle to
fund budget deficits that ballooned during the financial crisis.
Spain sold 3.85 billion euros ($5.4 billion) of bonds maturing
in 2025 and 2032, less than the maximum target, data from the
Treasury showed today.  “Today was a big supply day,” said  Mohit Kumar , a fixed-
income strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in London. “People have
not been too impressed” by the result of the Spanish auction,
he said.  Investors bid for 1.44 times the amount of 15-year
securities Spain sold, down from a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.57 at
a July auction.  France also sold debt today, auctioning about 8.5 billion
euros of 2012, 2013, 2015 notes and almost 2 billion euros of
index-linked securities.  Auction Demand  The yield on the 10-year Spanish bond climbed 10 basis
points to 4.17 percent. The spread over bunds increased four
basis points to 1.66 percentage points.  “Demand seems weaker than at the previous auctions,”
 Chiara Cremonesi , a fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in
London, wrote today in a report. “Investors will continue to
carefully monitor Spain over the next few months.”  Greek government bonds have lost 10.5 percent this year
while those from Portugal handed investors a 4.1 percent loss,
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies show. Germany’s notes, perceived to
be the safest in Europe, returned 8.27 percent, and the
Netherlands’ securities made 8.24 percent.  Ireland’s 10-year securities yielded 405 basis points more
than the bund, the most since Oct. 13 based on closing prices,
up from 387 basis points yesterday. The spread between German
and Portuguese bonds widened to 337 basis points.  German bonds declined after the finance ministry said
economic growth will be sustained and reports showed
manufacturing and services industries expanded.  Industrial Growth  Industrial production accelerated in the latter part of the
third quarter, signaling “the economy’s continued expansion,”
Deputy Finance Minister Hans Bernhard Beus said in a monthly
ministry report today. An index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the German  services industry  rose to 56.6 this month
from 54.9 in September, London-based Markit Economics said
today, beating economists’ projections of an unchanged reading.
 Manufacturing  rose to 56.1 from 55.1 in the prior month.  German data is “creating some headlines that fit the more
bearish mood for bunds,” said  Christoph Rieger , head of fixed-
income strategy at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “A lot of
bearishness comes from the front end.”  The yield on the two-year note rose as high as 1.01
percent, the highest since April 12. The 10-year yield rose four
basis points to 2.48 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
