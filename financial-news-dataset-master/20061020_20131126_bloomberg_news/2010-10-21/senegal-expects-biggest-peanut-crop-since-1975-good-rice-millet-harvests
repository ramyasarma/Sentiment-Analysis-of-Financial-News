Senegal is expecting the 2010-2011
peanut harvest to be its most productive in 35 years and is
forecasting good yields for millet and rice, the Agricultural
Ministry said.  The harvest will exceed the 1.08 million metric tons of
peanuts picked in the 2009-10 season, Malick Ba, head
coordinator at the ministry, said yesterday in a phone interview
from the capital, Dakar, without giving an estimate for the
harvest. The previous season gave the highest output since 1975
when 1.2 million tons was harvested, according to agricultural
ministry data.  State researchers are currently calculating the expected
October-November harvest, Ba said. “It’s no longer a question
of whether it will be a bigger harvest than last year’s, but a
question of how much bigger it will be,” he said. The crop is
picked again in April.  Peanuts account for 60 percent of Senegal’s agricultural
exports, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Shipments by  Suneor , the country’s biggest peanut-oil processing
company, account for as much as 50 percent of the world market,
according to a 2007 USDA country report.  Millet production is expected to exceed the 797,107 tons
grown in 2009-2010, and rice output should be more than the
391,271 tons harvested last season, Balde Solme, bureau head for
Direction for Agricultural Analysis and Forecasts, said.  The West African country’s rice output doubled between 2007
and 2009. Power outages that stop irrigation pumps in the
northern rice-growing region may reduce this season’s crop,
Mamour Gaye, technical adviser to the Agricultural Ministry,
said on Aug. 5.  Good rains compensated for those electricity outages, Solme
said.  “The main factor in determining Senegal’s agricultural
output is rainfall patterns, and right now we are in a period of
especially good rains that we expect will continue for several
years to come,” he said.  Senegalese farms employ as much as 75 percent of the
country’s workforce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
