General Mills Inc. showed where U.S.
food prices are headed by making some of its breakfast cereals
and baking products more expensive, according to  Christopher Growe , a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, retail prices for food are
lower than they were in May though the cost of farm commodities
has soared. The food component of the U.S. consumer price index
and a gauge of agricultural-product prices, compiled by UBS AG
and Bloomberg, were used to make the comparison.  General Mills , the maker of Cheerios, Chex and Wheaties,
will raise cereal prices on Nov. 15. The increase will affect
about 25 percent of its cereal production and amount to a “low
single-digit” percentage,  Kirstie Foster , a company
spokeswoman, wrote today in an e-mail.  Prices for some baking mixes are set for “a mid single-
digit increase,” effective Jan. 3, Foster wrote. The company’s
 product lines  include Betty Crocker, Bisquick and Pillsbury.  “While General Mills may be the first of the large food
companies to really press higher on pricing, we believe many
others may follow,” Growe wrote. “It’s just a matter of time,
given what is coming down the pike in the way of inflation.”  The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index for
 farm products  jumped 50 percent between June 7, when it fell to
this year’s low, and yesterday, when it set a record by closing
at 1,770.479. The previous high was set in July 2008.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
