 OMV AG, central Europe’s biggest
oil company, said it will take a charge of about 250 million
euros after the performance of the Strasshof field in Austria,
as well as some activities in Kazakhstan, was below its
expectations.  The company said that the expected production performance
will not be reached at these fields.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
