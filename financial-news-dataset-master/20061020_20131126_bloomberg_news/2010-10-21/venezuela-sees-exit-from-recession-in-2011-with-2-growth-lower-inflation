Venezuelan Finance Minister said the
economy will emerge from recession in 2011, expanding 2 percent,
as the Western Hemisphere’s highest inflation rate slows.  The forecasts are contained in a  2011 budget  proposal that
calls for 204.2 billion bolivars ($47.5 billion) of spending, a
28 percent increase from 2010, Giordani said today. Consumer
prices may rise 23 percent to 25 percent next year and the
government has no plans to devalue the currency, he said.  President  Hugo Chavez  blamed capitalism for the drop in oil
prices last year that caused South America’s third-largest
economy to sink into its first recession since 2003. The
economy, which has contracted for  five consecutive quarters ,
remains mired in recession even as the rest of the region
returns to growth.  “The budget was drafted under the principles of caution
and austerity,” Giordani told lawmakers during a speech at the
National Assembly. “Our economy is now recovering after hitting
bottom last year and we’re at the doors of a new growth cycle.”  Consumer prices rose 28.5 percent from a year earlier in
September.  Venezuela, the largest oil producer in South America,
depends on oil for 95 percent of export revenue and 47 percent
of government spending. The government expects state oil company
 Petroleos de Venezuela SA  to export an average of 2.68 million
barrels a day at a price of $40 a barrel next year. Output will
be 3.18 million barrels a day, Giordani said.  Venezuela often sets a “conservative” oil export price in
the budget in order to protect against volatility in the energy
markets, Vice President  Elias Jaua  said on state television
yesterday. Surplus revenue can go to extra spending, he said.  Spending Credits  Lawmakers have approved more than 37 billion bolivars in
extra spending credits beyond the 2010 budget this year.  Venezuela will boost its debt ceiling 53 percent in 2011 to
54 billion bolivars. Of that amount, 20 billion bolivars will be
used for government spending, 10.7 billion to service debt and
13.6 billion for refinancing, the finance minister said.  “We’ve managed to lower our debt-to-GDP ratio during the
last decade,” Giordani said. “Due to our preference for
borrowing in the local market, 80 percent of our financing needs
in 2010 were met in bolivars.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
