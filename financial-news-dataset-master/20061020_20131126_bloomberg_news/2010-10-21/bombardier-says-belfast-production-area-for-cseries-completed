Bombardier Inc. , the world’s third-
biggest commercial-plane maker, said it finished the first stage
of a plant in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to make composite wings
for the CSeries jet due to be delivered in 2013.  A production area, a low-contamination clean room area and
tool-storage space have been completed, Montreal-based
