Murchison Metals Ltd.  stock jumped
the most in more than a month in Sydney trading after a judge
dismissed a gold explorer’s claim to a share of an iron-ore
project in Western Australia.  Murchison’s  shares  surged 13 percent to A$1.725 at 11:09
a.m. on the Australian stock exchange, the biggest gain since
Sept. 10.  Chameleon Mining NL  shares tumbled 28 percent
yesterday and as much as 43 percent today after Australia
Federal Court Judge  Peter Jacobson  ruled it’s entitled instead
to some profit from the Jack Hills project.  “Jack Hills is a key asset for Murchison, and recent
production increases should have attracted further investor
interest,” said  Chris Weston , a Melbourne-based institutional
dealer at IG Markets. “The fact they get to maintain their
holding on the asset is a positive. No-one wanted to see them
lose a big slice of their revenue stream.”  The iron-ore developer’s shares have slumped 31 percent
this year and last month fell to their lowest level in a year on
speculation partner Mitsubishi Corp. might pull out of an
agreement linked to their 50:50 Crosslands iron-ore joint
venture.  Mitsubishi  denied the reports.  Mitsubishi and Murchison are expected to complete a study
into the expansion of the Jack Hills project by the fourth
quarter, Murchison’s Executive Chairman  Paul Kopejtka  said in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
