Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ,
the largest publicly traded copper producer, reported third-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates and increased its
dividend after output and metal prices climbed. The shares rose.  Net income  gained 27 percent to $1.18 billion, or $2.49 a
share, from $925 million, or $2.07, a year earlier, the Phoenix-
based company said today in a statement. That beat the $2.19 a
share average of 17 analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Freeport said its annual  dividend  will climb to $2 a share from
$1.20.  Chief Executive Officer  Richard Adkerson , 63, is seeking to
exploit rising copper prices by increasing output at mines where
the company reduced output last year and in 2008 as the global
economic slowdown cut demand. Copper for delivery in three
months on the London Metal Exchange averaged $7,278 a metric ton
in the quarter, 24 percent more than a year earlier.  “It was a strong result,”  David Radclyffe , a London-based
metals and mining analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in an e-
mail. He has an “outperform” recommendation on the stock.
“The increase in the annual dividend sends a strong message.”  Freeport  rose  $1.08, or 1.1 percent, to $96.43 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
advanced 20 percent this year.  Sales increased 24 percent to $5.15 billion, beating the
$4.66 billion  average estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue was $4.14 billion a year earlier.  Copper Sales Rise  Copper sales rose to 1.1 billion pounds from 1 billion
pounds. Freeport was expected to sell 974 million pounds in the
quarter, according to the average of estimates from Citigroup
Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley analysts.  “We continue to advance our future growth and expansion
plans and are taking steps to increase near-term copper
production in response to improved physical markets,” Adkerson
said in the statement.  Freeport increased its full-year copper-sales  forecast  to
3.85 billion pounds from a previous prediction of 3.8 billion
pounds. The company also raised its full-year forecast for gold
sales 5.6 percent to 1.9 million ounces and its guidance on
molybdenum sales 3.2 percent to 65 million pounds.  Fourth-quarter sales will be 895 million pounds of copper,
585,000 ounces of gold and 15 million pounds of molybdenum, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
