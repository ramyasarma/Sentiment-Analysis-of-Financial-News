The Swedish krona appreciated
against the dollar and was near its strongest level this week
versus the euro after the employment rate rose for the first
time since June.  A  report  by Stockholm-based Statistics Sweden said the
Nordic nation’s employment rate rose to 64.9 percent in
September, a 0.7 percent increase on a year earlier. The jobless
rate grew to 7.8 percent.  “Growth in employment was stronger than expected,” said
 Carl Hammer , chief currency strategist at SEB AB. “The risk
sentiment has turned once again and the dollar is under
pressure, which has correlated fairly well with the overall
direction of the krona. The weaker dollar has contributed to the
krona’s strength in the last couple of weeks.”  The krona appreciated 0.2 percent to 6.6325 per dollar at
4:25 p.m. in London, rebounding from 6.5982 earlier, the weakest
level since Oct. 15. The Swedish currency was little changed
versus the euro at 9.2823 after earlier appreciating to 9.2508,
its strongest intraday level since Oct. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
