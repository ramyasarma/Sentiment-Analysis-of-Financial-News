New Zealand consumer confidence fell
to a 14-month low in October as a sales-tax increase raised the
cost of household appliances, deterring buyers.  The ANZ-Roy Morgan confidence  index  fell to 113.6 from
116.4 in September, Wellington-based ANZ National Bank Ltd. said
in an e-mailed statement today. The index was the lowest since
August last year and has dropped 17.8 points from a five-year
high in January.  Falling consumer confidence adds to signs of sluggish
spending and a slow economic recovery. Central bank Governor
 Alan Bollard  yesterday said he expected domestic demand to
recover as consumer confidence picks up and the labor market
improves.  The government on Oct. 1 increased the so-called goods-and-
services tax to 15 percent from 12.5 percent. The proportion of
survey respondents who said it was a bad time to buy a major
household appliance surged to 42 percent from 33 percent last
month, ANZ National said.  “Such a large fall suggests the GST rise has been
influential,” it said. The decline “does not bode well for
immediate appetite to spend.”  Still, respondents were more optimistic when asked about
their financial position and the outlook for the  economy . The
government also cut income taxes and raised welfare and pension
payments on Oct. 1.  The proportion of the 1,071 respondents who expect the
economy will deteriorate over the next 12 months fell to 27
percent from 31 percent, while 37 percent expect it will improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
