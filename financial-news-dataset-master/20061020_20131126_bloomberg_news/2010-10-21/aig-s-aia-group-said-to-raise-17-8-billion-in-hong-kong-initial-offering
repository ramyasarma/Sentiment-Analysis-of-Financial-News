American International Group Inc. 
raised about HK$138.3 billion ($17.8 billion) selling shares in
its main Asian unit,  AIA Group Ltd. , in the largest initial
public offering in Hong Kong, a person with knowledge of the IPO
said.  AIG, the bailed-out insurer, sold 5.86 billion existing
shares in AIA at HK$19.68 apiece, the high end of the offering
range, said the person, who declined to be identified before an
official statement. AIG also decided to exercise an option to
sell 1.17 billion more shares at the same price, they added.  Mark Herr , a spokesman for AIG in New York, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
