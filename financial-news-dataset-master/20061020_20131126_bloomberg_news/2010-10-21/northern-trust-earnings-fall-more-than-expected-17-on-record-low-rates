Northern Trust Corp ., the third-
largest U.S. independent custody bank, said third-quarter
earnings fell 17 percent, more than analysts had expected, as
low interest rates squeezed lending and money-market revenue.  Net income dropped to $155.6 million, or 64 cents a share,
from $187.9 million, or 77 cents, a year earlier, the Chicago-
based company said today in a statement. Northern Trust was
expected to earn 71 cents a share, according to the average
 estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Low short-term interest rates have had an ongoing
negative impact,” William Morrison, the bank’s chief financial
officer, said in a conference call.  Northern Trust said in September that record low  rates 
could reduce revenue this year by $300 million compared with
historical levels, based on figures from the first half of the
this year. The Federal Reserve has held its benchmark lending
rate at between zero and 0.25 percent since December 2008,
cutting the net interest margin Northern Trust earns on client
deposits and forcing it to waive fees on money-market funds.  Northern Trust fell $1.51 or 3.1 percent, to $47.41 at 4
p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has lost 9.5
percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s index of  custody
banks and asset managers  is little changed.  Revenue fell 3 percent to $899 million from a year earlier,
below the $922 million analysts had estimated, on declines in
fees from securities lending and foreign-exchange trading, the
company said in the statement. Its net interest margin, or
profit spread on investing customer deposits, fell to 1.44
percent from 1.54 percent.  Assets Rise  Custody assets rose 10 percent to $3.9 trillion while
investment-management assets increased 8 percent to $657.2
billion. The gains were driven by the best quarter for
attracting new business since the fourth quarter of 2007,
Morrison said on the conference call.  Northern Trust’s largest competitors reported improved
third-quarter profit on Oct. 19, helped by acquisitions. Bank of
New York Mellon Corp., the world’s biggest custody bank, earned
$622 million, compared with a loss of $2.46 billion a year
earlier.  State Street Corp ., based in Boston, said operating
profit rose 21 percent to $427 million.  Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities to institutional investors such as pension plans and
hedge funds. Northern Trust also manages mutual funds and
institutional accounts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
