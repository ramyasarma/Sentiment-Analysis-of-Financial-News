Gold futures fell on speculation
that the dollar will rebound, eroding the precious metal’s
appeal as an alternative asset. Silver had the biggest drop in
almost three months.  The greenback rose as much as 0.6 percent against a basket
of major currencies, after tumbling 6.5 percent since Sept. 1.
Before today, gold climbed 23 percent this year, reaching a
record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  “The metals are getting smacked,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. “The magnitude of the decline isn’t equal to the gains
in the dollar, but the gold market was looking for an excuse to
correct.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $18.60, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $1,325.60 at 2:17 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price rose as much as 0.4 percent.  Gold for immediate delivery declined $23.90, or 1.8
percent, $1,322.35 at 2:24 p.m. New York time. Earlier, the
price dropped as much as 2.1 percent to $1,318, the lowest level
since Oct. 6.  Before this week, gold futures rose to a record 16 times in
a month. The metal is headed for the 10th straight annual gain.  “The long-term rally may be a bit overdone,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  Awaiting Fed Decision  Gold may fluctuate until Federal Reserve policy makers meet
in two weeks to decide whether to ease monetary policy further
to help stimulate the U.S. economy, said  Frank Lesh , a trader at
FuturePath Trading in Chicago.  “We have to wait for the Fed to make a decision, and no
one wants to sit in gold for the next several weeks,” Lesh
said. “If we see dollar strength, traders will sell gold.”  Yesterday, holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded fund backed by the metal, decreased 0.91 metric
ton to 1,299.18 tons, the fourth straight decline.  Silver futures for December fell 72.5 cents, or 3 percent,
to $23.139 an ounce, the biggest drop since July 27.  Platinum futures for January delivery declined $13.90, or
0.8 percent, to $1,673.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery fell $4.35, or 0.7
percent, to $586.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
