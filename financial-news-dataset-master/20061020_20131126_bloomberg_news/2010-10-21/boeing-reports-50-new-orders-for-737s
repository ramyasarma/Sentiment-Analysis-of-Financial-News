Boeing Co. , the second-biggest
commercial-jet maker, won an order for 50 single-aisle 737
planes, boosting its backlog as the number of aircraft sold this
year now exceeds expected deliveries.  Boeing declined to say who placed the order, listed in
today’s weekly update on the Chicago-based company’s  website .
The purchase, valued at $3.7 billion at average list prices,
adds to orders for 70 of the model in the past two weeks and
brings the overall net tally this year to 472. That’s more than
triple last year’s orders and surpasses the 460 aircraft that
Boeing said yesterday it aims to deliver this year.  Boeing kept production of the 737, the world’s most widely
flown plane, steady through the recession and plans to increase
it by more than 20 percent over the span of a year starting in
2012. Airlines are recovering from the recession and ordering
new, more fuel-efficient jets to save money on oil and expand.  Boeing’s backlog through September had grown to 3,401
aircraft valued at $255 billion, more than seven years’ worth of
production.  Russian Technologies Corp. decided in June to buy 50 737s
and lease them to OAO Aeroflot and six Russian regional
airlines. The state holding company’s board planned to meet in
October to approve the purchase. Boeing doesn’t list orders in
its backlog until they’re official.  Airbus SAS, based in Toulouse, France, is the world’s
largest maker of commercial jets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
