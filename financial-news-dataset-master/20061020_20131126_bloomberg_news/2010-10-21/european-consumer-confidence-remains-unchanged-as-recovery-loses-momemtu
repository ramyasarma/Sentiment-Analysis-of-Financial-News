European  consumer confidence 
remained unchanged in October as the region’s economic recovery
showed signs of losing momentum.  An index of  consumer sentiment  in the 16-nation euro area
held at minus 11, the same as in September, the Brussels-based
European Commission said today in an initial estimate. That’s in
line with the median forecast of  18 estimates  in a Bloomberg
News survey and the highest since December 2007.  European households may grow more pessimistic as
governments from Portugal to Greece step up efforts to push down
budget deficits just as the region’s  recovery  falters. Growth in
Europe’s  services industries  slowed in October and unemployment
held at the highest in more than 12 years in August.  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area  economic confidence , which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
