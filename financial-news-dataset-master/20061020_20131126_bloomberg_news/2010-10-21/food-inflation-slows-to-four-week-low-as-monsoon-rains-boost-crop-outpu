India’s food inflation slowed to a
four-week low as the heaviest monsoon rainfall in three years
boosted production of rice and corn.  An  index  measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products compiled by the commerce ministry rose 15.53 percent in
the week ended Oct. 9 from a year earlier, according to a
statement in New Delhi today. The index gained 16.37 percent the
previous week.  The Reserve Bank of India is relying on lower farm prices
to cool the benchmark wholesale-price inflation rate to 6
percent by March 31 from 8.62 percent in September. The bank,
which has raised interest rates five times this year, is due to
release its next monetary policy statement on Nov. 2.  “This year’s harvest will moderate inflation,”  Shashanka Bhide , chief economist at the New Delhi-based National Council
of Applied Economic Research, said before the report. “The
central bank may maintain its tight stance until inflation
eases.”  Production of grains including rice sown at the start of
the country’s June-to-September rainy season may rise to 114.63
million tons from 103.84 million tons a year earlier, according
to the farm ministry.  The country got 911 millimeters (35.9 inches) of rainfall
between June 1 and Sept. 29, exceeding the 50-year average of
889.2 millimeters, according to data from the  India
Meteorological Department . That’s the heaviest since 2007 and
matches the agency’s forecast in June.  The central bank’s  reverse repurchase rate  is 5 percent and
the repurchase rate is 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
