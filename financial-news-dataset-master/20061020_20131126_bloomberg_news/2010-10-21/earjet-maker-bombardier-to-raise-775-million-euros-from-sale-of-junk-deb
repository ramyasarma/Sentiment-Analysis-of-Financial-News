Bombardier Inc.  is selling 775
million euros ($1.1 billion) of high- yield bonds in euros, the
commercial plane maker’s first benchmark issue in the currency
for four years.  The 10 1/2 year notes may be priced to yield 6.25 percent
to 6.5 percent, according to two people with knowledge of the
sale, who wouldn’t be identified before the deal is completed.
The Montreal-based company last issued euro  debt  in November
2006 when it raised 800 million-euros ($1.12 billion) of 7.25
percent notes due 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is plenty of demand for quality benchmark-size
deals, so it should go well,” said  Andrew Lake , who helps
manage $393 billion of assets as head of high-yield debt at
Aviva Investors in London. “It’s a well-known issuer with a
good order backlog.”  The Learjet maker said in a statement that it plans to
offer “a new series of euro-denominated senior notes in an
aggregate principal amount equivalent to $1 billion, with
maturities not extending beyond 2021,” to help refinance debt.
It’s offering to buy back floating-rate notes due in 2013 and 8
percent senior notes maturing in 2014. Bombardier has 482
million euros of the floating notes and $385 million of the
fixed notes  outstanding , Bloomberg data show.  The extra yield investors demand to hold high-yield bonds
in euros fell to the lowest since January 2008 this week as
earnings at companies including  Novartis AG ,  Bank of America
Corp . and  Apple Inc.  beat analysts’ forecasts. The spread
narrowed 8 basis points to 557, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data.  The Bombardier issue is being marketed by BNP Paribas SA,
Credit Agricole CIB, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
UBS AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
