Uranium prices will average $52.25 a
pound next year, 19 percent higher than this year, as new
supplies are expected to lag behind an increase in demand for
the nuclear fuel, Morgan Stanley said in a report.  This year through mid-October, uranium oxide concentrate
for immediate delivery averaged $43.78 a pound (0.45 kilogram),
and in 2012 prices are forecast to rise to $60, Morgan Stanley
analysts  Peter Richardson  and  Joel Crane  said in a report today.  Spot uranium was at $49.25 a pound in the week through Oct.
18, according to Roswell, Georgia-based Ux Consulting Co. A
nearly balanced uranium market make prices “vulnerable to
supply shocks and/or new build announcements,” Richardson and
Crane wrote.  This year’s average is 6 percent below last year’s level
and almost 30 percent lower than the average in 2008, according
to the report. “The steady, two-year erosion in uranium prices
has translated into difficult mining breakeven points,
particularly for new uranium projects,” the analysts said.  Lower uranium prices made supply growth “increasingly
dependent” on production from Kazakhstan, the analysts wrote.
Kazakhstan produced 14,020 metric tons of uranium last year,
surpassing Canada as the world’s largest producer, according to
data from the  World Nuclear Association .  Demand for fuel was expected to rise by 24 percent through
2015 as new nuclear plant capacity “is rapidly coming online
and the planned project pipeline is briskly increasing,”
according to the report.  More Nuclear Plants  China is planning to increase its nuclear capacity six-fold
and India aims to add 20 to 30 new reactors by 2020, according
to the WNA. In addition, demand from developed economies is also
set to rise on “concerns over carbon-emission
costs and energy-supply security,” according to the report.  Over the next decade there will be an additional 147
nuclear plants coming online, according to Morgan Stanley.  These plants will require 32,900 tons of nuclear fuel,
almost half of the demand from this year’s 443 commercial
reactors, according to the report. Most of the demand growth
will have to be met by mines as secondary supplies from recycled
Russian warheads may cease with the end of an international
agreement in 2013, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
