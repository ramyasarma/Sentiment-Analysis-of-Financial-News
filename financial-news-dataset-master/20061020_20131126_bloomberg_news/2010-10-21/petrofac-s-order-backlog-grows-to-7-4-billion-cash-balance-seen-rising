Petrofac Plc , the oilfield services
and engineering provider, said that its order backlog has grown
and it expects its cash balance to rise this year.  The order intake in the year to date was $2.6 billion, the
London-based company said in a statement today. That brings the
total backlog to $7.4 billion, compared with $6.9 billion at the
end of June, and the company has received $300 million in
contracts this month.  Petrofac shares  have gained more than 50 percent this year
as the company focuses on the Middle East and the former Soviet
Union, helping  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  at the Majnoon field in
Iraq and winning a gas field contract in the United Arab
Emirates. In Turkmenistan, the company is still in talks with
the government about a $4 billion contract for the second phase
of development of the South Yolotan field.  “We are pleased with our excellent operational performance
during the year to date, with a number of projects either
recently delivered to customers or expected to be delivered
before the end of the year,” Chief Executive Officer  Ayman Asfari  said in the statement. This “underpins our confidence in
2010 and the medium-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
