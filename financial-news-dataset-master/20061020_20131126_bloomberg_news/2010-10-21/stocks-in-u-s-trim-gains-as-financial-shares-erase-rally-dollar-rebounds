U.S. stocks erased  gains  as concern
that banks will face more scrutiny over mortgage transactions
wiped out an early rally in financial companies and a rebound in
the dollar weighed on commodities.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,176.45 at 1:48 p.m. in New York, wiping out a 1 percent rally
triggered earlier by higher-than-estimated earnings. Bank of
America Corp. slumped 3.3 percent and was the biggest drag on
the gauge.  The Dollar Index  rose 0.4 percent after slumping as
much as 0.4 percent earlier. Oil dropped 1.7 percent after
China’s processing grew the least in 18 months amid government
measures to cool the economy.  The earlier rally in stocks was triggered by better-than-
estimated earnings at companies from EBay Inc. to Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
