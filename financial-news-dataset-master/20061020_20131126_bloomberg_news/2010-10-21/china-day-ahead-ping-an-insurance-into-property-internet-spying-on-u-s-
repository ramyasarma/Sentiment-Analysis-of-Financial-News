Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. ,
China’s second-largest insurer, is diversifying into property
and private equity and increasing its holdings in  Chinese stocks 
to boost investment performance after its worst year since 2005.  “Returns are lower than last year and I’d say it’s the
toughest time” in five years, after bond yields and the
benchmark stock index declined,  Timothy Chan , 49, deputy chief
investment officer of Ping An and chairman of its asset
management units, said in an interview at the company’s office
in Shanghai. “The forecast for investment returns in 2011 looks
very similar to this year’s levels.”  The government is widening the investment scope of Ping An
and competitors including  China Life Insurance Co. , which held
most assets in bonds and bank deposits, limiting returns. Ping
An had 86 percent of its portfolio invested in fixed income and
9 percent in equities at the end of June, according to Chan.  China U.S. Internet  China in the past year demonstrated it can direct Internet
traffic, giving the nation the capability to exploit
“hijacked” data from the U.S. military and other sources,
according to a new report.  Recent actions raise questions that “China might seek
intentionally to leverage these abilities to assert some level
of control over the Internet,” according to excerpts from the
final draft of an annual report by the  U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission . “Any attempt to do this would
likely be counter to the interests of the United States and
other countries.”  On April 8,  China Telecom Corp. , the nation’s third-largest
mobile-phone  company , instructed U.S. and other foreign-based
Internet servers to route traffic to Chinese servers, the report
said. The 18-minute re-routing included traffic from the U.S.
military, the Senate and the office of Defense Secretary  Robert Gates .  U.S. Query on Rare Earths  U.S. Representative  Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat,
asked members of the Obama administration to explain specifics
of China’s curbs on the export of rare earths and what such
restrictions will mean for the military and U.S. clean-energy
producers.  Markey sent a letter to Energy Secretary  Steven Chu ,
Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Commerce Secretary  Gary Locke 
and U.S. Trade Representative  Ron Kirk .  HSBC Scolded in South Africa  HSBC Holdings Plc ’s manner of ending talks to buy a
controlling stake in  Nedbank Group Ltd.  was “irresponsible,”
according to South Africa’s financial regulator.  “HSBC was irresponsible” in how it terminated the
discussions, which “caused extensive speculation with regard to
the affairs of Nedbank,” Bert Chanetsa, deputy executive
officer at the Pretoria-based  Financial Services Board , said in
an e-mailed statement. “This is likely to result in a further
negative impact on the share price.”  A spokesman for HSBC in London declined to comment when
reached by Bloomberg.  Cnooc Surrenders Kenya Licenses  Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore energy explorer, told
the Kenyan government it plans to drop licenses to search for
oil and gas in two  Kenyan  blocks by December, an official said.  “They didn’t discover anything so they don’t want to
continue,” Mines and Energy Ministry Permanent Secretary
 Patrick Nyoike  said in an interview in Nairobi, the capital. The
Chinese company had licenses to explore in block 9 in northern
Kenya and L2, an inland area in the Lamu Basin.  Beijing Explosion  An explosion near a subway station in Beijing’s downtown
Dongcheng district this afternoon slightly injured one U.S.
citizen, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing local police.  The blast at 3:20 p.m. local time beside a newspaper stand
near the Dongzhimen subway station, Xinhua said. The 30-year-old
American, who is studying in China, was injured in the leg when
passing by and was sent to a nearby hospital.  Sihuan IPO  Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd.  raised HK$5.75
billion ($741 million) by selling stock in its Hong Kong initial
public offering at the top of a price range marketed to
investors.  The company sold 1.25 billion shares at HK$4.60 each,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley and UBS
AG managed the transaction. The shares had been offered at
HK$3.88 to HK$4.60 apiece.  LontohCoal IPO  LontohCoal , a closely held South African miner, said it
plans to raise between $300 million and $500 million from an
initial public offering in Hong Kong.  The company, based in Johannesburg, may sell shares in Hong
Kong as early as the first half of 2011, spokeswoman Lizelle du
Toit said by phone from the South African commercial capital.
Investors in Hong Kong “understand the risk of doing business”
in Zimbabwe, where LontohCoal has one of its three mines, she
said.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark indexes higher for a
second day, as better-than-estimated earnings from EBay Inc. to
 McDonald’s Corp.  and a drop in jobless claims helped offset a

more losses from bad mortgages.  EBay , the owner of the second-most visited e-commerce site,
jumped 6 percent, while  McDonald’s  climbed 1.3 percent.  Netflix
Inc. , the movie-rental service, surged 13 percent after raising
