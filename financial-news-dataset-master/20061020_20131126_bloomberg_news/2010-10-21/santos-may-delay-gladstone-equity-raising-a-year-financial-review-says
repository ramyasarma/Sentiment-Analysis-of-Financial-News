Santos Ltd. may delay a potential
equity raising until after a final investment decision next year
on a second plant for its Gladstone liquefied natural gas
project in Queensland, the Australian Financial Review said in
its Street Talk column, citing Goldman Sachs Group analyst Aiden
Bradley. The oil and gas producer may need to raise between
A$600 million and A$1 billion, the newspaper said, citing
Goldman estimates. The company is awaiting environmental
approvals and is yet to make a development decision on the first
plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
