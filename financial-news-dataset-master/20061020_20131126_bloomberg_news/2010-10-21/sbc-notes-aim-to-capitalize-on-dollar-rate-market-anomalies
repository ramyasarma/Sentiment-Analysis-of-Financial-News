HSBC Holdings Plc  sold 10 million
euros ($13.8 million) of seven-year notes that aim to benefit
from differences between dollar yields implied by futures
traders and actual U.S. interest rates.  The notes pay a coupon of 4.2 percent in the first year and
then switch to the performance of the bank’s  Dynamic Term
Premium Index , a proprietary benchmark that tracks arbitrage
opportunities in Eurodollar futures, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The index gained 18.7 percent this year.  In the second year, investors get a coupon of 28 percent of
the index’s gains, reducing to 9 percent by the final year. The
notes have a coupon floor of zero percent.  Eurodollar futures are based on expectations for the three-
month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and are used to
bet on or hedge against changes in U.S. interest rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
