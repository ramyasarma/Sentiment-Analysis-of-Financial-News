TUI Travel Plc , Europe’s largest
tour operator, said it accepted the resignation of Chief
Financial Officer  Paul Bowtell  after having to restate its 2009
results. The shares fell the most in more than two months.  Bowtell, 42, will leave at the end of 2010, the Crawley,
England-based company said today in a statement. The executive
decided it was “appropriate” to offer his resignation after
talks with Chief Executive Officer  Peter Long , TUI Travel said.  The tour operator said it wrote off 117 million pounds
($185 million) in its U.K. business after faults in integrating
computer systems following the 2007 merger of First Choice
Holidays Plc and the tourism unit of TUI AG. The amount is 88
million pounds more than the company announced in August.  “The whole thing is an unexpected shock,” said  John Beaumont , an analyst at Matrix Group Capital in London. “The
uncertainty now is who’s going to replace him?”  TUI Travel  fell  as much as 23.6 pence, or 10 percent, to
206.8 pence, the  steepest  intraday drop since Aug. 10. The stock
was down 9.9 percent as of 10:40 a.m. in London.  Underlying earnings per share for the year ended September
2009 were reduced to 21 pence from 23.8 pence, TUI Travel said.  Bowtell, who joined First Choice Holidays in 2004 after
working for British Gas, WH Smith Plc and Forte Plc, is
“behaving honorably” in resigning, Long said.  TUI Travel said it “remains confident” that results for
the year ending Sept. 30 will be in line with previous forecasts
and  net debt  will be lower.  “If this was an ongoing issue for the company resulting in
downgrades to current estimates, it would be more of a problem,
but it doesn’t look as though that’s the case,” said Beaumont.  Panmure Gordon & Co. cut its  recommendation  on the shares
to “sell” from “hold” today, citing the valuation.  Before today, the  stock  had fallen 9.7 percent this year,
compared with a 20 percent decline in shares of its nearest
competitor  Thomas Cook Group Plc .  To contact the reporter on this story:
