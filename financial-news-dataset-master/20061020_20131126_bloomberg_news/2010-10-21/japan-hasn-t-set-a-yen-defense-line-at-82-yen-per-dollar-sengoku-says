Japan hasn’t set a line to defend
its currency at 82 yen per dollar, the government’s top
spokesman said today in clarifying remarks made last month.  “The Finance Minister and the Prime Minister have held
talks about the rising yen,” Chief Cabinet Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku  said today in parliament. “It wasn’t about whether 82
yen was the line, but that the Finance Ministry will monitor the
currency markets and we’ll take decisive measures appropriately
at an appropriate timing.”  Sengoku said last month the Ministry of Finance “seems to
think” the level of 82 yen per dollar needs to be defended. The
remark was made after Japan intervened in the foreign-exchange
market for the first time since 2004.  The yen retreated today to 81.20 to the dollar at 11:12 a.m.
from a 15-year high of 80.85 shortly before midnight yesterday
in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
