EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, the biggest
publicly traded Arab investment bank, was rated “outperform”
in new coverage at Credit Suisse Group AG, citing an increase in
trading.  “Equities’ trading volumes appear to have troughed as we
have started to see a pick-up in activity following the
summer/Ramadan season,” London-based analyst Mohamad Hawa wrote
in a report today. “From a medium- to long-term perspective,
the potential inclusion of GCC countries in the MSCI EM index
would imply not only higher trading volumes, but also increased
structural demand from institutional investors.”  Credit Suisse set a share-price estimate of 38 Egyptian
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
