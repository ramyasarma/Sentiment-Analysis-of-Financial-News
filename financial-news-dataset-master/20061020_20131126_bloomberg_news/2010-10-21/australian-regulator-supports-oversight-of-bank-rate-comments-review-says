The Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission will support being given powers preventing
banks from publicly indicating to competitors future interest
rate rises, the Australian Financial Review reported, citing an
interview with regulator chairman Graeme Samuel. Treasury says
more action is needed to rein in the big four banks and called
for laws to deal with potential collusion on rate changes, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
