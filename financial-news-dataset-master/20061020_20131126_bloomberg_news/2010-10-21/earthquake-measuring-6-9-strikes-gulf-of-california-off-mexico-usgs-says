A magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck
the Gulf of California, sending shockwaves that were felt more
than 680 miles away in San Diego. There were no immediate
reports of injury.  The temblor, which hit at 11:53 a.m. Pacific Coast time,
was centered off-shore about 100 miles east of the resort town
of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, the U.S. Geological Survey said in a
statement on its  website .  The Mexican state of Baja California Sur hasn’t received
any reports of earthquake damage, state civil protection
spokesman Jose Gajon de Toba said in a telephone interview.  Grupo Mexico SAB , the nation’s largest mining company, had
no reports of damage from the 6.9-magnitude quake, spokesman
 Juan Rebolledo  said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
