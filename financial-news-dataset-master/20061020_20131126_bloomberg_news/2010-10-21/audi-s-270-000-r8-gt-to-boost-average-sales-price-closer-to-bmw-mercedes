Volkswagen AG ’s Audi aims to compete
on pricing with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG’s
Mercedes-Benz with its most expensive model ever: The R8 GT.  The vehicle, which costs 193,000 euros ($270,000) in
Germany, is part of a broader  expansion  of Audi’s model range
which may include a third sports-car line in addition to the R8
and TT, Stephan Reil, development chief at Audi’s Quattro
sports-car division, said in an interview.  High-end sports cars are important to Audi because they
help the automaker increase the price customers are willing to
pay across the entire model range by raising the brand’s overall
appeal. Audi, which lags behind BMW and  Mercedes  in pricing
power, has spent the last decade boosting its offerings.  “The more Audi advances as a premium manufacturer, the less
necessary will it be for them to offer lower prices,” said
Sascha Heiden, senior analyst at IHS Automotive in Frankfurt.  The average price Audi currently gets for a car in the
U.S., the largest market for luxury autos, is $43,820, or
$12,630 less than Mercedes and $7,829 lower than  BMW , according
to automotive website Edmunds.com.  “This car will naturally have a positive impact on the
flagship Audi brand,” Reil said at the Ingolstadt, Germany-
based carmaker’s headquarters. “We can imagine many options,
you’ll have to wait and be surprised,” he said of new models.  Sports-Car Line  Audi Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Stadler  is adding the
R8 GT, which will be limited to 333 cars, four years after the
R8 coupe. The new GT version has a more powerful engine, revised
aerodynamics and carbon-fiber components that cut 100 kilograms
(220 pounds) off the weight. Production started this month and
Audi expects the car to sell out by year’s end, Reil said.  Audi, the biggest contributor to VW’s profit, is open to
adding a third sports-car line positioned between the R8 and TT
models, he said in an interview Oct. 14. The TT RS coupe base
price is 56,150 euros in Germany, while the R8 coupe starts at
109,100 euros.  Volkswagen’s preferred shares rose 2.98 euros, or 3.2
percent, to 96.76 euros in Frankfurt today after VW unexpectedly
reported a sixfold increase in nine-month profit. The  stock  has
gained 48 percent this year, valuing the Wolfsburg, Germany-
based carmaker at 41.6 billion euros.  Audi has pledged to increase deliveries to 1.5 million
vehicles and dethrone BMW as the world’s largest luxury-car
maker by 2015. Audi targets record sales of more than 1.08
million vehicles this year.  Image-Making  “Audi is refining the top end of its portfolio,” said
 Stefan Bratzel , director of the Center of Automotive Management
at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch-Gladbach,
Germany. “The R8 GT has a considerable effect in terms of
image-making.”  Under  Martin Winterkorn , who ran Audi before becoming VW
CEO in 2007, the brand focused on increasing exclusivity by
adding more luxurious interiors and sportier styling. Winterkorn
also fought to regain ground in the U.S., where sudden-
acceleration incidents in the 1980s wiped out demand.  Audi’s U.S. deliveries plunged 83 percent by 1991 from
their peak in 1985 of around 75,000 vehicles following recalls
of the German automaker’s 5000 sedan. Audi plans for the first
time this year to deliver 100,000 cars in the U.S.  Audi has been closing the U.S. pricing gap with Mercedes
and BMW helped by sales of sports cars and demand for the Q5 and
Q7 sport-utility vehicles. Audi’s average  selling price  in the
country has risen 15 percent since 2002, compared with an 11
percent gain at BMW and 7 percent increase at Mercedes,
according to Edmunds.com analysis.  Trending Upward  “Audi transaction prices are trending upward and closing
the gap on competitors,” Edmunds.com analyst Ivan Drury said.
“Audi will need to sell more of their higher-end vehicles in
order to increase overall selling prices.”  In Germany, Audi’s average base selling price for the
flagship A8 sedan has risen 6.8 percent since 2006 to 74,381
euros, outpacing  Mercedes’  top-of-the-line S-Class which has
gained 5.3 percent to 75,113 euros, according JATO Dynamics
GmbH, an auto industry research firm in Germany. The price for
BMW’s 7-Series has risen 12 percent to 70,896 euros.  The R8 GT, Audi’s most expensive serial production car,
surges to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in 3.6 seconds and
has a top speed of 320 kilometers per hour, Reil said. The R8 GT
and VW’s Lamborghini Gallardo use the same engine block, which
is built at Audi’s factory in Gyor, Hungary.  “The R8 GT is a near-supercar with the DNA of a
Lamborghini,” said  Jim Hall , principal of consulting firm 2953
Analytics in Birmingham, Michigan.  Lamborghini Cooperation  Audi works closely with Lamborghini, which VW bought in
1998, making the car body for the Italian manufacturer’s
Gallardo. The R8 GT won’t steal customers from the Gallardo
because they appeal for different reasons, Reil said.  “The Gallardo is so much more radical, ” the executive
said. “The R8 GT, however, might be used for everyday
purposes.”  Luxury carmakers have seen demand rebound this year with
the global economic recovery. BMW and Daimler have raised
earnings forecasts on booming sales in China and a recovery in
the U.S.  Porsche SE , which is merging with VW, this week said
its most expensive serial model ever, the 237,580-euro 911 GT2
RS, is sold out.  Audi is considering whether to build a five-cylinder,
Quattro concept car shown at the Paris Motor Show last month,
spokesman  Eric Felber  said, adding that the carmaker is awaiting
feedback from potential buyers.  “We’ve been looking at a distinct increase in orders, our
production has clearly picked up,” Reil said. “It’s fair to
say that the segment for super sports cars has overcome the
crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
