Standard Bank Group Ltd. , Africa’s
biggest lender, said “normalized headline earnings” totaled
8.93 billion rand ($1.29 billion) in the nine months through
September.  Cash flow was 946 million rand and net income was 8.48
billion rand, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
to the Stock Exchange News Service today. The trading update was
provided in order to allow  Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. , which owns 20 percent of Standard Bank, to “equity
account” for the group’s results, Standard added.  Comparable profit figures for the same period last year
were not provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
