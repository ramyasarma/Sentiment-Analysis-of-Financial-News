HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , a
Brazilian oil and gas exploration company, is raising as much as
2.62 billion reais ($1.54 billion) in an initial public offering
to finance oil exploration in Brazil’s Amazon and offshore
Southern Africa.  HRT sold 2.18 million common shares for 1,200 reais each,
according to a regulatory filing today. The company had planned
to raise as much as 2.95 billion reais in the sale, which
included an overallotment and some stock sold in a secondary
offering, according to the prospectus.  HRT  is selling stock to finance the exploration and
development of fields in Brazil’s Solimoes Basin and offshore
Namibia. The company said it plans to invest $1.97 billion in
Brazil and $342 million in Africa through 2014, tapping a team
of former  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  officials as to boost its
reserves.  “What you’re betting on is exploration over the next two
to three years,”  Eric Conrads , who helps manage about $1
billion in emerging market funds at ING Investment Management in
New York, said yesterday in an interview. “They have big
acreage and very nice properties.”  The HRT offer comes as oil companies in Brazil sell shares
and seek partners to cover exploration costs. State-controlled
 Petrobras  raised $70 billion last month in the world’s largest
share sale, while  Repsol YPF SA  sold 40 percent of its Brazil
unit this month to China Petroleum Corp. for $7.1 billion.  DeGoyler & MacNaughton, an oil auditing firm, calculated
HRT’s potential reserves at 1.5 billion barrels of oil and
equivalents in an August study, HRT said in its share sale
prospectus. HRT raised $479 million in late 2009 in two private
share offerings to finance the purchase of exploration acreage.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
