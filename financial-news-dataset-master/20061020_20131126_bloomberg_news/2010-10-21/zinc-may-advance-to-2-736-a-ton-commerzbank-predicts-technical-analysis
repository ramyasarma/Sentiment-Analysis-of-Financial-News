Zinc may climb to $2,736 a metric
ton after advancing above a resistance line and other key
levels, according to technical analysis by Commerzbank AG,
implying a 9.9 percent gain from the current price.  The attached chart shows the metal rose above a resistance
line drawn from December 2006 and the 200-week moving average.
The second chart shows prices gained above the 38.2 percent
retracement of the 2006-2008 decline, one of the levels singled
out in so-called Fibonacci analysis, and may advance to the
April high of $2,550 and then to the January peak of $2,736.  “Zinc has maintained upside pressure following the break
above the four-year resistance line and the 200-week moving
average,”  Axel Rudolph , a technical strategist at Commerzbank
in London, said today in a report. The metal is “thus poised on
reaching the $2,550 area,” and $2,736 “also remains in view,”
he said.  Zinc for  three-month delivery  rose $49, or 2 percent, to
$2,489 a ton at 11:33 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange. The
metal, used to rust-proof steel, has slipped 2.8 percent this
year, the only drop among the LME’s six main industrial metals.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
