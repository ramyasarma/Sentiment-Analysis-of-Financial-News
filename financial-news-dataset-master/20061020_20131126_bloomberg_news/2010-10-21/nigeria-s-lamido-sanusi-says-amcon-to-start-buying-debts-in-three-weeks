Nigerian central bank Governor
Lamido Sanusi said Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, a state-
owned company known as Amcon, will start buying bad loans from
the country’s lenders within three weeks.  Five or six of the lenders bailed out the central bank last
year “should be able to announce exclusive talks with
partners” soon, he said today from the capital, Abuja, on CNBC
Africa television. “In a few weeks we should start seeing
cautionary announcements.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
