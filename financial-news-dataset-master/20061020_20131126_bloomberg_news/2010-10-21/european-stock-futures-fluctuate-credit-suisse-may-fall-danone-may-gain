European stocks climbed, driving the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index to its highest close in six months, after
results from  Nokia Oyj  to Danone and Fiat SpA topped estimates.  Nokia rallied the most since January as the world’s biggest
maker of mobile phones also raised its industry forecasts.
Danone climbed 4.8 percent after third-quarter sales jumped 15
percent. Fiat SpA surged 4.4 as the automaker also raised its
2010 predictions.  Credit Suisse Group AG  limited gains on the
benchmark  Stoxx 600  after the second-largest Swiss bank posted
profit and trading revenue that missed analysts’ projections.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.6 percent to 267.62 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, its highest level since April 26. The gauge has
climbed 3 percent this month amid speculation that slowing
economic growth will prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to announce
another round of asset purchases at its November meeting to
bolster the economic recovery.  “Generally the numbers are surprising positively and are
being taken well by the market,” said London-based  Andrea Williams , who helps manage about $1.1 billion at Royal London
Asset Management. “We are seeing a split between relative
sectors; those companies that are cautiously optimistic are
being punished.”  Beaten Estimates  Of the 35 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have announced
results since Oct. 7, 26 have beaten  analyst estimates  for per-
share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the
U.S., 97 of the 113 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies that
have announced results this earnings season have topped
predictions,  the data  show.  National benchmark indexes increased in 14 of the 18
western European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index gained
0.5 percent and Germany’s DAX Index rose 1.3 percent. France’s
CAC 40 Index also climbed 1.3 percent.  Nokia jumped 6.3 percent to 8.21 euros after third-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates and the mobile phone maker
announced 1,800 job cuts globally.  In the first results since naming  Stephen Elop  chief
executive officer, Nokia reported net income of 529 million
euros ($740 million) and sales of 10.3 billion euros. Analysts
predicted profit of 182.5 million euros on sales of 9.99 billion
euros, according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Danone, Fiat  Danone  rose 4.8 percent to 45.46 euros. The world’s biggest
yogurt maker reported a 15 percent jump in third-quarter sales
to 4.35 billion euros ($6 billion) as it sold more Activia
yogurt and Aqua water in markets such as the U.S. and Indonesia.
That beat the 4.24 billion-euro median of analysts’ estimates.  Fiat  climbed 4.4 percent to 12.24 euros as the Italian
automaker raised its 2010 earnings forecasts to at least 2
billion euros, up from a previous prediction of 1.2 billion
euros. The company posted quarterly profit of 170 million euros
beating analysts’ estimates on sales of Iveco trucks and Case
New Holland tractors.  Pernod-Ricard  rallied 6.3 percent to 65.45 euros after the
maker of Absolut vodka said first-quarter sales growth beat
estimates, driven by demand in emerging markets.  So-called organic sales, which exclude the effect of
acquisitions or disposals and currency swings, advanced 10
percent in the three months to Sept. 30. That was more than
double the 4.5 percent median growth estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Britvic, Swedbank  Britvic Plc  climbed 5.7 percent to 497.3 pence after the
maker of Tango soda and Robinson’s fruit drinks reported a 33
percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue and announced plans
to restructure its Irish operations.  In Stockholm, Swedbank AB rallied 5.6 percent to 98.55
kronor after the largest lender in the Baltic countries posted a
profit of 2.59 billion kronor ($389 million) in the third
quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of 1.52 billion
kronor. Loan losses narrowed to 120 million kronor from 6.12
billion kronor.  Konecranes Oyj jumped 6.3 percent to 29.78 euros in
Helsinki after the world’s biggest supplier of industrial cranes
reported third-quarter net income of 23.1 million euros, beating
analysts’ estimates.  Credit Suisse  fell 4.5 percent to 41.41 Swiss francs after
Switzerland’s second-largest bank reported a 74 percent decline
in third-quarter profit to 609 million francs ($630 million) as
lower client activity curbed trading revenue. Earnings missed
the 861 million-franc median  estimate  of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Trading revenue slumped 41 percent to 2.54 billion francs,
also missing analysts’ forecast for about 3 billion francs.  Flu Vaccines  GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the U.K.’s largest drugmaker, fell 1.3
percent to 1,275 pence. The company said third-quarter profit
showed little change, held back by one-time costs tied to the
Avandia diabetes treatment and a drop in demand for pandemic flu
vaccines.  Actelion Ltd.  lost 6.2 percent to 48.79 francs after Chief
Executive Officer  Jean-Paul Clozel  said the drugmaker’s “future
is to remain independent.” The shares have soared 32 percent
this month amid takeover speculation.  The company, which today reported a 3 percent decline in
net income to 105.3 million francs, also said non-GAAP operating
profit is likely to be below this year’s level.  TUI Travel Plc  sank 11 percent to 205 pence, the biggest
drop in the Stoxx 600, after Europe’s largest tour operator
restated figures for the 2009 fiscal year and agreed to the
departure of Chief Financial Officer  Paul Bowtell .  To contact the reporter on this story:
