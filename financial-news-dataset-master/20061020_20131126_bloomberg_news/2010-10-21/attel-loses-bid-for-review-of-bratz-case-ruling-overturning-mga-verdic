Mattel Inc. lost a bid for review of
a federal appeals court ruling that the company must retry its
claims to MGA Entertainment Inc.’s Bratz dolls.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco denied Mattel’s
petition for rehearing and review by a larger panel of judges,
according to a filing today.  In July, a three-member appeals panel overturned a December
2008 order that gave Mattel rights to most of MGA’s Bratz
products. A jury in the case found that the designer who created
the dolls was working at Mattel when he conceived of the idea
and the name and made the initial drawings for the pouty and
multiethnic dolls.  The case is MGA Entertainment Inc. v. Mattel Inc.,
09-55673, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San
Francisco). The district court case is Bryant v. Mattel,
04-09049, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
