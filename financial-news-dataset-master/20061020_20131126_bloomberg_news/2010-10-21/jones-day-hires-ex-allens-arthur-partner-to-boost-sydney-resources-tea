Jones Day , a U.S.-based law firm,
boosted its energy and resources advising team in Sydney with
the addition of former  Allens Arthur Robinson  partner  Tony Wassaf  in anticipation of more acquisitions in the sector.  Wassaf, with more than 25 years of experience in the field,
has for the past 10 years been a director of Ampla Ltd., a non-
profit association for lawyers in the resources and petroleum
industry sectors, and is its immediate past president, Jones Day
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Foreign law firms are boosting employees in Australia as
energy and resources fuel the country’s economy, with Western
Australia producing a fifth of the world’s iron ore, 7 percent
of its liquified natural gas and 6 percent of its gold, which
before this week rose to a record 16 times this month. Allen &
Overy LLP, the U.K.’s fourth-biggest firm, added 17 partners in
Australia in February to target mining and natural resources.  “Tony’s a very well known figure in mining,”  Chris Ahern ,
Jones Day’s partner in charge of the Sydney office, said in a
phone interview today. The resources sector “is a very
significant part of the Australian economy.”  Wassaf will become the 25th lawyer in Jones Day’s Sydney
office, Ahern said. The Cleveland-based firm has more than 2,500
lawyers worldwide, including more than 400 in Europe and 200 in
Asia, according to Jones Day’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
