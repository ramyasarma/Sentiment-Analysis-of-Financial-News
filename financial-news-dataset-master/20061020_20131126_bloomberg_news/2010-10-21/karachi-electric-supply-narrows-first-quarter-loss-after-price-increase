Karachi Electric Supply Co. , the
supplier of power to Pakistan’s largest city, narrowed its
first-quarter loss after higher prices increased revenue.  The utility’s loss in the three months ended Sept. 30 was
1.8 billion rupees ($21 million), or 0.09 rupee a share,
compared with 5.6 billion rupees, or 0.43 rupee, a year earlier,
Karachi Electric said in a statement to the  stock exchange 
today. Revenue climbed to 22.94 billion rupees from 18.1 billion
rupees.  “Power tariffs rose around 25 percent over last year and
that supported the revenue increase,” said  Muhammad Imran , head
of research at Arif Habib Ltd. in Karachi. Prices may be
increased by about 33 percent this financial year, helping the
company to reduce losses, he said.  Demand for energy in Pakistan exceeds supply by three times
and daily electricity outages have forced textile and
engineering factories to close and caused riots across the
country. Karachi Electric needs to add plants, replace decrepit
cables and cut power theft to end blackouts that hit as much as
67 percent of the city’s population.  The utility’s shares, which have  fallen  21 percent this
year,  rose  3.3 percent to 2.17 rupees as of 10:10 a.m. local
time on the Karachi Stock Exchange.  The company’s loss in the year ended June 30 narrowed to
14.6 billion rupees from 15.5 billion rupees a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
