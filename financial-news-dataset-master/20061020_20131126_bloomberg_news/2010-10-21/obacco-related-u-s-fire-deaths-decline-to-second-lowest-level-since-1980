The number of U.S. deaths from fires
caused by lighted tobacco products fell to the second-lowest
since 1980 as more states mandated that cigarettes have safety
protection, and fewer people smoked, a safety group said.  Fires caused by smoking killed 680 U.S. people in 2008,
compared with 720 in 2007, according to a  statement  today from
the National Fire Protection Association. The figures exclude
firefighter fatalities. The blazes caused 1,520 injuries and
$737 billion in property damage in 2008, the group said. The low
was  640 deaths  in 2002.  Fires from smoking products have declined 66 percent since
1980. By February, all 50 states had passed bills that require
cigarettes with a lower propensity for burning when left
unattended, the association said. New York was the first state
to pass such a law, in 2003, according to the NFPA. Smokers can
reduce risk by going outside to light up and abstaining when
they’re tired or intoxicated, the group said.  “To prevent a cigarette fire, you have to be alert,” the
NFPA said. “You won’t be if you’re sleepy, have been drinking,
or have taken medicine or other drugs.”  The percentage of U.S. adults 18 years and older who were
smokers totaled 20.6 percent in 2009, down from 24.7 percent in
1997, according to the  website  of the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
