             Turkey ’s energy regulator may
reconsider a price ceiling it imposes on gasoline after  oil
companies  including  OAO Lukoil (LKOH)  said they may halt investments in
the industry.  
 Officials of the regulator will meet with industry leaders
tomorrow to discuss pricing policy, Nafiz Kaya, spokesman for
the Ankara-based body, said in a telephone interview today. The
regulator’s board could meet before the weekend to reconsider
the cap, Kaya said.  
 The regulator imposed the ceiling on June 26 after
retailers refused to lower prices. The cap is adjusted every
three days and today stands at 3.28 liras ($2.21) for a liter of
gasoline, according to the regulator’s  Web site .  
 The cap may also deter  OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, from buying Petrol Ofisi AS, the country’s biggest
chain of gas stations, Sabah newspaper  reported  today. Fuel
station owners demonstrated in Ankara on July 1 against the
price limits, saying the ceiling, combined with higher taxes, is
eroding profit margins.  
 OMV said on Aug. 5 it was in talks with  Dogan Sirketler
Grubu Holding AS (DOHOL)  to buy its 54 percent stake in Petrol Ofisi.
The purchase would raise OMV’s stake to 96 percent.
