             The New York Independent System
Operator, which controls the state’s power grid and market,
ordered cuts to customers that participate in demand reduction
programs as hot weather drove consumption near the record high.  
 Power demand rose to 33,450 megawatts as of 4:22 p.m., even
after the grid operator asked some commercial customers in the
city, representing about 400 megawatts, to reduce usage until 7
p.m., said  Ken Klapp , a spokesman.  
 Without those cuts from “interruptible customers” that
get a discount on electricity bills for participating, use today
may have surpassed the 33,939-megawatt record  reached  on Aug. 2,
2006. Demand on Long Island hit an all-time high.  
 Consolidated Edison Inc. , which supplies more than 3.2
million customers in New York and its suburbs, also asked
customers to conserve energy by turning off lights and
appliances as temperatures reached a record 103 degrees
Fahrenheit (39 Celsius) this afternoon.  
 More than 4,000 customers in the five New York boroughs had
lost electricity service as the hot weather strained grids, Con
Ed said on its  website . The utility expected to restore most of
them by 7 p.m.  
 $250 a Megawatt-Hour  
 Wholesale electricity in the city reached $185.94 a
megawatt-hour as demand surged, and on Long island climbed to
$250, according to the grid operator. The average price for
utilities such as Con Ed was $100.85 at 4 p.m. local time.  
 Power demand on Long Island reached a record 5,815
megawatts as of 4:30 p.m., topping the previous high of 5,792 on
Aug. 3, 2006, according to Vanessa Baird-Streeter, a spokeswoman
for the Long Island Power Authority. She said 3,700 customers
lost power because of the heat.  
 Connecticut Light & Power reported on its website that
19,382 customers were without power as of 4:05 p.m. local time.
Most of them are in Stamford, where a substation failed,
according to Mitch Gross, a company spokesman. The cause of the
outage had yet to be determined.  
 Gross said that electricity demand did not reach record
highs in the utility’s service area.
