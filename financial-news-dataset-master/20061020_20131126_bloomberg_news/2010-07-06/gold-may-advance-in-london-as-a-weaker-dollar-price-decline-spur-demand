             Gold may gain in London as a weaker
dollar spurs demand for bullion as an alternative asset and as
some investors view the metal’s drop from a record as excessive.  
 The dollar slipped to near a six-week low against the euro
as European equities climbed. Gold, which typically moves
inversely to the greenback, last week dropped to a five-week low
after trading on June 28 within 0.2 percent of a record.  
 “Everybody used to be so bearish on the euro, but it’s
turned around,” said  Jesper Dannesboe , a senior commodity
strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. “That could give a
bit of help to gold. Some people may also come in and think
gold’s had a nice correction and try to buy.”  
 Gold for immediate delivery added $1.70, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,210.97 an ounce at 11:28 a.m. in London. Bullion for August
delivery was 0.3 percent higher at $1,211.30 on the Comex in New
York.  
 The metal rose to $1,210.75 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,208 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 Bullion has climbed 10 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,265.30 an ounce on June 21, as investors sought to protect
their wealth from prolonged financial turbulence in Europe and
on concern the global recovery may slow. The metal touched
$1,196.65 on July 1, the lowest level since May 25.  
 “With gold touching its lowest close in over a month, we
see these levels as a good entry point for fresh long
positions,”  Hussein Allidina , head of commodity research at
Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report today.  
 Asian Stocks Rise  
 Service industries in the U.S. expanded in June at a slower
pace, economists said before a report today. The data will
follow reports last week that showed a slowdown in manufacturing
and weakness in housing, at the same time Europe grapples with a
debt crisis and China tries to slow its economy.  
 Europe’s  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained for the first time
in six days, ending the longest losing streak in a year. Asian
shares also rose as Australia’s central bank held interest rates
steady and said business investment is set to expand.  
 Silver for immediate delivery in London was 0.4 percent
higher at $17.8775 an ounce. Platinum was 1 percent higher at
$1,519.63 an ounce, and palladium was up 2.6 percent at $439.75
an ounce.
