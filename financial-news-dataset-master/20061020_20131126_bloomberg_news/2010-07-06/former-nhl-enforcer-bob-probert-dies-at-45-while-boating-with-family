             WINDSOR, Ontario,  July 5 (UPI) -- Bob Probert, one of the 
NHL's top "enforcers" during his 16-year career, died Monday 
after collapsing on a boat near Windsor, Ontario, authorities 
said.  
 Ontario Provincial Police spokeswoman Shana Coulter 
confirmed that Probert, 45, died Monday afternoon, The Windsor 
Star reported.  
 The newspaper said emergency responders were unable to 
revive Probert on the shores of Lake St. Clair and he was taken 
to Windsor Regional Hospital.  
 An unidentified witness told the Star: "Something 
happened, a medical emergency. He was fixing the trim or 
something, stood up and then fell down."  
 Probert, a Windsor native, played for the Detroit Red 
Wings for nine seasons starting in 1985 and with the Chicago 
Blackhawks for seven others. In his storied career, the left 
winger piled up 3,300 penalty minutes in 935 career games, 
sixth-most on the all-time penalty minutes leaders' list.  
 He was suspended in 1989 after being arrested for trying 
to smuggle cocaine across the Canada-U.S. border.
