             The Global X Brazil Consumer ETF will
begin trading in New York on July 8, said the chief executive
officer of Global X Management Company LLC, the asset manager
overseeing the exchange-traded fund.  
 The ETF will track the Solactive Brazil Consumer Index of
28 companies including  Cia de Bebidas das Americas , Latin
America’s largest brewer known as AmBev, and  JBS SA , the world’s
biggest beef producer. It will trade under the ticker symbol
BRAQ and will be listed on NYSE Arca, an electronic market
operated in New York by NYSE Euronext,  Bruno del Ama , chief
executive officer of New York-based Global X, said in a phone
interview from Los Angeles.  
 “People want to get access to the story on the ground and
to Brazil’s domestic market,” del Ama said. “The country is
seeing a lot of growth in discretionary income and people moving
into the middle class. The best way to partake in that growth is
through the consumer sector of the economy.”  
 The ETF is Brazil’s first to exclusively track the
performance of consumer companies, Global X said. Brazil’s gross
domestic product may expand 7.3 percent this year, the fastest
pace in more than two decades, the nation’s central bank said on
June 30.  
 Global X also plans to launch ETFs tracking Brazil’s
financial, industrial, raw-materials and utilities industries,
del Ama said. Exchange-traded funds issue a fixed number of
shares and trade throughout the day like stocks. Most are
designed to passively track a benchmark equity index.
