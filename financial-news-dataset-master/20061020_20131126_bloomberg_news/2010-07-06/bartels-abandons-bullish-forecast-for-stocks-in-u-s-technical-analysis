             Mary Ann Bartels , the Bank of America
Corp. analyst who had forecast the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
to rise to 1,300 this year, reversed her bullish call and said
stocks may extend their biggest decline since the rally began.  
 Bartels, ranked second among analysts who study price
charts in Institutional Investor magazine’s most recent survey,
shifted her view after the S&P 500 last week broke the February
intraday low of 1,044.50 on increased volume while its 50-day
moving average fell below the 200-day average in a so-called
“ dark cross .”  
 “The measured move upside objective of 1300-1325 is no
longer a valid target on the S&P 500 this year,” Bartels, who
is based in New York, wrote in a note to clients today. The
benchmark may sink as low as 950 and that “would fit with an
economic slowdown scenario.”  
 U.S. shares are experiencing the largest losses since the
bull market began in March 2009, when the S&P 500 index sank to
a 12-year low. The benchmark has slumped as much as 16 percent
from its 2010 high in April on concern a sovereign-debt crisis
in Europe and China’s moves to slow the world’s largest emerging
economy will curb global growth. It  closed  at 1,028.06 today,
down 0.5 percent for the session and off 7.8 percent this year.  
 Should the market fail to stay above 950, Bartels said, the
S&P 500 may retreat to as low as 869 -- the July 2009 low -- and
that would suggest “the market is discounting a potential
double dip for the U.S. economy.”  
 Investors should favor “defensive stocks,” or companies
whose earnings are less affected by economic swings, such as
utility and phone shares, she said. “Defense is the name of the
game -- even on a tactical rally,” she said.
