             SMA Solar Technology AG   surged  as
much as 23 percent in Frankfurt trading after the maker of
solar-power equipment increased 2010 sales forecasts as
Germany’s parliament proposed easing subsidy reductions.  
 The stock gained the most since Nov. 12 after SMA said
today in a statement that it expects sales to rise to 1.5
billion euros ($1.9 billion) to 1.8 billion euros this year from
a previous target of 1.1 billion to 1.3 billion euros.  
 German lawmakers late yesterday proposed easing reductions
in solar-power subsidies for three months and cleared the way
for parliament to vote on the cuts by July 9. German solar-panel
makers Q-Cells SE and SolarWorld AG also advanced today.  
 SMA Solar jumped as much as 19.50 euros to 104.20 euros and
traded at 100 euros at 10:25 a.m. local time, valuing the
Niestetal, Germany-based company at almost 3.5 billion euros. Q-
Cells  rose  as high as 5.8 percent to 5.59 euros and SolarWorld
gained as much as 4.3 percent to 10.24 euros.  
 The parliamentary proposal would change a government plan
that was set to trim subsidies for solar power fed into
Germany’s electricity grid by 16 percent for rooftop equipment,
15 percent for farmland and 11 percent for spaces such as former
industrial or military sites.  
 The reductions, which the government aimed to introduce
retroactively to July 1, would be scaled back by three
percentage points for each category until Sept. 30, when the
full cuts would kick in, according to a statement in Berlin from
parliament’s upper house, the Bundesrat.
