             The U.S. housing market “won’t come
back” for a long period, Harvard University economist Kenneth
Rogoff predicted in remarks at FinanceAsia’s Asia-Pacific 
Debt Investor Forum in Hong Kong.  
 Speaking earlier today in a Bloomberg Television interview,
Rogoff said he’s not among those predicting an increase in
American home prices, saying “they have further to go.”
