             Office vacancies in the U.S. rose to
the highest level since 1993 in the second quarter as the
sluggish economic recovery damps demand from corporate tenants,
 Reis Inc.  said in a report.  
 The vacancy rate climbed to 17.4 percent from 16 percent a
year earlier and 17.3 percent in the first quarter, the New
York-based research company said today in a statement. Effective
rents, the amount tenants actually pay landlords, fell 5.7
percent from a year earlier and 0.9 percent from the previous
three months, according to Reis.  
 Private employers made fewer hires in June than economists
had forecast, reinforcing concerns the recovery will weaken, the
Labor Department said July 2. The report capped a month of data
signaling weakness in housing and a slowdown in manufacturing.
Including government, payrolls fell for the first time this year
because of a drop in federal census workers. The  jobless rate 
declined to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent in May as the labor
force shrank.  
 “Although occupancy continues to deteriorate, the rate of
decline has clearly slowed,” said Ryan Severino, economist at
Reis, in the firm’s report. Rents may turn positive later this
year if the economy stabilizes, he said.  
 A total of 7.7 million square feet (715,000 square meters)
of office space was completed last quarter, one of the lowest
addition levels since Reis began publishing quarterly data in
1999, the firm said.  
 Office  vacancies increased in 49 of 82 cities tracked by
Reis, while effective rents fell in 60 markets. The growing
number of cities with declining rents reflects concessions
granted by landlords, Reis said.  
 Washington, D.C., remained the city with the lowest office
vacancy rate, at 10 percent, according to the firm. New York
vacancies stayed at 11.7 percent. Detroit had the highest
vacancy rate, at 26.3 percent, amid declining employment in the
auto industry, Reis said.
