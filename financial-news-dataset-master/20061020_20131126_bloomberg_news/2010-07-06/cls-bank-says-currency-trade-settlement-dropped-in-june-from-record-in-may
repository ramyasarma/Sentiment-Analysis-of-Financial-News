             (Corrects last month’s figure in first paragraph, CLS Bank
headquarters in second paragraph.)  
 CLS Bank, the operator of the largest
currency-settlement system, said daily volume fell to an average
900,000 instructions in June, from a record 1.06 million the
previous month.  
 Average daily values settled last month were unchanged from
May at $4.23 trillion, the New York-based bank said today in a
statement distributed by e-mail.
