             Gerald Ronson ’s Heron International
secured the first tenant for what will be the tallest tower in
the City of London, a person with knowledge of the agreement
said.  
 McDermott Will & Emery LLP , a Chicago-based law firm, will
occupy the eighth and ninth floors of the 46-story Heron Tower,
according to the person, who declined to be identified because
the information isn’t public. It will pay 55 pounds ($84) a
square foot for space in the skyscraper near Liverpool Street
railway station, the person said.  
 Heron Tower is one of only two prime office buildings
that’s due to be completed in London’s main financial district
next year. The lack of space coming into the market caused the
average rent for the best offices to increase by 5 percent in
the second quarter to about 50 pounds a square foot, according
to  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc .  
 The tower forms part of a 1.5 billion-pound trio of City of
London projects by London-based Heron, which includes a 36-story
residential development next to the Barbican complex. The
developer is also seeking permission for a 43-story building
next to the Heron Tower that will include a Four Seasons hotel.  
 Henry Columbine, a spokesman for Heron, declined to
comment. No one at  McDermott Will & Emery ’s London office was
immediately available to comment.
