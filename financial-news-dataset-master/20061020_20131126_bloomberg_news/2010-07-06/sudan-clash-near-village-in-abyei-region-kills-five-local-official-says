             Four Sudanese civilians and a
policeman were killed yesterday when gunmen attacked a village
in the disputed region of Abyei, the chief administrator of the
area said.  
 The attack occurred near the village of Tajalei, about 30
kilometers (19 miles) northeast of Abyei town, Chief
Administrator Deng Arop Kuol said today in a telephone
interview.  
 Abyei is due to hold a referendum in January to decide
whether to be part of Sudan’s north or south.  Southern Sudan  is
scheduled to vote at the same time to decide if it should become
an independent nation.  
 “The idea is to keep the border demarcation from taking
place, and to keep the referendum from taking place,” Kuol said,
referring to the motives behind the attack.  
 The  Permanent Court of Arbitration  in The Hague last July
gave the Ngok Dinka people, who see themselves as southerners,
control over Abyei. The Misseriya people, who back the north,
objected to the decision out of fear they won’t be able to graze
their cattle in Abyei during the dry season, especially if
Southern Sudan secedes.  
 The Misseriya fought with the north during the two-decade
civil war against southern rebels that ended in 2005.  
 Disputes between the Ngok Dinka and the Misseriya erupted
in violence in 2008, killing 89 people and displacing 90,000,
according the  United Nations .
