             Vale SA  Chief Executive Officer  Roger Agnelli  said oil projects off Brazil’s coast will create
“gigantic” demand for steel,  Folha de S. Paulo  reported.  
 Oil projects in the so-called pre-salt area of the Atlantic
Ocean will need steel for pipelines, tankers and platforms,
Agnelli told the newspaper in an interview.  
 Vale will focus investments in mining to supply iron ore to
steelmakers in Brazil and abroad, Agnelli said, according to
Folha.
