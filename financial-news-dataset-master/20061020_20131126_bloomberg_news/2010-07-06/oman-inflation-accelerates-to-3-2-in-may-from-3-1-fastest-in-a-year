             Inflation in Oman accelerated to 3.2
percent in May, the fastest pace in a year, from 3.1 percent in
the previous month.  
 Consumer prices rose 0.2 percent on the month, according to
data posted today on the Ministry of Economy’s  website .  
 Annual inflation may accelerate to between 4 percent and 5
percent this year, driven by an increase in global food costs
and higher demand, especially for building materials, Central
Bank Governor Hamud bin Sangur al-Zadjali said on April 7.
Inflation was 2 percent last year. The Omani rial is pegged to
the dollar.  
 Consumer prices have also started to pick up in Saudi
Arabia, the largest Arab economy. Inflation in the kingdom
accelerated to 5.4 percent in May as the cost of fuel, housing
and goods and services rose.
