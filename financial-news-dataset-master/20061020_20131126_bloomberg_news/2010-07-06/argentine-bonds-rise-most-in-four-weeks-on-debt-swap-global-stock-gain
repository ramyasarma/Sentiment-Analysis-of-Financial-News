             Argentine bonds rose the most in
almost four weeks as gains in global stocks and the higher level
of acceptance of the government’s debt swap plan fueled demand
for the country’s higher-yielding securities.  
 The yield on the country’s dollar bonds due in 2015 fell 46
basis points, or 0.46 percentage point, to 12.55 percent at 4:48
p.m. New York time, according to Deutsche Bank. It is the
biggest decline since June 10. The price rose 1.5 cents to 81
cents on the dollar, after falling 0.15 cents yesterday.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.5 percent to
1,028.06. U.S. stocks rose from a 10-month low, rebounding from
a 5 percent drop for the S&P 500 last week, which took the gauge
to its cheapest valuation since March 2009.  
 “Global stocks are up, so Argentine markets are going to
replicate that,” said  Jeffrey Grills , an emerging markets debt
portfolio manager who helps oversee more than $2.6 billion worth
of assets at Greenwich, Connecticut-based fund Gramercy.
“Another positive is that acceptance for the debt swap was
higher than expected.”  
 Creditors holding about $12.9 billion worth of defaulted
Argentine bonds, or 70 percent of a total outstanding $18.3
billion, tendered their securities in a debt exchange, the
Economy Ministry said in a press release last night. This is up
from the $12.1 billion announced on June 23.  
 Argentina’s peso fell 0.2 percent to 3.9359 per U.S.
dollar, from 3.9295 yesterday.
