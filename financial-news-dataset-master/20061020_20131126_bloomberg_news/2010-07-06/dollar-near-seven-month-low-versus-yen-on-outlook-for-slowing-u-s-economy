             The dollar traded near a seven-month
low against the yen on speculation a Federal Reserve official
speaking today will stress the need to keep interest rates near
zero amid signs the U.S. recovery is slowing,  
 The U.S. currency was close to a six-week low against the
euro before Minneapolis Fed President  Narayana Kocherlakota 
speaks on monetary policy and regulation in Montreal today and
after a U.S. report yesterday showed service industries expanded
at a slower pace than economists forecast. Australia’s dollar
traded near a one-week high against the greenback amid signs its
economy is weathering the effects of Europe’s debt crisis and
waning demand from China.  
 “There is a sense the U.S. economy is slowing,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in Sydney at ICAP Australia Ltd., a
unit of the world’s largest interdealer broker. “The sentiment
is utterly toxic. The way the market seems to be working at the
moment is the euro and the yen are the new safe haven and the
dollar is losing a little bit of its luster.”  
 The dollar traded at 87.62 yen as of 9:12 a.m. in Tokyo
from 87.52 yen in New York yesterday, after falling to 86.97 on
July 1, the lowest level since Dec. 2. The U.S. currency was at
$1.2615 per euro from $1.2626 yesterday, when it dropped to
$1.2662, the weakest since May 21. The yen bought 110.46 per
euro from 110.51.  
 Australia’s dollar was at 85.10 U.S. cents from 85.27 cents
yesterday, when it climbed to 85.60 cents, the highest since
June 30. The currency traded at 74.55 yen from 74.62 yen.  
 Rate Outlook  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange show a 34 percent
chance the Fed will keep its benchmark rate between zero and
0.25 percent through its April 2011 meeting, compared with 18
percent odds a month earlier.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses, which make up about 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 53.8 in June from 55.4 the previous month. The
June figure was less than the median forecast of 55 in a
Bloomberg News survey. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  
 An Australian report tomorrow will show the nation added
jobs for a fourth month, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
The Reserve Bank of Australia said in its policy statement
yesterday consumer spending and business investment are growing.  
 “The RBA held the line on its global and domestic growth
outlooks, seeing both at around trend,”  John Kyriakopoulos ,
Sydney-based head of currency strategy at National Australia
Bank Ltd., wrote in a note today. “We continue to see the next
move by the RBA as being a hike in November, which will support
a rebound in the Australian dollar in the fourth quarter.”  
 The number of Australian people employed rose by 15,000 in
June after increasing 26,900 in May, according to a Bloomberg
survey before the statistics bureau report. The jobless rate
held at 5.2 percent last month, another Bloomberg survey showed.  
 RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board left the overnight
cash rate target at 4.5 percent for a second month yesterday.
