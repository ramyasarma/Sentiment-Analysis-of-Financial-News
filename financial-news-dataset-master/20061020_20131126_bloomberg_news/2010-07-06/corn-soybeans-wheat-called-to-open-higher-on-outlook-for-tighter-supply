             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that a July
9 government report will show rising demand and reduced
inventories, said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst for Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 3 cent to 5 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on speculation that too much rain in the Midwest and
hot, dry conditions in China may damage crops in the two biggest
consuming nations, Henderson said. Soybean-meal futures may open
$1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to
rise 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound, he said.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as hot, dry weather hurts production in Russia,
Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, Henderson said.
