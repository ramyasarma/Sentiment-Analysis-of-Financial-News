             The cost of insuring sovereign debt
against default climbed 30 percent on average last quarter amid
Europe’s escalating fiscal crisis, according to CMA DataVision.  
 Credit-default swaps on 93 percent of the 70 governments
tracked by CMA rose, with Greece temporarily overtaking
Venezuela as the country with the world’s highest bond risk, the
CME Group Inc. unit said in a report published today.  
 “The major widening action in European sovereign credits
indicates that the eurozone remains the hub and focus of the
global debt crisis,” according to CMA’s Global Sovereign Credit
Risk report. “None of the Western European sovereign credit-
default swaps tightened.”  
 European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  this
week urged governments to trim deficits to improve consumer and
investor confidence. The European Union in May hammered out a
750 billion euro ($939 billion) rescue package to help ease a
regional debt crisis sparked by Greece’s budget deficit.  
 Protection costs for the quarter’s worst European
performers more than doubled, with swaps on Greece soaring 190
percent, Belgium climbing 168 percent, Spain 129 percent and
Portugal 127 percent, the report said.  
 Credit-default swaps are contracts for protecting bonds
against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 Korean Tensions  
 Swaps on South Korea climbed 65 percent as tensions with
neighboring North Korea mounted when a warship sank, making it
Asia’s worst-performing sovereign. With a 2 percent increase
Vietnam was Asia’s best performer.  
 The cost of insuring Australia’s debt increased 52 percent
after a new mining tax was levied on resource companies.  
 The U.S. was one of eight nations whose default swaps
showed improvement in the quarter, falling 2.4 percent,
according to CMA. U.K. credit-default swaps were little changed
as the country’s new coalition government announced a reduction
in the “scale of state spending and tax increases to help bring
public debt under control,” the report said.  
 Norway, Finland, the U.S., Denmark and Sweden have the
lowest probability of sovereign default, according to the swaps
market. Venezuela, Greece, Argentina, Pakistan and Ukraine are
the riskiest states.
