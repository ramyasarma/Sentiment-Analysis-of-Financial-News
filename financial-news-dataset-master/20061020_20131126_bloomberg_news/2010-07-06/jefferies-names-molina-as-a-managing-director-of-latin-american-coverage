             Jefferies Group Inc. , the securities
firm that increased its  head count  by more than 25 percent since
2008, hired  Rodolfo L. Molina  to lead its investment-banking
business in Latin America.  
 Molina joined from UBS AG, where he was a managing director
in the Latin America investment-banking group for six years, New
York-based Jefferies said today in a statement.  
 Jefferies reported $256 million in  investment-banking 
revenue for the second quarter, a record for the firm and more
than double the $120.8 million from a year earlier. The company
has increased its  head count  to 2,821 from 2,241 in 2008, taking
advantage of the collapse of larger investment banks.  
 “Latin America is a major focal point of the geographic
expansion of our investment-banking and capital-markets
business,”  Benjamin Lorello , global head of investment banking,
said in the statement. “Rodolfo will be working closely with me
and other members of Jefferies’ management across the firm to
build-out our presence in this vitally important region.”
