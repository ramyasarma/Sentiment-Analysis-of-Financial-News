             First National Bank is in a dispute 
with Stadium Management South Africa over the rights to name 
Soccer City, the stadium that will be used to host the final of
the soccer World Cup, Business Report said, citing spokespeople
from both companies.  
 Stadium Management says there is no relationship with the 
bank, owned by FirstRand Ltd., and it plans to name the venue 
the National Sports Stadium after the World Cup ends, the 
Johannesburg-based newspaper reported. FNB says it has the 
rights to name the stadium until 2014.
