             Hopewell Highway Infrastructure Ltd. ,
controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Gordon Wu , is marketing 
its yuan bonds with a coupon of about 3 percent, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  
 The company is meeting with investors to sell at least 1
billion yuan ($148 million) of bonds, and will wrap up talks
tomorrow, said the person, who declined to be identified as the
information is private. The notes would be the first in China’s
currency by a non-bank Hong Kong company.  
 The operator of expressways in China’s Pearl River Delta
region said in a June 27 statement that it would sell yuan bonds
to Hong Kong institutional investors with help from Bank of
China Ltd.’s local unit. Hopewell may offer two-year notes.  
 China, the world’s third-largest economy, wants to promote
the yuan beyond its borders and increase its use in trade.
The use of yuan for cross-border trade settlement has been
expanded to 20 provinces and cities, the People’s Bank of China
 said June 22 .
