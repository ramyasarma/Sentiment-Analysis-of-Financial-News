             German and French government bonds
declined as yields near record lows and gains in equities sapped
demand for the perceived safety of fixed-income assets.  
 The losses pushed the 10-year bund yield up from within
five basis points of an all-time low.  The MSCI World Index  of
stocks climbed 2.2 percent, its biggest gain in three weeks.
Spanish debt fell as banks sold 6 billion euros ($7.5 billion)
of the nation’s securities, helping boost Spain’s stock market
on optimism that the country can plug its budget shortfall.  
 “Bunds are going to be very much dictated by what equity
markets do,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “There’s a reasonable
amount of liquidity around and that money needs to be put to
work. It can’t just sit around” in the safest debt, he said.  
 The 10-year German yield increased five basis points to
2.59 percent as of 5 p.m. in London. The 3 percent security due
July 2020 fell 0.43, or 4.3 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
103.53. The yield dropped to 2.5 percent on June 8, the lowest
since Bloomberg started collecting the data in 1989. The French
10-year yield increased four basis points to 2.96 percent. It
fell to 2.83 percent in May.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  snapped five days of losses, the
longest losing streak in a year, surging 2.6 percent.  
 Austria sold 1.32 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2015
and 2020, before a German auction of as much as 5 billion euros
of 10-year debt tomorrow.  
 Bund Rally  
 German government bonds rallied this year as investors
switched from peripheral euro-region countries, including Greece
and Spain, amid speculation that swelling budget deficits may
spur defaults. Investors also bought bunds on speculation the
recovery from the worst global financial crisis since World War
II would sputter as governments pared spending.  
 Traders are also betting that signs the economic recovery
is floundering will prompt the European Central Bank to keep
interest rates at a record low for longer. Policy makers will
leave the refinancing rate at 1 percent in two days’ time,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  
 German bonds have returned 7.2 percent in 2010, compared
with 5.9 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Greek debt has lost investors 18 percent,
with Spanish securities down 2.4 percent, the indexes show.  
 Spain’s 10-year bond yield rose eight basis points to 4.71
percent. That left the extra yield investors demand to hold 10-
year Spanish debt over  benchmark  German bunds at 209 basis
points, according to Bloomberg generic prices. The spread
reached a 14-year high of 221 basis points on June 16.  
 Spanish Sale  
 Spain’s planned issue of 10-year bonds in euros was priced
to yield 195 basis points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate,
according to a banker involved in today’s deal. It’s the
nation’s first syndicated bond issue since February.  
 The cost of insuring Spain’s debt fell after the sale.
Credit-default swaps on the nation dropped 10.5 basis points to
254.5, compared with a record-high closing price of 274.5 on May
6, according to CMA DataVision. The nation’s borrowing costs
increased at an auction of five-year notes last week, after its
top credit ranking was placed on review for a possible downgrade
by Moody’s Investors Service.  
 Austria sold 770 million euros of bonds maturing July 2020
at a yield of 3 percent, down from 3.5 percent at an auction in
March. It also sold 550 million euros of securities due 2015,
priced to yield 1.9 percent. The country’s 3.9 percent
securities due July 2020 fell, with the yield rising two basis
points to 3.05 percent.
