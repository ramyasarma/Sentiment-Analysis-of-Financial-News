             Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
recommended selling the pound versus the yen because U.K.
economic growth may slow, forcing policy makers to retain
“loose” monetary policy as the government cuts spending.  
 Investors should aim for an 8 percent decline of the pound
against the yen to 123,  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist in
London, said today in a research report.  
 Sterling rose 0.5 percent to 133.46 yen as of 9:48 a.m. in
London.
