             Baosteel Group Corp., China’s second
largest steelmaker, said the market has turned weaker.  
 The company wants to maintain the proportion of exports to
annual production at 10 percent, Vice Chairman Liu Guosheng told
reporters at a conference in Shanghai today. There’s a bigger
focus on environmental protection, he also said.
