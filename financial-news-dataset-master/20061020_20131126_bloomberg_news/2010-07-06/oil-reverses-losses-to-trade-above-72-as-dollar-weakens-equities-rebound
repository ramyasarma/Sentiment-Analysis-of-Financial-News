             Crude oil reversed losses to trade
five cents higher at $72.19 a barrel in electronic trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:32 p.m. in Singapore.  
 Oil recovered from a decline of as much as 1.5 percent as
the dollar weakened and Asian equities rebounded from a one-
month low as investors took the view valuations were attractive.
