             The winner of this month’s British
Open at St. Andrews will receive 850,000 pounds ($1.3 million)
after officials increased prize money for the first time in
three years.  
 The prize fund for golf’s oldest major championship will be
4.8 million pounds, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club said in a
statement. It was 4.2 million the past three championships, with
the winner receiving 750,000 pounds.  
 “The Open Championship sits at the forefront of world golf
and it is appropriate that our prize fund reflects that position
in the game,” R&A Chief Executive  Peter Dawson  said. “Over the
last 18 months we have had to take account of the pound’s
weakened position against the U.S. dollar and euro and we have
increased our prize money accordingly.”  
 Since mid-2007, the pound has declined about 25 percent
against the dollar and 19 percent against the euro.  
 The  150th Anniversary Open Championship  will be played July
15 to 18 at St. Andrews in Scotland.  Stewart Cink  of the U.S. is
the defending champion.
