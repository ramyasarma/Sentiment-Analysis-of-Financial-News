             China’s stocks  will be “range-
bound” because a shift to increased reliance on consumption to
drive economic growth will benefit companies that have a “very
marginal index weighting,” Credit Suisse Group AG said.  
 “The big cap China stocks, like commodities, banks and
property, are not key beneficiaries of the new consumption
driven model,” Credit Suisse analysts  Vincent Chan  and Peggy Chan  said in a report. “On the other hand, the key
beneficiaries have a very marginal index  weighting . We will not
have a meaningful bull market for China until we see more
concrete results of this structural change.”
