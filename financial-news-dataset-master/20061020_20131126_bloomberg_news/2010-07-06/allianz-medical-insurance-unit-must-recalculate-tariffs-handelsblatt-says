             Allianz SE ’s German health insurance
unit has stopped selling new business “to a large extent” as
it needs to recalculate some tariffs after a ruling by the
German federal administrative court,  Handelsblatt  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 The court ruled that the health insurance unit can’t demand
a surcharge from existing customers if they wanted to switch to
a tariff designed for new customers, the newspaper said.  
 Allianz declined to comment, Handelsblatt said.
