             U.K. stocks climbed, with the FTSE
100 Index posting its biggest advance in five weeks, on
speculation a decline since April may be overdone given the
outlook for the global economy.  
 Kazakhmys Plc and Xstrata Plc surged at least 6 percent as
metals prices increased. BP Plc gained 3.7 percent as the
Financial Times reported that the oil company doesn’t plan to
sell new shares and analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
advised buying the stock.  
 The  FTSE 100  surged 141.47, or 2.9 percent, to 4,965, the
biggest gain since May 27. The FTSE 100 tumbled 17 percent from
its high this year on April 15 through yesterday as a sovereign-
debt crisis in Europe and disappointing economic reports in the
U.S. and China fanned concern a global economic recovery is
faltering. The  FTSE All-Share Index  rallied 2.8 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Overall Index advanced 3 percent.  
 “All the bad news is priced into the market,” said Ian
 Murrell , head of research at London-based Pritchard
Stockbrokers. “There’s a bit of bargain hunting around. The
miners are the best sector to catch the market bounce.”  
 Kazakhmys, a producer of copper in Central Asia, added 7.2
percent to 1,037 pence. Xstrata, the largest exporter of coal
for power stations, jumped 6.4 percent to 905.8 pence. Copper,
aluminum and nickel were among commodities that rose on the
London Metal Exchange.  
 BP Climbs  
 BP increased 3.7 percent to 345.5 pence. The oil company is
not planning to issue new shares to strategic investors amid
pressure on its finances caused by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill,
the Financial Times reported, citing an unidentified official.  
 Separately, analysts at RBS raised their  recommendation  on
the shares to “buy” from “hold,” saying the stock already
reflects the worse possible scenario for the company’s leaking
well. The shares, which have dropped 45 percent in 2010, may
climb to 455 pence, the analysts wrote in a report today.  
 Tullow Oil Plc, the U.K. explorer with the most licenses in
Africa, climbed 4 percent to 1,083 pence as the company said the
Ugandan government gave conditional approval to its delayed
purchase of assets from Heritage Oil Plc. Heritage rose to 9.5
percent to 414 pence after selling the assets.  
 Barclays Plc rose 5.9 percent to 274.6 pence. The U.K.’s
third-biggest bank should evaluate a spinoff of its investment
banking and wealth management units, according to a report today
from Mediobanca Securities.  
 Debenhams Plc , the U.K.’s second-largest department-store
company, advanced 5 percent to 60.05 pence, rising for a fourth
day. UBS AG upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral,”
calling the shares “cheap, cheap, cheap.”  
 The retailer’s third quarter is “likely to be the low
point and we expect management to increase focus on delivering
market share gains and positive like-for-like” sales, the
brokerage wrote in a report.  
 The following stocks were also active in London trading
today. Stock symbols are in parentheses:  
 African Barrick Gold Ltd.  (ABG LN), a U.K. based company
that operates mines in Tanzania, dropped 16.5 pence, or 2.8
percent, to 584 pence. Gold tumbled 1.1 percent in New York to
$1195.75 an ounce as demand waned following the metal’s rally to
a record last month.  
 Balfour Beatty Plc  (BBY LN) jumped 6.5 pence, or 2.8
percent, to 243.1 pence. The U.K.’s largest builder expects its
order book to be ahead of the 14.1 billion pounds ($21 billion)
reported in December even as it sees “uncertainties” in some
parts of its markets.  
 PartyGaming Plc  (PRTY LN) rose 10.7 pence, or 4.9 percent,
to 231.5 pence. The online gambling company said overall trading
in the second quarter was in line with its forecasts.  
 Spice Plc  (SPI LN) climbed 3.5 pence, or 6.5 percent, to
57.5 pence.  Simon Rigby , founder and former chief executive
officer of the U.K.’s biggest reader of water meters, said that
a revised offer from Cinven Ltd. for the company is “a good
increase” and should be considered by the board.  
 The board of Spice said today the proposal of 62 to 65
pence a share “undervalues” the company and it hasn’t entered
into talks with Cinven.  
      Spirax-Sarco Engineering Plc  (SPX LN) rose 88 pence, or 6.5
percent, to 1,445 pence. The company said trading conditions
continue to be positive, with sales for the first half ahead by
8 percent at constant currency, including a 2 percent
contribution from acquisitions.
