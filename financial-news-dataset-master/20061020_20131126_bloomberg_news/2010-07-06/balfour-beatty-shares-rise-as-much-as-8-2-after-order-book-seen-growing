             Balfour Beatty Plc rose as much as
19.3 pence, or 8.2 percent, to 255.9 pence in London trading,
its largest rise since September.  
 Balfour Beatty said it expects its order book to be ahead
of the 14.1 billion pounds ($21 billion) reported in December
even as it sees “uncertainties” in some parts of its markets,
“particularly with regard to government funding of
infrastructure investment.”
