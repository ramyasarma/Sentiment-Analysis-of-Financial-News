             The euro may rise 3 percent against
the yen within three weeks as Europe’s debt crisis fades,
according to Standard Bank Plc.  
 “We have seen a reasonable degree of stabilization across
the euro zone in the last few weeks,”  Steven Barrow , head of
Group-of-10 foreign-exchange research at Standard Bank in
London, said in a telephone interview.  
 Investors should buy the euro targeting 113.9 yen and
should exit the transaction should the 16-nation currency drop
to 108.2 yen, Standard Bank said.  
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to 110.56 yen as of 1:50 p.m. in
London.
