             Police  are still hunting for
suspected gunman Raoul Moat who allegedly shot three people in
the north of England last weekend.  
 Moat, 38, allegedly shot his ex-girlfriend Samantha
Stobbart, 22, and killed her current partner, Chris Brown, 29,
in Gateshead on July 3. Police officer David Rathband, 42, was
shot in his patrol car in Newcastle on July 4. Rathband is in
critical condition after chest and facial surgery and Stobbart
is reported to be improving and in a stable condition, according
to the BBC.  
 Police have surrounded a house in the Springwell Road area
of Gateshead as part of their investigation, the BBC said.
Police have also released  details  of a car they are searching
for, a black Lexus IS200 SE with number plate V322 HKX owned by
one of Moat’s friends.  
 Moat was released from Durham prison last week after
serving an 18-week sentence for assault.
