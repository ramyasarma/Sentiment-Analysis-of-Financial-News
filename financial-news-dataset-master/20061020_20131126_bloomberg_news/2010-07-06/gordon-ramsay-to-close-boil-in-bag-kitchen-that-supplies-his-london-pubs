             Gordon Ramsay  is closing GR
Logistics Ltd., the suburban kitchen that earned unwelcome
headlines when  the Sun reported  that it produced meals in bags
that were sent to the  TV chef’s eateries  for reheating.  
 The ending of the business on Wandsworth Road follows
Ramsay’s decision to shut down one of his three pubs, the
Devonshire. GR Logistics supplies the Warrington and the Narrow
as well as Ramsay’s Chelsea bistro, Foxtrot Oscar.  
 “GR Logistics is a catering production company which will
close at the end of July following a review of its services.”
Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd. said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 The company, incorporated on April 1, 1993, was bought
from the Roux family of chefs and was previously called House
of Albert Roux Ltd. The Sun reported on its activities on April
17, 2009, under the headline, “Ramsay serves up coq au van.”  
 The newspaper quoted GR’s head chef, Darran Ridley, as
saying a coq au vin portion cost only 2.60 pounds ($3.94). The
Linkedin.com  website indicates  Ridley left the company four
months later and now works on the Queen Mary 2 cruise liner.  
 A call to GR Logistics this morning went straight to
voicemail.

chef’s newest restaurants, almost doubled its loss last year following the U.K. chef’s troubled entry into the U.S. market. Photographer: Alastair Miller/Bloomberg
