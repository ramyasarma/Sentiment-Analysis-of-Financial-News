             Bank of Korea researchers said it is
“inevitable” Greece will default because a shrinking economy
will push its debt to an unsustainable level.  
 The European nation’s  borrowings  will climb to 149 percent
of gross domestic product by the end of 2013, a level that
“exceeds the amount that can be continually maintained,”
according to a research report published today by Bank of Korea
economists Noh Jin Young, Lim Choon Sung and Chae Min Sok. A
default is not imminent, but may trigger “major chaos” in
global financial markets when it occurs, they wrote.  
 Greece is attempting its biggest social and economic
overhaul in a generation after overspending resulted in
borrowings estimated to be 33 percent larger than the nation’s
gross domestic product this year. Austerity measures introduced
since Greece disclosed in October that its budget deficit was
four times larger than the euro-region’s limit have led to
nationwide strikes and riots in Athens.  
 Euro-region ministers agreed to a 110 billion-euro ($146
billion) rescue package for Greece in May to prevent a default
and stop the worst crisis in the currency’s 11-year history from
spreading through the rest of the bloc.
