             Bank of America Merrill Lynch  hired
David Oman from UBS AG as chief risk officer for its Europe,
Middle East and Africa region.  
 Oman, who starts in October, will oversee the firm’s risk
strategy, Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America said
in a statement today. He will be based in London and act as the
main liaison with the U.K.’s  Financial Services Authority  and
other national regulators.  
 “As we strengthen our international risk strategy, it is
critical that we have strong regional leadership,” said  Bruce Thompson , chief risk officer at Bank of America.  
 Oman was previously European chief risk officer and global
head of counterparty credit risk at UBS.  Price  Sloan, the
