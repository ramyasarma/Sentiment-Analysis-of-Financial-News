             Russia considers a U.S. plan to
deploy interceptor missiles in Poland unjustified, Interfax
reported, citing Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov.  
 A missile-attack threat from Iran “doesn’t exist on the
scale that would require the deployment of such systems,” the
Moscow-based news service cited Ryabkov as saying today.  
 The U.S. and Poland on July 3 signed an agreement that
foresees deployment of an SM-3 missile-defense system. The
agreement will allow missile defense to protect areas of Europe
from attacks by states such as Iran “years earlier” than
planned, according to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
