             Asian  currencies weakened as signs a
global economic recovery is losing steam curbed optimism exports
will improve and prompted investors to favor safer bets than
emerging-market assets.  
 Malaysia’s ringgit retreated from a two-week high and South
Korea’s won dropped for the fifth time in six days after aa
report yesterday showed growth in Europe’s services and
manufacturing industries slowed in June. Economists forecast U.S.
data today will show expansion in service industries moderated
in the world’s biggest economy.  
 “A slowdown in the global economy will hurt Asian exports,
an important driver of regional growth, and that is weighing on
Asian currencies,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at
Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo.  
 The ringgit fell 0.4 percent to 3.2195 per dollar as of
11:49 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It yesterday reached 3.2025, the strongest level
since June 22. The won slipped 0.3 percent to 1,226.05 and
Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.3 percent to 9,086.  
 The U.S. housing market “won’t come back” for a long period,
Harvard University economist  Kenneth Rogoff  predicted in remarks
at a conference in Hong Kong today. A July 2 report showed
employment fell 125,000 in June, the first drop this year.  
 “There are questions about the growth outlook in Europe
and the U.S.,” said  Nik M. Khairul , a currency trader at Asian
Finance Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “This affected risk-taking
trades and fund inflows.”  
 Rate Outlook  
 A slowing global recovery may keep regional policy makers
from raising interest rates too fast.  
 Ten of 17 economists forecast Bank Negara Malaysia will
raise its benchmark  rate  to 2.75 percent from 2.50 percent at a
July 8 policy meeting, according to a Bloomberg survey. All but
one of 22 forecasters correctly predicted a quarter-percentage
point increase at the last meeting on May 13.  
 Citigroup Inc. sees a 40 percent chance of a pause on July
8 before the central bank adds to its two increases this year
either in September or November, Singapore-based economists  Kit Wei Zheng  and Monica Ratnaputri wrote in a report today.  
 Interest-rate swap traders are overestimating how much
borrowing costs in South Korea will rise over the next one year,
based on the one-year rate starting in 12 months, according to
Morgan Stanley.  
 Ten of 14 economists predicted the Bank of Korea will keep
its seven-day  repurchase rate  at a record-low 2 percent on July
9, unchanged since February 2009, a separate survey shows. The
Bank of Thailand meets to review borrowing costs on July 14.  
 Investors ‘Cautious’  
 The rupiah fell the most in a week after Bank Indonesia
yesterday kept its reference rate at a record-low 6.5 percent,
unchanged since September 2009.  
 “Investors are a bit tentative and cautious before the U.S.
data,” said  Joanna Tan , a regional economist at Forecast
Singapore Pte. The central bank may support its currency near
9,100 per dollar, she said.  
 The Philippine peso rose 0.1 percent to 46.44 per dollar
after the government reported an unexpected slowdown in
inflation for June, prompting central bank Governor Amando
Tetangco to say policy makers will enjoy “flexibility” at a
July 15 meeting. Consumer prices rose 3.9 percent from a year
earlier, the least in seven months, while economists  surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast a repeat of May’s 4.3 percent gain.  
 Elsewhere, Singapore’s dollar and the Thai baht were little
changed at S$1.3927 and 32.44, respectively, versus the
greenback. Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$32.198 and
China’s yuan traded at 6.7765, from 6.7758 yesterday.
