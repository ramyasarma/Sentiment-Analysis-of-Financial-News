             China should free jailed U.S.
geologist Xue Feng on humanitarian grounds and deport him, State
Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington.  
 Xue was sentenced to eight years in prison by a Chinese
court after being convicted of violating state secrets law by
selling a database on the country’s oil industry. Xue was also
fined 200,000 yuan ($29,550) on July 5 by a Beijing court at a
hearing attended by U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman.
