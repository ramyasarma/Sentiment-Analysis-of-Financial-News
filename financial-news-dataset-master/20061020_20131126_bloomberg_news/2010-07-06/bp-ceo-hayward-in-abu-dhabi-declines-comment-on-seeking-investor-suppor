             BP Plc  Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  said he was visiting Abu Dhabi for a few days and
declined to comment on whether he is seeking support from Middle
Eastern investors or shareholders.  
 “I’m just visiting,” Hayward said in an interview in Abu
Dhabi today. “I’m here for a couple of days.”  
 Sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East are reportedly
interested in buying BP stock after it dropped by half since the
start of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the worst in U.S.
history. Hayward last month pledged to set aside $20 billion for
spill victims and cleanup. To pay for it, the company canceled
three quarters of dividends and planned to sell assets across
the globe.  
 BP is a “good buy” after the drop in the share price,
Shokri Ghanem, Libya’s top oil official, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview today. He’s advising Libya’s sovereign
wealth fund to take a stake in BP.  
 The Kuwait Investment Office is in talks with BP about
increasing its stake in the company, the Guardian newspaper said
on its website on July 4.  
 BP has no plans to sell shares to raise funds, spokeswoman
 Sheila Williams  said today.
