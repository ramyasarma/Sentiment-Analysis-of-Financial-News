 Croatia plans to raise at least $500
million in its first sale of dollar-denominated bonds since
October 2009 as the nation bordering the Adriatic Sea struggles
to revive its economy.  
 The former Yugoslav republic is marketing new 10-year,
syndicated notes that may be priced to yield about 6.75 percent,
a banker involved in the sale said. Barclays Capital, Citigroup
Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are managing the new sale.  
 Croatia raised $1.5 billion from a 10-year note issue in
October 2009, priced to yield 7 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds fell for the first time in
three days, sending the yield 17 basis points higher to 6.37
percent at 3:35 p.m. in Zagreb, UBS AG prices on Bloomberg show.  
 Economic growth will stagnate this year as European
financial markets remain “unsettled,” the International
Monetary Fund said last month, downgrading its 2010 forecast for
gross domestic product from 0.2 percent growth in April.
Croatia’s economy shrank 5.8 percent last year on faltering
exports, investments and consumption as well as reduced capital
inflows.  
 The country’s long-term debt is rated BBB, two levels above
non-investment grade, by Standard & Poor’s, and Baa3, the lowest
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
debt over U.S. Treasuries declined for a second day, falling
five basis points to 3.33 percentage points, according to
JPMorgan’s EMBI+ Index.
