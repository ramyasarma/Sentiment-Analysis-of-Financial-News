             Crude oil is poised to resume its
decline and test new lows for the year in the weeks ahead,
according to a technical analysis by Barclays Capital.  
 Crude futures are “heading to the lows last seen in July
2009,”  MacNeil Curry , a Barclays analyst in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “The bigger picture includes a trend in
risk aversion, and we are seeing equities and risk assets
breaking down pretty hard.”  
 The 52-week low for the front-month contract is $58.32 on
July 13, 2009. The August contract may test support at the low
of $70.93 a barrel set on June 7, Curry said.  
 “That’s the initial support, which probably won’t hold,”
Curry said. Beneath that is a low of $68.59 on May 25, and then
there is “congestion support in the $66.81-to-$66.45 area.”  
 “Volume is picking up as we break down and volume tends to
go with the trend, so it all points to further weakness,” Curry
said. “Other commodities are trending down. The S&P is breaking
down and risk assets will remain under pressure.”  
 U.S. stocks fell last week, with the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  extending its longest slide since the financial crisis
of 2008, and commodities slumped as data on jobs and factory
orders added to concern the economic rebound is slowing. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  also dropped. The Dow and S&P closed
at their lowest levels of the year.  
 Crude oil for August delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped
$6.72, or 8.5 percent for the week, to $72.14 a barrel, the
lowest settlement price for the front-month contract since
June 8.
