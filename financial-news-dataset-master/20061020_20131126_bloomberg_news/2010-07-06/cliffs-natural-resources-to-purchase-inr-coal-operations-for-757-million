             Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.  agreed
to pay $757 million for the West Virginia coal operations of
closely held  INR Energy LLC  to raise its production to nearly 11
million tons by 2012.  
 Cliffs will finance the acquisition through available
liquidity, including cash on hand and its $600 million credit
facility, it said today in a statement.  
 The Cleveland-based company is North America’s largest
producer of iron ore, which is used in steelmaking furnaces.
Buying INR will increase Cliffs’ output of coking coal, also a
steelmaking ingredient. Coking coal prices will rise 52 percent
from last year to average $196 a metric ton in 2010 on growth in
Chinese steel production, Morgan Stanley said June 23.  
 With the INR assets, Cliffs will have the capacity to
produce about 9 million tons of coal next year, the company said
in the statement. Of the total output, 7 million tons is coal
used by steelmakers and 2 million tons is used at power
stations, Cliffs said.  
 Cliffs  fell  $2.40, or 5.1 percent, to $44.49 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The shares  have
declined 3.5 percent this year.  
 The INR operations include the underground Powellton and
Chilton-Dingess mines and the Toney Fork #2 open pit. The assets
will generate about $300 million in revenue and $100 million of
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in
2011, Cliffs said. Sales will be more than $400 million and
Ebitda will be about $175 million in 2012, it said.  
 On that basis, Cliffs is paying about 7.6 times 2011 Ebitda
and 4.3 times the earnings forecast for 2012. That compares with
“historical” multiples for coal in the U.S. of 5.8,  Michael F. Gambardella , an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York,
wrote in a note.  
 INR was advised by UBS AG, the bank said in an e-mail.
