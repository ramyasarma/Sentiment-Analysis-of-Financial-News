             Apple Inc.  blocked a developer from
its online applications store, alleging his items were linked to
fraudulent purchasing patterns.  
 Developer Thuat Nguyen and his applications were removed
from the App Store for violating the company’s program license
agreement, Apple said today in a statement. Confidential
customer data isn’t shared with developers, the company said,
recommending that users whose accounts may have been compromised
change their password and contact their financial institutions.  
 Technology blogs including  Engadget.com  reported that
Nguyen had controlled 42 of the top 50 titles in the App Store’s
book category. Some users reported having hundreds of dollars
charged to their accounts, according to Engadget.  
 Apple has 150 million registered users for its iTunes,
iBook and App Store marketplaces for purchasing music, e-books,
movies and television shows. More than 225,000  applications  are
in the App store, with more than 5 billion downloaded, according
to Apple.  
 Apple, based in Cupertino, California, rose $1.69 to
$248.63 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading .
The shares have gained 18 percent this year.
