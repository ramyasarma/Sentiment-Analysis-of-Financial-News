             K+S AG , Europe’s biggest potash
producer, has been approached by “numerous parties” interested
in  acquiring  its Compo home-and-garden fertilizer unit,
according to Chief Financial Officer  Jan Peter Nonnenkamp .  
 “We can imagine selling Compo if our expectations for the
price are met,” Nonnenkamp told investors in a presentation
yesterday. Spokesman  Michael Wudonig  confirmed the comments.  
 K+S, which hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise on the
sale, is exiting the Compo retail brand to focus on supplying
salt and potash to farmers. The division, which had sales of
about 400 million euros ($503 million) last year, may fetch at
least 110 million euros,  Gunnar Cohrs  and  Mirco Relling ,
analysts at Berenberg Bank, said in a note on June 14.  
 The company, based in Kassel, Germany, has not received any
binding offers for Compo yet, and aims to sell the unit by next
year, Wudonig said. Compo employs 1,100 people.  
 Compo’s competitors include Marysville, Ohio-based Scotts
Miracle-Gro Co. The U.S. company doesn’t see any “sizeable”
acquisition opportunities at this point in time, Chief Financial
Officer  Dave Evans  said in a  presentation  on June 29.
