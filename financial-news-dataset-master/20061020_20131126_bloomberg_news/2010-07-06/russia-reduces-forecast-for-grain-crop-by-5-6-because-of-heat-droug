             Russia’s  Agriculture Ministry  cut its
grain-crop forecast by 5.6 percent to 85 million metric tons
for the 2010-11 season because of heat and drought.  
 The forecast for exports is unchanged at 20 million tons
for the season that started July 1, the ministry said on its
 website  yesterday. Grain stockpiles of 24 million tons, or 20
percent more than a year earlier, will help to compensate for
the drop in production from 97 million tons a year ago, the
ministry said. Domestic grain consumption stands at 77 million
tons, it said.  
 At least 10 million tons of Russian wheat and barley
stockpiles held by the government are “frozen” as they are
pledged as collateral for loans and “it will take time” for
them to reach the market, SovEcon research center said on its
 website  today.  
 Twelve Russian regions have declared an emergency situation
because of heat and drought as the country is suffering from its
worst drought in a decade, according to the ministry. Farms
along the Volga, in the Urals and central regions have been
affected the most, the ministry said.
