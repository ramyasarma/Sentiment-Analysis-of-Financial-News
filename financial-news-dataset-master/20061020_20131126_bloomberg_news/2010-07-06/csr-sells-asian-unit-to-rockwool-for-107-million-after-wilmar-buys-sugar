               CSR Ltd ., Australia’s No. 2 building
products maker, agreed to sell its Asian insulation operations
to Rockwool International A/S for A$128 million ($107 million),
a day after Wilmar International Ltd. bought its sugar unit.  
 “Rockwool will acquire 100 percent of CSR’s insulation,
panels and trading businesses across the Asian region,” CSR
said today in a statement. The agreement excludes an aerated
concrete panel plant in Malaysia, it said.  
 Rockwool, based in Hedehusene,  Denmark , is the world’s
second-largest maker of insulation. The company is ready for
acquisitions, Chief Executive Officer Eelco van Heel said in an
interview last October.  
 CSR yesterday agreed to sell its Sucrogen sugar unit, the
world’s second-largest exporter of raw sugar, to Singapore-based
Wilmar for A$1.75 billion. Today’s sale, which includes three
mineral wool factories in China,  Malaysia  and Thailand as well
as a panel plant in  China , will leave CSR focused on aluminum
and building materials in Australia and  New Zealand .  
 “Our core geographic focus remains on Australia/New
Zealand,” CSR Building Products Chief Executive Officer Rob
Sindel said in the statement. “It is now appropriate to focus
our strategic agenda on these markets, whilst providing the
Asian businesses the opportunity to develop further under a
different ownership structure.”  
 CSR rose 0.3 percent to A$1.76 at the 4:10 p.m. close in
Sydney. The company was formed in 1855 and known as the Colonial
Sugar Refining company before changing its name in 1973 after an
expansion into building materials and resource projects.
