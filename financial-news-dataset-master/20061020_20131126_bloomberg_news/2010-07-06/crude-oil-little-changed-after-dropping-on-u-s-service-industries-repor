             Oil traded near $72 a barrel in New
York after rising on forecasts that crude supplies in the U.S.
declined and optimism that fuel demand will increase amid signs
of improvement in Europe’s banking system.  
 Oil snapped the longest stretch of declines since May after
U.S. equities climbed from a 10-month low on speculation
earnings growth will help the market rebound from its lowest
valuation since 2009. A Spanish bond sale quelled concern the
nation will struggle to fund its deficit. Crude inventories
probably fell last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “In terms of today, the market has been oversold and
that’s why we are seeing pricing resisting to go below $72 and
we are edging back up.” said  Victor Shum , a senior principal
with energy consultants Purvin & Gertz Inc. in Singapore.  
 Crude oil for August delivery was at $72.07 a barrel, up 9
cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:55 p.m.
Singapore time. It gained as much as 40 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $72.38 today. Yesterday, the contract fell 16 cents to $71.98.
Prices have declined 9.2 percent this year.  
 U.S. oil inventories probably dropped 2.75 million barrels
last week from 363.1 million, based on the median estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The Energy Department
is scheduled to release its weekly report at 11 a.m. tomorrow, a
day later than usual because of the Independence Day holiday.  
 U.S. Refining Rates  
 Refineries probably operated at 88.5 percent of capacity
last week, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous week,
according to the median of analyst responses.  
 “The U.S. inventory report may have a near-term impact on
oil,” said Purvin’s Shum. “General expectations are of a drop
in supply and that could help support oil.”  
 Brent crude for August delivery was at $71.54 a barrel, up
9 cents, at 1:54 p.m. in Singapore on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange. It earlier gained as much as 44 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $71.89 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Yesterday, the contract fell 2 cents to $71.45.  
 “The medium-term picture is one of recovery in the
international economy,” said  David Moore , an analyst at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. “The oil price will
ultimately return back to a $75-plus range, which OPEC has
indicated it’s more comfortable with.”  
 OPEC Reserves  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said its
proven crude oil reserves rose 4 percent last year, led by gains
in Venezuela.  
 The total amount of crude under OPEC territory advanced to
1.064 trillion barrels in 2009, the group said in its Annual
Statistical Bulletin yesterday. This follows an increase of 7.9
percent in 2008, the biggest in 20 years. Venezuela’s share
surged 23 percent to 211.2 billion barrels.  
 Current oil prices are “bothering everyone” because of
“volatility coming out from speculation,”  Shokri Ghanem ,
chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corp. and the country’s top oil
official, said yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview.
“This volatility has to come to an end.”  
 Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, pumped 1.55 million barrels a day of oil in June,
based on Bloomberg estimates.
