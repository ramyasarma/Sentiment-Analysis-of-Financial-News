             Coal shortage at 32 coal-based power
stations in India may lead to power cuts in the next two weeks,
the Financial Express reported, citing a Central Electricity
Authority official it didn’t identify.  
 According to the findings of the electricity authority, 17
thermal power stations have less than a week’s coal supply,
while 15 others have only four days of the electricity producing
fuel, the report said.
