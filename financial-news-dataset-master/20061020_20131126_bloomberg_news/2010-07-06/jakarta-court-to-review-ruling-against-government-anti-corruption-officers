             An Indonesian court that in April
ruled prosecutors should reopen a case against two anti-graft
officials will review that ruling today on the orders of the
country’s Supreme Court,  the Attorney-General’s Office  said.  
 “The South Jakarta Court has invited prosecutors to attend
the July 6 judicial review session,” the office said on its
website today. Five prosecutors have been assigned to represent
the government side, it said.  
 Prosecutors in December dropped an abuse-of-power case
against Bibit Rianto and  Chandra Hamzah , deputies of the
 Corruption Eradication Commission , or KPK, after anti-graft
groups accused the police of doctoring it to weaken the agency.
The step was taken to ensure harmony within law enforcement
bodies, the Attorney General’s Office said in a Dec. 1 statement.  
 The saga around the KPK deputies has clouded President
 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ’s success in fighting corruption and
led critics to say he is indecisive. The KPK sent governors,
legislators and other state officials to jail during Yudhoyono’s
first term from 2004 to 2009, improving the perception of
investors about the level of corruption in Indonesia.  
 The South Jakarta Court ruled in April that the reason for
terminating the case wasn’t acceptable. The Jakarta High Court
last month reinforced that ruling.  
 Those rulings prompted Attorney General Hendarman Supandji
to appeal and ask the Supreme Court to review the verdict. The
judges made “clear mistakes” when considering the case,
Supandji said on June 10.
