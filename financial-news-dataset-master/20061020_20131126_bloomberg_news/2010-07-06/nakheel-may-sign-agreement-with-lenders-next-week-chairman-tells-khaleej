             Nakheel PJSC, the Dubai World-owned 
property company restructuring $10.5 billion of debt, is likely
to reach an agreement with its lenders next week, the company’s
Chairman Ali Lootah was cited as saying by Khaleej Times.  
 "We are meeting with bankers on July 14 and hopefully they
will sign the contract,” Lootah told the Dubai-based newspaper.  
 Nakheel, the builder of palm-shaped islands off Dubai’s 
coast, said on June 30 it started making 40 percent cash 
payment to its biggest contractors after initial payments to 
trade creditors with claims of 500,000 dirhams or less. The 
company said in March that trade creditors would be offered 100
percent recovery of their claims -- 40 percent through a cash 
payment and 60 percent through a publicly tradable Islamic 
bond, paying 10 percent return annually.
