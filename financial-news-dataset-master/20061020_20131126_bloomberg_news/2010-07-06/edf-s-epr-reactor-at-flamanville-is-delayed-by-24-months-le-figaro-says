             Construction of Electricite de France
SA’s EPR nuclear reactor at Flamanville in Normandy is running
about 24 months late, Le Figaro reported, citing an unidentified
person.  
 EDF’s director in charge of the project, Herve Machenaud,
responded that progress is still being evaluated, the newspaper
said.  
 The company is likely to publish a new calendar for
Flamanville this month, the newspaper said, without citing
anyone.
