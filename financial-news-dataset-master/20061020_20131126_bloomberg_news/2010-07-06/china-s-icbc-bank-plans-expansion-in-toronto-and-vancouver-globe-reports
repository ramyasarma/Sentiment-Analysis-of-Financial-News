             Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China , the world’s biggest lender by market value, will announce
today an expansion in Canada, the Globe and Mail reported,
citing Mingqiang Bi, chief executive officer of its Canadian
business.  
 ICBC, which completed its purchase of six Canadian branches
from Bank of East Asia in January, will target newcomers from
China and businesses that operate in both Canada and China, the
newspaper said.  
 The bank will begin with clients in Toronto and Vancouver,
and hopes to move into cities including Calgary over the next
three years to five years, the Globe reported.
