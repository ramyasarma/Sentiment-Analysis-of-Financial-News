             News Corp. ’s MySpace, seeking to
replace a search advertising contract with  Google Inc.  that
expires in August, has held talks with  Microsoft Corp.  and Yahoo
Inc., according to a person familiar with the company’s plans.  
 Any deal would carry a substantially lower price than the
$900 million Google agreed to pay in 2006 to place search ads
within the social-networking site, a second person with 
knowledge of the discussions said. MySpace also remains in 
talks with Google about extending their partnership, they said.  
 MySpace has struggled to maintain ad revenue during an
exodus of users to Facebook Inc. and the departure of key
executives. Bought in 2005 for $580 million in cash, MySpace
lost its status as the world’s top social-networking site in
2008. News Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch  said
last year that the site would fall short of traffic commitments
to Google, lowering income on that deal by $100 million in 2009.  
 “We’re currently talking to multiple providers across the
many facets of search to bring our users the best possible
search experience in a social environment,” said Tracy
Akselrud, a spokeswoman for Beverly Hills, California-based
MySpace, who declined to name specific companies.  
 Microsoft is looking to boost users and ad revenue for its
13-month-old Bing search engine, which claimed 12.1 percent of
searches in the U.S., compared with Google’s 63.7 percent,
according to data tracker ComScore Inc. Microsoft has forged a
separate agreement to handle searches on  Yahoo ’s site
-- a deal that’s scheduled to take effect by December.  
 Pete Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment on negotiations with News Corp.
 May Petry , a spokeswoman for Yahoo in Sunnyvale, California, and
 Jane Penner , a spokeswoman at Mountain View, California-based
Google, also declined to comment.  
 MySpace Co-President  Jason Hirschhorn  left in June,
becoming the most recent high-level executive to depart the
business. He had taken the co-president role in February, after
 Owen Van Natta  stepped down as CEO.  
 News Corp.’s discussions with Yahoo, Microsoft and Google
were previously reported by the Wall Street Journal.
