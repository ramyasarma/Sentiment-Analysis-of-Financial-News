             One in seven Japanese university
graduates decided to stay at school this year because of the
nation’s bleak employment market, the Yomiuri newspaper said,
citing its survey of 589 tertiary institutions.  
 About 79,000 of 568,000 students that graduated in March
decided to continue their studies, the newspaper said. A further
31,000 that graduated are unemployed, the report said.  
 Some universities are subsidizing students that elect to
continue their studies, the Yomiuri said. At Kyoto’s Ritsumeikan
University, about 2,100 graduates continued study this year, an
increase of 500 students from last year, the newspaper said.  
 Many Japanese companies have a preference for hiring
graduates straight out of university. Students typically start
job hunting 18 months before they graduate, the report said.
