             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was upgraded
to “overweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
which said the firm does not need to raise money to satisfy new
capital rules.  
 Deutsche Bank AG was cut to “underweight” from
“neutral,” JPMorgan wrote in a report today, saying the German
bank may need 15 billion euros following an analysis of new
industry capital regulation.
