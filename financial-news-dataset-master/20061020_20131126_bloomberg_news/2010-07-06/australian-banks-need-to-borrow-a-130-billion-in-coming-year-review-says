             Australian banks, including
Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp., will
need to borrow at least A$130 billion during the next year to
repay existing debts and fund mortgage growth, the Australia
Financial Review reported, citing figures from JPMorgan Chase &
Co. The size and rising cost of borrowing may put pressure on
banks to lift interest rates, the Review said.
