             KKR & Co.  founders  Henry Kravis  and
 George Roberts  received $70.5 million each in compensation last
year, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
rules.  
 The amount includes valuation gains from a reorganization
of the firm prior to a planned listing on the New York Stock
Exchange this year, according to a filing with the SEC today.
Kravis and Roberts each own 86.7 million shares for a combined
25 percent of the New York-based private-equity firm.  
 KKR, which last year merged with its European publicly
traded fund, is slated to join larger competitor Blackstone
Group LP on the NYSE later this year. Private-equity firms,
seeking fees beyond those from leveraged buyouts, are using
public listings to raise additional money and expand into
investment banking and management of hedge funds and real
estate.
