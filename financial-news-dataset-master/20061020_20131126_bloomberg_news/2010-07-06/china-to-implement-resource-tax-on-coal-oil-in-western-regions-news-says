             China will implement a resource tax
in the western regions of the nation on coal, oil and natural
gas, the China News Service reported late yesterday, citing
Premier Wen Jiabao.  
 The tax will be levied based on the sales price of the
resources, according to the report, which didn’t give a date for
when the tax would be levied from or what percentage the tax
would be levied at. The China News Service cited comments made
by Wen during meetings held on July 5 and July 6.  
 China will also tax companies in some industries in the
nation’s western regions at a lower rate of 15 percent, the
China News Service reported, citing Wen. It didn’t say what rate
taxes on companies were being cut from.
