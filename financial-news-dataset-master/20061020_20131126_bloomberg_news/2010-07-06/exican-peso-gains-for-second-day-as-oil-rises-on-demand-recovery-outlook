             Mexico’s peso rose for a second day
as increasing prices for oil, the nation’s largest export,
spurred speculation the global economic recovery will boost
demand.  
 The currency rose 0.6 percent to 12.9891 per dollar at 8:52
a.m. New York time, from 13.0624 yesterday. The peso has risen
0.8 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, the third-best
performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “We are still seeing pointers from the commodities side,
especially oil,” said  Mike Moran , a senior currency strategist
at Standard Chartered Plc in New York. “Keep an eye on the
commodities, including copper, they have been an interesting
gauge of expectations on global growth.”  
 Oil for August delivery jumped 1.4 percent, the first
increase in six days, to $73.16 a barrel in New York. Mexico is
the second-largest supplier of oil to the U.S.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.12 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA, the lowest yield since the
security was issued in 2005. The price of the security gained
0.43 centavo to 125.90 centavos per peso.
