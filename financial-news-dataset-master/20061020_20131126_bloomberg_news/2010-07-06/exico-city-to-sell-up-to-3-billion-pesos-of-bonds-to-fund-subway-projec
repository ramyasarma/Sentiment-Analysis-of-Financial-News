             Mexico City plans to sell up to 3
billion pesos ($231.9 million) of bonds by the fourth quarter
to fund an expansion of the subway system, Finance  Minister Mario Delgado  said.  
 The city is following up on a bond sale that raised 2
billion pesos last month at a fixed rate of 7.9 percent and a
variable rate of 14 basis points over Mexico’s 28-day  interbank
rate , Delgado said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Mexico City
offices. The new bonds may have maturities of up to 10 years, he
said.  
 “We’ll see what the market conditions are and what terms
we can reach,” Delgado said. “The forecasts we have are that
the interest rates in our country will remain low.”  
 Mexico City’s budget will likely increase 6 percent to 140
billion pesos next year from 2010, he said. The city is
extending line 12 of its subway system, the largest
infrastructure project under construction in Mexico, Delgado
said.  
 The city doesn’t need to refinance because 85 percent of
its 45 billion peso in loans is held at lower rates and longer
maturities than what the market is offering.  
 The June bond sale was managed by  Deutsche Bank AG  and the
city paid fees of 10 basis points of the sale amount, Delgado
said.
Bidding for brokers will open in the fourth quarter and Mexico
City expects to pay similar fees, he said.
