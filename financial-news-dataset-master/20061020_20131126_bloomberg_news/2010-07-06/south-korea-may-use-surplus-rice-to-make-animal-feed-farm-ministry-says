             South Korea, the world’s third-
largest corn buyer, may use some of the nation’s surplus rice to
make animal feed to help stabilize the domestic rice market,
according to the farm ministry.  
 About 360,000 metric tons of rice produced in 2005 may be
turned into feed, the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries, said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 South Korea, which is 99 percent self-sufficient in rice,
imports almost all its needs for corn and wheat, used to make
animal feed. Using the rice for feed may reduce demand for
overseas shipments of the two grains.  
 The North Asian nation currently has 1.4 million tons of
rice in reserves, almost twice the 720,000 tons considered
adequate for emergencies, Yonhap News reported earlier today.
