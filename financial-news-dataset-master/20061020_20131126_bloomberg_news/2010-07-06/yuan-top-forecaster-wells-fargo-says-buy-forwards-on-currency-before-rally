             Wells Fargo & Co., the top forecaster
for China’s yuan, said investors should buy one-year non-
deliverable forwards on the currency as its rally outpaces what
the contracts have already priced.  
 The yuan will probably appreciate to 6.5 against the dollar
in 12 months from 6.78 today, outpacing the advance to 6.6775
priced into forwards of similar maturity, according to Wells
Fargo predictions. The contracts, settled in dollars, allow
traders to bet on the currency’s direction without access to it.  
 “There’s a buying opportunity in the NDFs,” said  Nick Bennenbroek,  global head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo in
New York. “Once the appreciation starts to pick up more speed,
that’s when the expectations for gains are going to be built
into the NDFs.”  
 Bennenbroek, 39, joined Wells Fargo in 2007 to build the
bank’s currency research department and was the most accurate
forecaster for the yuan in Bloomberg data covering as many as 48
firms. The San Francisco-based lender placed third in overall
currency forecasting for the six quarters ended June 30. TD
Securities Inc. in Toronto and Standard Chartered Plc in London
ranked first and second.  
 The People’s Bank of China said on June 19 it would allow
the yuan, also known as the renminbi, to trade more flexibly in
a 0.5 percent daily trading range after holding it at a 6.83 peg
against the dollar for two years.  
 Renminbi Trends  
 “The key to the renminbi was to monitor the economic and
financial backdrop to identify trends that would support the
decision to adjust the peg,” Bennenbroek said in a July 2
interview. “Half the equation was getting the economic and
financial conditions in place to support a change in currency
policy. We then were looking for events that would provide a
natural window for a change in China’s currency policy.”  
 U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said on April 3
he would delay a report due two weeks later on exchange-rate
policies, opening a “window” for China to change its currency
policy. Members of Congress had demanded Geithner use the report
to label China a currency manipulator.
