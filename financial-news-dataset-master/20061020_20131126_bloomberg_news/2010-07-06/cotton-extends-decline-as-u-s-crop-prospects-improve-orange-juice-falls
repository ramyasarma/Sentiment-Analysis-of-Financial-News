             Cotton declined for the fifth time in
six sessions on improving prospects for crops in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter. Orange-juice futures fell the most in
six weeks.  
 Drier weather in coming weeks should help crop development
in Texas, the biggest cotton-growing state, according to  Roger Haldenby , a vice president of operations for Plains Cotton
Growers Inc. in Lubbock, Texas. U.S. planting probably jumped 19
percent this year, the biggest gain in four years, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said June 30.  
 “Planting conditions have been very good with beneficial
rainfall,” said Roger Haldenby, a vice president of operations
for Plains Cotton Growers Inc. in Lubbock, Texas. “The weather
heading into July is supposed to be drier and very positive.”  
 Cotton for December delivery slipped 1.21 cents, or 1.6
percent, to 74.32 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. The price
has dropped 15 percent since reaching a two-year high of 87.1
cents on April 26.  
 Farmers planted 10.909 million acres of cotton this year,
up from 9.15 million last year, the USDA said June 30.  
 Prices also are falling on concern that slowing economic
growth in China and the U.S., or another recession, will curb
demand for textiles as cotton production rises, said  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at First Capitol Group LLC in Atlanta.  
 “Consumption concerns and a potential double-dip in this
economy are keeping cotton prices down,” Johnson said. “When
consumers hear this kind of news, they stay home from the
mall.”  
 Slowing Growth  
 In China, the world’s  biggest user  of cotton, manufacturing
slowed more than forecast in June, a National Bureau of
Statistics report showed July 1. The government’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index declined for a second month in June, falling to
52.1 from 53.9 in May.  
 As the outlook dims for consumption, farmers worldwide may
get the highest yields ever this year, with ideal weather in
Texas and India, Johnson said. India is the second-largest
producer and exporter of cotton.  
 Global yields will rise to 768 kilograms (1,693 pounds) per
hectare (2.471 acres) in the year starting Aug. 1, up from 739
kilograms estimated this season, according to the USDA. The
record was 794 kilograms in the year ended July 31, 2008.  
 India’s monsoon, which accounts for more than 70 percent of
annual rainfall, covered the entire country nine days ahead of
schedule today. The monsoon usually blankets the nation by July
15.  
 In another ICE Futures market, orange juice for September
delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 3 percent, to $1.466 a pound, the
biggest decline since May 25.
