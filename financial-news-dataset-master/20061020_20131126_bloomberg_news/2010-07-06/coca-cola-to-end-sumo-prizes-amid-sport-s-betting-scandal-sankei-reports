             Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. decided to end
its sponsorship of sumo yesterday because of an illegal gambling
scandal in the sport, the Sankei newspaper reported, without
saying how it obtained the information.   
 The National Federation of Agricultural Co-operative
Associations also decided to end its association, the report
said. Both organizations had supported the sport for about 30
years, the report said.  
 The government of Miyazaki prefecture in southern Japan may
also cut its support for sumo, the report said. The prefecture,
known for its Wagyu, has provided a prize of beef to tournament
champions since 1986, the report said.   
 Coca-Cola (Japan) provided cash prizes of 400,000 yen
($4600) for each tournament, Sankei said.
