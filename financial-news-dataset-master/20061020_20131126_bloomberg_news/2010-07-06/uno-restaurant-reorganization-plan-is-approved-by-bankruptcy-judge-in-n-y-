             Uno Restaurant Holdings Corp., the
owner and franchiser of a chain of pizzerias, received court
approval to exit bankruptcy.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Martin Glenn  in New York said today
at a hearing he will sign an order confirming the Boston-based
company’s reorganization plan.  
 “There are no remaining objections to the confirmation,”
 Joseph H. Smolinsky , an attorney for Uno, told the judge before
the plan was approved.  
 Uno, the operator of 91 restaurants and franchiser of 77
others, filed for Chapter 11 creditor protection in January,
citing reduced spending by consumers and increased costs.  
 The plan gives the holders of $142 million of senior
secured debt 100 percent of the stock in the new company.
Unsecured creditors who sell their claims will receive about a
13 percent recovery, Smolinsky said.  
 The company estimates that debt will fall to about
$40 million from $176.3 million.  
 The case is In re Uno Restaurant Holdings Corp., 10-10209,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
