             Brazil’s real rose to the strongest
level in two weeks as stocks in Latin America’s largest economy
climbed and consumer confidence gained for a second month.  
 The real climbed 0.8 percent to 1.7637 per dollar at 9:03
a.m. New York time, from 1.7774 yesterday. Earlier it touched
1.7606, the strongest since June 21.  
 Brazil’s Bovespa index rose 1.3 percent to 61,648.77.
Consumer confidence increased in June to 114.7, from 114.6 in
May, the National Industry Confederation said yesterday.  
 “People are starting to realize that after a very bad
June, there are bargains to be found, and that’s helping the
real,” said  Pedro Tuesta , a senior economist for Latin America
at 4Cast Inc. in Washington. “The consumer confidence numbers
suggest that domestic demand will remain strong.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 11.33 percent.
