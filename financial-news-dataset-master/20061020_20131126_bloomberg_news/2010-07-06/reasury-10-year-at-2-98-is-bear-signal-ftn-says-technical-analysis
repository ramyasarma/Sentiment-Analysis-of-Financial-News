             A close for  10-year Treasury  note
yields between 2.98 percent and 3.02 percent would signal the
yield may be near a bottom, according to FTN Financial.  
 The 10-year yield tumbled to 3.02 percent June 28 from 3.11
percent June 25. In a telephone interview today,  Jim Vogel , head
of agency-debt research at FTN in Memphis, Tennessee, said
reaching 3.02 percent “would be an indication that you would
fill in the gap that was created on the 28th.”  
 Conversely, if yields move lower, Vogel said the market
could signal higher prices.  
 “Bullish momentum resumes with a solid close below 2.93
percent,” Vogel wrote today in a note to clients. “Bond
traders continue to think bullish range as long as the S&P 500
remains so far below 1050.”  
 Ten-year yields fell 2 basis points to 2.96 percent at 1:04
p.m. in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 3.5
percent security due May 2020 rose 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000
face amount, to 104 19/32. The yield declined to 2.879 percent
on July 1, the least since April 2009.  
 “We’ve had higher closes on the yields,” Vogel said. “To
keep that pattern going you need to close somewhere around 2.97
percent or 2.98 percent, Vogel said. For now ‘‘we’re kind of
stuck,’’ he said.
