             Investors should switch from so-
called cyclical stocks in China in a rebound to independent
power producers, consumer and telecommunication shares,
according to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research’s David Cui.  
 Cement producers, steelmakers and bulk-shipping stocks may
see a “technical rebound” in the short term, Cui, China
strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch, said in a report sent to
clients today.
