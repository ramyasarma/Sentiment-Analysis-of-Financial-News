             The Australian dollar advanced,
snapping a two-day drop, after the central bank said in its
policy statement that consumer spending and business investment
are expanding.  
 The currency gained versus almost all 16 of its major
counterparts as stocks rallied, boosting demand for higher-
yielding assets. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board left the overnight cash rate target at 4.5
percent for a second month at the end of their meeting in Sydney
today as forecast by all 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “They are reinstating their view that domestic growth will
be about trend,” said  Ray Attrill , global research director at
Forecast Ltd. in Sydney. “The RBA isn’t being alarmed by the
global demand backdrop.”  
 Australia’s dollar rose 1.8 percent to 85.45 U.S. cents as
of 11:10 a.m. in New York from 83.93 cents yesterday, after
earlier dropping as much as 0.9 percent. The currency fell to a
three-week low of 83.16 cents on July 1. The so-called Aussie
gained 1.4 percent to 74.68 yen.  
 The New Zealand dollar traded at 69.63 U.S. cents from
68.86 cents, and rose 0.7 percent to 60.83 yen.  
 RBA Governor Glenn Stevens has increased interest rates six
times since early October from a half-century low of 3 percent,
citing an economic expansion the central bank forecasts will
almost double to 4 percent in the next two years.  
 Doves ‘Disappointed’  
 “The tone of RBA communication continues to be optimistic,
counterbalancing risks with the fact of Australia’s strong
economic prospects,”  Roland Randall , an analyst at TD
Securities Ltd. in Singapore, wrote in a note today. “The doves
were disappointed.”  
 Australia’s trade balance surplus swelled to A$1.65 billion
($1.4 billion) in May from a revised A$1.12 billion in April,
the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney.  
 The Australian currency reversed earlier losses as the  MSCI
Asia Pacific  Index of regional shares rose 1.1 percent and the
S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 1.3 percent.
