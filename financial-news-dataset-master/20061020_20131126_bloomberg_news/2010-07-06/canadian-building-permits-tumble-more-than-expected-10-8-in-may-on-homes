             Canadian  building permits  tumbled
more than five times as much as expected in May because of drops
in single-family houses and commercial buildings such as hotels
and offices.  
 The total value of permits issues by municipalities
decreased 10.8 percent -- the biggest decline since February
2009 -- to C$5.98 billion ($5.65 billion), Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
predicted a 2 percent decline, based on the median of 13
responses. The value of permits has fallen in five of the past
seven months.  
 The residential permits’ decline supports the central
bank’s April  prediction  that housing activity will “weaken
markedly” through the rest of the year and cut 0.1 percentage
point from growth next year.  Housing starts  fell to an
annualized 189,100 units in May and the  five-year mortgage  rate
rose to 6.25 percent in the last week of April, the highest
since the beginning of 2009.  
 “It does fit in the greater picture, which is the demand
side of the housing market is slowing pretty quickly and the
construction side is probably going to trail off as well,” said
 Robert Kavcic , an economist with BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.  
 The Bank of Canada raised its  overnight target rate  to 0.5
percent last month from a record-low 0.25 percent and said
future rate increases aren’t “pre-ordained.”  
 “The Bank of Canada might hike rates one more time and sit
on the sidelines for a while, just to assess how the economic
recovery plays out,” Kavcic said.  
 Non-Residential Declines  
 Permits for non-residential construction  fell 18.3 percent
to C$2.32 billion. Commercial buildings declined 35.2 percent
while institutional buildings, such as hospitals and schools,
fell 21.6 percent. Partly offsetting these declines were permits
for industrial building such as manufacturing plants and
utilities, which rose 47.1 percent.  
 Residential permits decreased 5.3 percent to C$3.66
billion. Housing permits were still 35.2 percent above the level
from a year earlier, Statistics Canada said.  
 Housing starts may keep slowing after two of Canada’s most
populous provinces -- Ontario and British Columbia --  harmonized 
their  sales taxes  with the federal goods and services tax on
July 1, meaning buyers of new homes will now pay higher taxes.
Starts in those two provinces may have been boosted by as much
as 10 percent over the last year as buyers rushed to beat the
tax, TD Securities economists  Derek Burleton  and  Diana Petramala 
said in a research note to clients today.  
 Burleton and Petramala said they expect housing starts to
drop to a 167,000 units annualized pace in the third quarter,
from an average of 200,000 units during the first half of the
year.  
 Single-family home permits dropped 9.2 percent to C$2.32
billion in May while multiple-unit dwellings rose 2.5 percent to
C$1.34 billion, the report said.  
 The agency also boosted its estimate for April’s gain to
5.9 percent, from the originally reported 5.4 percent.
