             General Electric Co. ’s $120 billion
asset management unit plans to increase holdings of emerging-
market bonds to take advantage of the global economic recovery.  
 GE Asset Management has 90 percent of its $60 billion of
debt securities invested in U.S. assets, said  Paul Colonna , who
has been the Stamford, Connecticut-based unit’s chief investment
officer for fixed income since 2007. That compares with a 50
percent weighting in equities, he said.  
 “The first step will be increasing our exposure to
emerging market sovereign and corporate bonds and after that to
other fixed-income areas,” Colonna said in an interview in
London. “Emerging markets are well positioned for global growth
versus developed countries.”  
 Emerging economies will grow 6.3 percent this year compared
with a 2.4 percent expansion for advanced countries, according
to International Monetary Fund estimates. Sovereign and
corporate bonds issued in developing markets including Brazil
returned 18.1 percent in the past year compared with 10.59
percent for U.S. debt, Barclays Capital indexes show.  
 About 30 percent of GEAM’s assets come from the U.S.
pension fund of General Electric, the world’s biggest maker of
jet engines and locomotives, Colonna said. A further 20 percent
derives from GE affiliated insurance companies with another 30
percent belonging to external institutional investors and some
retail clients. The remainder includes employee benefit
investments.  
 Worldwide Knowledge  
 “The general goal is to follow the path GE has followed
worldwide, taking advantage of the knowledge that the company
already has,” said Colonna, who joined GE from mortgage
provider Freddie Mac in 2000. The company will use external fund
managers “where we don’t have in-house expertise,” he said.  
 Brazilian real-denominated bonds are beating emerging-
market debt by the most since September as central bank
President  Henrique Meirelles  raises interest rates, bolstering
confidence in his efforts to contain inflation. Local bonds
returned 1.6 percent in the second quarter in dollar terms,
compared with an average  loss  of 1.1 percent for developing
nations, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  GBI-EM Broad
indexes .  
 “We are seeing how some big countries in Latin America and
other areas are developing their own local debt markets and
would like to take advantage of that,” Colonna said.
