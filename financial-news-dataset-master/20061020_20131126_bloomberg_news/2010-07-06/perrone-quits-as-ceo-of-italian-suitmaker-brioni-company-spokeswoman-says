             Andrea Perrone  resigned as chief
executive officer of Italian suitmaker  Brioni Roman Style SpA , a
spokeswoman for the Penne, Italy-based company said.  
 Brioni, whose suits have been worn by  Clark Gable  and James
Bond, will release a statement this afternoon, the spokeswoman
said today in an e-mail. She asked not to be identified. No
other information was available.  
 Perrone, the 40-year-old grandson of Brioni co-founder
 Gaetano Savini , was appointed sole CEO in July last year,
replacing a governing committee, of which he was part. The move
was partly to accelerate decision-making, he said at the time.  
 Brioni’s family owners ruled out selling a minority stake
to cut debt and fund expansion, Perrone said in a June 21
interview. The three controlling families had hired  BNP Paribas
SA  at the end of 2008 to help develop a growth strategy, which
could have included selling a stake of at least 20 percent.
