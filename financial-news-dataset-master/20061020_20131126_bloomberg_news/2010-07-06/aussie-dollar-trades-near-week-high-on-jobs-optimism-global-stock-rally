             The Australian dollar traded near a
one-week high amid signs the nation’s economy is weathering
effects from Europe’s debt crisis and ebbing demand from China.  
 The so-called Aussie may extend yesterday’s gain against
major counterparts before a report tomorrow forecast to show the
nation added jobs for a fourth month. The Reserve Bank of
Australia said in its policy statement yesterday that consumer
spending and business investment are expanding. The New Zealand
dollar was close to a one-week high as stocks from Asia to the
U.S. rebounded yesterday.  
 “The RBA held the line on its global and domestic growth
outlooks, seeing both at around trend,”  John Kyriakopoulos ,
Sydney-based head of currency strategy at National Australia
Bank Ltd., wrote in a note today. “We continue to see the next
move by the RBA as being a hike in November, which will support
a rebound in the Australian dollar in the fourth quarter.”  
 Australia’s dollar was at 85.09 U.S. cents as of 10:16 a.m.
in Sydney from 85.27 cents in New York yesterday, when it
touched 85.60, the highest since June 30. The currency fetched
74.57 yen from 74.62 yen.  
 The New Zealand dollar traded at 69.28 U.S. cents from
69.39 cents. It touched 69.75 U.S. cents yesterday, the
strongest level since June 29. The currency was at 60.71 yen
from 60.74 yen.  
 Australian employment rolls rose by 15,000 in June after
adding 26,900 in May, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before a statistics bureau
report tomorrow. The jobless rate held at 5.2 percent last month,
another survey showed.  
 RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board left the overnight
cash rate target at 4.5 percent for a second month yesterday.  
 The MSCI World Index advanced 1.7 percent and the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent yesterday.
