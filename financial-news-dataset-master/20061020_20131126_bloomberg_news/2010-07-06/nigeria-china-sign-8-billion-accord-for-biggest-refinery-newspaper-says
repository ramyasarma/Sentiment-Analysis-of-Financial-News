             Nigeria and China have signed an
agreement to build the West African nation’s biggest oil
refinery at a cost of $8 billion, ThisDay  reported , without
saying where it got the information.  
 The 300,000 barrel-a-day refinery will be located in the
 Lekki Free Trade Zone  in Lagos state, according to the report.
China State Construction Engineering Corp. will take up 80
percent of the project funding, while government-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp. will be responsible for the rest, the
Lagos-based newspaper said.  
 Nigeria’s four existing refineries have a combined capacity
of 445,000 barrels a day. As they are unable to operate at full
production because of ageing equipment and poor maintenance,
Africa’s largest crude oil producer has to depend on imports to
meet its oil-product needs.  
 Chinese investors will hold a stake of at least 25 percent
in the refinery, ThisDay said, citing  Billy Agha , Nigerian
National’s executive director in charge of engineering and
technology. Calls to China State Construction’s press office for
comment went unanswered.

                          July 6 (Bloomberg) -- Frederic Neumann, an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about India's competition with  China for natural resources.
     Indian Oil Minister Murli Deora traveled to Nigeria, Angola, Uganda, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela this year, leading a record number of delegations to gain oil for the world’s third-fastest-growing major economy. The flurry of visits is part of a new drive to find oil for India’s 1.2 billion people after losing out to China in at least $12.5 billion of contracts in the past year.
