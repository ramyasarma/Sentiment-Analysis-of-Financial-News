             Valovis Bank AG, a creditor to
insolvent retailer Karstadt AG, said it can’t agree to rental
conditions demanded by the department-store company’s selected
buyer Berggruen Holdings Ltd., endangering the takeover’s
completion.  
 Essen, Germany-based Valovis Bank, which says it’s
Karstadt’s biggest creditor and holds 36 department stores as
collateral, won’t approve conditions that would retain rental
reduction agreements even in the case of insolvency or further
sale, said  Hanns-Eberhard Schleyer , a lawyer advising the
lender, on a conference call with reporters today.  
 Valovis Bank, which is controlled by a KarstadtQuelle
employee trust fund, would face “significant liability and
legal risks” under Berggruen’s demands, Schleyer said. While
Valovis has agreed to reduce rents to 112 million euros from 141
million euros for Berggruen, it can’t accept applying the
agreement in the case of a further insolvency or sale of
Karstadt department stores because it would reduce the value of
the stores it controls, he said.  
 Valovis is seeking a meeting with Berggruen and other
interested parties to reach a “reasonable solution,” Schleyer
said. Only then can it also agree to Berggruen’s plan to split
the business into a so-called premium-department store unit, a
sportswear business and the regular shops, he said.  
 Billionaire  Nicolas Berggruen  last month won the bidding
for Karstadt, edging out two other offers. The contract has been
signed, though it is subject to “certain conditions” such as
an agreement on lower rents and rental conditions. Berggruen
spokesman  Wolfgang Weber-Thedy  couldn’t immediately be reached
for comment.
