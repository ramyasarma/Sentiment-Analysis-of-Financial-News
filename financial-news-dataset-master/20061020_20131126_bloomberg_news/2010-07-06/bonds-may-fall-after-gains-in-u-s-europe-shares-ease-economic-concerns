             Japan’s 30-year bonds fell for a
third day on speculation demand will weaken at an auction of the
securities tomorrow after the extra yield offered by the debt
over 10-year rates narrowed to the least in a year.  
 The Ministry of Finance will sell 600 billion yen ($6.86
billion) in 30-year bonds after auctioning 2.2 trillion yen of
10-year debt yesterday. The difference in yield, or  spread ,
between 10- and 30-year yields shrank to 74 basis points on July
2, the lowest since May 2009.  
 “The recent flattening of the yield curve seems to be
overdone, making 30-year bonds slightly unattractive relative to
10-year debt,” said  Hirokata Kusaba , a senior economist in
Tokyo at Mizuho Research Institute Ltd., a unit of Japan’s
third-largest banking group by market value.  
 The yield on the 30-year bond rose 3.5 basis points to 1.91
percent as of 1:25 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
price fell 0.718 yen to 107.388 yen.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.06 to
141.52 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The 10-year  yield  was
unchanged at 1.145 percent.  
 The spread between 10- and 30-year debt widened to 76.5
basis points. A yield curve is a chart that plots the rates on
bonds of the same quality and different maturities. It steepens
when yields on shorter-maturity notes fall, those on longer-
dated bonds rise, or both happen simultaneously.  
 Seven-Year Low  
 Ten-year yields declined to 1.055 percent on July 1, the
lowest since August 2003, as U.S. job reports and the lingering
debt crisis in Europe exacerbated concern the global economic
recovery will falter.  
 The decline in bonds was tempered before reports forecast
to show manufacturing contracted in Japan and slowed in Germany.  
 Japanese machinery orders fell 3 percent in May from the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists
before the government releases the data tomorrow. German factory
orders grew 0.3 percent, compared with a 2.8 percent jump in
April, according to a separate survey before today’s report.
