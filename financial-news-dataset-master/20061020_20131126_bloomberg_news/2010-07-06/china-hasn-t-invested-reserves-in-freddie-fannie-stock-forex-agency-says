             China’s foreign currency reserves are
not invested in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae stock, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said in a statement posted on
its website today.  
 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae’s bond repayments are normal,
the regulator said. Europe is one of the main investment markets
for Chinese foreign reserves, it said.
