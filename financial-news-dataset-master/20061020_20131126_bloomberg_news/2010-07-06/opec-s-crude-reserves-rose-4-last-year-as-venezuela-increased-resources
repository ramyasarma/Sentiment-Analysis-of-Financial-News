             The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said its proven crude oil reserves rose 4
percent last year, led by gains in Venezuela.  
 The total amount of crude under OPEC territory advanced to
1.064 trillion barrels in 2009, the group said in its  Annual
Statistical Bulletin  today. This follows an increase of 7.9
percent in 2008, the biggest in 20 years. Venezuela’s share
surged 23 percent to 211.2 billion barrels.  
 BP Plc said in its  Statistical Review of World Energy  on
June 9 that OPEC’s reserves grew 0.1 percent last year to 1.029
trillion barrels.  
 State oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA , known as
PDVSA, has tapped tar-like crude in the Orinoco Belt to swell
supplies as output in other parts of the country dwindle. The
Orinoco Belt is one of the world’s biggest oil deposits, with
513 billion barrels that may be recovered using current
technology, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  
 Reserves declined in Iran by 0.4 percent to 137 billion
barrels, and in Qatar by 0.1 percent to 25.38 billion barrels,
according to the report. Reserves in Saudi Arabia, which holds
the world’s largest, grew 0.2 percent to 264.59 billion barrels.  
 OPEC said that its share of global reserves advanced 0.6
percent to 79.6 percent.
