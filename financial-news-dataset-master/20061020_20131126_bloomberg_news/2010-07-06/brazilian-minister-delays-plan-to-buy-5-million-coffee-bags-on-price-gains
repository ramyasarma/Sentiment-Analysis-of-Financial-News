             Brazil, the world’s biggest coffee
producer, postponed plans to buy 5 million coffee bags after
prices rose, an  Agriculture Ministry  official said.  
 The government delayed plans to purchase the bags through
option contracts after coffee topped 330 reais ($186) a bag in
some regions, up from 280 reais in January,  Gerardo Fontelles ,
deputy agriculture minister, said in an interview in Brasilia
yesterday. Fontelles had said in May that the country was
planning to buy the coffee through options and direct purchases.  
 “There’s no need for purchases right now,” Fontelles
said. “Prices are high enough at the moment.”  
 Coffee growers are pushing the government to boost
purchases of the bean to help them recover losses and bolster
prices as trees enter the higher-yielding half of a biannual
cycle. In 2009, Brazil offered to purchase 3 million bags
through auctions of option contracts.  
 The contracts give growers the option to sell coffee bags
to the government for a set price and date if they can’t find
higher prices in the market.  
 Arabica futures for September delivery declined 2.3 percent
to $1.605 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 8:42 a.m. local time.
The beans slid as much as 3.5 percent to the lowest price in two
weeks on speculation prices climbed too high recently as it
jumped more than a quarter in the four weeks through June 25.  
 Brazil may harvest 47 million coffee bags this year, up
from 39.5 million a year earlier, the ministry said May 6.
Coffee production in Brazil reached a record 48.5 million bags
in 2002.  
 A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).
