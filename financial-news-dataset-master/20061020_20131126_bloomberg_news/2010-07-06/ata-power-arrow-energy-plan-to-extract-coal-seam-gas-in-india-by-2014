             Tata Power Ltd. , India’s largest non-
state generator, and Australia’s  Arrow Energy Ltd.  plan to
produce coal-seam gas from an area in central India by 2014.  
 Arrow, operator of the Satpura block in Madhya Pradesh
state, plans to drill 15 core holes and 2 pilot wells in the
first two years of its exploration plan to start initial
production of methane gas trapped in coal seams from 2014, Tata
Power said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 India’s Cabinet approved the award of seven coal-seam gas
blocks on  June 24  to companies including the Arrow-Tata venture
 Essar Oil Ltd. ,  Oil India Ltd.,  and London-listed  Great Eastern
Energy Corp.   
 Coal-bed methane, gas in shale, and tight gas held between
rocks are collectively known as unconventional gas resources.
India has coal-bed-methane reserves of at least 8 trillion cubic
feet in five discovered blocks, the oil ministry said Sept. 25.  
 The Satpura block may hold 900 billion cubic feet of gas,
Tata Power said in today’s statement, citing an estimate by
India’s Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. Brisbane-based
Arrow Energy holds an 80 percent stake in the block, it said.
