             German municipalities aim to invest
12.5 billion euros ($15.7 billion) in clean energy and combined
heat and power projects in the coming years, according to an
association that represents local utilities.  
 The municipalities will invest in the energy-efficient
projects in the “short and medium-term,” Stephan Weil,
president of the VKU municipal association, said today in
Berlin.  
 Energy companies owned by towns and cities supply about
half of Germany’s electricity, according to the VKU, and that
will increase as energy generation becomes more decentralized
and competitive, Environment Minister  Norbert Roettgen  said.  
 “Energy in 2050 won’t be the oligopoly it is today,” he
said today in Berlin. “Municipal power plants are an important
component of the transformation to just about 100 percent
renewable energy by 2050.”  
 Germany’s government is sketching out an energy strategy
that will be presented after parliament resumes meetings this
fall following the summer break. The ruling coalition opposes
construction of new nuclear plants and is mulling an extension
of a planned phase-out of atomic energy, Roettgen said.
