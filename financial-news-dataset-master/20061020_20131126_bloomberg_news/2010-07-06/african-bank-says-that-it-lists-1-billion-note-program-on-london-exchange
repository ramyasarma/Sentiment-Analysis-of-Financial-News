             African Bank Investments Ltd. , which
owns South Africa’s largest provider of unsecured loans, said it
listed a $1 billion Euro Medium Term Note program on the London
Stock Exchange to fund an expansion.  
 The program allows the company to sell bonds in the U.K.,
Europe and Asia and doesn’t permit sales of the securities to
funds based in the U.S., Group Treasure Gavin Jones said. Abil,
as the company is known, may sell the  bonds  in amounts equaling
about $300 million in size in dollars, euros or pounds, he said.  
 “We’re looking to access a wider investor base to meet
some pretty weighty growth expectations,” Jones said in a
telephone interview from Johannesburg today. “We’ll be watching
the global market over the next few months -- there’s no
compulsion to issue if the price isn’t right.”  
 Abil, which also owns a South African furniture retailer
called Ellerines, plans to grow loans at its African Bank
lending unit by between 20 percent and 25 percent in the full
fiscal year, Abil Chief Executive Officer  Leon Kirkinis  said on
May 24. The company posted an unchanged profit of 930 million
rand ($122 million) in the six-months to end-March, it said in a
statement on the same day.  
 “Over the next three to four years our balance sheet,
which is currently about 25 to 30 billion rand in size, is
likely to double,” said Jones.
