             Sri Lanka spinner  Muttiah Muralitharan , the record wicket-taker in both Test and one-day
cricket, will retire from the longer form of the game this
month.  
 Muralitharan will play his final Test match against India
starting July 18,  Sri Lanka Cricket  said on its website.  
 The 38-year-old has taken 792 wickets in 132 Test matches
and 515 wickets in 337 ODIs. He broke the record of 502 one-day
wickets held by  Wasim Akram  last year and eclipsed  Shane Warne ’s
mark of 708 Test wickets taken in 2007.  
 Muralitharan, who varies conventional off-spin with balls
that slide straight on and so-called doosras which turn the
other way, has averaged six wickets per Test. His 66 five-wicket
hauls in an innings are a record, as is his tally of taking 10
wickets in a match on 22 occasions.  
 Since making his Test debut in 1992, his action has
prompted accusations of throwing from match officials. He’s been
cited three times by umpires, only to be cleared of bowling
illegally on each occasion after undergoing laboratory analysis.  
 Another incident in March 2004 forced cricket lawmakers to
review their approach to throwing in international matches,
culminating in a relaxation of the rules to allow all bowlers a
greater degree of arm straightening in their delivery.
