             U.K. stocks  rose for a second day,
led by banks, amid speculation the stress tests for European
lenders will be less severe than forecast.  
 Barclays Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc led
financial shares higher. J Sainsbury Plc climbed 4.9 percent
amid newspaper speculation that the Qatar Investment Authority
may be renewing its interest in acquiring the U.K.’s third-
largest supermarket owner. BP Plc gained 4.8 percent.  
 The  FTSE 100  rose 49.82, or 1 percent, to 5,014.82,
reversing earlier losses of as much as 1.5 percent. The
Committee of European Banking Supervisors, which is coordinating
the tests, may disclose the process ahead of the results that
are due to be published on July 23, according to two people
familiar with the situation who declined to be identified.  
 “Details of the European bank stress for about 100 banks
have helped pare this morning’s early losses,” said Michael
Hewson, a markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.  
 European Union regulators have told the region’s banks that
planned stress tests may assume a 17 percent loss on Greek
government bonds, two people with knowledge of the talks said.  
 The FTSE 100 has tumbled 14 percent from its high this year
on April 15 amid concern that economic growth will be curbed by
austerity measures from European governments cutting their
budget deficits and disappointing economic reports in the U.S.
and China. The  FTSE All-Share Index  climbed 0.7 percent today
and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  plunged 2.2 percent at 4:52 p.m. in
Dublin as CRH Plc declined.  
 Barclays, RBS  
 Barclays gained 6.2 percent to 291.6 pence. RBS advanced
4.7 percent to 42.83 pence.  
 Sainsbury climbed 4.9 percent to 344.3 pence. Qatar may
soon increase its stake in Sainsbury to 29.9 percent prior to
making a cash offer of 500 pence a share, the Daily Mail said in
its market report column, without saying where it got the
information. The Daily Telegraph said there is speculation of a
bid at 550 pence a share.  
 BP surged 4.8 percent to 362.05 pence amid speculation
sovereign funds in the Middle East may invest in the oil
company. Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward , who held a
meeting with Abu Dhabi’s crown prince today, may seek support
from the Middle East after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill eroded
BP’s share price by more than 50 percent, according to  Saud Masud , the Dubai-based head of Middle East research at UBS AG.  
 CRH , the world’s second-largest maker and distributor of
building materials, sank 6.8 percent to 15.95 pence in Dublin
after forecasting a greater-than-estimated drop in sales.  
 Marks & Spencer Group Plc fell 2.6 percent to 343.4 pence
as the U.K.’s largest clothing retailer said it’s “cautious”
about the outlook for consumer spending. A proposed increase in
U.K. value-added tax and other measures to curb the country’s
budget deficit are likely to damp consumer confidence, the
London-based company said today.
