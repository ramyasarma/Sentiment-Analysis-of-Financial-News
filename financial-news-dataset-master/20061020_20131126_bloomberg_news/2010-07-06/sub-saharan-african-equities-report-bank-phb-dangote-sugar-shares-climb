             Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index  snapped two
days of gains, dropping 0.3 percent to 1,656.29 at the close in
Port Louis.  
 Kenya’s  All-Share Index  climbed the most in a week, rising
0.7 percent to close at 74.51. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index  advanced 0.1 percent to 25,170.31 at the close in
Lagos, while Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index  increased 2.4
percent to 737.29. The  Ghana Stock Exchange All-Share Index 
retreated 0.2 percent to 6,545.50 at the close in Accra.  
 The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 Bank PHB Plc  (PLATINUM NL), a Nigerian lender bailed out by
the country’s central bank last year, advanced to the highest in
two weeks, rising 7 kobo, or 4.8 percent, to 154 naira.
Nigeria’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 6 percent as it prepares to buy toxic debt from
commercial banks to revive lending, Governor  Lamido Sanusi  said
yesterday. The debt purchases will “reflate the economy,” with
each of the bailed out banks showing “improved profitability
compared with last year,” he said.  
 Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc  (DANGSUGA NL), Nigeria’s second-
biggest company by market value, rallied to a three-month high,
climbing 98 kobo, or 4.9 percent, to 20.97 naira. Raw-sugar
prices jumped to an 11-week high in New York on mounting concern
that adverse weather may limit output in Thailand and Brazil,
dimming prospects of a global surplus.
