             Canadian stocks  rose from an eight-
month low, led by banks, as shares worldwide rebounded on
confidence they are undervalued based on their profit outlook.  
 Toronto-Dominion Bank, the country’s second-largest, gained
3.3 percent as an index of Canadian lenders ended a nine-day
skid. Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s biggest base-metals and coal
producer, rallied 4.7 percent as copper climbed the most in six
days. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
fell 1.1 percent as the metal sank to a six-week low.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 107.67
points, or 1 percent, the most in three weeks, to 11,200.17.
Stocks rallied around the world after global equities retreated
to the cheapest level relative to earnings since March 2009.  
 Investors “are looking at valuation levels with the
expectation that earnings are going to continue to grow for the
balance of 2010,” said  Tony Demarin , chief investment officer
of BCV Asset Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which manages
C$225 million ($214 million). “Earnings estimates are guiding
higher every time analysts are asked where earnings are going.”  
 Analysts’ estimates  for 2010 earnings for the MSCI World
Index have increased 12 percent since March 31, according to
Bloomberg Data. The next earnings-reporting season begins July
12 when Alcoa Inc. releases second-quarter results.  
 Economic Concerns  
 The S&P/TSX slumped  7 percent  from June 18 through
yesterday as economic data from China and Europe indicated the
economic recovery may be slower than investors had anticipated.
Oil futures dropped 6.5 percent during the period.  
 The  S&P/TSX Bank Index  increased for the first time since
June 21, ending the longest streak of decreases since 2004.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s biggest bank, climbed 2.4
percent to C$52.37. TD rallied 3.3 percent, the most in 10
months, to C$70.18. Bank of Montreal, the No. 4 Canadian bank by
assets, rose 2.1 percent to C$58.55.  
 All six major base metals traded on the London Metal
Exchange gained, lifting producers of metals used in industry.
Citigroup Inc. increased its long-term price forecasts for
copper and for coal used in steel mills.  
 Teck rose 4.7 percent to C$31.68. First Quantum Minerals
Ltd., Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,
advanced 4.7 percent to C$55.64.  
 Rebound  
 Copper producer Taseko mines Ltd. soared  9.9 percent  to
C$3.65, after plunging 20 percent yesterday and 19 percent last
week.  
 A Canadian government panel said July 6 Taseko’s proposed
C$3 billion Prosperity copper and gold mine in British Columbia
would harm the environment. After the market closed yesterday,
the company said it is confident the Canadian Cabinet will allow
the project to go forward after considering its economic and
social benefits.  
 Crude oil fluctuated after five days of declines as the
U.S. dollar weakened to a six-week low against the euro and
advancing equities boosted speculation that the global economic
recovery will spur fuel demand.  
 Cenovus Energy Inc., the oil producer spun off from EnCana
Corp. in December, increased 1.9 percent to C$27.50. Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company
by market value, climbed 2.4 percent to C$34.81. TransCanada
Corp., the owner of Canada’s biggest pipeline system, rose 1.4
percent to C$36.41.  
 Twenty-four of 29  S&P/TSX Gold Index  companies dropped as
the metal closed below $1,200 an ounce for the first time since
May 25. Gold slipped as the euro advanced with demand recovering
for higher-yield currencies.  
 Miners’ Shares  
 Barrick declined 1.1 percent to C$45.44. Goldcorp Inc.,
Canada’s second-largest gold producer, lost 1.7 percent to
C$42.85. Kinross Gold Corp., the No. 3 company in the industry
in Canada by revenue, decreased 3.1 percent to C$16.87.  
 Imax Corp., the maker of giant movie screen systems,
retreated for a sixth day, plunging 11 percent to C$12.95. “The
Twilight Saga: Eclipse” generated sales of $46,632 per Imax
screen in its opening weekend, less than comparable numbers for
“Toy Story 3,” “Iron Man 2” or “Alice in Wonderland,”
Merriman Curhan Ford Group Inc. analyst  Eric Wold  said in a note
to clients.  
 Astral Media Inc., which owns 82 Canadian radio stations,
climbed 3.7 percent, the most in eight months, to C$35.63. Royal
Bank analyst  Drew McReynolds  raised his earnings estimates for
the company, citing “a broad recovery in the radio advertising
market” in a note to clients.  
 Pharmaceutical retailer Jean Coutu Group Inc. gained 2.6
percent to C$8.39 after reporting first-quarter profit in line
with the average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Royal Bank analyst  Irene Nattel  called the results “solid” in
a note to clients.
