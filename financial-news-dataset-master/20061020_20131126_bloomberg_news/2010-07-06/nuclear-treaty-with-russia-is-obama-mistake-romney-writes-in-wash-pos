             President  Barack Obama ’s foreign-
policy moves, including a new nuclear weapons treaty with
Russia, were criticized as mistakes by former Republican
presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  in a Washington Post opinion
column today.  
 Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, said the Senate
shouldn’t ratify the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New
START, because it “impedes missile defense, our protection from
nuclear-proliferating rogue states such as Iran and North
Korea.”  
 Obama and Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  signed the
treaty in April and discussed how to obtain its ratification
when the two leaders met in Washington last month.  
 The treaty doesn’t let the U.S. convert intercontinental
ballistic missile silos into missile-defense facilities, Romney
said. The agreement also lets the Russians break the treaty if
they believe the U.S. has boosted its missile defenses.  
 The treaty’s terms are the latest failure of the Obama
administration, Romney wrote. The president has criticized
Israel while not confronting Hamas for launching 7,000 rockets
from the Gaza strip, Romney said.
