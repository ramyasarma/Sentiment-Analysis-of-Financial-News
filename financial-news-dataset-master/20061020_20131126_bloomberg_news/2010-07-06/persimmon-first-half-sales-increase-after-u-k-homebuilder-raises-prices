             Persimmon Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest homebuilder by volume, said sales in the first six
months of the year rose 26 percent as the housing market’s
recovery enabled the company to increase prices.  
 Revenue climbed to 785 million pounds ($1.2 billion), the
York, England-based company said in a statement today, without
giving a figure for last year. Debt amounted to about 122
million pounds as of June 30, down from 494 million pounds a
year earlier.  
 “We have made good progress with our planned strategy of
debt reduction and margin improvement,” Persimmon said in the
statement. “Whilst we remain cautious, we have a strong
platform for profit growth as and when the housing market
improves further.”  
 U.K. house prices rose for a fourth month in June to a two-
year high as the property market showed “broad stability,”
Nationwide Building Society said June 30. Mortgage approvals
still remain at about half the level during the housing boom in
2007. Prices are now 8.6 percent lower than the peak.  
 Persimmon said its operating profit margin excluding one-
time gains and losses increased to 7.5 percent from 1.5 percent
a year earlier. The average selling price was 168,500 pounds.
