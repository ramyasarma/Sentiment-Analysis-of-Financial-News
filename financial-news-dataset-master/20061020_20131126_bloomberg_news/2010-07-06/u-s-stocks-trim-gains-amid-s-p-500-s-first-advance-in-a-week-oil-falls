             U.S. stocks trimmed gains in the
first advance in a week for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as
shares of financial, industrial and consumer companies retreated
from their highest levels of the day. Oil erased a 2.4 percent
rally.  
 The S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent to 1,031.31 after climbing as
much as 2 percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
increased 72.51 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,758.99, paring a
rally of as much as 172 points.
