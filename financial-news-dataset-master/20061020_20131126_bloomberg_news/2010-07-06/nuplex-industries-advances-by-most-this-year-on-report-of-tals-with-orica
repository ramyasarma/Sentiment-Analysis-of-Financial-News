             Nuplex Industries Ltd. , a New Zealand
resin manufacturer, pared gains in Wellington trading after the
company denied a report it was in talks with Orica Ltd. to sell
its chemicals trading unit.  
 Nuplex isn’t involved in discussions with Sydney-based
Orica on combining or merging chemical trading platforms, the
Auckland-based company said in a statement today. Melbourne’s
Herald Sun newspaper had reported there were talks, citing
unidentified people in the industry. Nuplex shares rose 2.1
percent after earlier gaining as much as 5.3 percent.  
 The two companies, the largest wholesale distributors of
chemicals in Australia with a combined 20 percent of the market,
wanted to merge their units and then divest through a public
share offer or trade sale, the Herald Sun reported. Nuplex,
which makes resins used in paints and construction materials,
may also be in talks with Covington, Kentucky based Ashland Inc.
on its chemical unit, the newspaper said.  
 Nuplex  shares  rose 6 cents to NZ$2.91 at 1:35 p.m. in
Wellington trading. Orica shares rose 0.6 percent to A$25.08 at
11:35 a.m. in Sydney.
