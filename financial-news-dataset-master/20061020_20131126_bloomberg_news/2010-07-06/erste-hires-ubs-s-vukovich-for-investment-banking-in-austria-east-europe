             Erste Group Bank AG , Austria’s
biggest publicly traded lender, appointed  Klaus Vukovich  as
managing director for investment banking to oversee domestic and
central European mergers and acquisitions.  
 Vukovich, 35, previously worked for  UBS AG  in London as an
executive director for investment banking in Austria and eastern
Europe, Erste said by e-mail. In his new role in Vienna, he will
be “responsible for origination and execution of M&A
transactions in Austria and closely involved in managing the M&A
franchise across the region,” the bank said.  
 Prior to his four years at UBS, Vukovich, a native
Austrian, worked for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in London
from 2000 to 2006.  
 Erste, based in Vienna, is expanding its investment banking
business as Verbund AG and EVN AG plan share sales in Austria
and KBC Groep NV aims to sell a minority stake in its Czech
banking unit in an initial public offering. In Romania, OMV
Petrom SA is planning a 600 million-euro ($755 million) capital
increase and the Romanian government aims to reduce its stake in
the oil company.  
 While the belief among economists that eastern Europe
should grow faster than western Europe has led to increased
interest in doing deals, the levels of completed leveraged
buyouts are “nowhere near” those of two or three years ago,
Garret Byrne, a partner at Deloitte & Touche LLP, said in an
interview last week, adding that the Czech Republic and Poland
are the most active markets in the region.
