             Coffee prices in New York fell the
most since November on speculation that global supplies will
increase as production jumps in Brazil, the world’s largest
grower. Cocoa also dropped.  
 Brazil’s coffee output may total 47 million bags this year,
up 19 percent from a year earlier, as trees enter the higher-
yielding phase of a two-year cycle, according to the Agriculture
Ministry. No frost is forecast for coffee-growing areas through
July 9, the government’s weather agency said on its website.  
 “Fundamentals are bearish,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior
analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago. “The Brazilian
crop is expected to be big, and there’s no news, like threat of
freezing temperatures, to push prices up. Coffee has lost its
upside momentum.”  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery fell 6.65 cents, or 4
percent, to $1.5765 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the
biggest loss for a most-active contract since Nov. 10. Earlier,
the price reached $1.5685, the lowest level since June 18.
Futures are down 11 percent since reaching a 12-year high on
June 24.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, robusta-coffee futures for
September delivery dropped $60, or 3.5 percent, to $1,650 a
metric ton, after touching $1,643, the lowest price since June
24.  
 Arabica coffee, a variety grown in Brazil and brewed by
companies such as Starbucks Corp., may fall as low as $1.50 a
pound by the end of the week, Cruel said.  
 Further Drop Predicted  
 Robusta beans, used mostly in instant coffee, are harvested
mostly in Asia and parts of Africa. Each bag weighs 132 pounds,
or 60 kilograms.  
 Arabica prices surged as much as 31 percent since the end
of May to $1.765 on June 24. Robusta jumped as much as 34
percent in the same period.  
 “On the way up, there was a lot of panic buying and short-
covering,”  Angus Kerr , owner of trading company Coffee ag in
Cobham, England, said by telephone, referring to purchases that
closed bets on falling prices. “The market has further to come
down before it consolidates.”  
 Cocoa for September delivery slipped $4, or 0.1 percent, to
$2,967 a ton in New York. On London’s Liffe, cocoa futures for
September delivery dropped 6 pounds, or 0.3 percent, to 2,394
pounds ($3,627) a ton.
