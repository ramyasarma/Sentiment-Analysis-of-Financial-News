             Alexander Voloshin , who was ousted as
chairman of  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel  last week following a
disputed board election, will be reinstated at the next meeting
of the company’s investors,  United Co. Rusal  said.  
 “Voloshin will be elected at the next shareholder
meeting,” Rusal Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska  told
reporters in London today. Rusal owns 25 percent of Norilsk.  
 “We have a government request to restore Voloshin as a
chairman because he was nominated by Vnesheconombank,”
Deripaska said. State-owned Russian lender Vnesheconombank,
which isn’t a Norilsk shareholder, is able to vote because it
gave Rusal a $4.5 billion emergency bailout at the end of 2008.  
 The disagreement has renewed tensions between Deripaska and
fellow Norilsk investor  Vladimir Potanin , whose Interros Holding
Co. won four seats on the board while Rusal got three. A feud
between the two men over Norilsk’s management in 2008 only ended
when they agreed not to seek board seats for themselves or
pursue plans to merge Norilsk and Rusal for three years.  
 Rusal, controlled by Deripaska, said yesterday the outcome
of the June 28 vote was the result of “manipulation” and it
will call an investor meeting to re-elect board members.
Voloshin’s candidacy had been agreed on with Interros and backed
by the state, Rusal said last week.  
 Deripaska Demands  
 Rusal is seeking a bigger  dividend  payout from Norilsk, the
world’s largest nickel producer. Deripaska has demanded Norilsk
improve the profitability of its nickel and copper mining and
sell its stake in U.S. precious-metals producer Stillwater
Mining Co., as well as assets acquired when Norilsk bought
LionOre Mining International Ltd. in 2007.  
 Deripaska, who was elected to Norilsk’s board last week,
said he doesn’t envisage a repeat of the previous spat with
Interros.  
 “I can’t see that they would go to such extremes,” he
said. “We can restore Rusal’s position on the board.”  
 Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer, wants four to
five people on the board and would be “happy” to have three
independent directors, Deripaska said. “Seven out of 13” seats
“would guarantee corporate governance is in place,” he said.  
 Andrei Kirpichnikov , a Moscow-based spokesman for Interros,
declined to comment.
