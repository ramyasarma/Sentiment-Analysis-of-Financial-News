             Hong Kong billionaire  Richard Li  is
negotiating with large U.S. and European banks and U.S.
companies to restructure 800 million euros ($1 billion) of debts
owed by Bulgarian phone company Vivacom AD,  Standart  reported.  
 The funds were borrowed two years ago by Vivacom’s previous
owner  American International Group Inc . to acquire the company
from Icelandic billionaire  Thor Bjorgolfsson , the newspaper
said, citing unidentified persons.  
 Creditors with whom Li is negotiating include Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Deutsche Bank AG, the newspaper said.  
 Li’s Pacific Century Group bought PineBridge Investments,
the company which ran Vivacom, from AIG in March. Vivacom was
formerly known as the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company.
