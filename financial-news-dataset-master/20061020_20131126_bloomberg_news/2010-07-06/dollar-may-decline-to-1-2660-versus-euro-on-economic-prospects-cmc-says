             The  dollar  may extend its decline to
a level versus the euro last seen in May as concern shifts from
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis to slowing U.S. growth prospects,
according to CMC Markets.  
 “The onslaught of disappointing U.S. figures, ranging from
new home sales to net job losses, accelerated the decline in
U.S. yields,” wrote  Ashraf Laidi , chief market strategist in
London at CMC, an online trading company, in a note to clients
today. “Consequently, the U.S. dollar could only head lower.”  
 The dollar may decline to $1.2660 versus the euro, a level
last reached May 21, and slide to 85.70 U.S. cents versus the
Australian dollar.  
 The  yield  on the 10-year Treasury note dropped last week
for a third straight week to 2.98 percent after falling on
July 1 to 2.8793 percent, the lowest level since April 2009. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  tumbled 5 percent last week
following a 3.7 percent loss in the previous week.  
 The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian
dollar, Swiss franc and Swedish krona, dropped last week for a
fourth week, falling to 84.427. It reached 84.132 on July 2, the
lowest level since May 10.  
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls decreased in June for the first time
this year, losing 125,000 jobs, Labor Department figures showed
last week. The number of contracts to purchase previously owned
houses in the U.S. plunged 30 percent in May, the National
Association of Realtors reported. That is more than twice as
much as economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast.
