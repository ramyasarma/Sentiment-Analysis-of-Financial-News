             Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  will
likely price shares today in an initial public offering that may
raise as much as $20.1 billion, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  
 China’s largest bank by customers is selling 25.4 billion
shares in Hong Kong at HK$2.88 to HK$3.48 apiece, and an
additional 22.2 billion in Shanghai at 2.52 yuan to 2.68 yuan.
Beijing-based Agricultural Bank has said it expects to announce
final pricing tomorrow.  
 Agricultural Bank’s IPO, potentially the largest ever, is
coinciding with an equities rout that saw  Shanghai’s benchmark
index  reach a 15-month low yesterday. The company is selling
shares in Hong Kong at a valuation discount of at least 5.4
percent compared with its three largest  competitors  based on
book value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “We estimate that the IPO price of Agricultural Bank will
be at about a 10 percent discount to prices of listed big
banks,” said  Dai Ming , a fund manager at Shanghai Kingsun
Investment Management & Consulting Co. “That’ll leave room for
a possible first-day gain.”  
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. raised $21.9
billion in an IPO in October 2006. That included a so-called
overallotment option to expand the sale after listing.
Agricultural Bank can increase the size of its IPO to as much as
$23.1 billion.  
 Kenneth Rogoff , the Harvard University professor and former
chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, warned today
that China’s property market is beginning a “collapse” that
will hit the nation’s banking system, echoing views from Fitch
Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.  
 Mao’s Rule  
 Set up in 1951 by  Mao Zedong  to finance rural cooperatives,
Agricultural Bank was the first Chinese commercial lender
established during Communist rule. It was the last major state
bank to go through restructuring, receiving a bailout valued at
about $139 billion in 2008.  
 Agricultural Bank, with 320 million customers and 23,624
outlets in China, advanced a record 1 trillion yuan of new loans
last year, more than the gross domestic economy of New Zealand.
Its overall non-performing loan ratio stood at 2.91 percent as
of Dec. 31, the highest among China’s largest lenders.  
 Of loans to property developers, 3.47 percent were listed
as delinquent at the end of last year.
