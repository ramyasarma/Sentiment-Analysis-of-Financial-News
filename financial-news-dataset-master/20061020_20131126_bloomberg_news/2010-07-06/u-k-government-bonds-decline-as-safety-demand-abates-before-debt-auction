             U.K. government bonds fell and the
pound advanced as stock markets climbed, curbing demand for the
safest assets.  
 The decline for gilts pushed the 10-year  yield  up from near
the lowest in more than 14 months. The pound rose against the
dollar as the appetite for riskier assets damped demand for the
U.S. currency, and the benchmark FTSE 100 Index of shares
climbed as much as 3 percent, the most in more than a month.
Gilts declined at a slower pace than German bunds after the U.K.
sold 3.25 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) of 3.75 percent bonds
due 2020, with demand increasing from the previous sale.  
 “Equities are up today, it’s a risk-on day, so yields are
higher across the bond markets,” said  Chiara Cremonesi , a
strategist at UniCredit SpA in London. “The bid-to-cover ratio
for today’s auction is really strong and gilts should continue
to outperform.”  
 The 10-year gilt yield rose three basis points to 3.35
percent as of 5 p.m. in London. The 4.75 percent security
maturing in March 2020 slid 0.23, or 2.3 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 111.51.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
rather than benchmark German bunds slid 2 basis points to 76
basis points.  
 The Debt Management Office received bids for 2.45 times the
amount of 2020 bonds on offer today, compared with 1.86 at the
previous sale of the securities on June 9. The average yield was
3.467 percent, from 3.633 percent at the previous auction.  
 Budget Cuts  
 Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s efforts to reduce the budget
deficit have helped boost gilts’ relative returns versus other
government securities. U.K. government bonds made 3.7 percent
since the May 6 election while German bonds returned 2.4 percent
over the same period, according to indexes complied by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts’ Societies.  
 The European Union said today the U.K. has taken effective
action to rein in the budget deficit without “suffocating” the
economic recovery.”  
 Concern the cuts would slow growth helped send the 10-year
yield to 3.31 percent yesterday, within one basis point of the
lowest since April 2009.  
 The pound strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.5179, after
reaching $1.5229 two trading days ago, the strongest level since
May 4. It weakened 0.6 percent against the euro at 83.33 pence.
It was 0.1 percent higher at 132.92 yen.  
 The gains against the Japanese currency may be short-lived,
according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., which
recommended selling the pound versus the yen because U.K.
economic growth may slow, forcing policy makers to retain
“loose” monetary policy as the government cuts spending.  
 Interest Rates  
 Investors should aim for an 8 percent decline of the pound
against the yen to 123,  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist in
London, said today in a research report.  
 The Bank of England will keep its benchmark interest rate
on hold at a record low until at least May 2011 as the spending
cuts weigh on the economic recovery, the British Chambers of
Commerce said. Policy makers will hold the rate at 0.5 percent
when they announce the result of their monthly meeting on July
8, according to all 60 economists polled by Bloomberg.  
 “We now have in place a very tough fiscal policy and this
makes the risks of a double-dip recession even greater,” BCC
Chief Economist  David Kern  told reporters in London. “It makes
it more necessary, policy-wise, for the Bank of England to keep
interest rates low.”
