             Australia’s  building industry  shrank
in June at the fastest pace in 10 months, a sign the most 
aggressive round of interest rate increases among Group of 20 
members is eroding demand for new dwellings.  
 The index fell 6.8 points to 46.4 from May, according to a
survey by the Australian Industry Group and Housing Industry
Association released in Sydney today. A reading below 50 shows
the industry is contracting.  
 Australia’s central bank paused in raising borrowing costs
yesterday for a second month, and dropped a reference to the
level of its benchmark being appropriate for the “near term,”
a sign policy makers may keep rates unchanged in coming months.
The drop in today’s construction index was led by the first
contraction in demand for homes in 10 months.  
 “The housing outcome together with the continuing weakness
of the apartment sector reinforces other signs of flat household
spending,” said  Peter Burn , director of public policy at the
Australian Industry Group. “With employment and new orders
falling in other sub-sectors, June marked a turn for the worse
for the construction sector as a whole.”  
 A gauge of engineering work rose 10.4 points to 52.9 in
June and commercial work advanced 1.3 points to 51.8, today’s
report showed. Apartment building gained 2 points to 44.
