             Delaware River Port Authority , the
Philadelphia toll-bridge operator that lost more than $60
million on derivative bets, plans to borrow $320 million as
weekly issuance falls to the lowest in 10 months.  
 States and municipalities are scheduled to sell about $2.92
billion in debt this week, shortened by the Independence Day
observance. That’s down from  $4.6 billion  last week and the
 lowest  since Sept. 4, another four-day week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The  DRPA , jointly set up by  Pennsylvania  and  New Jersey ,
may benefit from a sparse market, said  John Flahive , Boston-
based director of fixed income for BNY Mellon Wealth Management,
which manages about $20 billion in municipal bonds.  
 “You won’t have a lot of competition, so it’s not a bad
time to come to the market,” Flahive said in an interview.
“Given the time of year, there will be people looking for well-
priced deals.”  
 The Camden, New Jersey-based port authority owns the
 Benjamin Franklin ,  Betsy Ross ,  Walt Whitman  and  Commodore Barry 
bridges in the Philadelphia area as well as a  commuter-rail 
line. Revenue in 2008 rose 4.3 percent to $271.8 million, while
expenses increased 2.3 percent to $267.2 million, according to
the agency’s most recent  annual report .  
 Interest-Rate Swaps  
 DRPA agreed to seven interest-rate swaps with various banks
in 2000 and 2001, collecting $44.6 million in upfront payments.
It lost at least $62.6 million on the deals since then,
including a $13.3 million payment to the bankrupt Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, to cancel a $66 million swap,
and a $33.7 million termination fee to  UBS AG  on Jan. 11 to end
a $108 million contract.  
 In a swap transaction, two parties exchange payments,
typically a  floating  one for a  fixed . State and local
governments usually sold variable-rate bonds and negotiated with
banks to leave them paying fixed interest that was  lower  than
prevailing municipal rates.  
 This week’s offering may include taxable Build America
Bonds, preliminary offering documents show. Average yields on
the federally subsidized securities, the fastest-growing part of
the $2.8 trillion municipal market, fell  10 basis points  last
week to 5.85 percent on July 1, the lowest in three weeks,
according to a Wells Fargo index. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 Gauging Market  
 “We’re looking at BABs,”  John Hanson , chief financial
officer for the DRPA, said in a telephone interview. “But we’re
trying to gauge the strength of the market before we make a
decision.”  
 The bi-state agency, which has no taxing power, plans to
use proceeds from the debt sale to re-deck two bridges, upgrade
commuter train cars for the Port Authority Transit Corp. and
improve railroad tracks, Hanson said.  
 The total supply of available fixed-rate bonds in the next
30 days fell to about  $8.6 billion  last week, about 25 percent
less than the  daily average  of $11.4 billion for the last 18
months, according to the Bloomberg Visible Supply Index.  
 The port authority’s credit outlook was lowered to negative
from stable in March by Moody’s Investors Service. Moody’s and
Standard & Poor’s rate the debt at the fourth-lowest investment
grade, A3 and A- respectively.  
 The securities, backed by transportation revenue, will be
marketed by a group led by  Citigroup Inc.   
 Following are descriptions of pending sales of municipal
debt in the U.S.:  
 MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Maryland, whose Aaa credit rating was
put under review in April for a possible downgrade by Moody’s,
will issue $325 million in bonds through a competitive sale on
July 8 to refinance debt and fund capital projects. About $24
million of the offering will be taxable Recovery Zone Economic
Development securities, with the remainder issued as tax-
exempts. All of the obligations are backed by the full faith and
credit of the county, which was top-rated by S&P, Fitch and
Moody’s in its last sale. (Added July 6)  
 U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS, whose rum shipments to the mainland in
2009 reached 8 million “proof gallons,” a measure for
calculating federal excise taxes, plans to offer about $396
million of tax-exempt debt through its public finance authority
as soon as this week. About $308 million of the issue, backed by
taxes paid by rum producers on shipments to the mainland, is
senior obligations rated BBB+ by Fitch, third-lowest. The
remaining subordinate bonds are rated BBB, second-lowest.
Underwriters led by Jefferies & Co. will market the securities.
(Updated July 6)  
 MISSISSIPPI DEVELOPMENT BANK , created in 1986 by the state
legislature to issue bonds on behalf of local and county
governments, plans to offer about $165 million in tax-exempt
municipal bonds as early as this week to refinance debt. The
bonds, rated AA- by S&P, fourth-highest, and AA by Fitch, one
level higher, will be marketed by a group led by Morgan Stanley.
(Updated July 6)  
 MONROE COUNTY , New York, on the shore of Lake Ontario with
about 735,000 residents, will issue $85 million in tax-exempt
municipal bonds through a competitive sale tomorrow. The debt,
rated BBB+ by S&P, third-lowest, and A2 by Moody’s, fifth-
lowest, will be used for public projects including bridges,
highways and parks. (Updated July 6)
