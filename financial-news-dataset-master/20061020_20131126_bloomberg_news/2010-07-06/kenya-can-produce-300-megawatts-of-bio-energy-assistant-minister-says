             Kenya, whose economy is the biggest
in East Africa, has the potential to produce 300 megawatts of
electricity from agricultural residues such as bagasse from the
sugar industry, Assistant Energy Minister Mohamed Mahamud said.  
 The country, which gets 1 percent of its energy
requirements from renewable sources, produces 38 megawatts from
bagasse, the fiber that remains once juice is extracted from
sugar cane, Mahamud told a Brazilian business and government
delegation, led by President  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva, in
Nairobi, the capital.  
 “It is our desire to learn from the Brazilians best
practices on bio-fuels in addition to other forms of renewable
energy,” he said.  
 Brazil, the world’s biggest exporter of sugar and ethanol
made from cane, has more than doubled output of the biofuel in
the past six years to 27.5 billion liters (7.2 billion gallons)
in 2009, according to industry group Unica.
