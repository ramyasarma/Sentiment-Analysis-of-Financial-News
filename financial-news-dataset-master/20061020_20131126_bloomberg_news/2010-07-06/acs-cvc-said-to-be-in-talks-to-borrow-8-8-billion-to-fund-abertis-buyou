             Abertis Infraestructuras SA ’s two
main shareholders and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. are in talks to
borrow as much as 7 billion euros ($8.8 billion) to fund a
buyout of Spain’s biggest highway operator, according to two
people familiar with the plans.  
 At least 14 banks, including Mediobanca SpA, which is
advising the bidders, UBS AG and Citigroup Inc., plan to lend as
much as 500 million euros each to fund the purchase, according
to the people, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. The financing will be ready by next week, the
people said.  
 Criteria CaixaCorp SA, Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA and CVC are considering a bid for all of Abertis,
ACS and Criteria said in filings to regulators yesterday.
No decision has been made on whether to proceed, said Criteria,
which owns 28.5 percent of Barcelona-based Abertis, and ACS,
which holds 25.8 percent.  
 Under the scenario in which a joint company bids for
Abertis, it would acquire a “very substantial part” of
shareholdings controlled by Criteria and ACS, with a view to
bidding for the rest at the same price it paid for the stock,
Criteria said in its filing.  
 Other banks involved in the financing are French lender
BNP Paribas SA, and Italy’s UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo
SpA, one of the people said.
