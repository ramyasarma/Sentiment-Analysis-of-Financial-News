             Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition
backed higher health-insurance premiums, a move some critics
from her own party said will fail to curb rising health-care
costs and might undermine the German economic recovery.  
 Coalition leaders meeting in Berlin today agreed to raise
health premiums to 15.5 percent of gross pay from 14.9 percent,
Health Minister  Philipp Roesler  said. Employers will contribute
7.3 percent with 8.2 percent paid by employees.  
 “We’re including everybody, workers, employers and
taxpayers,” Roesler said in a statement distributed to
reporters in Berlin.  
 The measure is part of an overhaul of health care intended
to plug an 11-billion euro ($13.8 billion) deficit in the public
health-insurance system in 2011. It follows Cabinet agreement on
June 29 to cuts in spending on drugs to reduce soaring costs to
public health-insurance funds.  
 Only 3.5 billion euros of the total shortfall next year
will be covered by savings in administrative costs at hospitals,
dental practices, through vaccinations and drug prescriptions, a
Health Ministry document shows.  
 Merkel’s government “is taking the path of least
resistance, ducking away from the Herculean tasks in health
services,” Wolfgang Steiger, general secretary of a business
lobby group within Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said in
an e-mailed statement. “The one-sided financing of health costs
via wages has to be stopped.”  
 Higher Surcharges  
 The Christian Democrats, their CSU Bavarian allies and
Roesler’s Free Democrats also agreed to allow health insurers to
levy higher surcharges for health care, paid by the insured
person alone, according to the ministry document. Surcharges
exceeding 2 percent of an insured’s gross pay will be financed
from general tax revenue.  
 “The planned increase in employer contributions not only
contradicts the coalition treaty, but also the most recent
promises of the coalition parties not to raise labor costs any
further,”  Dieter Hundt , head of the BDA employers’ federation,
said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The announcement comes one day before Merkel’s Cabinet
considers plans to slash the budget deficit as Germany seeks to
lead fellow euro-region countries in stemming the spread of
Europe’s debt crisis from Greece.
