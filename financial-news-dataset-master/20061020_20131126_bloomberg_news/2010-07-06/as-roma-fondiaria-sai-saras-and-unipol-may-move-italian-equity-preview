             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index  rose
508.10, or 2.7 percent, to 19,356.66 in Milan, the biggest
increase in more than five weeks.  
 The following stocks are among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM), Italy’s largest independent
fund manager, surged 24.5 cents, or 3.8 percent, to 6.66 euros
as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index ended the longest losing streak in
a year.  
 Buzzi Unicem SpA  (BZU IM) and  Italcementi SpA  (IT IM),
Italy’s biggest cement makers, increased 2.6 percent to 8.2
euros and 4.2 percent to 6.13 euros as industries sensitive to
growth were the best performers in Europe today.  
 Cementir Holding SpA  (CEM IM), the cement maker owned by
Italy’s Caltagirone family, climbed 15 cents, or 7 percent, to
2.28 euros.  
 Enel SpA  (ENEL IM) gained 7.25 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
3.51 euros, erasing yesterday’s decline. Chief Executive Officer
Fulvio Conti said Italy’s biggest utility is “well on its way”
to beating its 2010 earnings forecast and considers October the
“right time” for its renewable-energy unit to sell shares.  
 Fiat SpA  (F IM) increased 22 cents, or 2.7 percent, to 8.33
euros.  
 “We expect original equipment manufacturers and auto parts
companies to report a strong set of second-quarter/first-half
results at the end of July,” Deutsche Bank AG said in a note on
the European automobile industry today. The brokerage cited
“low valuation, a weak second half already anticipated, and a
potentially more resilient earnings/cash performance than
currently anticipated by the market.”  
 Exor Spa  (EXO IM), Fiat’s main shareholder, gained 49
cents, or 3.6 percent, to 13.95 euros.  Pirelli & C. SpA  (PC IM),
Europe’s third-largest tiremaker, advanced 1.4 cents, or 3.1
percent, to 46.25 cents.  
 Fondiaria-Sai SpA  (FSA IM) jumped 42.5 cents, or 5.8
percent, to 7.79 euros, the biggest gain in almost two months.
Nomura Holdings Inc. resumed coverage of Italy’s second biggest
insurer with a “buy” recommendation and a price estimate of 11
euros. The brokerage, which previously rated the stock
“neutral,” said in a note that Fondiaria is “the best option
to gain exposure to a recovery” in the Italian auto insurance
industry because of “its higher gearing to this segment both in
terms of operating earnings and stock performance.”  
 Mediobanca SpA  (MB IM) rose 23.5 cents, or 3.9 percent, to
6.25 euros. Abertis Infraestructuras SA’s two main shareholders
and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. are in talks to borrow as much as
7 billion euros ($8.8 billion) to fund a buyout of Spain’s
biggest highway operator, according to two people familiar with
the plans. Mediobanca is advising the bidders, they said.  
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and UniCredit SpA, Italy’s biggest
lenders, are among banks involved in the financing.  
 Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM), the world’s second-biggest cable
maker, advanced 37 cents, or 3.2 percent, to 12.05 euros, the
highest level in a week. Copper prices jumped the most in a week
as shrinking inventories signaled demand will remain steady even
as global economic growth slows.  
 Saipem SpA  (SPM IM), Europe’s largest oilfield-services
provider, rose 96 cents, or 3.9 percent, to 25.76 euros, erasing
yesterday’s losses as oil rose for the first time in six days.  
 Tenaris SA  (TEN IM), the world’s biggest maker of seamless
steel tubes for oil and gas extraction, gained 51 cents, or 3.7
percent, to 14.46 euros.  
 Telecom Italia SpA  (TIT IM) increased 3.25 cents, or 3.7
percent, to 91.9 cents, ending a five-session loss. Italy’s
biggest phone-company and rivals such as Vodafone Group Plc
should work together to build an ultrafast broadband network in
Italy, the country’s communications regulator said.  
 Phone companies, local governments and entrepreneurs should
cooperate with the aim of upgrading Italy’s copper network to a
fiber-optic grid, the regulator said in an annual report
presented in Rome today.
