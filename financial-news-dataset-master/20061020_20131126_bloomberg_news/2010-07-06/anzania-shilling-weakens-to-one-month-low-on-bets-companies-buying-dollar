             Tanzania’s shilling slumped to its
weakest level in more than a month on speculation companies in
the East African nation were taking advantage of a decline in
the dollar to boost purchases of foreign currency.  
 The shilling weakened as much as 1.5 percent to 1,515 per
dollar, the worst intraday level since May 27, before trading
1.2 percent down at 1,510 by 12:03 p.m. local time.  
 “Corporate demand and interbank speculative dollar
purchasing seem to be the main drivers,” Zintathu Nqweni,
currency trader at Barclays Plc-owned Absa Group Ltd. in
Johannesburg, wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg News. The shilling
may weaken further and a level of 1,530 per dollar may “soon be
tested,” Nqweni wrote.  
 Tanzania’s currency has slumped more than 11 percent this
year against the U.S. currency. The dollar declined as much as
0.6 percent against the euro, trading as weak as 1.2607.
