             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  rose 541.2, or 2.1 percent, to 26,723.87 in
Johannesburg, its biggest gain in three weeks.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, advanced 8.03 rand, or 4.1 percent, to 204.58 rand, its
biggest gain in almost a month.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ)
increased 8.32 rand, or 3.2 percent, to 272.31 rand. Copper rose
for a third day in London as the dollar weakened and inventories
of metal continued to shrink, signaling steady demand.  
 BHP was raised to “buy” from “hold” at Independent
Research GmbH after the local market closed yesterday. Evolution
Securities also raised BHP’s rating to “buy” from “add” July
5.  
 Cie Financiere Richemont SA  (CFR SJ), the world’s second-
largest luxury-goods maker, climbed 88 cents, or 3.3 percent, to
27.79 rand, its biggest jump in nearly a month, which extends
yesterday’s 1.1 percent gain. Hublot, the watch brand owned by
Richemont’s rival LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, had
record first-half sales on Chinese demand and publicity from the
soccer World Cup, Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Claude Biver 
said.  
 Mercantile Bank Holdings Ltd.  (MTL SJ), a banking company,
rose 1 cent, or 4.8 percent, its biggest jump since June 18.
Mercantile deferred talks over selling a 10 percent stake to
“two short listed candidates.”  
 Gold Fields Ltd.  (GFI SJ), Africa’s second-largest gold
producer, dropped for the first time in three days, sliding 3.85
rand, or 3.8 percent, to 97.65 rand. Gold fell in New York,
extending the biggest weekly decline in more than a month, on
speculation that demand will slow after prices touched a record.  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, rose 5.40 rand, or 2 percent, to 281.60 rand,
its highest close since June 21. Oil increased for the first
time in six days as the dollar weakened.
