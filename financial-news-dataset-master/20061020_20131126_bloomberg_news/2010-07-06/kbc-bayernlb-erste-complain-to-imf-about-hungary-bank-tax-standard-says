             KBC Groep NV , Erste Group Bank AG, 
 Raiffeisen International Bank Holding AG , UniCredit SpA, Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA and Bayerische Landesbank have sent letters to the
International Monetary Fund and the Hungarian government 
complaining about the country’s planned banking tax, Der 
Standard newspaper reported, citing the letters.  
 While the banks had promised to maintain their 
“engagement” in eastern European countries at a pre-crisis 
level, this may become difficult when faced with the tax, 
Standard cited an unidentified spokesman of an Austrian bank as
saying.  
 The tax aims at raising 650 million euros ($817 million), 
the Vienna-based newspaper said. Banks will be taxed with 0.45 
percent of their balance sheets, insurers with 5.2 percent, 
Standard said.
