             Midtown Manhattan office rents for
the best-quality space were little changed at the end of the
second quarter as landlords offered leases for more than a third
off the amount they asked for in 2008.  
 The average rent sought for so-called Class A space in
Midtown fell 0.2 percent to $63.24 a square foot at the end of
June compared with March 31, New York-based property broker
 Studley  Inc. said in a draft report.  
 Slowing price declines may signal a bottom for Midtown’s
office  market , where the collapse of financial firms such as
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. helped spark
a 37 percent drop in Class A rents since the first quarter of
2008, according to Studley data.  
 “The steep part of the decline is in the rearview
window,” said  Steve Coutts , Studley senior vice president for
research.  
 About 13.1 percent of Class A Midtown space was available,
down from 13.8 percent at the end of the previous quarter and
from 15.1 percent a year earlier.  
 In Midtown’s Plaza District, the neighborhood east of Fifth
Avenue with the highest rents in the U.S., Class A space
availability fell to 11.6 percent at the end of the second
quarter from 13.2 percent three months earlier.  
 Rents in the area rose 5.7 percent to $61.80 a square foot,
Studley statistics show.  
 “The Plaza is almost a market unto itself,” Coutts said
in a telephone interview. “With the exception of prime Class A
space in Midtown, we’re probably going to be bouncing along the
bottom for quite some time -- until we see significant, true  job
growth .”  
 Financial Pullback  
 Financial firms are accounting for a smaller share of
signed leases in Midtown, Studley said.  
 The market lacks a “white knight” industry to help boost
rents or occupancies the way hedge funds did in the mid-2000s
and information-technology firms did in the late 1990s, Coutts
said.  
 Class A rents in lower Manhattan dropped 1.1 percent to
$43.72 a square foot, the eighth straight quarter of declines.
Companies such as Merrill Lynch & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and American International Group Inc. may leave additional space
downtown, Coutts said.  
 Downtown’s Class A office availability rose to 11.3 percent
at the end of June from 10.8 percent three months earlier and 8
percent a year earlier.  
 “There’s a significant amount of space on the edge,”
Coutts said. “There’s a large enough quantity of space
potentially in the market that could spike the availability  rate 
downtown by four or five percentage points.”
