             SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd. , an
Indian company that invests in power, road and port projects,
plans to raise $1 billion overseas to fund infrastructure
development in Asia’s third-largest economy.  
 The company, based in Kolkata, will also raise 10 billion
rupees ($214 million) for a domestic fund, Chairman and Managing
Director  Hemant Kanoria  said in New Delhi today, without
providing additional details.  
 SREI Infrastructure joins companies including Australia’s
 Macquarie Group Ltd.  and London-based  3i Group Plc  in aiming to
tap investment opportunities in a nation that has doubled its
target for infrastructure spending to $1 trillion in the five
years starting 2012.  
 Shares of SREI climbed 1.4 percent to 82.6 rupees at the
close of trading in Mumbai. The stock has gained 6.2 percent
this year, surpassing a less than 1 percent advance in the
benchmark  Sensitive Index .  
 SREI, which offers equipment-leasing, project financing and
advisory services, is part of groups of companies that have been
awarded 54.7 billion rupees in orders for the development of
highways in India last year, according to a May  press release .  
 In April 2009, State Bank of India, the nation’s largest
lender, and Sydney-based Macquarie set up a $1 billion
infrastructure fund. In 2008, 3i Group raised $1.2 billion for
its India infrastructure fund.  
 India, ranked below war-ravaged Ivory Coast and Sri Lanka
for the quality of infrastructure, in May said it plans to set
up a 500 billion rupee debt fund to build ports, roads and
bridges.  
 India spent 6.5 percent of its  gross domestic product  in
2009 on infrastructure, compared with about 11 percent by China,
according to an Ernst & Young India report. Failure to lift
investment may imperil Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s target of
boosting economic growth to the 10 percent needed to pull 828
million people living on less than $2 per day out of poverty.
