             China, the world’s biggest polluter,
needs to pick up the pace of increasing the nation’s capacity to
produce power from renewable energy sources for 2020 targets to
be met, a government official said.  
 The country must increase the pace of capacity expansion by
50 percent, Li Zuojun, vice director of resources and
environment at the State Council’s development research center,
said at a conference in Shanghai today.  
 China aims to boost the share of non-fossil fuels in its
primary energy consumption to 15 percent by 2020 to rely less on
more polluting sources such as coal. The 2020 renewable energy
capacity targets include an installed capacity of 100 gigawatts
of windpower and 20 gigawatts of solar units,  Zhang Guobao , head
of the National Energy Administration, said in May.  
 The government may publish a plan to develop renewable
energy by 2020 “very soon,” Li said in an interview. A draft
of the plan is pending approval from the State Council, he said.
Companies operating power grids will be required to buy all
electricity generated by renewable energy, he said.  
 High costs and technical difficulty are the major barriers
faced by producers of electricity from renewable energy, Li said.  
 The cost of production for wind power is about 8,000 yuan
($1,179) to 9,000 yuan a kilowatt, while the on-grid price for
electricity produced by wind power is 0.5 to 0.6 yuan a
kilowatt-hour, according to Li.  
 Solar power costs about 18,000 yuan a kilowatt while the
on-grid tariff is about 1 yuan a kilowatt-hour, he said.  
 The government will increase investment in a renewable-
energy fund that will compensate grid operators for the higher
cost of electricity purchases, Li said.
