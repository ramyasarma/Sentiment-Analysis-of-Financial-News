             Democrats in the  New Jersey  Assembly
haven’t signed off on the agreement reached between Governor
 Chris Christie  and lawmakers in the Senate on a plan to limit
growth in the state’s property taxes.  
 Assembly Majority Leader  Joseph Cryan , a Union Democrat,
said the party’s 47 members will meet tomorrow in Trenton to
take a position on the proposal and set a timeframe to act on
it. Cryan, 48, declined to say whether the plan will pass the
lower house.  
 Democrats passed the state’s current 4 percent cap on the
rise of property taxes, and most lawmakers see the 2 percent
limit Christie and Senate President  Stephen Sweeney  announced
this weekend as a “next step,” Cryan said. Assembly Speaker
 Sheila Oliver  said July 3 she wasn’t involved in drafting that
proposal and hasn’t endorsed it. Oliver didn’t respond to
attempts to reach her through her Trenton office.  
 “We haven’t signed off yet,” Cryan said today in a
telephone interview. “We’re going to vet it and talk to our
members. We’re going to work on our timeframe.”  
 Christie, a Republican who took office Jan. 19, and the
Democrat-led Legislature have disagreed over how to rein in the
state’s property taxes, which are the highest in the U.S. at an
 average  of $7,281 in 2009, up 72 percent since 1999.  
 Weekend Agreement  
 The governor, 47, had called for a constitutional amendment
capping annual growth in the levies at 2.5 percent and allowing
communities to exceed it only for bond payments or through a
referendum. Christie dropped that demand and agreed to more
exemptions after facing resistance from legislators.  
 Under the pact, the tax increases would be capped at 2
percent with exemptions for rising health-insurance costs, bond
payments, natural disasters and pension costs, Christie told
reporters July 3 in Trenton. Communities also would be able to
exceed the cap with the approval of a simple majority of voters
in a public referendum.  
 The governor sent the plan to the Legislature today when he
conditionally vetoed a 2.9 percent cap lawmakers approved last
week. Christie sent it back to them with an agreement to enact
it if they approve the changes in last week’s accord. Sweeney
said the agreement would get a July 8 vote in the Senate.  
 “Now is the time to act, not hesitate,” Christie said in
a statement. “The stakes are too high for New Jersey families
who are struggling to make ends meet and fighting to stay in
their own homes to delay any longer in providing real,
meaningful property-tax relief.”
