             Codelco contract workers at its
Ventanas copper smelter in central Chile went on strike after
failing to reach an agreement over pay, a union official said.  
 The strike involving more than 100 workers began today and
disrupted deliveries to ports, Luciano Huerta, the treasurer of
Chile’s Copper Workers Confederation, known as CTC, said by
telephone. The smelter continues to operate normally during the
strike, a company official briefed on the matter said in an e-
mailed response to questions.  
 “We are going to continue until the company presents a new
proposal,” Huerta said from the smelter. Wage talks resumed
earlier today, the Codelco official said.  
 Ventanas , one of Codelco’s six divisions, produced 384,819
metric tons of refined copper last year. The division exports
copper through the ports of Quintero and Valparaiso, also
located in on Chile’s central coast. State-owned Codelco is the
world’s largest copper producer.
