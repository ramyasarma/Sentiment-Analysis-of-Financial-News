             Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
largest automaker, received complaints more than three years ago
about engine problems that sparked recalls this week of more
than 100,000 Lexus and Toyota vehicles in Asia.  
 The carmaker received the first customer complaints in
March 2007 in Japan regarding defective valve springs that may
cause engines to stall, Toyota spokeswoman  Ririko Takeuchi  said
by phone today from Tokyo.  
 The problem occurs when foreign substances enter the
material used to make the part, causing the spring to weaken and
break, Tokyo-based spokeswoman  Monika Saito  said. While Toyota
decided to address the problem in August 2008 by altering the
design of the valve spring and making it thicker, the company
didn’t feel that a recall was necessary given the rarity of the
problem at the time, she said.  
 Toyota is working to restore its reputation for quality
after  recalling  about 8 million vehicles globally for defects
linked to unintended acceleration. The company recalled about
13,000 Lexus GX 460 sport-utility vehicles in April after
Consumer Reports labeled the model a “safety risk” because it
could roll over. The designation was removed in May.  
 The company will recall 91,903 Lexus GS 350, GS 450h, GS
460, IS 350, LS 460, LS 600h and LS 600hL models and some Toyota
Crown cars in Japan, the nation’s transportation ministry said
in a statement on its website yesterday. Recalls have been
announced in China and South Korea, and the problem may affect
as many as 270,000 vehicles worldwide, Toyota has said.  
 Toyota received 220 complaints in Japan and 210 from
overseas, Saito said. The company decided to initiate a recall
after acknowledging a rising trend in the complaints, she said.  
 U.S. Regulators  
 The recall in Japan covers cars built between July 2005 and
August 2008. The automaker will notify U.S. regulators of a
recall this week, Toyota said on July 2. About 138,000 vehicles
in the U.S. may be affected, according to the Toyota City,
Japan-based company.  
 Toyota, which paid a record U.S. fine of $16.4 million this
year for not complying with auto-safety regulations, said on
June 25 it would recall the Lexus HS 250h sedan after too much
gasoline spilled in U.S. government crash tests, posing a fire
risk.
