             South Africa’s rand strengthened the
most in more than a month against the dollar as gains in stocks
worldwide boosted investor appetite for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  
 The rand appreciated as much as 1.4 percent to 7.6406 per
dollar, the steepest climb since May 27, before trading 1.2
percent stronger at 7.6539 by 2:36 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a
close of 7.7458 yesterday. Against the euro, the rand gained 0.7
percent to 9.6339.  
 “Stronger stocks will feed through to the rand from a
sentiment point of view, no question,”  Ian Martin , a currency
strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg. “That’s the
main reason but it helps that the dollar is a bit weaker.”  
 Asian stocks rose, driving up the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
by the most in two weeks, while equities in Europe also gained
as investors bet equities had become cheap relative to earnings
prospects. A benchmark measure of emerging-market stocks also
gained on bets investors were taking advantage of recent losses
to boost purchases of equities that will benefit from a global
economic recovery.  
 “The rand has started to firm again, in keeping with the
rally in Asian equity markets and the slightly weaker dollar,”
 Michael Keenan , a currency strategist at  Standard Bank Group
Ltd.  in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note.  
 Government bonds advanced in South Africa with the
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rising 23
cents to 123.54 rand. The yield on the bond fell 5 basis points
to 7.88 percent.  
 Investors increased bets the central bank will lower its
6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next meets on July
22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month
contracts  for cash in three months fell 1 basis point to 6.36
percent, equaling the 6 1/2-year low reached on April 21.
