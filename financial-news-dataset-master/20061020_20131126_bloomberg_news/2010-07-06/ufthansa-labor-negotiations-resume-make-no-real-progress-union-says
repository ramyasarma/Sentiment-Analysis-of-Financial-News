             Deutsche Lufthansa AG  and labor
leaders are making “no real progress” in talks on working
conditions and bonuses for ground employees and cabin crews, the
Ver.di union said.  
 Discussions resumed today at 8 a.m. in Frankfurt after a
round that started yesterday was suspended after midnight,
 Christoph Schmitz , a spokesman for Ver.di, said in a phone
interview. The possibility of a strike hasn’t been discussed,
Schmitz said, declining to specify the union’s next steps should
negotiations break down by the end of the day.  
 Ver.di  is representing 50,000 employees in the talks, which
began earlier this year and also cover workers at the cargo and
maintenance units of Cologne, Germany-based  Lufthansa , Europe’s
second-biggest airline. The union rejected the carrier’s
contract offer as “absolutely insufficient and unacceptable”
in a fourth round of negotiations in June.  
 Claudia Lange , a spokeswoman for Lufthansa in Frankfurt,
declined to comment on the discussions.
