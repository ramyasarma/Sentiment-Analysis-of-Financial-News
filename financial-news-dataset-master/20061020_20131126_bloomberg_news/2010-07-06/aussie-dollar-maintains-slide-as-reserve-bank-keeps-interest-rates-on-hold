             Australia’s dollar maintained
declines after the central bank left interest rates unchanged
for a second month amid financial-market concerns that Europe’s
debt crisis may slow global economic growth.  
 The so-called Aussie traded at 83.62 U.S. cents as of 2:32
p.m. in Sydney, from 83.70 cents before the Reserve Bank of
Australia’s decision and 83.93 cents yesterday in New York.
