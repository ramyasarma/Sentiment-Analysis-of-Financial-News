             Israeli five-year interest-rate swaps
may fall to 3.5 percent as the central bank holds its benchmark
lending rate until October, according to Barclays Capital.  
 “While the Bank of Israel will likely continue to
gradually tighten monetary policy, a moderating inflation rate
as well as a more fickle global environment suggests a slower
pace of rate hikes,”  Daniel Hewitt , a London-based senior
economist at Barclays, said yesterday in an interview. The
central bank “is particularly sensitive about the global risk
environment.”  
 Hewitt recommends receiving five-year interest rate swaps
under current conditions as investors lock-in fixed payments on
bets floating rates will decline as the central bank slows the
pace of interest rate increases.  
 The  five-year swap rate , or cost to fix five-year payments,
started climbing in early 2009, before interest rates rose to
the current 1.5 percent level. The rate was at 3.64 percent
yesterday, according to Bloomberg data, declining about 90 basis
points from the 4.53 percent peak in January on bets the pace of
rate increases would slow on concern the global economic
recovery is faltering.  
 Fischer held the benchmark interest rate on June 28 for a
third month as economic growth slowed to 3.6 percent in the
first quarter from 4.5 percent the previous three months. Export
data have been lower than expected and there is some concern
that economic growth this year may be below the Bank of Israel’s
3.7 percent forecast, Fischer said July 1.  
 The Finance Ministry on June 6 lowered its growth forecast
to 3.6 percent, citing the debt crisis in Europe, Israel’s main
export market along with the U.S.
