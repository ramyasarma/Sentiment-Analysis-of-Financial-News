             The ruble gained against the dollar,
recovering yesterday’s losses, as crude oil above $72 a barrel
bolstered the earnings outlook for the world’s biggest energy
exporter.  
 The Russian currency added 0.2 percent to 31.0802 per
dollar by 12:26 p.m. in Moscow. The yield on Russia’s benchmark
dollar bond due 2020 fell 2 basis points to 5.471 percent.  
 Crude for August delivery was up 25 cents at $72.39 a
barrel, reversing earlier losses and rising for the first day in
six as Asian equities gained and the dollar weakened, increasing
the appeal of commodities as an investment.  
 Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.2738
per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of 31.3345
yesterday. The contracts are a guide to expectations of currency
movements as they allow foreign investors and companies to fix
the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The currency weakened 0.2 percent to 39.1099 per euro,
leaving it little changed at 34.7031 against the central bank’s
 target  currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
