             South Africa’s government is
concerned by rising wage demands as state employees threaten to
strike for higher pay, Deputy Finance Minister  Nhlanhla Nene 
said.  
 An increased wage bill may reduce government funds used for
job-creation projects, worsening  unemployment , Nene said in an
interview in Johannesburg today.  
 Public sector workers, including teachers and nurses, may
go on strike after the government offered to raise wages by 6.5
percent, short of the 8.6 percent demanded by unions. Employees
of state-owned transport company Transnet Ltd. set a precedent
in May by winning an 11 percent wage increase after an 18-day
strike that crippled the country’s exports.  
 “From the government’s side, we are trying to contain the
wage bill,” Nene said. “If more money goes into wages of
existing workers, then there’s little money left to create
jobs.”  
 Eskom Holdings Ltd., the state-owned power utility, on July
4 offered workers a 9 percent pay increase, almost double the
country’s May  inflation  rate of 4.6 percent.  
 South Africa’s unemployment rate of 25.2 percent is the
highest of 62 countries tracked by Bloomberg. The  economy  shed
79,000 jobs in the formal, non-agricultural industry in the
first quarter, even as economic growth accelerated to an
annualized 4.6 percent in the same period.  
 Rising wages may undermine a government pledge to cut the
jobless rate to 14 percent by 2014.
