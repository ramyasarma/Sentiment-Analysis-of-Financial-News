             Verbund AG , Austria’s biggest
utility, appointed Morgan Stanley as joint bookrunner for its
proposed 1 billion-euro ($1.26 billion) share sale, the bank
said in a note to investors today.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Wolfgang Anzengruber  said June 30
that the Vienna-based company was seeking shareholder approval
for the sale at a Sept. 1 meeting. Depending on market
conditions, the sale may be carried out by November or December,
he said.  
 “We are in talks with several investment banks, but have
yet to make a decision,” Beate McGinn, a spokeswoman at Verbund
in Vienna, said by phone.  
 The utility is following National Grid Plc and EVN AG in
seeking funds by selling stock. National Grid, the operator of
the U.K.’s power and gas networks, in May announced plans to
raise 3.2 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) in a rights offering,
while EVN, Austria’s second-biggest utility, said last month
that it plans to raise about 200 million euros.  
 “On our estimates, the announced 1 billion-euro offering
would reduce 2011 economic net debt to EBITDA from 4.5x to
3.6x,”  Sean Lee , an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, wrote
in today’s note. “This would sit more comfortably with the
company’s A- credit rating.”
