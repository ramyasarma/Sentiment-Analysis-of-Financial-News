             Balfour Beatty Plc said it expects
its order book to be ahead of the 14.1 billion pounds it
reported in December even as it sees “uncertainties” in some
parts of its markets, “particularly with regard to government
funding of infrastructure investment.”  
 The company commented in a statement distributed by the
Regulatory News Service today.
