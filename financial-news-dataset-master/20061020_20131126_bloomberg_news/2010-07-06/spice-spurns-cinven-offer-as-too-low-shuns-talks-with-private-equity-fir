             Spice Plc , the U.K.’s biggest reader
of water meters, rejected a revised offer from private equity
firm Cinven Ltd., saying it undervalued the company.  
 “The Group is now streamlined, and its cost base and net
debt levels have been reduced,” said Chief Executive Officer
 Martin Towers  in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News
Service today. “The management team is focused on exploiting
the platform that has been created.”  
 Spice said its board has not entered into talks with Cinven
which improved its offer to between 62 pence and 65 pence per
share from 56 pence in May. Spice closed 1.9 percent higher at
54 pence per share yesterday, giving the company a market value
of 190 million pounds ($288 million).  
 In a separate statement, Spice reported a net loss of 56.2
million pounds for the year ended April 30, from a profit of
17.2 million pounds, a year earlier. Revenue fell 11 percent to
310.7 million pounds, said the Leeds, England-based company.  
 Spice disposed of its telecom and gas units in April and
June.
