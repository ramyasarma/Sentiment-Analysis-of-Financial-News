             Malaysia’s recovery may slow in the
second half of this year, Prime Minister  Najib Razak  said, as
risks to global growth increase ahead of this week’s central
bank decision on interest rates.  
 “There might be a possible second-half slowdown in the
economy due to external factors,” Najib said in a speech in
Putrajaya, outside Kuala Lumpur. “Therefore, it’s important for
us to have robust domestic demand to spur and balance the
economy.”  
 Bank Negara Malaysia’s monetary policy committee will
decide on July 8 whether to increase its  overnight policy rate 
for a third time this year. Rising  exports  and production helped
Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy expand at the fastest
pace in a decade in the first quarter, allowing the central bank
to raise borrowing costs ahead of most of its Asian neighbors.  
 The  economy  grew 10.1 percent in the three months ended
March 31 after emerging from last year’s recession. It may
expand 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent in 2010, the  central bank 
forecast on March 24.  
 Najib’s remarks today “reduce the likelihood of monetary
tightening this week,”  Dariusz Kowalczyk , a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, said in an e-mail to
Bloomberg News today. “We continue to expect the central bank
to stay put.”
