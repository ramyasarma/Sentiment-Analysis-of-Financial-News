             KKR & Co.  said its shares will start
trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 15, ending a
three-year-old journey to take the buyout firm public in its
home town.  
 The company, founded by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts ,
will be listed under the ticker KKR, according to a statement
today.  Trading  of KKR Guernsey in Amsterdam will end July 14.
KKR, which has filed a registration statement to sell additional
shares, said today that such a move would only happen after its
New York listing is completed and will be “subject to market
conditions.”  
 KKR initially filed to sell shares weeks before the global
credit crisis crippled equity and debt markets in 2007. The firm
scrapped that plan, opting to merge with its publicly traded
European fund, a combination that was completed last year. A
U.S. listing clears the way for KKR to issue additional stock
and enables firm insiders to eventually cash out their stakes if
they so choose.  
 The firm said earlier today that its founders will own 25
percent of the company, a stake valued at about $1.6 billion at
the current share price.  Stephen Schwarzman  owns 21 percent of
rival  Blackstone Group LP , which he co-founded in 1985 and took
public in June 2007.  Leon Black , who built Apollo Global
Management LLC, owns 26 percent of the firm, which also plans to
lists shares on the NYSE.  
 Apollo’s Plans  
 Apollo, which trades on a private system run by  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. , in November revived that plan after it had
been delayed by the financial crisis. The New York-based company
filed in March to raise $50 million in connection with the
listing.  
 Unlike Blackstone, KKR’s founders have no plans to sell
their shares. Schwarzman and Blackstone co-founder Peter G.
Peterson pocketed a combined $2.6 billion in the New York-based
firm’s initial public offering before deal markets froze. The
stock has dropped 70 percent since the IPO.  
 Kravis and Roberts both got about $22 million in
distributions last year, which includes their share of the fees
collected and $500,000 in carried interest. Regulators also
required the firm to disclose valuation gains from a
reorganization of the firm, which amounted to $70.5 million.  
 KKR rose 14 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $9.44 in Amsterdam
trading. The shares are up 11 percent this year.
