             Australia’s opposition Liberal-
National coalition leader Tony Abbott will toughen asylum seeker
policy, including turning back boats containing those seeking
refugee status and processing those applications offshore, if he
wins government at an election this year. Abbott commented in an
e-mailed statement.
