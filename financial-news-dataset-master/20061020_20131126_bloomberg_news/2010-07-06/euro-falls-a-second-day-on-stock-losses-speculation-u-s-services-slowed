             The euro fell for a second day
against the dollar and the yen as a decline in Asian stocks and
speculation growth in U.S. service industries slowed spurred
demand for safer assets.  
 The euro dropped to $1.2494 as of 9:24 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.2538 yesterday. The 16-nation currency weakened to 109.33 yen
from 110.05.
