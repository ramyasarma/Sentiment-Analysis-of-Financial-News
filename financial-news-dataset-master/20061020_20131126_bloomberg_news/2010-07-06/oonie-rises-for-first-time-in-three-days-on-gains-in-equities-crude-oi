             Canada’s dollar appreciated versus
its U.S. counterpart for the first time in three days after an
advance in global equities and commodities including copper made
currencies tied to growth more attractive.  
 The Canadian currency’s decline on June 30 capped its first
quarterly drop in more than a year as Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis and a faltering economic recovery in North America
increased refuge demand for the greenback and yen.  
 “The risk-off trade was at an extreme last week,”  John Curran , senior vice president at CanadianForex Ltd., an online
foreign-exchange dealer, said by phone from Toronto. He linked
the trades to some expectations for a “double-dip” recession.
“Those fears are overstated at this point,” Curran said.  
 The currency strengthened as much as 1.4 percent, the most
on an intraday basis since June 10, to C$1.0486 per U.S. dollar,
before trading at C$1.0545 at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It closed at
C$1.0634 yesterday, after it touched C$1.0677, the weakest level
since June 7. One Canadian dollar buys 94.84 U.S. cents.  
 The Canadian dollar will trade between C$1.02 and C$1.08
during the next three months, Curran said, and advised: “Play
those ranges until they break.”  
 The MSCI World Index, a measure of stocks in 24 developed
nations, climbed 1.7 percent. September copper futures advanced
1.9 percent. The loonie, as Canada’s currency is known, tends to
rise and fall with stocks and commodity prices.  
 Range Found  
 The Canadian currency weakened to almost C$1.0680 during
the past four sessions before being rebuffed, suggesting the
level is forming “good resistance” for the U.S. dollar versus
the Canadian, said  Jonathan Gencher , director of foreign
exchange sales at Bank of Montreal. Resistance refers to the
upper boundary of a trading range, where sell orders may be
clustered.  
 The C$1.0550 level “should still provide initial
support,” Toronto-based Gencher wrote today in a note to
clients. The currency pair “is not likely to deviate much from
its current range ahead of the Bank of Canada’s rate
announcement on July 20,” he said.  
 In June, Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  became the
first Group of Seven central banker to raise interest rates,
increasing the Bank of Canada’s target level to 0.5 percent from
a record low of 0.25 percent. Policy makers meet again on July
20 and in September, October and December.  
 Bond Sale  
 Canadian government bonds were little changed. The 10-year
note rose 5 cents to C$103.64 and yielded 3.07 percent.  
 The Bank of Canada tomorrow will sell C$3 billion ($2.9
billion) of 2 percent bonds maturing in September 2012. The
central bank’s June 2 auction of two-year notes drew an average
yield of 1.928 percent, and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.395,
according to  data  on the bank’s website.  
 Canada’s dollar stayed higher, even after a Statistics
Canada report showed building permits tumbled 10.8 percent, the
most since February 2009, to C$5.98 billion. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News predicted a 2 percent decline, based on the
median of 13 responses. The value of permits has fallen in five
of the past seven months.
