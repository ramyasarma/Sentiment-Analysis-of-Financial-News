-- Services in U.S. Probably Grew at Slower Pace, Signaling Growth Is Cooling

             Service industries in the U.S.
expanded in June at a slower pace, indicating the economy
started to cool entering the second half, economists said before
a report today.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s  index  of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 55 from 55.4 in May, according to the median
forecast of 59 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Readings
above 50 signal expansion.  
 Companies such as  Bed Bath and Beyond Inc.  may find it
harder to boost sales without faster job growth as government
stimulus wanes. Private hiring last month rose less than
forecast and consumer confidence plunged, indicating the
recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s remains
vulnerable.  
 “Given the headwind from slower private payrolls,
consumers are going to spend cautiously,” said  Michael Gregory ,
a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “We still
have a recovery, but it’ll probably be a little more sluggish.”  
 The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM’s report is due at 10 a.m. in
New York. Bloomberg survey estimates ranged from 52 to 56.6.  
 The figures on services follow reports last week that
showed a slowdown in manufacturing and weakness in housing, at
the same time Europe grapples with a debt crisis and China tries
to slow its economy.  
 Employment at companies rose 83,000 last month, less than
the 110,000 increase forecast by economists in a Bloomberg
survey, Labor Department figures showed on July 2. Including
government, payrolls fell for the first time this year because
of a drop in federal census workers. The  jobless rate  fell to
9.5 percent from 9.7 percent as the labor force shrank.  
 Consumer Confidence  
 The outlook for jobs is one reason consumer  confidence  sank
more than forecast in June, according to a Conference Board
report last week. It raises the risk household spending, which
accounts for about 70 percent of the economy, will falter.  
 Bed Bath & Beyond, a Union, New Jersey-based retailer, last
month forecast current-quarter and annual earnings that trailed
analysts’ estimates.  
 “It appears the consumer continues to face economic
challenges, and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment
still persist,”  Leonard Feinstein , the company’s co-chairman,
said on a conference call on June 23.  
 Auto Sales  
 Concerns about unemployment and reluctance to make large
purchases were also reflected last week in lower-than-
anticipated auto sales in June for General Motors Co. and  Ford
Motor Co. , the two largest U.S. automakers.  
 The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Retailing  Index  has
fallen 22 percent since a 19-month peak on April 26, compared
with a 16 percent decline in the broader S&P 500  gauge  from its
19-month peak on April 23.  
 The ISM services survey covers industries that range from
utilities and retailing to health care, housing and finance.  
 Housing, which helped trigger the recession, is showing
signs of renewed weakness following the end of a government tax
credit of as much as $8,000. The absence of faster job growth
and rising foreclosures are depressing property prices.  
 Economic data in recent weeks and Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis underscore why Federal Reserve policy makers renewed a
pledge last month to keep interest rates near a record low.
Central bankers said the recovery is “likely to be moderate for
a time,” according to their statement. Consumer spending still
“remains constrained” by joblessness and “tight credit,”
they said.  
 Services have been lagging behind manufacturing, which led
the economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009. The ISM
reported on July 1 that  factories  expanded in June at the
slowest pace this year as orders and exports cooled, adding to
concern financial-market turmoil sparked by Europe’s debt
problems will hurt global growth.

                          July 2 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, discusses the outlook for employment and the potential implications of an offshore oil drilling moratorium for his home state.
     Payrolls declined by 125,000 last month as the government cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010 census, Labor Department figures showed. Employment at companies rose 83,000. The jobless rate fell to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent. Brady talks with Margaret Brennan on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness.” (Source: Bloomberg)
