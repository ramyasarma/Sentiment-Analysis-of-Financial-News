             Andy Pettitte  of the New York Yankees
will replace the injured  Clay Buchholz  as an American League
pitcher for the July 13 All-Star Game, Major League Baseball
said today in a news release.  
 Pettitte, 38, who is 10-2 with a 2.82 earned run average
this season, will be on his third All-Star team. He also was
chosen in 1996 and 2001.  
 Buchholz, 25, of the Boston Red Sox, is on the 15-day
disabled list because of a strained left hamstring.  
 Buchholz was selected by his fellow players. Pettitte was
the automatic choice to replace him since he was the highest-
ranking pitcher in player votes who didn’t make the original
roster.
