             Japan Prime Minister Naoto Kan
suggested the government may raise income tax for high-income
earners, the Nikkei newspaper reported, citing comments made on
television yesterday.  
 Kan said the tax system’s income redistribution needed to
be made more effective if the rate of consumption tax was
increased, the report said. The government is considering
raising the 40 percent rate for income of more than 18 million
yen ($206,000), the Nikkei said.
