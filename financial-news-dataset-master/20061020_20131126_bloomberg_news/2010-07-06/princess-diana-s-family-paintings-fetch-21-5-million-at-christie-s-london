             Two paintings from the collection of
the U.K.’s aristocratic Spencer family raised 14.2 million
pounds ($21.5 million) at an Old Master auction last night as
highly valued artworks attracted selective bidding.  
 Peter Paul Rubens’s 1612-1614 panel painting “A Commander
Being Armed for a Battle” sold at  Christie’s International  for
9 million pounds with fees, while Guercino’s 1651 canvas “King
David” fetched 5.2 million pounds, a record for the artist.  
 Both works from the Princess of Wales’s family sold near
their lower estimates. Last month, high-value Impressionist and
contemporary works often struggled to attract bidding as buyers,
mindful of wider economic concerns, balked at rising estimates.
