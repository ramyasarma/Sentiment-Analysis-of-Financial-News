             A U.K. index of hiring for permanent
jobs fell in June to a five-month low, KPMG LLP and the
Recruitment and Employment Confederation said.  
 The gauge of full-time job placements dropped to 60.7 from
61.3 in May, the groups said in an e-mailed report today. That’s
the lowest reading since January. A gauge of demand for
temporary staff dropped to 57 from 59.2. Readings above 50
indicates an increase in hiring.  
 The report suggests the labor market may be losing steam
even before Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government enacts the
deepest public spending cuts since World War II. Some 610,000
jobs will be eliminated in the public sector in the next five
years due to the budget squeeze, the government’s new Office for
Budget Responsibility said last week.  
 “Demand for workers across all sectors continued to rise
in June,” Bernard Brown, head of business services at KPMG,
said in the statement. “The proposed public-sector cuts have
not yet had an impact on the U.K. jobs market. However, it can
now be only a matter of time.”
