             Emirates, the biggest Arab airline,
will operate a one-time Airbus A380 service to New Delhi from
Dubai on July 15 to celebrate the opening of a new terminal in
the Indian capital, the airline said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Emirates has no immediate plan to start regular A380
service to New Delhi, said a spokeswoman for the Dubai-based
airline who declined to be identified because of company policy.  
 India’s civil aviation regulator said June 25 it received
Emirates’ request to fly the superjumbo aircraft to New Delhi.
