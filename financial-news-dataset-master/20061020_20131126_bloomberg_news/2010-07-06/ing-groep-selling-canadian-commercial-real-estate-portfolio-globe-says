             ING Groep NV,  the biggest Dutch
financial-services company, is selling a portfolio of warehouses
and industrial properties in Canada to bolster its balance
sheet, the Globe and Mail reported.  
 ING purchased the properties of Summit Real Estate
Investment Trust for C$2.1 billion ($1.98 billion) four years
ago, the newspaper said. The sale, arranged through TD
Securities, could reach up to C$2 billion, the Globe said.  
 ING was hoping to close the sale by June, although it’s
taking longer as possible buyers are trying to find financing,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified people.
