             Liberia’s foreign remittance inflows
rose $19.5 million to $234.8 million in the first quarter,
compared with the last three months of 2009, the Central Bank of
Liberia said in an e-mailed bulletin released Monday.
 The West African nation recovering from 14 years of civil war
that ended in 2003, reported foreign trade increased 13 percent
to $162.7 million in the first quarter, from the fourth quarter
of 2009.  
 Total export proceeds were $55.1 million and import
expenditures were $107.6 million, leading to a trade deficit of
$52.5 million in the first quarter of 2010.   
 “The persistent trade deficit position of the economy
suggests that there is a need for diversification of the export
sector with emphasis on active logging, iron ore, cocoa and
coffee activities,” the Monrovia-based bank said.
