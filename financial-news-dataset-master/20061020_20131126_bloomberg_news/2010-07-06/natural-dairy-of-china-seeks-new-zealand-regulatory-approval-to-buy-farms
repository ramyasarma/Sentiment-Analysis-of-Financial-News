             Natural Dairy (NZ) Holdings Ltd., a
Chinese company that wants to buy farms in New Zealand, has
lodged an application with foreign investment regulators for
approval to buy properties known as the Crafar farms.  
 The proposal sent to the  Overseas Investment Office  today
will generate jobs and export opportunities, Natural Dairy said
in an e-mailed statement. The 16 farms were owned by Crafar
family interests before their company was placed in receivership
in October.  
 In May, receivers  Michael Stiassny  and Brendon Gibson of
KordaMentha agreed a sale with UBNZ Funds Management Ltd., a New
Zealand company associated with Natural Dairy, conditional on
consent from regulators. The receivers continued to seek other
buyers and the deadline for bids is tomorrow.  
 Landcorp Farming Ltd., a New Zealand government-owned
company that runs 105 local beef, sheep, deer and dairy farms,
yesterday said it will make a bid, the New Zealand Herald
 reported , citing Chief Executive Officer Chris Kelly.  
 “Natural Dairy is confident it offers the best return to
creditors of Crafar farms,” Vice Chairman Graham Chin said in
the statement. No details of the bid were revealed.  
 Prime Minister  John Key  this week said sales of “very
large tracts of land” to foreign owners may not be in the long-
term interests of New Zealand, the Dominion Post reported. The
final decision on recommendations from the regulator rests with
Land Information Minister  Maurice Williamson  and Conservation
Minister  Kate Wilkinson .
