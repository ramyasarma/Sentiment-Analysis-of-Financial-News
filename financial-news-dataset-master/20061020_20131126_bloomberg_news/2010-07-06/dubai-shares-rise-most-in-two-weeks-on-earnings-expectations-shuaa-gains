             Dubai shares increased the most in
more than two weeks, helping gains in Gulf Arab markets, on
investor speculation that recent declines are overdone given
prospects for earnings growth. Crude oil advanced.  
 Emaar Properties PJSC , developer of the world’s tallest
tower, jumped the most since June 20 and  Shuaa Capital PSC  rose
as it appointed a new head for its brokerage unit. Dubai’s  index 
increased 1.5 percent to 1,494.96, the highest this month. The
measure has tumbled 21 percent from this year’s March 28 peak.
The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  gained 1.4 percent and Saudi
Arabia’s benchmark rose 1.6 percent, the most since June 12.  
 “Investors had very low expectations for second-quarter
earnings, so a lot of the downside risk is already priced in,”
said  Sameh Hassan , director of research at Rasmala Investment
Bank Ltd. in Dubai. “If the results are anything slightly
better than a total disaster then stocks should go higher.”  
 Qatar National Bank was the region’s first bank to announce
earnings today after most Gulf markets closed.  Second-quarter
profit  at the country’s biggest lender jumped 36 percent to 1.44
billion riyals ($395 million), beating all six analyst estimates
on Bloomberg. The shares rose 0.2 percent, gaining for a second
day, to 134.4 riyals. They have dropped 4.6 percent since this
year’s high in April.  
 Oil Gains  
 Emaar advanced 3.9 percent to 3.20 dirhams. Shuaa gained 1
percent, rising for the first time since June 20, to 1.02
dirhams. The United Arab Emirates’ largest investment bank
appointed  Walid Shihabi  as chief executive officer of its
brokerage division.  
 Crude oil advanced to as high as $73.30 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The six
nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of
the world’s oil.  
 Red Sea Housing Services Co.  slumped to the lowest since
listing shares in November 2006, falling 3.5 percent to 49
riyals. The Saudi Arabian company that provides ready-made
housing units for the oil industry said it was fined 41 million
riyals ($11 million) by an Algerian court and that it has
appealed the ruling.  
 The  Kuwait Stock Exchange Index  rose 0.7 percent, Oman’s
 MSM30 Index  climbed 1.2 percent and the  QE Index  increased 0.4
percent. Bahrain’s  gauge  advanced 0.2 percent and Abu Dhabi’s
 benchmark index  was little changed.
