             German bund futures may advance as
high as 131.00 should they surpass a key level, UBS AG said,
citing technical indicators.  
 The contract expiring in September faces so-called
resistance at 129.86 and 129.93, the highs from June 29 and June
8 respectively, according to  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-
income technical strategy at UBS in London.  
 “Bunds are set to develop the bullish trade while they
hold above 128.81,” a level “equal to the 38 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the June recovery trade,” Adcock wrote in a
research note today. “As long as this remains the case, the
expectation is for limited corrections and further price
strength.”  
 The September bund contract fell 0.3 percent to 129.30 as
of 9:02 a.m. in London.  
 “We recommend working bids at 128.83,” he said. “The
immediate risk is for a break above the 129.86/129.93 resistance
level, with such developments opening the door to 131.00.”  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance is an area on a chart where orders
to sell a bond and its related instruments may be clustered. The
stronger the resistance, the more buying is needed to advance
through that level. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory
that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a
high or low.
