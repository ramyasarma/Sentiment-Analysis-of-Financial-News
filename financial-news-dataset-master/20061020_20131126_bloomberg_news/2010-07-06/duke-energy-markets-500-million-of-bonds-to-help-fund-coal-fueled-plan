             Duke Energy Indiana Inc ., the
electricity provider building a coal gasification plant in the
state, is marketing $500 million of bonds to help fund the power
facility’s construction and to repay bank debt.  
 The 10-year first-mortgage bonds may be sold as soon as
today and pay about 80 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  
 Duke Energy Indiana is selling bonds for the first time
since March 2009, when it issued $450 million of notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is building
a coal gasification plant in Edwardsport, Indiana. It increased
the project’s estimated cost in April by $530 million to $2.88
billion.  
 A portion of proceeds from the debt sale will be used to
fund the coal plant’s construction, said  Tom Shiel , a spokesman
for  Duke Energy Corp ., the Charlotte, North-Carolina-based
utility that owns Duke Energy Indiana.  
 Other proceeds may be used to repay bank debt, and for
general corporate purposes, Shiel said.  
 The Edwardsport plant is more than 55 percent complete, and
is expected to be operational in 2012,  James Rogers , the parent
company’s chief executive officer, said in a May 4 earnings
call.  
 “The main drivers for the increase are design evolution
and scope growth arising from the uniqueness, complexity and
scale of this plant,” Rogers said. “This is the first time a
plant using this advanced cleaner-coal technology has been built
anywhere in the world at this scale.”
