             U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s
office refused to comment on a report in the Times of London
newspaper that the government was drawing up contingency plans
for a possible breakup or takeover of BP Plc.  
 If there were a contingency plan, “we would never
comment” on it, Cameron’s spokesman Steve Field told reporters
in London today.
