             Investors should buy bullish Apple
Inc.  options  because “rapid growth” in iPhone and iPad sales
may help boost the shares by 58 percent through December 2011,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  
 Equity derivatives strategists  Amyn Bharwani  and  Marko Kolanovic  recommended purchasing October $250 calls while
selling October $280 calls, a strategy known as a call spread
that cuts the cost of the trade while capping potential profit.
Apple gained 0.7 percent to $248.63 in New York.  
 The New York-based strategists cited JPMorgan technology
analyst  Mark Moskowitz , who boosted his Apple share-price
 forecast  by 23 percent to $390 on July 1, calling Cupertino,
California-based Apple “the growth story without rival.”  
 The October options give “enough time” for Moskowitz’s
view to materialize, Bharwani and Kolanovic said. “We think it
would be prudent for investors to gain upside exposure to the
stock through call spreads, rather outright stock, as the stock
is close to its historical highs.”  
 The  trade  will make money at expiration if Apple’s stock is
above $261.60, the strategists said. The shares closed at a
record high of $274.07 on June 18 and have climbed 18 percent
 this year  following the introduction of the iPad. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Information Technology Index is down 11 percent since
Dec. 31.  
 The company said June 22 that it sold 3 million iPads in
the 80 days since the device went on the sale in the U.S. Apple
said June 28 that it sold 1.7 million iPhone 4s in its first
three days, a record for the newest iteration of its top-selling
product featuring video calling and an updated body. The iPhone
4 made its debut in the U.S., U.K., Japan, France and Germany on
June 24.
