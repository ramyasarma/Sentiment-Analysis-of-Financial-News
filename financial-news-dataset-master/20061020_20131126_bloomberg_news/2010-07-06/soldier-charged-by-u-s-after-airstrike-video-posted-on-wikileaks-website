             The U.S. government filed charges,
including the transfer of classified information, against a
soldier accused of giving a video of an airstrike to a website,
according to a press release today.  
 The soldier, Private First Class Bradley Manning, 22, of
the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, in Iraq,
was charged yesterday in a case involving a video obtained by
Wikileaks.org, a website that posts leaked documents, according
to the press release.  
 Manning was also charged with communicating, transmitting
and delivering national defense information to an unauthorized
source. Between November 2009 and May of this year, he obtained
the video, more than 150,000 diplomatic cables and a classified
presentation, according to a list of charges provided by the
Army.  
 “The initial investigation is still ongoing because there
are additional items to sift through,” said Lieutenant Colonel
Eric Bloom, a spokesman for  U.S. Division-Center , the Army
headquarters that oversees security in central Iraq.  
 Bloom said Manning faces up to 52 years in prison if
convicted.  
 In April,  Wikileaks.org  posted a video showing a U.S.
helicopter strike in July 2007 in which 12 people died,
including two journalists. It was taken by cameras on U.S.
Apache helicopters. Wikileaks.org said at the time it had
obtained the footage “from a number of military
whistleblowers.”  
 Attempts to contact a Wikileaks spokesman weren’t
successful.
