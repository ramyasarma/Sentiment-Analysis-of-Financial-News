             U.S. spending on weapons through 2016
likely will grow faster than the overall defense budget, which
will have annual increases of only about 1 percent above
inflation, according to Pentagon Comptroller  Robert Hale .  
 “Our goal would be to get forces and modernization to grow
by 2 or 3 percent,” Hale said in an interview, while saying
that “it’s not a given.”  
 An increase in weapons spending will include greater
purchases of Bethesda, Maryland-based  Lockheed Martin Corp. ’s F-
35 fighter, new ground vehicles, ship construction, satellite
systems and unmanned drones, according to the Pentagon’s long-
range plan.  Northrop Grumman Corp. , of Los Angeles, and Chicago-
based  Boeing Co.  also stand to benefit.  
 Some money may be shifted into equipment and personnel
accounts from an effort to cut $100 billion of overhead costs
over five years,  announced  by Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  on
June 28, Hale said.  
 “Procurement and research are in the ‘gaining’ portion of
the budget,” Hale said. “The goal would be to move money from
support-type activities -- operations and maintenance, military
construction -- into acquisition.”  
 Hale’s remarks are good news for defense contractors, said
Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Washington-based
 Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .  
 “It sounds like they are trying to do everything they can
now to avoid major program cuts in the next few years,”
Harrison said. Yet, if the Pentagon goal of cutting overhead and
support costs isn’t achieved, “they will have no choice but to
cut” programs, he said.  
 ‘Gusher’ Turned Off  
 Gates has announced plans to revamp Pentagon spending,
saying in a May 8 speech that future budgets will see little
real growth because a defense-spending “gusher” that opened
after the Sept. 11 attacks “has been turned off and will stay
off for a good period of time.”  
 In April 2009, Gates proposed to cut and truncate programs
worth as much as $330 billion over their service lives.  
 The Pentagon’s $549 billion base budget request for fiscal
2011 represents an increase of about 1.8 percent over fiscal
2010, when defense spending rose 2.1 percent. Those budgets
follow eight years of 4 percent average annual growth.  
 Hale said there still may be more cuts in store for some
weapons programs after a Pentagon review later this year for the
fiscal 2012 budget.  
 Weapons Spending  
 Congress approved $104.8 billion for weapons buying this
year and is considering proposed procurement spending of $111.2
billion for fiscal 2011, which begins Oct. 1. The Pentagon may
request $120 billion in 2012, rising to $137 billion in 2015,
according to comptroller’s office  projections  that Hale said
are, at this time, only for planning purposes.  
 Estimates about how much money may become available from
the cost-cutting efforts are “going to get squishier” as
projections move further into the future, Hale said. “That’s
just inevitable.”  
 The Pentagon plan calls for $7 billion in savings in 2012,
increasing to $11 billion in 2013 and $18.9 billion in 2014,
according to a  Pentagon fact  sheet. The largest savings are
projected at $37 billion in 2016.  
 While it will be a “significant challenge” to achieve
those goals, Hale said that Gates wants “to push the process a
little bit. Let’s see how far we can get.”
