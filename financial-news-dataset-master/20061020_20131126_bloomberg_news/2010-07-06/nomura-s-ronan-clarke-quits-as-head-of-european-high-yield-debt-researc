             Ronan Clarke , Nomura Holdings Inc.’s
head of high-yield credit research for Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, quit the bank less than nine months after joining,
according to three people familiar with the matter.  
 Clarke left the Tokyo-based firm’s London office last week,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
the matter is private. Clarke was previously with Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in London.  
 Nomura spokeswoman Irina Starkova in London declined to
comment.
