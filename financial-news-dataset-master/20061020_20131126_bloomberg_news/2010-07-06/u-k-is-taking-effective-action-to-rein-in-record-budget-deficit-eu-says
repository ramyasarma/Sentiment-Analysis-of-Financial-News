             The European Union said the U.K. has
taken effective action to rein in its excessive budget deficit.  
 “The current economic circumstances call for a decisive
fiscal consolidation, while not suffocating the nascent economic
recovery,” EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said in a statement issued today in Brussels. “The
budgetary targets presented by the U.K. government are in line
with this strategy.”  
 U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said on
June 22 that the government will reduce spending on welfare
benefits by 11 billion pounds ($16.7 billion) by April 2015 to
help tackle the nation’s record budget deficit. The budget cuts
the fiscal deficit by an extra 40 billion pounds by the end of
this Parliament on top of the 44 billion pounds planned by the
previous Labour government.  
 “Implementing the planned spending cuts - including a 25
percent reduction in departmental budgets in real terms on
average over a four-year period - will be challenging,” the EU
said today. “The new Office of Budget Responsibility and the
new fiscal rule announced by the U.K. authorities should however
contribute to improve the fiscal framework and limit the risks
to the adjustment,” it said.  
 “Provided they are implemented as planned, the measures
announced will strengthen confidence in the U.K.’s commitment to
putting its public finances back on a sustainable path,” the EU
said.
