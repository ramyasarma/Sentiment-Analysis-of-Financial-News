             Alstom SA and partner Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais are well placed to win a
Saudi Arabian contract for a high-speed rail link between Medina
and Mecca, Les Echos reported, without citing anyone.  
 Consortiums from Germany, China and South Korea have pulled
out of the bidding, leaving a Spanish group as the only
competition, according to the newspaper.  
 The contract will be worth at least 10 billion euros, Les
Echos said, citing Alstom Transport head Philippe Mellier.
