             Wheat rose in Chicago and Paris on a
reduced forecast for this year’s Russian grain harvest and on
concern that dry weather in Europe and Central Asia may harm
production.  
 Wheat for September delivery added as much as 2.1 percent
to $5.135 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$5.1325 at 12:45 p.m. Paris time. Milling wheat for November
delivery jumped as much as 3.6 percent in the French capital.  
 Russia will harvest 85 million metric tons of grain this
year, 5 million tons less than previously forecast, because of
heat and drought, the farm ministry said yesterday. Dryness in
wheat-growing regions of France, Germany and the U.K. may hurt
output there, according to Martell Crop Projections.  
 “Concern is mounting regarding the dry and hot situation
developing in western Europe, parts of Russia and former CIS
regions,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in an e-mailed
report today, referring to the former Commonwealth of
Independent States. “Crop damage is likely.”  
 Chicago-traded wheat rose for a fourth day to the highest
level for the most-active contract since May 10.  
 In Paris, milling wheat gained for a sixth day on NYSE
Liffe, the longest winning streak for the November contract
since it started trading in March 2009. The grain climbed as
high as 159.75 euros ($201.08) a ton, the highest level since
June last year, and was last at 159 euros.  
 Second-Biggest Exporter  
 Russia vies with Canada to rank as the world’s second-
largest wheat exporter after the U.S. The estimate for the 2010-
11 harvest was cut because “the drought is more severe than
expected,” Russian Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said,
according to a  transcript  posted on the state website July 5.  
 Russia will have warmer weather with mean temperatures
ranging from 21 to 22 degrees Celsius (69.8 to 71.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) from tomorrow to July 13, according to weather
forecasts on the Bloomberg. That’s higher than the 30-year
average of 18.3 degrees, according to Bloomberg data.  
 The European Union, the world’s  largest  wheat-producing
region, was  forecast  by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
export 22 million tons in the 2010-11 season, up from 21 million
tons a year earlier.  
 Rainfall in parts of the French, German and U.K. grain-
growing regions was between 60 percent and 80 percent of normal
in the 180 days through June 29, and output may be lower than
forecast by the USDA, Martell said in a July 2 report.  
 Kazakh Temperatures  
 “We still need several days to better measure the impact
of these weather conditions on yields,” Paris-based farm
adviser Agritel said in a comment on its website today.  
 Kazakhstan, forecast to be the world’s fifth-largest wheat
exporter in the 2010-11 season, will have mean temperatures from
22.4 to 26.3 degrees Celsius between tomorrow and July 13,
according to forecasts on the Bloomberg. That compares with a
30-year average of 23 degrees.  
 “High temperatures are also still rampant in Russia in
particular and in Kazakhstan, two countries that play a major
role in international markets,” Agritel said.  
 Corn for December delivery rose 1.1 percent to $3.8875 a
bushel in Chicago and November-delivery soybeans added 0.4
percent to $9.0925 a bushel. In Paris, corn for November
delivery jumped 3.3 percent to 165.25 euros a ton and malting
barley for March delivery rose 3.2 percent to 191 euros a ton.
