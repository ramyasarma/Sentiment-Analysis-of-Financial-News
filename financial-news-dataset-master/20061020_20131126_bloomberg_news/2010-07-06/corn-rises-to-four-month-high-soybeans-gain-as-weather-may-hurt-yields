             Corn rose to a four-month high and
soybeans gained the most in a week on speculation that adverse
weather will reduce yields in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower and exporter.  
 Four inches of rain (10 centimeters) fell in parts of the
Midwest over the past three days, causing floods that damaged
some crops, according to World Weather Inc. From southern
Missouri to North Carolina, rain is needed to ease stress on
plants that have had less than 25 percent of normal
precipitation the past two weeks, according to the forecaster.  
 “The weather has not been conducive for optimal yield
potential,” said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin. “People
are starting to realize that the rains are reducing yields, and
dry weather across the southern U.S. may also cut yields.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 1.25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.8575 a bushel at 10:25 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, after touching $3.915, the highest level since March
1. The most-active futures rose 6.7 percent last week, the third
gain in four weeks, after the government said U.S. farmers
planted less then they intended this year.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 4 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $9.0975 a bushel. A close at that price would be the
largest gain for the most-active futures since June 28.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
