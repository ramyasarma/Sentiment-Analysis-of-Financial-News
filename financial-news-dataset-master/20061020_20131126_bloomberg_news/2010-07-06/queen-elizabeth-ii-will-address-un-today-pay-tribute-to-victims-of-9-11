             Queen Elizabeth II  of the U.K.,
making her first  visit  to New York since the 1976 bicentennial
of U.S. independence from Great Britain, will address the United
Nations and visit the World Trade Center site today.  
 The queen’s speech to the UN will be her first since 1957,
which was 12 years after the world body was established.  
 “Time has in fact made the task of the United Nations more
difficult than it seemed when the terms of the charter were
agreed at San Francisco 12 years ago,” she  said  at the time.
“We are still far from the achievement of the ideals which I
have mentioned but we must not be discouraged. The peoples of
the world expect the United Nations to persevere in its
efforts.”  
 After today’s speech, the queen and her husband,  Prince Philip , will visit the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attack on New York, and then view a memorial at Hanover Square,
in lower Manhattan, to the 67 British victims of the attack.  
 The 84-year-old monarch is visiting during a heat wave in
New York, with the National Weather Service warning people to
stay in the shade. Temperatures are forecast to break 100
degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) for the first time in
more than eight years.
