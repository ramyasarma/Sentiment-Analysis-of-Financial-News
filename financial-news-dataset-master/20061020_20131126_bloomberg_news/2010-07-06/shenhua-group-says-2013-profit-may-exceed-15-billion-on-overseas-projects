             Shenhua Group Corp. , China’s biggest
coal producer, expects profit to exceed 100 billion yuan ($15
billion) by 2013 as the company develops projects in Australia,
Indonesia, Mongolia and Russia.  
 The company has a revenue target of 300 billion yuan for
2013, according to notes in a speech to be delivered tomorrow by
Li Jingping, general manager of coal transport and sales, at a
coal conference in Dalian city.  
 Profit may reach 45 billion yuan in 2009,  Zhang Xiwu ,
chairman of the parent of Hong-Kong listed China Shenhua Energy
Co., said last year. Peabody Energy Corp., the biggest U.S.
producer, reported a net income of  $448 million  in 2009. Shenhua
is developing overseas projects to meet demand for coal, used to
generate 80 percent of China’s power, after the nation became a
net importer of the fuel for the first time in 2009.  
 The nation’s thermal coal consumption may rise to 2.3
billion metric tons by 2015, Li said in the notes obtained by
Bloomberg News today. That compares with 1.5 billion tons
consumed by China in 2009 and U.S. demand of 498 million tons,
according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Total
coal demand in China, including metallurgical coal, may rise to
3.7 billion tons, Li said.  
 China’s domestic coal output may increase to 4 billion tons
by 2015, according to the notes. The country’s coal-fired power
generators capacity may reach 960 million kilowatts, he wrote.  
 Shenhua’s  installed power capacity may reach 62.2 million
kilowatts in 2015, of which 48.6 million kilowatts will be coal-
fired generators, and 5.4 million kilowatts wind and solar
plants, the notes said.  
 Shenhua’s Power Output  
 The company’s power output for this year is estimated at
150 billion kilowatts and coal production may reach 360 million
tons. Commercial coal sales may rise to 420 million tons by the
end of this year, Li said.  
 China’s share of electricity generated from coal-fired
plants may fall to 72 percent by 2015 from 75.9 percent now,
according to Li. The world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter
wants to cut coal consumption and boost use of cleaner-burning
alternatives as the government sets a target to reduce carbon
dioxide the nation emits for each unit of economic output by 40
to 45 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels.  
 The company may produce 2.5 million tons of fuel from coal-
to-liquid projects, Li wrote separately.  
 Shenhua started operating the nation’s first plant to turn
coal into fuels such as gasoline and diesel in 2008. The plant
is located in Inner Mongolia.
