             Brazil rail freight rates may fall as
much as 40 percent as a result of new rules the government plans
to introduce through a presidential decree by the end of July,
said the country’s land transportation agency, ANTT.  
 “We’re opening alternative rail corridors in the most
critical areas and creating a more competitive environment,”
 Bernardo Figueiredo , head of ANTT, said in an interview in
Brasilia yesterday.  
 President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  is expected to sign a
decree by the end of the month to change rules governing the
rail industry, Figueiredo said. The new plan may lead to 5,000
kilometers (3,107 miles) of new railway lines by 2011, he said.  
 Vale SA ,  MRS Logistica SA  and  ALL America Latina Logistica
SA  are among the main railroad operators in Brazil. The
government plan will require those companies to allow the use of
their railways by other groups, under a toll charge, Figueiredo
said.  
 The plan will also require idled railways to be put back
into operation. According to ANTT, only 10,000 kilometers of
Brazil’s 28,000 kilometers of railways are currently in use.
