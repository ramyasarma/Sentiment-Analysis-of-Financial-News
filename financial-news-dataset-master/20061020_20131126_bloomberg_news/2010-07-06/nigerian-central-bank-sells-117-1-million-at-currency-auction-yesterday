             Nigerian banks bought the smallest
amount of dollars in more than three months at an auction by the
West African nation’s central bank yesterday as demand from
companies declined.  
 The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $117.1 million at the
auction, the least since March 24, data from its  website  show.
The bank had $200 million on offer, the smallest available
amount since the auction on March 29.  
 “This is a period of low dollar demand from companies,
though we may see them making more demands later in the year
when they plan for the coming year,” Kweku Brown an analyst
with Lagos-based Source Capital Nigeria Ltd., said by phone.
“We have seen an appreciation of the naira in past weeks as
the central bank has been seriously defending its level by
trying to match foreign exchange demands of lenders at the
market.”  
 The naira depreciated to 152.35 per dollar on May 18, the
weakest level this year, with demand for dollars exceeding
supply at all currency auctions from April 26 till then. The
central bank increased dollars on offer to ease pressure on the
naira, with the currency appreciating 1.2 percent since May 18.  
 Nigeria is “comfortable” with current naira levels and
believes the currency is unlikely to come under pressure, with
foreign reserves capable of funding 17 months of imports,
central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said on July 1.  
 Sanusi’s statement “brought a lot of stability in the
market and restored some confidence that the naira will be
stable for some time,” Brown said.
