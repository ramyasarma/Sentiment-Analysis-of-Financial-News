             U.S. retailers will suffer from a
“consumer hangover” that lasts through the holiday shopping
season, according to  Deborah L. Weinswig , an analyst at
Citigroup Inc.  
 As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, retail-sales growth is
beginning to slow and share prices are signaling that further
weakness lies ahead. The chart compares year-to-year percentage
changes in sales, as compiled by the Commerce Department, with
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Retailing  Index  on a monthly basis.  
 Weinswig cut earnings estimates for  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ,
the world’s largest retailer, as well as  Home Depot Inc. ,  J.C.
Penney Co. ,  Kohl’s Corp. ,  Lowe’s Cos. ,  Macy’s Inc. ,  Nordstrom
Inc. ,  Saks Inc.  and  Target Corp.  through January 2013. She
lowered stock-price projections for each company as well.  
 Cutbacks in government aid to the  unemployed , reduced
 consumer credit  and looming tax increases will make consumers
less inclined to spend after a “shopping binge” earlier in the
year, Weinswig wrote yesterday in a report. She also cited:  
 -- “A lack of fashion newness” that would draw shoppers
into stores. “Key trends such as lace, vests, tunic tops and
skinny legs are consistent with last year,” the report said.  
 -- The risk that retailers may depend more heavily on
markdowns in the next few months.  Inventories  appear to be
relatively high, Weinswig wrote, and the earlier pickup in
demand may have prompted chains to order too much fall and
holiday merchandise.
