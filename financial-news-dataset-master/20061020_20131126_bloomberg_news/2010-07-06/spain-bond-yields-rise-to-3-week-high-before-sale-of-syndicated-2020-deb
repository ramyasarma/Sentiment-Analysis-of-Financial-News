             Spanish bond yields rose to the
highest in almost three weeks as the nation raised 6 billion
euros ($7.6 billion) to plug the euro region’s third-largest
budget deficit.  
 The Mediterranean nation sold new notes due in October 2020
that were priced to yield 195 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, or about 4.85 percent, according to a
person with knowledge of the deal. The yield on Spain’s existing
10-year benchmark debt climbed 5 basis points to 4.66 percent
after earlier touching 4.68 percent, the  highest  since June 18.  
 Spain is offering its first syndicated bond issue since
February as it seeks to reduce a budget gap that’s almost four
times the euro region’s 3 percent target. The nation is in
danger of losing its Aaa credit rating after Moody’s Investors
Service said June 30 it may downgrade its debt, citing
“deteriorating” prospects for economic growth.  
 “Given the pressures on southern European sovereign bonds,
the reception and performance of this deal will be important for
market sentiment,”  Charles Stephens , a debt capital markets
specialist at Matrix Corporate Capital LLP in London, wrote in a
note to investors.  
 Spain received 13 billion euros of orders for the new
bonds, a banker involved in the deal said. Barclays Capital,
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Caja Madrid, Credit
Agricole, Deutsche Bank AG and Banco Santander SA are managing
the sale.  
 Swap Drop  
 The cost of insuring Spanish government debt fell, with
credit-default swaps on the nation declining 10.5 basis points
to 254.5, compared with a record-high closing price of 274.5 on
May 6, according to CMA DataVision. That means it costs $254,500
annually to protect $10 million of debt for five years.  
 The difference, or spread, between 10-year Spanish notes
and equivalent German bunds is 205 basis points, close to the
14-year peak of 221 basis points on June 16.  
 Spain issued 5 billion euros of five-year bonds in February
to yield 85 basis points more than swaps.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
country or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
