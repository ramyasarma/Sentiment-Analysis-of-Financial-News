             Toyota Kirloskar Motor Ltd.,  the
Indian unit of the world’s biggest carmaker, will invest 5
billion rupees ($107 million) on a facility to build engines and
transmissions for its Etios model, Managing Director Hiroshi
Nakagawa said  
 Domestic production of engines will enable the company “to
provide the best quality product at a competitive price,”
Nakagawa told reporters in Bangalore today. The company will
start making the Etios compact in December, he said.  
 Global carmakers such as  Toyota Motor Corp.,  Honda Motor
Co., General Motors Co. are introducing new models and building
factories to boost sales in India, where Suzuki Motor Corp.
controls half the market. Automakers are betting on China and
India that have bucked a slump in worldwide vehicle demand.  
 The Etios will be made at a new plant with a capacity to
make 70,000 cars initially, Nakagawa said. The company will
increase production capacity to 200,000 cars “based on
demand,” he said.  
 Toyota Kirloskar Auto Parts Pvt., based in the southern
Indian state of Karnataka, will make 100,000 engines starting
from the third quarter of 2012 and 240,000 transmissions
starting early 2013, Nakagawa said.  
 “Initially, we will import engines from Japan,” he said.  
 Toyota Motor aims to sell 70,000 cars this year and expects
to sell double that number next year, Nakagawa said.
