                  July 6 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- Israeli property
developer  Gelats Investments Co Ltd.  plans to begin construction
shortly on two photovoltaic power projects in northern Israel,
the company’s first outside of Europe.  
 Two rooftop systems are planned, with a capacity of 1.12
megawatts and 1.3 megawatts, respectively, at locations in
north-central Israel, Adi Gazit, investments director at Gelats,
said in a telephone interview.  
 Gelats recently reported to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
that it had entered into a partnership with a local engineering,
procurement and construction contractor to build the plants.  
 Construction should begin “in the next few weeks,” Gazit
said, declining to reveal the partner or the cost of the
installations.  
 The projects will be the firm’s first in Israel and will
add to several plants  Gelats  owns in southern Europe. The
company has a total of 15 megawatts of installed photovoltaic
capacity in Spain, which it developed in partnership with
Israel-based infrastructure group Shikun & Binui Ltd.  
 Gelats also owns a 2-megawatt plant in Puglia, southern
Italy, which it developed with an unidentified Italian
contractor.  
 In April Gelats announced to the stock exchange that it had
signed a memorandum of understanding to purchase seven solar
parks in Italy for $34.8 million. Gazit said Gelats is
conducting due diligence for the projects and has not closed any
deals as yet.
