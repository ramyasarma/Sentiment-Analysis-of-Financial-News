             BG Group Plc  plans to add a third
pipeline to the West Delta Deep Marine gas project offshore
Egypt that will be operational by the end of this year, BG
Egypt’s president said today.  
 The Reading, England-based company also plans to drill nine
more development wells in the  concession  in late 2011 in a $1
billion investment, Arshad Sufi told reporters in Cairo.  
 BG said in October 2009 that it plans to invest $4 billion
over five years in the North African country. BG Egypt, which is
currently exploring for gas in three blocks off the eastern
shores of the Nile Delta, will be evaluating opportunities to
bid for more blocks in the future, Sufi said.  
 “Egypt is a core area for us,” he said. “We hope to
participate in future exploration.”  
 BG produces 2 billion cubic feet (56 million cubic meters)
of gas a day, as much as 40 percent of the country’s total
output. Egypt has 77.2 trillion cubic feet of proven  natural gas
reserves , according to the Oil Ministry.
