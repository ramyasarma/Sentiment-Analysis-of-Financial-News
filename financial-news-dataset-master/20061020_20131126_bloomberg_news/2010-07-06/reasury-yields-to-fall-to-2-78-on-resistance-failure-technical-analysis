             Treasury 10-year yields may fall to
the lowest level in more than 14 months after struggling to
break through a key resistance level, BNP Paribas Securities
Japan Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  
 The yields’ upward momentum has been capped by their five-
day moving average, said  Tomohisa Fujiki , a Tokyo-based
interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas. Ten-year rates also
have remained below the 50-day moving average since April 30,
indicating they are in a downtrend, Fujiki said.  
 “Judging from the chart, I don’t see where the declines in
yields can stop in the near term,” Fujiki said in an interview
with Bloomberg News yesterday.  
 The benchmark 10-year note yielded 2.93 percent yesterday
in New York.  
 Should rates drop below the 2.88 percent level reached on
July 1, they may slide to 2.78 percent, the lowest since April
21, 2009, Fujiki said.
