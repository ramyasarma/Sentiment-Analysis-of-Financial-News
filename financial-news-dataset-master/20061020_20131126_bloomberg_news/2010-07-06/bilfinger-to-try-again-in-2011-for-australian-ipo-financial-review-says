             Bilfinger Berger AG, Germany’s
second-largest construction company, is likely to try and float
its Australian unit Valemus Ltd. in 2011, the Australian
Financial Review reported, without saying where it got the
information. Bilfinger pulled the initial public offering after
investors balked at the price the company was seeking.
