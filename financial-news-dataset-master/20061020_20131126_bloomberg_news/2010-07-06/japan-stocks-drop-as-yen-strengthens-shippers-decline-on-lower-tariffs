             Japanese  stocks  gained the most in
two weeks after a rally in China shares boosted investor
optimism and as the yen retreated from earlier gains.  
 Fanuc Ltd. , an industrial robot maker that receives almost
half of its revenue from Asia, rose 1.4 percent. Komatsu Ltd.,
an earthmover maker that gets about 22 percent of sales from
China, gained 2.2 percent. Daihatsu Motor Co., which counts Asia
outside Japan as its largest overseas market, jumped 6.4 percent.  
 “The rally in China’s stocks gave direction to investors,
and they started buying stocks again,” said  Ayako Sera , a
strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which
manages about $310 billion. “Markets in the U.S. were closed
yesterday, so there wasn’t much direction this morning.”  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  advanced 0.8 percent to
9,338.04 at the close of trading in Tokyo. The gauge fell as
much as 1.9 percent today, led by exporters as the yen
strengthened against the euro during early trading. The Topix
index rose 1.2 percent to 847.24, with more than three stocks
climbing for each that fell.  
 The Topix has tumbled 6.7 percent this year as concerns
about Europe’s deficit and China’s efforts to curb property
prices dented confidence in global economic growth. Companies in
the gauge trade at 16.5 times estimated earnings, compared with
about 35.6 times at the beginning of the year. Their price-to-
book ratio is 1, the cheapest of the world’s 10-largest equities
markets.
