             New Jersey Transit’s rail service on
all lines is delayed 20 minutes to 30 minutes because of
weather-related issues, according to an e-mailed statement.  
 The temperature in Newark, New Jersey, hit 103, a
record for the day, Richard Castro, a National Weather Service
meteorologist, said in an interview from Upton, New York. New
