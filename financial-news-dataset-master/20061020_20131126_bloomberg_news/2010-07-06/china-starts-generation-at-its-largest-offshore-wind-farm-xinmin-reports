             China officially started transmitting
power today from its biggest offshore wind farm to the mainland
grid, Xinmin Evening News reported.  
 The 102-megawatt Donghai Bridge Wind Farm off Shanghai’s
coast may generate 267 million kilowatt-hours of power a year,
the newspaper  reported  on its website. That could meet the needs
of more than 200,000 households in the city, Xinmin said.  
 The Donghai Bridge project has won initial approval for
additional wind turbines totaling 100 megawatts in capacity,
according to Xinmin. Shanghai also plans to build another four
offshore wind farms, the newspaper said.
