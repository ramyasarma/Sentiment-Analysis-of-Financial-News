             Gold may weaken for a second day on
speculation that investment demand is slowing after the metal
failed to extend its rally to a record.  
 Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent
to $1,203.15 an ounce before trading at 1,207.75 an ounce at
1:35 p.m. in Singapore. August-delivery futures were little
changed at $1,208.10 an ounce in New York.  
 “People are testing the bottom of the gold to find
support,” said  Ellison Chu , a Hong Kong-based metals manager
with Standard Bank Asia Ltd. “Trading is still quiet.”  
 Assets in the  SPDR Gold Trust,  the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, dropped for a second day, declining 0.3
metric tons to 1,318.91 tons on July 2, according to the
company’s website. The dollar strengthened 0.3 percent against a
basket of six major currencies before declining 0.1 percent.  
 “Gold needs a fresh catalyst,”  Mark Pervan , head of
commodity research with Aautralia and New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd., wrote in a report today. “The longs were clearly
disappointed prices couldn’t breach fresh record highs and may
decide that prices have peaked for now.” Long positions are
bets that prices will rise.  
 Gold touched $1,196.65 an ounce last week, the lowest level
since May 25, after climbing to a record $1,265.30 on June 21.
The metal has risen 10 percent in 2010, keeping it on course for
a 10th annual gain, as investors seek to preserve their wealth
from declining currencies, including the euro.  
 “With gold touching its lowest close in over a month, we
see these levels as a good entry point for fresh long
positions,”  Hussein Allidina , head of commodity research at
Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report today.  
 Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at $17.815
an ounce, while platinum lost 0.2 percent to $1,501.85 an ounce.
Palladium gained 0.6 percent at $431.45 an ounce.
