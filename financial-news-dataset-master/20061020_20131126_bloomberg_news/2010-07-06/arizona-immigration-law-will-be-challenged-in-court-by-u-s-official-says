             The Justice Department plans to
challenge the new Arizona immigration law on the grounds that it
encroaches on the federal government’s responsibilities,
according to a U.S. official.  
 The department expects to file a lawsuit today, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter
isn’t yet public. The lawsuit will say that federal law sets
U.S. immigration policy and doesn’t permit states to create
conflicting statutes, the official said.  
 A legal challenge steps up the battle between the Obama
administration and Arizona. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
last month said the administration planned to challenge the law.  
 The Arizona law requires that local law enforcement
officials check the immigration status of anyone they suspect is
in the country illegally. The law, which takes effect in late
July, makes it a crime to be in Arizona without proper
documents.  
 Overhauling immigration laws is one of President  Barack Obama ’s highest priorities. In 2007, Congress failed in an
attempt to rewrite immigration legislation for the first time in
20 years. Obama said in April that lawmakers may lack the
“appetite” to try again this year. Democratic leaders are
focusing on measures to improve border security before
addressing the 11 million undocumented immigrants now in the
U.S.
