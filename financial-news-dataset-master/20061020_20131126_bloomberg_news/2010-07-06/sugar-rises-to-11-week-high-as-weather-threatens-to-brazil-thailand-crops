             Raw-sugar prices fell on speculation
that a rally to an 11-week high may have gone too far as
concerns eased that weather may damage crops.  
 India’s monsoon, which accounts for more than 70 percent of
the country’s annual rainfall, covered the entire nation nine
days ahead of usual today, boosting prospects for a bigger cane
harvest. The monsoon was 16 percent below normal in June. India
is the world’s biggest sugar user.  
 “The weather concerns have abated a little bit,” said
 Anthony Compagnino , a partner at East Coast Options Services in
New York. “The fact that it fell technically at the 100-day
moving average has given the bears some confidence to put some
pressure on the market.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery slipped 0.01 cent, or 0.1
percent, to 16.69 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, prices advanced to 16.98 cents, the highest level for a
most-active contract since April 20. The price has slipped 38
percent this year on expectations that rising output would end
two years of insufficient production.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, refined-sugar futures for
October delivery fell 10 cents to $502.30 a metric ton.  
 Without any weather issues or problems, Brazil likely will
produce enough sugar to meet customers’ demands, Compagnino
said.  
 Sugar output in the country’s Center South, the world’s
biggest producing region, rose 31 percent in the first half of
June, industry association Unica said in an e-mailed statement
on July 5.
