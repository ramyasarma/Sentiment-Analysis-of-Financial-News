             French Budget Minister  Francois Baroin  vowed to meet the government’s deficit-reduction goals,
saying next year’s target is “untouchable and not negotiable.”  
 President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has pledged to reduce France’s
 budget shortfall  to 6 percent of gross domestic product next
year and then to 3 percent in 2013 from 8 percent this year.  
 “We’ll use all necessary means to get there,” Baroin said
today on  RTL radio . “We’ll go sector by sector. Yes, the 2011
budget is going to be a difficult one.”  
 The remarks reflect a fresh push on the part of Sarkozy’s
government to prepare voters for spending cuts and tax
increases. They’re also an effort to reassure investors that
France, the only country among Europe’s five biggest economies
that has yet to set out a  deficit -reduction plan for next year,
is committed to reaching its goals.  
 Baroin, who will lead a finance debate in France’s National
Assembly later today, said that the 2011 target is
“realistic.” Of 40 billion euros ($50 billion) in required
savings, 15 billion euros will come from stimulus measures that
will not be renewed, 11 billion euros will come from a recovery
in tax receipts and 14 billion euros will come from tightening
departmental spending plans, the minister said.  
 “We have a methodology and a timetable,” Baroin said.
“We have to be responsible.”  
 Concern among investors about France’s seriousness in
getting to grips with its deficit came to the fore last month as
the  premium the nation pays to borrow  shot up. The yield spread
between French and German 10-year government bonds jumped to
55.6 basis points on June 8 from 26.1 points at the end of May.
It has since dropped back to 37.8 points, still above the spread
of 20.6 points at the end of last year.  
 Sarkozy and Baroin are pressing the budget cuts together
with an attempt to raise France’s minimum retirement age to 62
from 60. The efforts come at a time when Sarkozy’s popularity is
at the lowest level since he took office in 2007.  
 The president’s popularity fell 2 percentage points to 26
percent in a TNS Sofres poll published July 1. TNS Sofres
interviewed 1,000 voters between June 25 and June 28.
