                  July 6 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- Ningxia Guodian
CSI New Energy, a joint venture between a unit of China Guodian
Corp. and photovoltaic module maker Canadian Solar Inc., has
commissioned a 10-megawatt solar plant in central China.  
 Construction started in March and the plant was connected
to the grid July 2, the engineering, procurement and
construction contractor GCL Solar said in a statement. The
project, in Pingluo, Ningxia Autonomous Region, is the first
phase of a 50-megawatt solar project, which is estimated to cost
1.25 billion yuan ($184 million).  
 The project was cleared by the National Development and
Reform Commission in May to apply for the United Nations Clean
Development Mechanism. The project is expected to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by 14,855 metric tons a year.
