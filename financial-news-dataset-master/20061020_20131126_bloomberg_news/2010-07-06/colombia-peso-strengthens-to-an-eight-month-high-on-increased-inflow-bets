             Colombia’s peso fell from an eight-
month high following a decline in oil, the nation’s biggest
export.  
 The peso fell 0.3 percent to 1,893.10 per U.S. dollar at
3:29 p.m. New York time, from 1,887.5 yesterday. The currency
earlier strengthened to 1,875.3, the highest since Oct. 20,
2009. The peso has jumped 8 percent this year, the best
performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Colombian
markets were closed yesterday for a national holiday.  
 “The market turned around when oil started dropping,”
said  Julian Ramirez , an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Proyectar Valores SA. Oil fell as much as 1.5 percent.  
 Colombia’s peso bonds also erased earlier gains on concern
lower demand for higher-yielding emerging-market assets will
make the nation’s plans to seek overseas funding more expensive,
according to Ramirez.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.77
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price dropped 0.2 centavo to 121.929 centavos per peso.  
 “Risk aversion is on the rise again,” said Ramirez.  
 Colombia will sell an additional $1 billion abroad, of
which $500 million will be in overseas bonds and $500 million
from multilateral lenders, to replace revenue from the scrapped
sale of power company Isagen SA, Finance Minister  Oscar Ivan Zuluaga  said July 2.  
 President-elect  Juan Manuel Santos , who is slated to take
office Aug. 7, won’t sell Isagen, Zuluaga said. The 2010 budget
included 4 trillion pesos ($2.13 billion) in revenue from the
sale of the power company and five regional electric companies,
which may be delayed, he said.  
 The government will also auction 2 trillion pesos more of
local debt, known as TES, this year to cover the gap, Zuluaga
said.
