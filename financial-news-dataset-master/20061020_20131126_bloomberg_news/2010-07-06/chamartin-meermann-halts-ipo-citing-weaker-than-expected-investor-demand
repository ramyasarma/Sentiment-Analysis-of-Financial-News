             Chamartin Meermann Immobilien AG ,
Berlin’s largest property developer, canceled its initial public
offering because potential buyers didn’t show enough interest.  
 “Reasons for investor restraint were the imponderables
connected with the business of real estate developers,” CMI
said in a statement after the market closed yesterday. The
company said it will consider listing the shares later.  
 CMI planned to sell as many as 7.3 million shares for 7.70
euros ($9.7) to 9.70 euros each. The company wanted to use the
proceeds to help finance its growth in Germany’s capital city.  
 The announcement was made on the same day that  Bilfinger
Berger AG , Germany’s second-largest construction company,
delayed the initial share sale of its Australian unit, citing a
drop in stock markets.  GSW Immobilien AG , the real estate
company owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Cerberus Capital
Management LP, postponed its share offering on May 5.  
 CMI builds homes, office properties and hotels in and
around Berlin’s government district. It has 27 projects in the
German capital, including the 464-room Sheraton Berlin Hotel and
the  Palais am Deutschen Theater , which will offer about 21,500
square meters (231,000 square feet) of space to lease when it’s
completed. CMI said the canceled IPO won’t affect operations.
