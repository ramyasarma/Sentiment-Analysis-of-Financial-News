             Japanese  stock  futures fell after U.S.
service industries expanded more slowly than expected, while
Australian futures rose after metal prices gained.  
 American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., a Japanese
camera maker that receives about 27 percent of its revenue from
the Americas, dropped 0.4 percent from the Tokyo close yesterday.
Those of  Sharp Corp. , which receives more than half of its sales
overseas, slid 1 percent. ADRs  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
largest mining company, rose 0.9 percent from the closing price
in Sydney after metal prices gained.  
 “The U.S. economy is slowing down,” said  Hiroichi Nishi ,
an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.
“Things have started to become cheap, but it’s not enough of a
reason to buy.”  
 Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September closed at 9,320 in Chicago yesterday,
compared with 9,380 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-
market at 9,320 as of 8:05 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225 closed
at 9,338.04 yesterday.  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  rose 0.3 percent.
New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  gained 0.5 percent today in
Wellington.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  tumbled 12 percent from this
year’s high on April 15, as China’s tightening measures and
deficits in Europe fueled concerns global economic growth will
slow. Companies in the gauge trade at 13.6 times estimated
earnings, the lowest since December 2008.

 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed at 1,024.10. The gauge pared gains of as much as 2
percent to close 0.5 percent higher in New York yesterday after
the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing
businesses in June fell more than expected to a four-month low
from May.  
 The  London Metals Exchange Index , a measure of six metals,
rose 2.2 percent yesterday, while copper futures for September
delivery climbed 1.9 percent as shrinking inventories signaled
demand will remain steady even as global economic growth slows.  
 Samsung Electronics Co. , Asia’s biggest maker of chips,
flat screens and mobile phones, may be active today. The
company’s second-quarter operating income may be about 4.8
trillion won ($3.93 billion), the Maeil Business Newspaper
reported, citing the company. This would be the company’s
largest quarterly operating income ever, according to the
Korean-language report.  
 Showa Denko K.K. , a Japanese chemical products maker, may
also be active. The company may have operating profit exceeding
a previous forecast by about 1 billion yen ($11.4 million),
Nikkei English News reported.
