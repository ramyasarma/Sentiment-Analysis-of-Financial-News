             E.ON AG plans to spend 500 million
kronor ($65.1 million) on wind power in Sweden, Dagens Industri
reported, citing Jonas Abrahamsson, head of E.ON’s Nordic unit.  
 The wind turbines, which will be located near Gothenburg,
Helsingborg and Nybro, are part of a 58 billion-krona investment
program that runs over seven years and will see the German
utility invest in its Swedish nuclear power reactors and in
renewable energy, the daily today cited Abrahamsson as saying.
