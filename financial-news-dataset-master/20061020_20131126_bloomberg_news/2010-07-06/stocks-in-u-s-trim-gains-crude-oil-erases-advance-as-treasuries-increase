             U.S. stocks erased most of an early
rally, oil wiped out its advance and Treasuries gained amid
growing concern economic growth is slowing.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,023.63 at 1:55 p.m. in New York after jumping 2 percent in
early trading. Crude oil dropped 0.6 percent to $71.68 a barrel
after advancing to almost $74 earlier. The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note slipped four basis points to 2.94 percent.  
 “Most people finger the middle of last year as the bottom
of the economy and we should be seeing more robust numbers than
just barely squeaking by,” said Kevin Caron, a market
strategist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Florham Park, New Jersey,
which oversees about $90 billion in client assets. “Lighter-
than-expected ISM non-manufacturing today, lighter-than-
expected-vehicle sales last week, lighter-than-expected increase
in payrolls, higher initial jobless claims: put that altogether
and you get something of a less robust economic climate.”
