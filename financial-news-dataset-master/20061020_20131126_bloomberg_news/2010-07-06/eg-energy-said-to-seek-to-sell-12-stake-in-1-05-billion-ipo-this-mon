             MEG Energy Corp., a Canadian oil-
sands developer, will seek to sell a 12 percent stake in an
initial public offering worth as much as C$1.1 billion ($1.05
billion) this month to expand its Christina Lake project, people
familiar with the sale said.  
 MEG plans to sell 23 million shares for between C$42 and
C$48 a share in its IPO, according to five people familiar with
the sale. That would value the Calgary-based company at as much
as C$9.2 billion, based on 192 million basic shares outstanding
after the offering.  
 The sale will be the second-largest IPO in Canada this
year, after the C$1.35 billion sale by  Athabasca Oil Sands Corp. 
in April. Smart Technologies Inc., a Calgary-based whiteboard
maker backed by Intel Corp., may raise $635 million in an IPO
scheduled for July 14 in Canada and the U.S.  
 MEG, partly owned by China’s  CNOOC Ltd.  and New York-based
investment firm Warburg Pincus LLC, filed an update of its June
14 filing yesterday. MEG, which initially planned to raise
between C$1 billion to C$1.25 billion, is aiming to sell the
shares on July 28.  
 The company is focused on oil-sands development and
production in Alberta’s southern Athabasca region. The company,
which has 840 square miles (2,175 square kilometers) of oil-sand
leases, is raising money to fund its project at Christina Lake,
which has produced bitumen since 2008.  
 IPO Bankers  
 Credit Suisse Securities Canada is leading a group of nine
banks including BMO Nesbitt Burns, Barclays Capital Canada and
Morgan Stanley Canada for the MEG sale. Banks may sell another
3.45 million shares after the sale to meet demand, bringing
proceeds to C$1.27 billion.  
 Warburg Pincus owns about 26 percent of MEG, while CNOOC
owns a 17 percent stake, according to filings. MEG has raised
more than C$2.3 billion from private investors since 2007, the
company said.  
 MEG Energy has 1.7 billion barrels of proved and probable
bitumen reserves as of Dec. 31, according to independent
reservoir engineering firm GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd.  
 The company plans to expand bitumen production capacity at
its Christina Lake and Surmont projects to 260,000 barrels per
day by 2020 and produce at that rate for over 30 years,
according to the prospectus.  
 MEG was founded by President and Chief Executive Officer
William McCaffrey in March, 1999. Prior to founding MEG,
McCaffrey spent 17 years on business and oil sands development
at Amoco Canada before the company was acquired by BP Plc.
