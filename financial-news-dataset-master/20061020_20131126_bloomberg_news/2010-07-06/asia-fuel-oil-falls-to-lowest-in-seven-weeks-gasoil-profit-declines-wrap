             Asia fuel oil swaps fell to the
lowest in seven weeks, leading declines in gasoil and naphtha,
as refining profit decreased and crude extended losses.  
 High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for August dropped $6.75, or 1.6
percent, to $421 a metric ton at 12 p.m. in Singapore, the
region’s biggest oil-trading center, according to data from
broker PVM Oil Associates. That’s the lowest since May 26. The
product’s  discount  to Dubai crude, the Asian benchmark, widened
for the first time in six days to $4.88 a barrel, signaling
deepening refining losses.  
 Crude dropped for a sixth day in New York amid concern the
global economic recovery would slow and stall a rebound in fuel
demand. Futures, which reached a 19-month high of $87.15 a
barrel in May, have tumbled almost 10 percent this year.  
 “Without an improving economy, it is difficult to make any
lasting case for oil prices being this high,”  Peter Beutel ,
president of energy adviser Cameron Hanover Inc. in New Canaan,
Connecticut, said in e-mailed comments.  
 In Singapore, the premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to
380-centistoke grade was unchanged after rising yesterday to
$8.25 a ton, the highest since May 6, PVM data showed. A wider
 viscosity spread  indicates bunker prices decreased more than
higher-quality fuel oil.  
 Losing Streak  
 Gasoil , or diesel, dropped for a sixth day, the longest
losing streak since a seven-day pullback through May 21. August
swaps declined $1.12, or 1.4 percent, to $81.10 a barrel, based
on PVM data. The product’s premium to Dubai crude was down for a
second day at $11.45. This  crack spread , a measure of processing
profit, was at the lowest since June 14.  
 Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after slipping
yesterday to 85 cents a barrel, according to PVM. A narrower
 regrade  indicates aviation fuel was less profitable.  
 Benchmark Japan open-specification naphtha forwards for
first-half August delivery were bid at $609 a ton against offers
of $612, according to broker Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.
That’s lower than yesterday’s close of $619. Singapore naphtha
swaps were at $3.16 a barrel below Dubai crude. At a  premium ,
this spread would signal refining gains.  
 Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday increased to $10.30
a barrel, the highest in five days, according to Bloomberg
calculations. A widening  reforming margin  shows refiners
preferred making the motor fuel.
