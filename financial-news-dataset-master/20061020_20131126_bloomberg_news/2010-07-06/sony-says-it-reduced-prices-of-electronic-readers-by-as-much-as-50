             Sony Corp.  cut prices of its e-
readers in the U.S. for a second time since the introduction of
Apple Inc.’s iPad in April intensified competition in the market
for devices that can display digital books.  
 The Japanese consumer-electronics maker lowered its Reader
Daily Edition e-reader to $299 from $349 earlier this month and
made smaller reductions on two other models, after trimming
prices in May, Sony spokesman  Sean Yoneda  said by phone today
from Tokyo.  
 Sony is competing with  Amazon.com Inc. , the Seattle-based
maker of the Kindle e-reader, and Barnes & Noble Inc., the No. 2
U.S. bookstore chain, both of which have cut prices for their
devices. The e-book makers are fending off competition from the
iPad, a tablet computer with a color screen on which users can
read digital books, watch videos and surf the Internet.  
 E-reader sales will probably double this year to 6 million
units, according to Forrester Research Inc. Kindle has about 60
percent of the U.S. market, followed by Sony with 35 percent,
the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research firm estimates.  
 Sony  dropped 2.3 percent to 2,306 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break in Tokyo, compared with a 0.9 decline by Japan’s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  
 Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, on July 1
introduced an updated version of its larger Kindle with sharper
contrast and a lower price than the previous model. The Kindle
DX will sell for $379, down from $489, Seattle-based Amazon.com
said.  
 Sony in May said it plans to begin selling its e-readers in
China, Japan and Australia this year, widening its challenge to
Kindle. China is projected to be the biggest market for
electronic-book readers by 2015, Sony said at the time.
