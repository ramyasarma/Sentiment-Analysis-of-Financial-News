             Copper advanced for a third day as
demand for the industrial metal reduced inventories to a seven-
month low and a gain in equities spurred confidence in the
global economic recovery.  
 Three-month delivery copper gained 1.1 percent to $6,538.75
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:02 p.m. in
Shanghai. Stockpiles tracked by the LME fell to 444,500 tons
yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 2. Bookings to remove
copper from LME warehouses slid 4.8 percent to 33,325 tons after
touching the highest level in almost four months on July 1.  
 “Declining stockpiles have lent support to the market that
fell 5.3 percent last week,” said  Hwang Il Doo , a senior trader
at KEB Futures Co. in Seoul.  
 Copper for September delivery added 1.5 percent to $2.9590
a pound on the Comex in New York. The U.S. market was closed
yesterday for the Independence Day holiday.  
 Asian stocks  rose, driving up the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
by the most in two weeks, as investors bet equities had become
cheap relative to earnings prospects. The  Shanghai Composite
Index , which tracks the bigger of China’s stock exchanges, rose
1.9 percent, rebounding from a 15-month low.  
 Copper was also supported by a drop in the dollar as the
Dollar Index, which gauges the currency against those of six
major trading partners, lost as much as 0.5 percent to 84.23.  
 Copper, used in pipes and wires, lost 16 percent in the
second quarter, the first drop since 2008, on concern an
economic recovery would slow in the second half. Manufacturing
growth weakened last month in China, Europe and the U.S., which
account for as much as two-thirds of global demand.  
 Recovery Concern  
 “If the pace of the global economic recovery slows,
investors will reduce their expectations for consumption of the
metal and prices may fall further,” said Li Qiang at Xinhu
Futures Co. in a report today.  
 Still, while futures anticipate prices no higher than
$6,519.50 a ton through the end of 2011, 13 of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expect a shortage next year. Lower prices
may curb mine spending, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
predicts a price of $8,050 in 12 months.  
 The metal for October delivery fell 10 yuan to close at
52,250 yuan ($7,711) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Shanghai aluminum gained 0.7 percent to 14,915 yuan, while zinc
advanced 1.1 percent to 15,390 yuan.  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery in London rose 1 percent
to $1,956 a ton, zinc gained 2.1 percent to $1,845 and lead
rallied 1.3 percent to $1,787 a ton. Nickel advanced 1.7 percent
to $18,985 a ton and tin climbed 0.7 percent to $17,450.
