Fulvio Conti said October is the “right time” to hold an
initial public offering for the biggest Italian utility’s Enel
Green Power unit.  
 Enel Green Power, which manages wind, solar, biomass,
hydroelectric and geothermal power producers in 17 countries,
can be “floated successfully even in turbulent times like we
are in now,” Conti told reporters in Moscow today.
