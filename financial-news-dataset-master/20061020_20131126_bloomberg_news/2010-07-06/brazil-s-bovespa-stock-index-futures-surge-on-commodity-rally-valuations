             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index surged
the most in three weeks as metals prices rose, spurring an
advance for commodity producers, and Banco BTG Pactual SA
recommended buying banks, homebuilders and food producers.  
 Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Brazil’s biggest lender by market
value, climbed after BTG Pactual analysts said it’s their “top
pick” among banks and Brazilian equities are “cheap.” JBS SA,
the world’s biggest beef producer, jumped 4.8 percent.  Vale SA ,
the world’s biggest iron ore producer, advanced the most in more
than two weeks as commodities prices jumped.  
 The Bovespa stock index rose 1.5 percent to 61,791.45 at
2:54 p.m. New York time. Fifty-three stocks advanced on the
index while 11 fell. The measure dropped yesterday on concern
higher borrowing costs will slow economic growth. The gauge sank
15 percent from an April 8 high through yesterday, dragging its
price to 11.7 times estimated earnings, compared to a ratio of
17.2 in December.  
 “After another weak month, Brazilian equities are looking
relatively cheap,” Pactual analysts  Carlos Sequeira  and  Antonio Junqueira  wrote in a note to clients today. “Brazil’s economy
is solid and growing fast.”  
 Metals prices tracked by the Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month
Price Commodity Index climbed 1.3 percent.  
 Vale gained 0.4 percent to 37.73 reais.  MMX Mineracao e
Metalicos SA , the iron ore company controlled by billionaire
 Eike Batista , jumped 3.2 percent to 10.68 reais.  
 Banks, Real Estate  
 Investors should increase holdings in banks and real estate
companies, including  PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes , which are showing “attractive valuations,”
Pactual wrote. The Rio de Janeiro-based bank, which forecasts
the Bovespa will rise to 86,000 in the next 12 months, a 41
percent jump from yesterday’s close, recommended buying airlines
including Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and pay-TV cable
company Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA.  
 PDG rose 3 percent to 16.02 reais. Gol rose 2 percent to
22.03 reais. Net advanced 1.8 percent to 18.41 reais.  
 Banks rallied after Banco Santander Brasil SA and Banco do

cited valuations.  
 Santander Brasil gained 2.6 percent to 19.50 reais. Banco
do Brasil rose 1.6 percent to 26.73 reais.  
 Banco Bradesco SA, Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Itausa -
Investimentos Itau SA were initiated with a “neutral” rating,
