             The European Union said the U.K. has
taken effective action toward cutting the country’s  record
budget deficit  after Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne QIJI9F3818IG"></a>.  
 “The current economic circumstances call for a decisive
fiscal consolidation, while not suffocating the nascent economic
recovery,” EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said in a statement released today in Brussels. “The
budgetary targets presented by the U.K. government are in line
with this strategy.”  
 Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition of Conservatives
and Liberal Democrats is proposing expenditure cuts and tax
increases totaling 113 billion pounds ($172 billion) to slash a
deficit of 11 percent of economic output. Some government
departments have been told to plan for spending cuts of as much
as 40 percent.  
 Osborne’s fiscal consolidation plans set out on June 22 are
closely in line with proposals suggested by the EU in December,
the Commission said the statement. “Provided they are
implemented as planned, the measures announced will strengthen
confidence in the U.K.’s commitment to putting its public
finances back on a sustainable path,” it said.
