             BYD Co., the Chinese automaker partly
owned by billionaire  Warren Buffett , started assembling cars in
Russia, BYD’s local partner TagAZ said.  
 TagAZ completed assembly of its first BYD F3 sedan, the
best-selling passenger car in China last year, the Taganrog,
southern Russia-based company said on its  website .  
 BYD may produce 10,000 cars at TagAZ by the end of the year
and replace South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. as the Russian
factory’s main partner, the  Kommersant  newspaper said today,
citing unidentified TagAZ workers. TagAZ makes about 40 percent
of the cars Hyundai sells in Russia, according to Kommersant.
