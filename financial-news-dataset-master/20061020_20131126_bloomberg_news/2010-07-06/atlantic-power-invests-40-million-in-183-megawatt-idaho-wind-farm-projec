                  July 6 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) --  Atlantic Power
Corp. , the independent electricity producer, bought a minority
stake in 11 wind farms under construction in Idaho for about $40
million.  
 Atlantic Power used cash and $20 million from a senior
credit facility to pay for a 27 percent interest in joint
venture Idaho Wind Partners 1, the Boston-based company said in
a statement.  The power-generating sites will have a capacity of
183 megawatts.  
 Atlantic Power’s investment follows  General Electric Co.’s 
acquisition of a majority stake in Idaho Wind last week. Project
manager Reunion Power LLC of New Jersey and Montana-based
developer Exergy Development Group own minority stakes.  
 Fagen Inc. began building the project this month near the
towns of Hagerman and Burley. Commercial operations are slated
to start by the end of this year, and utility Idaho Power Co.
has agreed to purchase the output from the wind farms under a
20-year contract.  
 The wind-farm cluster will use 122 of GE’s 1.5-megawatt
turbines, and the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company will
provide operational and maintenance services for seven years.
