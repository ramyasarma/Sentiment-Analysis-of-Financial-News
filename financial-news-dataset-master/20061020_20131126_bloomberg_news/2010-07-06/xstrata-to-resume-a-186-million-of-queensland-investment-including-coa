             Xstrata Plc , the biggest exporter of
power-station coal, resumed work on a A$6 billion ($5 billion)
mine and Rio Tinto Group revived a study for an iron ore
expansion after Australia reduced a planned resource profits tax.  
 Initial work and exploration totaling A$186 million will
restart at three coal projects in Queensland state, Zug,
Switzerland-based Xstrata said today in a statement. Rio is
reopening studies for expansion of its iron ore operations in
the Pilbara region,  Sam Walsh , chief executive of its iron ore
unit, told reporters today in Perth.  
 Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  last week agreed to cut the
tax to 30 percent from 40 percent, a week after ousting  Kevin Rudd  as the nation’s leader to defuse a row with mining
companies that damped the government’s election prospects. A
development decision for the A$6 billion Wandoan project is
expected in the second half of 2011, Xstrata said.  
 “Today’s decision effectively lifts the suspension on
expenditure announced by Xstrata last month and allows the next
stage of planning for this internationally significant Wandoan
project to proceed,” Xstrata Coal Chief Executive  Peter Freyberg  said in the statement.  
 Shares in London-based Rio fell 0.2 percent to A$65.10 at
the 4:10 p.m. Sydney time close on the Australian stock exchange.  
 Capital Spending  
 Rio’s capital spending this year may be between $5 billion
and $6 billion, the company said in March. An expansion of Rio’s
iron ore mines in Western Australia’s Pilbara region will boost
capacity to 330 million tons by 2015 from 220 million tons.
Final approval is due in the second half this year, Citigroup
Inc.’s  Clarke Wilkins  said in a report in May. The broker last
year estimated the expansion may cost A$12 billion.  
 “With the certainty we’ve now got with the minerals
resource rent tax, we are now configuring those numbers and
impact back into our projects,” Walsh said. “There is still an
amount of work to be done in relation to tying up the valued
engineering work.” He didn’t give a time for when the project
may be approved.  
 Gillard’s compromise means the minerals tax will now only
apply to coal and iron ore mines and affect 320 companies
instead of the 2,500 under Rudd’s proposal. Projects also will
be entitled to a 25 percent extraction allowance that reduces
taxable profits.
