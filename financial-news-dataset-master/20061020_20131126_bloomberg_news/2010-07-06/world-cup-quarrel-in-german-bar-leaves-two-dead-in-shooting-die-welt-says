             A second Italian man has died of
wounds suffered in a shooting that followed an argument over the
soccer World Cup in a Hanover, Germany bar, Die Welt reported,
citing police.  
 A 49-year-old man died in hospital overnight, the report
said, adding that his companion, 47, had died after the incident
early yesterday. Police said a German man left the bar after
quarreling with the Italians over the number of World Cups won
by their respective countries, returned a short time later, and
shot both the men in the head, the newspaper reported.  
 Police are seeking a German man, 42, identified as Holger
B., Die Welt said.
