             Japan may hold a shortened session of
parliament this month, which would delay the passage of
legislation including reforms to the national postal service,
Nikkei English News said, citing officials it didn’t identify.  
 There may be a three-day session of parliament starting
July 26, less than the 50 days that had been considered by the
ruling Democratic Party of Japan, the report said. The next
extended parliamentary session may be held after the party
selects its president in September, the report said.
