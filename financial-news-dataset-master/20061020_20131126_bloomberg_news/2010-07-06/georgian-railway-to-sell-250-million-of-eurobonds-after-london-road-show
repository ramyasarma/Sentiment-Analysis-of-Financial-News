             Georgian Railway LLC  plans to offer
$250 million of seven-year Eurobonds following a road show in
London July 7-8, said Nikoloz Mchedlishvili, a spokesman for
Prime Minister  Nika Gilauri .  
 Mchedlishvili declined by telephone to say what the state-
owned rail company plans to do with the proceeds from its first-
ever Eurobond sale.  Irakli Ezugbaia , general director of
Georgian Railway, declined to comment on the timing or purpose
of the sale, managed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Merrill Lynch.  
 Georgian Railway received a  100-million-euro loan  from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in March to
finance the construction of a railway bypass. The company sold
25 million lari ($13.5 million) of bonds with a 13.5 percent
coupon in a private placement last year, Bloomberg data show.  
 “The decision to sell in July is more likely connected to
investor interest than a specific plan for the money,”  Davit Narmania , executive director of the Caucasian Institute for
Economic and Social Research in Tbilisi, said by telephone.
“The interest is out there for sure.”  
 Georgian Railway, which is about 138 years old, links the
Black Sea with the Caspian Sea.
