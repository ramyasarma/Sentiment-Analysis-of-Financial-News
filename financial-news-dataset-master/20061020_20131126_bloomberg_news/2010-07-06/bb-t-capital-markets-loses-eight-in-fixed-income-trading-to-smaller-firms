             Eight  BB&T Corp.  fixed-income traders
and salesmen have quit since May to join smaller firms building
bond-trading units, said  Bill Hardy , who became the bank’s head
of debt capital markets when his predecessor,  Ted Luse , departed
last month.  
 Those who left BB&T, the second-largest North Carolina
bank, include  Doug Bretz  and  Daniel Cardani , who headed fixed-
income trading and sales, respectively. Luse, Bretz and Cardani
joined  Cortlandt Capital Holdings , a New York-based investment
firm, two people briefed on the matter said last week.  
 “They were approached and were made an offer too good to
turn down,” Hardy said in an interview July 1. “We’ve grown
aggressively over the last few years and while we’ve had some
defections, we continue to build,” said Hardy, who joined the
Winston-Salem-based  lender  in 1999 and was named to his new post
on June 17.  
 BB&T is trying to expand its corporate and capital markets
business to supplement a community-banking unit that makes up
about 58 percent of revenue, Chief Executive Officer  Kelly King ,
61, said at a UBS AG investment conference in May. Financial
services, including asset management, retail brokerage and
capital markets, make up about 9.2 percent of revenue.  
 “BB&T has a mentality with its employees that we love you,
but if you don’t want to stay, then get out and we’ll find
somebody else,” said  Chris Marinac , an analyst at FIG Partners
LLC in Atlanta. “They have a very good ability to backfill and
stay the course.”  
 Bretz declined to comment. Telephone calls to Cortlandt
partner  Brad Bodine , Luse and Cardani weren’t returned.  
 Sterne Agee, Cortlandt  
 The employees who left in the past two months were based in
BB&T’s office in Richmond, Virginia, a focus of the bank’s
capital markets and investment advisory business since it bought
local brokerages Scott & Stringfellow and Craigie Inc.  
 Robert  Jackson, who ran investment-grade products, was
among five BB&T salesmen, traders and analysts who joined  Sterne
Agee & Leach , a Birmingham, Alabama-based firm that opened a
Richmond office in May, the firm said on May 18.  
 Sterne Agee, Stifel Nicolaus and Jeffries Group Inc. are
among companies that expanded their fixed-income businesses
during the past two years by hiring from larger firms, said
 Daniel Arbeeny , managing principal at CMF Partners LLC, a New
York-based recruitment firm.  
 “There’s been a ton of growth by smaller shops,” Arbeeny
said. “The question is how many of these firms are going to
stick with it over the longer term.”  
 Ryan Specialty Group , a start-up brokerage founded by
former Aon Corp. CEO  Pat Ryan , hired about 120 BB&T commercial-
insurance employees in several states since January, according
to Ed McCormack, a managing director at the Chicago-based
brokerage.
