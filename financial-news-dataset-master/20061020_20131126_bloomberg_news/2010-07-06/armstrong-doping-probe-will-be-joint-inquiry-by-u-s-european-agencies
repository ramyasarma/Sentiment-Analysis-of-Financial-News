             A doping probe into seven-time Tour
de France champion  Lance Armstrong , sparked in part by former
cyclist  Floyd Landis’s  allegations, will be a cooperative effort
between U.S. and European agencies.  
 David Howman , director general of the  World Anti-Doping
Agency , said at a news conference today in Lausanne,
Switzerland, that his organization and Interpol, the
international police agency, are helping to connect
investigators on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.  
 “This investigation has been going on for many weeks and I
think it is a significant inquiry,” Howman said in remarks
reported by Agence France-Presse and confirmed by WADA spokesman
 Frederic Donze  in an e-mail message. “And it’s one that might
go on for many more weeks because it essentially started with a
U.S. inquiry and is spreading.”  
 WADA and Interpol have been working together on doping
inquiries since late 2008, Donze said.  
 Landis was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title after
testing positive for a banned substance.  
 Landis told U.S. officials and international cycling
authorities this year that Armstrong and other former teammates
on the U.S. Postal Service squad also had participated in
doping. Armstrong and former team officials have rejected the
allegations.
