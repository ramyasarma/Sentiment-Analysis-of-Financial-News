             Rubber advanced on optimism that
Japan and China may soon replenish their inventories and that
supplies in Thailand, the largest exporter, remain limited.  
 “On fundamental aspects, declining stocks in Japan and low
level of inventories in China supports optimism they will soon
replenish inventories,” said Varut Rungkhum, analyst at
Bangkok-based commodity broker Agro Wealth Ltd.  
 The December-delivery contract rose as much as 1.3 percent
to 270 yen per kilogram ($3,077 a metric ton) before settling at
268.1 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures fell as much
as 2 percent as the slowdown in China’s car sales growth stoked
concern that demand may weaken from the world’s largest user.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost 0.4 percent to settle at 21,525 yuan ($3,177) a ton.  
 Crude rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses fell
8.9 percent to 3,247 tons on June 20, according to data from the
Rubber Trade Association of Japan.  
 China’s natural-rubber inventories increased 1,211 tons to
15,982 tons last week, based on a survey of 10 warehouses, the
Shanghai Futures Exchange said on July 2. Still, stockpiles have
slumped 89 percent this year.  
 “The tight supply situation continues for a while,” said
 Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager of research at Tokyo-based
IDO Securities Co.  
 Rain in southern Thailand has disrupted tapping, limiting
supplies, the Rubber Institute of Thailand said today.  
 The benchmark price in Thailand was unchanged at 112.60
baht ($3.47) a kilogram, according to the  Rubber Institute of
Thailand,  which issues new data in the afternoon. Auctioned
prices of ribbed smoked sheets fell 0.1 percent to 107.20 baht.  
 Tight global supplies and strong demand, especially from
China, will support prices, the  Association of Natural-Rubber-
Producing Countries  said in its June newsletter. China’s gross
import of natural rubber is projected to climb 5 percent this
year to 1.67 million tons, the association said.  
 The possibility of a “marked improvement” in supply in
the short term is limited given aging trees and weather
constraints, the association said June 30.
