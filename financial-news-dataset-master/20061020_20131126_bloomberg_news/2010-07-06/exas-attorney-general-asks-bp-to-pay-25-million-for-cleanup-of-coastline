             Texas’s attorney general asked  BP Plc 
for $25 million to clean up oil that has washed up on the
state’s coastline since the explosion of a rig in the Gulf of
Mexico triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 “While we do not yet know -- and cannot yet calculate --
the ultimate damage this ecological and economic disaster will
inflict upon the state of Texas, we do know that BP will be held
fully financially accountable for the costs incurred by the
taxpayers,” Attorney General  Greg Abbott  said today in a
statement.  
 The Deepwater Horizon rig blew up in April, killing 11
people and discharging a gusher of oil into the gulf. Clots of
oil from the runaway well, known as tar balls, appeared on
beaches of Galveston Island yesterday. Five gallons of tar balls
have washed ashore so far, Abbott said, citing state agencies
monitoring the beaches.  
 “We will of course take a look at their proposal and work
with the state on any impacts associated with the spill from the
Deepwater Horizon accident,’’  Daren Beaudo , a BP spokesman, said
in an e-mail today. “Cleaning up oil spilled as a result of
this incident is our responsibility.’’  
 Beaudo said the U.S. Coast Guard, which is managing BP’s
response to the spill, tested the Galveston tar balls and
concluded they most likely were brought to Texas by ships
instead of drifting from Louisiana on ocean currents.  
 Fresh Oil  
 “It was confirmed that the oil was Deepwater Horizon, but
very fresh, not consistent with weathered oil reaching Texas
from the well site,’’ Beaudo said. “Suspicion is that it
travelled in ships’ ballast or on hulls on the approach’’ to the
Houston Ship Channel, which cuts the coastline at the east end
of Galveston Island, he said.  
 BP, which has primary responsibility as owner of the well,
has said it will pay all cleanup costs and legitimate damage
claims. Abbott said he contacted the London-based company’s
Houston offices this morning “to ensure that BP fulfills its
promises.”  
 The company has made similar block grants to the four other
Gulf Coast states for cleaning beaches, marshes and coastal
waters, Abbott said.  
 The attorney general said he also asked  Kenneth Feinberg ,
administrator of the $20 billion BP oil-spill damages fund, to
open a claims office in Texas.
