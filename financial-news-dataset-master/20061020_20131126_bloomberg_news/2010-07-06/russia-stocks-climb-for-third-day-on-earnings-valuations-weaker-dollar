             Russian stocks climbed for a third
day as investors bet equities had become cheap relative to
earnings prospects and oil gained for the first time in six
days.  
 OAO Severstal , Russia’s biggest steelmaker, rose 3 percent.
Oil producer OAO Gazprom Neft advanced 2.9 percent, helping to
push the  Micex Index  of 30 stocks higher by 2.1 percent to
1,320.15 as of 4:17 p.m. in Moscow. Stocks have rebounded 5
percent in the last three days, the longest winning streak in
more than a month.  
 “S&P 500 futures are up 1.04 percent, so you pick up
cheap, high beta plays and Russia is the high beta king,” said
 Luis Saenz , a London-based director of international sales at
brokerage Otkritie Securities Ltd., said in an e-mailed comment.
“But volumes today are very low in general and a touch of
Russia-specific negative news could drive it down.”  
 Oil rose for the first time in six days, erasing an
earlier loss of as much as 1.5 percent as the dollar weakened.
Crude for August delivery gained as much as 1.5 percent, to
$73.22 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Barclays Capital began coverage of Russian oil and gas
stocks with a “positive” view, according to an e-mailed
research note today.  OAO Rosneft , the country’s biggest oil
producer, gained 2.5 percent to 192.3 rubles after it was rated
“overweight” with a price estimate of $9 per share. OAO
Gazprom and OAO Lukoil were ranked “equalweight,” while gas
producer OAO Novatek was initiated at “underweight.”  
 Copper  
 Copper for delivery in three months added $103, or 1.6
percent, to $6,572 a metric ton on the London Metals Exchange.
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , Russia’s biggest miner, added 2.2
percent to 4,171.20 rubles. All of the six main metals traded on
the LME advanced, led by zinc.  
 Russian stocks retreated last week to their lowest level in
five weeks as oil plunged after reports showed manufacturing in
China and the U.S. slowed in June, indicating the world’s two
largest energy consumers may need less crude. The Micex has slid
15 percent from its April 15 peak.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.5 percent to 113.57, its
biggest gain since June 21. The gauge reversed a drop of 0.9
percent this morning that cut the average price of its stocks to
13.6 times estimated profit, the lowest level since December
2008.
