             India’s rupee traded near a three
week low as exchange data showed foreign investment in the
nation’s shares slowed amid concern the global economic recovery
is faltering.  
 Net daily additions to overseas ownership of Indian
equities declined last week to $55 million from $181 million
during the previous five-day period, according to data released
by the  Securities and Exchange Board  of India. Japan’s factory
output and household spending declined in May and the jobless
rate increased, while new U.S. home sales tumbled 33 percent to
a record low, government reports showed last month.  
 “The rupee is unlikely to gain for now because foreign
funds seem to be increasing sales in the equity market,” said
 Roy Paul , deputy general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Investor confidence isn’t really strong at the moment.”  
 The rupee was little changed at 46.7950 per dollar as of
10:27 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reached 49.9 yesterday, the lowest since June 11. The rupee’s
5 percent loss in the past three months is the second-worst
performance among Asian currencies after South Korea’s won.  
 Offshore forwards indicated the Indian currency will trade
at 47.37 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 47.38 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy
or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.
