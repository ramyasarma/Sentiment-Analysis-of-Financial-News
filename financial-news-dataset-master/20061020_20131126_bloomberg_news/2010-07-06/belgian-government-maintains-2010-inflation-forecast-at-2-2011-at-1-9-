             Belgium’s federal planning bureau
maintained its forecast for the average increase in consumer
prices this year at 2 percent, the same rate it projected on
June 1.  
 The agency also kept its 2011 inflation projection
unchanged at 1.9 percent, according to a statement posted on the
Brussels-based bureau’s website today.  
 The bureau lowered its forecast for the average oil price
this year to $75 a barrel from $77 and raised its estimate for
the euro to $1.29 from $1.28 on average.
