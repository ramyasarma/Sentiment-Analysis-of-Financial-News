             Brazilian President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  said he’ll back Uruguay in the remaining matches of the
World Cup after Brazil’s national side crashed out of the
tournament last week.  
 “I have not managed yet to digest the Brazilian defeat,”
Lula told reporters today in Nairobi, Kenya, where he is on the
third stop of a six-nation African trip. Brazil, which was one
of the favorites to win the event, lost 2-1 to the Netherlands
in their quarter-final match on July 2.  
 Uruguay plays the Netherlands in Cape Town in the first
semi-final of the World Cup tonight, while Germany meets Spain
tomorrow in Durban. Lula is scheduled to attend the final in
Johannesburg on July 11.  
 “We will all be fans for Uruguay so that Uruguay can be the
champion,” Lula said. “I have nothing against European
countries, but I want everything in favor of Mercosur,” he said.  
 Mercosur is a regional trade bloc that groups Uruguay,
Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. Uruguay was the only country of
the four to make it beyond the quarter-final stage of the World
Cup, which will be hosted by Brazil in 2014.  
 “We do have the hope that in the year 2014, when we will be
hosting the World FIFA cup, that maybe we could win the
tournament,” Lula said.
