             Bank of America Corp.  hired former
Credit Suisse Group AG executive Mark Rosen to head the
financial institutions group’s corporate and investment banking
in Latin American as the firm expands outside North America.  
 Rosen, who is based in New York, reports to  William Egan ,
the group’s global head of corporate and investment banking,
Bank of America said in a statement today.  
 Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is
adding dozens of senior bankers in Asia, Europe and Latin
America to expand internationally after buying Merrill Lynch &
Co. in 2009. Last week it hired  Peter MacDonald , a former co-
head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Asian securities unit, as
vice chairman for Asia-Pacific.  
 Rosen spent 12 years at Credit Suisse after heading mergers
and acquisitions for Latin America at UBS AG and investment
banking for Latin America at  Barclays Plc , according to the
statement. Last year he advised Madrid-based Banco Santander SA
on the initial public offering of Banco Santander Brasil SA,
which raised $8 billion, Bank of America spokesman  John Yiannacopoulos  said.  
 Credit Suisse named  Didier Mena  as head of its Latin
American financial institutions group, according to a July 1
internal statement verified by the Zurich-based company.
