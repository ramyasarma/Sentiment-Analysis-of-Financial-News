             Australia’s dollar erased initial
declines after the Reserve Bank left interest rates unchanged
and said the nation’s output growth “is likely to be about
trend.”  
 The so-called Aussie traded at 83.91 U.S. cents as of 2:48
p.m. in Sydney from 83.70 cents before the RBA decision and
83.93 cents yesterday in New York.
