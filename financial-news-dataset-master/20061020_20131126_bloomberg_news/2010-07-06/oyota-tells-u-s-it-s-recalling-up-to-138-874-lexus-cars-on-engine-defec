             Toyota Motor Corp.  told U.S.
regulators it is recalling as many as 138,874 Lexus vehicles for
2006-2008 after reports of an engine defect that can lead to
stalling.  
 Toyota said July 2 it would notify the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration of the recall this week. As many
as 270,000 Lexus model vehicles worldwide may have the defect
and will be recalled, the company said.  
 Vehicles being recalled include GS350s from 2007 and 2008,
IS350s from 2006 through 2008, GS450h models from 2007 and 2008,
GS460s from 2008, LS460s from 2007 and 2008, LS460Ls from 2007
and 2008, and LS600hL models from 2008, according to the Toyota
 notice  sent to the regulator.  
 Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, said yesterday it
will recall Lexus cars sold in Japan and China, including 91,903
Lexus GS 350, GS 450h, GS 460, IS 350, LS 460, LS 600h and LS
600hL models because of problems with valves that may cause the
engine to stall, according to a statement on the website of the
nation’s Transportation Ministry yesterday.
