             Sovereign debt risks for Japan and
India are moderated by domestic demand for the countries’
government bonds, according to Standard & Poor’s.  
 The base of domestic purchasers in Japan and India provides
stability and a “strong mitigating” influence on sovereign
risks, Elena Okorotchenko, a credit analyst at S&P, said at a
conference in Hong Kong today. She added that Asian nations are
in a “strong position” should there be another wave of the
global financial crisis.
