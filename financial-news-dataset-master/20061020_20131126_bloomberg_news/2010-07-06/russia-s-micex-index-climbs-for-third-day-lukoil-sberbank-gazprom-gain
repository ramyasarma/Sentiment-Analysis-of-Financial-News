             Russia’s 30-stock Micex Index
advanced for a third day, its longest winning streak in more
than a month, as crude oil rose, boosting the outlook for
producers.  
 The gauge was up 0.7 percent at 1,301.72 by 10:44 a.m. in
Moscow. OAO Lukoil, the country’s second-largest oil producer,
and OAO Gazprom, its natural gas export monopoly, gained. OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, advanced as much as 1.6
percent.  
 Crude oil, Russia’s chief export earner, reversed losses as
the dollar weakened and Asian equities rebounded from a one-
month low as investors took the view valuations were attractive.
Oil traded 14 cents higher at $72.28 a barrel in New York.
