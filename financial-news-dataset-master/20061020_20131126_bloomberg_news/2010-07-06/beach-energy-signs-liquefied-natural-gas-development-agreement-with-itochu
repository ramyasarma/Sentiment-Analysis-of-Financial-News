             Beach Energy Ltd. , an Australian oil
and gas producer, signed an agreement with Japanese trading
company Itochu Corp. to study a liquefied natural gas project.  
 The memorandum of understanding will allow the companies to
“research the potential for us to jointly invest in an
integrated LNG project opportunity,” Beach Managing Director
 Reginald Nelson  said in a statement today. Nelson wasn’t
immediately available for further comment.  
 Beach, which has declined 27 percent this year in Sydney
trading, said in March it aims to find a partner to develop
shale gas resources in Australia’s Cooper Basin that may rival
the Barnett and Haynesville rock formations in the U.S. states
of Texas and Louisiana. Today’s statement didn’t identify where
the LNG development may be located.  
 Beach gained 0.8 percent to 67 Australian cents at 1:10 p.m.
in Sydney. Itochu fell 1.9 percent to 678 yen in Tokyo.  
 Adelaide-based Beach is exploring a region of central
Australia that may hold 200 trillion cubic feet of gas and is
aiming to become the largest shale gas producer in the country,
Nelson said March 31. Beach targets first shale gas sales in
2015, he said.
