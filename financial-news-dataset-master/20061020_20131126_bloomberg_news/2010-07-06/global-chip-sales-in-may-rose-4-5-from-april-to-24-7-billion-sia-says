             Global semiconductor sales climbed
4.5 percent in May from the previous month helped by higher
demand for chips used in computers and mobile phones, the
 Semiconductor Industry Association  said.  
 Total sales advanced to $24.7 billion in May from $23.6
billion in April, the San Jose, California-based association
said in a Business Wire statement today. Sales from a year
earlier jumped 48 percent, it said.  
 “Global sales of semiconductors in May reached a new high
and remain on pace to reach the SIA forecast” for this year,
 George Scalise , president of the association, said in the
release. “Recent chip sales have shown robust demand, but the
year-on-year growth rates also underscore the very depressed
market conditions of the first half of 2009.”  
 On June 10, SIA forecast sales of microchips will rise 28
percent to $290.5 billion this year. It predicted year-on-year
growth in coming months will “reflect the industry recovery
that gained momentum in the second half of last year.”  
 China, India and other emerging markets are “fuelling”
demand for computing and communications products, according to
SIA. It said chip sales benefited from strong sales in
computer, mobile-phone and industrial markets. It predicted
unit sales of PCs will advance 20 percent this year while
handsets will climb 10 percent to 12 percent.
