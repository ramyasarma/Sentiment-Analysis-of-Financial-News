             Treasuries  rose, pushing benchmark
10-year note yields toward their lowest level this year, as
signs economic growth is slowing increased demand for the
relative safety of government debt.  
 U.S. two-year yields traded near a record low as stocks
pared an advance. Private-sector data today showed that
expansion in U.S. service industries, the largest part of the
economy, slowed in June. America lost jobs last month for the
first time this year, a government report said on July 2.  
 “There is a lack of desire from the investment community
to go away from Treasuries, given the lack of inflation and the
economic concerns and the safety concerns,” said  John Spinello ,
chief technical strategist in New York at Jefferies Group Inc.,
one of 18 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve.  
 Ten-year note yields fell 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.93 percent at 4:58 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. They touched 2.8793 percent
on July 1, the least since April 2009. The 3.5 percent security
due May 2020 rose 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 104
26/32. Thirty-year yields decreased 5 basis points to 3.89
percent.  Two-year note  yields, which touched a record low 0.5856
percent on June 30, slipped 2 basis points to 0.61 percent.  
 About $163 billion of Treasuries changed hands today
through ICAP Plc as of 4:03 p.m. in New York, compared with an
average daily  volume  of $249 billion over the past three months,
according to data from the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  
 ISM Index Falls  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 53.8 in June from 55.4 the prior month, the
group said today. Readings above 50 signal expansion. Economists
in a Bloomberg News survey projected the Tempe, Arizona-based
ISM’s gauge would fall to 55.  
 Net payrolls in the U.S. dropped by 125,000 in June, the
first fall since December, the Labor Department said last week.  
 U.S. stocks earlier rose from a 10-month low, rebounding
from a 5 percent drop for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index last
week. The  index  climbed as much as 2 percent today before paring
gains to 0.5 percent on concern the recovery is flagging.  
 “This really concerns incoming data; Treasuries aren’t
following risk assets lock-step,” said  Michael Pond , an
interest-rate strategist in New York at primary dealer Barclays
Plc. “More investors are calling for a double-dip. For now,
there is nothing out there to change market sentiment.”  
 Treasuries returned 5.9 percent in the first half of 2010,
the most since 1995, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. Investors snapped up U.S. bonds as European efforts to
cut government spending sent stocks plunging. The  MSCI World 
Index fell 11 percent over the same period.  
 ‘Lot of Concern’  
 “There is a lot of concern still over what is going on in
Europe and whether the economy is going to slow significantly,
which is why we are at these yield levels,” said  Ira Jersey , an
interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG, another
primary dealer.  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, narrowed to 1.72 percentage points from
this year’s high of 2.49 percentage points set in January.  
 The U.S. will sell $12 billion in 10-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, on July 8. The auction
follows an $8 billion offering of the security on April 5 that
drew a yield of 1.709 percent, compared with an average forecast
of 1.75 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of primary dealers.  
 U.S. government bond yields are signaling almost no chance
of the economy slipping into another recession, according to
research from the Cleveland Fed.  
 Yield Curve  
 The  2.32 percentage-point  spread between yields on 2- and
10-year Treasuries is more than double the 20-year average and
about the same as in 2003, just before gross domestic product
rose 3.6 percent. The so-called yield curve suggests growth
won’t slow to less than 1 percent and about a 12 percent chance
of a recession in the next year,  Joseph G. Haubrich , head of the
banking and financial institutions group at the Cleveland Fed,
and  Kent Cherny , a researcher, wrote in a July 1 report.  
 “We could get a sharper move to higher yields once growth
dynamics take hold,”  James Caron , head of U.S. interest-rate
strategy at primary dealer Morgan Stanley in New York, said in a
July 2 interview on Bloomberg Television.  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange showed a 16 percent
chance of the Fed raising its target lending rate for overnight
bank loans by at least a quarter-percentage point by December,
compared with a 31 percent likelihood a month ago. The rate has
been at a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December.  
 A close by 10-year Treasury note yields between 2.98
percent and 3.02 percent would signal they may be near a bottom,
according to FTN Financial.  
 Ten-year yields tumbled to 3.02 percent June 28 from 3.11
percent June 25. In a telephone interview today,  Jim Vogel , head
of agency-debt research at FTN in Memphis, Tennessee said
reaching 3.02 percent “would be an indication that you would
fill in the gap that was created on the 28th.”
