             Cash premiums for soybeans shipped to
export terminals near New Orleans rose relative to Chicago
futures after farmers halted sales of dwindling inventories of
last year’s crop. Corn premiums widened after futures fell.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 75 cents to 89 cents a bushel above August futures,
compared with 74 cents to 83 cents on July 2, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn premium rose to 38 cents to 41
cents a bushel September futures from 38 cents to 40 cents on
July 2.  
 “Farmers are not selling soybeans” after rains delayed
planting and stunted early development of this year’s crop, said
 Tim Emslie , a research manager at Country Hedging Inc. in Inver
Grove Heights, Minnesota. “We did see a little corn selling
early, but that dried up after futures fell.”  
 Soybean futures for August delivery fell 4 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $9.405 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
oilseed climbed 1.5 percent in the previous two sessions after
the USDA said that inventories as of June 1 dropped to the
lowest level since 2004.  
 Corn futures for September delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.68 a bushel. The contract jumped 6.6 percent last
week after the USDA said farmers planted less this year than
they intended.
