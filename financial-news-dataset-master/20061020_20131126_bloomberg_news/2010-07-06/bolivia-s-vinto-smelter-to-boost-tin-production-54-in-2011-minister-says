             Bolivia’s Vinto tin smelter will
increase production to 20,000 metric tons a year during 2011
after it adds a new $25 million blast furnace, Mining Minister
Jose Pimentel said.  
 This represents a 54 percent rise over the 13,000 metric
tons of tin Vinto is projected to produce this year, Pimentel
said today in an interview in La Paz. Construction of a new
blast furnace is under way at the smelter, he said.  
 “We think that with construction of the new blast furnace
next year we will produce 20,000 tons,” said Pimentel.  
 The Vinto smelter was seized by President  Evo Morales’s 
government from Glencore International AG in 2007. Bolivia was
the world’s seventh-largest refined tin producer in 2009. The
world’s top producer was China, followed by Indonesia, Malaysia
and Peru.  
 The Vinto tin smelter will increase production 10 percent
in 2010 from the previous year, said Pimentel. Vinto produced
11,805 metric tons of refined tin in 2009 and 9,544 metric tons
of refined tin in 2008.
