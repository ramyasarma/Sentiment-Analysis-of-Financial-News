             Trade between Kenya and Brazil, which
grew sixfold to $91 million between 2002 and 2009, “still lags
behind possibilities,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva said.  
 “Now is the time for the challenge to diversify exports
from Kenya to Brazil and stimulate Brazilian investments in
Kenya,” da Silva said in a speech delivered in Nairobi today.  
 Brazilian construction companies could play a role in
building infrastructure such as ports, roads and electricity
generation in the East African nation, helping its economy grow,
he said.
