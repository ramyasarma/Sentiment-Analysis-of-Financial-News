             Singapore’s dollar may gain as much
as 6 percent versus Australia’s currency in the next four to six
weeks after the short-term moving average on a technical chart
crossed a longer-term line, according to Okasan Securities Co.  
 Singapore’s currency may advance to S$1.1386 against the
Australian dollar in a couple of weeks and S$1.1057 in four to
six weeks, said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency dealer at
Okasan, citing 10- and 20-day moving averages and a series of
numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence.  
 The Singapore dollar was little changed at $1.1690 versus
the Australian currency, or Aussie, as of 12:48 p.m. in
Singapore, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It pared
gains of as much 0.6 percent after Australia’s central bank kept
interest rates unchanged.  
 “The chance of breaking the initial target in a week or
two weeks is very high,” Tokyo-based Soma said in an interview.
“The Singapore dollar is on a long-term trend of appreciation
against the Aussie.”  
 The city-state dollar’s 10-day moving average rose today
beyond its 20-day equivalent to form a “golden cross,” which
is a bullish signal for the Asian currency, Soma said.  
 A repeated failure for the Singapore dollar to weaken
beyond S$1.2218 last month also signals the currency will
advance, Soma said, citing the Fibonacci sequence.  
 Fibonacci Analysis  
 The S$1.2218 level is a 50 percent reversal of the
Singapore dollar’s gain from this year’s low of S$1.3049 reached
on April 12 to this year’s high of S$1.1386 on May 21. A break
there will then bring S$1.1057 into target over the next four to
six weeks, Soma said.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Other significant levels are 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent, 61.8
percent, and 76.4 percent.  
 On the chart, S$1.1057 represents a 50 percent retracement
of the Singapore dollar’s decline from a high on Oct. 28, 2008,
of S$0.9066 to the April 12 low on a separate Fibonacci chart.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
