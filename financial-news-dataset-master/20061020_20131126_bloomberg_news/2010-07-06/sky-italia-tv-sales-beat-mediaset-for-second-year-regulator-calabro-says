             News Corp. ’s  Sky Italia SpA  generated
higher television revenue in 2009 in Italy than rival  Mediaset
SpA  for a second year, the communications regulator said.  
 Sky Italia had revenue of 2.71 billion euros ($3.41
billion) last year, compared with  Mediaset ’s 2.51 billion euros,
according to the regulator’s annual report presented in Rome
today. Mediaset is the TV company of Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi . State-owned broadcaster  RAI SpA  had sales of 2.73
billion euros, the regulator said.  
 “Italy’s television sector is essentially tripartite in
terms of resources,”  Corrado Calabro , the regulator’s chairman,
said in a speech at the presentation. “Total sales from pay-TV
and advertising have further reduced the gap.”  
 Revenue in the Italian TV industry rose 1.7 percent in 2009
as pay-TV sales jumped 7.4 percent to 2.88 billion euros, the
regulator said. Ad sales dropped 9.3 percent to 3.54 billion
euros.  
 Mediaset runs three free-to-air TV channels and is
expanding in digital-terrestrial broadcasting, where it has free
channels as well as a pay-TV offering called Premium, which
generated about 12 percent of its revenue in 2009. About 60
percent of RAI’s revenue comes from license fees, while 90
percent of sales at  Rupert Murdoch ’s satellite broadcaster Sky
Italia come from pay subscriptions.
