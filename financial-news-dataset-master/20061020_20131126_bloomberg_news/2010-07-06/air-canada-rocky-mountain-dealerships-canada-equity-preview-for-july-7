             Canadian stocks  rose for a third day
as fertilizer producers gained with surging prices for
agricultural commodities and oil advanced after the
International Monetary Fund raised world growth forecasts.  
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer, increased 3.6 percent as corn rose to the
highest price in almost six months. Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company by market value,
climbed 2.4 percent after U.S. initial jobless claims dropped
more than expected. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest
producer, declined 3.4 percent as the euro climbed to an eight-
week high against the U.S. dollar.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rallied 36.1
points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,433.37. The S&P/TSX jumped  2.8
percent  over the previous two days, the most in two days since
Feb. 2, after sinking to an eight-month low.  
 “People are actually saying things are not that bad,”
said  Marcus Xu , director of equity investments at Genus Capital
Management in Vancouver, which manages about C$1.6 billion
($1.53 billion). “Maybe the job numbers will continue to
improve; corporate profits are still doing pretty well. We don’t
need to be that afraid anymore.”  
 The S&P/TSX has lost 2.7 percent this year, compared with 4
percent for the S&P 500, as a 3.8 percent increase in  S&P/TSX
gold stocks  has moderated the Canadian benchmark’s slump.  
 Potash, Agrium  
 Potash Corp. and Agrium Inc. advanced with corn and wheat
prices, which have surged 15 and 20 percent, respectively since
June 29 amid worldwide weather conditions inhibiting crop
yields. A U.S. government report on world agricultural supply
and demand is scheduled to be released tomorrow.  
 Potash Corp. increased 3.6 percent to C$94.18. Agrium,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, climbed 6.7 percent
to C$57.64.  
 The IMF today raised its  forecast  for 2010 word economic
growth to 4.6 percent from 4.2 percent. The organization raised
its estimate for Canada to 3.6 percent from 3.1 percent.  
 First-time  unemployment claims  in the U.S. declined to
454,000 last week from 475,000 the week before, the Labor
Department said today in Washington. Economists had forecast
applications would total 460,000, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Crude oil futures gained after the releases, rising 1.9
percent from yesterday’s settlement price to $75.44 a barrel.  
 Canadian Natural, Suncor  
 Canadian Natural advanced 2.4 percent to C$36.69. Suncor
Energy Inc., the country’s  biggest oil and gas company ,
increased 1.2 percent to C$32.88. Cenovus Energy Inc., the oil
company spun off from EnCana Corp. in December, climbed 1.6
percent to C$29.  
 The  S&P/TSX Banks Index  rose for a third day after TD
analyst  Jason Bilodeau  said recent share-price drops in the
industry present an opportunity for investors.  
 Royal Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National
Bank of Canada each gained after Bilodeau upgraded their shares
to “buy” from “hold.”  Royal Bank  advanced 1.2 percent to
C$53.08. CIBC, Canada’s fifth-largest bank, increased 0.7
percent to C$66.88. National Bank, the No. 6 bank in Canada by
assets, climbed 1 percent to C$57.03.  
 Gold fell as much as 1 percent before closing down 0.2
percent at $1,196.10 an ounce. Futures dropped as European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled the economic
recovery on the continent is gaining momentum. The euro gained
against the U.S. dollar, British pound and Swiss franc.  
 Market Drag  
 The  index  of 29 S&P/TSX gold companies tumbled to its
lowest level since April 27. Barrick decreased 3.4 percent to
C$44.41. Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s second-largest gold producer,
declined 2.4 percent to C$42.30. Eldorado Gold Corp., which

 Kirkland Lake Gold Inc., which explores for the metal in
Canada, sank 9.6 percent, the most in 10 months, to C$7.77 after
announcing a loss of  3 cents a share  for the fourth quarter. The
average estimate among four analysts in a Bloomberg survey was
for a 1-cent-a-share profit.  
 Wireless equipment maker DragonWave Inc. plunged 15 percent
to C$4.95, the lowest price in almost a year, after it forecast
 second-quarter revenue  of about $25 million, missing the average
analyst estimate of $46.8 million. DundeeWealth Inc. and GMP
Capital Inc. reduced their ratings on DragonWave shares.  
 Forsys Metals Inc., which is developing a uranium mine in
Namibia, tumbled 16 percent to a 10-year low of C$1.53, bringing
its weekly decline to 31 percent.  
 The company said yesterday it hasn’t found a buyer after
completing its review of strategic alternatives. Discussions
with potential bidders continue, the company said. Analyst
 Patrick Donnelly  of Salman Partners Inc. reduced his rating on
the shares to “hold” from “buy” today.
