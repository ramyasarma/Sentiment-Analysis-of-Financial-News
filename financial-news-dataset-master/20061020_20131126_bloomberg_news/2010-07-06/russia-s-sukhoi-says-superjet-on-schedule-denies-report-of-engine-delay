             Sukhoi Co. said production of the
SuperJet, Russia’s first major commercial airplane project since
the collapse of the Soviet Union, is on schedule, denying a
newspaper report of delays.  
 “We haven’t changed the timeframe for SuperJet
deliveries,” said  Olga Kayukova , a spokeswoman for Moscow-based
Sukhoi, by phone today. “The first one will be delivered by the
end of the year.”  
 The Vedomosti newspaper reported today that Sukhoi may
have to delay SuperJet production because of technical problems,
including with the engine. The European Aviation Safety Agency
certified the motor last year and Avia Register, Russia’s
certification agency, is scheduled to do the same this month,
Kayukova said.  
 Sukhoi has 101 “firm” orders for the 75- to 95-passenger
jet and expects to win more at the Farnborough International
Airshow in the U.K., which starts July 19, the company said last
week. Russian flagship carrier OAO Aeroflot will be the first
airline to fly the aircraft commercially, Sukhoi Chief Executive
Officer  Mikhail Pogosyan  said in an interview June 11.  
 Fifteen SuperJets, designed to challenge Airbus SAS and
Boeing Co. in the mid-range market, are scheduled for delivery
in 2011, Pogosyan said.
