             Ukraine’s  inflation rate  fell in June
for a fourth month to the lowest in four years as the impact of
last year’s accelerating price growth waned.  
 The rate dropped to 6.9 percent in June, the lowest since
June 2006, from 8.5 percent the previous month, the Kiev-based
statistics committee said in a statement on its Web site today.
The median estimate of seven economists in a  Bloomberg survey 
was for 7.5 percent. On the month, prices fell 0.4 percent.  
 “Annual inflation slows because of a favorable base
comparison,” said  Iryna Piontkivska , an economist at Troika
Dialog in Kiev, before the release. “Last year, consumer prices
rose 1.1 percent in June from May, which is quite a lot.
Inflation will probably quicken from July as the base comparison
will be less favorable and as utility tariffs increase in
Kiev.”  
 The government expects inflation of about 9 percent this
year, Deputy Prime Minister  Serhiy Tigipko  said on June 4.
Successive governments have failed to keep inflation below 10
percent since 2003.  
 Producer prices, an early indicator of inflation, increased
an annual 25.5 percent in June and fell 0.5 percent from the
previous month, according to the statistics committee.
