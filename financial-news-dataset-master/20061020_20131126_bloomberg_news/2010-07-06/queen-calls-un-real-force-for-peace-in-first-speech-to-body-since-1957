             Queen Elizabeth II of Britain praised
the United Nations as a “real force” for promoting peace and
delivering aid in her first speech to the world body since 1957,
a dozen years after its founding.  
 “When people in 53 years look back on us, they will
undoubtedly see many of our practices as old fashioned,” the
queen said in a speech today to the General Assembly. “It is my
hope that when judged by future generations, our sincerity, our
willingness to take the lead and our desire to do the right
thing will stand the test of time.”  
 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed the queen in
welcoming remarks as “an anchor for our age,” and noted that
her reign spanned the decades “from the Beatles to Beckham,” a
reference to English soccer star David Beckham, and from
“television to Twitter.”
