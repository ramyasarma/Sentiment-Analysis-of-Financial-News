             Tesla Motors Inc., the first U.S.
automaker to complete an initial public offering in more than a
half century, retreated for a fourth straight day to fall below
its IPO price of $17 a share.  
 The maker of the $109,000 electric Roadster bought by Brad
Pitt and George Clooney slid 13 percent to $16.75 at 3:04 p.m.

California-based company had rallied 41 percent on June 29 after
selling shares above the forecast price range for its $260
million offering.
