             Anshan Iron & Steel Group , part of
China’s fourth-largest steelmaker, said it’s making its
investment decision in the U.S. based on market needs after a
group of U.S. lawmakers opposed the plan.  
 The “investment decisions in the United States are
commercial in nature and are based on market needs,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement last night. “We are
committed to mutually beneficial relationships with our business
partners and with our stakeholders in the community.”  
 Anshan Steel in May agreed to build a reinforcing bar plant
with Steel Development Co., making a first investment by a
Chinese company in a U.S. mill. The investment poses a national
security risk as Anshan Steel is controlled by the Chinese
government, a group of 50 U.S. lawmakers said in a letter to
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.  
 “U.S. only welcomes China to buy its bonds and commercial
products while protecting its less-competitive companies,” said
 Le Yukun , a Shanghai-based analyst at BOC International Ltd.
“It doesn’t want to see Chinese companies gradually erode its
local brand products.”  
 The U.S. has slapped duties on some Chinese steel products
in the past year, arguing that the Asian nation subsidizes its
producers. Chinese steel product  exports  have doubled in the
first four months of the year as the global economy recovers.  
 Steel Development is a privately owned company led by
Chairman  John Correnti , a former executive at Nucor Corp.,
according to its  website .
