             The Swiss franc weakened against the
euro after a report showing slower-than-expected consumer-price
increases spurred speculation the nation’s central bank may
intervene in the currency market to prevent deflation.  
 The franc fell as much as 0.3 percent versus the European
currency as Swiss data showed prices increased 0.5 percent in
June from a year earlier, slowing from the annual 1.1 percent
pace in May. Economists had forecast inflation to be 0.9
percent, according to the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. Over the month, prices dropped 0.4 percent.  
 “The franc weakened because of the weak inflation
number,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG in
London. “People are thinking about deflation risks again, and
the risk of the Swiss National Bank coming back in.”  
 The franc weakened 0.2 percent to 1.3379 per euro as of
2:22 p.m. in Zurich. It declined earlier to 1.3392. It reached
1.3074 per euro on July 1, the strongest the franc has been
since the single currency’s introduction in 1999.  
 SNB policy makers led by President  Philipp Hildebrand  on
June 17 said deflation risks have “largely disappeared,”
ending a 15-month policy of countering what they called
“excessive” gains by the franc. They also raised their 2010
growth forecast to 2 percent from 1.5 percent.  
 The Swiss central bank’s foreign-currency holdings declined
in June after policy makers stopped selling Swiss francs for
euros and dollars. Holdings fell to 225.8 billion francs ($212.7
billion) from 232.1 billion francs in May, the Zurich-based SNB
said on its Web site today.
