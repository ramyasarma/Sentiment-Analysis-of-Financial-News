             Sony Corp.  will introduce a new model
of its PlayStation 3 video-game console on July 29 in Japan,
offering more memory at the same price as the previous machine.  
 The company will sell a 160-gigabyte model for 29,980 yen
($342), the same price at which the Tokyo-based company had
previously offered its 120-gigabyte console, according to a
faxed statement today. A 320-gigabyte model will sell for 34,980
yen, Sony said.  
 Sony’s effective price cut follows a similar move by rival
 Microsoft Corp. , which last month introduced a new model of its
Xbox 360 video-game console in Japan for 29,800 yen and cut the
price of its existing player by 17 percent. Sony and Microsoft
are competing to win share from video-game leader  Nintendo Co .  
 Kyoto-based Nintendo last month sold 73,336 Wii consoles in
Japan, while Sony sold 71,779 PS3s, according to Tokyo-based
research firm Enterbrain Inc. Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft sold 22,673 Xbox 360 players.  
 Sony was unchanged at 2,330 yen as of 1:01 p.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the  benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  rose 0.2 percent. Shares of Nintendo fell 0.7 percent in
Osaka trading.  
 The price of the 120-gigabyte PS3 will be “open” from
tomorrow, according to Sony’s statement, meaning retailers are
free to set it.
