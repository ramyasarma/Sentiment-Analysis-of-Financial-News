             Hong Kong's stocks fell, pushing
the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  to its biggest drop in more than two weeks,
after the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers
said the credit-market rout will slow economic growth.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc (5)  slipped after UBS AG cut its rating to
``neutral'' on rising customer defaults and slower growth at
the U.S. consumer-finance unit.  
 U.S. economic ``growth will slow and there will be some
negative impact because of the subprime credit crisis,'' said
 Geoff Lewis , head of investment services at JF Asset Management
Ltd., which oversees $100 billion in Asia. ``It will take time
to get back to normal.''  
 Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  led declines among mainland Chinese
lenders on concern the nation's central bank will raise
 interest rates  to rein in growth.  
 The Hang Seng Index slid 744.22, or 2.5 percent, to
28,720.83 at the 12:30 p.m. break, headed for its biggest
decline since Oct. 3. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index,
which measures 43 so-called H shares of Chinese companies, fell
2.7 percent to 19,181.98.  
 HSBC, Europe's biggest lender by market value, lost
HK$3.90, or 2.6 percent, to HK$146.70. Its North America
earnings in the first-half slumped 35 percent to $2.44 billion
because of loan defaults by subprime borrowers, the lender said
on July 30.  
 UBS cut its rating on HSBC from ``buy,'' according to an
Oct. 19 research note by analysts at the brokerage including
Alastair Ryan.  
 'Market Turbulence'  
 Li & Fung Ltd., which sells goods to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
fell HK$1.35, or 4.2 percent, to HK$31.05. Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Ltd., the world's largest maker of sports shoes for
brands such as Nike Inc., slipped 80 cents, or 3.4 percent, to
HK$22.85.  
 ``Recent financial market turbulence, high  oil prices  and
weakness in the U.S. housing sector will likely moderate'' the
global expansion, G-7 officials said in a statement after
meeting in Washington Oct. 19.  
 The G-7 accounts for about two-thirds of the $53 trillion
world economy and comprises the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany,
Italy, France and Canada. Officials met as U.S. stocks fell the
most in two months after lower earnings reports heightened
concern about the health of financial markets and the economy.  
 Bank of China , the nation's third-largest lender, dropped
23 cents, or 4.9 percent, to HK$4.51. China Construction Bank
Corp., the second biggest, slid 21 cents, or 2.9 percent, to
HK$7.09. Industrial and Commercial  Bank of China  Ltd., the No.
1, fell 17 cents, or 2.5 percent, to HK$6.63.  
 Rate Rise Likely  
 China's economy  probably expanded 11.5 percent in the
three months to Sept. 30 from a year earlier, according to the
median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News ,
raising the likelihood of more interest-rate increases to
prevent a flood of export cash from fueling asset bubbles. The
statistics bureau may release the figures this week. Higher
interest rates curb banks' lending operations.  
 Elsewhere, China Life Insurance Co., the nation's biggest
insurer, slipped 70 cents, or 1.4 percent, to HK$50.60. BNP
Paribas SA cut its recommendation on China Life to ``hold''
from ``buy'' because the company's market share will continue
to drop, Dorris Chen, an analyst at the brokerage, said in a
research note released today.  
 All stocks on the 40-member Hang Seng Index declined.
October futures fell 2.2 percent to 28,650.
