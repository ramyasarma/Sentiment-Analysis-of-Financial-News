             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce , the world's
largest  iron-ore  producer, said one of its Brazilian iron-ore
ports will halt shipments until February to repair damage caused
by a collision in the harbor.  
 The repairs will disrupt shipments of 60,000 metric tons a
day from the Itaguai port in Rio de Janeiro state, Vale said
today in an e-mailed press release. The Rio de Janeiro-based
company said Itaguai is the smallest of the company's four
ports, handling 25 million metric tons a year of iron ore.  
 At the end of last year, Vale had at least 20 shipments
delayed due to heavy rains and protests by landless peasants.  
 Vale is investing $59 billion over five years to increase
output of metals such as iron ore, nickel and alumina and to
expand the capacity of ports and railways. The company was
expected to mine 300 million metric tons of iron ore, used to
make steel, in 2007.  
 Shipping costs for commodities will rise to a record this
year before falling as the number of vessels outpaces demand,
Baltic Exchange Ltd. Chairman Michael Drayton said Dec. 4. The
 Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , which tracks rates, more than doubled last
year to a record 11,039 on Nov. 13.  
 Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world's third largest mining company,
announced today it will pay $315 million for three new vessels,
which will be delivered in 2012.  
 Vale's  preferred shares  fell 70 centavos, or 1.5 percent,
to 47.51 reais today on the Sao Paulo stock exchange. The stock
has lost 6.4 percent in the past week, after rising 88 percent
last year.
