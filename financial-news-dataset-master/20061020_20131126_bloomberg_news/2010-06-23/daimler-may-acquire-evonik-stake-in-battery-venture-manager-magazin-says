             Daimler AG is considering an
acquisition of Evonik Industries AG’s majority stake in their
Li-Tec battery venture, Manager-Magazin reported, citing
unidentified people at Daimler.  
 Evonik appears to not be interested in contributing to the
estimated 400 million euros in investment Li-Tec will need to
start mass production of batteries and is considering a sale of
its 50.1 percent holding, the report said, citing unidentified
people in the financial industry.
