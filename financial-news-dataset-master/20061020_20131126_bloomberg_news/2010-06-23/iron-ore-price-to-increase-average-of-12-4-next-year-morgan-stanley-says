             Iron ore  prices will increase an
average of 12.4 percent in 2011 after a 93.5 percent jump this
year supported by demand for steel in China, emerging and
developed markets, Morgan Stanley said.  
 Iron ore will average $126.70 a metric ton in 2011 from
$112.70 a ton this year, analyst  Peter Richardson  said in a
report dated today. Prices of steelmaking coal will rise 52
percent this year to $196 a ton, the report said.  
 “Continued growth in Chinese steel production in 2010 to
an estimated level of 621 million tons and a revival of demand
in the traditional centers of the seaborne iron ore market have
put strong upward pressure on available supplies,” the report
said. “China’s industrialization and emerging market growth
continue to power demand for all types of steel.”  
 The price of iron ore arriving at Chinese ports stood at
$143.80 a ton yesterday according to the  Steel Index . It has
climbed 21 percent this year.
