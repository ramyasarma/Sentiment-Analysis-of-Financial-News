million euros” from a new tax on banks that it is planning in
conjunction with the U.K. and Germany, the finance ministry
said.  
 Finance Minister Christine Lagarde’s reported comments in

6.71 euros. The French maker of materials for outdoor
advertising said its full-year net loss narrowed to about
350,000 euros ($461,000) from 720,000 euros a year earlier.  
 Total SA (FP FP), the stock with the biggest weighting on
