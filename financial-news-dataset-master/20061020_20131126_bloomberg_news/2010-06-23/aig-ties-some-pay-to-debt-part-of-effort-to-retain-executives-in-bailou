             American International Group Inc. ,
the insurer bailed out by the U.S. government, will pay some
executives in units whose value is tied mostly to debt, rather
than  common stock , as it seeks to retain managers.  
 Some compensation for the 25 top earners can be paid in
units “designed to serve as a proxy for AIG’s long-term
value,” the New York-based insurer said in a May 28 filing. The
units are 80 percent tied to junior debt that pays 8.175 percent
annual interest, and 20 percent to common stock, AIG said.  
 The insurer is seeking to retain staff while responding to
lawmakers who said it rewarded employees without regard to
performance. AIG, which is repaying loans within its $182.3
billion bailout, is under the jurisdiction of U.S. paymaster
 Kenneth Feinberg , who has set a $500,000 cash base salary cap
for most  executives .  
 “AIG is committed to compensation practices that allow the
company to attract and retain capable and experienced
professionals and motivate them to achieve strong business
results,”  Mark Herr , a spokesman for AIG, said in an e-mail.  
 AIG’s so-called long-term performance units will be paid in
cash, the insurer said. Executives including Chief Financial
Officer  David L. Herzog , property-casualty chief  Kristian P. Moor  and  Rodney O. Martin , who heads a non-U.S. life unit, are
among those getting the new units, AIG said.  
 The composition of the units was reported earlier by the
Wall Street Journal.
