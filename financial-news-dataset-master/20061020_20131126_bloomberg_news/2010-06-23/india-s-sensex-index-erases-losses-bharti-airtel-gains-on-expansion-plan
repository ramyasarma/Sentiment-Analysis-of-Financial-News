             Most Indian stocks rose. Bharti
Airtel Ltd. advanced after the nation’s biggest mobile-phone
operator said it plans to invest in southern Africa. Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. declined.  
 Bharti  rose the most in almost two weeks after the company,
which completed a $9 billion purchase of Mobile
Telecommunications Co.’s Africa assets this month, said it plans
to invest $100 million in Malawi over the next three years.
Larsen & Toubro, the largest engineering company, fell for a
second day, retreating from a two-year high.  
 “Deal activity is keeping the mood up,” said Jagannadham
Thunuguntla, chief strategist at SMC Capitals Ltd. in New Delhi.
“There is no real conviction and confidence among investors to
put in more money at higher levels.” He declined to name
specific stocks.

 BSE 200 Index  increased 0.2 to 2,245.93.  
 Bharti advanced 0.8 percent to 264.05 rupees. The planned
investment will be used to improve the quality of Malawi’s

Africa division, said yesterday.
