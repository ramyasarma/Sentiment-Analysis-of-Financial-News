             France’s civil aviation authority
said a strike tomorrow to protest retirement reform in the
country will disrupt flights.  
 The DGAC said in an e-mailed statement that it has asked
airlines to reduce flights to and from Paris’s airports Orly and
Roissy by 15 percent between 7 am and 2 pm.
