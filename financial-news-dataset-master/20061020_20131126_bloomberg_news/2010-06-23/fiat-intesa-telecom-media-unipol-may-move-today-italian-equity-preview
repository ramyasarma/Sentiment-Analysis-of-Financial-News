             Italy’s  FTSE MIB Index  dropped for a
second day, losing 250.11, or 1.2 percent, to 20,358.92 in
Milan.  
 The following stocks were among the most active on the
Italian market today.  
 Buzzi Unicem SpA  (BZU IM) and  Italcementi SpA  (IT IM),
Italy’s biggest cement makers, lost 1.7 percent to 8.83 euros
and 1.1 percent to 6.95 euros, respectively. Construction and
financial stocks led declines in Europe after new-home purchases
in the U.S. dropped to a record low.  
 Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM), Italy’s largest independent
fund manager, declined 1.8 percent to 7.25 euros.  Mediolanum SpA 
(MED IM) fell 2.3 percent to 3.37 euros.  
 Eni SpA  (ENI IM), Italy’s biggest oil company, slid 30
cents, or 1.9 percent, to 15.95 euros. Crude oil fell after a
U.S. government report showed an unexpected increase in
inventories.  Tenaris SA  (TEN IM), the world’s biggest maker of
seamless steel tubes for oil and gas extraction, retreated for
the first time this week, falling 41 cents, or 2.6 percent, to
15.37 euros.  
 Fiat SpA  (F IM) lost for a second day, falling 18.5 cents,
or 2 percent, to 9.33 euros. The Italian carmaker said it was
“impossible” to find an agreement with all unions representing
workers at its Pomigliano car plant after a referendum on the
company’s investment plan. Fiat will work with unions which
backed the company’s project, according to a statement
distributed by the carmaker via e-mail.  
 Pirelli & C. SpA  (PC IM), Europe’s third-largest tiremaker,
ended a three-session gain, losing 1.75 cents, or 3.6 percent,
to 47.3 cents.  
 Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM), the world’s second-biggest cable
maker, dropped 27 cents, or 2 percent, to 13.07 euros as copper
fell for the first time in three days in New York.
