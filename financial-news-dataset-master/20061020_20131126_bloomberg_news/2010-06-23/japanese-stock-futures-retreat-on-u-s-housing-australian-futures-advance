             Japanese  stock   futures  fell after
U.S. housing sales slumped more than expected, while Australian
futures rose. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who proposed raising
mining taxes, was ousted before markets opened.  
 American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. , a
carmaker that counts North America as its biggest market, lost
1.5 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of
Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s largest commodities trader, slumped
1.5 percent after commodity prices fell. ADRs of BHP Billiton
Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, climbed 1.7 percent.  
 “The drop in new home sales in the U.S. showed the
economic recovery is not yet self-sustaining,” said Mitsushige
Akino, who oversees $450 million at Tokyo-based Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “Sentiment may worsen further.”  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,880 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,910 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,880 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index decreased 0.1 percent in Wellington.  
 In New York yesterday, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
declined 0.3 percent to 1,092.04 after new-home sales sank to a
record low and the Federal Reserve signaled that European
indebtedness may harm American growth.  
 Home Sales Plunge  
 A U.S. Commerce Department report showed purchases of new
homes fell in May to a record low as a tax credit expired. Sales
collapsed 33 percent to an annual pace of 300,000 last month
from April, less than the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News and the fewest in data going back to 1963.  
 “Financial conditions have become less supportive of
economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments
abroad,” the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee said in a
statement yesterday in Washington.  
 Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was defeated by deputy
Julia Gillard today after a proposed tax on the mining industry
caused his opinion poll ratings to plunge.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has lost 2.9 percent this year,
compared with a drop of 2.1 percent by the  S&P 500  and a gain of
0.2 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.6 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.4 times for the S&P and 11.8 times for the Stoxx.  
 Crude oil for August delivery dropped 1.9 percent to $76.35
a barrel in New York yesterday. The London Metals Exchange Index,
a  measure  of six metals including copper and zinc, declined 1.1
percent yesterday.  
 The yen appreciated to as high as 89.79 against the dollar,
compared with 90.42 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo
yesterday. The stronger yen reduces income when overseas revenue
is converted into local currency.
