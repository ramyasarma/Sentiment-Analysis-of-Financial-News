             David Cameron  said he won’t take up
the special pension to which he will be entitled when he retires
as U.K. prime minister, as he told public-sector workers their
retirement benefits may be cut.  
 “There’s a special pension that was set up for the prime
minister; I am not taking it,” Cameron told an audience of
members of the public in a BBC television show today. “We’ve
got to confront this truth, if we don’t do anything about it
there’s going to be a massive great bill that we’ll have to pay
through taxes or public-spending cuts for the cost of public-
sector pensions.”  
 Work and Pensions Secretary  Iain Duncan Smith  will use a
speech in London tomorrow to set out the government’s ideas for
how to increase saving in private pensions. Cameron said that
with people on private pensions seeing the value of their
benefits fall, it was unfair not to look at how to cut the cost
of government-funded pensions.  
 The prime minister’s pension, payable immediately he leaves
office, however long he has served, amounts to half his salary,
or 66,461 pounds ($99,070) a year.
