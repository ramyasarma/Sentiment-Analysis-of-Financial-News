             French business confidence dropped
in June on concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will
prompt banks to reduce lending and governments to trim spending.  
 The  index of sentiment  among factory executives declined to
95 from 97 in May, statistics office Insee said today in a
statement. Economists expected a reading of 96, the median of 15
forecasts gathered by Bloomberg News showed.  
 Surging bond yields in Greece, Portugal and Spain prompted
euro-area governments last month to come up with a 750 billion-
euro ($924 billion) support package. Even so, banks across the
region have lent to those countries and may now cut back on
lending, while finance ministries are trimming budget deficits
to woo bond investors. Both reactions may hurt the real economy,
economists said.  
 “What’s certain is that the crisis has led to a
deterioration in financing conditions and to tighter fiscal
policies,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas
in Paris.
