             Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, a Turkish
bank part-owned by UniCreditSpA, was lowered to “equalweight”
from “overweight” at Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc.,
which said the stock had significantly outperformed its peers.  
 Morgan Stanley raised Yapi Kredi’s price estimate to 4.6
liras from 4 liras. It also increased the price estimate of
Akbank TAS to 7.7 liras from 6.4 liras, keeping its
“underweight” rating on the stock, and raised Turkiye Garanti
Bankasi AS to 8.7 liras from 8.2 liras, which it rates
“overweight.”
