             MTN Group Ltd. , Africa’s largest
mobile-phone operator, cut the bonus of Chief Executive Officer
 Phuthuma Nhleko  by 38 percent after profit growth slowed.  
 Nhleko, 52, was paid a base salary of 6.7 million rand
($890,000) and a bonus of 8 million rand for the fiscal year
through June, according to Johannesburg-based  MTN’s  annual
report, posted on its  website  today. In 2008, Nhleko earned a
salary of 6.5 million rand and bonus of 13 million rand.  
 Growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 6.7 percent to 46.1 billion rand last year,
according to the report; the previous year it climbed 36
percent. The company said the strength of the South African
rand in 2009 hurt profit as about 70 percent of earnings are
generated outside its home country of South Africa.  
 Nhleko’s “other benefits,” which are not defined in the
annual report, rose to 218,000 rand from 75,000 rand a year
earlier. Retirement benefits for the year rose to 749,000 rand
from 385,000 rand.  
 Nhleko will leave the company in March next year after
choosing not to renew his contract in June.
