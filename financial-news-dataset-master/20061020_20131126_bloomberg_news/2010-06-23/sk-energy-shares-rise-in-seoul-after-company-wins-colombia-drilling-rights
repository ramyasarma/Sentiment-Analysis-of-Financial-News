             SK Energy Co. rose to a six-week
high in Seoul trading after South Korea’s largest oil refiner
won drilling rights in Colombia.  
 The stock climbed 3.2 percent to 112,000 won as of 9:44
a.m. on the Korea Exchange, headed for the highest close since
May 13. SK Energy and other companies won the rights at an
auction in the northern Caribbean city of Cartagena yesterday,
Colombia’s National Hydrocarbons Agency said.
