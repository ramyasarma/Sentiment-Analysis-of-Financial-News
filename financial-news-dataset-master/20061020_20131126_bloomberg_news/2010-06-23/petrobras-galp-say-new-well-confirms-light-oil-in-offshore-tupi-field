             Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, said its seventh well in the
offshore Tupi field confirmed the potential of light oil in pre-
salt reserves.  
 The 3-BRSA-821-RJS well, known as Tupi Alto, is about 275
kilometers (170 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state,
Petrobras said today in a regulatory filing.  
 The seventh well reinforces earlier estimates that Tupi
holds 5 billion to 8 billion barrels of recoverable light oil
and natural gas, the company said. Petrobras operates the field
with a 65 percent stake, while BG Group Plc holds 25 percent and
Galp Energia SGPS SA has 10 percent.  
 Petrobras is seeking to invest as much as $224 billion
through 2014 to develop reserves including Tupi, the Americas’
largest find since Mexico’s Cantarell in 1976.
