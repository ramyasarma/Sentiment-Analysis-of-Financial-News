             Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. of
South Africa may alter or scrap its offer for Sigma
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. amid a potential class action lawsuit
against the Australian company, the Australian Financial Review
reported. Aspen, which is conducting due diligence on Sigma, is
“uneasy” about bearing the risk of the lawsuit before
formalizing its A$707 million bid, the newspaper reported
without saying where it got the information.
