             The city of Beijing extended
subsidies for disposal of high-emission vehicles to the end of
the year as it seeks to reduce pollution in China’s capital.  
 The incentives originally expired on May 31 after the
government had paid out 436 million yuan ($64 million) to help
people eliminate 113,300 high-emission vehicles,  the city’s
government  said on its website.  
 China’s government has been trying to curb emissions as
increased vehicle ownership and industrialization have added to
pollution. About 44 percent of Chinese cities have an air-
quality level of 3 or below, according to the State Information
Center. China has five levels, with 1 indicating the cleanest
air, 3 meaning “slight” pollution” and 5 representing
“heavy” pollution.  
 To reduce pollution and oil dependence, the nation has been
providing incentives since last year for consumers to buy cars
with engine capacities of no more than 1.6 liters.  
 China also aims to have more than 60,000 alternative-energy
vehicles, such as electric cars or plug-in hybrids, in use in 10
cities by 2012,  Miao Wei , a vice minister at the Ministry of
Industry and Information Technology, said last year.  
 Sales of such cars may account for 15 percent of the market
by 2020, according to Miao.
