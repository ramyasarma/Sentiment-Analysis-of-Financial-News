             The Australian dollar fell for a
second day as global stocks declined and Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd  said he faces a challenge as head of the Labor Party.  
 Deputy Prime Minster  Julia Gillard  requested the vote
challenging his leadership after a proposed tax on the mining
industry caused Rudd’s poll ratings to tumble. A plunge in U.S.
new home sales raised concern the global economic recovery is
faltering, reducing demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 “It probably makes sense to wait and see what the
actual numbers are in terms of party support,” said  Nick Bennenbroek,  head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo & Co. in
New York. “Australia’s been doing pretty well and it should be
able to absorb a change in leader.”  
 Australia’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to 86.81 per U.S. cents
at 10:44 a.m. in New York from 87.16 cents yesterday, after
touching 86.88, the lowest since June 18. The currency fell 0.9
percent to 78.20 yen. New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.8 percent to
70.96 U.S. cents and traded at 63.94 yen.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.5 percent to
1,089.46 in New York, extending this week’s slump to 2.7
percent.  
 Purchases of new homes in the U.S. fell in May to a record
low as a tax credit expired, showing the market remains
dependent on government support. Sales collapsed a record 33
percent to an annual pace of 300,000 last month from April, less
than the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News and the fewest in data going back to 1963, figures from the
Commerce Department showed today in Washington.  
 Carbon Trading  
 Support for Rudd began to slide after he shelved the
government’s carbon-trading plans in April, a key campaign
pledge when he won office in November 2007. Dissatisfaction with
Rudd hit a record 55 percent, according to a telephone survey of
1,147 people between June 18 and 20 published in the Australian
newspaper this week.  
 “While there’s a lot of attention in foreign-exchange
markets on political developments, for most of the developed
countries, be it the U.S. or in Europe or Japan, some of the
interpretation of the political significance is larger than the
actual impact,” Bennenbroek said.  
 Rudd told reporters in Canberra that he is “quite
capable” of winning tomorrow’s vote based on counting that’s
already been done.  
 Australian bonds rose for a second day. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year note fell six basis points to 5.33 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, fell one basis point to 4.27 percent.
