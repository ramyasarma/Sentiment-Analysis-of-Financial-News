             Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. , India’s
biggest refiner, will pay 24 percent less than agreed earlier
for a controlling stake in Brazil’s  Equipav SA Acucar e Alcool 
after prices of the commodity slumped from a 29-year high.  
 Shree Renuka will invest $250 million, less than the $329
million agreed in February, for the sugar and ethanol producer,
the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange today.  
 The purchase will help Shree Renuka secure supplies of raw
sugar as it lifts refining capacity to meet deficits in India,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. The refiner in March
completed a $82 million acquisition of Brazil’s Vale Do Ivai SA.  
 Equipav will give Shree Renuka 10.5 million tons of annual
crushing capacity in Brazil, the top producer, and help it meet
half its raw-sugar requirement of 1.7 million tons, Gautam Watve,
the company’s head of strategy and planning, said in February.  
 Shree Renuka’s  shares  rose as much as 2 percent to 70.15
rupees, the  highest level  since April 19, and traded at 68.45
rupees at 10:24 a.m. in Mumbai. The stock has slumped 38 percent
this year after tripling in 2009.  
 A shortage in India, the biggest user and second-biggest
producer, turned the country into a net buyer for the first time
since 2006 and sent global prices to a 29-year high in February.  
 Banco Itau BBA and Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
acted as strategic and financial advisers to Shree Renuka, the
company said in February.
