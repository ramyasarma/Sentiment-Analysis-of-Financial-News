             The rand weakened for a second day
after a report showed South African inflation eased to a four-
year low, stoking speculation the central bank may lower its
benchmark interest rate to bolster an economic recovery.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy depreciated as
much as 0.8 percent to 7.5935 per dollar before trading 0.4
percent down at 7.5661 by 12:15 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a
close of 7.5357 yesterday. The rand also slid against the euro,
losing 0.3 percent to 9.2987.  
 Consumer inflation  decelerated for a fifth consecutive
month, slowing to 4.6 percent in May from 4.8 percent in April,
the Pretoria-based statistics office said on its website today.
That matched the  median forecast  of 24 economists polled by
Bloomberg.  
 “Inflation is coming down so there is a possibility we
might see another rate cut,’” said  Ian Cruickshanks , head of
research at Nedbank Treasury in Johannesburg.  
 Price growth in South Africa has moderated as the rand
rallied almost 25 percent since the start of last year, lowering
the cost of imported oil, and as a bumper corn crop made the
staple food more affordable. That allowed monetary policy makers
to make a surprise 50 basis-point cut in the benchmark  rate  on
March 25 to 6.5 percent, the lowest since the repurchase rate
was first introduced in 1999.  
 Bonds, FRAs  
 Investors maintained bets the central bank will lower its
6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next meets, forward-
rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month contracts  for cash
in three months was steady at 6.39 percent. The rate reached a 6
1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.  
 The Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee holds its next
meeting on July 22 with the following one scheduled for Sept. 9.  
 Government bonds retreated for a second day, with the
benchmark security due September 2015 falling 14 cents to 123.35
rand. The yield on the bond increased 2 basis points to 7.93
percent.
