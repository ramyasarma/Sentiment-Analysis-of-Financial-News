             Most Australian Labor lawmakers have
swung their support behind deputy leader Julia Gillard ahead of
her challenge to party leader and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd
later today, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, without saying
where it got the information. Key factions of the party
persuaded a reluctant Gillard to stand, the newspaper reported.
