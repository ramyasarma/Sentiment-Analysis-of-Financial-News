             The Florida Marlins fired manager
 Fredi Gonzalez  and two coaches after the team posted a losing
record through 70 games this season.  
 Bench coach  Carlos Tosca  and hitting coach Jim Presley also
were let go by the Marlins (34-36), while Edwin Rodriguez was
promoted to interim manager, the team said in a  news release 
posted on its website.  
 Rodriguez, who was in his second season as a Triple-A
manager in New Orleans, has been with the Major League Baseball
organization for eight years.  
 Gonzalez posted a 276-279 record in three-plus seasons
leading the Marlins. Florida is 7 1/2 games behind the National
League East Division-leading Atlanta Braves.
