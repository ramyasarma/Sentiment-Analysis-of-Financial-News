             Credit Agricole Egypt SAE , the
country’s third-largest publicly traded bank, expects its loan
portfolio to grow more than 10 percent this year as economic
growth rebounds.  
 “The Egyptian market is promising,” Managing Director
 Henri Guillemin  said yesterday in an interview in Cairo. “But
we need to educate customers to present more reliable financial
statements.”  
 Credit Agricole Egypt’s loan book grew 17 percent to 8.2
billion Egyptian pounds ($1.4 billion) in 2009, according to its
annual report. That figure now stands at around 10 billion
pounds, Guillemin said.  
 Bank loans rose 2.5 percent in April to 451 billion pounds
from 439 billion in the previous month, according to  data 
published on the website of the  central bank . Loans to private
companies and households increased 1.5 percent in the same
period to 412 billion pounds, the data showed.  
 “Growth in credit to the private and household sectors has
been recovering since the end of 2009 with the improvement in
sentiment in the economy contributing to the rebound in economic
growth,”  Reham El-Desoki , senior economist at investment bank
Beltone Financial, wrote in a note this month.  
 Credit Agricole Egypt’s loan-to-deposit ratio has improved
to 45 percent from 22 percent in 2006, Guillemin said. The
average for Egyptian lenders is 55 percent, according to the
company’s 2009 annual report.  
 Shares of  Credit Agricole Egypt , which is 47 percent-owned
by Credit Agricole SA of, closed unchanged at 11.98 pounds. The
stock has increased 13 percent  this year  compared with a 1.8
percent gain for the  benchmark EGX30  stock index.  
 Credit Agricole Egypt competes with lenders such as
Commercial International Bank and National Societe Generale Bank
SAE.
