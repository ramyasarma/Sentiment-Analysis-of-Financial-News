             Daimler AG has no plans to buy a
stake from Evonik Industries AG in their Li-Tec auto-battery
venture, said Florian Martens, a spokesman at the carmaker.  
 Daimler’s relationship with Evonik is “constructive, open
and good,” Martens said today in an interview, responding to a
report in Manager-Magazin, citing undentified people at the
carmaker, that the auto manufacturer may acquire Evonik’s
majority holding in the venture.
