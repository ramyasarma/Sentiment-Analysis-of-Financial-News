             Talaat Moustafa Group Holding’s
Madinaty residential project won’t stop because of a ruling
annulling the company’s purchase of the land from the New Urban
Communities Authority, Al Mal newspaper reported, citing Housing
Minister Ahmed Al Maghraby.  
 The ruling doesn’t mean that the contract between Talaat
Moustafa and the New Urban Communities will be cancelled, the
Cairo-based business newspaper said today.
