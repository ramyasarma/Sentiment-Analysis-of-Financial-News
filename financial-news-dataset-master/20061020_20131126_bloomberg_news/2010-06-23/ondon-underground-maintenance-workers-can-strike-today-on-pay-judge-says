             London Underground maintenance
workers will go on strike today in a dispute about pay and
conditions on the train network, according to the  National Union
of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers .  
 Failure to reach an agreement will “have a major impact”
and “there’s a real danger that tube officials will take
serious risks with safety to try and run trains,” RMT General
Secretary  Bob Crow  said in a statement yesterday.  
 A new pay offer from  Tube Lines , which maintains and
upgrades three London routes, will be considered by RMT
representatives today, the union said.  
 About 1,000 workers will stage two 48-hour stoppages today
and July 14. The Piccadilly, Northern and Jubilee lines will be
worst-affected, the RMT said. The walkout starts at 7 p.m. local
time.  
 “London Underground intends to operate a full service to
customers across the whole network, including on the Jubilee,
Northern and Piccadilly lines, throughout the duration of the
strike, and all stations will remain open,” Transport for
London, which operates the subway network, said in a statement
on its website.  
 “Safety is London Underground’s top priority and we would
never run trains if it was not safe to do so,” an unidentified
spokesperson said on the site.
