             UBS AG  recommends equities of
European exporters that benefit from depreciation of the euro
and stocks of emerging markets, citing their strong earnings
growth prospects as well as attractive valuations.  
 “I find the current market sentiment too negative relative
to fundamentals and would recommend, for risk-tolerant investors,
using the recent sell-off to increase positions in emerging
market assets and among European export companies,”  Mark Andersen , head investment strategy, wrote in a research report
published yesterday.  
 European companies highly reliant on international sales
should benefit from depreciation of the euro, as measures to cut
budget deficits in the Eurozone will likely weigh on demand in
the region and also surrounding nations, wrote analysts led by
Andersen and Andreas Hofert, global head of wealth management
research at UBS. Many such companies are in Germany, Sweden and
the U.K., according to the report.  
 “With almost 70 percent of FTSE 100 sales being generated
abroad, U.K. equities have a very high international sales
exposure,” the analysts wrote. “The U.K. benefits from the
recent weakness of the British pound, trades at only nine times
next year’s earnings and offers an attractive dividend yield.”  
 In the long-term, emerging market stocks, such as China,
India, Russia and Poland, are attractive because domestic demand
supports growth and valuations are good, analysts wrote in the
report.
