             Gold futures fell to a one-week low
on speculation the dollar’s rally will erode demand for the
precious metal as an alternative asset.  
 The greenback headed for the fourth straight gain against a
basket of six major currencies. Before today, gold rose 13
percent this year, reaching a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June
21, on demand for a haven amid Europe’s sovereign-debt woes.  
 “Now that the euro has stabilized, the focus is back on
the dollar-and-gold relationship,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “There’s just not enough
fear and panic to send gold flying. There’s a little
disappointment among recent longs that gold is just backing and
filling, instead of advancing after making an all-time high.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August dropped $6, or 0.5
percent, to $1,234.80 on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
metal touched $1,225.20, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since June 15.  
 Gold has historically moved inversely to the dollar. This
year, the metal climbed to records in euros, U.K. pound and
Swiss francs.  
 Before today, the euro climbed 3.3 percent from a four-year
low on June 7.  
 “It is becoming apparent that at least some of the
aggressiveness among speculators as regards to pouncing upon the
euro and piling further into bullion is on the decline,” said
 Jon Nadler , a senior analyst at Kitco Inc. in Montreal.  
 Silver futures for July delivery dropped 44.3 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $18.504 an ounce, the biggest drop since June 4.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell $27.40, or 1.7
percent, to $1,574.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the largest decline in four weeks.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery tumbled $15.60, or
3.2 percent, to $474.35 an ounce.
