             Wheat rose for the first time in
four sessions on speculation that global production will decline
as adverse weather curbs output in the U.S., Canada and Russia,
the world’s biggest exporters of the grain.  
 Canadian growers seeded 7.1 percent fewer acres than last
year, Statistics Canada said today. Russia’s crop is forecast at
55.9 million tons, down 9.5 percent, because of drought, trader
WJ Group said today. U.S. output in the year that started June 1
may fall 6.7 percent on reduced seeding, the government said
earlier this month.  
 “Quality stocks are going to be hurt and Canada is a huge
exporter of quality wheat,” said  Louise Gartner , the owner of
Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek, Ohio. “I don’t see how
we’re going to come up with enough quality wheat” to meet
demand, she said.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 4.75 cents, or 1
percent, to $4.805 a bushel at 10:24 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Before today, the price gained 3.9 percent this month
on expectations for reduced world production.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
