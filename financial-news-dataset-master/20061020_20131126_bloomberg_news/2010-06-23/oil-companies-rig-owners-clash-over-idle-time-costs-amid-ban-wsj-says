             Oil rig owners and the companies who
lease them are fighting over who should pay for the losses 
incurred during the enforced idleness triggered by U.S. 
President Barack Obama’s moratorium on deepwater drilling, the 
Wall Street Journal reported, citing industry officials.  
 Although a federal judge overturned Obama’s ban, brought in
after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of 
Mexico, major oil companies are unlikely to resume operations 
until appeals to higher courts are completed; some rigs are 
costing as much as $600,000 a day while not in use, the 
newspaper said.  
 Industry officials say at least three major oil companies 
are seeking to exit rig leases in the Gulf, saying Obama’s 
moratorium voided the contracts, the WSJ said.
