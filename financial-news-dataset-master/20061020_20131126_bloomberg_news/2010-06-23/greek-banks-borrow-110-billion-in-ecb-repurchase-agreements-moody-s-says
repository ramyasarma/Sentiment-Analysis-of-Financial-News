             Greece’s banks have borrowed about
89.4 billion euros ($110 billion) in so-called repurchase
agreements with the European Central Bank, according to Moody’s
Investors Service.  
 Greek banks turned to the ECB for cash after the global
financial crisis that peaked in 2008 and this year’s sovereign
fiscal debacle curbed their access to wholesale funding and bond
markets. The nation’s banks have also been hurt by losing about
7 percent of their deposits, totalling an estimated 21 billion
euros, Moody’s said in a report yesterday.  
 “Changes to the funding profile of Greek banks have
widened maturity mismatches and depleted” their “market-
funding franchise,” Cyprus-based Moody’s analysts Constantinos
Kypreas and Mardig Haladjian wrote in the report. “The high
reliance on ECB funding is neither desirable nor sustainable
long term.”  
 Deposits dropped off due to a combination of customers’
“tax considerations,” their investing in Greek government
bonds and a corporate tax levied in January, the analysts wrote.
Clients also siphoned funds into Greek banks’ foreign units,
they wrote. The outflows, while slowing, “remain an issue,
given the fragility of depositor sentiment,” according to the
report.  
 Greece’s banks are building up “pools of instruments
eligible for refinancing at the ECB” via repurchase agreements,
Moody’s said. Under these agreements, money is lent against
collateral, which the borrower promises to buy back at a given
time. The New York-based rating company’s figures are as of May
10.
