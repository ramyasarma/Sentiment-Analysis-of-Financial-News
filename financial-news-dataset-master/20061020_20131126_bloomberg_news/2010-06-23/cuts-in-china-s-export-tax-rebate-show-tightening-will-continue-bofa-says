             China’s plan to remove export tax
rebates on some products shows that the government remains
confident on the strength of the nation’s economy and will push
forward with tightening measures, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
said in a report distributed today.  
 The cut in export tax rebates may also help ease trade
tensions between China and the U.S., economists at Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch led by Ting Lu wrote in the report.
