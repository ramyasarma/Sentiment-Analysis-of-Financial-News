             Mexico’s peso dropped for a second
consecutive day as sales of new homes in the U.S., the nation’s
largest trading partner, fell to the lowest level on record,
cutting demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  
 The currency fell 0.3 percent to 12.6451 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.6115 yesterday. The loss pared the
peso’s gain this year against the U.S. dollar to 3.5 percent,
making it the second-best performer among the 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  
 The housing data “is a clear indication that the recovery
in the U.S. is far from stable,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an
emerging-markets economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York.
“Mexico’s economic ties with the U.S. are deep. These guys are
attached at the hip, and a reading like this clearly has impetus
to shock the market.”  
 Sales of new homes in the U.S. plunged 33 percent to an
annual pace of 300,000 last month from April, the fewest in data
going back to 1963, and less than the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The U.S. buys about 80
percent of Mexico’s exports.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.277 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.23 centavos to 124.29 centavos per peso.  
 Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. SO far this month,
$521 million of the $600 million options for June have been
exercised.  
 The bank has been auctioning the options monthly, allowing
it to purchase dollars to boost foreign reserves after the peso
reached a record low last year.
