             A court in Pakistan is expected to
announce its verdict in the trial of five Americans charged with
terrorism offences within 24 hours after concluding hearings,
Agence France-Presse reported, citing defense lawyer Hassan
Katchela.  
 The U.S. citizens, aged 19 to 25, have been on trial in the
eastern city of Sargodha since their arrest in December for
plotting a terror attack, AFP said. All deny the accusations and
say they travelled to Pakistan to attend a wedding, the news
agency said.
