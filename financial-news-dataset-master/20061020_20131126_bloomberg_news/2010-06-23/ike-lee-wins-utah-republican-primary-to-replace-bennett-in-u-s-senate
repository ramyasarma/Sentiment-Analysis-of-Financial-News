             Republican voters in Utah picked
lawyer Mike Lee as the party’s nominee to replace U.S. Senator
 Bob Bennett , according to the Associated Press.  
 Lee, 39, defeated businessman Tim Bridgewater, 49, and will
likely become state’s next senator. Heavily Republican Utah
hasn’t elected a Democrat to the chamber in 40 years.  
 Lee had 51 percent of the vote in yesterday’s primary to
Bridgewater’s 49 percent, with 80 percent of precincts
reporting, according to AP.  
 Bennett, a three-term Republican, was rejected for re-
nomination at the state party’s convention in May. He drew
opposition from conservatives who criticized his  vote  for the
2008 bank bailout and a Medicare prescription drug benefit in
2003 that increased the federal budget  deficit .  
 Bennett, 76, endorsed Bridgewater after his defeat.  
 The winner faces Democratic nominee Sam Granato, a small
business owner, in November’s general election.
