             India’s rising prices are a concern
that the central bank will have to weigh against the risks to
growth from the European debt crisis, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said.  
 Inflation “is a matter of concern,” Mukherjee said in an
interview in Washington yesterday. “I do hope that the steps
we’ve taken both on the demand side and supply side will have a
moderating influence.”  
 India’s benchmark wholesale-price  inflation  unexpectedly
accelerated 10.16 percent in May from a year earlier, near the
fastest pace in 17 months, government data showed. The Reserve
Bank of India will raise interest rates in a “calibrated” way
given the cash squeeze in the economy and the threat posed by
Europe’s crisis, Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said June 18.  
 “It is a matter of time” before the central bank
increases rates, said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Mumbai-
based Yes Bank Ltd. “The central bank is waiting for normalcy
in the liquidity situation before raising rates.”  
 Indian lenders are short of cash after telecommunication
companies including  Bharti Airtel Ltd.  paid $14.6 billion of
license fees for wireless phone services and businesses withdrew
money for taxes.  
 The next monetary policy announcement is scheduled for July
27. The Reserve Bank has increased rates twice since mid-March
to control prices.  
 Overnight Rates  
 Overnight interbank rates advanced to 5.3 percent in Mumbai
yesterday, higher than the repurchase rate of 5.25 percent at
which lenders borrow from the central bank.  
 “We shall have to strike a balance between these two
situations,” Mukherjee said, referring to economic growth and
the acceleration in prices. “We are watching the situation,”
he said, adding any comment on rate increases would be
“premature.”  
 India’s inflation may slow to about 5 percent by March, the
finance minister said earlier this week in a speech at the
Institute of International Finance in Washington.  
 The country’s $1.2 trillion economy expanded 8.6 percent in
the three months through March from a year earlier, the fastest
pace after China and Brazil among major economies. The nation’s
growth rate may be “8.5 percent plus” this year and reach 9
percent next year, Mukherjee said yesterday.  
 Expansion in the manufacturing and services industries has
“contributed substantially to the higher growth,” Mukherjee
said. In setting its own borrowing schedule, the government will
ensure that Indian businesses are “not elbowed out of the
market” for credit requirements, he said.  
 “The cost of credit is moderate” for companies, he said.
