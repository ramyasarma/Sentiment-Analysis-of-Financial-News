             Australian real estate investment
trusts may pay out about A$1 billion in dividends to investors
in the next few months, the Australian Financial Review
reported, citing company statements. The trusts may seek to
increase payout rates as the market stabilizes following the
global recession and managers seek an advantage over other
investments, the newspaper said.
