             Dubai, the sheikhdom in the United
Arab Emirates, is developing a strategy to diversify power-
generation sources and improve efficiency to ensure an adequate
energy supply through 2030, the government said.  
 The emirate’s Supreme Energy Council held a two-day
workshop with advisers McKinsey & Co. to devise plans that would
include using “clean” coal, nuclear power and renewable-energy,
according to an e-mailed statement.  
 Dubai, the second-biggest of the seven sheikdoms in the
U.A.E., produces less than 4 percent of the nation’s oil. The
emirate is seeking to guarantee power supply and reduce
emissions that contribute to global warming, according to
comments made by  Saeed Mohammad Al-Tayer , the Council’s vice
chairman, in today’s statement.  
 The U.A.E. holds about 7 percent of the world’s crude
reserves, with most of the country’s deposits of oil and natural
gas located in Abu Dhabi, its national capital and largest
emirate. Oil and natural gas production made up about 5.5
percent of Dubai’s $62 billion economy in 2007, according to
data from the U.A.E. Economy Ministry.  
 Persian Gulf states are boosting power supply to meet
rising demand from growing populations and as they seek
investment to spur economic growth. The U.A.E. is beginning an
atomic-energy program to diversify supply and compensate for
limited amounts of the natural gas needed to fire power plants.  
 Reorganizing Energy Sources  
 Dubai’s ruler,  Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , last
year established an energy planning council and an oil affairs
department to manage production, sale and export of crude and
regulate licensing of related products.  Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktoum  was named as chairman of the Department of Oil
Affairs and will head the Supreme Council for Energy.  
 The emirate earlier this year said it discovered an
offshore crude deposit that it plans to evaluate and begin
developing as early as next year. The size of the deposit and
prospective production levels weren’t disclosed.  
 Government-run utility Dubai Electricity & Water Authority
is seeking international investors to build a 1,500-megawatt
power plant and water desalination facility. DEWA, headed by Al-
Tayer, plans to build in six phases a new generation facility
located at Hassyan on the border with Abu Dhabi that would
generate a total of 9,000 megawatts when completed.  
 The utility, which slowed projects because of lower growth
rates, still plans to raise generation capacity by about a third
over the next two years to 9,800 megawatts, Al-Tayer said in
March. The company is also building a 2,085-megawatts combined-
cycle gas turbine plant at an industrial area along the coast.
