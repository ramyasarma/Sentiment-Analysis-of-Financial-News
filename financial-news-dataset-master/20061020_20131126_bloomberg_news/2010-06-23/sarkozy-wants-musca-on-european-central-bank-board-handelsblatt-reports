             France’s President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
wants  Xavier Musca , his chief economic adviser, to join the
European Central Bank’s board when  Jean-Claude Trichet  steps
down from the post of president next year,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing no one.  
 France will back Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  as the
successor to Trichet only if the German government supports
Musca’s joining the board in return, the newspaper said.
