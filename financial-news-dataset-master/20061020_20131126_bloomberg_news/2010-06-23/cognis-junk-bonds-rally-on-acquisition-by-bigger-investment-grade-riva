             Debt of Cognis Holding GmbH, the
German food- and cosmetics-ingredients maker, rose after
chemicals firm BASF SE agreed to buy the company for 3.1 billion
euros ($3.8 billion).  
 Cognis’s term loans due 2013 were quoted at face value,
compared with 99 percent of face value at the start of the week,
according to Mizuho Financial Group Inc. The company’s 9.5
percent bonds due 2014 rose to 105.5 from 104.25, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices on Bloomberg.  
 BASF  said  it plans to refinance Cognis’s debt after the
acquisition is closed. Cognis, with 2.3 billion euros of bonds
and loans ranked six steps below investment-grade according to
Bloomberg data, will move out of the junk category.  
 BASF’s all-cash deal with Cognis owners Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Permira Advisers Ltd., and SV Life Sciences is based on
700 million euros in equity, additional debt and 503 million
euros in pension liabilities, Chief Executive Officer Juergen
Hambrecht of Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF said.  
 BASF is rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service, the fifth
highest assessment, and an equivalent A+ by Standard & Poor’s
and Fitch Ratings. Cognis is ranked B3 by Moody’s and an
equivalent B- from S&P, six steps below investment-grade.  
 Moody’s said today it may raise its ratings on Cognis. It
may cut BASF, citing the company’s added debt burden to finance
the acquisition. BASF borrowed 3 billion euros to pay for the
takeover. A downgrade to BASF “would be limited to one notch,”
the ratings firm said.
