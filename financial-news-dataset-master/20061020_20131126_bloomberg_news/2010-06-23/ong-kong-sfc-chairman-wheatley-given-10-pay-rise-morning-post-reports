             Martin Wheatley, chairman of the
Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, got a 10 percent
pay increase for the last financial year, the South China
Morning Post reported, citing the commission’s annual report.  
 The increase for the 12 months ended March made Wheatley
the third-highest paid regulator in the city last year, behind
Paul Chow, former chief executive officer of Hong Kong Exchanges
and Clearing, and Joseph Yam, former Hong Kong Monetary
Authority chief executive, who each received more than HK$10
million, according to the report. Wheatley’s basic salary is
HK$7.5 million, the Morning Post said.
