             The Philippine government plans to
increase spending and raise more revenue this year, Budget
Undersecretary  Laura Pascua  said, as the nation seeks to sustain
its recovery from last year’s global slump.  
 The government raised its 2010 spending budget for public
works, salaries and debt payments to a record 1.62 trillion
pesos ($35 billion) from a previous forecast of 1.58 trillion
pesos, Pascua said. Revenue, including gains from the sale and
lease of assets, may climb to 1.32 trillion pesos compared with
an earlier estimate of 1.28 trillion pesos, she said.  
 President-elect  Benigno Aquino , who takes over from  Gloria Arroyo  this month, has pledged to cut poverty in a nation where
the World Bank estimates one in every four people live on less
than $1.25 a day. Still, a  budget deficit  that is forecast to
hold near a record this year may limit the government’s ability
to spend to bolster growth.  
 “Our priorities are still education, health, agriculture
and public outlays,” Budget Secretary  Joaquin Lagonera  said in
a telephone interview in Manila today.  
 The government expects the budget shortfall to be little
changed at 297.2 billion pesos this year from a record 298.5
billion pesos in 2009. The five-month deficit widened to 162.1
billion pesos, exceeding the first-half target.  
 Economic expansion  in the Southeast Asian nation may
accelerate to a range of 5 percent to 6 percent this year from
1.1 percent in 2009, officials predicted earlier this month. The
$167 billion economy expanded 7.3 percent last quarter, the
fastest pace in almost three years.
