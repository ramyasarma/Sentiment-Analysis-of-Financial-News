             UniCredit SpA  asked Compagnia
Italpetroli SpA, which controls Italian soccer club  AS Roma , to
appoint an adviser for the sale of assets to help pay back debt
of 325 million euros ($397 million),  Il Messaggero  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 The adviser would be authorized to sell any asset owned by
the Sensi family, owners of Italpetroli, including the soccer
club, the Rome-based newspaper said. Representatives from the
family and UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank, will meet today in
Rome to discuss the plan, Messaggero said.
