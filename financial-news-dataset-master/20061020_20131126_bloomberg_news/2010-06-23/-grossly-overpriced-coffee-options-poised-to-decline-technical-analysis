             Coffee traders should sell
“grossly overpriced” options on New York futures to take
advantage of a recent rally, said  James Cordier , a portfolio
manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa, Florida.  
 Options giving the right to buy September coffee futures
at $2 a pound have jumped as much as fivefold to 4.86 cents
since reaching an all-time low of 0.83 cent on June 8. During
the same period, the September $2.10 calls rose as high as 4
cents from 0.66 cent. The two contracts are the most held among
September call options. Coffee futures for September delivery
slipped 0.05 cent to $1.6075 on ICE Futures U.S. in New York
yesterday.  
 The spread between the 30-day implied and historical
volatility, a measure of the divergence between expected and
past price swings, was at the highest level since June 2009,
indicating traders see greater volatility in the near future,
options trading monitored by Bloomberg show.  
 Coffee futures would have to surge at least 24 percent for
those “grossly overpriced” options to be profitable before
they expire on Aug. 13, said Cordier, who manages about $100
million in assets, including coffee options. That is not likely
to happen, with the bulk of Brazilian supplies becoming
available in a few months, he said. Brazil is the world’s
largest producer.  
 Coffee may tumble to its “fair value” of $1.45 and $1.50
“in a week or so,” Cordier said. “We would be selling these
very expensive options right now.”
