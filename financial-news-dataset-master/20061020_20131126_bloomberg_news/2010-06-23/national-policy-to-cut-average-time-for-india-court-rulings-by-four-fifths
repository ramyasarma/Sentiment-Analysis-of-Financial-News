             India plans to cut the average time
taken by the nation’s courts to hear cases by 80 percent by
reducing the number of lawsuits filed by government agencies.  
 The government plans to trim the time taken for courts to
hear cases to three years from 15 years, the Press Information
Bureau said in a  statement  yesterday. It will create a new
department that will review government cases before moving court
and increase pay for lawyers involved in its cases, according to
the statement.  
 Expediting legal cases may help rebuild investor confidence
after India slipped to 41st place, behind Mongolia, among the
183 nations ranked for protecting investors in the World Bank’s
2010 “ Doing Business Report .” There were 30.8 million cases
pending in Indian courts on March 2009, according to the website
of the Supreme Court of India. Government agencies accounted for
about 70 percent of the cases, the Times of India newspaper
reported yesterday.  
 The government “must cease to be a compulsive litigant,”
Minister for Law and Justice  Veerappa Moily  said in the
statement. “While Government cannot pay fees which private
litigants are in a position to pay, the fees payable to
government lawyers will be suitably revised to make it
remunerative.”  
 The National Litigation Policy, unveiled yesterday by the
government, also aims to restrict the grounds for appeals and
adjournments, as well as increase the government’s use of
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as arbitration.
