             Canadian  retail sales  in April fell
more than forecast, reversing most of the previous month’s gain,
on declines in new car and clothing receipts.  
 Sales fell 2 percent to C$36.2 billion ($35 billion), the
biggest decline since December 2008, Statistics Canada said
today in Ottawa. The drop exceeded the most pessimistic estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of 17 economists, with the median forecast
for a 0.4 percent fall.  
 Bank of Canada Deputy Governor  Timothy Lane  said yesterday
economic growth should moderate this quarter after the economy
expanded faster than expected. Consumer spending helped lead
 growth  of 6.1 percent at an annualized pace in the January-March
period, and the central bank raised its  key interest rate  to 0.5
percent on June 1 from a record low 0.25 percent to head off
inflation pressures.  
 “There is a yellow flag here,” said  Sebastien Lavoie , an
economist at Laurentian Bank Securities in Montreal. “The
economy is going through a phase of transition; growth is
decelerating.”  
 The growth rate will probably slow to 2.5 percent this
quarter, and the central bank will stick to quarter-point rate
increases at its remaining meetings this year, Lavoie said.  
 The Canadian currency weakened 1.1 percent to C$1.0413 per
U.S. dollar at 9:30 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0296
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 96.03 U.S. cents.  
 Cars Lead Decline  
 The retail sales decline was led by new car dealerships,
where receipts fell 5.3 percent to C$6.1 billion.  
 Excluding car and parts dealers, retail  sales  fell 1.2
percent to C$28.5 billion. On that basis, economists predicted
sales would be unchanged, according to the median of 17
estimates.  
 Sales excluding the automotive sector, which removes
gasoline station sales as well as car and parts dealers, fell 1
percent to C$24.5 billion.  
 Clothing and accessories receipts dropped 5.2 percent to
C$2.02 billion in April, after warm weather in March boosted
sales, Statistics Canada said.  
 The agency also changed its March sales estimate to a 2.2
percent increase from the initial reading of 2.1 percent. Sales
rose 6.6 percent in the 12 months ending in April.
