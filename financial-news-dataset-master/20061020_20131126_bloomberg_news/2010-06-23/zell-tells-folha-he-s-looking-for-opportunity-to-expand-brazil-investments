             Billionaire  Sam Zell  is in Brazil
today and tomorrow seeking opportunities to expand the
investments of his Equity International in the South American
country, Folha de S. Paulo reported citing Zell.  
 Zell told Folha he considers Brazil one of the most
attractive opportunities in the world as President Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva focused on growth while keeping up with fiscal
discipline to avoid hyperinflation, Zell said, according to the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper.
