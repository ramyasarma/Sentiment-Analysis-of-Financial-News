             France’s CAC 40 Index declined for a
third day, losing 86.43, or 2.4 percent, to 3,555.36. The
broader SBF120 Index dropped 2.3 percent to 2,634.28.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
French equity market today.  
 BNP Paribas  (BNP FP) declined 5 percent to 45.88 euros and
 Societe Generale SA  (GLE FP) lost 4.5 percent to 35.16 euros.
Banks led declines across western European equity markets as
concern increased that the region’s debt crisis may derail the
economic recovery. Credit-default swaps on Greek government debt
rose 27 basis points to a record 959, according to CMA
DataVision.  
 Compagnie des Alpes SA (CDA FP) sank 4.5 percent to 22.98
euros, dropping for a fourth day in five. The company said that
it secured 550 million euros in bank financing and that it will
seek about 100 million euros in a capital increase.  
 LDLC.com  (LDL FP) climbed 2.2 percent to 3.21 euros after
the online computer hardware and software retailer said it has a
positive outlook for this year.  
 Theolia SA  (TEO FP) slumped 5.1 percent to 2.23 euros,
after saying it will seek to raise 60.5 million euros through a
rights offer.  
 Total SA  (FP FP) sank 2.1 percent to 38.44 euros. Crude oil
fell to near its lowest in a week as growing U.S. inventories
reinforced doubts about the economic recovery and a stronger
dollar reduced oil’s investment appeal.
