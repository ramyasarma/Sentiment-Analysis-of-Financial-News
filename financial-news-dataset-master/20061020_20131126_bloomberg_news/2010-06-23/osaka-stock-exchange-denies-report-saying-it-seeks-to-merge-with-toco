             Osaka Securities Exchange Co. ,
Japan’s second-largest stock exchange, denied a report that it
is seeking merger with  Tokyo Commodity Exchange  Inc. after the
government announced it wanted to create a unified exchange.  
 “We are not negotiating with a concrete party for specific
issues,” said exchange spokesman  Masahiro Yada . Osaka exchange
executives are in talks with officials from the Financial
Services Agency and the Ministry of Trade, Economy and Industry,
the Sankei newspaper reported earlier today, without saying
where it obtained the information.  
 The report came days after the Japanese government’s
medium-term economic plan on June 18 showed the country will
create a comprehensive exchange that trades bonds, stocks,
financial futures and commodities by the 2013 fiscal year.  
 OSE shares fell 1.9 percent to 435,500 yen at the 11 a.m.
break in Osaka trading.  
 Tocom also denied the Sankei report. “It’s not true,”
said exchange spokesman Seiki Ichimura. “There’s no approach
from the Osaka stock exchange on the merger issue.”
