             Panasonic Corp. Aims to boost sales
of household fuels cells to as many as 100,000 units in 2015
from 3,000 to 5,000 estimated for 2010, the company said
in a statement today.  
 Fuel cells generally use hydrogen and oxygen to generate
electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Panasonic
started selling household fuel cells in May 2009, a product
that has a power output of 1000 watts, according to the
company’s website.
