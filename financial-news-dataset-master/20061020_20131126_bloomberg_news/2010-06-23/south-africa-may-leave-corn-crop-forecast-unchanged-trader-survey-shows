             South Africa, the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably leave its forecast for
this season’s crop unchanged, a Bloomberg survey showed.  
 The government may say farmers will reap 13.32 million
metric tons in the season that started May 1, the same as
estimated last month, according to the median estimate of 10
traders surveyed by Bloomberg. Forecasts ranged from 13.32
million tons to 13.7 million tons.  
 The government’s Crop Estimates Committee is scheduled to
release its assessment of the harvest at 2:30 p.m. local time
tomorrow.  
 White corn for July delivery fell 14.80 rand, or 1.4
percent, to end trade at 1,036.20 rand ($137) a ton on the  South
African Futures Exchange . Meal made from the grain is the
country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for July delivery dropped 12 rand, or 1.1
percent, to 1,091 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are the world’s
biggest corn exporters.
