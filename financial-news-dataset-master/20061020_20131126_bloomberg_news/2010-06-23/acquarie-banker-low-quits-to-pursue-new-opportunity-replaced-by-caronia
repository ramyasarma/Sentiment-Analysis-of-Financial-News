             Macquarie Group Ltd. ’s  Andrew Low ,
chief operating officer of the Australian company’s investment
banking division, quit to pursue a new business opportunity,
according to a note sent to employees.  
 Len Caronia , head of Macquarie’s North American financial
institutions group, will succeed Low as global head of that
division, the memo said. Low will remain a consultant to
Macquarie Capital, according to the note, a copy of which was
obtained by Bloomberg News.  
 The departure follows that of  Jim Rossman , the U.S. equity
capital markets chief who quit last week, and  David Baron ,
Macquarie’s head of U.S. financial sponsors coverage. The
Sydney-based bank, which expanded its advisory business last
year buying Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller LLC, said in
April that turnover among directors had climbed.  
 Low ran Macquarie Capital in Asia for six years until 2009
and was seen as the deputy to global investment banking chief
 Michael Carapiet , according to the Australian newspaper, which
reported Low’s departure earlier today. He left to start an
Asia-Pacific financial-services company, the newspaper said.  
 Fiona Tyndall , a spokeswoman for Macquarie, declined to
comment. Macquarie today  fell  3.1 percent to A$42.67 in Sydney
trading. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 1.6 percent.
