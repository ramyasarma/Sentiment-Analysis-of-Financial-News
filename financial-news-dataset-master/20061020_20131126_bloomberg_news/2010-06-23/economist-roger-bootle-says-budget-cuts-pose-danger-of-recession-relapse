             Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
government runs the risk of pushing the economy into another
recession in the biggest budget squeeze for 50 years, former
U.K. Treasury adviser  Roger Bootle  said.  
 “The gamble of this budget is, what’s going to happen if
the economy does not deliver and it’s generally thought that
this budget has pushed the economy over the edge?” Bootle, the
founder of London-based research company Capital Economics Ltd.,
said on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” today. “Slower
growth people will just about accept. The real danger is that we
go back into recession.”  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  yesterday raised
sales tax, froze public workers’ pay, and said government
agencies apart from the National Health Service face a 25
percent spending cut over four years to tame the deficit. U.K.
 economic growth  slowed to 0.3 percent in the first quarter from
0.4 percent in the final three months of 2009.  
 Bootle said the U.K. runs the risk of another slump as
public-spending cuts in other countries threaten to curb demand
for British goods abroad. The Bank of England is counting on the
pound’s weakness to stoke exports and support the recovery.  
 Countries are “competing to say ‘My austerity package is
bigger than yours,’” Bootle said. “The result of all this is
that every country’s export market is being squeezed.”
