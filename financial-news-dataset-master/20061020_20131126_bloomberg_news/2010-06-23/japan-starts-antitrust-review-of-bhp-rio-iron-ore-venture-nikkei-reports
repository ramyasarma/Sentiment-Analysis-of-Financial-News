             The Japan Fair Trade Commission has
begun a review of a plan by BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto
Group to merge Australian iron ore mining operations, Nikkei
English News said, citing the commission’s Secretary-General
Takahide Matsuyama.  
 The commission will decide by July 16 whether to approve
the plan or conduct a further review, the report said. The two
companies supply about 60 percent of Japan’s iron ore, the
Nikkei said.
