             Nycomed A/S, a Swiss drugmaker owned
by private-equity firms, got approval from lenders to ease
conditions on about 4.8 billion euros ($5.9 billion) of loans,
two people familiar with the situation said.  
 Lenders agreed to change the terms after the company
offered to pay a 75 basis-point consent fee and increase the
interest margin it will pay for the loans by 150 basis points,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
information is private. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Nycomed, whose owners include Nordic Capital and a buyout
unit of Credit Suisse Group AG, renegotiated its loans in order
to issue subordinated debt and sell shares in an initial public
offering, the people said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised the
company, the people said.  
 The company began soliciting consent to amend the loans
earlier this month. It improved its offer June 16.
