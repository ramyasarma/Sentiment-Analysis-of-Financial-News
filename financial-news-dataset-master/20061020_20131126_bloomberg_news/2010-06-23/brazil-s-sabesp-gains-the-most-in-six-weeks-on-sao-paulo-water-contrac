             Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo , Brazil’s biggest water utility, jumped the most in
seven weeks after saying its board authorized the signing of a
30-year contract to provide sanitation and water-supply services
to Sao Paulo.  
 Shares gained 4.1 percent, the most since May 3, to 36.05
reais in Sao Paulo trading.  
 The new contract is positive because it better compensates
the utility known as Sabesp for its investments, and ensures its
relationship with South America’s largest city, said  Erick Hood ,
an analyst at Sao Paulo-based SLW Corretora de Valores.  
 “This is very important for the company,” Hood said.
“The city is its biggest client.”
