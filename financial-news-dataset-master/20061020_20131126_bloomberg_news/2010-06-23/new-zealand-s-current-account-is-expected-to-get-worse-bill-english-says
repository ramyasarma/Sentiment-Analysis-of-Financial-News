             New Zealand’s current account
deficit, which was the narrowest in more than 21 years in the 12
months ended March 31, is likely to get “significantly” worse
in coming years, Finance Minister Bill English said in response
to questions in parliament today. The nation needs to increase
exports and save more to reduce foreign borrowing, he said.
