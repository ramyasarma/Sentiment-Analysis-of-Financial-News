             Crude oil pared earlier losses to
trade above $76 a barrel in New York as the dollar weakened for
a second day against the euro, increasing the investment appeal
of commodities.  
 Futures dropped 1.9 percent yesterday as the U.S. Energy
Information Administration reported crude  stockpiles  rose more
than analysts expected. Sales of new homes declined in May to a
record low as a tax credit expired.  
 “It’s difficult to go higher than $80 a barrel,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity derivative sales manager at Newedge Group
in Tokyo. “Now is the time for a correction. Still, the price
will be driven by how the U.S. dollar fares.”  
 Crude for August delivery was at $76.32 a barrel, down 3
cents, at 2:54 p.m. Singapore time in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. It earlier dropped as much as 42
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $75.93 a barrel. Yesterday, the
contract fell $1.50 to $76.35.  
 The dollar fell to $1.2333 versus the euro as of 6:51 a.m.
in London, from $1.2311 in New York yesterday. The U.S. currency
declined for a second day as traders increased bets the Federal
Reserve will keep interest rates near zero for longer to support
a recovery in the world’s largest economy.  
 Fed officials retained a pledge to keep the benchmark
interest rate at a record low and signaled that European
indebtedness may harm U.S. growth.  
 U.S. Supplies  
 U.S. crude stockpiles rose 2.02 million barrels to 365.1
million in the week ended June 18. Supplies were forecast to
drop 800,000 barrels, according to analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  
 Imports  of crude climbed 4.3 percent to 10.1 million
barrels a day, the highest level since the week ended Jan. 2,
2009, the Energy Department report showed. Fuel imports surged
10 percent to 2.32 million barrels a day.  
 Gasoline  supplies  fell 762,000 barrels to 217.6 million
last week. An 180,000-barrel drop was forecast, according to the
median of 15 responses in the survey.  
 Refineries operated at 89.4 percent of capacity, up 1.5
percentage points from the prior week and the highest level
since April, the report showed.  
 Brent crude oil for August delivery was at $76.35 a barrel,
up 8 cents, at 2:44 p.m. Singapore time on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Yesterday the contract slipped $1.77,
or 2.3 percent, to end the session at $76.27 a barrel.  
 Slower Demand Growth  
 The International Energy Agency, an adviser to oil-
consuming nations, said in a report yesterday that growth in
world oil demand will slow in the next five years as the pace of
Chinese consumption moderates.  
 The IEA estimates that the rate of annual demand growth
will shrink each year between now and 2015. Consumption will
climb 1 percent to 91.93 million barrels a day in 2015, down
from 1.5 percent growth in 2010, according to the Paris-based
agency’s Medium-Term Oil and Gas Markets 2010 report.  
 “Sentiment is still pretty weak,” said  Ben Westmore , a
minerals and energy economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in
Melbourne. “On the demand front, it’s still negative and still
very uncertain.”  
 Chinese oil demand is expected to reach 11.63 million
barrels a day by 2015, up from 9.16 million this year, according
to the IEA data. The pace is slowing, with consumption rising
4.1 percent in 2015, compared with 7.6 percent this year,
according to the report.  
 The rate of consumption decline in developed economies is
accelerating. Total demand from the 30 industrialized countries
that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development will drop 0.9 percent in 2015 compared with a 0.1
percent fall in 2010, the agency estimates.  
 Storm Conditions  
 Conditions are ripe for a tropical storm or even a
hurricane to develop in the Gulf of Mexico this weekend, a
potential threat to gas and oil interests there by the middle of
next week, forecasters said.  
 The storm may also affect BP Plc’s efforts to halt and
clean the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 A collection of thunderstorms, also known as a tropical
wave, is currently dropping rain on Cuba, Jamaica and Hispaniola
and is expected to organize into at least a tropical storm by
June 27, said  Jim Rouiller , a senior energy meteorologist at
Planalytics Inc. in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. If the storm forms, it
will be named Alex.  
 “On the other hand, with the prospect of an economic
rebound and the approach of hurricane season in mind, the lower
side of crude also has support at $75 a barrel,” said Newedge’s
Hasegawa.  
 Sales of new homes slipped to an annual pace of 300,000
last month from April, less than the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the fewest in data
going back to 1963, figures from the Commerce Department showed
yesterday in Washington.  
 “There are still many weak sectors in the U.S. economy,”
said  Mike Sander , an investment adviser at Sander Capital
Advisors in Seattle. “Prices should remain depressed. There
could be a bit more room to go to the downside.”
