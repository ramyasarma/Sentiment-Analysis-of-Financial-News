             Mortgage applications in the U.S.
dropped from a six-month high as purchases fell and gains in
refinancing subsided.  
 The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  decreased 5.9
percent in the week ended June 18. The Washington-based group’s
 purchase  gauge declined 1.2 percent to the second-lowest level
since 1997, while its  refinancing  gauge slid 7.3 percent from
the highest reading since May 2009.  
 The housing market has cooled following an April 30
deadline for a tax credit worth as much as $8,000. The benefits
of borrowing costs close to the lowest recorded, which spurred
homeowners to refinance loans and trim monthly payments, are
outweighed by concerns about unemployment and mounting
 foreclosures .  
 “Amid sluggish job growth, ongoing high foreclosures and
the expired tax credit, housing is due for a sharp pullback,”
 Sal Guatieri , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in
Toronto, said before the report. “While record-low mortgage
rates should provide some ballast, the market will remain
fragile until employment strengthens and foreclosures abate.”  
 The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan fell to
73.8 percent last week from 74.8 percent the prior week.  
 The average rate on a  30-year fixed  loan decreased to 4.75
percent from 4.82 percent the prior week. Rates reached a record
low of 4.61 percent in March 2009 after the Federal Reserve
expanded a mortgage-purchasing plan aimed at reducing lending
rates. The program ended in March of this year.  
 Mortgage Rates  
 At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for each
$100,000 of a loan would be about $522, down $42 from a year ago
when the rate was 5.44 percent.  
 The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage dropped to
4.19 percent from 4.23 percent, and the rate on a one-year
adjustable mortgage fell to 7.05 percent, from 7.07 percent.  
 The tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which was
extended in November to include some current owners, required
contracts be signed by April 30 and settled by June 30.  
 A report yesterday signaled demand is weakening more than
anticipated.  Purchases  of existing houses, which are tabulated
when a contract closes, unexpectedly decreased 2.2 percent in
May to a 5.66 million annual rate, figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed. A decline in home starts and
building permits last month also reinforced the retrenchment.  
 Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. , the largest homebuilder in New
Jersey, said orders fell 17 percent in the quarter ended April
30 from a year earlier, and contract signings slowed in May,
indicating the tax credit helped pull some sales forward.  
 Fed policy makers, completing their two-day meeting today,
are forecast to commit to keeping interest rates near zero to
help wean the world’s largest economy off government stimulus.
The risk of renewed weakness in the industry that precipitated
the worst recession since the 1930s, and low inflation, are
among reasons central bankers will keep policy unchanged.
