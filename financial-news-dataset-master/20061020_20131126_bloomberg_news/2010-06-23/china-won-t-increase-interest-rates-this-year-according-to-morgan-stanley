             China won’t raise interest rates
this year as the government is “comfortable” with the outlook
for the domestic economy, according to Morgan Stanley.  
 The change in China’s currency policy signals the
government’s acceptance of the need to rebalance its economy
towards domestic consumption, analysts Gerald Minack and Jason
Todd wrote in a note to clients. Morgan Stanley expects the
dollar to weaken by around 10 percent against the yuan by the
end of next year.
