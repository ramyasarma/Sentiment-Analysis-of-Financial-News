             Crude oil fell for a second day
after U.S. government reports showed an unexpected gain in
supplies and a decline in purchases of new homes.  
 Stockpiles  rose 2.02 million barrels to 365.1 million in
the week ended June 18, the Energy Department said today in a
weekly report. Supplies were forecast to drop 800,000 barrels,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Sales of new
homes declined in May to a record low as a tax credit expired.  
 “The inventory numbers were certainly very bearish,” said
 Sean Brodrick , a natural resource analyst with Weiss Research in
Jupiter, Florida. “The sale of new homes collapsed by 33
percent, the most in the history of the data. This is bearish
for both the economy and for demand for oil.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery fell $1.50, or 1.9 percent,
to settle at $76.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It was the biggest drop for a front-month contract
since June 11.  
 Brent crude oil for August delivery slipped $1.77, or 2.3
percent, to end the session at $76.27 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 The increase in inventories left crude oil stockpiles at
the highest level for the period since 1990, department figures
showed. It was the 18th gain in 21 weeks.  
 Sales of new homes slipped to an annual pace of 300,000
last month from April, less than the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the fewest in data
going back to 1963, figures from the Commerce Department showed
today in Washington.  
 Interest Rates  
 Federal Reserve officials retained a pledge to keep the
benchmark interest rate at a  record low  for an “extended
period” and signaled that European indebtedness may harm U.S.
growth. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is trying to cut
unemployment that’s close to a 26-year-high and maintain the
recovery as new-home sales slide and growth in private payrolls
weakens.  
 Gasoline  supplies  fell 762,000 barrels to 217.6 million
last week, the report showed. An 180,000-barrel drop was
forecast, according to the median of 15 responses in the
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 297,000 barrels to 156.9
million, the highest level since the week ended Jan. 22, the
report showed. A 1.5 million-barrel gain was projected.  
 Gasoline demand  declined  1 percent to 9.24 million barrels
a day last week from the previous seven-day period, the report
showed. Consumption of the motor fuel was up 1.2 percent from
the same week last year.  
 ‘Horrible’ Demand  
 “Gasoline demand was horrible,” said  Michael Lynch ,
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
Massachusetts. “We’re barely up from this time last year when
demand was feeling the full impact of the recession.”  
 Gasoline tumbled 5.12 cents, or 2.4 percent, to settle at
$2.0823 a gallon in New York. It was the biggest decline since
June 4.  
 Imports  of crude oil climbed 4.3 percent to 10.1 million
barrels a day, the highest level since the week ended Jan. 2,
2009, the report showed. Fuel imports surged 10 percent to 2.32
million barrels a day.  
 Refineries operated at 89.4 percent of capacity, up 1.5
percentage points from the prior week and the highest level
since April, the report showed.  
 The International Energy Agency, an adviser to oil-
consuming nations, said in a report today that growth in world
oil demand will slow in the next five years as the pace of
Chinese consumption moderates.  
 Slower Demand Growth  
 The IEA estimates that the rate of annual demand growth
will shrink each year between now and 2015. Consumption will
climb 1 percent to 91.93 million barrels a day in 2015, down
from 1.5 percent growth in 2010, according to the Paris-based
agency’s Medium-Term Oil and Gas Markets 2010 report.  
 “The IEA report came as a bit of a shock,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in Chicago. “A lot
of the bulls have been looking for demand growth to accelerate
and this report shows that the opposite will probably occur.”  
 Chinese oil demand is expected to reach 11.63 million
barrels a day by 2015, up from 9.16 million this year, according
to the IEA data. The pace is slowing, with consumption rising
4.1 percent in 2015, compared with 7.6 percent this year,
according to the report.  
 The rate of consumption decline in developed economies is
accelerating. Total demand from the 30 industrialized countries
that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development will drop 0.9 percent in 2015 compared with a 0.1
percent fall in 2010, the agency estimates.  
 Signs of Recovery  
 “Oil and gas markets are starting to show signs of
recovery, but the impact of the recession differs across regions
and the outlook remains very uncertain,”  Nobuo Tanaka ,
executive director of the IEA, said in Paris today. “The
projected growth in demand is not set in stone.”  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 545,679 contracts as of 3:12
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 472,492
contracts yesterday, 39 percent less than the average of the
past three months. Open interest was 1.26 million contracts.
