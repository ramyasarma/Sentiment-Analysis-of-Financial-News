             U.K. mortgage approvals  rose to the
highest in five months in May after the Bank of England
maintained emergency stimulus for the economy, the  British
Bankers’ Association  said.  
 Banks granted 36,709 loans, compared with 35,964 the
previous month, the London-based group said in an e-mailed
statement today. The number of approvals was up 7 percent from a
year earlier.  
 The housing market may face pressure from tax increases and
spending cuts pledged yesterday by Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  to tackle the record budget deficit. U.K. asking
prices rose for a sixth month in June, though gains may falter
as budget measures take effect, Rightmove Plc, Britain’s biggest
property website, said this week.  
 The BBA data “do little to dilute our suspicion that house
prices will struggle to make significant gains over the coming
months,”  Howard Archer , chief European economist at IHS Global
Insight in London, said in a research note. “A major fiscal
squeeze is starting; credit conditions remain tight.”  
 The bank held the key interest rate at a record low of 0.5
percent and its bond-purchase program at 200 billion pounds
($298 billion) this month. Policy maker  Andrew Sentance  made the
first push for an  interest-rate increase  in two years to counter
faster inflation, minutes of the decision published today show.  
 The average value of a loan for house purchase in May was
150,500 pounds, compared with 136,200 pounds a year earlier, the
BBA said.
