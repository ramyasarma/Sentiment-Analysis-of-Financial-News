             Nucor Corp. , the largest U.S.
steelmaker, said operating rates at its plants may “inch up”
this year as the economy struggles to create jobs.  
 Nucor’s plants are running at about 75 percent of capacity,
compared with 73 percent to 74 percent across the U.S. steel
industry, Chief Executive Officer  Dan DiMicco  said today in an
interview at the Steel Success Strategies conference in New
York. Any improvement depends on gains in the economy,
particularly  employment , he said.  
 “Operating rates may inch up over the course of the
year,” DiMicco said. “The economy is going to be struggling
along here for a little bit in the third quarter. Let me know
when we start adding jobs.”  
 The U.S. economy lost about 8.4 million jobs during the
recession that began in December 2007, the biggest employment
slump since World War II. Companies have added 495,000 jobs so
far this year.  
 DiMicco said the U.S. faces “a long road back” unless
government works with the private sector to reduce the 16.6
percent underemployment rate, which is the unemployment rate
plus part-time workers seeking full-time jobs and people who
want to work and have given up looking.  
 “The leaders in this country have not identified the
problem properly,” DiMicco said in a presentation. “The things
that need to be done aren’t being done.”  
 Nucor, based in Charlotte, North Carolina,  rose  64 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $41.72 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares declined 11 percent this
year.
