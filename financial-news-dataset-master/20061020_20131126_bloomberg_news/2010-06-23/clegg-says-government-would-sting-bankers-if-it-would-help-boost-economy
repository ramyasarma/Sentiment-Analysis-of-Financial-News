             Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
defended the size of a levy on banks, saying that if the U.K.
government could boost economic growth just by “stinging the
bankers,” it would do so.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  introduced a 2.5
billion-pound ($3.7 billion) levy on banks’ liabilities in his
emergency budget yesterday.  
 Liberal Democrat leader Clegg was tackled by a voter during
a televised question-and-answer session alongside Conservative
Prime Minister  David Cameron  screened by BBC News today. The
questioner said the Liberal Democrats campaigned before last
month’s elections on a ticket that “gave people the impression
that the rich would pay.” Now the party is in government, the
“rich aren’t paying,” the questioner said.  
 “If we thought that we could get all the money we need to
make sure this economy is fair and was growing and there are
jobs for everybody just by stinging the bankers, I’m sure we
would try and do it,” Clegg said.
