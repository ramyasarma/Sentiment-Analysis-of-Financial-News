             Magna International Inc. ’s plan to
end founder  Frank Stronach’s  control of the largest North
American auto-parts maker is “novel and without close
precedent,” the Ontario Securities Commission said.  
 James Angus, representing Canada’s main securities
regulator, said the Magna proposal will have an impact on how
dual-share structures are unwound.  
 The Toronto-based commission is holding hearings beginning
today to consider a halt to the share conversion. The
shareholder vote is scheduled for June 28.  
 Under the plan, the Stronach Trust would receive $863
million in cash and Class A shares for the Class B stock that
now gives the family about 66 percent of voting rights at the
Aurora, Ontario-based company.  
 Stronach, 77, has controlled Magna since the late 1970s and
said that he provided an “entrepreneurial framework” for the
company’s growth. Magna stock now trades at values below its
peers because investors avoid companies with “multiple share
structures,” Chief Financial Officer  Vincent Galifi  said.  
 About 54 percent of the shareholders who have voted on the
proposal are in favor, Magna lawyer Larry Lowenstein told the
hearing today.  
 Magna’s A shares rose C$1.46, or 2 percent, to C$72.18 at
10:17 a.m. trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock had
its biggest gain in six months when the company announced the
proposal on May 6.
