             East Hampton, New York, which counts
comedian  Jerry Seinfeld  and entrepreneur  Martha Stewart  as
residents, had its credit rating lowered by Moody’s Investors
Service because of drained reserves and projected borrowing.  
 Moody’s cut East Hampton’s rating one level to A1, its
fifth-highest investment grade, from Aa3, affecting $85 million
of outstanding debt. The downgrade may raise its borrowing costs
and comes as the community of about 22,000 plans to sell $14.5
million of securities. Moody’s said the town may issue as much
as $30 million in debt to cover accumulated budget deficits.  
 “The rating downgrade reflects depletion of the town’s
financial reserves following four consecutive operating
deficits” in 2004 through 2007, Moody’s said in a report.  
 East Hampton’s budget problems stem from “significant and
growing” spending for employee benefits, which weren’t offset
by property-tax and fee increases, Moody’s said. In 2008, the
town spent $2.5 million more on health insurance than planned
after public-employee unions blocked a restructuring of
benefits, Moody’s said.  
 The collapse of the U.S. real-estate market has also
reduced mortgage-tax receipts. East Hampton projects a combined
deficit of $20 million to $30 million at the end of 2009, even
as it raised property taxes 24 percent in 2009 and overhauled
employee benefits, Moody’s said.  
 The rating company also revised its outlook for the town to
stable from negative.
