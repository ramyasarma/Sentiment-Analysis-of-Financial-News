             Can saftig  Anna Netrebko  still fit
into Manon’s party clothes? The Russian star sings Jules
Massenet’s sexpot at Covent Garden on Friday evening.  
 Netrebko plays the title role in the 1884 work at the
 Royal Opera House . En route to the convent, Manon falls madly
in love with the noble Chevalier des Grieux (Vittorio Grigolo),
and is soon catapulted into a dizzying world of Parisian
debauchery and wealth.  
 The production, which runs through July 10, is staged by
Laurent Pelly, and has Music Director  Antonio Pappano  at the
baton. Information:  http://www.roh.org.uk  or +44-20-7240-1200.  
 Saturday  
 If you think chairs are for sitting, think again.  
 “New Decor,” at the Hayward Gallery, explodes the notion
of furniture as comfy and functional. Items you see here have
no purpose: They’re subversive art. The mischievous works by
Monica Bonvicini could be sex-club props -- a hammock made of
metal chains, a lounger woven with leather belts.  
 One floor up is Brazilian artist  Ernesto Neto’s 
experiential kingdom. Neto invites you to wander through a
tunnel of stretched tulle (weighed down with pouches of spice
or pebbles), walk up ladders for an aerial view, and take a dip
in the pool on the terrace.  
 “New Decor” and “Ernesto Neto: The Edges of the World”
-- both through Sept. 5 -- are at the  Hayward Gallery ,
Southbank Centre. Information:  http://www.haywardgallery.org.uk 
or call +44-20-7960-4200.  
 Saturday Night  
 The list of stars at the three-day Hard Rock Calling in
Hyde Park grows every year, with  Stevie Wonder  topping the bill
on Saturday night. Jamiroquai,  Corinne Bailey Rae  and James
Morrison are onstage earlier in the evening.  
 Those attending the whole event also will catch  Paul McCartney  and Crosby, Stills and Nash on Sunday, with  Pearl Jam 
on Friday. Hard Rock Calling will never be as cool as
Glastonbury, though it’s a lot easier for Londoners to get home
at the end of the shows.

 Sunday  
 Imagine a fair where you can buy a Picasso painting, a
1936 Bentley, fine wine and a rare gem -- all in one place.  
 “Masterpiece London” is a new multidisciplinary one-stop
shop for those who still have spending power. More than 100
booths offer art and antiques, classic cars, photographs,
design and jewelry.  
 The fair is at the former Chelsea Barracks on Chelsea
Bridge Road, London SW1 through June 29. Information:
 http://www.masterpiecefair.com  or call +44-20-7499-7470.  
 The Caprice restaurant group has a venue on the site.

More enticing is the nearby 101 Pimlico Road, a British 
bistro. Information:  http://www.101pimlicoroad.co.uk/  or call
+44-20-7730-0202.
