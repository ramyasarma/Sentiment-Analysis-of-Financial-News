             China may limit businesses that
process or assemble imported materials into products for export,
the 21st Century Business Herald reported on its website late
yesterday, citing an unidentified trade official.  
 The businesses, which currently aren’t required to pay
taxes on imported materials as they are being processed for
export, would need to begin doing so as a result of the new
rules, the Guangzhou-based newspaper reported. The rules would
be applied to some products including the six for which the
government removed export tax rebates this week, according to
the report.  
 The new rules will be introduced soon, the newspaper
reported. China’s State Council may introduce guidelines for
accelerating the transformation of the nation’s export industry
in late July, according to the report.
