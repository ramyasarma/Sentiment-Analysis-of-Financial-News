             Netflix Inc., which says it’s the
largest-growing first-class U.S. Postal Service customer, gave
its support to ending Saturday mail delivery.  
 The approval of Netflix, which has more than 14 million
subscribers, follows that of  Time Warner Inc. , publisher of more
than 20 U.S. magazines including Sports Illustrated and People.
The Postal Service, which says eliminating Saturday delivery
would save $3 billion a year, wants to reduce the service to
five days a week. The proposal is among a suite of possible
changes to plug its deficit.  
 “A well-functioning Postal Service, positioned over the
long haul to meet changing customer and consumer demand, is more
important than maintaining current delivery frequency,”  Andrew Rendich , Netflix chief service and DVD operations officer, said
in testimony today before a joint U.S. House-Senate hearing
about postal customers and workers.  
 Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, called on the
Postal Service to make other changes, such as expanding its
range of products, to restore profitability.
