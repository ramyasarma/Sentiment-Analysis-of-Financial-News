             Real Estate Opportunities Plc said
it plans to demerge Battersea Power Station into a separate
listed vehicle, to coincide with the introduction of a new
investor in the project.  
 The company also said in a statement today that its
financial performance was affected by “unprecedented” market
conditions in the U.K. and Ireland.
