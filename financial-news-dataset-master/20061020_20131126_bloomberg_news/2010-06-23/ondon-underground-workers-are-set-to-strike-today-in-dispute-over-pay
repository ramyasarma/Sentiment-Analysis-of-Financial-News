             London Underground maintenance
workers can go on strike today after a U.K. judge refused to
block the walkout.  
 Judge Michael Tugendhat declined to grant an injunction
sought by Tube Lines Ltd. to halt the strike, which is scheduled
to start today at 7 p.m. in London. Tugendhat didn’t give his
reasoning for the decision.  
 About 1,000 workers are scheduled to stage two 48-hour
stoppages today and again on July 14. The Piccadilly, Northern
and Jubilee Lines will be the worst-affected.  
 Charles Bear, the lawyer for Tube Lines Ltd., argued that
the  National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers 
supplied the company incorrect data on the number of workers in
various positions that would participate in the strike.  
 The union ‘is trying to bring the London Underground system
to a halt as much as possible,” Bear said. “There is an
obvious discrepancy” in the data.  
 A new pay offer from  Tube Lines , which maintains and
upgrades three London routes, will be considered by union
representatives today, the RMT said before the ruling.  
 London Underground said in a statement on its website
before the court ruling that it planned to “operate a full
service to customers across the whole network, including on the
Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines,” throughout the strike.  
 “Safety is London Underground’s top priority and we would
never run trains if it was not safe to do so,” a spokesperson,
who wasn’t identified, said on the site.
