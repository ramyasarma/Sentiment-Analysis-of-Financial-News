             Fields in four of Mozambique’s
states were flooded as water volumes released from the Cahora
Bassa hydroelectric dam doubled, Noticias reported today, citing
Luis Pacheco, head of disaster management in Sofala province.  
 Discharge increased to 5,000 cubic meters per second
following rain in neighboring countries upstream, the Maputo-
based newspaper reported. Some of the districts in the central
province of the southern African country were on maximum alert
and committees from the disaster management institute had been
reactivated, according to Noticias.
