             Maquina de Vendas SA, Brazil’s
second-biggest retailer created by a merger this year, agreed to
buy electrical-appliances chain  City Lar , increasing the number
of its stores to 750.  
 Maquina de Vendas will operate under City Lar’s brand in
the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, and
in the Northern region, according to an e-mailed statement
today. The company, which didn’t disclose the financial terms of
the deal, said it won’t make cuts in City Lar’s workforce.  
 “We will preserve the essence of the business, which is
the brand, the team and the knowledge of the region,” Maquina
de Vendas Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Nunes said in the
statement.  
 The combined business will have annual sales of 6.1 billion
reais ($3.4 billion), bringing Maquina de Vendas closer to its
goal of reaching 1,000 stores and 10 billion reais annual sales
by 2014. The closely held company was created in March through
the merger of  Insinuante  and  Ricardo Eletro .  
 City Lar, based in Cuiaba, Brazil, was founded in 1979 by
Sidney Gasques, whose first business was travelling from city to
city in a Volkswagen microbus to sell stickers. The company now
has 200 stores in 81 cities and 5,200 employees.  
 Pao de Acucar  became Brazil’s biggest retailer last year
after acquiring Casas Bahia and Globex Utilidades SA. The Sao
Paulo-based retailer has combined sales of 40 billion reais
annually and more than 1,700 stores.
