             Mozambique approved four accords
that will align its tax processes for passenger and goods
transport with those of Tanzania and Zambia, cabinet
spokesperson Alberto Nkutumula said.  
 The system will improve free movement of people and goods
between the southern African nations, he told reporters in the
capital, Maputo, yesterday.
