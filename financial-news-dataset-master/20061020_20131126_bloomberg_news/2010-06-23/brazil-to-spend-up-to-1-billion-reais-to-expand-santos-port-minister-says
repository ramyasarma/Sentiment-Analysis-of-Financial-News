             Brazil plans to spend as much as 1
billion reais ($566 million) to double capacity at Santos Port,
Latin America’s biggest, Ports Minister  Pedro Brito  said.  
 The investment would allow the port to handle 6 million
containers per year by 2015 compared with 3 million now, Brito
said yesterday in an interview in Brasilia. The government will
auction the rights for the expansion early next year, he said.  
 Brazil is encouraging companies, such as  Cosan SA Industria
& Comercio  and  MRS Logistica , to invest as much as $18 billion
in the country’s 21 ports in the next five years to fight
deteriorating infrastructure that makes exporters less
competitive, Brito said. The investment would help Brazil
increase the use of goods transported by water to 29 percent of
the total in 15 years from a current 13 percent, he said.  
 The expansion includes building a platform on the outskirts
of the port to store goods from trains and trucks and reduce
traffic jams, Brito said. The goods would later be carried to
the port by small boats, he said.  
 “Access to the Port of Santos is its biggest problem today
and it needs heavy investment,” Brito said. “Luckily, there
are plenty of companies interested in bidding for the
expansion.”
