Michael Jackson ’s estate was sued for
$1.2 million by a Bahrain financial adviser that claims it
helped the singer obtain $320 million in loans in 2005.  AQ Consulting WLL was hired by Jackson to help refinance
$300 million Jackson owed to  Fortress Investment Group LLC , AQ
claimed yesterday in a complaint in federal court in New York.  AQ said it secured a commitment from  Citigroup Inc.  to
refinance the debt. Fortress, which had a right of last offer
with Jackson, then agreed to refinance the loans itself. AQ got
Jackson an additional $20 million in loans, it claimed.  According to AQ, Jackson agreed to pay the firm 1 percent
of the total refinancing, or $3.2 million. He paid $2 million at
the time of closing and agreed to pay the rest from future
earnings, the financial adviser said.  Jackson died in 2009 at 50, leaving about $500 million in
debt. Since his death, the estate, the owner of interests in
songs by the Beatles and other artists, has generated more than
$250 million.  John Branca , one of the executors of Jackson’s estate,
didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment
on the suit.  The case is AQ Consulting WLL v. Branca, 1:10-cv-7496, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
