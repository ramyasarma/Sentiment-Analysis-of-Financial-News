             The euro may depreciate to 78.87
British pence should the single currency remain below a so-
called resistance level at 84 pence, Commerzbank AG said, citing
technical indicators.  
 “The euro has peaked at 84 pence, the 2009 low, and looks
to be back under pressure,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income,
commodity and currency technical analysis at Commerzbank in
London, wrote in a research report today.  
 Jones said her short-term target was the support area at
81.95 pence to 81.70 pence, formed by the October 2008 peak and
the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the 2007-2008 uptrend
respectively. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that
prices rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high
or low.  
 “The medium-term outlook, over the next three months, is
negative,” Jones said in a telephone interview. “A break below
81.70 pence will see the next target of 78.87 pence, the 200-day
moving average, engaged.”  
 The euro weakened 1 percent to 82.05 pence as of 4:10 p.m.
in London, after reaching 82.03 pence earlier, the lowest level
since November, 2008.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  
 A resistance level on a chart is where technical analysts
expect orders to sell a currency and its related instruments.
The stronger the resistance, the more buying is needed to
advance through that level. Support is where analysts anticipate
buy orders. The stronger the support, the more selling is needed
to drop below that level.
