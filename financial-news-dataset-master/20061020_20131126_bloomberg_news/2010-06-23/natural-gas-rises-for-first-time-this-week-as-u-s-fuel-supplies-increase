             Natural gas futures rose for the
first time in four days on expectation a government report
tomorrow will show U.S. gas stockpiles increased less than
average for this time of year.  
 The weekly Energy Department report may show that supplies
rose 81 billion cubic feet last week, according to the median of
12 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The five-year
average increase is 85 billion. There will be a “more notable
cool down” in the Midwest and Northeast next week, according to
MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather.  
 “The market is kind of running out of bullish news as we
are seeing cooler weather, so the below-average injection is
helping support gas today,” said  Carl Neill , an energy analyst
at Risk Management Inc. in Chicago.  
 Natural gas for July delivery rose 6.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.821 per million British thermal units at 9:11
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas futures have
gained 13 percent this year.
