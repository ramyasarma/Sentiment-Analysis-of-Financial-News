             Papyless Co. , a Japanese distributor
of electronic books, was set to surge on its first day on the
Osaka Securities Exchange’s Jasdaq market.  
 The  shares  were bid at 4,130 yen, 53 percent higher than
the initial offering price of 2,700 yen, at the 11 a.m. midday
break in Osaka. The shares were not traded as bids outnumbered
offers by 6 to 1.  
 “The company is gaining attention because of expectations
the e-book market will grow after Apple Inc. introduced its
iPads,” said  Toshiaki Iwasaki , an analyst at Mito Securities Co.  
 The Tokyo-based company, which distributes electronic books
that can be read on mobile phones and personal computers,
forecast a 13 percent gain in net income for this fiscal year to
263 million yen ($2.9 million) on a parent basis with a 4
percent increase in sales, according to a statement to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
