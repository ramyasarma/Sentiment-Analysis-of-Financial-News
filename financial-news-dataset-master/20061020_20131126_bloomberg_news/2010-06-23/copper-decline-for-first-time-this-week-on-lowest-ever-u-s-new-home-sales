             Copper fell for the first time in
three days after new-home purchases in the U.S. dropped to a
record, signaling further economic weakening in the world’s
second-biggest consumer of the metal.  
 Sales  collapsed by a record 33 percent to an annual pace of
300,000 last month from April, less than the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the fewest since 1963,
U.S. Commerce Department figures showed. Construction accounts
for a quarter of copper demand, according to the Copper
Development Association.  
 “We are still trading on the back of the macroeconomic
news coming out, and the U.S. economic data is showing a
slowdown,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in
London, said by telephone.  
 Copper futures for September delivery fell 5.6 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $2.9545 a pound on the Comex in New York. The
contract gained 3.8 percent in the previous two days. On the
London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months
slipped 1.4 percent to $6,515 a metric ton, or $2.96 a pound.  
 Purchases of existing houses, which make up about 90
percent of the U.S. market, slid 2.2 percent to a 5.66 million
annual rate, the National Association of Realtors reported
yesterday. Economists had predicted a gain.  
 Comex prices will average $3.22 a pound this year, Morgan
Stanley said today in a report, 3 percent below its prior
estimate. The bank kept its 2011 forecast at $3.41.  
 “Lingering growth concerns in Europe and China are likely
to be a headwind for base metals” in the third quarter,  Peter Richardson , Morgan Stanley’s Melbourne-based chief metals
economist, said in the report. China is the world’s biggest
metals user.  
 Aluminum, nickel, lead and tin also fell on the LME. Zinc
gained.
