             U.S. stocks fell, with the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  dropping for a third day, after new-home
sales sinking to a record low spurred concern about the
durability of the economic recovery ahead of the Federal
Reserve’s announcement about interest rates.  
 Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corp. and DuPont Co. fell more
than 1.8 percent to lead losses in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.  Adobe Systems Inc.  dropped 5.3 percent after
forecasting revenue that may miss the average analyst estimate.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. slumped 3.2 percent as
copper and gold declined.  
 “Housing numbers are ugly with a capital ‘U’,” said
 Michael Mullaney , who manages $9 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co.
in Boston. “It looks like we’re going to double dip in housing.
Investors are concerned.”  
 The  S&P 500  declined 0.4 percent to 1,090.84 as of 10:55
a.m. in New York, extending this week’s slump to 2.7 percent.
The Dow retreated 9.59 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,283.93.
Three stocks fell for every two that rose on U.S. exchanges.  
 Purchases of new homes in the U.S. fell in May to a record
low as a tax credit expired, showing the market remains
dependent on government support.  Sales  collapsed a record 33
percent to an annual pace of 300,000 last month from April, less
than the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News and the fewest in data going back to 1963, figures from the
Commerce Department showed today in Washington. Demand in prior
months was revised down.  
 ‘Tremendous Concern’  
 U.S. stocks sank yesterday as existing-home sales
unexpectedly dropped and the S&P 500 slipped for a second day
below chart levels monitored by analysts. The benchmark for U.S.
equities has gained 3.6 percent since June 7 and completed its
biggest two-week rally since November on June 18 as concern
about Europe’s debt crisis eased.  
 “There’s a tremendous amount of concern about the housing
market,” said  David Lutz , managing director of equity trading
at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore. “Today is FOMC day and
it should be a non-event, given the recent jitters in the global
markets and the weaker housing data coming through.”  
 The Federal Open Market Committee ends a two-day meeting
and releases a policy statement today. Policy makers will hold
the benchmark rate at the record-low range of zero to 0.25
percent today, a Bloomberg survey of economists showed.  
 A gauge of raw-materials producers fell 1.4 percent as
metals prices slumped on concern of slower demand.  
 Freeport, the largest publicly-traded copper producer,
tumbled 3.2 percent to $63.08.  
 Adobe  
 Adobe Systems Inc. had the biggest decline in the S&P 500,
falling 5.3 percent to $31.03. The biggest maker of graphic-
design programs forecast third-quarter revenue will be $950
million to $1 billion. Analysts on average estimated $962
million in sales.  
 Jabil Circuit Inc.  had the biggest gain in the S&P 500,
rising 9 percent to $14.81. The St. Petersburg, Florida-based
electronics manufacturer reported third-quarter profit excluding
some items of 40 cents a share, beating the average analyst
estimate of 34 cents a share in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Philip Morris International Inc.  surged 2.9 percent to
$46.27. The world’s largest publicly traded tobacco maker
forecast 2010 earnings per share will rise as much as 17 percent
as improving markets and price increases offset the declining
euro. EPS should be within a range of $3.70 to $3.80, Chief
Executive Officer  Louis Camilleri  said today in a conference to
investors in Lausanne, Switzerland.  
 “Nobody said the recovery was going to be robust,” said
 James Dunigan , chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management
in Philadelphia, which oversees $104 billion. “However,
businesses are doing well, valuations are in pretty good shape.
There are some pretty good values out there.”
