             About 30 liquefied natural gas
tankers are located off Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates,
with some holding the cleaner-burning fuel, according to a U.S.
energy consultant.  
 The vessels include 26 Q-class tankers with a capacity of
more than 200,000 cubic meters each, Pan EurAsian Enterprises
Inc. said in an e-mailed note yesterday, citing data from
Odysseus tracking service.  
 The total capacity of the ships is about 6.4 million cubic
meters, or about 13 percent of the world’s floating LNG capacity,
according to the Pan EurAsian note. The 30 ships hold about 135
billion cubic feet of natural gas, it said.  
 An oversupply of gas and weak demand has sent spot charter
rates to the lowest in five years. Qatar, the world’s biggest
producer of LNG, was idling at least eight tankers in the Gulf
of Oman, according to ship-tracking data from AIS Live Ltd. as
of June 3. The vessels have a combined capacity of 1.8 million
cubic meters, enough to supply the U.K. for more than a month.  
 Imports into the U.K. for June are at their lowest level
since October, led by declines at the South Hook terminal, the
main importer of LNG, according to the consultant. Qatar is a
supplier to South Hook.  
 Qatar will idle 66 percent of its export plants this year,
according to Poten & Partners.  
 LNG is created by cooling gas to about minus 260 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 162 degrees Celsius), shrinking it to about a
600th of the original volume, according to the U.S. Department
of Energy.
