             Jamaica extended a state of
emergency to contain gang violence after police captured an
alleged drug lord and sought to extradite him to the U.S.  
 “The pressure on the criminal forces in the country is not
something that we can afford to slacken in any way,” Prime
Minister  Bruce Golding  said in a speech to parliament late
yesterday.  
 The state of emergency, which was declared May 23 after
efforts to extradite Christopher “Dudus” Coke provoked violent
street clashes, will last another month, Golding said.  
 Coke was arrested at a roadside checkpoint and will be
handed over to the U.S. within 48 hours, Police Commissioner
Owen Ellington told reporters yesterday. Security forces remain
on a heightened state of alert for fear of gang reprisals, he
said.  
 At least 74 people were killed when police battled with
Coke’s supporters and employees in Kingston, the capital.
Jamaica is seeking $1 billion in loans and grants to rid the
country of drug gangs that have taken over poor neighborhoods on
the Caribbean island and hurt economic growth, Finance Minister
 Audley Shaw  has said.
