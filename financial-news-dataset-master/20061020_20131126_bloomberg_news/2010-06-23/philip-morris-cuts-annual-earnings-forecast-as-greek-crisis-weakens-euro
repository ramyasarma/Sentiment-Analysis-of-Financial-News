             Philip Morris International Inc., 
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco maker, forecast 2010
earnings per share will rise as much as 17 percent as improving
markets and price increases offset the declining euro.  
 The earnings should be within a range of $3.70 to $3.80,
Chief Executive Officer  Louis Camilleri  said today in a
conference to investors in Lausanne, Switzerland, that was
available via the company’s website. While that’s 5 cents less
than the cigarette maker forecast in April, the strength of the
dollar has led to a reduction of 20 cents, the company said.
Philip Morris reports in dollars and has no  sales  in the U.S.  
 Improved markets and higher prices will add 8 cents to
earnings per share, the CEO said. Philip Morris, which has
delayed raising prices in Japan to stay in line with rivals,
plans an increase to offset an “unprecedented” 70 yen (77
cents) a pack increase in taxes, Chief Financial Officer  Hermann Waldemer  said on the webcast. Japan Tobacco Inc., which controls
65 percent of its home market, said April 30 it plans to raise
prices in October when the higher tax takes effect.  
 “We are now more optimistic on the likely impact of the
tax increase in Japan on profitability,” Waldemer said on the
webcast. He said the company also recently announced plans to
raise prices in Russia by 2 rubles (6 cents) to 3 rubles a pack.  
 Philip Morris rose $1.50, or 3.3 percent, to $46.49 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The
shares have fallen 3.5 percent this year.  
 Euro Decline  
 New York-based Philip Morris last year got 32 percent of
its revenue after tobacco taxes from members of the euro zone,
Waldemer said. The euro has dropped 14 percent against the
dollar this year, hurt by the Greek debt crisis.  
 “The currency outlook has of course radically changed
since April as a result of the debt crisis in Greece and the
spread of concerns to other countries in the euro zone,”
Waldemer said on the webcast.  
 Tax benefits after concluding an audit add 7 cents a share
to the company’s earnings forecast, Camilleri said.
