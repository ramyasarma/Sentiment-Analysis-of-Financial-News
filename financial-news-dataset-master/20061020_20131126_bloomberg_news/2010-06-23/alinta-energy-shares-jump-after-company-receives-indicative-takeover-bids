             Alinta Energy Ltd. , an Australian
electricity generator with interests in 12 operating power
stations, rose the most in almost 10 months after the company
said it received a number of takeover bids.  
 Alinta  gained  2.5 Australian cents, or 56 percent, to 7
cents at 2:55 p.m. in Sydney, the biggest increase since Aug. 26,
valuing the company at about A$56.5 million ($49.2 million). The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index was 1.2 percent lower.  
 The power generator hired Lazard Ltd. as an adviser to
study proposals to reduce debt, including asset sales, Alinta
said in April. The indicative, non-binding, confidential bids
are for both the entire company and parts of the business,
Alinta said in a statement today.  
 Origin Energy Ltd., the Australian electricity and gas
retailer that has about A$3.7 billion of cash and undrawn debt,
may acquire assets from Alinta, according to analysts from
Credit Suisse Group AG Goldman Sachs JBWere.  
 A decision hasn’t been made on the bids, Alinta said. The
company reaffirmed its fiscal 2010 earnings guidance of A$288
million.
