             The government of Guinea threatened
to deny Rio Tinto Plc one or more of its rights to one of the
world’s largest undeveloped iron-ore deposits, the Financial
Times reported, citing a letter from the office of outgoing
president General Sekouba Konate, the newspaper said it saw.  
 Guinea officials have been angered by what they regard as
Rio’s failure to acknowledge a 2008 government decision to
reclaim the rights to half the ore deposit, the newspaper said.
