             Germany aims to double the amount of
ethanol allowed in gasoline blends by the end of the year, an
agriculture ministry official said, a change that may give a
boost to domestic biofuel producers including  CropEnergies AG .  
 The ethanol content would be increased to 10 percent by
volume from 5 percent now, Clemens Neumann, who heads the
ministry’s section responsible for sustainable agriculture and
forestry, said today in Berlin.  
 Biofuel and biodiesel made up 5.4 percent of total
transportation fuels last year in Germany. Use of fuels made
from plants has fallen in Europe’s largest economy after the
government eliminated tax exemptions for consumers.
