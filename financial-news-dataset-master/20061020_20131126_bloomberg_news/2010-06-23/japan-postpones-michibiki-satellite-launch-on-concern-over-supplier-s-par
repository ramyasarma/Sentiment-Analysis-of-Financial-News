             Japan postponed the launch of a
rocket carrying the Michibiki satellite because of concerns over
a component produced by an overseas supplier, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said.  
 The new launch date is undecided, Mitsubishi Heavy and JAXA
said in a joint statement on the heavy machinery maker’s website
that didn’t identify the manufacturer of the part in question.
Mitsubishi and JAXA said earlier this month the rocket would be
launched on Aug. 2.
