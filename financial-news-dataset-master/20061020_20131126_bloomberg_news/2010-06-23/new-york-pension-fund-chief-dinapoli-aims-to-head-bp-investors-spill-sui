             New York Comptroller  Thomas P. DiNapoli , trustee of the $132.6 billion  State Common Retirement
Fund , said he hired a law firm to represent the fund in a class-
action investor lawsuit against BP Plc.  
 The state fund will seek lead-plaintiff status in an action
stemming from the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in
the Gulf of Mexico in April, DiNapoli said today in a statement.
He said the fund held more than 19 million shares of BP at the
time. He retained the law Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC,
the comptroller said.  
 “BP misled investors about its safety procedures and its
ability to respond to events like the ongoing oil spill, and
we’re going to hold it accountable,” DiNapoli said in the
statement.  
 BP fell 0.7 pence to 333.5 pence today in London  trading .
The shares have dropped 49 percent since the Deepwater blast.  
 Four actions are pending against BP, one in California and
three in Louisiana,  Robert Whalen , a spokesman for the
comptroller, said in a telephone interview. DiNapoli believes
the suits will be consolidated at some point and wants Cohen
Milstein to manage the litigation on the state’s behalf, Whalen
said.  
 New York’s pension fund provides benefits to more than 1
million state and local government employees, police officers,
and firefighters.
