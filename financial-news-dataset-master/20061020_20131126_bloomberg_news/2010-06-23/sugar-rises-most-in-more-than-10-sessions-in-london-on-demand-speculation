             Sugar fell for the second straight
session, erasing earlier gains, as equities tumbled after sales
of new houses in the U.S. slumped, signaling the economic
recovery may be faltering. Cocoa and coffee were mixed.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell for the third
consecutive day as purchases of new homes plunged in May to the
lowest level on record after a tax credit ended, showing the
market is still dependent on government support. Crude oil
declined after a U.S. government report showed an unexpected
increase in supplies.  
 “The market’s pulling back sharply on equities and energy
prices,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “That’s the main pullback.
Everyone’s pulling out of the risk short term.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery lost 0.11 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 15.81 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
In London, refined-sugar futures for October delivery dropped
2.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $464.90 a metric ton on the Liffe
exchange.  
 Earlier, raw-sugar prices reached 16.35 cents, the highest
level for a most-active contract since April 23. Refined-sugar
prices rose 12 percent this month through yesterday.  
 Pakistan plans to purchase 200,000 metric tons of refined
sugar and will invite bidders next week, according to a state-
run agency.  
 “The market has been marked by higher buying interest,”
said  Bruno Lima , a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group
in Campinas, Brazil. “The demand is expected to remain strong
in the short term.”  
 Cocoa for September delivery moved up $8, or 0.3 percent,
to $3,063 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa for July delivery
slid 16 pounds, 0.6 percent to 2,500 pounds ($3,727) a ton on
the Liffe.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery declined 0.25
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.605 a pound in New York, the third
straight decline. In London, robusta beans for September
delivery gained $11, or 0.7 percent, to $1,580 a ton.
