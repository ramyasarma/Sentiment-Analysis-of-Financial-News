             South Korea’s won may climb 3.7
percent by the end of next week after the currency completed a
“double bottom” against the greenback, according to Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.  
 The won on June 21 rose beyond 1,191.90 per dollar, the
strongest level reached between its May and June lows of
1,277.85 and 1,271.45, and this is a bullish signal for the
currency, said  Minoru Shioiri , chief manager of foreign-exchange
trading in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ. The won may appreciate to
1,144.15 next week, Shioiri said, citing a Fibonacci chart that
is based on a sequence of numbers.  
 “The trend for the won should remain bullish as long as it
trades stronger than the 1,200 level,” Shioiri said. “Declines
today and yesterday are considered just a temporary
correction.”  
 The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,186.23 per dollar as of
12:40 p.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
yesterday slid 0.9 percent, after jumping 2.6 percent on June 21
and 3.6 percent last week.  
 The currency slid from 1,102.85 on April 26, the strongest
level since September 2008, to a 10-month low of 1,277.85 on May
25. Shiori’s forecast rate of 1,144.15 would represent a 76.4
percent retracement of that decline. Fibonacci analysis is based
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low. Significant levels are 23.6
percent, 38.2 percent, 61.8 percent and 76.4 percent.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
