             Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi said the global economic crisis may delay the
construction of a 6.3 billion-euro suspension bridge linking the
island of Sicily to the mainland.  
 “The timing of the work will have to take into account
public financial resources, which in turn are influenced by the
global economic crisis,” Berlusconi said in audio remarks
posted today on the website www.forzasilvio.it.
