             OAO Gazprom  “must see the money”
before lifting natural-gas supply reductions to Belarus,
spokesman  Sergei Kupriyanov  said today, commenting on reports
that the country paid off its debt for natural-gas supplies.  
 Belarus paid its debt for natural-gas supplies to OAO
Gazprom in full, transferring $187 million to Gazprom at 4 p.m.
local time today, Interfax reported, citing First Deputy Prime
Minister  Vladimir Semashko .  
 Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly, reduced deliveries
to Belarus by 60 percent today, demanding $192 million for past
deliveries, Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  said. The
Moscow-based company widened the cut from 30 percent yesterday
and 15 percent the day before, Miller said.  
 Belarus borrowed $200 million to make the payment, and
demands that Gazprom pay off its own $260 million debt for
transits of the Russian fuel further to Europe by 10 a.m. in
Minsk time tomorrow, Interfax quoted Semashko as saying.  
 Belarus will halt the transit if the payment isn’t made,
the Moscow-based news service quoted the official from Minsk.  
 The dispute over mutual debts jeopardized gas deliveries to
the European Union, which gets about 20 percent of Russian gas
from across Belarus, the second transit route after Ukraine. Gas
flows across Belarus to Lithuania, and Russia’s Kaliningrad
exclave on the Baltic Sea, dropped 40 percent at 4 p.m. in
Vilnius today, Lietuvos Dujos AB spokeswoman Sigita Petrikonyte-
Jurkuniene said by phone.
