             Clear Channel Communications Inc. 
said  Mark Mays  is stepping down as chief executive officer, the
latest member of the founding family to resign since the largest
U.S. radio broadcaster was taken private two years ago.  
 Mays asked the board to start a search for his replacement,
the San Antonio-based company said today in a statement. He will
continue as chairman, a post he has held since last year.  
 Mays, who has been CEO since October 2004, will continue in
that capacity until a replacement is found, which Clear Channel
expects to happen later this year. He’s the son of  L. Lowry Mays , who founded the company in 1972 and built it into the
largest owner of U.S. radio stations. Another son,  Randall Mays ,
stepped down as president and chief financial officer last year.  
 “After 21 wonderful years of building the industry leader
that is Clear Channel, I have made a personal decision to step
away from the chief executive role,” Mark Mays said in the
statement. “This is an opportune time for a new CEO to work
with the management team in leading our terrific company
forward.”  
 Clear Channel, which also owns billboards, was taken
private in July 2008 in a $17.9 billion buyout led by Bain
Capital Partners LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP.  
 The board hired executive search firm Egon Zehnder
International to help find a CEO.  
 CC Media Holdings Inc. shares, the remaining publicly
traded equity of the company, rose 40 cents to $8.75 yesterday
in over-the-counter  trading . The shares have almost tripled this
year.
