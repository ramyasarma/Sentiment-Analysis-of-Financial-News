             Chile’s central bank may raise its
benchmark interest rate for a second straight month in July as a
recovering economy pushes inflation back up to policy makers’ 3
percent target, a  survey  of traders and investors showed.  
 The bank’s board, led by bank President  Jose De Gregorio ,
will lift the overnight rate a half-point to 1.5 percent,
according to the median forecast of 36 money-market traders,
pension and mutual fund managers and insurance companies. The
bi-weekly survey was published on the bank’s website today.  
 The central bank increased borrowing costs on June 15 for
the first time since September 2008. Growing consumer spending
and a lag in output caused by the 8.8-magnitude earthquake in
February may help push inflation to 3.5 percent in 12 months,
today’s survey showed. That compares with 3.45 percent in the
previous survey published June 9.  
 Policy makers may raise rates to 2.75 percent in six
months, 4.25 percent in 12 months and 5 percent in 18 months,
according to today’s survey.  
 Chile’s peso, which has appreciated 2 percent in the last
month to 532.75 per U.S. dollar at 9:12 a.m. New York time, will
reach 530 in seven days, today’s survey showed.
