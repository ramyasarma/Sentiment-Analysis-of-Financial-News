             Auckland Airport’s domestic terminal
reopened just before 9 a.m. after the discovery of a suspicious
package about 80 minutes earlier prompted an evacuation, the New
Zealand Herald reported. The package was harmless, police said.
The evacuation caused minimal delays, an airport spokesman said,
according to the newspaper.
