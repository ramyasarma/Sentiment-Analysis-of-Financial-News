             Crude oil declined in New York for a
second day amid evidence that demand is falling in the U.S., the
world’s largest energy consumer.  
 Crude inventories increased 3.69 million barrels last week
for a second week, according to a report late yesterday from the
industry-funded American Petroleum Institute. A U.S. government
report on inventories today may show a drawdown. European equity
markets declined.  
 “The API figures were very bad. They pushed the market
lower,”  Roland Stenzel , a crude and carbon trader at E&T
Energie Handelsgesellschaft mbH, said from Vienna. “Equities
could be negative for the market today.”  
 Crude for August delivery fell as much as 81 cents, or 1
percent, to $77.04 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and traded at $77.51 a barrel as of
11:50 a.m. London time.  
 The July contract dropped 61 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $77.21 a barrel and expired at the close of floor
trading yesterday. Futures are down 2.3 percent this year.  
 Brent crude for August delivery dropped as much as 73
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $77.31 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was at $77.77 a barrel at 11:50
a.m. London time.  
 Crude supplies at  Cushing , Oklahoma, the delivery point for
the New York futures, gained 386,000 barrels to about 37.96
million, the API said yesterday. That’s 36,000 barrels below a
record reported for the week to May 14.  
 DOE Estimates  
 Today’s U.S. Department of Energy report may show U.S.
 crude  inventories fell 800,000 barrels in the week ended June 18
from 363.1 million, according to the median estimate from 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Gasoline stockpiles may
have slipped 180,000 barrels.  
 U.S. distillate inventories, including heating oil and
diesel, probably rose 1.5 million barrels, according to the
Bloomberg survey. That would mark a  fourth weekly  increase.  
 “Gasoil stocks have resumed their increase, highlighting a
risk of replaying last year’s constitution of a massive gasoil
overhang,” Credit Agricole CIB analyst  Christophe Barret  wrote
in a report today. Inventories are about 4 percent higher than
the same time last year.  
 Distillates increased 1.1 million barrels to 154.7 million,
a four-month high, according to the API. The Energy Department
is due to release its weekly report at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  
 IEA Outlook  
 The International Energy Agency, an adviser to oil-
consuming nations, said growth in world oil demand will slow in
the next five years as the pace of Chinese consumption slows.  
 Growth will shrink every year to average 1 percent in 2015,
or 940,000 barrels a day, from 1.9 percent, or 1.62 million
barrels a day, in 2010, the Paris-based agency said today.  
 The first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season may enter
the Gulf of Mexico as soon as next week, possibly disrupting BP
Plc’s efforts to clean up the oil spill in that area.  
 A system of thunderstorms in the Caribbean Sea is moving
west-northwest toward the Gulf at 10 miles (16 kilometers) per
hour, bringing rainfall to parts of the Dominican Republic,
Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said
in its latest update at 8 p.m. local time yesterday.  
 Credit Agricole expects New York crude prices to average
$76 a barrel in the third quarter, rising to $78 a barrel at the
end of 2010, according to today’s report.
