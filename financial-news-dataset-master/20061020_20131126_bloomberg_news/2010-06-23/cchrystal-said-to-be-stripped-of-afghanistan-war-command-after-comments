             President Barack Obama ousted U.S.
Army General Stanley McChrystal for belittling remarks about
administration officials just over a year after he was entrusted
with salvaging a losing war in Afghanistan, according to an
administration official.  
 McChrystal will be replaced by General David Petraeus, the
official said.
