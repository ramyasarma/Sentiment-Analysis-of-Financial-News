             PT Bumi Resources  is in talks with
 China Investment Corp. ,  Credit Suisse AG ,  JPMorgan Chase Bank NA ,
and  Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG  on the Indonesian coal
producer’s plan to sell new shares.  
 Bumi plans to raise $495.9 million by selling 1.94 billion
new shares at 2,366 rupiah (26 cents) apiece through a non-
preemptive issue and use the proceeds to pay debt, the company
said in a statement published in Bisnis Indonesia.  PT Bakrie &
Brothers  owns 9.79 percent of Bumi, the company said today.  
 The offer, an average of share prices between April 15 and
May 20, is 22.6 percent more than yesterday’s close, according
to Bloomberg calculations. A non-preemptive issue is a new share
issuance in which current shareholders have no right to purchase.  
 Bumi, based in Jakarta, plans to seek shareholders’
approval tomorrow. Bakrie & Brothers is an investment company
controlled by the family of  Aburizal Bakrie , Indonesia’s fourth-
richest man, according to Forbes Asia.  
 Bumi  fell 0.5 percent to 1,920 rupiah in Jakarta trading at
9:28 a.m. The stock has dropped 20 percent this year compared
with a 16 percent gain in the benchmark Jakarta Composite Index.
