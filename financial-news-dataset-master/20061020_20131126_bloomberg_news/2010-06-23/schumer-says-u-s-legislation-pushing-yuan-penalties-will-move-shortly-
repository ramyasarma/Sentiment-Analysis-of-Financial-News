             New York Senator Charles Schumer,
sponsor of legislation to push China to raise the value of its
currency, said he will move “shortly” to force a vote in the
Senate.  
 China’s announcement that it would end a peg of the yuan to
the dollar would not “placate” lawmakers, Schumer said today
at a Senate Finance Committee heating. Schumer predicted his
measure would pass the Senate with overwhelming support.
