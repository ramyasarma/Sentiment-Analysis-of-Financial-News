             Italy’s jobless rate may continue to
climb as the economic recovery prompts more unemployed workers
who had previously given up on finding work to seek jobs, Labor
Minister Maurizio Sacconi said.  
 “The unemployment rate may well keep rising in coming
months as the economic recovery will push more of those so far
discouraged to seek a job and present themselves on the labor
market,” Sacconi told reporters in Rome today. “This would
mean that the rate of ‘inactivity’ will decline.”  
 Italy’s jobless rate rose to a seasonally adjusted 8.9
percent in April as employers remained reluctant to hire even
with stronger growth in Europe reviving exports and helping the
euro region’s third-biggest economy return to growth.
