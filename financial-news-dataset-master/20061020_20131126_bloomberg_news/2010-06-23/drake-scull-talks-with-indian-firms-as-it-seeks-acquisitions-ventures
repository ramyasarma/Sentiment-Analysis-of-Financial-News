             Drake & Scull International PJSC , a
Dubai-based mechanical, electrical and plumbing company, said
it’s talking with potential partners in India on entering the
subcontinent’s market.  
 The company is seeking joint ventures in India or to “grow
with a family-owned company,” Chief Executive Officer  Khaldoun Tabari  said today at a news conference in Dubai. Drake & Scull
has 700 million dirhams ($191 million) for acquisitions and is
seeking two purchases in Saudi Arabia’s civil engineering
market, he said.  
 Drake & Scull  expects a 5 billion-dirham to 6 billion-
dirham order backlog by the end of the year as new contracts
pick up in the second half, Tabari said. The backlog as of the
end of March was 4 billion dirhams, a 48 percent increase from a
year earlier.  
 Earnings will probably improve in the second quarter, Chief
Financial Officer  Osama Hamdan  said at the briefing. Drake &
Scull reported in May that first-quarter  net income  dropped 39
percent to 42 million dirhams, while revenue fell 21 percent to
386 million dirhams, because of delays on some projects and
start-up work on new contracts in Egypt, Oman and Saudi Arabia.  
 The company is bidding for 40 to 50 contracts, Tabari said
in May. Drake & Scull won orders valued at 240 million dirhams
in Abu Dhabi, it said on June 21.  
 Drake & Scull  fell  for a third consecutive day, declining
by 0.5 percent to 81.2 fils. The stock has dropped 9.8 percent
this year, valuing the company at 1.77 billion dirhams.
