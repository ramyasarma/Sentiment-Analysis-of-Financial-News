             South African employment data
released yesterday was “depressing” and government and
industry must do more to combat job losses, Finance Minister
Pravin Gordhan told reporters in the capital, Pretoria, today.  
 South Africa’s economy shed 79,000 jobs in the first
quarter, Statistics South African said yesterday. Employment in
the formal, non-agricultural economy dropped 1 percent to 8.08
million, after gaining a revised 0.2 percent in the fourth
quarter.
