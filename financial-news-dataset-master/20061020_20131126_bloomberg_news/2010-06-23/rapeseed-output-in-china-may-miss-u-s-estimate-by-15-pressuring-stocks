             Rapeseed output in China, the
world’s largest consumer, may be as much as 15 percent smaller
than estimated, adding pressure on global stockpiles and helping
support soybean oil prices, the Linn Group said.  
 “China’s crop is considered more at peril” than other
producers,  Jerrod Kitt , an analyst at the Chicago-based
commodity researcher and brokerage, said in a report e-mailed
today. The country’s output may be 1.5 million metric tons to 2
million tons smaller than the 13 million tons  forecast  by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture on June 10, he said.  
 Reduced output in China may help push rapeseed stockpiles
below the 2007-2008 level, as Canada, the largest exporter, was
forecast to lose 2 million tons of production in the 2010-2011
season on persistent wet weather, Kitt said. Canada accounts for
60 percent of global shipments of rapeseed.  
 The USDA forecast on June 10 that rapeseed output in Canada
would rise to 12 million tons in the year beginning August, from
11.825 million tons this year.  
 “The obvious beneficiary to a tight rapeseed situation is
soybean oil,” Kitt said. “As rapeseed goes into what appears
to be a potential rationing situation, some of the more
discretionary industrial consumption could be priced out of the
market and move over to bean oil.”  
 Rapeseed futures have gained 16 percent this year on the
NYSE Liffe in Paris as demand from importers including China and
Japan exceeds supply. Global imports may rise 4.7 percent to
10.9 million tons, while exports were estimated to drop 1.9
percent to 10.7 million tons, according to the USDA’s forecast
on June 10.  
 Soybean oil traded in Chicago has gained 5.9 percent from
June 10 through yesterday as excessive rains delay fieldwork in
Canada, narrowing the commodity’s loss to 4.6 percent this year.
Soybean oil and soybean futures have dropped this year as global
supplies expanded.
