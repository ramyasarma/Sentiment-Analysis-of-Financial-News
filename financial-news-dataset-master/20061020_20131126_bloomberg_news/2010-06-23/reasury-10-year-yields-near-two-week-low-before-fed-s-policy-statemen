             Treasury 10-year note yields held at
almost the  lowest  level in two weeks on speculation the Federal
Reserve will cite evidence of a stalled economic recovery when
it releases its policy statement today.  
 Five-week note  yields  were little changed before the
Treasury auctions $38 billion of the securities. Yesterday the
government sold $40 billion of two-year notes at a record low
yield of 0.738 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee may
reiterate at the end of its two-day meeting a commitment to an
“extended period” of low interest rates.  
 “Today’s FOMC statement should underpin the overall
positive trend in Treasuries,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-
income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “The positive
mood made yesterday’s supply rather an opportunity to add” to
bond holdings, he said.  
 The 10-year note’s yield increased one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.18 percent at 7:44 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in May 2020 dropped 2/32, or 63 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 102 23/32. The yield earlier fell to 3.14
percent, the lowest level since June 8.  
 At yesterday auction of two-year notes, the bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of debt on offer, was 3.45, the highest since October.
Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 41.4 percent of the notes, the most
since February.  
 Two-Year Yield  
 The current  two-year  note’s yield fell yesterday to 0.68
percent, the lowest level since May 25. The five-year note’s
yield was little changed today at 1.97 percent after touching
1.94 percent, the lowest level since June 8.  
 The five-year notes being sold today yielded 2 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 2.13 percent at the previous
offering on May 26. Investors bid for 2.71  times  the amount on
sale last month, compared with an average of 2.65 for the past
10 auctions. Indirect bidders purchased 41 percent of the
securities, compared with the 10-sale average of 48 percent.  
 The U.S. is scheduled to auction $30 billion of seven-year
notes tomorrow.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.1 percent following
yesterday’s 0.5 percent loss. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
declined 1.1 percent.  
 Sales of  new homes  slumped 19 percent in May to a 410,000
annual pace, according to the median forecast of 76 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce Department’s
report today. The drop would be the biggest in 16 years.  
 Existing-Home Sales  
 Purchases of existing houses unexpectedly slid 2.2 percent
to a 5.66 million pace, the National Association of Realtors
said yesterday. The median forecast of 74 economists was for a 6
percent increase.  
 The Fed will hold its  target rate  for overnight lending
between banks at a record low zero to 0.25 percent, according to
all 97 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Policy makers have
kept the benchmark at that level since December 2008.  
 The difference in yield between five-year Treasuries and
similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
indicates investors anticipate an annual  inflation  rate of 1.66
percent over the term of the securities, down from 2.01 percent
on April 28, when the Fed ended its previous policy meeting.  
 Interest rates in major economies “will probably remain
low for a protracted period,”  Michael Amey , executive vice
president of U.K. fixed income in London at Pacific Investment
Management Co., said in an interview on “Countdown” on
Bloomberg Television. “We do see plenty of spare capacity
globally.”

                          June 23 (Bloomberg) -- David Kelly, chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about his strategy for U.S. stocks and fixed-income investments.
     U.S. stocks sank yesterday, with benchmark gauges declining the most in almost three weeks, as home sales unexpectedly dropped and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped for a second day below chart levels monitored by analysts. Kelly, speaking from Cleveland, Ohio, also discusses Federal Reserve policy, the outlook for the U.S. economy, and China's shift in currency policy.
