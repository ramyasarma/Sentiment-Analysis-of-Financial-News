             German Foreign Minister Guido
Westerwelle called on Russia and Belarus to set aside their
disagreement over a finance dispute that’s disrupted gas transit
into Europe.   
 “I call on both sides in this dispute to come quickly to
an amicable agreement,” Westerwelle said in a statement
distributed by the German Foreign Ministry. “I expect that all
participants are aware of their responsibility as gas suppliers
as well as gas-transit countries.”
