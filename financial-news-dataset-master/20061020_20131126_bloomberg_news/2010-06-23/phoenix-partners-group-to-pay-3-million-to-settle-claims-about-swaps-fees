             Phoenix Partners Group will pay $3
million to settle regulatory claims that three of its brokers
improperly tried to influence the fees it earns from matching
trades in the credit-default swaps market.  
 Phoenix brokers Marcos Brodsky, Jon Lines and Wesley Wang
“engaged in improper communications with other interdealer
brokers about CDS dealers’ brokerage rate proposals,” the
Washington-based Financial Industry Regulatory Authority wrote
today in a complaint.  
 Phoenix Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Stephan said today
in an e-mailed statement that the claims were part of an
industrywide investigation “conducted during a period when
Phoenix was an upstart firm with about 25 employees and
virtually no market share.”  
 “We would have preferred to fight this matter to its
conclusion,” he said. “We determined the commercially
expedient course of action was to settle this matter and focus
on our growing business.”
