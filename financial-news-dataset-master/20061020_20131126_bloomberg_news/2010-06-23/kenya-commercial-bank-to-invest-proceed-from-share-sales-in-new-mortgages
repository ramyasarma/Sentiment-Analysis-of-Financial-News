             Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. , the East
African nation’s biggest lender by branches, said it plans to
invest the proceeds of its sale of shares to existing
stockholders in mortgage lending.  
 The lender will place 15.9 billion shillings ($196 million)
in Kenya and neighboring countries including Uganda, Rwanda and
Tanzania, Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Sam Kimani  told a
stockbrokers’ meeting today in the capital, Nairobi.  
 About 13 billion shillings will be invested in Kenya, 1.5
billion shillings in Uganda, 500 million shillings in Rwanda and
900 million shillings in Tanzania, Kimani said. In Southern
Sudan, where the lender has 10 outlets, Kenya Commercial won’t
make any new investments, he said.  
 “We want to grow our mortgage business. We need long-term
capital,” Kimani said.  
 Kenya Commercial intends to grow its share of all net
interest income earned by the country’s lenders to 20 percent by
the end of this year, compared with 15 percent in 2009, Chief
Executive Officer  Martin Oduor-Otieno  told the meeting.  
 The lender said June 15 its existing shareholders can apply
to receive two shares for every five held at 17 shillings
apiece. The rights issue offer opens July 1 and closes July 23.  
 The East African government’s shareholding will be reduced
to 16.86 percent from 23.6 percent because it won’t take part in
the offer. The government didn’t take part in two previous
rights issues that raised 2.3 billion shillings in 2004 and 5.2
billion shillings in 2008, the lender said June 15.
