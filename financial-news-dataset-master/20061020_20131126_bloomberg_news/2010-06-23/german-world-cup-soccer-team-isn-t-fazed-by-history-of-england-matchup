             Germany’s youngest squad in 76 years
is pleased for the opportunity to make a bit of its own World
Cup history with its second-round match with England.  
 “It’s a big history,” Germany captain  Philipp Lahm  told
reporters after his team’s 1-0 win over Ghana last night. “It’s
always big games, interesting games. Every player watched the
Germany against England games. We can all be happy to play
against England.”  
 The victory against Ghana took Germany through to the round
of 16 as the Group D winner and preserved its record of never
having failed to go beyond the first group stage at the World
Cup. England earlier finished behind the U.S. in its pool.  
 Germany and England have faced each other  four times  before
at the four-yearly championship, with three-time winner Germany
triumphing in a penalty shootout when the teams last met in the
1990 semifinals. England’s 4-2 victory over the Germans in the
1966 final remains the only time it won soccer’s biggest prize.  
 “Playing England is always a special moment for us,”
Germany coach  Joachim Loew  said at a post-match news conference.
“It has a great history. It’s going to be a wonderful
opportunity for us.”  
 Loew, missing injured players including captain  Michael Ballack  and first-choice goalkeeper  Rene Adler , has assembled
Germany’s youngest World Cup squad since 1934, with an average
age of 24.9. Only North Korea and Ghana had younger rosters
among the 32 teams that started the tournament in South Africa.  
 Pressure  
 Lahm, 26, said the squad coped with the “extreme
pressure” of having to beat Ghana to guarantee its progress.
The African team entered the game requiring a draw to be sure of
advancing after beating Serbia and tying Australia, while the
Germans were forced to rebound from their upset 1-0 defeat to
Serbia in their previous match.  
 Germany has proved its mental strength in the opening
round, Lahm said.  
 “We are young but mentally we are good,” Lahm said.
“Maybe it will be penalty kicks and we are prepared for it. We
are ready to fight and we will see who’s in the next round.”  
 Loew said that England was still an “incredibly
dangerous” team even after drawing its first two matches and
only ensuring its place in the knockout phases with a 1-0 win
over Slovenia yesterday.  
 “Their first two matches they were struggling,” Loew
said. “But it’s normal that some teams pick up form later in
the tournament, make no mistake it’s a wonderful team.”  
 German players say they’re focusing on England.  
 “We have to look forward,” Germany midfielder Marcell
Jansen, 24, told reporters. “In history much has happened and
so for the fans and players it will be a great game.”
