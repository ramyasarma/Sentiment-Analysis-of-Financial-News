             Germany’s government is expecting
unemployment to fall to fewer than 3 million people this autumn,
perhaps as early as October, the Rheinische Post newspaper said
in an advance report, citing unidentified high-ranking people in
the government. The forecast is due both to a better-than-
expected economy and changes in the way unemployment is
calculated, the newspaper said.
