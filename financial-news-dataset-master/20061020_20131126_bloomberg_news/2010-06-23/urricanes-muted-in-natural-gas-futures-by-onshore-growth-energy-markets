             Natural gas futures show hurricane
season in the Gulf of Mexico will do less damage to production
than in 2005 as supplies from offshore wells decline.  
 Government forecasters  say the current hurricane season may
be  the worst since that year , when storms including Katrina,
which devastated New Orleans, damaged platforms and pipelines in
the Gulf of Mexico and helped send gas to a record $15.78 per
million British thermal units by December.  
 The premium of futures for delivery in September over July
was almost five times higher in 2006, the first season following
Katrina, than it is this year, as production moved to more
reliable onshore sites. About  10 percent  of U.S. gas output
comes from federal waters in the Gulf, down from 17 percent five
years ago, according to the Energy Department in Washington.  
 “Gas futures show that the market has not put significant
weight on this year’s hurricanes,” said  Teri Viswanath ,
director of commodities research at Credit Suisse Securities USA
in Houston. “There is nothing unusual that would suggest the
market is unduly concerned about the active season.”  
 Natural gas for July delivery fell 5.6 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $4.748 per million British thermal units
today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 15 percent this
year.  
 Gas for delivery in September, when  forecasters expect the
most storms , closed at $4.895 per million Btu yesterday, a
premium of 9.1 cents, or 1.9 percent to July. The premium of
September over July for delivery in 2006 was 43 cents, or 6.9
percent.  
 “In 2005, you could’ve never foreseen that we would have
hurricanes Rita and Katrina,” Viswanath said. “The most
reasonable explanation for the July-September price spread in
2006 is that traders required, and received, a risk premium.”  
 Record Prices  
 Katrina hit New Orleans in August 2005, killing more than
1,800 people as levees failed, flooding the city. Rita, a month
later, caused damage from Florida to Texas.  
 Together, the two hurricanes destroyed 113 offshore
platforms and damaged 457 gas and oil pipelines, according to  a
report  from the U.S. Minerals Management Service on May 1, 2006.
The storms reduced offshore gas output by as much 80 percent.  
 Storms this year may cut output by 166 billion cubic feet,
the Energy Department estimated in  a monthly report on June 8 .
That’s equal to about three days of overall gas production from
wells in the lower 48 states.  
 Inventory Cushion  
 “Some offshore production will get shut in for a period of
time but I don’t think it’s a big deal, since you still have
lots of gas in storage,” said  Martin King , an analyst at
FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. “Hurricanes are more of a
bearish event now because of the impact on demand.”  
 U.S. gas stockpiles rose to  2.543 trillion cubic feet  in
the week ended June 11, 14 percent above the five-year average.
Inventory levels this year may approach last year’s record of
3.837 trillion cubic feet, the department said in the June 8
report.  
 “We still have a pretty decent amount of storage right
now, and it lessens the blow of any disruption,”  Viswanath 
said.  
 Storms this year may also cut 26 million barrels of oil
production in the Gulf, equal to about 1.8 days of refinery
consumption, according to Energy Department estimates. The  U.S.
imports  about 65 percent of its crude supply.  
 “Typically, hurricanes do not have much of an impact on
oil prices because any shortfall in production can be made up by
imports,” said  James Williams , an economist at energy research
firm WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. “For natural gas, the
impact is also declining.”  
 Oil Market  
 Crude for August delivery rose 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$76.51 a barrel in New York. Yesterday, September futures were
up 68 cents, or 0.9 percent, from August at $77.03. The premium
of September to August in 2006 was 90 cents, or 1.3 percent.  
 Marketed gas production from federal tracts in the Gulf
fell 700 billion cubic feet, or 22 percent, to 2.43 trillion
cubic feet in 2009 from 3.13 trillion in 2005, Energy Department
data show.  
 Output has dropped by 52 percent since 1999, when the Gulf
accounted for about 25 percent of U.S. production. Marketed gas,
representing supplies available for consumers, is overall output
minus impurities and gas used in the production process.  
 Production rose 2.97 trillion cubic feet, or 16 percent, to
21.9 trillion in 2009 from 18.9 trillion in 2005, amid increased
output from wells in shale formations from Texas to
Pennsylvania, according to the department.  
 “We rely on offshore production a lot less and prices will
have a hard time getting to $6,” said  Chris Kostas , a senior
analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. “Hurricanes will only have a marginal effect.”  
 Market Speculators  
 While hurricanes are not likely to cause significant
production disruptions, traders may still buy gas on speculation
that the market will have a short-term reaction to the storms,
said  Tim Evans , an analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York.  
 “Every market every day is a function of psychology,”
Evans said. “It’s a function of what traders believe and how
they act on those beliefs, rather than on the underlying
fundamentals. In the short term, prices are driven by market
sentiment.”
