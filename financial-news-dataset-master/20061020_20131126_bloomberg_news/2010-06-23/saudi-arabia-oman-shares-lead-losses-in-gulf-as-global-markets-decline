             Saudi Arabia and Oman shares
retreated for a second day as an unexpected decline in U.S. home
sales raised concern about the stability of the global economic
recovery. Deyaar Development PJSC pushed Dubai stocks higher.  
 The  Tadawul All Share Index  dropped 0.3 percent to
6,343.47, the lowest level in more than a week, as  Samba
Financial Group,  the country’s second largest bank, fell.  Bank
Muscat SAOG , Oman’s biggest bank by assets, retreated the most
in almost three weeks, pushing the country’s  MSM30 Index  down
0.6 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  slid 0.3 percent.  
 “Correlation is running high with what’s happening
globally,” said Haissam Arabi, chief executive officer of
Gulfmena Alternative Investments in Dubai. “Investors are
trying to reduce risk ahead of a long summer.”  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets index  lost 0.6 percent at 4:43
p.m. in Dubai. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  yesterday fell
the most since June 4 after the National Association of Realtors
said purchases of existing homes dropped to a 5.66 million
annual rate. Sales were expected to rise to a 6.12 million rate,
according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  
 Samba decreased 1.7 percent, the most since June 5, to
58.75 riyals. Bank Muscat dropped 1.5 percent to 0.801 rial.  
 Dana Rises  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  gained 0.6 percent. Deyaar surged
14 percent, the most in more than six months, to 34.9 fils. The
real-estate company’s shares are down 40 percent this year.  
 Dana Gas PJSC  increased 2.9 percent to 71 fils, the highest
close this month, after the explorer and producer said its board
approved buying back as much as 10 percent of the company’s
shares and an additional budget for ventures in the United Arab
Emirates and Egypt. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  was little
changed at 2,551.39.  
 The  QE Index  in Qatar dropped 0.2 percent and the  Kuwait
Stock Exchange Index  slid 0.3 percent. Bahrain’s  measure  gained
0.5 percent to the highest since June 8.
