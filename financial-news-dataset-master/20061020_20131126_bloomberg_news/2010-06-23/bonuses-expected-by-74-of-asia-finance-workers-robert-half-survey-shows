             Seventy-four percent of banking and
financial services workers in Asia Pacific expect to be paid a
bonus this year as corporate growth prospects improve, a
recruitment company survey showed.  
 About 46 percent of the 906 workers surveyed said wages
increased in the past 12 months, even with the economic slump,
New York-listed company  Robert Half International, Inc.  said
today at a briefing in Hong Kong. The company questioned
financial professionals from across the region including
Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan.  
 The average annual base salary for employees with more than
10 years experience in corporate finance was at least HK$1.32
million ($170,000) in Hong Kong, while the comparable figure for
Singapore was S$180,000 ($130,000) plus, according to salary
tables compiled by Robert Half. Australian salaries were
A$200,000 ($174,000) or higher.  
 “The market is hot out there for talent,”  Andrew Morris ,
a director at Robert Half Hong Kong, said at the briefing. “The
term ‘war of talents’ will be back before the end of this
year.”
