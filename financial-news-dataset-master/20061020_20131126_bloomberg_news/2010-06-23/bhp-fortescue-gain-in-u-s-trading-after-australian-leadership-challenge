             BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Fortescue
Metals Group Ltd. rose in U.S. trading on optimism Australia may
change a proposed mining tax should Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd 
lose a leadership challenge from within his own party.  
 American depositary receipts in BHP, the world’s biggest
mining company, climbed 2.2 percent to $69.16. Fortescue, the
nation’s third-biggest iron ore exporter, advanced 2.1 percent.
Rudd is facing a challenge from deputy  Julia Gillard  at a ballot
at 9 a.m. Canberra time today.  
 “This leadership challenge will have the biggest
implication for the miners,”  Cameron Peacock , a market analyst
at IG Markets in Melbourne. “You’ll see the miners get a boost
today because Gillard has more scope and flexibility to move on
the resource super profits tax.”  
 Rudd has faced criticism from mining companies including
Melbourne-based BHP, London-based Rio Tinto Group and  Xstrata
Plc  over the plan to impose a 40 percent levy on mining profits
from 2012, estimated to raise A$12 billion ($10 billion) in the
first two years. Rudd said yesterday he was seeking a “sensible
and balanced” settlement with companies opposed to the tax.  
 “We would expect the mining tax to be at the forefront of
any policy revision post-government changes,”  Richard Knights ,
an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London, said in an e-
mailed note. “There is material opposition to the tax from
within Rudd’s own party.”  
 Australia, the world’s biggest shipper of coal and iron
ore, announced the new levy on May 2 as part of an overhaul that
includes a phased reduction in company tax rates to 28 percent
from 30 percent by mid-2014. The government is talking to some
80 resources companies about its plan.  
 “Rudd is seen as the driving force behind the proposed
super tax,”  Paul Cliff , an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
London, said yesterday by telephone. “Any challenge to Rudd’s
leadership would be a clear positive for the miners.”  
 Support for Rudd began to slide after he shelved the
government’s carbon-trading plans in April, a key campaign
pledge when he won office in November 2007. Dissatisfaction with
Rudd hit a record 55 percent, according to a telephone survey of
1,147 people between June 18 and June 20 published in the
 Australian  newspaper this week.

                          June 24 (Bloomberg) -- Peter Rudd, director of mining and resources at Balnave Capital, talks with Bloomberg's Judith Bogner about Julia Gillard's appointment today as Australian prime minister and its potential implications for the government's proposed tax on mining profits.
     Gillard, who was sworn in as leader after ousting Kevin Rudd, said she is willing to negotiate on the proposed tax with mining companies. BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group led gains in Australian miners after Gillard made the comments. (Source: Bloomberg)
