             HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive
Officer Michael Geoghegan said Europe will be “turbulent” as
governments scramble to improve state finances by cutting
spending.  
 “I think it’s going to be turbulent, it’s a confidence
factor,” Geoghegan told reporters in Hong Kong today. “A lot
of European governments have announced cutbacks in expenditure,
I think that’ll give markets some confidence but I think
there’ll be a lot of bumps along the way. ‘’
