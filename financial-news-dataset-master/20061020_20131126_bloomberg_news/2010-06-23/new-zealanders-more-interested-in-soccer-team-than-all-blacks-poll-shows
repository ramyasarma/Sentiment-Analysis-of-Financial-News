             More New Zealanders are interested
in the All Whites performance at the soccer World Cup than that
of the nation’s top-ranked All Blacks rugby team, according to a
poll.  
 Thirty-six percent of the 1,112 people surveyed said they
were more interested in the All Whites while 15 percent said
they followed the All Blacks more closely, UMR Research said in
an e-mailed statement today. Forty percent said they were
equally interested in both.  
 The All Whites, ranked 78th in the world by soccer’s
governing body FIFA, are playing in the finals of the World Cup
for the first time in 28 years and drew 1-1 against both
Slovakia and fifth-ranked Italy in the past week. The All Blacks
defeated Ireland 66-28 on June 12 and Wales 42-9 on June 19.  
 The poll was conducted from June 16 to June 22 and has a
margin of error of 2.9 percent. Eighty-five percent of responses
were received between the two All Whites’ matches.  
 Sixty-two percent of respondents said they were “very” or
“fairly” interested in rugby compared with 53 percent for
soccer, UMR said.
