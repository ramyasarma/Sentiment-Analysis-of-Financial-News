             Power station coal isn’t suited to
quarterly contracts and a switch to three-month pricing would be
highly “problematic” to customers, Credit Suisse Group AG
analysts said, citing a Rio Tinto Group unit executive.  
 Utilities operate in a regulated market and can’t readily
respond to rapid changes in coal pricing, Credit Suisse analysts
said in a note today, citing comments by  Bill Champion , managing
director of Coal & Allied, Rio’s Australian coal unit.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company, and
Japan’s JFE Holdings Inc. in March agreed to the first three-
month accord for coking coal used in steelmaking. Vale SA, Rio
Tinto and BHP also scrapped a 40-year custom this year of
pricing iron ore supplies in 12-month periods, replacing it with
quarterly contracts based on the average cash or spot price over
three months.  
 Thermal coal burned by power stations will remain the
dominant electricity generation fuel for the Chinese and Indian
markets, Credit Suisse analysts led by  Paul McTaggart  said,
citing Champion. India’s imports of the fuel should double in
the next five years, the analysts cited Champion as saying.  
 Credit Suisse analysts are on a five-day tour of Rio
Tinto’s Australian coal, aluminum and uranium assets, according
to the note.
