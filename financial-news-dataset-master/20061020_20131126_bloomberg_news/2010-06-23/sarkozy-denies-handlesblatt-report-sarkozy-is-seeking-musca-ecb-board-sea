             A spokesman for Nicolas Sarkozy
denied a report in Handelsblatt that the French president wants
Xavier Musca, his chief economic adviser, to join the European
Central Bank’s board when Jean-Claude Trichet steps down next
year.  
 “We totally deny” this report, Franck Louvrier told
Bloomberg today.
