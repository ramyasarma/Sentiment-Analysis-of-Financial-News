             Former Brazil cabinet chief  Dilma Rousseff  overtook rival presidential candidate  Jose Serra  in an
Ibope poll, Veja magazine  reported  today.  
 Rousseff has the support of 40 percent of those surveyed
during the past three days, compared with 35 percent for the
opposition candidate Serra, Veja reported on its website. Both
candidates had 37 percent backing in Ibope’s previous poll,
released June 5, Veja said.  
 The first round of presidential elections is scheduled for
Oct. 3. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Lula, who has endorsed
Rousseff, is barred by the Constitution from seeking a third
consecutive term.  
 Veja did not provide the poll’s margin of error.
