             Spain has decided not cut premiums 
paid for renewable energy generated at existing plants after 
lobbying by banks that have 15 billion euros ($18.4 billion) in
loans to the industry, Cinco Dias reported.   
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero decided
the cuts will only apply to future renewables projects, the 
newspaper said, citing people close to the government it didn’t
identify by name.
