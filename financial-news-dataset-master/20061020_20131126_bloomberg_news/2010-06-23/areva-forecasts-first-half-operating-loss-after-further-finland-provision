             Areva SA expects to report an
operating loss for the first half of 2010 after setting aside
another 400 million euros to cover the cost of delays on the OL3
construction project in Finland, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  
 Excluding that provision and possible costs from the
closure of an enrichment plant, the group’s operating margin for
the period should be “around 4 percent,” the company said.
First-half sales are seen rising “around 2 percent” from year-
earlier levels, Areva said.  
 First-half net income will be boosted by a 1.3 billion-euro
gain from the sale of the company’s Transmission & Distribution
business, and will show a sharp rise from year-earlier levels,
according to the statement.
