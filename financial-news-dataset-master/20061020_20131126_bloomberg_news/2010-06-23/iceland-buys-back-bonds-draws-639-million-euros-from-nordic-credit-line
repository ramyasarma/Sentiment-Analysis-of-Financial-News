             Iceland bought back bonds due in
2011 and 2012 and drew on a bilateral credit facility to boost
foreign currency reserves.  
 The Treasury repurchased 160 million euros ($196 million)
of bonds due 2011 and 32 million euros in notes due in 2012, the
central bank said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  
 Iceland has also drawn 639 million euros from a bilateral
credit line agreed with the Nordic countries and Poland, the
bank said in the same statement. The funds drawn will be used to
boost the country’s foreign currency reserves, it said.  
 The bank announced on June 16 it was inviting offers to
repurchase about 300 million euros in bonds due over the next
two years as it tries to reduce the island’s reliance on
external funding. The decision to draw on the bilateral credit
line offsets the impact of the bond repurchase on the island’s
reserves.
