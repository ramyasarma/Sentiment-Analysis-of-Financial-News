             Gold, little changed in New York,
may gain for a second day as concern that the world economic
recovery could falter spurs demand for the metal as a means to
protect wealth.  
 Asian equities  slid for a second day and European stocks
were little changed after a U.S. report yesterday showed sales
of previously owned homes unexpectedly fell. Purchases of new
houses plunged last month, analysts forecast data to show today.
Bullion climbed to a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21.  
 “The market is still jittery,” said  Bernard Sin , head of
currency and metals trading at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA in
Geneva. “Weakness in equities may continue to support gold.
Gold will continue to be bullish.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August added $3.80, or 0.3
percent, to $1,244.60 an ounce at 8:16 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Gold for immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent
higher at $1,243.88.  
 Bullion rose to $1,243 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,236 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 Investors have amassed gold as the sovereign-debt crisis in
Europe fanned demand for safer assets, prompting a 14 percent
gain in prices this year and a 16 percent increase in holdings
in the world’s biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion.
The metal is headed for a 10th consecutive annual gain, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920.  
 ‘Heavily Long’ Market  
 “Gold is still looking well bid on its unique safe-haven
status,” said  Peter Tse , head of precious metals with Bank of
Nova Scotia in Hong Kong. “However, the market is heavily long
and we could see some profit-taking,” he said, referring to
bets that prices will rise.  
 Holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest gold-backed
ETF, increased 5.17 metric tons to a record 1,313.13 tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. Global  holdings 
of the metal by ETFs rose 6.2 tons to 2,050.6 tons yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data from 10 providers.  
 “Fiat-currency concerns relating to the European
sovereign-debt crisis and excess liquidity should be positive
for gold” this year, Morgan Stanley said today in a report.
Prices may average $1,201 an ounce in 2010, up from a previous
estimate of $1,159, the bank said.  
 Silver for September delivery in New York was little
changed at $18.955 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery fell
0.6 percent to $1,593.10 an ounce. Palladium for September
delivery lost 0.2 percent to $488.95 an ounce.
