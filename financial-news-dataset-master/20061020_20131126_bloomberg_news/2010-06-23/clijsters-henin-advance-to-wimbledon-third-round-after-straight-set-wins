             Six-time champion  Roger Federer  won
in four sets to reach the third round at Wimbledon. Americans
 Andy Roddick  and  Venus Williams , both finalists last year, also
advanced today.  
 A first-round match that began yesterday between American
 John Isner  and France’s  Nicolas Mahut  will head into a third day
tomorrow after it was suspended at 9:10 p.m. tied 59-59 in the
fifth set. It already is the longest match in tennis history,
both in games and time, according to the International Tennis
Federation.  
 “This is the greatest advertisement we’ve ever had for our
sport beyond Grand Slam finals,” three-time Wimbledon champion
 John McEnroe  told the British Broadcasting Corp. after darkness
caused the suspension following 10 hours of play.  
 Switzerland’s Federer, the top seed, who is bidding to tie
 Pete Sampras ’s Open-era men’s record of seven titles at
Wimbledon, beat Serbia’s Ilija Bozoljac 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 7-6
(7-5).  
 Roddick, three times beaten by Federer in the final,
defeated France’s  Michael Llodra  4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (7-2). He
was followed on Centre Court by five-time women’s champion and
No. 2 seed Williams, who beat Russia’s  Ekaterina Makarova  6-0,
6-4.  
 “I was pleased to get a good start and to close it out in
the end,” Williams told reporters. “On grass, my serve is
obviously important.”  
 Former top-ranked players  Kim Clijsters  and  Justine Henin 
of Belgium, who retired from the sport before making comebacks
in 2009 and 2010, also progressed in the women’s draw. Neither
has won the title at the All England Club.  
 Federer, who had to come from two sets down in his first-
round match, again struggled against a lower-ranked opponent --
No. 152 Bozoljac. The Swiss is aiming to maintain his record of
reaching every final at the All England Club since 2003, losing
the championship match only once, to  Rafael Nadal  in 2008.  
 Roddick Loses Set  
 Roddick, 27, dropped the first set against Llodra today and
struggled with his serve at the start of the second set before
recovering.  
 “He’s a very dangerous opponent,” the American said in a
televised interview after the match. “He played pretty flawless
for the better part of two sets.”  
 No. 3 seed  Novak Djokovic  of Serbia beat  Taylor Dent  of the
U.S. 7-6 (7-5), 6-1, 6-4.  
 No. 15  Lleyton Hewitt  of Australia, the 2002 winner,
advanced when Kazakhstan’s  Evgeny Korolev  quit their match in
the third set. Seeded players  Gael Monfils  of France,  Feliciano Lopez  of Spain,  Tomas Berdych  of the Czech Republic and  Jurgen Melzer  of Austria also won. No. 7 seed  Nikolay Davydenko  of
Russia lost to Germany’s Daniel Brands.  
 Isner and Mahut have been playing for 10 hours. The match,
suspended at 6-4, 3-6, 6-7 (7-9), 7-6 (7-3), 59-59, was stopped
after Mahut said he was struggling to see the ball in fading
light in southwest London.  
 Match Not Over  
 “Someone has to win, we’ll have to come back and see who
will win,” Mahut said.  
 Before today, the longest tennis match had been a six-hour,
33-minute first-round contest at the 2004 French Open between
Frenchmen  Fabrice Santoro  and  Arnaud Clement .  
 The 30-year-old Williams completed her victory in 1 hour, 5
minutes as Makarova struggled to repeat her success on grass
last week at Eastbourne, where she won her first WTA Tour title.  
 Williams has won the title at the All England Club in 2000,
2001, 2005, 2007 and 2008, and has lost in the final three
times.  
 Clijsters, playing at Wimbledon for the first time since
2006, beat Croatia’s  Karolina Sprem  6-3, 6-2. Henin, a
semifinalist in her most recent appearance in 2007, defeated
Germany’s  Kristina Barrois  6-3, 7-5.  
 The 27-year-old Clijsters, who won the U.S. Open title for
the second time in only the third tournament of her return last
year, took her career record against Sprem, of Croatia, to 5-0.  
 “I feel that I’m definitely playing probably my best
tennis that I’ve played on grass, compared to even a few years
ago,” Clijsters told reporters. “I think that’s a good feeling
to have.”  
 Clijsters, with 37 career titles, completed the win on her
third match point. Her best performance at the only grass-court
Grand Slam was reaching the semifinals in 2003 and 2006.  
 Henin Struggles, Wins  
 Henin, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, struggled to close
out her match against Barrois after leading 5-2 in the second
set. She lost two successive service games before breaking back
in the 11th game, then holding serve to secure a third-round
spot.  
 Melanie Oudin  of the U.S, seeded 33rd,  Shahar Peer , the No.
13 seed from Israel, and No. 30  Yaroslava Shvedova  of Kazakhstan
all lost. No. 4 seed  Jelena Jankovic  of Serbia defeated
Canada’s  Aleksandra Wozniak  4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
