             Multi Commodity Exchange of India
Ltd., the nation’s largest such bourse, got permission from the
industry regulator to sell shares in an initial public offering.  
 The  exchange  has been exempted from selling a 10 percent
stake to state-run companies after failing to find a buyer for
the holding,  B.C. Khatua , chairman of the Forward Markets
Commission, the regulator, said in a phone interview.  
 The regulator last month gave conditional approval for the
initial sale. The exchange, the world’s sixth-largest commodity
futures bourse by volume, offered to sell a 10 percent stake at
a minimum price of 563 rupees share, Edelweiss Capital Ltd. said
in a May 17 newspaper advertisement.  
 “We wanted certain types of investors to have a stake in
the exchange,” Khatua said. “They made an open offer for that.
Since there are no takers for that, we had to give them an
exemption from that condition.”  
 MCX must secure approval from the Securities Exchange Board
of India, Khatua said.  
 Suman Das Sarma , vice president of communication for the
exchange, declined to comment.  
 MCX, as the exchange is known, scrapped plans for a share
sale in August 2008 after the stock market slumped. The exchange
is promoted by  Financial Technologies (India) Ltd.  and Fidelity
International Ltd., NYSE Euronext and Bank of America Merrill
Lynch are among holders in the bourse.
