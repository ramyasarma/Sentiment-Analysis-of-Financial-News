             The International Energy Agency , an
adviser to oil-consuming nations, said growth in world fuel
demand will decline over the next five years as the pace of
Chinese consumption slows.  
 The IEA estimates that annual demand growth will shrink
every year to average 1 percent in 2015, or 940,000 barrels a
day, from 1.9 percent, or 1.62 million barrels a day, in 2010,
it said in its Medium-Term Oil and Gas Markets 2010 report
today. Total consumption will be 91.93 million barrels a day in
five years compared with 86.39 million barrels a day this year,
according to the Paris-based agency.  
 “Oil and gas markets are starting to show signs of
recovery, but the impact of the recession differs across regions
and the outlook remains very uncertain,”  Nobuo Tanaka ,
executive director of the IEA, said in Paris today. “The
projected growth in demand is not set in stone.”  
 The world is relying on consumers in China and the Middle
East to keep spending and maintain the global economic recovery
as the developed economies of the U.S. and Europe stagnate. The
IEA sees consumption from emerging economies outside the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development accounting
for 52 percent of the world’s oil use by 2015, compared with 47
percent this year.  
 Oil prices are 13 percent higher than a year ago, trading
at about $77 a barrel in New York today, as confidence grows
that fuel demand will rise as the world emerges from recession.
Prices could fluctuate more aggressively in the future as rising
demand cuts unused production, according to the agency.  
 Capacity Shrinks  
 Spare production capacity in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will start shrinking in 2011, the IEA said.
OPEC spare capacity will average 3.6 million barrels a day in
2015 compared with 5.83 million barrels a day this year,
according to the report.  
 “We see spare capacity diminishing after 2012,”  David Fyfe , head of the IEA’s oil industry and markets unit, said in
Paris. “This could point to more nervous, jittery markets after
2012.”  
 The  BP Plc  oil rig accident in the Gulf of Mexico, which
could have been avoided, may lead to delays in drillings of two
years and curb output by as much as 300,000 barrels a day,
Tanaka said.  
 The worst oil spill in U.S. history “is a catastrophe that
could have been avoided,” he said. “Its an accumulation of
human errors.” Tanaka called for “balanced” policy measures
in the aftermath of the rig fire and explosion.  
 Oil Demand  
 The IEA’s 2014 world oil demand estimate is 130,000 barrels
a day higher than its forecast in last year’s medium-term market
report. The estimate reflects a “higher GDP scenario” based on
the International Monetary Fund’s forecasts for 4.5 percent
annual global economic growth from 2010 onwards, it said.  
 While Chinese oil demand is expected to reach 11.63 million
barrels a day by 2015, from 9.16 million barrels a day this
year, the pace of annual growth is slowing, according to the IEA
data. Consumption will increase 4.1 percent in 2015, compared
with 7.6 percent this year, the data show.  
 The rate of decline in developed economies is accelerating.
North American demand will drop 0.6 percent in 2015 compared
with a rise of 0.8 percent this year, according to the IEA.
Total demand from OECD countries will drop 0.9 percent compared
with 0.1 percent in 2010, the agency estimates.  
 Non-OECD Demand  
 “Non-OECD countries will drive global oil demand growth
while consumption will decline in the OECD,” the IEA report
showed. “Growth in transportation fuel demand in the OECD will
be modest and insufficient to offset the structural decline in
both burning and industrial fuels.”  
 The biggest change compared with last year’s report was to
the IEA’s forecast for supply from outside OPEC.  
 The agency estimates that non-OPEC oil supply will average
52.5 million barrels a day in 2015 compared with 51.5 million
barrels a day in 2009, six-year growth of 1.9 percent. In last
year’s report it estimated that supply would decline 0.4 percent
in the six years through 2014.  
 “Higher prices, lower costs and fledgling signs of
increased upstream spending have eased some of last year’s
concerns about medium-term oil supply prospects,” according to
the report. “Latin America, the Canadian oil sands, the Caspian
region and biofuels generate most of the growth, offsetting
continued decline from the North Sea, the U.S. and Mexico.”
