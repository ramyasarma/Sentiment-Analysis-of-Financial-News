             Cotton prices fell the most in more
than two weeks after new-home sales in the U.S. slumped, eroding
confidence in the economic recovery and lowering the outlook for
textile demand. Orange-juice futures rose.  
 Purchases of new homes dropped in May to a record low as a
tax credit expired, indicating that the market remains dependent
on government support. Cotton fell for the first time this week
after advancing 0.3 percent in the previous two sessions. The
fiber has climbed 3.4 percent this year.  
 “Cotton is particularly sensitive to outside economic
data, and the new-home sales number was frighteningly bad,”
said  Sterling Smith , an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in St.
Paul, Minnesota. “If we’re not seeing people buying houses,
that extrapolates all the way through the economy, which means
less spending on clothing items, which can weigh on the cotton
market.”  
 Cotton for December delivery fell 1.05 cents, or 1.3
percent, to 78.16 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York
in the biggest drop since June 4. Earlier, prices slumped to
77.48 cents, the lowest level for a most-active contract since
June 10.  
 The cotton market has “established pretty good
resistance” at 80 cents and will probably need some sort of
outside news to push prices higher, Smith said.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.25 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to $1.4235 a pound in New York. The commodity
has jumped 10 percent this year.
