             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  declined 299.60, or 1.1 percent, to 27,617.91, the
biggest retreat since June 7.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, dropped 3.34 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 219.21 rand.
 Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ) retreated 5.37 rand, or 1.8 percent,
to 295.33. Copper fell for the first time in three days after
new-home purchases in the U.S. decreased to a record low,
signaling further economic weakening in the world’s second-
biggest consumer of the metal.  
 Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.  (IMP SJ), the world’s second-
largest platinum producer, slumped for a second day, losing 4.70
rand, or 2.4 percent, to 191.04 rand. The price of the precious
metal decreased in London trading.  
 Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd.  (MUR SJ) fell 1.70 rand, or
4.1 percent, to 39.70 rand, the biggest drop since May 7. The
construction company said annual profit will decline by as much
as 55 percent because of higher-than-expected costs associated
with the Gautrain high-speed rail project.  
 Rolfes Technology Holdings Ltd.  (RLF SJ) rallied 20 cents,
or 20 percent, to 1.20 rand, the biggest gain in almost eight
months. The maker of pigments used in plastics and resins said
earnings per share in the 12 months through June at least
doubled compared with the year-earlier period.  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, dropped 3.01 rand, or 1 percent, to 287.49 rand,
extending yesterday’s 1.9 percent slide. Crude oil declined the
most in more than two weeks after an industry report showed that
supplies rose in the U.S., the world’s largest energy-consuming
country.
