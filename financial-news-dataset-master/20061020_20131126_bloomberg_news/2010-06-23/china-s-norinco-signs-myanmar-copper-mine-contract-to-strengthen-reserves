             China North Industries Corp. , a
Beijing-based engineering and defense company, signed a copper
mining contract in Myanmar that it said will strengthen China’s
strategic reserves of the metal.  
 The Chinese company, also known as Norinco, made the
agreement during a visit to Myanmar by Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  and Norinco Chairman Zhang Guoqing, the company said in a
 statement  dated June 10 posted on its  website . Financial terms
of the mining contract weren’t disclosed.  
 China, the world’s largest metals consumer, this week
indicated it will abandon the two-year-old dollar peg of its
currency, the yuan. A rising Chinese currency may boost China’s
purchasing power and increase imports.  
 Norinco also signed cooperation agreements in Myanmar, the
country formerly known as Burma, related to chemical production-
line renovations and port, wharf, rail and hydropower projects,
according to the statement. Norinco’s mine contract was reported
earlier by the Wall Street Journal.
