             Italian consumer confidence  fell in
June to the lowest in 16 months as households grew pessimistic
about the jobs outlook amid a fragile economic recovery.  
 The  Isae Institute’s  consumer confidence index fell to
104.4 from 105.4 in May, the Rome-based research center said
today in an e-mailed statement. Economists had forecast a
reading of 105, according to the  median of 13 estimates  in a
Bloomberg News survey. The June reading is the lowest since
February 2009.  
 Italy’s  unemployment rate  rose in April to the highest
since the third quarter of 2001 as businesses remained cautious
about the recovery and reluctant to hire. The euro region’s
third-biggest  economy  expanded less than originally forecast in
the first quarter as weaker domestic demand more than offset
limited gains in exports helped by the slumping euro.  
 Last month, Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s government
proposed deficit cuts of 24.9 billion euros ($30.6 billion) as
part of a European effort to shore up confidence in the euro
region amid the sovereign-debt crisis originated in Greece.  
 The economic “recovery is under way and it’s
psychological. People need to have confidence,” Berlusconi said
on June 16, speaking at the annual meeting of the country’s
biggest retailers’ lobby, Confcommercio.  
 The drop in confidence was “mainly due to a worsening” in
Italians’ personal economic outlook, Isae said. “Expectations
for the country’s economic situation were unchanged.”  
 Isae conducted its survey between June 1 and June 16.
