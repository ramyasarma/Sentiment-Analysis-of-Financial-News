             Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of
Sumitomo Chemical Co. and the new chairman of the Japan Business
Federation, or Nippon Keidanren, criticized a new requirement
that companies disclose executive pay over 100 million yen
($1.11 million), Nikkei English News reported.  
 He said pay disclosure rules in the U.S. had done little to
corral compensation or improve governance, and said Japan’s
threshold should be higher, Nikkei reported.
