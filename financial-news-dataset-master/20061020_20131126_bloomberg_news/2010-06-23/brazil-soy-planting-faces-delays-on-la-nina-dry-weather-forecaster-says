             Soybean planting in Brazil, the
world’s second-largest producer of the oilseed, may be delayed
by dry weather caused by the La Nina weather pattern, a
forecaster said.  
 “The La Nina years are among the worst for grain and
oilseed crops in Brazil,”  Paulo Etchichury , head of Sao Paulo-
based forecaster  Somar Meteorologia , said today in a telephone
interview.  
 La Nina is caused by cooling temperatures in the Pacific
Ocean. The pattern can trigger worldwide changes in weather,
including more hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and below-
average rains in the South of Brazil during the soybean planting
season that runs from September to November.  
 Soybean output in Brazil rose 20 percent from a year
earlier to 68.7 million metric tons during the crop that farmers
finished harvesting last month, according to the Agriculture
Ministry. Southern Brazil accounted for 37 percent of total
production, according to the government’s forecasting agency,
known as Conab.  
 The U.S. is the world’s biggest producer of soybeans.
