             India’s stocks fell for a second day
as investors sold riskier assets after an unexpected drop in U.S.
home sales fanned concern about the strength of the global
economic recovery.  
 DLF Ltd. , a developer, lost the most in two weeks.  Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. , an engineering company, dropped 2.3 percent,
retreating for a second day from its highest level in two years.
Existing U.S. house purchases fell in May by the most in 16
years after a tax credit expired.  Paul Krugman , the Nobel Prize-
winning economist, said the global economy needs more stimulus
at a time when governments are concerned with mounting debt.  
 “The global concerns are not going to be addressed
overnight,” said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, chief strategist at
SMC Capitals Ltd. in New Delhi. “There is no real conviction
and confidence among investors to put in more money at higher
levels.” He declined to name specific stocks.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 66.44, or 0.4 percent, to 17,683.25 at 10:29 a.m. in Mumbai,
its second day of losses from a two-month high. The S&P CNX
 Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost 0.3 percent to
5,302.85. The  BSE 200 Index  was little changed at 2,237.91.  
 DLF, Larsen  
 DLF retreated 1 percent to 285.35 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro ,
India’s biggest engineering company, lost 2.3 percent to 1,784
rupees. The stock, which climbed 13 percent this month through
June 21, is trading at more than 29 times estimated profit,
compared with the Sensex index’s 17.2 multiple.  
 India’s benchmark is the most expensive among the four BRIC
markets, which also include China, Brazil and Russia.  
 Overseas  investors  bought a net  18 billion rupees  ($394
million) of Indian equities on June 21, taking their total
purchases of the stocks this year to 280 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.
