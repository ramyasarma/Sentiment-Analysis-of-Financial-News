             Copper and zinc dropped in Shanghai
after China said it will remove export-tax rebates on some
products, stoking concern that a domestic supply glut will form.  
 Copper for September delivery in Shanghai fell as much as 1
percent to 52,340 yuan ($7,680) a ton and traded at 52,460 yuan
at 9:21 a.m. local time. Zinc slumped as much as 2 percent to
14,515 yuan a ton and last traded at 14,625 yuan.  
 Rebates on some copper, zinc, lead, nickel and tin products
such as tubes and wires will be removed from July 15, the
Ministry of Finance said in a  statement  yesterday on its website.
The tariff change, announced amid increasing trade complaints
from the U.S. and the European Union, will also affect steel
products, of which China is the largest producer.  
 “The rebate removal puts immediate pressure on Chinese
prices,” Xiao Jing, an analyst at Beijing Capital Futures Co.,
said today. Copper and zinc may be the most prone to the
negative impact as exports of the metals products just started
to recover, she said.  
 Three-month delivery copper dropped as much as 1.1 percent
to $6,538 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, before trading at
$6,556.  
 U.S. sales previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in May
as demand began to slip even before a government tax credit
expires, figures from the National Association of Realtors
showed yesterday in Washington. The U.S. is the second-biggest
copper user.  
 Aluminum in London retreated 0.2 percent to $1,955 a ton,
zinc lost 0.8 percent to $1,779 a ton, lead declined 1 percent
to $1,810. Nickel and tin were yet to trade as of 9:21 a.m. in
Shanghai.
