             Kenneth Feinberg , the Obama
administration’s special master on executive compensation, will
step down from the post by the end of August, a Treasury
Department spokesman said.  
 Feinberg will leave to focus on his job as government-
appointed administrator of BP Plc’s $20 billion fund to pay
claims stemming from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Treasury
spokesman  Andrew Williams  said today.  
 Under an agreement with the White House June 16, BP agreed
to set up the escrow fund over a four-year period to pay claims
and said it will contribute $100 million to support jobless oil
rig workers.  
 While emergency payments will be made to oil-spill
claimants without a requirement to give up the right to sue,
Feinberg will establish a system for compensating victims for
the longer term as an alternative to litigation.  
 Feinberg, speaking June 21 on CNN, said he hopes to
replicate his record in administering a similar fund for
families of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
by persuading claimants to accept compensation from the
fund.  
 Since being appointed to the compensation post by President
 Barack Obama  a year ago, Feinberg has scrutinized the pay of
employees at seven companies that received taxpayer-funded
bailouts, including Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. He
is wrapping up an analysis of employees at dozens of firms
covering a four-month period of 2008 and 2009.  
 Pay Office  
 Feinberg, 64, has “built up an office” that can continue
working on pay issues, Williams said.  
 Feinberg has sought data from companies including  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that received aid under
the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. The review,
required by law to determine whether any payments were
inappropriate, covers employees earning more than $500,000 a
year.  
 His request covered the period from October 2008, when
bailout money was first awarded, to February 2009, when Obama
signed economic stimulus legislation that included executive-pay
curbs. Feinberg may use publicity to pressure executives to
return compensation even if he doesn’t have the legal authority
to recoup the money.  
 Feinberg may release his findings on the pay issue next
month, Williams said.  
 In March, Feinberg told the five companies whose pay he
supervises to cut cash compensation 33 percent from last year.
Total pay in 2010, including cash, will fall by about 15 percent
for the 119 highest-paid executives at  American International
Group Inc. , General Motors Co., GMAC Inc., Chrysler Group LLC
and Chrysler Financial Corp. Compensation at Citigroup and Bank
of America was under Feinberg’s oversight until they repaid
taxpayer funds in December.
