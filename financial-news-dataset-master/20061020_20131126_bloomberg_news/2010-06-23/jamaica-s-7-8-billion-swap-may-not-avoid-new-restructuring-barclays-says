             Jamaica may need to restructure its
debt again to avoid default, Barclays Capital said.  
 The Caribbean country’s debt load remains high, at
126 percent of gross domestic product last year, after it
swapped $7.8 billion of local bonds for securities with longer
maturities and lower interest rates in February, said  Alejandro Grisanti , an analyst at Barclays Plc in New York.  
 “Jamaica is still on a non-sustainable fiscal path and
will need to restructure its debt sometime in the future,”
Grisanti wrote in a report to clients today.  
 The capture of accused drug lord Christopher “Dudus” Coke
won’t solve the gang violence that is harming tourism and
draining revenue from the budget, he said in a phone interview.
