             Gunmen in Sudan’s western region of
Darfur kidnapped two German aid workers and their Sudanese
security guard yesterday, a United Nations spokesman said.  
 The aid workers are employed by  Technisches Hilfswerk , a
German non-governmental organization,  Kemal Saiki , the director
of communications for the  UN-African Union peacekeeping mission 
in Darfur, said by phone today from the force’s headquarters in
El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state.  
 The kidnapping was carried out by seven gunmen wearing
civilian clothes between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. local time in Nyala,
capital of South Darfur state, Saiki said. The driver was
released soon after the abduction, he said.  
 “We don’t know who these people are or what are their
motives,” Saiki said.  
 Darfur has been the scene of conflict between the
government and rebel groups since 2003. As many as 300,000
people have died, mainly due to illness and starvation,
according to UN estimates. Sudanese President  Umar al-Bashir ’s
government puts the death toll at about 10,000.
