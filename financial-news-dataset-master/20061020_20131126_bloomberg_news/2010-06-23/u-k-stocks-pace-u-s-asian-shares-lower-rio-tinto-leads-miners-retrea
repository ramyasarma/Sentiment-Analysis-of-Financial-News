             U.K. stocks dropped for a second
day, led by a sell-off in commodity producers after new home
sales in the U.S. dropped to a record low, reigniting concern
about the recovery in the world’s largest economy.  
 Xstrata Plc, the fourth-largest copper producer, and Anglo
American Plc sank more than 2 percent as base metals retreated
in London. Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd. fell more than
1 percent after earlier reversing losses as Australian Prime
Minister  Kevin Rudd  said he faces a leadership challenge.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  fell 68.46, or 1.3 percent, to
5,178.52 in London, as the gauge extended its retreat from a
one-month high reached on June 21. The  FTSE All-Share Index 
declined 1.2 percent, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  fell 2.4
percent.  
 “This afternoon’s disappointing U.S. housing data provoked
fear over the sustainability of the global recovery which leads
to demand concerns that have destabilised the resources
sector,” said London-based  Anthony Grech , head of research at
IG Index.  
 U.S. stocks yesterday tumbled by the most in almost three
weeks after existing home sales unexpectedly dropped. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index extended losses today after
purchases of new homes in the U.S. fell in May as a tax credit
expired, showing the market remains dependent on government
support.  
 Metals Decline  
 Xstrata , the world’s fourth-largest copper producer, fell
2.9 percent to 1,018 pence as copper, nickel lead and tin
declined on the London Metal Exchange. Anglo American dropped
2.3 percent to 2,621 pence and Lonmin Plc lost 3.2 percent to
1,637 pence.  
 Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company, slid
1.6 percent to 3,390 pence and BHP, the world’s biggest,
declined 1.9 percent to 1,951 pence. Both shares earlier rallied
more than 1 percent after Prime Minister Rudd, who has proposed
a new profits tax on mining companies,  told reporters in
Canberra that he faced a challenge from deputy  Julia Gillard  at
a ballot tomorrow.  
 Rudd has faced criticism from metal producers over the plan
to impose a 40 percent levy on mining profits from 2012,
estimated to raise A$12 billion ($10 billion) in the first two
years.  
 Bank Levy  
 Barclays Plc dropped 3.2 percent to 300.8 pence as analysts
at Redburn Partners LLP said the lender would be the worst
affected from Britain’s new bank levy.  
 Lloyds banking Group Plc. which is 41 percent British
government-owned, may see a 3 percent rise in its earnings per
share in 2012, as corporation tax begins falling to 24 percent
from 28 percent over four years, Redburn analyst Jon Kirk wrote
in a note to investors. In contrast, Barclays will lose 4
percent of earnings a share, the report said.  
 Lloyds slid 0.5 percent to 58.7 pence after earlier
rallying as much as 4.8 percent.  
 Kesa Electricals Plc  gained 1.9 percent to 119.6 pence
after the U.K.-based operator of Comet and Darty electronics
stores swung to a full-year profit as it increased sales in
France.  
 Net income was 40.7 million pounds ($60 million) in the
year ended April 30, compared with a loss of 111.4 million
pounds last year.
