             Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s largest maker of luxury cars, has sold out of the
revamped 5-Series sedan in all markets, forcing customers to
wait three to four months for deliveries.  
 “The 5-Series is at the core of the BMW brand and we knew
it was going to be a very strong vehicle for us,”  Ian Robertson , BMW’s sales chief, said today in an interview at an
industry conference in Bilbao, Spain. “In the U.S., where it’s
doing very well, it could come to between 15 percent and 17
percent of our business as we ramp up.”  
 The new 5-Series, which abandoned the flared headlights and
small kidney-shaped grill of the previous version, starts at
$44,550 in the U.S. The vehicle went on sale in the U.S. this
week and in Europe in late March.  
 BMW ’s flagship model competes with Daimler AG’s Mercedes E-
Class and Volkswagen AG’s Audi A6. Audi, which aims to overtake
BMW by 2015, plans to introduce a new version of the A6 next
year, which will test the strength of the demand for the 5-
Series, analyst  Georg Stuerzer  said.  
 “The 5-Series is likely taking market share from the A6,
because it’s in the last year of its lifecycle,” said Stuerzer
with UniCredit in Munich, who recommends buying the shares.
“BMW’s new design language is more appealing and less
controversial than in the past.”  
 BMW  fell 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, to 41.49 euros in
Frankfurt. The stock has gained 30 percent this year, valuing
the Munich-based carmaker at 26.5 billion euros ($33 billion).  
 Increasing Profitability  
 BMW aims to raise profitability by increasing parts sharing
among vehicles as Mercedes-Benz and Audi step up efforts to take
market share. The new 5-Series shares as much as 70 percent of
its technology with the top-of-the-line 7-Series, which starts
at $70,150.  
 Demand for luxury vehicles has rebounded after the
financial crisis sapped sales last year. BMW’s sales rose 11
percent in May, buoyed by deliveries of the 5-Series, 7-Series
and Z4 roadster. Mercedes sales climbed 17 percent as E-Class
demand surged 84 percent, while  Audi  deliveries advanced 15
percent.  
 “The 5-Series has a lot of momentum and will likely have
its full impact in 2011,” Stuerzer said.  
 Second-quarter sales of the manufacturers’ BMW, Mini, and
Rolls-Royce vehicles are in line with the 14 percent gain in the
first quarter, Robertson said today.  
 BMW  is sticking to its target of increasing vehicle sales
by a high single-digit percentage, Robertson said. The company
said in May that it intends to deliver at least 1.3 million cars
and sport-utility vehicles this year after selling 1.29 million
in 2009, its lowest full-year deliveries since 2004. BMW’s sales
through May gained 13 percent to 552,864 vehicles.  
 “A lot of markets are performing well,” Robertson said.
“Overall we’re seeing good progress.”
