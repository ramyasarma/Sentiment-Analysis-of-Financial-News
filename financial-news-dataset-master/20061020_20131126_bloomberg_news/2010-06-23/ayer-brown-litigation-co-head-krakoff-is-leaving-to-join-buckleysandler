             BuckleySandler LLP , a 90-attorney
law firm in Washington, hired  David S. Krakoff , the former co-
leader of the litigation practice at  Mayer Brown LLP .  
 Krakoff and another former  Mayer Brown  partner,  Christopher Regan , are joining as partners and will specialize in financial-
services enforcement, BuckleySandler said today in a statement.  
 “From the day we started the new firm in March 2009, our
intention was to have a full-service financial-services
boutique,”  Andrew Sandler , BuckleySandler’s co-chairman, said
in a telephone interview. “This completes the enforcement side
of our practice.”  
 BuckleySandler was formed by the merger of Buckley Kolar
LLP and a group of 15 lawyers led by Sandler, a former partner
at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.  
 The firm has almost doubled in size since then. In June
2009, it hired the former general counsel of  General Electric
Co. ’s GE Money Americas unit, and in February it brought on the
former co-head of the government enforcement practice group at
Ropes & Gray LLP.  
 BuckleySandler handles commercial litigation, regulatory
and enforcement work for banks, credit-card companies, mortgage
issuers and mortgage servicers. Clients include Wells Fargo &
Co., Citigroup Inc. and American Express Co., Sandler said.  
 “We thank them for their contribution to the firm and wish
them well,” a Mayer Brown spokeswoman, Aimee Jasculca, said in
an e-mailed statement.
