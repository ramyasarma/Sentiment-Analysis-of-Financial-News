             Hong Kong home rental rates rose 32
percent in the 14 months ended in May as the economy stabilized,
and they’re forecast to keep advancing, according to a report
from Centaline Property Agency Ltd.  
 Rental rates climbed to HK$17.40 ($2.24) per square foot in
May, rebounding from a low of HK$13.20 in March 2009, as an
improvement in investor sentiment helped lift the property
market,  Wong Leung-sing , associate director at Centaline wrote
in a  research note .  
 Low interest rates could continue to bolster the market,
Wong said in the report released yesterday.  
 Home prices have risen 41 percent since the end of 2008,
prompting the government to tighten down-payment requirements
for luxury homes in October to curb speculation. Financial
Secretary John Tsang on May 12 pledged to keep boosting land
supply.
