             SAIC Motor Corp ., China’s largest
domestic automaker, plans to raise almost 10 billion yuan ($1.5
billion) in a sale of new shares,  21st Century Business Herald 
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  
 SAIC will use the funds to develop its own brands and
alternative-energy vehicles, the report said.  Zhu Xiangjun , a
spokeswoman for SAIC, declined to comment on the report, saying
the company plans to make an announcement by June 25.  
 Trading in the Shanghai-listed shares of SAIC, the Chinese
partner of General Motors Co. and  Volkswagen AG , has been
suspended since June 21 pending an announcement about a share
placement to be reviewed by its board within a week. Chinese
automakers including SAIC are introducing their own brands and
technologies to compete with global rivals.  
 SAIC re-branded Rover cars in China as Roewe after it took
over the design rights in 2005. It plans to start making MG-
brand cars at its plant in the U.K. by the end of this year, Zhu
said in January.  
 The Shanghai-based company aims to sell more than 3 million
vehicles this year and  boost  revenue to 245 billion yuan from
140 billion yuan in 2009, according to a filing to the Shanghai
stock exchange on April 1. SAIC’s May sales rose 26 percent from
a year earlier to 289,239 vehicles, the automaker said on June 7.  
 Most of SAIC’s vehicles are made with its partners GM and
Volkswagen. The company aims to sell 180,000 own-brand vehicles
this year, President  Chen Hong  said in March.
