             A small plane crashed shortly after
takeoff from the Quebec City airport today, killing all seven
people on board, a spokeswoman for the airport said.  
 The twin-engine Beechcraft King Air turboprop, operated by
closely held  Aeropro , was on its way to Sept-Iles, Quebec, when
it crashed into a backyard, airport spokeswoman Julianne Viens
said in an interview. The aircraft was carrying two crew members
and five passengers, Viens said. She didn’t have the names of
the people on board.  
 Police got a call about the crash around 6 a.m., according
to a recorded message on the Quebec City police media line.  
 Founded in 1988, Aeropro runs business and recreational
charter flights and has about 250 employees, according to its
website. The company is based at Quebec City’s Jean Lesage
International Airport. Last month, four people died when an
Aeropro-owned Cessna crashed on Quebec’s Ile-aux-Grues.
