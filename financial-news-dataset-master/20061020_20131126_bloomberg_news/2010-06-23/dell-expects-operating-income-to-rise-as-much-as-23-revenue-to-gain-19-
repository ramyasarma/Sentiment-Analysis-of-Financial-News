             Dell Inc. , the world’s third-largest
personal-computer maker, expects fiscal 2011 operating income,
excluding some costs, to rise as much as 23 percent this year,
returning to growth after a two-year slump.  
 Dell said in a statement that revenue will rise as much as
19 percent from the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, when sales fell
13.4% to $52.9 billion. Dell’s sales were little changed in its
2009 fiscal year.  
 The company is trying to lessen its dependence on PCs,
moving into technology services and smartphones and releasing a
tablet computer. Round Rock, Texas-based Dell, more than three
years into a turnaround effort, has announced plans to cut more
than 10,000 jobs and outsourced production, shutting factories
to save money.  
 “The first reaction is, ‘Wow, Dell’s giving guidance.’
It’s the first time in years,” said  Jayson Noland , a senior
analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in San Francisco, who has an
“outperform” rating on Dell shares. The company had quit
offering forecasts during its turnaround. “I don’t think it
does a whole lot for the stock,” he said. “They’re being
conservative.”  
 Dell rose 2 cents to $13.82 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading.  The shares  were little changed in late trading, after
the company announced its forecast.  
 Dell said in the statement that it “expects solid growth
for the year driven by the refresh of PCs in commercial and
public segments coupled with the company’s expanding abilities
to provide open, capable and affordable enterprise solutions.”  
 Revenue Growth  
 “Commercial refresh and the client volume we’re seeing
there is driving the revenue growth for the company,” Chief
Financial Officer  Brian Gladden  said at a Dell reception for
analysts in Austin, Texas.  
 The company bought Perot Systems for $3.6 billion last year
to expand into computing services, and it acquired storage maker
EqualLogic for $1.4 billion in 2007. It had $10.9 billion in
cash and short-term investments on its  balance sheet  at the end
of the first quarter on April 30.  
 Abhey Lamba , an analyst at ISI Group Inc. in New York, said
Dell is reiterating other technology vendors’ bullish outlook on
PC sales as companies replace aging models.  
 Seeking Excitement  
 “Dell needs to do three things to become exciting: reduce
their reliance on PCs, increase profitability in their consumer
business and increase their emerging-market footprint,” said
Lamba, who has a “hold” rating on the shares.  
 Dell is facing tough competition from International
Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., which are ahead
in profitable technology services. In its first quarter,  Dell’s
sales  increased 21 percent to $14.9 billion. Net income rose 18
percent to $341 million, or 30 cents a share.  
 Even after its Perot Systems purchase, services account for
just 13 percent of Dell’s sales. About 55 percent of Dell’s
revenue in the first quarter came from desktop and mobile PCs,
whose average sales have fallen the past two years, according to
 Bloomberg data .  
 Services revenue has increased an average of 2.9 percent in
the company’s two most recent fiscal years, while sales of PCs,
laptops, servers, storage devices and software have declined.
