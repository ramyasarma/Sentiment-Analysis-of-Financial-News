             Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA,
Portugal’s biggest toll-road operator, said it agreed to sell a
6 percent stake in Brazilian highway operator Companhia de
Concessoes Rodoviarias for about 990 million reais to cut debt.  
 The holding will be sold to existing CCR shareholders
Andrade Gutierrez Concessoes SA, Camargo Correa Investimentos em
Infra-Estrutura SA and Soares Penido Concessoes SA, Brisa said
in a regulatory filing.  
 Brisa said it will also be free to sell the remaining 10.35
percent stake it holds in CCR through a private placement that
is due to be carried out by Banco Santander SA in the next few
weeks. Brisa estimates the total capital gain from the sale of
the 16.35 percent stake in CCR at about 750 million euros,
according to a presentation on the company’s website.
