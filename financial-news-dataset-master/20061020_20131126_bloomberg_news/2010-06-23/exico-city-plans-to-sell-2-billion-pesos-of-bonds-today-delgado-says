             Mexico City will sell 2 billion
pesos ($158 million) of bonds today to finance the expansion of
its metro system, the capital’s Finance  Minister Mario Delgado 
said.  
 The city will auction 1 billion pesos of 10-year fixed-rate
bonds and 1 billion pesos of five-year notes tied to the 28-day
 TIIE  interbank lending rate, Delgado said in an interview in
Mexico City.  
 Mexico City, which may sell as much as 5 billion pesos of
bonds this year, will use the government’s 8 percent notes due
in 2020 as a reference, Delgado said. The yield on the
securities has fallen 69 basis points since the note was issued
in February to 6.97 percent as slowing inflation fuels demand
from pension funds. A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.  
 “This is a good moment for us to sell,” he said. “The
market has improved from last year and we are seeing demand from
pension funds, investment banks and other sources.”
