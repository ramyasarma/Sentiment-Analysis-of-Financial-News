             India’s central bank may raise
interest rates “anytime” after inflation unexpectedly
accelerated last month, said Pronab Sen, the government’s top
statistician.  
 Core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, is becoming
“worrisome,” Sen told reporters in New Delhi today. Sen isn’t
connected with the central bank, which sets the monetary policy.  
 Core inflation accelerated to 6.58 percent in May from 0.8
percent in December, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. economist
 Sonal Varma . Reserve Bank of India Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao 
said June 18 that rates will be increased in a “calibrated”
way, given the cash shortage in the economy and risks to growth
posed by Europe’s debt crisis.  
 The yield on the 10-year government bond gained one basis
point to 7.58 percent at 11:13 a.m. in Mumbai after Sen’s
comments.  
 India’s benchmark wholesale-price  inflation rate  advanced
10.16 percent in May.  
 “It can do it at anytime,” Sen said, referring to the
central bank increasing borrowing costs. “That is a call they
have to take.”  
 The Reserve Bank has increased rates twice since mid-March
and is scheduled to announce the next monetary policy decision
on July 27. The bank’s  reverse repurchase rate  is 3.75 percent
and repurchase rate is 5.25 percent.  
 Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  on June 21 said inflation
of between 3.5 percent to 4 percent is “tolerable.”
