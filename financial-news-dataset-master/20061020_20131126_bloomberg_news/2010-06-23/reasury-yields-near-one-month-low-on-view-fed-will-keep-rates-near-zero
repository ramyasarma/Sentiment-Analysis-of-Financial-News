             Treasuries rose, pushing the 10-year
yield within three basis points of the lowest in a year, on
speculation the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near
zero after saying Europe’s debt crisis may hinder growth.  
 Two-year  yields  dropped to their lowest this year after the
Fed said yesterday that “financial conditions have become less
supportive” of growth and a report showed new home sales
slumped. Durable-goods orders likely fell for the first time in
six months, economists said before a report today, adding to
signs the world’s largest economy is losing momentum.  
 “The Fed is more cautious on the U.S. economy and seems to
be more concerned about disinflation pressures, which suggests
to me they are not going to do anything until early next year,”
said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist in Edinburgh at
RIA Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks and investors.
“That will support Treasuries.”  
 The benchmark 10-year note  yield  dropped three basis points
to 3.09 percent as of 7:03 a.m. in New York, according to
BGCantor Market Data. It fell to 3.06 on May 25, a level not
seen since April 2009. The 3.5 percent security due May 2020
gained 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 103 16/32.  
 The 10-year yield may drop toward 3 percent “in the next
few weeks,” Stamenkovic said. The median of 63 economists and
strategists’ predictions compiled by Bloomberg is for the yield
to end the year at 3.8 percent.  
 The two-year  yield  fell three basis points to 0.65 percent,
after dropping to 0.63 percent, the least since November.  
 Policy makers kept their target rate for overnight lending
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where it has
been since December 2008. The  decision  was forecast by all of
the 98 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 ‘Improving Gradually’  
 “The economic recovery is proceeding” and “the labor
market is improving gradually,” the Federal Open Market
Committee said in its statement. Central bankers cited slowing
inflation and said the recovery is “proceeding,” altering
April language that the economy has “continued to strengthen.”  
 Orders for  durable goods  fell 1.4 percent in May, after
increasing 2.8 percent the previous month, according to a
Bloomberg survey before today’s Commerce Department report.  New
home sales  slumped 32.7 percent in May after a tax credit
expired, the Commerce Department said yesterday.  
 Investors also sought the perceived safety of fixed income
as European stocks declined. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600
Index slid 0.8 percent. U.S. stock-index futures also declined.  
 ‘Subdued’  
 “U.S. numbers have been subdued and that’s thrown into
doubt the strength of the recovery,” said  Orlando Green , an
interest-rates strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “As a result, we’re seeing bullish
bond markets.”  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange show a 20 percent
chance policy makers will increase the Fed funds target by at
least a quarter-percentage point by the December 2010 meeting,
down from 30 percent odds a month earlier.  
 The U.S. is scheduled to sell $30 billion of seven-year
debt today, the third of three note auctions this week totaling
$108 billion.  
 The Treasury sold five-year notes yesterday at a yield of
1.995 percent, compared with the average forecast of 1.961
percent in a Bloomberg survey. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, fell to 2.58 from 2.71 at the May 26
auction.  
 A sale of $40 billion in two-year notes on June 22 produced
a record low yield of 0.738 percent.
