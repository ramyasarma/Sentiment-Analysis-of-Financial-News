             Growth in Europe’s  services and
manufacturing   industries  slowed in June, adding to signs a
European recovery is cooling.  
 A  composite index  based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both industries fell to 56 from 56.4 in May, London-
based  Markit Economics  said today. Economists forecast a drop to
55.8, the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  
 Rising  unemployment  is prompting consumers to hold back
spending, leaving exports to lead the region’s  recovery  from the
worst recession in six decades. European economic  confidence 
unexpectedly worsened in May after concerns that the Greek
deficit crisis is spreading clouded the growth outlook.  
 “The PMI will probably continue to weaken over the coming
months,” said  Costa Brunner , an economist at Natixis in
Frankfurt. “We’re past the best in terms of global trade growth
and we can’t expect much of a contribution from  consumer demand .
The economic picture isn’t quite as positive anymore.”  
 The euro was little changed against the dollar after the
data, trading at $1.2287 at 9:08 a.m. in London, up 0.1 percent
on the day.  
 The euro-area economy is showing some signs of losing
momentum.  Unemployment  unexpectedly rose in April to the highest
in almost 12 years, and investors grew more pessimistic this
month.  
 An  index of services , which account for about 60 percent of
the euro region’s gross domestic product, fell to 55.4 in June
from 56.2 in the prior month, Markit said. A gauge of euro-area
 manufacturing  declined to 55.6 from 55.8 in May.
