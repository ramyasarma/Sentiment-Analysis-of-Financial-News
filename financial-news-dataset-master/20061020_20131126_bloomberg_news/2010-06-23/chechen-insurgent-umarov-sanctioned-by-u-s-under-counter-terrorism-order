             U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton has designated Chechen insurgent leader Doku Umarov for
anti-terrorism sanctions aimed at stemming the flow of money and
other aid to him, the State Department said.  
 “The recent attacks perpetrated by Umarov and his
operatives illustrate the global nature of the terrorist problem
we face today,” State Department counter-terrorism coordinator
Daniel Benjamin said in an e-mailed statement today. “We stand
in solidarity with the Russian people in our condemnation of
these deplorable terrorist acts.”  
 The U.S. action came on the eve of Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev’s visit to Washington. Umarov claimed responsibility
for dual suicide bombings in Moscow subway stations in March
that killed 40 people.
