             U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
wrote to Britain’s 6 million public-sector workers to ask for
help in finding ways to spending.  
 Workers are asked in the letter, co-signed by Deputy Prime
Minister  Nick Clegg , to report non-essential government-funded
activities, send in ideas to increase efficiency and say how
money could be saved by involving private companies, the Cabinet
Office said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “We want you to help us find those savings, so we can cut
public spending in a way that is fair and responsible,” Cameron
wrote. “You know where things are working well, where the waste
is, and where we can rethink things so that we get better
services for less money.”  
 Public-sector workers will have until July 9 to send in
ideas to a designated  website , after which the appeal will be
opened up to the rest of the population. Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  said in his June 22 budget that
departments other than the National Health Service and
international aid will have to find average savings of 25
percent to help tackle Britain’s  record budget deficit .
