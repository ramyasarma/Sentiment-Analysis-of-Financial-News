             Microsoft Corp. ’s Bing search engine
is adding an  entertainment page  that allow users to watch
television shows, play games and listen to music without leaving
the website.  
 Bing is providing local TV times, movie listings and access
to song lyrics,  Yusuf Mehdi , senior vice president of
Microsoft’s online audience business, said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement. The company invited press to an event in West
Hollywood, California, to announce the updates.  
 The features may help Microsoft gain ground on  Google
Inc. ’s dominant search engine. A survey of Bing users found that
76 percent want one online destination for entertainment options
to eliminate clutter, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said.
Bing organizes search results into TV shows, music, video games
and movies.  
 “As the content on the Web has exploded, it has become
difficult to navigate and find what you are looking for,” Mehdi
said in the statement. “So we see a great opportunity to help
customers make important entertainment decisions.”  
 Microsoft, the world’s biggest software maker, fell 18
cents to $25.77 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The
shares have declined 15 percent this year.  
 Using Microsoft’s Zune music service, Bing provides one-
time access to 5 million full-length songs and then 30-second
clips afterwards, according to  Adam Sohn , a spokesman. Listeners
will also be able to buy the track, read the lyrics and find
concert information.  
 The service also lets users watch 1,500 TV shows and 20,000
full-length episodes of programs posted at  Hulu.com , YouTube.com
and at the websites of cable and TV networks, without ever
actually leaving the Microsoft website.  
 Reviews, Program Times  
 Bing also provides reviews, program times and the ability
to invite friends to watch together on Facebook, Twitter and
other social networks, Microsoft said. Users will also be able
to find movie times and buy tickets, and watch trailers and
clips with search results.  
 Consumers can use the site to find video-game reviews and
tips. The site is providing 100 casual games, including
“Bejeweled” and “Bubble Town,” that can be played on the
search results page. Friends can also be invited to play along
through Facebook.
