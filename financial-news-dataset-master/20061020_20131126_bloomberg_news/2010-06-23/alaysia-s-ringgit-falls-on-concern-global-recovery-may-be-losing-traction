             The ringgit fell for a second day
after an unexpected drop in U.S. home sales underscored concern
about the strength of the global recovery, curbing demand for
assets of those nations that rely on exports to drive growth.  
 The currency dropped as the  MSCI  Asia-Pacific Index of
shares slid the most in two weeks. The National Association of
Realtors said yesterday  sales  of previously owned homes in the
U.S., Malaysia’s third-biggest export market, dropped 2 percent
in May. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a 6
percent increase. The ringgit climbed to its strongest level in
almost two months this week after China scrapped the yuan’s peg
to the dollar.  
 “The U.S. data led to concern the global economy will not
be as strong as people expected, discouraging investment in
riskier assets and hurting the ringgit,” said  Akira Banno , a
treasury adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in Kuala
Lumpur. “The main trend remains for the ringgit to appreciate
on the Chinese yuan story, but the currency sees a correction
when investors sell stocks.”  
 The ringgit slid 0.7 percent to 3.2303 per dollar as of
9:40 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.1803 on June 21, its strongest
level since April 30. The ringgit will rise to about 3.15 this
month, Banno said.  
 The value of Malaysia’s shipments to the U.S. climbed 6
percent from a year earlier to 5.18 billion ringgit ($1.6
billion) in April, according to government data. The U.S. buys
about 10 percent of the nation’s exports.
