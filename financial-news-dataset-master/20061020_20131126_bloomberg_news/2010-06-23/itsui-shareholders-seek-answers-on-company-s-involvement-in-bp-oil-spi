             Executives of  Mitsui & Co. , owner of
an indirect stake in the BP Plc-operated field leaking oil in
the Gulf of Mexico, faced questions from shareholders about the
company’s liability for the worst spill in U.S. history.  
 More than 920 investors attended the company’s annual
general meeting in Tokyo today, according to Mitsui’s own
estimates, about twice last year’s number. President  Masami Iijima  said he couldn’t say what impact the spill may have on
earnings before a Q&A session dominated by shareholders wanting
to know more.  
 “Mitsui’s explanations weren’t enough,” said Toru
Nishizawa, 59, a retiree from Misato City in Tokyo’s outer
suburbs who has  held  the shares for three or four years. “The
only reason I came here today was to know how Mitsui is handling
this case.”  
 Mitsui has  plunged  25 percent since an April 20 explosion
on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers and
triggered a disaster that may cost as much $50.8 billion,
according to ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a Washington-based
policy analysis firm. U.S. Representative  Edward Markey  has said
Mitsui together with BP partner Anadarko Petroleum Corp. should
pay into a multibillion-dollar fund for leak claims.  
 “The cause of the accident or responsibility for that
hasn’t been clarified,” Iijima told shareholders. “Now isn’t
the proper time to assess the impact on our earnings.  
 Mitsui shares dropped 2.6 percent to close at 1,145 yen in
Tokyo  compared  with a 1.5 percent decline in the benchmark Topix
index.  
 ‘Independent Entities’  
 Japan’s second-biggest trading company owns 70 percent of
 Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. , which holds 10 percent of the field
where the leaking Macondo well is located through wholly owned
U.S. subsidiary Moex Offshore 2007, according to the website of
Mitsui Oil. Anadarko, based in The Woodlands, Texas, owns 25
percent.  
 “MOECO and Moex Offshore 2007 are independent entities,
and Mitsui & Co. wouldn’t directly deal with this case in the
Gulf,” Iijima said in answer to a general question about the
consequences of the spill. “Again, the causes, liability or
damages from the accident haven’t become clear yet.”  
 Mitsui made the investment based on its judgment “that BP
has experience and past success in deepwater oil drilling and on
our understanding that BP had done nothing wrong with their
safety measures,” Iijima said.  
 Anadarko has said BP should bear the whole costs of the
spill because it acted unsafely at the drilling site.  
 “BP’s behavior and actions likely represent gross
negligence or willful misconduct and thus affect the obligations
of the parties under the operating agreement,” Chief Executive
Officer  Jim Hackett  said in a June 18 statement.
