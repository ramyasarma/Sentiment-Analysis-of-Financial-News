             Pfizer Inc. , the world’s biggest
drugmaker, said it suspended trials of its experimental pain
relief drug, tanezumab, for osteoarthritis after reports that
patients’ conditions worsened and led to joint replacements.  
 Pfizer, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, isn’t recruiting any new patients or giving the
drug to patients already in 10  osteoarthritis  trials or those
with the condition taking the drug in studies for other
diseases, the New York-based company said today in a statement.  
 Tanezumab would generate an estimated $100 million in
annual  sales  by the end of 2012, and $260 million by 2013,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The drug was one of
500 projects the company had preserved in a pared-down
development portfolio. Pfizer said in April 2009 that the drug
as a treatment for the pain of osteoarthritis in the knee had
moved into the third and final stage of testing usually needed
for regulatory approval.  
 The FDA asked the company to show data on potential effects
in clinical studies of the drug among patients with cancer pain,
interstitial cystitis, chronic low back pain and painful
diabetic peripheral neuropathy, Pfizer said.  
 The agency will then decide whether to halt Pfizer’s
remaining trials of tanezumab after reviewing company data.
Trials for other conditions haven’t reported similar adverse
events, MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman, said in a telephone
interview.  
 “Patient safety is a top priority for Pfizer,” Jimeson
said in an e-mail. “We are coordinating closely with regulatory
authorities and investigators to implement the clinical hold in
the osteoarthritis studies and for patients with co-morbid
osteoarthritis in the chronic pain program.”
