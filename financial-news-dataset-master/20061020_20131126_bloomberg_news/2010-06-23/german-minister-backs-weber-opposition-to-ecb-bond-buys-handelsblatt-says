             Rainer Bruederle , Germany’s economy
minister, backed Bundesbank President  Axel Weber ’s opposition to
government bond purchases by the European Central Bank,
 Handelsblatt  reported.  
 Weber’s criticism of the ECB’s decision to start buying
government debt on the secondary market last month may improve
his chances of succeeding  Jean-Claude Trichet  as ECB president,
the newspaper quoted Bruederle as saying in a television program
to be aired June 27.
