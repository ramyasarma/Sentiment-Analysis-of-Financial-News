             The U.S. Federal Reserve will keep
its key rate unchanged until 2012 because of high unemployment
and low inflation, said  Edward McKelvey , senior U.S. economist
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York.  
 Goldman predicts no rate change until 2012 “because the
 unemployment rate  is very high, because inflation is well below
the Fed’s objective, and is actually drifting down,” McKelvey
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s “Inside
Track” program today. “They’re really missing on both their
targets and there’s no reason to raise rates at this point.”  
 Fed officials, who are likely to repeat the commitment to
an “extended period” of low  interest rates  in a Washington
meeting today, are contending with joblessness that’s still
close to a 26-year high. Rising foreclosures and a drop in new
home sales are threatening to harm the recovery.  
 Weaker home sales are “the reflection of an extreme excess
supply in the industry which has been apparent for several years
and will persist for a while,” McKelvey said. “As long as
that’s the case it’s hard to forecast significant improvement.”
