             Grupo Bimbo SAB , the world’s largest
bread maker, sold $800 million of 10-year dollar bonds in its
first international issue.  
 The 4.875 percent notes due in 2020 priced to yield 4.91
percent, or 180 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. Bank of America Corp., Barclays
Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc arranged the sale.  
 Mexico City-based Bimbo sold debt abroad as Latin American
companies return to the overseas market after a European debt
crisis sparked a two-month drought. Yields on Mexican  corporate
debt  relative to benchmark Treasuries have declined half a
percentage point from their May high to 334 basis points
yesterday, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. data.  
 Bimbo’s offering is the second international debt sale from
a Latin American company announced this week and follows a $3.1
billion euro and pound sale by America Movil SAB last week. Sao
Paulo-based  Banco Votorantim SA  is meeting with investors this
week and state-owned Mexican oil company Petroleos Mexicanos is
conducting meetings this month, people familiar with the
transactions said.
