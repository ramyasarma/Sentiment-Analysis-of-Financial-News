             Portugal Telecom SGPS SA Chairman
Henrique Granadeiro said there is “surely” a conflict of
interest if Telefonica SA of Spain votes at a shareholder
meeting on its own offer to buy Portugal Telecom’s stake in a
venture that controls Vivo Participacoes SA.  
 Granadeiro spoke last night in an interview with Economico
TV and declined to say whether Telefonica should be allowed to
vote.  
 Portugal Telecom, Portugal’s biggest telecommunications
company, is asking investors to vote June 30 on an increased 6.5
billion-euro bid from Telefonica for its stake in the venture
that controls Brazilian wireless operator Vivo. Telefonica owns
10 percent of Portugal Telecom.
