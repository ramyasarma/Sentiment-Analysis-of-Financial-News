             Ukraine pledged to meet a budget
deficit target set by the International Monetary Fund as the
former Soviet state works to ensure bailout payments continue.  
 The Kiev-based government is committed to achieving a 5.3
percent deficit this year, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said at
a weekly government meeting today. The deficit is at 1.5 percent
of gross domestic product as of today, he said.  
 An IMF mission is in Ukraine this week as the government
tries to obtain a $19 billion loan to replace the existing $16.4
billion arrangement of which $10.6 has been paid out.  
 “We regard cooperation with the IMF as an important
instrument to stabilize our economy,” Azarov said.  
 The cabinet has spent 9 billion hryvnia ($1.14 billion)
since January to increase pensions and salaries, Azarov said,
adding that further increases are needed. Budget revenue from
taxes increased 23.7 percent, he said. The government has
“optimized” its spending, according to the prime minister.  
 The deficit at Ukraine’s state energy company NAK Naftogaz
Ukrainy won’t exceed 1 percent of GDP this year, Fuel and Energy
Minister  Yuriy Boyko  said at today’s cabinet meeting.
