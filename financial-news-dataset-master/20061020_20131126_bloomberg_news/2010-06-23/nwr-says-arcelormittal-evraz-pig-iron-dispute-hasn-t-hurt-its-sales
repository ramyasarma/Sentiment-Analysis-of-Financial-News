             New World Resources NV , the Czech
Republic’s largest producer of coking coal, said negotiations
between Czech units ArcelorMittal and Evraz Group SA on pig iron
prices hasn’t affected NWR’s sales.  
 “At the moment we can state that our sales are not
impacted at all by the situation and talks between ArcelorMittal
and Evraz,” head of Corporate Communications  Petra Masinova 
said in an e-mail. NWR, which is monitoring the situation,
isn’t entitled to comment on the talks between the two other
companies, Masinova said.  
 NWR sells coal to customers including the Czech unit of
ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker. Evraz Group SA,
Russia’s second largest steelmaker, said yesterday that it plans
to temporarily close its capacity in Vitkovice in the northeast
of the Czech Republic, unless it reaches a new settlement for
prices of pig iron, a raw material supplied by ArcelorMittal
Ostrava AS, its facility in the same region.  
 NWR rose 0.9 koruna, or 0.4 percent, to 234 koruna as of
11:47 a.m. in Prague trading.
