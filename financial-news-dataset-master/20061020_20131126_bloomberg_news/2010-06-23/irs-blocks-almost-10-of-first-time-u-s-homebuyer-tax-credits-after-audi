             The Internal Revenue Service blocked
almost 10 percent of U.S. claims for the first-time homebuyer
tax credit after receiving erroneous or fraudulent filings,
according to a  report  today.  
 About $1.22 billion of the $12.6 billion in tax credits
claimed through February were denied or frozen after audits, the
report from the Treasury Department’s Inspector General for Tax
Administration said. The IRS estimated that about 1.8 million
taxpayers sought the benefit, which totals as much as $8,000,
from the inception in April 2008.  
 The claims in question included about $9.1 million from
1,295 prison inmates, $18.8 million from people who bought homes
before the law took effect and $134 million from situations
where more than one filer said they bought the same house, the
report said.  
 “Although I am pleased that the fraud identified earlier
does not continue, I am concerned about prisoners claiming the
credit,” Representative  John Lewis , a Georgia Democrat, said in
a statement today. “I am also disturbed by 67 people claiming
the credit for a single address and millions of dollars claimed
by people who purchased homes before the program started.”  
 To receive the government incentive, buyers must have
signed contracts by April 30 and complete deals by the end of
this month. Filers seeking the credit totaled $18.7 billion at
the end of April,  Bruce Friedland , an IRS spokesman in
Washington, said in a telephone interview.  
 Sales Boost  
 The homebuyer tax credits helped revive housing sales,
which fell to a record low annual pace of 4.53 million in
January 2009, according to data from the National Association of
Realtors dating back to 1999. The sales rate rose to as high as
6.49 million in November, when the tax credit was originally
scheduled to expire.  
 Existing-home sales sank 2.2 percent from April to May, the
Chicago-based NAR said yesterday.  New-home sales  plunged last
month by 33 percent to the lowest level on record after the
expiration of the tax credit, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in Washington.
