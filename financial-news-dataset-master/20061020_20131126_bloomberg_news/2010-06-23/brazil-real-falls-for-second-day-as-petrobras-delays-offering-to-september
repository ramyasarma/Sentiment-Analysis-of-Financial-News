             Brazil’s real fell for a second
straight day as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Latin America’s biggest
company by market value, delayed the sale of as much as $25
billion of stock until September.  
 The real declined 0.5 percent to 1.7969 per dollar at 1:32
p.m. New York time, from 1.7880 yesterday.  
 The offering to minority shareholders, originally planned
for July, is tied to an agreement to buy rights to as much as 5
billion barrels of oil from the government with stock.
Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil company is known,
said in a statement late yesterday industry regulators will
assess the value of such reserves by the end of August.  
 “The markets were expecting the Petrobras deal to
happen,” said  Roberto Melzi , a currency strategist at Barclays
Capital in New York. “They had priced it in, so that may
provide further explanation into the weakness we’re seeing in
the real.”  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks dropped as
much as 0.9 percent today as purchases of new homes in the U.S.
fell in May to the lowest level on record.  
 “Latin currencies have been moving alongside with risk
aversion,” Melzi said. “This news adds into the bearish
momentum we have been seeing since the beginning of the week.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 11.31 percent.
