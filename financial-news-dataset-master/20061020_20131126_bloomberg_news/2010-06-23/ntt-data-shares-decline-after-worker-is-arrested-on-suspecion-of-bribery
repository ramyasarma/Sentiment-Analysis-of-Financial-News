             NTT Data Corp. , the network-services
unit of Japan’s largest phone company, fell the most in 17
months in Tokyo trading after the company said one of its
employees had been arrested on suspicion of bribing a bureaucrat.  
 The shares  declined 7.7 percent to 353,000 yen as of 10:19
a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest drop since Jan. 23,
2009. The stock was the worst performing member of the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average, which retreated 1.7 percent.  
 The Tokyo-based company’s worker was arrested on suspicion
of bribing an employee at Japan Patent Office, NTT Data said in
a  statement  yesterday. The company expressed its “deep regret”
and said it’s cooperating with the investigation.  
 “Judging from cases in the past, involvement in scandals
could lead to the loss of new contracts,” said  Nobumasa Morimoto , an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. “This shouldn’t
impact the company’s existing contracts, so major damage is
unlikely.”  
 Morimoto has an “outperform” rating on NTT Data.
