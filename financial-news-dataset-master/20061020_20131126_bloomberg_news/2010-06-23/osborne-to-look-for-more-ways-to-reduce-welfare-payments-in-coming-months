             U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne said he will seek further cuts to welfare in the
coming months to reduce the pressure on govenrment departments
that are facing real-terms reductions of 25 percent.   
 “I hope that number can come down if we can find more
welfare savings in the next few months,” Osborne said in an
interview with BBC Television.
