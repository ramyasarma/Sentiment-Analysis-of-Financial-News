             The Norwegian krone may decline as
the central bank today keeps the benchmark deposit rate at 2
percent and probably reduces its rate forecast, according to
Citigroup Inc.  
 The krone may weaken as Norges Bank will probably push a
quarter-point interest rate increase to December, falling short
of its current forecast which indicated rate increases in
September and December, Michael Hart, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Citigroup in London, wrote in a note to clients
today. Futures and options prices suggest the market sees a 56
percent probability of two rate increases this year, Hart wrote.  
 “The cocktail of slower domestic growth, more moderate pay
gains, European debt woes and lower global interest rate
expectations suggest that the Norges Bank will be in no hurry to
raise rates in the second half of the year,” Hart said. “If
vague concerns become reality and the Norges Bank does revise
its conditional interest rate path downwards today, the krone
could witness another leg lower.”
