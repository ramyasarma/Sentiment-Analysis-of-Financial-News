             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, said it obtained a credit line of
as much as $1 billion from the Agency of Credit and Exportation
of Norway, known as GIEK.  
 The credit line is part of an agreement that aims to
identify business opportunities between Norwegian suppliers and
Petrobras, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a
regulatory filing.
