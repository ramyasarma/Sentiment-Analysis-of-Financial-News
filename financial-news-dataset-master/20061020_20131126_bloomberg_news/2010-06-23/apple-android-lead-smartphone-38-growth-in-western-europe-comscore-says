             Apple Inc. ’s iPhone led a 38 percent
increase in smartphone ownership in western Europe in the year
through April.  
 Apple more than doubled its iPhone installed base to 10
million users, accounting for almost a fifth of all smartphones
in use, Reston, Virginia-based market researcher ComScore Inc.
said in a report. Handsets using  Google Inc. ’s Android operating
system jumped 25-fold to 1.8 million users in the European
Union’s five biggest countries, ComScore said.  
 The iPhone 4, being rolled out to users this week, may
accelerate competition among vendors of smartphones, the
fastest-growing segment of the mobile-phone industry. Symbian,
the smartphone software used by  Nokia Oyj  and the best-selling
platform worldwide, grew 18 percent to 33 million users in the
region.  Research In Motion Ltd. ’s BlackBerry added 87 percent to
4.6 million users.  
 “The iPhone has had a disproportionate impact on the
European mobile market, considering its relatively modest
installed base,” said  Jeremy Copp , a ComScore vice president.
“It has catalyzed the consumption of mobile media and opened
the eyes of brands to mobile. It has also prompted other vendors
to elevate their game so the poster child of the smartphone
generation now faces serious competition.”  
 Google’s Android is “the one to watch” for propelling
growth, he added, noting that users of the platform consume
mobile media almost as avidly as iPhone customers.
