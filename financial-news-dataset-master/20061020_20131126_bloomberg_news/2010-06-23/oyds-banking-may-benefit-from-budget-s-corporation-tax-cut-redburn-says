             Lloyds Banking Group Plc  may benefit
overall from Chancellor  George Osborne ’s budget, as it gains
more from a cut to corporation tax than it loses from Britain’s
new bank levy, according to an analyst at Redburn Partners LLP.  
 Lloyds , 41 percent British government-owned, may see a 3
percent rise in its earnings a share in 2012, as corporation tax
begins falling to 24 percent from 28 percent over four years,
wrote London-based Redburn analyst  Jon Kirk  in a note to
investors. “It is a net positive for Lloyds,” wrote Kirk. By
contrast, Barclays Plc will lose 4 percent of its earnings a
share, the report said.  
 Osborne said Britain would impose the annual levy on bank
balance sheets yesterday to discourage risky practices, as he
presented the coalition government’s new budget to Parliament
yesterday. The reforms will bring “a greater contribution from
the banking sector, one that far outweighs any benefit they
receive from the lower tax rates,” Osborne said.  
 Lloyds  gained  2.7 percent to 60.57 pence 10:40 a.m. in
London, valuing the bank at 40.7 billion pounds.
