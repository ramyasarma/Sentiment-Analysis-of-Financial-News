             Nike Inc. , the world’s largest maker
of athletic shoes, posted a 53 percent gain in fiscal fourth-
quarter profit as sales grew in North America and emerging
markets.  
 Net income  rose to $521.9 million, or $1.06 a share, in the
quarter ended May 31 from $341.4 million, or 70 cents, a year
earlier, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company said today in a
statement. While that matched the average  estimate  of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, some investors had expected a beat and
the stock declined in after-hours trading.  
 “It’s basically an in-line quarter and Nike usually gives
a little cushion and they beat,” said  Chris Svezia , an analyst
for Susquehanna Financial Group in New York who has a
“neutral”  rating  on Nike shares. “The stock was expensive. It
needed to be picture perfect.”  
 Nike has offset slowing growth by expanding in emerging
markets. Chief Executive Officer  Mark Parker  highlighted the
growing middle class in China, India and Brazil last month as a
key to the company’s plan of increasing revenue more than 40
percent in the next five years.  
 Nike  fell $1.52 to $71 at 5:10 p.m. in after-hours  trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares rose 6 cents to
$72.52 in regular trading today and have  climbed  9.8 percent
this year.  
 Orders for Nike brand athletic footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery from June to November rose 10 percent,
excluding currency effects, compared with a year ago. The
average estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for
a gain of 8.1 percent.  
 Sales Trail Projections  
 Sales gained 8 percent to $5.08 billion, trailing analysts’
estimates of $5.15 billion. Revenue from the Nike brand in North
America, the company’s largest market, increased 4 percent to
$1.8 billion as footwear sales rose 1 percent to $1.2 billion.
Revenue in the company’s China region grew 12 percent to $464
million, and emerging-market sales climbed 47 percent to $556
million.  
 Marketing expenses increased 43 percent to $666 million in
the quarter from a year ago. The footwear-maker had a
restructuring charge of $144.5 million, or 29 cents a share in
the year-earlier period.
