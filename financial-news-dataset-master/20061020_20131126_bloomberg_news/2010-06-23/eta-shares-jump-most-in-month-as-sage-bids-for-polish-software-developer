             Teta SA , a Polish software
developer, jumped the most in four months after Sage Group Plc
announced a bid to buy 100 percent of the company for 151
million zloty ($46 million).  
 Teta , based in the southern Polish city of Wroclaw, climbed
7.2 percent to 12.6 zloty at 10:22 a.m. in Warsaw, a close at
that level would be the biggest gain since Feb. 24. The
benchmark WIG20 Index declined 0.5 percent to 2,366.70 today.  
 Sage , the U.K.’s largest software maker, offered to pay
12.75 zloty for all of Teta’s shares as it seeks to expand in
central Europe’s largest economy, it said in an e-mailed
statement today. The firm’s bid exceeds that of Dutch-based
Unit4 NV, which last month offered to pay 11.75 zloty for 100
percent of Teta.  
 Unit4 Chief Financial Officer  Edwin van Leeuwen  wasn’t
immediately available when contacted by phone today.  
 UniCredit SpA advises Sage on Teta’s takeover.
