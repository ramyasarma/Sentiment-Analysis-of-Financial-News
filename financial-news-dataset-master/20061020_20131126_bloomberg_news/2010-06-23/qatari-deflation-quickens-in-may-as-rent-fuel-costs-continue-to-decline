             Qatari deflation quickened to 3.6
percent in May, the fastest since February, as rent and fuel
costs declined, the Gulf state’s statistics office said.  
 Deflation accelerated from 2.9 percent in April, the e-
mailed data showed. The cost of rent, fuel and power declined an
annual 16 percent in May from a drop of 14.3 percent in April,
the biggest fall in at least five months, the data showed.  
 Prices continue to fall in Qatar due to declining housing
and energy costs, even as inflation picks up in neighboring
Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s largest economy, and the United
Arab Emirates. A weaker euro may decrease inflationary pressures
in the Gulf region, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 Consumer prices declined 0.1 percent on the month in May
from a rise of 0.3 percent in April.
