             The ruble weakened for a second day
against the dollar as oil, Russia’s chief export, declined on
speculation the global recovery will flag.  
 Russia’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 31.0400 per
dollar at the close in Moscow, extending yesterday’s 0.4 percent
drop. The government’s benchmark sovereign dollar bonds due
April 2020 fell, pushing the yield 2 basis points higher to 5.39
percent.  
 Crude oil for August delivery fell 1.4 percent to $76.76 a
barrel in New York after U.S. crude inventories increased the
most since April and existing-homes sales fell, missing
economist estimates and signaling the world’s largest energy
consumer may be struggling to sustain an economic recovery.  
 Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
31.2700 per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of
31.1412 on June 22. The contracts are a guide to expectations of
currency movements as they allow foreign investors and companies
to fix the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The ruble was 0.3 percent weaker at 38.1250 per euro. The
movements against the dollar and the euro left the ruble at
34.2197 against the central bank’s  target  currency basket, which
it uses to manage swings that hurt Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
