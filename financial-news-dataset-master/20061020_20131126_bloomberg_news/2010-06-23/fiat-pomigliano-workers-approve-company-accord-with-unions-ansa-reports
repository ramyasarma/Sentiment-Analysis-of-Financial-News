             Workers at a Fiat SpA factory in
southern Italy approved an accord between the carmaker and
unions concerning the plant’s future, Ansa news agency reported.  
 Workers at the factory in Pomigliano, near Naples, voted 63
percent in favor of the plan, Ansa said. The accord between the
company and all but one of the unions representing its workers
may pave the way for 700 million euros in investments for the
plant, setting it up to produce Fiat’s new Panda model, Ansa
said.
