             Commodity shipping costs measured by
the Baltic Dry Index extended their longest losing streak in 14
months because of an expanding surplus of vessels and declining
Chinese imports of iron ore and coal.  
 Growth in China, the world’s biggest consumer of both
commodities, will slow to 10.5 percent this quarter and 9.6
percent in the following three months, compared with 11.9
percent in the first quarter, according to the median forecast
of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The nation’s coal and
iron-ore  imports  fell in April and May, customs data show.  
 Shipping lines were counting on expanding demand to bolster
business for new vessels joining the fleet. The global fleet of
capesizes, which haul 170,000 metric-ton cargoes of iron ore and
coal, was at 1,031 at the start of June, up from 950 in January,
according to Arctic Securities ASA. That may reach 1,150 by the
fourth quarter, Arctic estimates.  
 “There’s been a constant increasing pace of deliveries and
China’s iron-ore imports have cooled down,” said  Martin Sommerseth Jaer , an analyst at Arctic in Oslo who has followed
shipping for six years. “The market is being hit from two
sides. You have the supply side which is killing you and you
have a break in demand.”  
 The index fell 32 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,515 points
today, according to the Baltic Exchange in London. That’s the
19th consecutive drop, the longest losing streak since April
2009. Daily rates for capesizes declined 4.3 percent to $24,064
a day, the lowest since Sept. 28. Capesize costs may drop to
$20,000 by next week, Jaer said. That would be the lowest since
April 2009.  
 Bolstering Returns  
 Rents for capesizes, vessels three times the size of the
Statue of Liberty, had more than doubled from the middle of
April to the beginning of this month, peaking at $59,324 on June
2, bolstering returns for Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., Nippon Yusen
K.K. and China Cosco Holdings Co. Lines of ships at the iron-ore
ports of Tubarao in Brazil and Qingdao in China had lengthened,
reflecting resurgent demand as the global economy recovered.  
 Shipping costs have retreated as those lines shortened.
There were 34 capesizes at  anchorage  outside major ore and coal
berths in China, according to a June 18 report from Truro,
England-based Global Ports, which tracks the shipping lines. A
month earlier, there were 43 capesizes waiting.  
 The nation’s coal imports slumped 11 percent in April and
almost 19 percent in May, customs data show. Imports of iron
ore, used to make steel, fell more than 6 percent in both
months, the first back-to-back monthly declines since the middle
of 2008.  
 Dry Ships Index  
 Shares of Nippon Yusen dropped 3.6 percent, the most in a
month, in Tokyo trading today.  Mitsui O.S.K.  declined 2.7
percent and shares in China Cosco fell 0.9 percent in Hong Kong.
The 12-member  Bloomberg Dry Ships Index  retreated 22 percent
since reaching a 15-month closing high on Jan. 11.  
 Chinese stocks fell today on concern that the government,
which is seeking to cool real-estate speculation, is extending
its tightening measures from the property industry to
commodities.  
 Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. and Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co. slid
at least 2 percent after the government said it will remove
export tax rebates on some steel and metals products. China
accounted for 45 percent of global  steel  production in May,
according to the World Steel Association in Brussels.
