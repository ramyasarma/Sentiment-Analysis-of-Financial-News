             French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is
meeting two ministers today and  Thierry Henry , the nation’s top
international goal scorer, tomorrow to discuss the country’s
elimination from the soccer World Cup.  
 Sarkozy will discuss the matter with Prime Minister
 Francois Fillon  and  Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin , France’s minister
of health, who counts sports in her portfolio, said government
spokesman  Luc Chatel .  
 “The President wants any decisions to be taken calmly and
without haste,” Chatel said at a press conference. “Knowing
the interest he has in football, you can imagine that he isn’t
indifferent to what happened.”  
 France was eliminated from the 2010 World Cup last night
after losing 2-1 to South Africa, following a 0-0 draw with
Uruguay and a 2-0 loss to Mexico.  
 While other major teams are also struggling, France’s
embarrassment was compounded by a profanity-laden outburst from
striker  Nicolas Anelka  to coach  Raymond Domenech  that ended up
in a newspaper, the expulsion of Anelka, a protest strike by his
teammates, and Domenech’s refusal to shake hands with South
Africa’s coach  Carlos Alberto Parreira  after last night’s match.  
 Tomorrow’s meeting between Sarkozy and Henry, who has
scored 51 goals in 122 appearances for France, was at the
request of the player, said  Franck Louvrier , a spokesman for
Sarkozy. He wouldn’t say what the meeting is about.  
 Henry came on as a substitute for the final 35 minutes of
last night’s match, his only appearance during this World Cup.
