             Lumber prices plunged to an eight-
month low after a  report  showed that new-home sales in the U.S.
fell at a record pace in May, dimming prospects for building
materials.  
 Purchases collapsed an unprecedented 33 percent from April
to an annual pace of 300,000 units, the fewest since at least
1963, the Commerce Department said today. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast a 410,000 annual pace. Lumber futures
have declined as much as 46 percent since April 21, when the
price reached the highest level in almost four years.  
 “Home sales are down 33 percent, so you have an overall
economy issue,” said  Dewey Strickler , the president of Ag Watch
Market Advisors in Nashville, Tennessee. “For grains or any
other commodities to rise, you have to have strong consumer
demand, and we don’t really have that.”  
 Lumber futures for September delivery fell $5, or 2.6
percent, to $187 per 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price touched $183, the lowest level for
a most-active contract since Oct. 9. Lumber has declined 21
percent this year, partly on sluggish demand for building
materials.  
 “Mortgage applications are way down,” said  Jamie Greenough , a futures broker at Global Securities Corp. in
Vancouver. “There is a big backlog of foreclosures in the U.S.,
and that kind of inventory overhang has to be addressed.”
