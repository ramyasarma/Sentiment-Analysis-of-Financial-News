             Swiss stocks retreated for a second
day as financial shares declined and analysts downgraded their
recommendation on  Holcim Ltd.   
 Holcim, the world’s second-largest cement maker, declined
2.2 percent.  UBS AG  and  Credit Suisse Group AG  retreated.  Cie.
Financiere Richemont SA  declined 1.1 percent as Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. cut its recommendation on the stock.  
 The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  lost 81.61, or 1.3
percent, to 6,381.85 in Zurich. The SMI is down 8.4 percent from
this year’s high on April 15 amid speculation that Europe’s debt
crisis may derail the economic recovery. The broader  Swiss
Performance Index  fell 1.2 percent today.  
 The “short-term momentum up-move is slowing and a moderate
short-term correction is on the cards,” Beat Grunder, a
technical analyst at Credit Suisse Private Banking Global
Research in Zurich, wrote in a report today. Grunder cited price
and volume charts for the SMI.  
 UBS and Credit Suisse, the nation’s biggest banks, declined
2.1 percent to 15.58 francs and 1.8 percent to 44.3 francs,
respectively.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. , a 120-year-old private
bank, fell 1.2 percent to 34 francs.  
 Holcim dropped 2.2 percent to 77.1 francs. Morgan Stanley
downgraded the cement maker to “underweight” from “equal
weight.” The brokerage said in a note that “the shares are
trading at historical highs and a premium to peers” and cited
“rising concerns over India and Australia earnings.”  
 Richemont lost 1.1 percent to 41.47 francs. The world’s
biggest jewelry maker had its recommendation cut to “market
perform” from “outperform.”  
 Bossard Holding AG  rose 1.6 percent to 75.5 francs.
Switzerland’s largest screw vendor was upgraded to
“accumulate” from “neutral” at Helvea SA. The brokerage said
the company “is likely to see a stronger-than-expected top- and
bottom-line recovery this year.”
