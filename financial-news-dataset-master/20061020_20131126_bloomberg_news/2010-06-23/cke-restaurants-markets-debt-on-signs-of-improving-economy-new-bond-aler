             CKE Restaurants Inc. , operator of
the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s fast-food chains, is marketing debt
as investors gain confidence the economic recovery won’t stall.  
 CKE Restaurants may sell $600 million of eight-year notes
to help pay for its acquisition by Apollo Management LP,
according to a person familiar with the offering who declined to
be identified because terms aren’t set.  
 Signs that the global economy may continue to strengthen,
including China’s pledge to allow its currency to rise against
the dollar and Spain’s successful 3.5 billion euro ($4.3
billion) auction of bonds, may increase investors’ appetite for
risky assets such as corporate bonds, said  Anthony Valeri , a
market strategist at LPL Financial Corp.  
 “You’re seeing the window open up,” Valeri said in a
telephone interview. “So far it’s mostly been on the
investment-grade side, and though we haven’t seen as much on the
high-yield side, we think it’s coming.”  
 Corporate bond sales have risen 72 percent this week to
$12.7 billion through yesterday, compared with $7.4 billion over
the similar period a week earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 CNH Global NV, the maker of Case and New Holland
agricultural equipment, sold $1.5 billion of debt due in 2017
yesterday in the biggest sale of high-yield, high-risk bonds in
two months, Bloomberg data show. The Amsterdam-based company
initially marketed $1 billion of the debt, according to a person
familiar with the offering.  
 Cantor Boosts Sale  
 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co Inc., a New York-based securities
firm, issued $300 million of notes after increasing the size of
the sale by $50 million, another person said.  
 “We’re in one of those windows which hopefully stays open
for a while, where lots of different supply can come in and be
successfully absorbed in the marketplace,” said  Mark Bamford ,
head of global fixed-income syndicate at Barclays Plc, at a June
21 meeting with reporters.  
 Moody’s Investors Service assigned CKE Restaurants’ senior
secured second-lien notes a grade of B2 and Standard & Poor’s
rated them an equivalent B, the companies said in separate
reports on June 18. CKE Restaurants also planned to seek $100
million in loans to pay for the acquisition, the company said in
a regulatory filing.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own speculative-grade
company debt rose 7 basis points to 675 basis points yesterday
after declining to the lowest in a month on June 21, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  
 High-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB-
by S&P.  
 Spreads on investment-grade corporate debt were unchanged
at 205 basis points, equalling the narrowest since May 31,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
Master Index.  
 Following is a description of at least $3.77 billion of

 DOHA BANK QSC , Qatar’s third-largest bank, may raise as

sheet,  Raghavan Seetharaman  said in a June 16 telephone
interview from Doha. The bank hasn’t decided which currency to
sell the bonds in, he said. The lender said in April that it
planned to sell senior notes in dollars in a statement on the
Qatari bourse, without disclosing the size of the offering.  
 FORETHOUGHT FINANCIAL GROUP INC. plans to sell $150 million
