             German government bonds stayed
higher after a report showed purchases of new homes in the U.S.
fell in May to a record low.  
 The 10-year bund yield declined 4 basis points to 2.65
percent as of 3:07 p.m. in London. The two-year yield was little
changed at 0.59 percent.  
 Home sales plunged a record 33 percent to an annual pace of
300,000 last month from April, less than the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the fewest in data
going back to 1963, figures from the Commerce Department showed
today in Washington. Demand in prior months was revised down.
