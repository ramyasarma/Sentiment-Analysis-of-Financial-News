             John Isner  and  Nicolas Mahut  are
playing the longest tennis match in history at Wimbledon.  
 Tied at 53-53 in the fifth set, the match has now entered
its ninth hour.  
 Before today, the longest match ever played had been a six-
hour, 33-minute first-round match at the 2004 French Open
between Frenchmen  Fabrice Santoro  and  Arnaud Clement .  
 That wasn’t the only record to get broken. Even though the
match isn’t over, Isner, 25, of the U.S., and Mahut, 28, of
France, have already played the most games in a match, while
their fifth set is the longest in Grand Slam history.  
 Isner has served 93 aces, while Mahut had 84. Each broke
 Ivo Karlovic ’s previous record of 51 aces in a men’s singles
match set during a first-round match at Wimbledon in 2005.  
 “It’s amazing,” five-time women’s champion  Venus Williams 
said in a news conference, after she beat Russia’s Ekaterina
Makarova 6-0, 6-4. “It’s a marathon. It’s longer than a
marathon.”  
 The match started yesterday and continued today after
being postponed because of darkness after four sets.
