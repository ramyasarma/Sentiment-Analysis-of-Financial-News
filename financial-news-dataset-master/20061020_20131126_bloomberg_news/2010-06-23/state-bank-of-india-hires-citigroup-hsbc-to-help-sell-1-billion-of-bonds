             State Bank of India , the nation’s
largest lender, hired six banks to help it sell about $1 billion
of bonds, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  
 Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG,
HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG
are arranging the issue, said the person, who asked not to be
named as the timing and size hasn’t been decided.  
 State Bank, based in Mumbai, plans to raise 200 billion
rupees ($4.33 billion) from a share sale in the second half of
the year ending March 31 as demand for loans climbs, it said
this month.
