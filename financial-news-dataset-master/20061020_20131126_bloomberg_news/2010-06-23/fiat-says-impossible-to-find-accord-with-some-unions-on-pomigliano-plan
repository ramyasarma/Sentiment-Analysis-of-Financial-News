             Fiat SpA said it was “impossible”
to find an agreeement with all unions representing workers at
its Pomigliano car plant after a referendum on the company’s
investment plan. Fiat will work with unions which backed the
company’s project, according to a statement distributed by the
carmaker via e-mail.
