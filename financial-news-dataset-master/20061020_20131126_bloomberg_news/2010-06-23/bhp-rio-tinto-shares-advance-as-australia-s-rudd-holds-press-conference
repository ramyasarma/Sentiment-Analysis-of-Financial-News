             BHP Billiton Ltd . and  Rio Tinto Plc 
shares advanced in U.S. trading as Australian Prime Minister
 Kevin Rudd , who has proposed higher taxes on miners, said he
faces a leadership challenge.  
 BHP rose 2 percent to $69.52 and Rio Tinto climbed 3
percent to $51.40 at 8:29 a.m. in New York.  
 Rudd announced an additional tax on natural resource
companies on May 2, and said on June 1 that the 40 percent rate
is “right” because firms aren’t paying a fair amount. On June
23, he said he’s seeking a “sensible and balanced” settlement
with mining companies opposed to his plan for a 40 percent levy
on the industry’s “super” profits.  
 The prime minister said during a press conference today
that some parts of his party no longer support him.
