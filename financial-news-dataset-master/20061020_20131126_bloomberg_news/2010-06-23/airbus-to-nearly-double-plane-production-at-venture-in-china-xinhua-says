             Airbus SAS plans to nearly double
production at its venture in northern China and will roll out
48 A320 aircraft in 2012, the official Xinhua news agency
reported, citing executives from the Tianjin-based company.  
 The company is “gearing up” production and cutting costs
to increase efficiency, Zhao Haishan, chairman of the Airbus
Final Assembly Line China, was quoted as saying. Its financial
performance is better than expected and costs are declining as
the company buys more from local suppliers, he said.
