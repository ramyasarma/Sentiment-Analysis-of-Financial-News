             U.S. stocks slumped, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a third straight loss, after the
Federal Reserve signaled that European indebtedness may harm
American growth.  
 The S&P 500 decreased 0.4 percent to 1,090.87 at 2:19 p.m.
in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.96 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 10,300.48 as Boeing Co. advanced 1.8 percent.
