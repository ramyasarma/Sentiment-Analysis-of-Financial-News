             Corn and soybeans fell on
speculation that warmer weather in the U.S. will dry out wet
fields, enabling farmers to wrap up planting and boosting crop
prospect.  
 Parts of Iowa and Illinois were soaked with six times
normal rainfalls in the past two weeks, National Weather Service
 data  show. U.S. growers will seed 101.8 million acres with corn
this year, up 1.7 percent from a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said in a  June report .  
 “For corn, you’re looking at bigger acres and ideal
growing conditions,” said  Louise Gartner , the owner of Spectrum
Commodities in Beavercreek, Ohio. “When you’re talking about
corn, you’re talking about Iowa and Illinois, and they look good
right now.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 3.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.685 a bushel at 10:18 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Before today, the price declined 10 percent this year,
partly because of sagging demand.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery slipped 9.25 cents,
or 1 percent, to $9.2675 a bushel in Chicago. Before today,
futures declined 11 percent this year.
