             China’s new rules on online payment 
services may force Internet companies including Tencent 
Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba.com Ltd. to change their 
shareholdings, the Financial Times reported today, quoting an 
unidentified senior executive at an Internet company. The 
country’s central bank published rules on June 21 that allow 
companies other than banks to provide online payment services, 
excluding firms with foreign capital, the London-based paper 
said.  
 Alibaba owns Alipay, which controls 70 percent of the 
Chinese online payment market, according to the FT. Its 
unlisted parent counts Yahoo! Inc. and Softbank Corp. as its
biggest shareholders, the newspaper said. Tencent is partly 
owned by Naspers Ltd., the South African media group, according
to the report.
