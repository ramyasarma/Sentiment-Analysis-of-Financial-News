             Anadarko Petroleum Corp., the Texas
oil company that owns 25 percent of the damaged well pouring
crude into the Gulf of Mexico, was sued by investors who said
the company made false statements about drilling safety.  
 The proposed class-action, or group suit, filed today in
federal court in New York, alleges Anadarko misled investors
about the safety of the Deepwater Horizon joint venture and as a
result, investors lost money on news that the well couldn’t be
capped. The rig exploded on April 20, killing 11 workers.
