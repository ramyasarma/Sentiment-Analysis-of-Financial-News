             Lehman Brothers International Europe
asked a London court to decide whether parties on the other side
of swap agreements with the failed bank should have to pay if
they haven’t terminated the contracts.  
 If a party defaults, under the swap contract the other
isn’t required to keep making payments. LBIE had about 2,000
open swap transactions at the time it went into administration
in September 2008, its lawyer David Swanson said in a  court
filing  posted today on the website of LBIE administrator
 PricewaterhouseCoopers . Of those, at least 1,693 have been
closed.  
 “The joint administrators are concerned that certain
counterparties to derivatives transactions with LBIE may opt not
to close out the transactions under their ISDA Master Agreement
for a long period, or indefinitely,” PwC said in a statement
today referring to the contracts under rules established by the
 International Swap and Derivatives Association .  
 At least four counterparties have relied on the provision
“to avoid obligations that otherwise would have accrued and
will otherwise accrue to LBIE’s favor” under the agreements,
Swanson said.  
 The move is “depriving LBIE of an asset” that could be
distributed to its creditors, the administrators said in  court
papers .
