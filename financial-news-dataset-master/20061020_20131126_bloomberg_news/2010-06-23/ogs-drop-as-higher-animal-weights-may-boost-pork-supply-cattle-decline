             Hog futures fell for the first time
in four sessions on speculation that U.S. pork supplies will
increase as farmers sell animals at heavier weights. Cattle also
dropped.  
 Hogs in Iowa and southern Minnesota, the biggest U.S. pork-
producing region, weighed about 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms) more on
average last week than a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data showed today. Futures are selling at a premium
to the  spot market , which may spur farmers to hold hogs longer,
waiting for a higher price.  
 “It looks like the added weights have caught up with the
decreased supply,” said  Paul Beere , a market adviser at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin. “We’re
not seeing pounds of available product dropping the way that
we’d like to.”  
 Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.45 cent, or 0.5
percent, to 84.05 cents a pound at 12:06 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. During the previous three sessions, the
price climbed 2.9 percent. Before today, the most-active
contract gained 39 percent in the past year as U.S. producers
reduced herds.  
 Yesterday, wholesale pork was little changed at 84.28 cents
a pound, according to the USDA.  
 U.S. stockpiles of pork at the end of May totaled 448.3
million pounds, or 23 percent less than a year earlier, the USDA
said yesterday after livestock markets closed in Chicago. Two
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected a 25 percent drop,
on average.  
 Pork Supply  
 Pork supplies shrank 7.3 percent from May 2009, a smaller
decline than the five-year average of 8.4 percent, said  Dave Bauer , the president of Brite Futures Inc. in Milwaukee. The
report “is maybe an indication that we’ve slowed exports,”
Bauer said.  
 Cattle futures for August delivery declined 0.075 cent, or
0.1 percent, to 88.725 cents a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle
futures for August settlement rose 0.25 cent, or 0.2 percent, to
$1.12075 a pound.  
 Wholesale  choice beef  fell 0.3 percent at midday to $1.5413
a pound, down 10 percent from a 22-month high on May 11, USDA
data show. Domestic demand may be slumping as U.S. unemployment
remains high and consumers eat more pork and chicken, which are
cheaper, Beere said.
