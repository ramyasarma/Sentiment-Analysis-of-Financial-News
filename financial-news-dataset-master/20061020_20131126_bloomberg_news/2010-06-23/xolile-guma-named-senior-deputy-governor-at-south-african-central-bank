             South African President  Jacob Zuma 
named  Xolile Guma  as senior deputy governor at the Reserve Bank,
the latest in a number of changes at the top of the central bank
since Governor  Gill Marcus  came to office in November.  
 The appointment of 53-year-old Guma, who has been deputy
governor since July 2001, was effective from May 29, the central
bank said in a statement on its website today.  
 Zuma is yet to name a replacement for Deputy Governor
 Renosi Mokate , who won’t renew her five-year contract when it
expires on July 31.  Daniel Mminele  is the third deputy governor
at the bank, appointed to his position in June last year, before
former Governor  Tito Mboweni  left his position after two terms.  
 “The appointment recognizes Dr Guma’s experience and his
many years of valued service to the bank,” the Reserve Bank
said today.  
 Guma’s duties won’t change in his role as a senior deputy
governor, spokesman Hlengani Mathebula said in a phone interview
from Pretoria today.  
 The Reserve Bank on June 21 named Naidene Ford-Hoon as head
of its financial services department, replacing  Gerrie Terblanche , who retires at the end of the month. The financial
services head is also chief financial officer of the bank.  
 Mokate’s departure will leave a vacant seat on the seven-
member Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates.
Mboweni said in June last year the bank may appoint another MPC
member who is external to the central bank.
