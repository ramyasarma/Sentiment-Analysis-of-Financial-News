             Copper fell in New York before the
release of figures expected to signal a further weakening of the
housing market in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest user of
the metal.  
 Sales  of new homes in the country slid 19 percent in May,
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Sales of
previously owned U.S. houses unexpectedly dropped last month,
figures showed yesterday. Construction accounts for a quarter of
copper demand, according to the Copper Development Association.  
 “We are still trading on the back of the macroeconomic
news coming out, and the U.S. economic data is showing a
slowdown,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in
London, said by phone.  
 Futures for September delivery fell 1.85 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.992 a pound at 7:59 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The contract slid as much as 1.6 percent. Copper for
delivery in three months slipped 0.1 percent to $6,605 a metric
ton on the London Metal Exchange.  
 Comex prices will average $3.22 a pound this year, Morgan
Stanley said today in a report, 3 percent below its prior
estimate. The bank kept its 2011 forecast at $3.41.  
 “Lingering growth concerns in Europe and China are likely
to be a headwind for base metals” in the third quarter,  Peter Richardson , chief metals economist based in Melbourne, said in
the report. Still, the bank predicted “renewed relative and
absolute outperformance” from the fourth quarter into next
year.  
 House Purchases  
 The figures on U.S. new-home sales are due at 10 a.m.
Washington time. Sales dropped to a 410,000 annual rate,
according to the survey.  
 Purchases of existing houses, which make up about 90
percent of the market, slid 2.2 percent to a 5.66 million annual
rate, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed
yesterday. Economists had predicted a gain.  
 “Data continues to look gloomy, with existing-home sales
data failing to impress,”  David Thurtell , a Citigroup Inc.
analyst in London, said of the U.S. in a report yesterday.  
 Growth in Europe’s services and manufacturing industries
slowed in June, figures showed today. A composite index based on
a survey of euro-area purchasing managers in both industries
fell to 56 from 56.4 in May, Markit Economics said.  
 China’s removal of export rebates on some copper, zinc,
lead, nickel and tin products as of July 15, announced yesterday
by the Ministry of Finance, will have “limited impact on
demand,” Barclays Capital said today in a report. The country
is the biggest copper user.  
 Inventories Shrink  
 Stockpiles of copper tracked by the LME fell for a fourth
day to 456,425 tons, the lowest level since Dec. 8. Bookings to
remove metal from warehouses fell for a second day to 28,775
tons.  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME was 0.5
percent lower at $1,949.75 a ton. Global demand for primary
metal may almost double in the next decade on growth in China,
leading to a supply shortage of about 8 million tons, the Japan
Aluminium Association said today.  
 Nickel fell 0.3 percent to $19,600 a ton and zinc climbed
1.3 percent to $1,817 a ton. Lead slid 0.6 percent to $1,817 a
ton and tin dropped 1.7 percent to $17,850 a ton.
