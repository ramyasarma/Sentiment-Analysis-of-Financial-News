             Apple Inc. ’s iPhone 4 will
“dazzle” consumers with its thinner redesign, “radically”
sharper screen, higher-resolution front-facing camera and
updated operating system, reviewers said.  
 The iPhone 4 feels “denser and tighter” than the 3GS,
Wall Street Journal technology columnist  Walt Mossberg  wrote in
a review today. Sound is “much better on both ends” of a call,
according to  David Pogue  in the New York Times.  
 Mossberg called the phone a “major leap” over “its
already excellent predecessor.” Apple’s fourth-generation phone
goes on sale tomorrow at the same cost as the iPhone 3GS. The
16-gigabyte model sells for $199 and the 32-gigabyte model for
$299, each with a two-year contract from AT&T Inc.  
 Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has received more
than 600,000 preorders for the phone. Dallas-based AT&T, the
exclusive U.S. carrier for the iPhone, said June 15 that it has
booked 10 times as many preorders for the new model as it did
for the 3GS last year.  
 USA Today technology columnist  Edward C. Baig  said the
smartphone is “the one to beat, even as it faces fierce
competition from phones based on Google’s Android platform.”
Mossberg praised the video calling and long-lasting battery,
writing that “even in heavy use, the iPhone 4’s battery never
reached the red zone on a single day of my tests.”  
 Fewer Dropped Calls  
 Pogue wrote “the new phone is also better at choosing the
best channel for connecting with the cell tower,” leading to
fewer dropped calls in New York and San Francisco.  
 Baig, Mossberg and Pogue all presented the phone’s
drawbacks. The biggest is “Apple needs a second network,”
Mossberg said.  
 Apple also has allowed only certain applications to “fully
multitask” to avoid “a disastrous drain on battery life,”
Mossberg wrote. There are more than 225,000 applications that
run on the iPhone, according to an Apple  statement .  
 “The technically inclined may find greater flexibility and
choice among its Android rivals,” Pogue wrote. Baig added that
“critics are left with reasons to whine.”  
 The iPhone 4 “is still, overall, the best in its class,”
Mossberg wrote.  
 Apple fell $2.88 to $270.97 at 4:30 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have climbed 29 percent
this year and have more than doubled in the past year.
