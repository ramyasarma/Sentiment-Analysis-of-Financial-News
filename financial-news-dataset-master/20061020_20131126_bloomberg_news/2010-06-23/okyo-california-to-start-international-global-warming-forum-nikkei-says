             Tokyo’s Metropolitan Government and
the State of California plan to set up an international forum to
help tackle global warming, Nikkei English News reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  
 The forum, to be set up in autumn, will be open to cities
and countries looking to introduce rules on greenhouse gas
emissions, Nikkei said today. Both Tokyo and California have
passed stricter emission regulations than their national
governments, according to the report.  
 The two governments want to use the forum to pass on
technical and financial support on issues including energy
efficiency and renewable energy technology, Nikkei said. Tokyo
hopes the forum will help Japanese companies promote their
products, according to the report.
