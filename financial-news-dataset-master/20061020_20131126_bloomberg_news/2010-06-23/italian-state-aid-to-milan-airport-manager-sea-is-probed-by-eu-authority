             The European Union’s antitrust
agency will investigate state aid to Italian airport
groundhandling company SEA SpA, the European Commission said in
a statement today.  
 Italian airport authorities have absorbed the company’s
losses since 2002, and the commission “doubts whether the
compensation is compatible with EU state aid rules,” the
statement said.  
 A spokeswoman for Italy’s Transport Ministry declined to
comment. A SEA spokesman wasn’t immediately available to
comment.
