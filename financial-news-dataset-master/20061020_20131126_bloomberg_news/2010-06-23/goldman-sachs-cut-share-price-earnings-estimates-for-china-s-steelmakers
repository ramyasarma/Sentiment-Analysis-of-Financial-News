             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
12-month share-price estimates for four Chinese steelmakers by
as much as 32 percent to factor in the brokerage’s steel annd
iron ore price forecasts.  
 The brokerage also cut 2010 and 2011 earnings estimates for
Angang Steel Co.,  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. , Maanshan Iron and
Steel Co. and  Wuhan Iron & Steel Co.  by as much as 59 percent,
analysts led by  Jim Hung  wrote in a report.  
 The analysts maintained their “buy” recommendations on
 Angang  and Baosteel and retained their “neutral” ratings on
Wuhan and Maanshan, saying that Chinese steel prices and
equities tend to rebound earlier than regional peers. There may
be “room to add to positions” ahead of catalysts in the fourth
quarter, according to the report.
