             Roy Miller, the mischievous secret
agent played by  Tom Cruise  in “ Knight and Day ,” is a man of
many survival skills and many modes of transportation.  
 He crash lands a commercial jet in a Midwest cornfield
after wiping out a slew of onboard assassins. He blasts away at
bad guys while clinging to the hood of a speeding car in Boston.
He dodges bombs on a Caribbean island before escaping in a
helicopter and avoids charging bulls while racing a motorcycle
in Spain.  
 His globetrotting adventures with June ( Cameron Diaz ), an
unsuspecting woman he meets at the airport, provide a relatively
pleasing mix of action and comedy. “Knight and Day” isn’t a
great film or even a very good one, but it stands out against
dreadful summer competition like “The A-Team” and “Jonah
Hex.”  
 James Mangold ’s thriller, written by Patrick O’Neill,
borrows elements from “ North by Northwest ,” James Bond and
even Cruise’s own “Mission Impossible” series. Despite a
disorienting whirlwind of chase scenes and shootouts, I enjoyed
the comic interplay between Cruise and Diaz, who reunite for the
first time since the disastrous “ Vanilla Sky ” in 2001.  
 Roy is being chased by government agents, foreign spies and
arms dealers who want his prized possession -- a super-battery
that can power an entire city, invented by a geek (Paul Dano)
who’s also a target of the pursuers. No matter how hairy the
situation, Roy stays calm and cool. After both pilots on their
plane are killed, he matter-of-factly tells June that “it’s
just one of those things.”  
 Tunnel Ride  
 June is flying from Wichita, Kansas, to Boston for her
sister’s wedding when Miller shakes up her placid life as a
vintage-car restorer. After he plunges their plane into the
cornfield, she’s drawn into his dangerous, clandestine world,
where everyone is a potential enemy and gunfights are as common
as handshakes.  
 Roy’s boss ( Peter Sarsgaard ) tries to convince June that
her new friend is a rogue spy. But she sticks with him, even
though she keeps getting drugged by Roy and waking up in a new
place with no memory of how she got there.  
 Mangold (“Walk the Line,” “3:10 to Yuma”) offers
viewers a buffet of gut-churning thrills, including a roller-
coaster car ride through a tunnel and a rooftop chase in Austria
that ends with Roy plunging into a river. The main attraction,
though, is Cruise’s tongue-in-cheek performance. If he can laugh
at himself, why can’t we laugh with him?  
 “Knight and Day,” from 20th Century Fox, opens today
across the U.S. Rating: **1/2
