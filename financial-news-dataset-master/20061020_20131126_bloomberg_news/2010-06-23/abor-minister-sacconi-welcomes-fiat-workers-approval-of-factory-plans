             Italian Labor Minister Maurizio
Sacconi said he welcomed an agreement between workers at a Fiat
SpA factory in southern Italy and the carmaker concerning the
plant’s future.  
 “Now that the deal has been approved, the investment by
Fiat will be a logical consequence,” Sacconi told reporters in
Rome today.  
 Workers at the factory in Pomigliano, near Naples, voted 63
percent in favor of the plan, Ansa said today. The accord
between the company and all but one of the unions representing
its workers may pave the way for 700 million euros in
investments for the plant, setting it up to produce Fiat’s new
Panda model, Ansa said.
