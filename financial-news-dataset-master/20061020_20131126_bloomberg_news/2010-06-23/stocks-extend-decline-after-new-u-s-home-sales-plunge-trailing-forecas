             U.K. stocks fell, sending the FTSE
100 Index to a second day of losses, after U.S. new home sales
trailed forecasts.  
 The FTSE 100 declined 1.5 percent to 5,167.13 at 3:09 p.m.
in London.  
 Purchases of new homes in the U.S. fell in May to a record
low as a tax credit expired, showing the market remains
dependent on government support.
