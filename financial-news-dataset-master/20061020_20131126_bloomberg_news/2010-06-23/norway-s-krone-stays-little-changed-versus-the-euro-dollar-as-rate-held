             The Norwegian krone stayed little
changed versus the euro and dollar after the central bank kept
the main interest rate at 2 percent and said any increase will
happen later than “previously envisaged.”  
 The currency traded at 7.9386 per euro and 6.4719 per
dollar as of 2:08 p.m. in Oslo.
