             Deutsche Bank AG’s   Robert Karofsky ,
the New York-based co-head of equity sales and trading
worldwide, is taking a leave of absence for personal reasons,
effective immediately, bank spokesman  Ted Meyer  said.  
 Barry Bausano , 46, a prime brokerage executive also based
in New York, was appointed head of the equity unit in the
Americas, Meyer said, declining to comment further. Karofsky,
43, heads the global business with  Garth Ritchie  in London.  
 Anshu Jain , who oversees Deutsche Bank’s markets
businesses, has made U.S. equities a priority and is planning to
spend 1.6 billion euros ($1.96 billion) on hiring and technology
in the next two years to break into the top five in U.S. cash
equities and in commodities.  
 Karofsky was part of a group of eight traders Jain hired
from Morgan Stanley in 2005 to help boost Deutsche Bank’s market
share in U.S. stock trading. The firm advanced from 17th in 2004
to 7th place last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Karofsky, who had spent 14 years at Morgan Stanley, was
promoted to his current post, co-head of global markets equity,
in 2008.  
 Deutsche Bank had 2.73 billion euros of  net revenue  from
equity sales and trading in 2009, about 14 percent of the total
for the corporate and investment bank. Germany’s biggest bank
had a profit of 4.96 billion euros last year after a loss in
2008.  
 Bausano remains co-head of global prime finance in addition
to his new duties, Meyer said.
