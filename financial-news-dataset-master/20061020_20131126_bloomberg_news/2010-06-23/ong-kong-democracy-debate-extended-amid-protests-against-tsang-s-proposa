             Hong Kong’s  Legislative Council 
lawmakers approved a proposal today that will determine how the
chief executive is chosen in 2012. Lawmakers are continuing to
debate a package on how the lawmaking body’s members are chosen.  
 LegCo members voted 46-13 in favor of a motion that will
see the number of people who choose the chief executive
increased from 800 to 1200. The members of the so-called
Election Committee are appointees sanctioned by China.  
 Meanwhile the debate on LegCo’s future composition
continued for its second and final day for a proposal by Chief
Executive  Donald Tsang  on expanding its membership from 60 to 70.
The outcome of both votes will determine the pace of an
expansion of democracy in the territory.  
 Those who oppose the package say it does not provide a
clear roadmap to a one-man, one-vote system for Hong Kong.  
 “This package will lead Hong Kong to a false democracy,”
said Tanya Chan, one of five members of the Civic Party who
oppose the amendments. “In Hong Kong’s freakish system, the
chief executive is elected by a small circle of people,” she
said before the vote.  
 Others who oppose the package include Democratic lawmaker
 Andrew Cheng , who yesterday said he was quitting his party which
supports it, and Democratic party member James To who today
described it as “unacceptable.”  
 Even so, the government’s proposal is likely to win the
necessary two-thirds majority to pass, as it has the support of
most members of the Democratic Party, whose amendments to the
package the government accepted June 21.  
 The revised version proposes that the 10 new lawmakers on
the council are chosen by voters. Originally only five were to
be directly elected and five chosen by 405 directly elected
district councilors.  
 LegCo  now has 60 lawmakers, of whom 30 are chosen by
business groups and associations representing so-called
functional constituencies and 30 through direct election.  
 The pro-democracy Civic Party’s five lawmakers are calling
for universal suffrage in 2012, five years earlier than China
plans to let the public vote for the chief executive and eight
years before planned direct elections of all LegCo members. They
also seek the abolition of all functional-constituency seats,
which are given to groups such as bankers and businesses.  
 Lawmaker To said today the government’s measure will
entrench the system of functional constituencies.
