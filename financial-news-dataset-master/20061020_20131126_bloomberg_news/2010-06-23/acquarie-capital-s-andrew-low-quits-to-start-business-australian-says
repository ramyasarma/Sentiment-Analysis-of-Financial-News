             Macquarie Group Ltd. ’s Andrew  Low ,
chief operating officer of the investment banking division, quit
to start his own business, the Australian newspaper reported,
citing an internal memo to employees.  
 Low, who will begin an Asia-Pacific financial-services
company, will remain as a consultant to Macquarie Capital,
according to the newspaper, which cited a memo from  Michael Carapiet , the global head of investment banking.  
 Low’s departure follows those of  Jim Rossman , the U.S.
equity capital markets chief who quit last week, and  David Baron ,
Macquarie’s head of U.S. financial sponsors coverage. The
Sydney-based bank, which expanded its advisory business with
acquisitions including Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller
LLC last year, said in April that staff turnover among directors
had climbed.  
 Low, who ran Macquarie Capital in Asia for six years until
2009, was seen as Carapiet’s deputy, the Australian newspaper
reported.  Fiona Tyndall , a spokeswoman for Macquarie, the
country’s largest investment bank, declined to comment.  
 Macquarie today  fell  3.1 percent to A$42.67 in Sydney
trading. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 1.6 percent.
