             Slovakia’s Finance Ministry
estimates the state will collect about 1 billion euros ($1.2
billion) less revenue than planned this year,  Sme  reported
without saying where it got the information.  
 Lower tax revenue represents about 800 million euros of the
shortfall, with the rest stemming mainly from reduced income
from the state welfare system, the newspaper said.  
 In 2011, the ministry sees budget revenue falling short of
the target by 1.4 billion euros, Sme said. The ministry declined
to comment and plans to release the revenue forecast by next
week, the newspaper said.
