             When  AT&T Inc.  halted unlimited
wireless data plans this month, the company said 98 percent of
smartphone users would save money with its new pricing. The
savings may vanish for half its users by 2013, one analyst said.  
 The average customer will consume more than 2 gigabytes of
data a month within three years, up from 150 megabytes in 2009,
according to independent analyst Chetan Sharma. Though AT&T
could change its rates in the future, the cost of such data use
at current rates is $35 a month. That would make it more costly
than the $30 AT&T previously charged for unlimited data use.  
 With devices such as  Apple Inc. ’s iPhone and  HTC Corp. ’s
Evo offering more applications and faster downloads, phone users
are sucking up more data watching smoother YouTube videos and
“Iron Man” films.  
 “The devices are getting much, much better so the
opportunities to multitask are more attractive,” said Sharma,
who has written five books on mobile technologies and consulted
for companies such as  Motorola Inc.  and  Qualcomm Inc.   
 The new pricing plans may help boost AT&T’s revenue, as its
traditional landline voice business shrinks.  Wireless data
revenue  increased 30 percent in the first quarter, while
landline voice revenue fell 12 percent.  
 Mark Siegel , a spokesman for Dallas-based  AT&T , declined to
comment on the potential costs of its service in the future.  
 “The vast majority of users will benefit from our new
plans,” he said. “You can switch between plans even in the
middle of a month, and we let you know if you’re getting near
your plan limit.”  
 ‘Not Unreasonable’  
 Under AT&T’s new plans, users can select either a $15
monthly charge for 200 megabytes of data or a 2 gigabyte plan
for $25 per month, the carrier said. Users who exceed the 2-
gigabyte level pay an additional $10 per month for an additional
1 gigabyte of service.  
 It’s not only heavy data users who may be affected, Sharma
said. By year’s end, the average AT&T customer will have doubled
their data consumption from 2009 to 320 megabytes, according to
his estimates. Only 35 percent of AT&T’s smartphone customers
use 200 megabytes of data or more, the company said.  
 Sharma’s forecast that half of AT&T’s smartphone customers
will use more than 2 gigabytes of data is “not unreasonable,”
said  Christopher King , a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst in
Baltimore, though he said it’s difficult to predict such trends
because they depend on the introduction of new phones,
applications and wireless technologies.  
 Future Pricing  
 AT&T, the second-largest U.S. mobile-phone carrier, may
also adjust its prices in the future, potentially lowering costs
for heavy data users, said King.  
 “There’s no way that AT&T is going to maintain their tiered
pricing as they do today,” he said. “They’ll have to raise the
caps on data usage.”  
 Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile-phone carrier,
may follow AT&T in eliminating unlimited wireless data plans and
introducing tiered pricing,  John Killian , chief financial
officer of Verizon Communications Inc., said in an interview
last week.  Sprint Nextel Corp. , the third-largest U.S. wireless
carrier, said it has no immediate plans to change its pricing.  
 AT&T ’s pricing in the future will depend in part on how
rivals react to its new plans, Sharma said.  
 “Clearly AT&T will have to continuously monitor their own
network and potentially keep on adjusting these caps,” he said.

                          June 16 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said it logged more than 600,000 early orders for the iPhone 4 yesterday, a record, imposing a strain on computer systems that prompted carrier AT&T Inc. to suspend sales of the device before its June 24 debut. AT&T and Apple started accepting orders for the phone yesterday, with AT&T selling out all the preorders allocated for the device’s debut day. Bloomberg's Cris Valerio reports.
