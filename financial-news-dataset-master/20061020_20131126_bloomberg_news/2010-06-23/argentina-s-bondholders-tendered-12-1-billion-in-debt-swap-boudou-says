             The results of Argentina’s debt swap
offer exceeded the government’s expectations and will help close
a chapter in the country’s record $95 billion default in 2001,
Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  said.  
 Creditors holding about $12.1 billion of $18.3 billion in
defaulted debt tendered their securities in the restructuring,
which Boudou said was the result of “hard” negotiating on the
part of Argentina. Combined with the results of a 2005
restructuring, a total of 92.4 percent of the defaulted debt has
been swapped for a mix of new bonds, he said.  
 “It is the first time ever that a negotiation has been
done from the Argentine point of view and not the International
Monetary Fund or creditors point of view,” Boudou said during a
news conference in Buenos Aires.  
 Creditors holding defaulted bonds have blocked Argentina
from being able to tap international credit markets. Boudou has
said that a successful conclusion to the swap will allow South
America’s second-biggest economy to sell bonds, reduce borrowing
costs and attract investment. Turbulence in global financial
markets means those plans are on hold for now, Boudou said.  
 The government has no fiscal need to issue debt and can
wait until it is able to sell bonds that yield less than 10
percent, Boudou said.  
 Yields on the country’s benchmark dollar bonds due in 2015
rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 12.86 percent
at 10:59 a.m. New York time. The benchmark  Merval  stock index
fell 0.5 percent to 2,318.05.  
 “We’ve said from the beginning that we want to issue
bonds, but we know what’s going on in the world,” Boudou told
reporters. “We’re going to wait for the right time.”
