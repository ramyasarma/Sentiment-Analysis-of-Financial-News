             Germany “is the main protagonist”
in the euro’s crisis and risks inflicting deflation on the
European Union because of its insistence on budget austerity,
billionaire investor  George Soros  said.  
 “As the strongest and most creditworthy country it is in
the driver’s seat,” Soros said in a speech at Humboldt
University in Berlin yesterday. “As a result Germany
objectively determines the financial and macroeconomic policies
of the euro zone without being subjectively aware of it. When
all the member countries try to be like Germany they are bound
to send the euro zone into a deflationary spiral.”  
 European policy makers last month agreed on a loan package
that imposes budget rules on distressed euro-area members after
concern about Greece’s fiscal crisis undermined investor
confidence and pushed up borrowing costs across the region.
Governments in Spain, Italy and Portugal have all pledged to
step up deficit-cutting efforts.  
 “The euro is in crisis and Germany is the main
protagonist,” Soros said. “Unfortunately Germany does not
realize what it is doing. It has no desire to impose its will on
Europe; all it wants to do is to maintain its competitiveness
and avoid becoming the deep pocket to the rest of Europe.”  
 Chancellor  Angela Merkel  this week championed German export
strength as “the right thing” for her country, spurning
President  Barack Obama ’s call to boost private spending as both
leaders prepare for Group of 20 talks. Reducing Germany’s budget
deficit by 10 billion euros ($12 billion) per year “won’t put a
brake on the world’s economic growth,” Merkel said.  
 ‘Grave Accusation’  
 “By insisting on pro-cyclical policies, Germany is
endangering the European Union,” Soros said. “I realize that
this is a grave accusation but I am afraid it is justified. To
be sure, Germany cannot be blamed for wanting a strong currency
and a balanced budget but it can be blamed for imposing its
predilection on other countries that have different needs.”  
 Soros gained fame in the 1990s when he reportedly made $1
billion correctly betting against the British pound. He also
wagered that Germany’s mark would appreciate after the collapse
of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and that Japanese stocks would start
to fall in the same year.  
 Soros Fund Management LLC manages about $25 billion. Soros
said in April that “I’m no longer running the fund.”
