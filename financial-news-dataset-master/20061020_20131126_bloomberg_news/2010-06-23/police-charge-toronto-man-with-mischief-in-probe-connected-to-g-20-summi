             Police charged a Toronto man with
mischief and possession of explosives as part of an
investigation tied to the Group of 20 summit.  
 Byron Sonne, 37, also faces four other charges including
intimidation and possession of dangerous weapons, according to a
statement posted on the  Web site  of the G8-G20 Integrated
Security Unit. The charges came after Toronto Police Service
officers searched a home at 58 Elderwood Dr., about 7.7
kilometers (4.8 miles) north of the G-20 venue where world
leaders start gathering on June 26. Police said there was no
risk to public safety.  
 Separately, Toronto’s Queen’s Park  subway station  was
evacuated at 8:04 a.m. for about an hour while police
investigated a suspicious package, according to Jessica Martin,
a Toronto Transit Commission spokeswoman. Service on the Yonge-
University-Spadina line was halted between Union and St. George
stations.  
 The Emergency Task Force was called but the package
“turned out to be nothing,” a spokeswoman for the Integrated
Security Unit handling G-20 security told Canadian Press.
