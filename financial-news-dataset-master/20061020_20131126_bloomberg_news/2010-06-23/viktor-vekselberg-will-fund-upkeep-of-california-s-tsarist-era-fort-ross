                  June 23 (Bloomberg News) -- Billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg 
pledged funding to maintain a Californian park that Russia
established as a Pacific Ocean trading post in the 19th century.  
 Vekselberg’s Renova Group, a shareholder in BP Plc’s
Russian venture TNK-BP, will donate at least $1 million a year
to support Fort Ross, the billionaire said in San Francisco
after signing an accord with California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  on June 22.  
 Operating hours at Fort Ross have been slashed as
California struggles to stem its record budget deficit. Fort
Ross was established by the Russian-American Company, a
commercial hunting and trading venture chartered by the tsarist
government. Russians inhabited the fort from 1812 to 1841.  
 Vekselberg is part of a group of executives accompanying
President  Dmitry Medvedev  on a three-day visit to the U.S. The
Kremlin leader in March asked Vekselberg to oversee the creation
of a Russian version of Silicon Valley near Moscow.
