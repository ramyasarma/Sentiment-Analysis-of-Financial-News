             Billionaire investor  George Soros 
said continental European banks haven’t been “properly
cleansed” after the credit crisis because they haven’t marked
the value of their holdings to market prices.  
 “The current crisis is more a banking crisis than a fiscal
one,” Soros, 79, said in remarks prepared for a speech in
Berlin today. “Bad assets haven’t been marked to market, but
are being held to maturity. When markets started to doubt the
creditworthiness of sovereign debt it was really the solvency of
the banking system that was brought into question because the
banks were loaded with the bonds of the weaker countries and
these are now selling below par.”  
 Banks are struggling to get short-term funding because
the interbank lending and commercial paper markets have dried
up, he said. Firms have instead turned to the  European Central
Bank  for short-term financing and to deposit their excess cash,
Soros said.  
 European policy makers have pledged to publish the results
of stress tests on their banks in a bid to reassure investors.
Only the region’s 25 biggest banks will be examined, according
to  Andrew Lim , an analyst at Matrix Corporate Capital LLP. Bank
executives including Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer
Josef Ackermann have said publishing the tests could undermine
confidence in the banks unless governments promise aid.  
 “We cannot judge how serious the situation is until the
results are published,” Soros said today. “Indeed we shall not
be able to judge even then because the report will deal only
with the 25 largest banks and the biggest problems are in the
smaller banks, notably the Cajas in Spain and the Landesbanken
in Germany.”  
 Spanish, German Banks  
 Recapitalization of the smaller banks including Spain’s
savings banks and Germany’s state banks should be “compulsory”
because they are “way over-leveraged,” Soros said.  
 Hungarian-born Soros gained fame in the 1990s when he broke
the Bank of England’s defense of the pound and drove the
currency from Europe’s system of linked exchange rates. He also
successfully bet that Germany’s mark would rise after the
collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and that Japanese stocks
would start to fall in the same year.  
 Soros Fund Management LLC manages about $25 billion. The
executive said in April that he was no longer running the fund.
