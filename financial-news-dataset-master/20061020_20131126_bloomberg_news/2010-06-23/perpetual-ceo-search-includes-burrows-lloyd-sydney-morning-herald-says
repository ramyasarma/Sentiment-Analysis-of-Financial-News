             Perpetual Ltd. will consider
internal candidates Roger Burrows and Geoff Lloyd as it begins a
global search for a chief executive officer to replace David
Deverall, the Sydney Morning Herald reported without saying
where it got the information. The company is in “no rush” to
appoint a successor after Deverall gave 12 months notice of his
plan to leave, the newspaper reported.
