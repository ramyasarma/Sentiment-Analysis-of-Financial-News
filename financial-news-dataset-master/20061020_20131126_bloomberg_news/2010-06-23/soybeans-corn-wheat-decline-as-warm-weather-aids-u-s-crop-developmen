             Soybeans and corn declined in
Chicago as warmer weather in U.S. growing regions may aid crops
in the world’s largest exporter.  
 November-delivery soybeans fell 0.5 percent to $9.3175 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:27 p.m. London time.
Corn for December delivery dropped 0.3 percent to $3.7075 a
bushel, the third consecutive decline.  
 Hot weather in the Midwest will aid crop development,
while similar weather in the central and south Plains favors
maturing wheat crops, Telvent DTN Inc. said in a forecast
yesterday. The Midwest is the largest corn- and soybean-growing
region in the U.S.  
 “There’s a lot of focus on the weather in the U.S.,”  Toby Hassall , a research analyst at CWA Global Markets Pty, said by
phone from Sydney today. “The weather forecasts I’m seeing are
indicating a slightly more favorable outlook for the corn and
soybean crops.”  
 India is expected to plant more acreage with the oilseed
this year, boosting output, Religare Commodities Ltd. said today
in an e-mailed report. The nation, the world’s fifth-largest
soybean grower, will produce 8.8 million metric tons of soybeans
in the 2010-2011 season, up from 8.75 million tons a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts.  
 Still, drier weather in China’s corn-growing regions may
push the world’s second-largest consumer to boost imports,
potentially providing support to prices, Hassall said.  
 China Purchases  
 In northeast China, dry weather may persist through early
next week and continue to deplete soil moisture, increasing
stress on corn, soybean and spring-wheat crops, DTN said.  
 Wheat futures in Chicago rose 0.8 percent to $4.7975 a
bushel. Milling wheat futures for November delivery were
unchanged at 139.75 euros ($172) a ton in trading in Paris.  
 The dry weather “might lead to China requiring more U.S.
corn to satisfy their needs,” Hassall said. “There are some
supportive elements in the market at the moment, but from my
point of view, the main factor is what is looking like a record
large crop in the U.S.”  
 China has bought six cargoes of corn totaling 360,000 tons
from the U.S. in the past two weeks, bringing purchases to 16
cargoes, or almost 1 million tons, two executives familiar with
the transactions said.  
 The U.S. corn crop, the world’s largest, is  forecast  to
expand to a record 339.6 million tons in the 2010-11 marketing
year from 333 million tons a year earlier, according to
the USDA.  
 That will push the global stockpiles to 147.3 million tons
at the end of the season from 143.4 million a year
earlier, it said June 10.
