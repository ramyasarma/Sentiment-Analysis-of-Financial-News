             The University of Texas System,
which has the fifth-highest  endowment  among U.S. colleges, sold
$516.2 million in Build America Bonds as its flagship campus is
audited by the Internal Revenue Service.  
 The IRS is examining the University of Texas at Austin for
executive compensation and matters related to taxable income,
preliminary offering documents show.  Mack Brown , head football
coach, the highest-paid state employee at $5.1 million per year,
earns almost seven times more than  Francisco Cigarroa , who’s
paid $750,000 as chancellor of the University of Texas System.
By contrast, Texas Governor  Rick Perry  receives $150,000 a year.  
 Texas’s Build Americas maturing in 2030 were priced to
yield 5.09 percent, or 100 basis points over  30-year U.S.
Treasuries , with securities due in 2042 priced to yield 5.13
percent, or 104 basis points over the federal debt, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  
 “UT is one of the few natural AAAs out there,” said
 Regina Shafer,  who helps manage $5.2 billion in municipal assets
as assistant vice president of fixed income at USAA Investment
Management Co. in San Antonio. “With all the headlines this is
one the few you can buy and still sleep at night.”  
 The university system is rated higher than the state, which
was awarded AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and Aaa from Moody’s
Investors Service.  
 The system’s only other Build America sale was a $330.6
million issue in June 2009. Securities due in 2041 were priced
to yield 6.28 percent, 152 basis points above 30-year
Treasuries, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Average Yield  
 The debt traded at an average yield of 5.4 percent on June
21, according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data.
That’s 123 basis points above government debt, and 61 basis
points above top-rated  Microsoft Corp.  bonds maturing in 2039,
which traded at 4.77 percent the same day.  
 The university system “doesn’t trade on the AAA level,
generally comes 15 to 20 basis points behind the AAA,” said
 Dexter Torres , a trader with New York-based Samson Capital
Advisors LLC. “The market requires a little bit of spread even
though it’s AAA.”  
 Michigan State University and the  California State
University  each sold $205 million in Build America debt this
year. California’s March sale, rated Aa3 by Moody’s the fourth-
highest level, had bonds to be redeemed in 2041 priced to yield
6.48 percent, 191 basis points above Treasuries. The second-
biggest tranche, maturing in 2030, priced at 6.43 percent, or
186 basis points above the benchmark Treasury. It traded on June
16 at an average yield of 6.23 percent, or 205 basis points over
Treasuries.  
 Michigan State’s April issue, rated Aa2, third-highest,
yielded 6.17 percent for securities due in 2050. That’s 150
basis points above government debt.  
 IRS Questionnaires  
 The IRS mailed  questionnaires  to 400 nonprofit colleges and
universities in October 2008, seeking data on endowments,
compensation and income from businesses unrelated to their
missions of teaching and research. It picked more than 30
institutions to audit on the basis of answers and is reviewing
an additional 13 that failed to respond, the agency said.  
 The city of Austin, Texas, the site of the university’s
flagship campus, had $617,284 in Build America subsidy withheld
by the IRS in February amid a dispute over payroll taxes. The
city still owes $35,000 that may be withheld from a subsidy for
a Sept. 1 payment.  
 “I think the whole IRS issue and the reimbursement issue
have cooled people off on BABS,” said  Matt Dalton , chief
executive officer of Belle Haven Investments Inc. in White
Plains, New York. “I think you might expect that.”  
 Build Americas  
 Build America Bonds, created last year as part of the
economic stimulus program, are the fastest-growing part of the
$2.8 trillion municipal market. Issuers are eligible for a 35
percent subsidy on interest rate costs from the U.S. Treasury.
About $114 billion of the securities have been sold, Bloomberg
data show.  
 The university’s offering comes as the future of the
program, which is set to expire in December, is still
undetermined. A two-year extension is included in a jobs bill
currently being debated in the U.S. Senate. Passed by the House
of Representatives May 28, the provision would cut federal
subsidies to borrowers to 32 percent in 2011 and 30 percent in
2012.
