             Abengoa SA , an operator of solar-
power plants in Spain, climbed in Madrid trading after a news
report said the government dropped plans to cut subsidized rates
earned by those electricity generators.  
 Shares of the Seville, Spain-based engineering company rose
as much as 7.5 percent and traded at 17.85 euros, up 6.1
percent, at 10:55 a.m. local time. By contrast the  IBEX 35 ,
Spain’s benchmark stock index, was 0.6 percent lower.  
 Solaria Energia & Medio Ambiente SA, which also builds
plants using photovoltaic panels to generate power, increased
4.4 percent to 1.79 euros in Madrid.  
 Iberdrola Renovables SA , Spain’s largest alternative-energy
producer, rose 1.1 percent to 2.77 euros.  
 Spanish Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  decided
the rate reductions planned by the government only will apply to
future renewable-energy projects, the newspaper Cinco Dias
reported today, citing people close to the government it didn’t
identify by name.  
 Industry Ministry officials declined to comment to
Bloomberg News on the report, according to a spokesman who asked
not to be identified, citing department policy.
