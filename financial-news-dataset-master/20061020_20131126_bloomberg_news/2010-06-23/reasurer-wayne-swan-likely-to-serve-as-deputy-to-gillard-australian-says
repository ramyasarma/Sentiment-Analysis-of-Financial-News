             Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan is
the likely candidate for deputy if Julia Gillard’s challenge to
Kevin Rudd’s prime ministership is successful, the Australian
newspaper reported on its website, citing Labor party sources.
Swan’s elevation would pave the way for Finance Minister Lindsay
Tanner to move into the Treasurer’s portfolio with the
leadership ballot scheduled for 9 a.m. in Canberra, the
newspaper reported.
