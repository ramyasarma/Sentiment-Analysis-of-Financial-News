             Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development
Co., Saudi Arabia’s biggest property company by market value,
exchanged half of its $450 million fixed-rate Islamic bond as it
seeks to cut borrowing costs.  
 The company swapped $225 million into floating-rate notes,
reducing the profit it pays on the five-year sukuk to 7.95
percent more than the  three-month Saudi interbank offered rate ,
according to a statement to the Dubai bourse today. The notes
paid a coupon of 10.75 percent when they were sold in February.  
 “This transaction comes in line with the company’s
strategy to reduce its cost of financing by benefiting from the
current available lower variable rates,” the company said.  
 Saudi Arabia’s average three-month interbank rate has
declined 5 basis points since the beginning of February to
0.72575 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dar Al
Arkan Real said in April first-quarter profit fell 6.1 percent
on a “slight decline in profit margins” from property sales.  
 The sukuk rose 0.2 percent to 99.583 cents on the dollar at
4:55 p.m. in Riyadh today, yielding 10.859 percent.  
 Dar Al Arkan didn’t say who they signed an agreement with.
