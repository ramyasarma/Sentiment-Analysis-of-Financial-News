             Britain’s  Competition Commission 
didn’t show bias by trying to force Heathrow owner BAA Ltd. to
sell three other U.K. airports by spring 2011, the regulator
told the Court of Appeal in London.  
 The watchdog is seeking to overturn a decision last year
that blocked its attempt to make BAA sell two other London
airports and either the Glasgow or Edinburgh airports to boost
competition. The lower court found the regulator’s demand flawed
because one of its advisors was linked to a group that
considered buying BAA assets. Madrid-based  Ferrovial SA  now owns
BAA.  
 “It isn’t that they misused the law, but they misapplied
it,”  Jonathan Sumption , the regulator’s lawyer said of the
lower court judges at today’s hearing. “They were far more
suspicious than any fair-minded observer would have been.”  
 The Competition Appeal Tribunal in December upheld BAA’s
claim the advisory panel member,  Peter Moizer , didn’t recuse
himself early enough in the process.  
 The ruling came after BAA, under pressure from the
commission, sold Gatwick airport in London to Global
Infrastructure Partners Ltd. for 1.51 billion pounds ($2.25
billion). Moizer also advised a pension fund that invests money
for local authorities that control Manchester Airports Group,
which had considered bidding on some BAA properties.
