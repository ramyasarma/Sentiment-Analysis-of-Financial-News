             The pound extended its advance
against the dollar after the Bank of England said the Monetary
Policy Committee was not unanimous in its decision to hold rates
at 0.5 percent.  
 The pound rose 0.5 percent to $1.4895 as of 9:37 a.m. in
London, and strengthened 0.3 percent to 82.57 pence.  
 The Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-1 to keep the
benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, according to minutes of
the June 10 decision released in London today. Sentance favored
an increase to 0.75 percent, arguing that inflation was proving
to be “resilient” after the recession.
