             Fannie Mae , the mortgage guarantor
80 percent  owned  by the U.S. government, will temporarily deny
new loans to borrowers who deliberately default and walk away
from their homes.  
 Borrowers who have the means to make mortgage payments and
don’t work with lenders to restructure loans will be banned from
obtaining new mortgages backed by Fannie Mae for seven years
from the date of foreclosure, the company said today in a
statement. Washington-based Fannie Mae, along with McLean,
Virginia-based rival Freddie Mac, own or guarantee more than
half of the $10.7 trillion U.S. mortgage market.  
 “Walking away from a mortgage is bad for borrowers and bad
for communities,”  Terence Edwards , Fannie Mae’s executive vice
president for credit portfolio management, said in the
statement. “Our approach is meant to deter the disturbing trend
toward strategic defaulting,” he said, adding that the firm
will take legal action against borrowers who use the tactic.  
 Homeowners walking away from mortgages they can afford
accounted for about 12 percent of U.S. mortgage defaults in
February, New York-based Morgan Stanley said in an April report.
Borrowers with bigger loans and higher credit scores were more
likely to stop paying when they were underwater, or carried
mortgages exceeding their property’s value, the report found.  
 More than 23 percent of all single-family homes were
underwater at the end of March, up from 21 percent at the end of
December, according to Seattle-based Zillow.com.
