             India has introduced a tender
process for legal advice on its 400 billion rupees ($8.6 billion)
asset sale program that allows more law firms to participate,
Disinvestment Secretary  Sumit Bose  said.  
 India’s top 15-ranked firms for fund raising in the
previous quarter are now invited to pitch for a role in new
share sales, the official in charge of the program said in a
June 18 interview.  
 “We are drawing up a list of the top law firms based on
league tables and inviting them to tender,” Bose said. “The
change we have brought about is to make the process dynamic.”  
 Jurisprudent Consulting Partners and Axon Partners LLP,
which have less than 15 lawyers, joined Amarchand & Mangaldas &
Suresh A. Shroff & Co., India’s  top ranked capital markets  law
firm by volume, in the tender for Engineers India Ltd., the
first share sale to use the new process.  
 Luthra & Luthra Law Offices, which managed 28 percent of
share and debt sales in the year ended March 31, according to
 Prime Database , won with a 13.6 million rupee bid in partnership
with DLA Piper LLP, according to two people involved in the
transaction. That would be equivalent to 0.11 to 0.12 percent of
the total issue size.  
 “The process in the fresh round of disinvestments for
shortlisting law firms was fairly transparent and detailed,”
said Luthra & Luthra capital markets head and partner Madhurima
Mukherjee.  
 “Law firms were invited and judged on objective parameters
such as the firms’ capital market experience, profiles and
experience of indidivuals, after which they considered the
financial bids,” she said.  
 ‘Niche Law Firms’  
 The Indian government will sell 33.7 million shares, or a
10 percent stake in the  company . ICICI Securities Ltd., HSBC
Securities & Capital Markets (India) Pvt., IDFC Capital Ltd. and
SBI Capital Markets Ltd. are managing the sale.  
 Luthra & Luthra also won the bidding to handle the share
sale of Coal India Ltd. Amarchand & Mangaldas’ Co-Managing
Partner  Shardul Shroff  didn’t respond to e-mails and phone calls
requesting comment.  
 The government is revamping its asset sale program
including paying fees to brokers who sell stock in the state-run
companies after individual investors shunned offerings this year.  
 “The process is being run very well,” said Abhimanyu
Bhandari, co-founder of Axon Partners. “I hope that going
forward niche and small law firms who make it to the league
tables are also given a chance.”
