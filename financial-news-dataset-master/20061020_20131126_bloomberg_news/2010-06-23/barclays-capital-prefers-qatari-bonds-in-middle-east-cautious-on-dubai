             Qatar’s long-term bonds are the best
bet for investors because the gas-rich state’s strong finances
will likely contain any spillover from the euro debt crisis,
Barclays Capital said.  
 “We see more upside potential for Qatar here and would
recommend overweighting Qatar versus Abu Dhabi,” analysts
 Andreas Kolbe  and  Alia Moubayed  said in a note sent by e-mail
today. “We continue to see Qatar as the fundamentally strongest
credit in the region and see value in the longer-dated bonds in
particular.”  
 Qatar is the world’s largest producer of liquefied natural
gas. The yield on Qatar’s 6.55 percent, fixed-rate bond maturing
in 2019 has fallen 112 basis points to 4.643 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg bond trader composite prices.  
 Barclays Capital said it’s “cautious” on Dubai sovereign
credit because of the uncertainty surrounding the restructuring
of state-owned Dubai World. “Investors will need greater clarity
about potential liabilities for the Dubai sovereign stemming
from the Dubai World restructuring before a more positive stance
towards the sovereign credit can be justified,”  the investment
banking unit of Barclays Plc said.  
 Dubai World, one of the emirate’s three main business
groups, last month said its main creditor group agreed to
restructure $14.4 billion of bank loans and $8.9 billion of
government liabilities as it seeks to resolve a debt crisis that
roiled global markets last year. Dubai had to borrow $20 billion
from Abu Dhabi to help state-owned companies pay debt.
