             Japan’s Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  wants to raise taxes for higher earners to narrow the gap
between rich and poor, the Wall Street Journal  reported , citing
an interview.  
 Japan’s tax policy should be guided by “egalitarian
thinking” and reform will be aimed at “income
redistribution,” Noda told the newspaper. The government’s tax
panel will discuss changes to the system after parliamentary
elections on July 11, the report said.  
 Noda’s remarks suggest the government may be planning an
overhaul of Japan’s tax system that goes beyond raising the
consumption tax, according to the newspaper. Japan’s Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  wants to double the consumption tax to 10
percent in the next few years.
