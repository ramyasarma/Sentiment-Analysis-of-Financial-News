             The Group of 20 nations may call for
“voluntary” measures to lower government handouts for oil and
coal to help reduce global carbon-dioxide emissions when they
meet this week in Toronto, according to a draft proposal.  
 The document, dated June 11, was obtained by Bloomberg News
from the environmental group Greenpeace, which will follow the
Toronto talks. The voluntary-measure call is a step back from a
G20 meeting last year in Pittsburgh where leaders proposed
phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies, conservationists said.  
 “This is disappointing,” said  Jake Schmidt , climate
policy director for the New York-based Natural Resources Defense
Council. “It’s a draft and no one knows what will come out
during the final hours but normally you wouldn’t start with such
a weak position.”  
 Stopping aid by 2020 would reduce global oil demand by 6.5
million barrels a day, or about a third of the current U.S. use,
according to a study by the International Energy Agency.
Subsidies that promote consumption, such as below-market
gasoline prices, totaled $557 billion in 2008.  
 Leaders from G20 nations including the U.S., China and
Germany are meeting this weekend in Toronto to discuss trade,
economic growth and development.
