             More than 375 flights have been
canceled at Chicago’s O’Hare airport, the second-busiest in the
U.S., because of local thunderstorms.  
 Arrivals and departures  are being delayed an hour or more,
the Chicago Department of Aviation said in an e-mailed statement
today. Chicago Midway Airport is also experiencing delays of
about 45 minutes, the city said.  
 UAL Corp.’s  United Airlines and  AMR Corp.’s  American
Airlines are the biggest carriers at O’Hare, and along with
their regional partners account for about two-thirds of service
at the airport. United had about 135 cancellations at O’Hare
today, spokeswoman Sarah Massier said. American scrubbed about
114 flights there, spokeswoman  Andrea Huguely  said.  
 O’Hare handled 64 million passengers last year, trailing
only  Delta Air Lines Inc.’s  hub at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta
International Airport, which had 88 million, according to
Airports Council International.  
 Southwest Airlines Co.  is the biggest carrier at Chicago
Midway, with about 85 percent of service, according to
government data.  
 The weather system is moving east across Michigan and
affecting Delta’s Detroit hub, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration’s website.  
 O’Hare, Midway and Detroit all have “ground stop”
programs in place, which hold some aircraft at their departure
point so they don’t have to divert around storms later, the FAA
site showed.
