             Canadian Environment Minister  Jim Prentice  announced the country will phase in greenhouse-gas
emissions standards for coal-powered energy facilities to give
the industry time to adopt cleaner technologies.  
 The government will mandate that traditional coal-fired
plants either meet new standards that will be announced next
year, or close once they reach the end of their “economic
life,” Prentice said today in Ottawa. Thirty-three of Canada’s
51 coal-burning units will reach the end of their economic life
by 2025, he said.  
 “A responsible, clear phase-out of the electricity
sector’s inefficient coal-fired generation will allow ample time
for the implementation of clean generation technologies,”
Prentice said in a statement.  
 The rules will take effect on July 1, 2015, and draft
regulations will be published early next year, Prentice said.
The new standards will be based on bringing coal plants to
“parity” with the emissions performance of high-efficiency
natural gas generation, he said.  
 New regulations are part of Canada’s response to the
Copenhagen accord on greenhouse-gas emissions. Prentice
announced new rules for truck emissions last month and
harmonized the country’s automobile regulations with those of
the U.S. in April.  
 Because it relies less on coal for electricity than the
U.S. and its plants will need to be replaced sooner, Canada is
setting its own rules instead of harmonizing with those of its
southern neighbor, Prentice said in a June 15 speech.
