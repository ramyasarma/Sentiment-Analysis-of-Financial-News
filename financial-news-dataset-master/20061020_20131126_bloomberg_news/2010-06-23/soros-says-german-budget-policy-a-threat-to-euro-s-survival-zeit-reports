             Billionaire investor  George Soros 
said German fiscal policy endangers the European currency union,
Die Zeit reported, citing an interview.  
 “The German policy is a danger for Europe, it could
destroy the European project,” Soros was quoted as saying. “If
the Germans do not change their policy, their exit from the
currency union would be helpful for the rest of Europe,” he
added, according to the report.  
 Soros also said that one “can’t rule out a collapse of the
euro,” Die Zeit said.
