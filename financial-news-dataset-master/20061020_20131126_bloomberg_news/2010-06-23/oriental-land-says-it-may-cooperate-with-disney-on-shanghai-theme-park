             Oriental Land Co. , operator of
the Tokyo Disney Resort, said it may cooperate with Walt
Disney Co. on a planned Shanghai theme park.  
 “There’s a possibility we may work together with Disney
on Shanghai,”  Akiyoshi Yokota , executive director, said in
an interview at the company’s headquarters in Chiba
prefecture, a Tokyo suburb. No details on cooperation were
decided, he said.  
 Oriental Land has been talking about the planned theme
park and exchanging information with  Disney , Yokota said,
without elaborating. Disney last year won Chinese government
approval for a park in Shanghai that may be completed by 2014.  
 The Japanese theme park operator, aiming to post a
record  profit  for the second straight year, is looking to
expand its business outside Japan while trying to attract
tourists from China and other countries, as domestic
customers spend less amid falling wages.  
 Oriental Land  gained  0.3 percent to 7,380 yen at 1:08
p.m. in Tokyo trading, 50 yen below the 7,430 yen reached on
June 21, the highest since Jan. 5, 2009. The benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average today sank 1.7 percent.  
 Net income will probably rise 1.6 percent to 25.8
billion yen ($285 million) for the year ending March 31,
Oriental Land said in May. Sales may decline 4 percent to
356.6 billion yen.  
 The company’s Disney resort includes Disneyland,
DisneySea and Disney Ambassador Hotel.  
 Walt Disney Co. (Japan) Ltd. acquired Retail Networks
Co., operator of Disney retail stores in Japan, from Oriental
Land in March, the Japanese company said in May. Oriental
Land pays royalties to Disney to operate its theme parks.
