             F.O. Licht raised its forecast for
world sugar production for the 2009-10 season by 0.7 percent on
higher output from Brazil and India.  
 Global output will be 155 million metric tons for the year
through September, up from a February prediction of 153.9
million tons, Ratzeburg, Germany-based F.O. Licht said in a
statement today. The research company expects demand to rise
next year, and didn’t provide any forecast.  
 “There are indications that Brazilian output will rise
significantly in 2010/11,” while improved weather and better
crop care can be expected to result in a “sizeable rise” in
Indian output, Licht said.  
 The sugar market can be expected to swing back into a
surplus in 2010-11, according to the report, which added that
the surplus won’t be “burdensome” given that demand worldwide
has stayed strong throughout the global economic crisis since
2008.
