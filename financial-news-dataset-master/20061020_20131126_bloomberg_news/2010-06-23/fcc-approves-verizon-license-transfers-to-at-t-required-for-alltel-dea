             Verizon Wireless  may complete the
last required divestitures from its 2009 purchase of  Alltel
Corp.  by selling 79 mobile-telephone service licenses to AT&T
Inc., the Federal Communications Commission said.  
 The transfers, mainly in the western United States, were
approved by the FCC in an  order  posted yesterday on its website.
The $28.1 billion acquisition made Verizon Wireless the biggest
U.S. provider of mobile-phone service.  
 The transfers to AT&T, the second-largest mobile-service
provider, “will promote competition and provide consumers with
additional wireless services in a number of markets,” the FCC
said.  
 The order “takes an important step to help restore at
least some level of competitive balance,” FCC Commissioner
 Michael Copps  said in a statement on the agency’s website.  
 Verizon Wireless, based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, is
owned by  Verizon Communications Inc.  and  Vodafone Group Plc .
