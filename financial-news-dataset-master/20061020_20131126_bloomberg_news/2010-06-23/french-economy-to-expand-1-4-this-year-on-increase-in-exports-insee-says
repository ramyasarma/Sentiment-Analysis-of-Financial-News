             France’s economy will expand 1.4
percent this year as a pickup in exports in the first half
begins to spill over into domestic demand, national statistics
office Insee predicted.  
 Growth  will accelerate to 0.5 percent in the second quarter
from 0.1 percent in the first, then hold at 0.4 percent in the
third and fourth quarters, the Paris-based agency said late
yesterday in a semi-annual report.  
 While the economy has grown for four straight quarters
after France’s worst slump in six decades, the recovery remains
fragile as President  Nicolas Sarkozy  phases out fiscal-stimulus
measures. Gains so far have been led by improving world trade,
though with unemployment stabilizing, household spending should
begin to recover in the second half, Insee said.  
 “What helped the economy early in the year was trade,”
Insee economist Sandrine Duchene told journalists. “The
recovery is taking hold.”  
 The French economy will create 63,000 new  jobs  this year
after losing 255,000 last year, Insee predicted. The
unemployment rate will remain unchanged at 9.9 percent, it said.
