             Purchases of new U.S. houses plunged
in May by the most in 16 years after a tax credit expired,
economists said before a report today.  
 New-home  sales , tabulated on contract signings, fell 19
percent to an annual pace of 410,000 last month, according to
the  median  estimate of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
In order to qualify for a government incentive worth up to
$8,000, a purchase agreement had to be signed by April 30.  
 The end of the tax advantage means the  market  will cool
until employment picks up enough to lift incomes, brace
confidence and contain foreclosures. A lack of inflation and
concern over jobs and housing are among reasons Federal Reserve
policy makers today may reiterate a pledge to keep interest
rates near zero in coming months.  
 “The housing market will be much weaker in the absence of
the tax credit,” said  Harm Bandholz , chief U.S. economist at
UniCredit Group in New York. “Building activity is needed to
support the economic recovery and that isn’t going to pick up
for quite some time. The Fed is in no hurry to raise rates.”  
 The Commerce Department’s report is due at 10 a.m. in
Washington. Economists’ forecasts ranged from 300,000 to
530,000, after a 504,000 rate in April. Last month’s projected
drop would be the biggest since January 1994.  
 A report yesterday showed sales of previously owned homes
unexpectedly fell in May, raising the risk the retrenchment
following the end of the tax incentive will be deeper than
anticipated.  Existing house purchases , calculated when a
contract closes, dropped 2.2 percent to a 5.66 million annual
rate, the National Association of Realtors said.  
 Timely Gauge  
 New-home sales are considered a timelier barometer of the
market than purchases of previously owned homes, which account
for about 90 percent of the housing market.  
 Other data show the market is starting to stumble. Housing
 starts  in May declined by the most since March 2009, and
building permits, a sign of future construction, fell to a one-
year low, figures from the Commerce Department showed. The
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo  confidence
index  for June fell by the most since November 2008.  
 The number of mortgage applications filed to purchase
houses dropped this month to the lowest level since 1997,
according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.  
 The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilder  Index ,
which includes  Toll Brothers Inc.  and Lennar Corp., has dropped
28 percent since reaching a 19-month high on May 3. The broader
S&P 500 Index is down 10 percent from the 19-month peak on April
23.  
 Builder Concerns  
 Builders are also concerned that the Gulf oil spill and
European debt crisis are hurting buyer confidence. Toll
Brothers, the largest U.S. luxury homebuilder, said deposits
have been running 20 percent behind the year-earlier period the
past three weeks.  
 “Concerns about the financial crisis in Europe and
escalating regional political tensions, coupled with worries
about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its effects on the
economy and the environment have negatively impacted the outlook
of American consumers,”  Joel H. Rassman , chief financial
officer at Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll Brothers, said in a
June 16 statement.  
 Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. , the largest homebuilder in New
Jersey, said orders fell 17 percent in the quarter ended April
30 from a year earlier, and contract signings slowed in May,
indicating the tax credit helped pull some sales forward.
