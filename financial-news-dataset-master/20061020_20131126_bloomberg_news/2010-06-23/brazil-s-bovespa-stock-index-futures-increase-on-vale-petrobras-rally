             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock-index futures
rose after  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  said it will delay until
September the sale of as much as $25 billion of stock.  
 Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil company is
known, gained in U.S. trading after saying late yesterday that
the offering, originally planned for July, will be delayed
because a price hasn’t been set in a related deal to buy oil
reserves from the government.  Vale SA , the world’s biggest iron
ore producer, advanced after Morgan Stanley said prices for the
steel-making ingredient will rise 12.4 percent next year after
almost doubling this year.  
 Bovespa stock-index futures climbed 0.4 percent to 65,950
at 8:30 a.m. New York time. The real fell 0.1 percent to 1.7898
per dollar, from 1.7880 yesterday.  
 Iron ore prices will increase in 2011 after a 93.5 percent
jump this year supported by demand for steel in China, emerging
and developed markets, Morgan Stanley said. Iron ore will
average $126.70 a metric ton in 2011, from $112.70 a ton this
year, analyst  Peter Richardson  wrote in a report dated today.  
 Petrobras’s offering is tied to an agreement to buy rights
to as much as 5 billion barrels of oil from the government with
stock. Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro, said in a statement
late yesterday industry regulators will assess the value of such
reserves by the end of August.  
 Cosan SA Industria & Comercio may be active after O Estado
de S. Paulo reported that it will sell 1 billion reais ($558.7
million) worth of ethanol to petrochemicals producer Braskem SA
over the next five years for plastics production.
