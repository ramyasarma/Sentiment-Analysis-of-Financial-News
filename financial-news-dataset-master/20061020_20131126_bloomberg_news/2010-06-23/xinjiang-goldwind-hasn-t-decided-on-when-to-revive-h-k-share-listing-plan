             Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. hasn’t decided on when it will revive a plan to
sell shares, spokesman Thomas Yao said by phone today.  
 “Under such market conditions, there’s no way we can
determine when, how or where we may list,” he said when
contacted on his mobile phone. “The situation is as per what
the company has announced,” he said.  
 The company shelved a plan to raise as much as HK$9.09
billion ($1.2 billion) in a share sale in Hong Kong, citing poor
market conditions, according to a June 14 statement.
