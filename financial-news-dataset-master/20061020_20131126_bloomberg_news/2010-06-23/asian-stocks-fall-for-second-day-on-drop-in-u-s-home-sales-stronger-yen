             Asian stocks  fell, dragging the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to its biggest drop in two weeks, after an
unexpected decline in U.S. home sales raised concern about the
strength of the world’s largest economy.  
 Toyota Motor Corp. , which receives 67 percent of its
revenue outside Japan, slid 1.7 percent in Tokyo after the
dollar and euro weakened against the yen.  Nintendo Co. , which
counts the Americas and Europe as its biggest markets, dropped
3.1 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s No. 1 mining company,
lost 1.3 percent in Sydney after oil and copper prices sank.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  fell 1.1 percent to 116.86 at
1:25 p.m. in Tokyo, the most since June 7. The measure has
fallen 9.5 percent from its high this year on April 15 on
speculation Chinese measures to curb property prices and
Europe’s debt crisis will hurt global growth.  
 “Investors are avoiding risk because concern is emerging
that the global economy will slow,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a
fund manager in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $6 billion. “This isn’t the right time to draw
up an investment strategy.”  
 Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 1.7 percent, the
biggest decline among major indexes in the Asia-Pacific region.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 1.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index slipped 0.5 percent while China’s Shanghai Composite
Index decreased 0.9 percent.  
 Export Revenue  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.3 percent.
The gauge dropped 1.6 percent yesterday, the most since June 4,
after the National Association of Realtors said purchases of
existing houses decreased to a 5.66 million annual rate. Sales
were forecast to rise to a 6.12 million rate, according to the
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, fell 1.7 percent to
3,220 yen and was the biggest drag on the  MSCI Asia Pacific
Index . Nintendo, the world’s No. 1 maker of portable video-game
players, dropped 3.1 percent to 27,430 yen.  Sony Corp. , which
receives 42 percent of its sales from the U.S. and Europe,
declined 1 percent to 2,511 yen.  
 The housing data caught some investors off guard amid
recent optimism for a pick-up in global growth that has driven
the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  up by 7.6 percent from this year’s
low on May 25. A Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index on
June 11 pointed to improved sentiment among U.S. consumers.
Manufacturing in the New York region grew at a faster pace in
June, according to Federal Reserve data on June 15.  
 Biggest Declines  
 China announcing the end of its currency’s peg to the
dollar on June 19 also boosted sentiment. The average price of
shares in the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has risen to 14.6 times
estimated  earnings  from 13.8 times on May 18, the lowest level
in almost 17 months.  
 Japanese exporters also declined today as the stronger yen
threatened to reduce the value of overseas sales when
repatriated. The dollar weakened to as low as 90.37 yen today
from 90.81 at yesterday’s close of stock trading in Tokyo. The
euro depreciated to 110.78 yen from 111.61.  
 Gauges of technology, consumer and material stocks in the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped more than 1.3 percent today, the
most of 10  industry  groups.  
 The main MSCI measure lost 0.8 percent yesterday, snapping
an eight-day advance that was the longest winning streak since
July 2009. In trading on June 21, the index rose close to its
200-day moving average of 119.57, the first time since May 14,
before falling in the last two days.  
 Fragile Sentiment  
 “Technically speaking, that will now be the resistance
level for the market and there would have to be something
significant to break through that,” said  Andrew Sullivan , a
sales trader at MainFirst Securities Hong Kong Ltd. “Eyes are
on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting to see whether the
sentiment there is encouraging or not, as that is obviously
something that is causing a lot of weakness in the Asian
markets.”  
 The Federal Reserve committee ends a policy meeting and is
due to release a statement later today. Officials after the last
meeting on April 28 restated their intention to keep the
benchmark interest rate near zero for an “extended period.”  
 Commodity companies declined after crude oil for August
delivery in New York dropped as much as 1 percent today,
extending yesterday’s 1 percent decline. Copper futures for
September delivery lost as much as 1.6 percent, the first
decline this week.  
 Cautious Markets  
 “Sentiment remains very fragile,” said  David Moore , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in
Sydney. “Confidence has been rattled in recent months by
European fiscal issues and by data in the U.S. that’s been
uneven. They’re factors that have left markets cautious.”  
 BHP, which receives about 40 percent of its revenue from
petroleum and base metals such as copper, declined 1.3 percent
to A$39.13 in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest
mining company, dropped 1.7 percent to A$70.89.  
 Mitsubishi Corp., which gets about 40 percent of sales from
commodities, slid 0.9 percent to 2,003 yen in Tokyo.  PetroChina
Co. , the country’s largest oil producer, lost 1.4 percent to
HK$9.03 in Hong Kong.
