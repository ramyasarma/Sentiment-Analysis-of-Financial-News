             Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the
nation's biggest publicly traded retailer, said it may consider
separating its Big Bazaar hypermarket division.  
 ``We are looking at managing our big businesses
separately,''  Kishore Biyani , managing director of Pantaloon
Retail, told reporters in  New Delhi  today.  
 Big Bazaar has annualized revenue, of about 40 billion
rupees ($1 billion), Biyani said. That will rise to between 60
billion rupees and 70 billion rupees in the next year, he said.  
 Biyani, founder of Mumbai-based Pantaloon, is expanding the
Big Bazaar hypermarket chain as he seeks to capture the growth in
 India 's domestic consumption. Biyani expects the number of Big
Bazaar stores to double to 160 by the end of the year and 260 by
2011. Sales at store chains in India may rise eightfold to $97
billion by 2012, consultant Technopak Advisors Pvt. has forecast.  
 ``The domestic consumption market is about $350 billion now
and is growing between 8 percent and 10 percent,'' Biyani said.  
 Pantaloon in November 2006 set an annual sales target of 300
billion rupees by 2011 and a ninefold increase in retail space to
30 million square feet (2.8 million square meters). The retailer
posted a net income of 1.2 billion rupees, on sales of 32.4
billion rupees, in the year ended June 30.  
 Pantaloon, founded in 1987 as a garment maker, opened its
first retail outlet in the eastern city of Kolkata in 1997. The
retailer owns the Big Bazaar hypermarket, food and grocery,
clothing and bookstore chains, and home improvement stores among
other store formats. Biyani expects Pantaloon's home improvement
stores to have annual sales of 30 billion rupees next year.
