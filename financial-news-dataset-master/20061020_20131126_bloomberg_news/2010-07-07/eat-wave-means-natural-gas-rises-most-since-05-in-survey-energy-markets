             The hottest U.S. summer in three
years and the start of hurricane season means analysts are
forecasting the biggest gains in natural-gas futures since 2005
for the six months ending in September.  
 Gas may climb 27 percent from the first quarter to $4.90
per million British thermal units, according to the median of 13
analyst forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, extending a 19 percent
gain in the three months through June 30. The estimates ranged
from $4 to $5.50. August-delivery gas fell 11.7 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $4.565 per million Btu today on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  
 America’s fourth-hottest June on record and temperatures at
a record 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) have cut
inventory gains just as meteorologist forecasts for the  highest
number of named Atlantic storms  in five years raise concerns
about supply disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico. Supplies dropped
below year-earlier levels last month for the first time since
April, according to the Energy Department.  
 “You are going to get more gas burned in the cooling
season and the year-over-year storage deficit will persist,”
said  Martin King , an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in
Calgary who expects gas to average $5.20.  
 Temperatures were forecast to reach 100 degrees or feel
worse from Virginia to Maine, with Washington expected to hit
102 degrees today and 101 degrees tomorrow, and remain at 90 or
above until the weekend.  
 Gas has risen 33 percent from a year ago, compared with an
18 percent rise for crude oil, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Gas Rally  
 Prices almost doubled in the second and third quarters of
2005 after hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed 113 platforms
in the Gulf of Mexico and damaged 457 gas and oil pipelines,
according to U.S.  government data . Gas rallied 82 percent in the
six-month period and reached a record $15.78 that December.  
 Gas in the Gulf of Mexico represents about 10 percent of
U.S. production, down from 17 percent in 2005, Energy Department
data show. The reduced reliance, and the prospect of power
producers switching to cheaper coal, may cap gains, according to
 Teri Viswanath  a director of commodities research at Credit
Suisse Securities USA in Houston who forecasts $4.90 per million
Btu in the third quarter.  
 “The obvious cure to high natural-gas prices is high gas
prices,” said Viswanath. “Natural gas has now risen to a point
where coal-generation is recapturing market share.”  
 Exploration Gain  
 Prices may also be limited should producers expand
exploration and production, according to  Cameron Horwitz , an
analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. in Houston. There
were 960 active gas-drilling rigs in the week ended July 2, up
40 percent from a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes Inc.,
a Houston-based provider of services to the oil and gas
industry.  
 Horizontal rigs, which are mostly used in drilling for
shale gas, increased to a record 849.  
 “It will be difficult to break above $6 in the near term
given the supply picture,” said Horwitz . “If the gas rig count
rises above 1,000, it will overwhelm the system of supply.”  
 Prices rose 6.3 percent last month as a glut was eroded by
above-normal temperatures and a strengthening U.S. economy.
Industrial demand, which accounts for 28 percent of the nation’s
gas consumption, will increase 6.1 percent this year, the Energy
Department in Washington estimated on June 8.  
 Shrinking Surplus  
 The stockpile surplus compared with the five-year average
dropped to 12 percent in the week ended June 25 from 19 percent
at the end of April, according to the Energy Department.
 Supplies of 2.684 trillion cubic feet  were below year-earlier
levels for the second consecutive week.  
 “The year-over-year storage deficit will likely continue
to grow in the next few weeks, given the weather forecasts
calling for higher cumulative cooling degree days,” Viswanath
said.  
 There will be 861 cooling degree days in the quarter, the
highest level since 885 in 2007, according to  Travis Hartman , a
meteorologist at MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather,
based in Rockville, Maryland.  
 Power generators will use an average 26.55 billion cubic
feet of gas a day in the quarter, up 5.8 percent from the same
three months of 2009, the Energy Department said June 8. About
22 percent of electricity is generated by gas.  
 “If you have hot weather and active hurricanes together,
you will see gas prices continue to rise,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in Chicago, who expects
gas to average $4.90.  
 Hurricane Season  
 This hurricane season, which runs through November, may
produce as many as 23 named storms, the most since 2005,
according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  
 Hurricane Alex, the  earliest  Atlantic hurricane since 1995,
cut off about  919 million cubic feet  of daily production in the
Gulf of Mexico last month, about 15 percent of regional output,
before it came ashore in Mexico.  
 “Gulf gas production has dropped significantly and the
impact on gas prices is diminishing,” said  Peter Linder ,
president of the DeltaOne Energy Fund in Calgary, who said gas
will average $5.50 this quarter.
