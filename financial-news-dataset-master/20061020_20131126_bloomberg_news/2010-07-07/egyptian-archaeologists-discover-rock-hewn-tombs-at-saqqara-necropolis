             Two rock-hewn painted tombs have been
discovered in the ancient Egyptian necropolis of Saqqara, the
country’s Cultural Minister Farouk Hosni said today.  
 The tombs, one of which was intact and contained offering
jars and other grave goods, belonged to a senior official called
Shendwa and his son, Khonsu, according to the  Supreme Council of
Antiquities . Both men lived in the Sixth Dynasty, more than
4,200 years ago, the council said in an e-mailed statement,
citing Hosni and the country’s chief archaeologist, Zahi Hawass.  
 Located 20 miles south of Cairo, Saqqara is best known for
the step-pyramid of Djoser, the world’s oldest known monument
built using dressed stone.  
 Tourism, which accounts for 12.6 percent of jobs, is one of
Egypt’s main sources of foreign currency and brought in $10.76
billion in revenue last year, according to the tourism ministry.
