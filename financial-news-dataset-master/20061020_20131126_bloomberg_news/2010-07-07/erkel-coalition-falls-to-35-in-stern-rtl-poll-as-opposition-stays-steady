             Support for Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc fell 1 percentage point to 31
percent as coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, stayed
at 4 percent, according to a weekly voter poll by Stern magazine
and RTL television.  
 The combined 35 percent matches a record low of two weeks
ago, according to the poll. The opposition Social Democrats won
the backing of 27 percent of the respondents, the same as the
previous week, as the Green Party kept their 18 percent tally,
according the result.
