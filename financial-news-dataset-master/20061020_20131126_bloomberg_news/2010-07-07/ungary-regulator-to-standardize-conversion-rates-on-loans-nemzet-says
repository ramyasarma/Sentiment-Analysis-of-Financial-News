             Hungary’s financial regulator will
propose standardizing conversion rates on foreign-currency loans
to “significantly” cut costs to borrowers, the regulator’s
chairman,  Karoly Szasz , said according to Magyar Nemzet.  
 The regulator wants to set the conversion rate at the
official daily rate of the central bank or the average of rates
at which a commercial lender buys and sells a foreign currency,
 Magyar Nemzet  said. The measure would save borrowers as much as
7 percent on loans, Szasz said, according to the daily.
