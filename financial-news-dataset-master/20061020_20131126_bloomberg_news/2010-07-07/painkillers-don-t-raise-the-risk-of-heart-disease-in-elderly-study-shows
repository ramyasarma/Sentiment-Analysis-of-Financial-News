             Painkillers such as ibuprofen don’t
increase the risk of heart disease in elderly people and were
linked to a lower chance of an early death from any cause, an
 Australian study  found.  
 Using a  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , or NSAID, at
least once in two years didn’t significantly raise the risk of
having a heart attack, and was linked to a slight reduction in
the risk of heart failure, according to researchers led by
Arduino Mangoni, chair of medicine of old age at the  University
of Aberdeen  in Scotland. Prolonged use of any of the medicines,
including naproxen and diclofenac, slightly raised the heart
attack risk, the study of 320,000 Australians found.  
 The researchers couldn’t explain the findings on overall
deaths and suggested that the drugs may protect against heart
disease and cancer or allow patients to be more active. The
results, published in the  British Journal of Clinical
Pharmacology , contradicted 2008 findings by  Copenhagen
University  that patients have a higher risk of heart attack or
early death if they use NSAIDs.  
 “Our study primarily looked at elderly individuals,
whereas the Copenhagen study used people in their 40s and 50s,”
Mangoni, formerly of  Flinders University  in Adelaide, Australia,
said today in a telephone interview.  
 The Copenhagen research also included patients who had had
a heart attack or heart failure, so that study may have been
looking at "a much sicker population,’’ Mangoni said. “We
excluded anyone who had had heart failure or a heart attack in
the last two years.”  
 The research, based on a national database of 320,000
senior citizens’ hospital admissions and prescriptions, was
funded by the Australian Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
