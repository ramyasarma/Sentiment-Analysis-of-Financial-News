             A total of 21,734 Germans have
reported since February hitherto undeclared bank accounts in
Switzerland, Luxemburg and Liechtenstein,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing a survey of finance authorities in Germany’s 16 states.  
 Germany stands to gain at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.9
billion) in tax revenue from the voluntary disclosures, which
enable tax dodgers to avoid punishment.
