             New Gold Inc.  dropped the most in
seven months in Toronto trading after a Mexican court denied its
appeal against a September ruling to cancel a so-called
environmental impact study for the Cerro San Pedro mine.  
 New Gold said today in a PRNewswire statement it hasn’t
been provided with the court’s full decision and doesn’t know
the implications for the mine.  
 The shares fell 69 cents, or 11 percent, to close at
C$5.39, the largest one-day decline since Nov. 19.
