             Coffee crops in Brazil, the world’s
biggest producer and exporter of the bean, aren’t expected to
face frost in July, a weather forecaster said.  
 “There is just one polar mass coming to Brazil this month,
and it won’t make it to coffee producing areas,” Marco Antonio
dos Santos, an agrimeteorologist with Sao Paulo-based forecaster
 Somar Meteorologia , said today in a telephone interview.  
 Frost possibilities for August can’t be determined yet
because of the influence of the La Nina weather pattern, he
said. La Nina, caused by cooling temperatures in the Pacific
Ocean, may make polar masses “more intense,” he said.  
 Brazil may harvest 47 million coffee bags this year, up 19
percent from last year, the government’s crop forecasting
agency, known as Conab, said May 6. Coffee harvest in Brazil
runs from April to September.  
 A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).
