             Nomura Holdings Inc. , accused by
 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  and its creditors’ committee of
exaggerating its claims against the defunct firm, said the
committee unfairly sided with Lehman.  
 The committee that supported Lehman’s April 23 lawsuit
against Nomura “is charged to represent” creditors such as
Nomura and not Lehman, the Japanese financial firm said in a
court filing today.
