             Sugar prices jumped to an 11-week
high on speculation that demand will increase in Indonesia and
China, the world’s second-biggest consumer.  
 Wilmar International Ltd. , which this week agreed to buy
Australia’s biggest sugar refiner, said demand in Asian
countries exceeds annual supply by 30 percent. India, the top
user, probably won’t export any supplies soon to the global
market because domestic inventories are low, said  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an analyst at Barclays Capital in London.  
 “Pent-up demand and weather issues are providing some
support,”  Michael McDougal , a senior vice president at
brokerage Newedge USA in New York, said in a report.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.37 cent, or 2.2
percent, to 17.06 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. Earlier, the
price reached 17.15 cents, the highest level for a most-active
contract since April 20.  
 Sugar may climb as high as 19.65 cents, McDougal said. That
would mark the highest level since March 15.  
 Futures have slumped 37 percent this year on forecasts for
higher output in Brazil and India, the biggest producers.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, refined-sugar futures for
October delivery rose $9.60, or 1.9 percent, to $511.90 a metric
ton.
