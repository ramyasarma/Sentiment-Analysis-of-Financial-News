             Palm oil dropped close to the lowest
price in more than seven months as a stronger ringgit eroded the
appeal of the commodity amid rising vegetable oils supplies.  
 Futures for September delivery fell as much as 1.4 percent
to close at 2,270 ringgit ($705) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest price since Nov. 13.  
 The Malaysian ringgit has advanced 6.4 percent this year,
narrowing the price differential between palm and soybean oils
in dollars.  Palm olein  ended last week at $778.50 a ton, and
 degummed Argentina soybean  oil at $772.49, Bloomberg data shows.  
 The ringgit’s advance has coincided with record global
oilseed harvests this year on rising soybean production in South
America, which would pressure edible oil prices.  
 “The harvesting of the bumper South American soybean crop
is completed,”  Tan Chi Wei , an analyst with Maybank Investment
Bank Bhd., said in Kuala Lumpur. “The adverse impact on prices
would be felt in the coming months as the oil from these beans
enter the market post-crushing.”  
 Palm oil may average 2,250 ringgit in the second half of
the year, he said. The commodity averaged 2,519 ringgit in the
first half, according to Bloomberg data. Soybean and palm oils
account for more than 60 percent of the world’s edible oils.  
 Investors are looking for cues on production, exports and
stockpiles by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, said Arhnue Tan, a
senior analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn. The data is usually
released on the 10th of each month or the next working day.  
 Malaysia is the second-largest palm oil producer and
there’s concern the “stock levels are back on the uptrend since
exports look flat and production is recovering,” Tan said.  
 Malaysian Exports  
 June palm oil exports from Malaysia climbed 1.5 percent to
1.35 million tons, cargo surveyor Intertek said on June 30. The
gain was 1.2 percent to 1.34 million tons, according to rival
Societe Generale de Surveillance.  
 Shipments in May had climbed 6 percent to 1.36 million tons,
which helped reduce stockpiles by 3.7 percent to 1.56 million
tons, according to official data from the board.  
 CME Group Inc.’s September-delivery palm oil contract,
which is pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, lost 1.5
percent to $712 a ton yesterday.  
 On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil
was unchanged at 6,220 yuan ($914) a ton in Shanghai. Soybean
oil fell 0.1 percent to 7,332 yuan.
