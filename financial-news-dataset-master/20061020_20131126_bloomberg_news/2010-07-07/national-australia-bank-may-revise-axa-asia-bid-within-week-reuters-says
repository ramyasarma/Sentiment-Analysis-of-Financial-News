             National Australia Bank Ltd.  may
lodge a revised proposal to buy Axa Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd.
with Australia’s competition regulator within a week, Reuters
reported, citing three sources with knowledge of the deal.  
 The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission blocked
the A$13.3 billion ($11.3 billion) acquisition in April, citing
concerns that it would diminish competition in the market for
retail investment platforms. A rival bid by AMP Ltd.,
Australia’s second-largest asset manager, has been cleared by
the regulator.  
 National Australia Bank spokesman  George Wright  didn’t
immediately respond to phone messages seeking comment. The bank
said June 4 it’s in preliminary talks with potential buyers of
 Axa Asia Pacific ’s North investment platform in an attempt to
gain approval to purchase the investment manager.
