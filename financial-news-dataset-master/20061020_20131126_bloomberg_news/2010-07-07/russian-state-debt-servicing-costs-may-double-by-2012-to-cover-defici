             Russia may have to pay as much as $19
billion to service its debt in 2012, more than double this
year’s level, as the government borrows more to cover its budget
deficit, Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said.  
 “From next year the main source for covering the deficit
will be borrowing,” Kudrin told lawmakers in Moscow today. “If
we’re going to borrow, given the remaining deficit expenditures
for debt servicing will rise from 280 billion rubles ($9
billion) this year to 587 billion in 2012, even if we cut the
deficit to 2 percent in 2013.”  
 The government plans to fill this year’s budget gap,
estimated at 5.4 percent of gross domestic product, by drawing
1.4 trillion rubles from its Reserve Fund and borrowing 1.1
trillion rubles, Kudrin said. The fund stood at $39.3 billion at
the start of June, according to the Finance Ministry.  
 Russia’s budget deficit is set to shrink this year from 5.9
percent of GDP in 2009, as the world’s biggest energy exporter
recovers from a record 7.9 percent contraction last year. The
shortfall will shrink to 2.9 percent by 2013, Kudrin said. On
June 24, Deputy Finance Minister  Sergei Storchak  said that the
deficit would narrow to 3.6 percent next year, 2.4 percent in
2012 and 1.5 percent in 2013.  
 Russia plans to borrow 1.5 trillion rubles next year, 1.3
trillion rubles in 2012 and 931 billion rubles in 2013, Storchak
said, citing preliminary estimates. The share of foreign
borrowing won’t exceed 10 percent, he said.
