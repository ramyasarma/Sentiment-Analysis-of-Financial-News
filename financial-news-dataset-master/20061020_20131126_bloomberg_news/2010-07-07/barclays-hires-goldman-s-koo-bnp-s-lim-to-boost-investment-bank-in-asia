             Barclays Plc , the U.K.’s third-
biggest bank, hired  Vanessa Koo  from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and  James Lim  from BNP Paribas SA as part of plans to bolster
its investment-banking unit in Asia.  
 Koo will focus on mergers and acquisitions in China, Hong
Kong and Taiwan, while Lim will head real estate for Asia-
Pacific, the company said in an e-mailed press release today.
Both will be managing directors, the London-based bank said.  
 Barclays is luring executives from rival firms to compete
with  Goldman Sachs  and Morgan Stanley for work managing stock
sales and advising on takeovers in a region that’s home to the
world’s two fastest-growing economies.  
 Koo was most recently ran New York-based Goldman Sachs’s
China mergers advisory business. Lim was head of real estate for
Asia-Pacific at BNP Paribas’s investment banking unit before
resigning in March after 17 months with the company.  
 Recent Barclays hires include  Wu Sheng , a managing director
at  Citigroup Inc. ’s China investment banking team, people with
knowledge of the matter said last month. In March, the company
appointed former Goldman Sachs banker  Johan Leven  as co-head of
corporate finance for Asia-Pacific.
