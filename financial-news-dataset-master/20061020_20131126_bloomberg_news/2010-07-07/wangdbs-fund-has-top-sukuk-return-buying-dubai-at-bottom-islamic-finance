             HwangDBS Investment Management Bhd.
ran the best-performing sukuk fund in the past year as it bought
Persian Gulf debt after prices tumbled.  
 Malaysia’s  HwangDBS Aiiman Global Sukuk Fund  returned 28
percent, beating the 5 percent median return for 67 funds
tracked by Bloomberg that invest in Islamic bonds. Holdings of
the company include sukuk, or debt that complies with the
religion’s ban on interest, sold by an entity of Ras Al Khaimah,
one of the seven sheikhdoms that make up the United Arab
Emirates. It also held Shariah-compliant notes in Bahrain.  
 The fund snapped up debt as investors shunned Middle-
Eastern bonds after property prices slumped and forced Dubai
World to warn investors that it may default. HwangDBS bought
before the company, one of the U.A.E.’s three main business 
groups, agreed in May to restructure $23.5 billion in 
obligations, helping the  Dow Jones Citigroup Sukuk Index  extend
a rally from a low reached in December 2009.  
 “We came in at the right time when yields on those papers
were still quite high,”  Akmal Hassan , who helps manage 200
million ringgit ($62 million) of Shariah-compliant assets at
HwangDBS Investment in Kuala Lumpur, said in an interview
yesterday.
