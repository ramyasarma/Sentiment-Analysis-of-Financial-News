             China Gas Holdings Ltd. , the supplier
of the fuel to homes and business on the mainland, said profit
increased more than sevenfold on higher sales and gains in
derivatives contracts.  
 Net income rose to HK$875.6 million ($112.4 million), or
19.8 Hong Kong cents a share, in the year to the end of March,
from HK$103.7 million, or 3 Hong Kong cents a share, in the  same
period last year , the gas supplier said in a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange today.  
 The company that operates gas distribution projects in 117
cities in mainland China said last month it may post a
“significant” increase in net income, partly on gains in
interest rate swap contracts. First-half profit announced in
December jumped almost six-fold to HK$431.8 million after China
Gas started selling bottled liquefied petroleum gas.  
 The gas supplier aims to generate about 18 billion yuan in
revenue from LPG sales by 2012, Investor Relations Manager Frank
Li said on Dec. 3. Sales of the gas reached HK$2.2 billion in
the year to the end of March 2009, or about a third of total
revenue.  
 Shares  fell 1 percent this year, mirroring similar declines
by other Hong Kong-listed gas suppliers including  China
Resources Gas Group Ltd.  The benchmark Hang Seng index dropped 9
percent in the same period.  
 China, the world’s biggest polluter, wants to triple the
use of cleaner-burning gas to about 10 percent of the nation’s
energy consumption by 2020 to cut reliance on more polluting
coal.
