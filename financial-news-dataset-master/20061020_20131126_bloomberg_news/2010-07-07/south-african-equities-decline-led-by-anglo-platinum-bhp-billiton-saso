             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  declined 191.78, or 0.7 percent, to 26,532.09 by
10:31 a.m. in Johannesburg, paring yesterday’s 2.1 percent
increase.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 Anglo Platinum Ltd.  (AMS SJ), the largest producer of the
metal, lost 16.36 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 723.64 rand, its
biggest drop in almost a week.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. 
(IMP SJ), the world’s second-biggest platinum producer, slipped
3 rand, or 1.6 percent, to 183.50 rand. Platinum for immediate
delivery fell for the first time in three days in London, losing
as much as 1.6 percent to $1,492.85 an ounce.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, fell 1.79 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 202.79 rand, paring
yesterday’s 4.1 percent gain.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ)
retreated 2.81 rand, or 1 percent, to 269.50 rand. Copper
declined for the first time in four days, sliding as much as 1.3
percent to $6,518.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
after U.S. service industries expanded more slowly than
estimated, adding to concern the global recovery will weaken.  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, slumped 5.48 rand, or 2 percent, to 276.12 rand.
A close at this price would be the biggest drop since June 30.
Crude oil fell in New York for a seventh day, its longest losing
streak since December.
