             Alessandro Petacchi  won stage four of
the Tour de France by a bike’s length as  Fabian Cancellara  kept
the race-leading yellow jersey.  
 Petacchi of the Lampre team beat Garmin’s New Zealand rider
 Julian Dean  in a sprint after a flat 95-mile ride from Cambrai
to Reims. Seven-time champion  Lance Armstrong  and other race
contenders didn’t compete for leading places.  
 Cancellara of Team Saxo Bank remains in the lead by 23
seconds from Britain’s Geraint Thomas of Team Sky. Australia’s
two-time runner-up Cadel Evans of BMC Racing is third, 16
seconds further back.  
 Frenchmen  Nicolas Vogondy  and Dimitri Champion, among a
five-man breakaway after a mile, were caught by the main bunch
with two miles left. Petacchi came out on top after a sprint to
the line with about 200 meters remaining. The Italian also won
stage one.  
 Armstrong, who says he’s riding his last Tour, dropped to
18th from fifth overall yesterday after a puncture and is 2
minutes, 30 seconds off the lead.  
 Defending champion  Alberto Contador  is ninth overall, 1
minute, 40 seconds off the lead. He joked with teammates today
as they rode in the most relaxed stage so far.  
 Two days ago, dozens of riders crashed on rain-slicked
tarmac in Belgium and yesterday some were held up by punctures
on cobblestones in northern France.
