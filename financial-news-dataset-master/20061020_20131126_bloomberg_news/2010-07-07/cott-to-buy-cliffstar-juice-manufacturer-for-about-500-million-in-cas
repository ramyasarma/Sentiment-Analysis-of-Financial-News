             Cott Corp. , the largest North
American private-label soda maker, agreed to buy closely held
Cliffstar Corp., a maker of store brand juice for Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., for $500 million in cash.  
 Cott  will fund the transaction with up to $375 million in
new debt, as much as $95 million in new shares and up to $75
million in loans under its asset-based lending facility. The
deal is expected to close in the current quarter, Cott, based in
Mississauga, Ontario, and Tampa, Florida, said today in a
statement.  
 The addition of the country’s largest private-label juice
maker will give Cott more bargaining power with large customers
including  Wal-Mart . The acquisition may also provide more
manufacturing flexibility and savings, the company said.  
 “This transaction will transform Cott into a multicategory
beverage producer,” said Cott Chief Executive Officer  Jerry Fowden .  
 Cliffstar’s 1,200 employees make and distribute juices
ranging from apple to cranberry. The Dunkirk, New York-based
company, founded in 1970, has five plants, three fruit-
processing facilities, two fruit-receiving stations and one
storage facility. Annual sales reach $654 million, Cott said.  
 Cott rose 16 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $5.73 today in New
York Stock Exchange  composite trading . The shares have fallen 30
percent this year.
