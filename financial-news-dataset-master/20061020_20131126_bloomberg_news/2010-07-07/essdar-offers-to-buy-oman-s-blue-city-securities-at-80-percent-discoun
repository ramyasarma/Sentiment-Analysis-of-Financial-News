             Essdar Investments Ltd ., a fund
backed by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, offered to buy notes sold
by Oman’s stalled Blue City development at a discount.  
 Essdar will pay 20 percent of face value for class B1 and
class C securities in an offer that closes July 21, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. Holders will get a 1
percentage-point bonus if they sell the junior-ranked notes
before July 16.  
 There are $143 million of Class B1 notes outstanding and
$50 million of the Class C securities, according to the
statement. The bonds were issued in 2006 and mature in 2016.  
 Essdar Investments, the Cayman Islands-based partner of
Essdar Capital Managers Ltd. in Dubai, agreed last month to buy
99 percent of two other  Blue City  notes sold in 2006 after a
tender offer that closed on June 7. Those notes were bought at a
37 percent discount and had a combined face value of $661.5
million, it said at the time.  
 Blue City, an hour’s drive from the capital, Muscat, was
supposed to include more than 200 villas, 5,000 apartments, four
hotels, two golf courses and a clubhouse, according to the
prospectus for the bonds. A total of $925 million was raised
from bondholders to finance construction, which started in 2006.  
 The $20 billion project at the heart of Oman’s economic
transformation plans missed sales targets as real estate
speculators left Middle Eastern markets and a legal battle
between the project’s owners undermined investor confidence.
