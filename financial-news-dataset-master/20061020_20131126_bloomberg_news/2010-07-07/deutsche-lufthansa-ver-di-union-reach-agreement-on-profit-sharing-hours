             Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Europe’s
second-biggest airline, and the  Ver.di  union reached agreements
on a pay freeze and profit-sharing for 50,000 employees in an
initial accord on working conditions.  
 The wage freeze is in effect for 22 months through December
2011, the AGVL German airline-employers association representing
Lufthansa said today in a statement. Remaining points are likely
to be agreed on after further talks, and the parties have set a
deadline of July 28 for their completion,  Erhard Ott , Ver.di’s
chief negotiator, said in a separate statement.  
 Lufthansa  and Ver.di have held five rounds of talks this
year, including discussions in Frankfurt that concluded with the
agreement early today. Ver.di is representing ground-handling
employees, flight attendants and workers in the maintenance,
cargo and catering units at the Cologne, Germany-based carrier.  
 Employees will receive a 2 percent bonus for 2011,
depending on earnings goals being reached, the AGVL said. The
LSG Sky Chefs catering division has labor-cost reduction goals
to reach by the end of November 2010, it said.  
 The parties also agreed on terms for shortened work times
for employees approaching retirement and on limits to temporary
workers, Ver.di said.  
 The new contract extends a pay freeze that was effect since
March 1, the day after the last agreement expired, said  Claudia Lange , a spokeswoman for Lufthansa in Frankfurt.
