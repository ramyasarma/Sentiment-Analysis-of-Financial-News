             PSA Peugeot Citroen , Europe’s second-
largest carmaker, said sales rose 17 percent in the first half
as new models and French government incentives boosted
deliveries of its smaller vehicles.  
 The Peugeot and Citroen brands recorded combined sales of
1.86 million vehicles compared with 1.59 million a year earlier,
the Paris-based company said today in a  statement .  
 The gain reflects “a clear increase in our market share in
Europe,”  Jean-Marc Gales , the company’s sales chief, said in
the statement. Growth was helped by models introduced in 2009,
including the Peugeot 3008 and 5008 minivans and the Citroen C3
subcompact, he said.  
 Peugeot Citroen , which depends on western Europe for about
three-quarters of revenue, is pushing to expand overseas under
Chief Executive Officer  Philippe Varin . The company said sales
outside Europe accounted for 36 percent of deliveries in the
first half, compared with 34 percent a year earlier.  
 In  China , where Citroen introduced the C5 mid-sized sedan
in January, the group increased market share to 3.3 percent from
3.2 percent as deliveries jumped 49 percent, outpacing the
market’s 27 percent gain.  
 Registrations in Europe gained 7.7 percent to 1.21 million
vehicles, lifting Peugeot Citroen’s market share by 1 percentage
point to 14.6 percent as growth outpaced an industrywide
increase of 1.1 percent, the company said.  
 Peugeot and other makers of smaller cars have been helped
by sales incentives introduced last year by European governments
to encourage consumers to scrap older cars. France offered auto
buyers 700 euros ($880) during the first half, a figure that was
reduced to 500 euros starting in July. The  European market  will
contract by 9 percent this year as the incentives are withdrawn,
Peugeot reiterated today.
