             Pessimism and fear are creating
opportunities in the second half of 2010 for those with cash,
said  Terry Diamond , chairman of Talon Asset Management.  
 “I think we’re going to be in a stock picker’s market,”
said Diamond, 71, in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in
New York today. “We were probably too optimistic coming into
April and a little over pessimistic right now and that creates
opportunities for those that have dry powder.”  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has fallen about 6.6
percent this year on concern that widening budget deficits in
Europe might derail global growth.  
 Diamond said his investment-management firm, based in
Chicago, is looking at companies that make products that people
“need as opposed to what they want.” The firm recently bought
 CVS Caremark Corp. ,  Energizer Holdings Inc.  and  Cintas Corp. ,
and is looking at companies such as  Carnival Corp. , he said.  
 Talon has $1.2 billion in assets spread among  three hedge
funds , individually managed accounts, private equity and venture
capital. Diamond oversees Talon’s investment activities and
serves as a portfolio manager of Talon Opportunity Partners
L.P., a hedge fund.  
 Diamond co-founded the firm, which started managing assets
in 1984 and is owned by its employees. They require a minimum
investment of $1 million and charge clients a fee of 1 percent,
he said. The Chicago native worked at companies including  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  before Talon and has a law degree from
the University of Chicago Law School.
