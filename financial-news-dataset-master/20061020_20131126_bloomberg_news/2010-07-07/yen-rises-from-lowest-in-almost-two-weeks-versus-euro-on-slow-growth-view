             The dollar dropped against the New
Zealand dollar and Brazilian real as global stocks rallied on
the outlook for U.S. retail sales, reducing safety demand for
the world’s main reserve currency.  
 The euro rose to a six-week high against the dollar as
concern eased that the sovereign-debt crisis will get worse
after the European Union released details of its stress tests on
banks. The Canadian and Australian dollars advanced versus the
greenback as evidence the world’s largest economy is recovering
from the recession boosted commodities.  
 “The dollar is trading with risk sentiment,” said  John Doyle , a strategist in Washington at Tempus Consulting Inc., a
currency trading firm. “Stocks are gaining. Many believe it’s a
good buying opportunity.”  
 The dollar slid 1.4 percent to 70.34 U.S. cents versus the
New Zealand currency at 4:16 p.m. in New York, from 69.39
yesterday. The U.S. currency depreciated 0.8 percent to 1.7647
Brazilian reais, from 1.7796.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 3.1 percent after
falling 5 percent last week. Crude oil for August delivery
increased 3.4 percent to $74.42 a barrel after dropping
yesterday to its lowest since June 8. The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note increased 0.06 percentage point to 2.99 percent.  
 Australia’s dollar gained 1.4 percent to 86.48 U.S. cents,
from 85.27 cents yesterday. The Canadian currency appreciated
0.6 percent to C$1.0478 per U.S. dollar, from C$1.0545.  
 Dollar Flows  
 Investors have been pulling out of U.S. dollar positions,
according to Bank of New York Mellon Corp.’s iFlow data.
Cumulative outflows from the dollar totaled two times the
average amount compared with the previous year.  
 U.S. retailers’ sales probably expanded at an average
monthly rate of 4 percent in the first five months of the fiscal
year that began Jan. 31, the biggest gain since 2006, the
International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, said
before its June report tomorrow. Nordstrom Inc. and Kohl’s Corp.
are among chains that will report June sales increases at stores
open at least a year, according to analysts’ estimates.  
 The euro advanced 0.2 percent to $1.2649, from $1.2626
yesterday, and touched $1.2665, the highest since May 21. The
yen depreciated 0.2 percent to 87.70 per dollar, from 87.52,
after touching 86.97 on July 1, the strongest level since
Dec. 2. The euro gained 0.4 percent to 110.93 yen.  
 European Union regulators said they are carrying out stress
tests on 91 banks, accounting for 65 percent of the region’s
banking industry, to examine whether they can withstand a
shrinking economy and a drop in government bond values.  
 Stress Tests  
 The lenders being tested include 27 Spanish, 14 German and
6 Greek banks, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors
said in an e-mailed statement. EU banking regulators have told
lenders that their planned stress tests may assume a loss of
about 17 percent on Greek government debt and 3 percent on
Spanish bonds, according to two people briefed on the talks.  
 The shared currency has dropped 12 percent versus the
dollar this year on concern some nations in the euro zone may
not be able to finance their debt.  
 “It will take considerable time before the euro can regain
full confidence from investors,” said  Yuichi Onsen , chief
strategist in Tokyo at T&D Asset Management Co., which helps
oversee about $18 billion. “Sovereign problems in some euro-
zone countries haven’t shown clear sign of a full resolution.”  
 The euro’s recent rebound versus the dollar to above its
55-day moving average will probably fade as the currency
approaches resistance to further gains, according to Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  
 The euro dropped earlier after Germany’s Economy Ministry
said in Berlin that factory orders, adjusted for seasonal swings
and inflation, declined 0.5 percent in May. The median forecast
of 30 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.3
percent gain.  
 The shared currency is approaching the line defining its
trend lower at $1.2750 and will probably rise no higher than
$1.30,  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist in London at Bank of
Tokyo, said in a research report today.  
 The Swiss franc advanced 0.8 percent to 1.3299 per euro,
from 1.3373 yesterday. The currency has gained 3.5 percent
against its global peers this year, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indices.  
 Swiss National Bank policy makers led by President  Philipp Hildebrand  said on June 17 that deflation risk has “largely
disappeared,” ending the 15-month policy of countering what
they called “excessive” gains by the franc.
