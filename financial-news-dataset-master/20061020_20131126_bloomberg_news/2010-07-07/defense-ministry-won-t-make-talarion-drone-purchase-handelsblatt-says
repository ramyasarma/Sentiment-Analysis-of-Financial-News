             European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.’S so-called Talarion unmanned military drone will likely not
be purchased by Germany’s Defense Mininstry because of funding
constraints, Handelsblatt reported, citing a ministry draft of
proposed cuts.  
 The ministry should instead opt for the Saateg AA Male
drone that is an advanced version of the Heron model, the
newspaper said.
