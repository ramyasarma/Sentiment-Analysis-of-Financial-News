             Time Warner Inc.  plans to sell $3
billion of debt in a three-part offering as the owner of the
Warner Bros. movie studio and the HBO cable channel taps the
corporate bond market for the second time this year.  
 The offering will consist of $1 billion each of 5-, 10.5-
and 30-year obligations and may be sold as soon as today,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. New York-
based Time Warner said in a prospectus filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that proceeds will be used to
repay debt and for general corporate purposes. The prospectus
didn’t specify the size or timing of the issue.  
 The company “will find interest due to money managers that
have to put money to work and have until now not seen too many
big-sized new issues,” said  Rajeev Sharma , who oversees $1.4
billion of investment-grade holdings at First Investors
Management Co. in New York.  
 The 5-year debt may yield 140 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the 10.5-year notes may yield 175
basis points more than benchmarks and the 30-year debentures may
pay a 215 basis-point spread, according to a person familiar
with the offering who declined to be named because terms are not
public. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Previous Issue  
 Time Warner’s proposed sale follows a $2 billion issue in
March, as the company extends debt maturities while rewarding
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The
company raised its  quarterly payout  to 21.25 cents a share from
18.75 cents in February, and boosted its share buyback program
to $3 billion from $1 billion.  
 “The company continuously monitors the capital markets and
chooses to access the markets when it determines favorable
conditions exist,” said  Keith Cocozza , a spokesman for Time
Warner.  
 Time Warner  will use proceeds to redeem as much as $1
billion of 5.5 percent notes maturing in November 2011, $2
billion of 6.875 percent debt due in May 2012, and $1 billion of
9.125 percent notes dated January 2013, it said in the
prospectus.  
 “Maintaining a strong balance sheet, particularly in this
environment of an uncertain global economy, is a strategic asset
and is going to allow us to do everything that we choose to do
on a go-forward basis,” Chief Financial Officer  John Martin 
said in a May 27 presentation to investors.  
 Outstanding Debt  
 Time Warner had $11.2 billion of outstanding public debt
securities as of March 31, according to the prospectus.  
 The offering will be Time Warner’s biggest debt sale since
November 2006, when the company issued $5 billion of bonds in a
four-part offering.  
 Time Warner sold $1.4 billion of 4.875 percent, 10-year
notes in March that paid 130 basis points more than similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries and $600 million of 6.2 percent, 30-
year bonds at a spread of 162 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Proceeds from the March sale were used to redeem Time
Warner’s $1 billion of 6.75 percent debt maturing in April 2011,
it said in a filing with the SEC.  
 Time Warner’s offering is rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors
Service and the company has an equivalent BBB from Standard &
Poor’s.  
 Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the new sale, the person said.  
 The 30-year bonds sold in March fell 2.681 cents to 103.354
cents on the dollar to yield 5.957 percent, or 199.1 basis
points more than benchmarks, at 3:55 p.m. in New York, according
to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  
 The average BBB rated bond maturing in 10 years or more had
an absolute yield of 6.25 percent as of yesterday, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
