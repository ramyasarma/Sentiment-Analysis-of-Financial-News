             China’s finance ministry will sell at
least 28 billion yuan ($4.1 billion) of five-year bonds at 2.54
percent today, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  
 The highest forecast was 2.6 percent and the lowest 2.47
percent, the survey of 12 finance companies showed.  
 Similar-maturity notes yielded 2.57 percent yesterday,
according to  rates  compiled by Chinabond, the nation’s largest
debt-clearing house. The ministry last sold securities due in
five years on June 9 at 2.53 percent.  
 Investors will bid on the yield at the auction. The issuer
will set the security’s coupon by taking an average of the
winning bids. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
