             Vuvuzelas, the plastic horns heard
droning through every World Cup soccer match, will be banned
when South Africa’s world champion Springboks rugby team meets 
New Zealand’s All Blacks at Soccer City in Soweto next month.  
 The Aug. 21 match will be moved to the almost 90,000-seat
stadium after the Golden Lions Rugby Union, which has the right
to host international rugby in Johannesburg, agreed to move from
its home venue, the 62,000 seat Ellis Park. Soccer City hosts 
the FIFA World Cup final on July 11.  
 “We’d rather not have vuvuzelas” because they will drown
out calls by players at line-outs and scrums, Golden Lions
President Kevin de Klerk told reporters in Johannesburg today.
The match could draw the largest crowd for a home Springboks Test
match since 1955, when about 95,000 spectators watched the team
play the British and Irish Lions at Ellis Park.  
 Vuvuzelas have become one South Africa’s fastest-selling
sports items with manufacturers struggling to keep up. Four
weeks after the World Cup started the term, which is said to
mean “to make a loud noise” in Zulu, returns more than 20
million results when typed into  Google Inc’s  search engine while
Facebook Inc’s “I hate the vuvuzela sound”  group  has more than
1,609 followers. Some malls in South Africa have banned the
blowing of vuvuzelas after customer complaints.  
 South Africa spent about $4.6 billion building and
renovating 10 stadiums for the soccer World Cup, raising concern
that the country won’t be able to afford the cost of maintaining
the venues after the tournament ends. Maintaining the stadiums
is likely to cost between 350 million rand ($46 million) and 500
million rand a year, according to Udesh Pillay, co-author of
“Development and Dreams: The Urban Legacy of the 2010 FIFA
World Cup.”  
 Cut-Price Tickets  
 Ticket prices for the  Springboks-All Blacks  Test will be
reduced, the South African Rugby Union said in a statement.
More than 9,000 tickets will be sold at 350 rand each and a
further 5,000 for 100 rand each, exclusively in Soweto, the
lowest prices for a Springboks Test since 2005, it said.  
 The South Africa-New Zealand clash forms part of the
Tri-Nations, the southern hemisphere’s annual rugby 
championship. The Springboks are the current champions having 
beaten the All Blacks in all three games en route to the 2009 
title. The two teams have clashed 78 times in the past 89 years 
with New Zealand leading with 42 wins compared with South 
Africa’s 33 and a further three drawn.
