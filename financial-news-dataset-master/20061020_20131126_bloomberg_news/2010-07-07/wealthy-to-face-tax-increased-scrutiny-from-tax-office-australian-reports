             The Australian Taxation Office will
scrutinize the finances of more than 360 wealthy Australians
that hold at least A$30 million in assets, the Australian
newspaper reported.  
 People using tax secrecy havens will also face surveillance
under a new compliance program, the newspaper said. The nation’s
biggest tax probe, the Wickenby project, raised A$450 million in
liabilities in 2009-10 of which A$56 million was collected, the
report said.
