             The new Lexus LFA
stretches the Toyota line to the limit.  
 The latest Lexus model starts at $375,000. Toyota Motor
Corp., the same company that brings you the 51-mile-per-gallon
Prius and the $13,000 Yaris, will also be producing the Lexus
LFA, a 202-mile-per-hour, gasoline-evaporating supercar that
competes with the $320,000 Ferrari 599 GTB. Talk about a broad
family tree.  
 I consider this as I walk around one of three drivable LFA
prototypes in the world, which is sitting on a racetrack in
southern New Jersey. The other two are in Japan and Europe.
Until now, the $109,000 LS 600h L “executive sedan” hybrid was
the most expensive Lexus.  
 The LFA is no hybrid. It has beefy carbon-ceramic brakes,
swollen performance tires and a 552-horsepower V-10 engine that
will propel it to 60 mph (97 kilometers per hour) in less than
four seconds.  
 The LFA is a so-called halo car, designed to showcase the
company’s hottest designs and highest performance standards.
Only 500 LFAs will be built during a two-year run, with
production scheduled to start in December. About 175 will be
sold in the U.S.  
 Behind the wheel, steering is precise if a bit light, and on my
first lap around the track, I swing out too wide and rumble onto
the extreme edge of a curb. Yet the LFA is beautifully weighted,
a dancer on the balls of its feet, swiveling easily into tight
corners. By the eighth lap, I feel comfortable.  
 The new Lexus brings excitement to the Toyota line--if only for
a very few customers. Prius and Yaris, meet your new brother.
Family dinners are going to be more interesting.
