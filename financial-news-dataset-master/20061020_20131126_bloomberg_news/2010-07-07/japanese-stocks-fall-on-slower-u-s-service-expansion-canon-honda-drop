             Japanese  stocks  fell, ending three
days of gains, after U.S. service industries expanded more
slowly than expected, raising concerns a recovery in the world’s
largest economy is weakening.  
 Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that derives more than 80
percent of its revenue abroad, declined 1.6 percent.  Sony Corp. ,
which gets more than a fifth of its sales from the U.S., slid
1.7 percent. Sharp Corp., which receives more than half of its
sales overseas, dropped 1.5 percent.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. ,
Japan’s third-biggest shipping line by sales, slipped 3 percent
after bulk cargo rates fell.  
 “Economic data from the U.S. hasn’t been very positive,
and we’re still in a stream of uncertainties,” said  Naoteru Teraoka , general manager at the investment unit of Tokyo-based
Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees about $22
billion. “External factors are strongly influencing the market,
and it’s hard to foresee the future.”  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  slid 0.6 percent to 9,279.65 at
the close of trading in Tokyo, snapping a three-day winning
streak. The broader Topix index lost 0.7 percent to 841.51, with
more than four stocks dropping for each that rose.  
 The U.S.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  pared gains of as much
as 2 percent to close 0.5 percent higher in New York yesterday
after the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses in June fell more than expected to a
four-month low from May.
