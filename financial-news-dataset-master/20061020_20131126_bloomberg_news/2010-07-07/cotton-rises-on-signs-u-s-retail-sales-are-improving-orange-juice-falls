             Cotton futures rose for the first
time in three sessions as an increase in U.S. retail sales may
signal renewed demand for the fiber. Orange-juice futures fell.  
 Since the retail-industry’s fiscal year began on Jan. 31,
sales probably grew at the fastest pace in four years, the
International Council of Shopping Centers said in advance of its
June report tomorrow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped as
much as 2.5 percent after rising yesterday for the first time in
eight sessions.  
 “Cotton is trading on which way the Dow is going to go,
rather than cotton fundamentals,” said  Sid Love , the president
of Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting Services LLC in Overland
Park, Kansas. “Cotton is a crop that depends on demand in the
future.”  
 Cotton for December delivery rose 0.49 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 74.81 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, cotton slipped to 73.55 cents a pound, the lowest level
for a most-active contract since Feb. 12.  
 “It’s a two-sided market where everyone is trying to trade
on fundamentals, but the reality of this economy is that we are
only as good as the latest economic news,” said Love.  
 Also on the ICE market, orange-juice futures for September
delivery fell 1.1 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $1.445 a pound.
