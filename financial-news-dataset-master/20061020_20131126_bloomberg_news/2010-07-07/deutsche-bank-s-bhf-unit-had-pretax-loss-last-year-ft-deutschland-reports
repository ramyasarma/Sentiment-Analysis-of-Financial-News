             BHF-Bank AG, acquired by  Deutsche
Bank AG  when it took over Sal. Oppenheim Group, had a pretax
loss of 17 million euros ($21.4 million) in its “core
business” last year,  Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing
BHF’s annual report that was obtained by the newspaper.  
 Frankfurt-based BHF had costs of about 120 million euros
last year for severance payments, early retirements and hiring
as Deutsche Bank restructures the lender to prepare it for a
sale, the newspaper said.
