             China’s benchmark money-market rate
declined as demand for capital waned following a share offering
by Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  
 Investors’ subscriptions to yuan-denominated shares of the
nation’s largest lender by customers ended yesterday. The
Beijing-based bank is raising at least $19.2 billion in what may
become the world’s biggest initial public offering, according to
people with knowledge of the pricing for Hong Kong and Shanghai.  
 “There is no longer a huge demand for capital after
AgriBank’s online and offline subscriptions were completed,”
said  Tang Guohui , a bond analyst at Industrial Securities Co. in
Shanghai. “The rate will drop more after investors get their
money back later this week.”  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, declined 9 basis points to 2.6 percent as
of the 4:30 p.m. close in Shanghai, according to the National
Interbank Funding Center.  
 Investors who failed to subscribe to Agricultural Bank’s
equities will receive their funds back on July 8 and July 9,
according to the lender’s statement on July 1.  
 The central bank has  pumped  cash into the financial system
for six weeks to address a cash crunch that drove the seven-day
repurchase fixing  rate  to a year-high of 3.28 percent on June 2.  
 The yuan traded at 6.7772 per dollar, little changed from
6.7801 yesterday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency has strengthened 0.7 percent since the
central bank ended a two-year peg on June 19.  
 New Bonds Sale  
 Bonds rose after the government sold five-year bonds today
at a lower yield than analysts forecast on concern economic
growth may slow.  
 The finance ministry sold at least 28 billion yuan ($4.1
billion) of notes due in 2015 at a yield of 2.52 percent, two
basis points less than the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 12 finance companies. The auction drew bids 2.05 times
the offering amount, exceeding the average ratio of 1.7 at
previous government bond sales.  
 “Investors have worries about the economic outlook after
some indicators showed the growth may slow,” said  Chen Jianbo ,
a Beijing-based fixed-income analyst at BOC International (China)
Ltd., the investment banking arm of Bank of China Ltd. “Easier
money availability has also helped bolster demand.”  
 The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell for a second month,
dropping to 52.1 in June from 53.9 in May, the Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said July 1.  
 The yield on the 3.9 percent note due in August 2014 slid
one basis point to 2.46 percent, and the price of the security
added 0.04 per 100 yuan face amount to 105.58, according to the
national funding center.
