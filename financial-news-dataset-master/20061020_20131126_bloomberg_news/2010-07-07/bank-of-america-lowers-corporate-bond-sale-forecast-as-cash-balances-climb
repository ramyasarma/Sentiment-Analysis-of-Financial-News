             Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its
forecast for U.S. investment-grade debt sales in 2010 to $700
billion from $800 billion, citing growth in company cash
balances.  
 Corporate investment-grade bond issuance slowed to $387.8
billion in the first half of this year, the least since 2005,
amid concern among investors that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis
would spread, hampering the economic recovery. In response to
the recession, nonfinancial borrowers boosted cash and
equivalents from $814 billion in 2008 to $1 trillion in the
first quarter of this year, according to Bank of America data.  
 “Many issuers in high grade have flexibility to stay on
the sidelines because balance sheets have become increasingly
liquid over the past couple of years both for banks and
industrials,” Bank of America analysts  Hans Mikkelsen  and  Yuriy Shchuchinov  wrote yesterday in a report.  
 Financial companies can tap as much as $3 trillion of
“liquidity buffers,” including $1 trillion of excess reserves
and $1.4 trillion in holdings of U.S. Treasury and agency debt,
the analysts wrote.  
 This year’s investment-grade corporate debt sales compare
with $653.6 billion in the first half of 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance has fallen to the lowest since
reaching $382.4 billion during the six months ended June 30,
2005, the data show.  
 Bond Yields  
 Yields on investment-grade corporate debt fell 6 basis
points yesterday to 4.3 percent, the lowest since April 2004,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
Master Index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Companies are selling less debt to pay for mergers and
acquisitions and share buybacks amid higher financial market
volatility, the analysts wrote.  
 Global mergers and acquisitions have fallen 68 percent to
$425 billion in the second quarter of this year from $1.33
trillion in the same period in 2007, Bloomberg data show.  
 “With current very low costs of debt financing relative to
the cost of equity our outlook for 2010 was for elevated event
risk for bond holders, in the form of M&A activity and share
buybacks, with associated new issue supply,” Mikkelsen and
Shchuchinov wrote. “We have yet to see the increases in share
buyback and M&A volumes that are consistent with current pricing
of credit.”
