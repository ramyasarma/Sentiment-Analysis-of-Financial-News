             3i Group Plc , Europe’s largest
publicly traded private equity firm, said investments rose 38
percent in the second quarter, outpacing disposals as deal-flow
increased.  
 The firm invested 105 million pounds ($158.8 million)
compared with 76 million pounds in the year-earlier period,
London-based 3i said in a statement today. It raised 79 million
pounds by selling assets between April and June, compared with
163 million pounds a year earlier, it said. Realization proceeds
exclude the sale of Inspicio, a testing company, which won’t be
completed until the end of the summer, 3i said.  
 “We are seeing stable-to-improving earnings performance
across the portfolio and continue to see a good pipeline of
investment opportunities,” Chief Executive Officer  Michael Queen  said in the statement.  
 3i, one of U.K.’s oldest private equity firms, is seeking
to buy again after the credit crisis forced it to raise 700
million pounds and sell assets last year. Private equity firms
led $59 billion worth of transaction this year, or 76 percent
more than in the same period last year as banks resume lending
to fund takeovers.  
 Investments included 35 million pounds in French private
hospitals operator Vedici, 3i said. Net debt increased to 325
million pounds from 258 million pounds at the end of the year,
the firm also said.  
 3i had cash, cash deposits and uncommitted facilities of
2.36 billion pounds on June 30, compared with 2.73 billion
pounds at the end of the previous quarter, it said.
