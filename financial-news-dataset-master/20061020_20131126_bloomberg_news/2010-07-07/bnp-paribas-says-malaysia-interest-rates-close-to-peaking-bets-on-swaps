             BNP Paribas Investment Partners, a
unit of France’s largest lender, is using interest-rate swaps to
bet Malaysia’s interest rates will soon peak as concern about
inflation eases.  
 “We are bullish on Malaysia,” said  Adeline Ng , the
Singapore-based head of Asian fixed-income at the unit, which
oversees the equivalent of $682 billion globally. “We view Bank
Negara ahead of the curve and therefore inflation is within the
range of the official forecast.”  
 Bank Negara Malaysia will consider tomorrow whether to
raise interest rates for a third time this year as policy makers
across Asia weigh the risks of faster inflation against threats
to the global economic recovery. Of 20 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, 10 predict a quarter of a percentage point increase
in the benchmark overnight policy rate to 2.75 percent and the
remainder forecast no change. Central bank Governor Zeti Akhtar
Aziz said last week inflation is “not a concern.”  
 Among Asian countries, India will likely lift its benchmark
rates again, after last week announcing the third increase of
the year, while central banks elsewhere in the region may hold
off from tightening because of “the external uncertainty”
arising from Europe’s debt crisis,” Ng said in an interview
today.
