             Brazil’s  consumer prices  were
unchanged in June from the previous month as food prices fell
more than expected.  
 The result surprised all 40 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, whose median estimate was for an 0.11 percent
increase. Annual  inflation  as measured by the IPCA index slowed
to 4.84 percent in June, the lowest since February, the national
 statistics agency  said.  
 Last month’s food  price  deflation will likely give way to a
rise this month and next, pushing the IPCA’s year-on-year
reading back up further from the central bank’s 4.5 percent
 target , said  Diego Donadio , senior analysts for Latin America at
Banco BNP Paribas, who maintains his forecast for a year-end
annual inflation rate of 5.2 percent.  
 “The dynamic is not of continuous or intense deceleration
of inflation,” said Donadio in a telephone interview from Sao
Paulo. Central bankers are looking ahead to 2011 and are also
focused on reports showing Brazilian factories operating near
historic highs, he said.  
 The yield on the interest-rate future contract due in
October, the most traded on the Sao Paulo BM&F futures exchange
today, fell six basis points to 10.915 percent. The real rose
0.5 percent to 1.7711 per U.S. dollar at 10:23 a.m. New York
time.  
 Overheating  
 Economists and analysts had raised their  forecasts  for the
country’s  benchmark interest rate  this month as policy makers
try to stop the economy from overheating. Brazil’s  gross
domestic product  expanded 9 percent in the first quarter over
the same period a year earlier, its fastest pace in more than
two decades.  
 Manufacturers increased the use of installed capacity to
83 percent in April, the National Industrial Confederation
reported last month, a 19-month  high  and near the record
83.4 percent of December 2007.  
 The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or
minus two percentage points. Inflation has remained above the
mid-point of the government’s range every month this year.  
 In a July 2 central bank survey, analysts raised their
inflation forecast for the next 12 months to 4.86 percent, up
from a week-earlier forecast of 4.82 percent.  
 Four weeks ago economists in the survey were predicting
inflation of 4.72 percent. The survey showed that economists
expect a 2011 year-end inflation rate of 4.8 percent.  
 The monthly IPCA reading was the lowest since June 2006 as
food prices fell 0.9 percent from May, the biggest decline in
over a decade.  
 “For July, we expect a reversal of this decline of food
prices,” Donadio said.
