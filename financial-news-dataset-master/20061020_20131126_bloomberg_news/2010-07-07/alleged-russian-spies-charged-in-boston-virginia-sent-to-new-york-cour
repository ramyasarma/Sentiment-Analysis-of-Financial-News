             Five people accused of being Russian
spies were ordered transferred to New York by judges in
Massachusetts and Virginia amid reports the U.S. and Russia are
in talks over a prisoner swap.  
 U.S. Magistrate Judge  Jennifer C. Boal  in Boston issued the
order today after Donald Howard Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann
Foley asked to be transferred.  
 Michael Zottoli, Patricia Mills, and Mikhail Semenko were
ordered transferred today by Magistrate Judge  Thomas Jones  in
Alexandria, Virginia. They asked last week to keep their cases
in Virginia. The judge canceled a hearing on whether there is
sufficient legal cause to keep them detained.  
 The Associated Press and the Russian news agency  Ria
Novosti  reported today that the U.S. and Russia are working on
an exchange for the five involving an imprisoned nuclear
researcher. The AP cited the brother of the researcher as its
source.  
 The Russian prisoner is Igor Sutyagin, sentenced to 15
years in prison in 2004 for disclosing secrets to the U.S., Ria
Novosti said. Sutyagin, an arms control and nuclear weapons
specialists, may be traded for one of those being held in the
U.S., the news agency said, citing his lawyer.  
 Zottoli and Mills have admitted that they are Russians and
were using false names, U.S. prosecutors said in court last
week.  
 Arrests in U.S.  
 Zottoli, Mills and Semenko were arrested June 27 at their
Arlington, Virginia, residences, prosecutors said.  
 Defense attorneys in Boston last week said they would
challenge the government’s claims about their clients’
identities. While defense attorney  Peter Krupp  said his client
could be referred to as Donald Heathfield, a lawyer for the
woman the government calls Tracey Lee Ann Foley asked that she
be known as “Defendant No. 5.”  
 The Virginia cases are USA v. Mills, 10-405, and USA v.
Semenko, 10-408, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Virginia (Alexandria). The Boston case is U.S. v. Defendant No.
4, 10-mj-256, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston).
