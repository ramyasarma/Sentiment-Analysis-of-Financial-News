             Israeli government bonds gained for
the first time in four days as investors shifted to safer assets
and equity markets fell amid signs the global economy recovery
is faltering.  
 “There’s investor stress right now and overall concern
with growth in the U.S. and Europe,” said  Jonathan Haddad , an
analyst at Meitav Mutual Fund Management. “A drop in stocks
globally and falling yields in the U.S. are driving bond yields
here lower as well.”  
 Treasury two-year note yields were within three basis
points of the all-time low and 10-year yields were at almost
their lowest level this year. A report yesterday showed
expansion in U.S. service industries, the largest part of the
economy, slowed in June. Israel’s TA-25 index lost 1.4 percent
to 1,074.23.  
 The 10-year Mimshal Shiklit maturing in January 2020
increased 0.17 shekel to 105.37 at the close in Tel Aviv,
pushing the yield on the 5 percent notes down two basis points
to 4.58 percent.  
 The spread between 10-year Treasuries and Israeli
government bonds due in 2020 tightened by three basis points to
164 basis points after touching a year high of 167 yesterday.  
 The  shekel  strengthened almost 0.1 percent 3.8900 per
dollar at 4:35 p.m. in Tel Aviv.
