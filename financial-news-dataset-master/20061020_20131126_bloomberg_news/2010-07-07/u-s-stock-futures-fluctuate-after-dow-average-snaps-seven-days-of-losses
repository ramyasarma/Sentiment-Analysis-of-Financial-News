             U.S. stock-index futures fluctuated a
day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a seven-day
losing streak, its longest slump since the financial crisis of
2008.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were unchanged
at 1,024.2 at 8:44 a.m. in New York after slumping as much as
0.8 percent earlier. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
slipped 3 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 9,679.
