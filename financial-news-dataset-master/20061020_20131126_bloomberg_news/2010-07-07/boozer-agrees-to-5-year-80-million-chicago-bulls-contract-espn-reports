             Free-agent forward  Carlos Boozer 
has agreed to a five-year contract with the Chicago Bulls,
ESPN reported on its website.  
 The agreement is worth $80 million, the  network said ,
citing an unidentified person close to the negotiations.
National Basketball Association teams may not sign players
or discuss possible contracts publicly until tomorrow.  
 Boozer, 28, averaged 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per
game last season for the Utah Jazz. The eight-year NBA
veteran, a two-time All-Star, has career averages of 17.2
points and 10.2 rebounds.  
 The Bulls are among the NBA teams seeking to sign two-
time league Most Valuable Player  LeBron James , who will
announce his decision tomorrow on a live 9 p.m. New York
time broadcast on  Walt Disney Co .’s ESPN.  
 The Bulls’ signing of Boozer, which adds him to a
roster that also includes point guard  Derrick Rose  and
forward  Joakim Noah , does not preclude them from also
adding James, though they’d have to do some “creative
financing” to fit him under the salary cap, ESPN said.
