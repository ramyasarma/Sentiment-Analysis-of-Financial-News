             Chris Bosh  will join  Dwyane Wade  on
the Miami Heat; it’s not clear whether  LeBron James  will play
there, too,  according to ESPN .  
 Bosh, 26, who averaged 20.2 points a game and 9.4 rebounds
during his seven-year career with the Toronto Raptors, and Wade,
also a free agent, will announce their decisions today, ESPN
reported, citing a person with knowledge of the situation the
cable sports network didn’t identify.  
 Wade, 28, averaged 25.4 points and 6.6 assists during his
seven-year career with Miami. The Heat won the National
Basketball Association championship in 2006, and Wade was the
Most Valuable Player of the Finals.  
 Bosh and Wade are expected to get the maximum contracts
allowed under the NBA’s labor contract, although adding James,
the NBA’s reigning two-time MVP, could change the players’
salaries, ESPN said.  
 James, who averaged 27.8 points, 7.0 rebounds and 7.0
assists during his seven-year career with the Cleveland
Cavaliers, is scheduled to announce which team he will play for
on a televised show tomorrow night, ESPN has said.
