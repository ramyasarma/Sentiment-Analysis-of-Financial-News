             German prosecutors searched offices
of  Arques Industries AG  as part of a criminal investigation
spurred by Siemens AG, the company’s partner in the Gigaset
cordless-phone company.  
 Today’s searches in Munich, ordered by the prosecutor’s
office in the city, are part of a preliminary investigation
against Arques executive board member  Michael Huetten  on
suspicion he committed breach of trust, Arques said in an e-
mailed statement.  
 The case involves the allegation that Huetten canceled a
request for a payment of 19.6 million euros ($24.8 million) by
Arques when he was managing director of Gigaset Communications
GmbH in 2009, according to the statement.  
 The allegations are “not supportable,” Arques said.  
 Arques is Gigaset’s majority owner. Siemens, Europe’s
largest engineering company, holds a 19.8 percent stake. Today’s
action by prosecutors was triggered by a criminal complaint
filed by Munich-based Siemens claiming breach of trust by
Huetten and other Arques officials, Siemens spokesman  Marc Langendorf  said in a telephone interview.  
 Authorities searched two offices and a private residence
today, said  Barbara Stockinger , a spokeswoman for the Munich
prosecutor’s office. She declined to discuss details of the
case.  
 Arques, based in Starnberg, Germany, posted a profit of
1.03 million euros in the first quarter, compared with a 38.5
million-euro loss a year earlier, the company said June 30.
