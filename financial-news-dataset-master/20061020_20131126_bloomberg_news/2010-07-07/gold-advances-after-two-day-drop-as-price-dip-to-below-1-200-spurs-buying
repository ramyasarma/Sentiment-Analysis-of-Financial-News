             Gold declined to a six-week low in
New York as some investors sold the metal after its rally to a
record last month and as a stronger dollar sapped bullion’s
appeal as an alternative asset.  
 The dollar gained against the euro after International
Industrial Bank, the Russian lender controlled by lawmaker
 Sergei Pugachyov , said it defaulted on 200 million euros ($252
million) of bonds that matured yesterday. Gold, which typically
moves inversely to the greenback, has dropped 6.3 percent from a
record set on June 21.  
 Gold “is looking increasingly bearish and we could see
even more technical selling and profit-taking,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London. Still, “the
downside will remain very limited as long as economic
uncertainty prevails.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August lost as much as $9.70,
or 0.8 percent, to $1,185.40 an ounce, the lowest price since
May 24. The metal traded at $1,186.90 at 8:02 a.m. on the Comex
in New York. Gold for immediate delivery in London was 0.5
percent lower at $1,186.70.  
 The metal fell to $1,186 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,195 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. The dollar gained as
much as 0.6 percent against the euro today.  
 “The dollar is exerting an influence on gold at the
moment,” said Park Jong Beom, a Seoul-based senior trader with
Tong Yang Futures Co. “Gold has been losing some momentum since
breaking higher to a record last month as more investors are
enticed to book profits.”  
 Chinese Buying  
 Bullion futures have climbed 8.3 percent this year,
reaching a record $1,266.50 last month, as investors sought to
protect their wealth from prolonged financial turbulence in
Europe and on concern the global recovery may slow. The
International Industrial Bank said yesterday that it is
considering a “limited extension” of maturity on the notes and
plans to meet with bondholders in London on July 21.  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, fell 2.43 metric tons to 1,316.48 tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. Global holdings
of the metal by ETFs added 1.9 tons to a record 2,069.5 tons
yesterday, according to  Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 Gold demand in China gained in the first half as government
measures to cool the property market and falling equities
spurred buying, Song Yuqin, vice general manager at the Shanghai
Gold Exchange, said today at a conference in Beijing.  
 Gold is unlikely to become a major holding in China’s
foreign reserves owing to the metal’s big price swings and lack
of interest payments, China’s State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said in a statement on its website. China will
“carefully consider” whether to raise or reduce the amount of
gold it has, the regulator said.  
 Silver for September delivery in New York lost 1.3 percent
to $17.63 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery fell 0.5
percent to $1,511.20 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery
declined 1.1 percent to $435.60 an ounce.
