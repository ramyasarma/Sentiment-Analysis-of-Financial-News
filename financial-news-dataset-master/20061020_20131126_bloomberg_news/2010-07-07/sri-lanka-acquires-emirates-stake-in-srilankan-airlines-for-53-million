             Sri Lanka bought Emirates Airline’s
stake in SriLankan Airlines for $53 million, about a third of
the price that Dubai-based Emirates valued the stake at two
years ago.  
 The government acquired the 44 percent stake through Bank
of Ceylon, the island’s biggest state-owned lender, Treasury
Secretary P.B. Jayasundera said in the capital Colombo today,
without elaboration. The government previously held 51 percent
of the  flag carrier , with the rest owned by staff.  
 The deal may help Sri Lanka boost tourism following the end
of a 26-year civil war and position the island to benefit from
rising travel in India, the world’s second-most populous country.
Emirates ended a 10-year management agreement with SriLankan in
2008 when it valued its stake at $150 million.  
 Emirates initially bought 40 percent of the then Air Lanka
in 1998 for $70 million. The carrier didn’t renew the management
accord because the government wanted greater day-to-day control
over operations, Emirates President Tim Clark said at the time.  
 Emirates will issue a statement shortly, said a spokeswoman,
who declined to be identified citing company policy.
