             Australia’s competition regulator may
not make a decision on National Australia Bank Ltd.’s possible
renewed bid for Axa Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd. until September,
the Australian newspaper reported, without saying where it got
the information.  
 The bank is negotiating the sale of Axa’s North platform to
win approval from the Australian Competition & Consumer
Commission after an earlier deal was blocked, the newspaper
said. National Australia Bank and Axa have the right to
terminate their agreement from July 15, the newspaper said.
