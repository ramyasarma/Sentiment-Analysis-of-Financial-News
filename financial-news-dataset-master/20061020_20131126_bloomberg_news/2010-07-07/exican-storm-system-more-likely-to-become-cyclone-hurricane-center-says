             Thunderstorms moving west-northwest
in the Gulf of Mexico have a 50 percent chance of forming into a
tropical system in the next day or so, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said.  
 The system is heading toward landfall over Mexico or
southern Texas, the  hurricane center  said on its website at 2
p.m. Miami time. The potential of formation is up from 30
percent yesterday.  
 “At its very worst, it will develop into a tropical
depression or a very weak tropical storm before it makes
landfall,” said  Jim Rouiller , a senior energy meteorologist at
 Planalytics Inc.  in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. “The thing is, it is
starting to run out of time.”  
 When such weather systems become more organized, they form
tropical depressions that can strengthen into tropical storms
and hurricanes.  
 Rouiller said the system, which is following a track
similar to the one hurricane Alex took last week, won’t be a
threat to U.S. oil and gas rigs in the Gulf. The storm, which
may come ashore near Brownsville, Texas, is likely to bring
heavy rains across southern Texas and northern Mexico.  
 The weather system is southwest of the site where  BP Plc  is
trying to stem and clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 31 percent of U.S. oil
output, 10 percent of its gas production and has seven of the 10
busiest ports.
