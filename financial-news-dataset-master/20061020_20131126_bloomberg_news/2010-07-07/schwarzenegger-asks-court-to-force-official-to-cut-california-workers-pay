             California  Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s administration today asked a judge to force
state Controller  John Chiang  to slash the pay of almost 200,000
state workers to the minimum wage until a budget is passed.  
 Schwarzenegger’s personnel director, Debbie Endsley, today
sued Chiang in Sacramento County Superior Court, seeking an
injunction that would force him to begin the programming of
payroll computers to reduce the pay before July 22.  
 The Republican governor issued the pay cut order July 1,
after lawmakers failed to send him a budget before the fiscal
year began that day. Chiang refused to follow the order, saying
he would wait until he’s exhausted an appeal of another court’s
ruling that he must follow a similar pay cut order from 2008.  
 “Since the Controller continues to ignore court decisions
we must again ask the court to stop him from violating the
law,” Schwarzenegger spokesman  Aaron McLear  said in a statement
today. “The courts have been clear: in the absence of a state
budget or other available appropriation, the Controller does not
have the authority to continue paying regular salaries and
wages.”  
 Schwarzenegger and the Democrat-controlled Legislature are
at odds over how to bridge a $19.1 billion deficit. In 2003, the
state’s high court ruled that California can withhold salaries
during budget impasses as long as it complies with federal law,
which requires paying at least minimum wage, currently $7.25 an
hour.  
 Chiang also has said the state’s payroll computers aren’t
equipped to make the salary reductions.
