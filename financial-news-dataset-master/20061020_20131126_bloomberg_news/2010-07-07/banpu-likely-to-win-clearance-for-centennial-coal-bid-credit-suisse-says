             Banpu Pcl, Thailand’s biggest coal
producer, is likely to win approval for its A$2 billion ($1.7
billion) bid for the rest of  Centennial Coal Ltd.  from
Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, Credit Suisse Group
AG said.  
 “This deal had a high probability of receiving FIRB
approval,”  Paul McTaggart , a Credit Suisse analyst, said in a
report today after consulting with an unidentified industry
expert. “He could see nothing that could seriously be said to
be contrary to the national interest.”  
 Buying Centennial would give Bangkok-based  Banpu  control of
10 mines in Australia and power station customers in Japan and
Europe. There is a 50 percent chance the regulator will extend
an initial 30-day review period, McTaggart said.  
 Banpu agreed to pay A$6.20 in cash a share for the 80
percent of Centennial it doesn’t already own, the two companies
said this week.
