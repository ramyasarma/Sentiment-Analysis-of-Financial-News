             Emirates NBD PJSC, the United Arab
Emirates’ largest bank by assets, and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank
PJSC were rated new “buy” as Rasmala Investments initiated
coverage on six banks.  
 “The market is pricing in three main categories of risks:
existing balance sheet risk, the rescheduling/restructuring
risks related to ‘Dubai Inc’ and the broader structural risks
that are somewhat harder to quantify,”  Raj Madha , a Dubai-based
bank analyst wrote.?“We think returns for the sector are set to
recover strongly once provisioning settles down.”  
 Rasmala also initiated National Bank of Abu Dhabi with
“buy”, and First Gulf Bank PJSC, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and
Dubai Islamic Bank with “hold”.
