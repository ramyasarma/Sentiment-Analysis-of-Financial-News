             Showa Denko K.K. rose the most in
three weeks in Tokyo trading after Nikkei English News reported
the Japanese chemical maker’s six-month operating profit may
have exceeded a previous forecast by 1 billion yen ($11
million).  
 Showa Denko climbed 3.1 percent to 166 yen as of 9:05 a.m.
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, headed for the biggest advance
since June 16. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped
0.5 percent.
