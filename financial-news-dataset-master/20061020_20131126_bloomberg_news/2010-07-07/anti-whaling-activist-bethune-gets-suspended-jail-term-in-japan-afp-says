             Anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune
received a suspended jail term in Japan today, Agence France-
Presse reported, citing Jiji.  
 Bethune, a New Zealander, pleaded guilty in May to four
charges including trespassing, vandalism and possessing a knife.
He denied an assault charge.  
 Bethune boarded Japan’s Shonan Maru 2 in the Antarctic
Ocean in February in what activist group Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society said was an attempt to make a citizen’s
arrest of the Japanese captain.
