             Wells Fargo & Co. said it’s cutting
3,800 jobs as part of the restructuring of its Wells Fargo
Financial division.  
 About 2,800 jobs will be cut in the next 60 days and 1,000
likely to be eliminated over the next 12 months. Wells Fargo
Financial employs about 14,000.  
 The unit is closing 638 Wells Fargo Financial stores in the
U.S. and exiting the origination of non-prime portfolio mortgage
loans.
