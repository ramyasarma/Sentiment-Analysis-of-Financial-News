             As some Wall Street executives cut
their charitable donations last year, the foundation of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Lloyd Blankfein  boosted
its giving by 25 percent, according to the nonprofit’s federal
tax filings.  
 The Lloyd & Laura Blankfein Foundation’s more than 30
donations totaled almost $1.7 million in its fiscal 2010, which
ended Jan. 31, compared with $1.3 million the previous year. The
gifts ranged from $620,000 to  Harvard Law School  to a $250 check
to the  Bridgehampton Fire Department  on Long Island.  
 The Harvard Law gift and a $500,000 donation to the  Ethical
Culture Fieldston School  were the largest (there were two other
Fieldston donations totaling $45,000). Blankfein’s sons, Alex
and Jonathan, and his wife, Laura Jacobs Blankfein, attended
Fieldston. The charity also gave $50,000 to Barnard College,
Laura Blankfein’s alma mater.  
 Harvard Law spokeswoman Emily Dupraz said the institution
doesn’t comment on “or disclose information” about alumni
gifts.  
 “Gestures like the gift to the fire department are ‘good-
neighbor grants,’” Melissa Berman, chief executive officer of
Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors in New York, said in a phone
interview. “The gifts to schools one has attended are
affiliation grants. All of us, even people of modest resources,
support their local house of worship or institutions they have
been affiliated with.”  
 The foundation gave $100,000 to the  UJA-Federation of New
York  and the  Weill Cornell Medical College . Its donations last
year to the  Robin Hood Foundation  rose to $46,500 from $5,000 in
2008. In 2006, Blankfein made two donations to Robin Hood
totaling $850,000.  
 Decade’s Legacy  
 In the past decade, the Blankfeins have been quietly
creating a philanthropic legacy through their foundation, giving
an average of $1.3 million a year. During that period,
Blankfein’s pay included an annual salary of $600,000 and $125.6
million in cash bonuses. He took home a total of $240 million in
salary, bonuses and stock awards from 2000 to 2009, according to
Goldman filings.  
 Goldman spokesman Joseph Snodgrass declined to comment
about Blankfein’s philanthropy.  
 The couple also made grants to the arts, giving $5,000 each
to the  Brooklyn Academy of Music  and the  Roundabout Theatre Co .
in Manhattan, New York’s largest nonprofit theater, which has
staged several Tony award-winning plays. Carnegie Hall received
$10,000.  
 Smaller gifts of $1,000 each went to  Dorot , a New York
nonprofit that aids the elderly, the  Animal Rescue Fund of the
Hamptons  and New York Cares, which mobilizes volunteers to help
the city’s disadvantaged.  
 Other Gifts  
 Berman said it’s possible that Blankfein also gives some of
his wealth regularly to “Goldman Sachs Gives,” a donor-advised
fund set up in November 2007 by the company. Upon its launch,
Goldman’s partners agreed to commit “a part” of their overall
compensation to charitable organizations around the world.  
 “It’s impossible to tell from the family foundation
information the scope of what Lloyd Blankfein and his family
care about because I think we’re only seeing a tiny fraction of
what they’re giving,” Berman said.
