             Brazil’s Bovespa stock index gained
for a second day, extending the steepest rise in four weeks, as
traders pared bets for higher interest rates after Brazil’s
consumer prices were unchanged in June from the previous month.  
 Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes,
Brazil’s biggest homebuilder by market value, climbed 1.7
percent following the lowest monthly consumer prices reading
since they fell in June 2006. Redecard SA, Brazil’s second-
largest card-payment processor by market value, jumped 1.8
percent.  
 The Bovespa stock index added 0.3 percent to 62,221.80 at
9:45 a.m. New York time. Forty-seven companies gained on the
index while 18 fell. The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.7738
per dollar.
