             U.K. gilt futures may advance as high
as 123.61 should they pass a key level, UBS AG said, citing
technical indicators.  
 The contact expiring in September would accelerate towards
the “psychological round number resistance” 122 mark if it
breaks above the 121.51 high reached on July 1, according to
 Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy at UBS
in London.  
 “Gilts are bullish while they trade above the 120.36
retracement,” Adcock wrote in a research note today. “A break
above Thursday’s 121.51 high will be the next bullish
development.” The 123.61 target is the 162 percent Fibonacci
extension of the “March 2009-June 2009 bear trade,” the note
said.  
 The September gilt contact rose 0.16 percent to 121.28 as
of 11 a.m. in London.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory
that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a
high or low.
