             Chaowei Power Holdings Ltd. , the
electric-bike battery maker, fell in its Hong Kong trading debut
as investors shunned new share offerings in the city.  
 The stock dropped as much as 8.7 percent from the opening
price of HK$2.16. Chaowei was down 5.5 percent at 10:40 a.m.
local time, compared with the 1 percent decline in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index.  
 “The market is really lacking confidence and there just
aren’t enough buyers for this kind of share offer at the
moment,” said  Francis Lun , general manager at Fulbright
Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.  
 The Hang Seng declined 9 percent this year as worries about
budget deficits in Europe and tighter monetary policy in China
dented confidence in the strength of the global economy. Sound
Global Ltd., a Singapore-based wastewater treatment provider in
China, last month postponed a dual listing in Hong Kong and the
sale of new shares.  
 China Liansu Group Holdings Ltd., a producer of plumbing
supplies, lost as much as 3.5 percent on its debut in Hong Kong
on June 23.
