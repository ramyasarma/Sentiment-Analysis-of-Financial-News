             Russian consumer confidence in the
second quarter rose the most in almost two years as Russians
became more optimistic about their personal finances.  
 Confidence advanced 3 percentage points to minus 7 percent,
the highest since the third quarter of 2008, the Moscow-based
 Federal Statistics Service  said in an e-mailed statement today.
The gauge rose 10 percentage points in the first quarter.  
 An increasing number of people expected their personal
finances to improve in the next 12 months and said the
conditions were favorable for both savings and purchases,
according to the statement.  
 Russia’s economy expanded an annual 2.4 percent last month,
the fastest pace since November 2008, VTB Capital said on July
6. The inflation rate fell to 5.8 percent in June from 6 percent
a month earlier, according to the statistics office. Consumer-
price growth was 0.4 percent in the month, compared with 0.5
percent in June.  
 Bank Rossii last month left its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at a record-low 7.75 percent, ending a 14-month easing
cycle as economic recovery gathers speed. Gross domestic product
may rise 7 percent this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Global Economist  Jim O’Neill  said on June 19, compared with the
government’s 4 percent forecast.
