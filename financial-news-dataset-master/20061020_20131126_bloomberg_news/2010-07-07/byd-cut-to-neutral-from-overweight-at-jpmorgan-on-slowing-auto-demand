             BYD Co. was cut to “neutral” from
“overweight” by JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Charles
Guo, who said the “drastic slowdown” in auto demand will drag
on sentiment in the near term while positive newsflow on new
energy is likely to decrease.  
 The analysts reduced their share-price estimate for BYD to
HK$52 from HK$83.
