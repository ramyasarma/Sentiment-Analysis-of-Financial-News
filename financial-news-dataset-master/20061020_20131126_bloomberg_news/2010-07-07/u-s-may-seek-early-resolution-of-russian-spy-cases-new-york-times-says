             The U.S. government is in talks with 
lawyers for suspected Russian undercover agents over a quick 
resolution of the case that may allow them to plead guilty to 
lesser charges and return to Russia, the New York Times 
reported, citing unidentified persons briefed on the case.  
 The proposed solution would help the government avoid a 
long trial that might expose sensitive intelligence information
as well as extensive media publicity and possible damage to 
U.S.-Russia relations, the newspaper added.  
 Defense lawyers and the federal prosecutor’s office in 
Manhattan declined to comment on whether such talks are being 
held, the newspaper said.
