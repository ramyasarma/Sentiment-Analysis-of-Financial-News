             China’s gold output this year may
gain 5 percent from about 313 metric tons last year, Song
Quanli, deputy party sectretary general at China National Gold
Group Corp., China largest gold producer, said in an interview
today.  
 “But the output growth can not keep up with the demand
growth so far this year given investors’ enthusiasm for physical
gold holdings such as gold bars,” Song said. “Our
retail branches reported 30 percent to 40 percent growth in
sales in the first half of this year.”  
 Separately, the company is considering listing its non-gold
related assets in Hong Kong, Song said.
