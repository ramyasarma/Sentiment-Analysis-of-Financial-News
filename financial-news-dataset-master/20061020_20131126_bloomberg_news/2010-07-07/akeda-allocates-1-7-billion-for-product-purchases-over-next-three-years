             Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. will set
aside 50 billion yen ($569 million) annually for the next three
years to buy new products, said Mitsuo Oguri, a company
spokesman in Tokyo.  
 The funds are in addition to what the Osaka, Japan-based
company usually sets aside for buying new drugs, Oguri said in a
telephone interview today. The news was reported earlier by the
Yomiuri newspaper.
