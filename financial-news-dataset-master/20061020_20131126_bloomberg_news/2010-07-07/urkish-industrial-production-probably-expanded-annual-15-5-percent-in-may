             Turkish  industrial output  probably
increased for a sixth month in May as the economy picked up from
last year’s recession, a survey showed.  
 Output rose 15.5 percent from a year earlier, down from 17
percent in April, according to the median estimate of seven
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The state  statistics office  in
Ankara will announce the figures at 10 a.m. tomorrow.  
 Turkey’s  economy  grew an annual 11.7 percent in the first
quarter of this year, recouping most of the output lost a year
earlier when the global crisis dragged the economy into
recession. The central bank said last week that there’s
“growing uncertainty” about sustaining the pace of recovery
amid a debt crisis in Europe, Turkey’s main export market.  
 Recent data has “begun to suggest that the low-base driven
recovery is perhaps beginning to run out of steam,”  Timothy Ash , head of emerging market research at Royal Bank of Scotland
Plc in London, said in an e-mailed report yesterday. He
predicted economic growth of 5 percent this year.  
 The central bank’s  index of business confidence  fell in May
for the first month in six. Seasonally adjusted  quarterly growth 
slowed to 0.1 percent in the first quarter from 1.7 percent
three months earlier.
