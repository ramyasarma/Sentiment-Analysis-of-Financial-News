-- Half-Price Wine, Truffle Pizza Heat Up Monday Mobs at Accademia

             People were stacked three deep at the
bar and every table was taken. This wasn’t your typically slow
Monday night, given the raucous vibe at Accademia Di Vino as
patrons crunched thin-crusted pizza with truffle pate and
addictive fritters stuffed with Parma’s favorite exports,
prosciutto and cheese.  
 Even more surprising, the Upper West Siders, happily a
frugal crowd, quaffed $100 wines that were neither French nor
smuggled in from someone’s secret stash of an unknown Sonoma
winery. They were from Italy.  
 The draw? Monday night is bargain night at Accademia: Take
half off for reds over $80 and whites over $60. Same deal at
sister restaurants ’Cesca, a few blocks down Broadway at 75th
Street, and Accademia on the Upper East Side.  
 “Most people don’t have any experience of high-end Italian
wines,” says Anthony Mazzola, 66, managing partner of the
restaurant group.  
 Mazzola recently took over the spot vacated by Docks, a
seafood joint on the west side of Broadway between 89th and 90th
streets. He ditched the fish-house look of Docks, turning it
into a mini-Me of Accademia east (which seats 230; the Broadway
version seats 116), with barrel-vaulted rooms, high-top tables
for casual diners and better lighting.  
 Real Deal  
 Not to mention pretty good comfort food, well-enough turned
out to complement those wines, which are the real story here.  
 “I owned a wine shop, Sutton 57, and then moved to Italy,
where I spent a year and a half, going to every vineyard and
learning the wines,” Mazzola said during a telephone interview
from South Carolina, where he has a home and nurses plans to
open an enoteca in Charleston. “Italian wines are our strength
and where my love is.”  
 Looking to boost business on slow nights and to get patrons
to step up from $12 glasses of Soave at the bar, Mazzola started
wine night two years ago at ‘Cesca and quickly expanded to
include the Accademias.  
 “Some people come in every week just to experiment,” he
said. “Of course, we hope they’ll come back on one of the other
six days as well.”  
 So Many Choices  
 Chef Kevin Garcia is a bit like  Mario Batali  in overdrive -
- there are many crudo and tartare selections, pannini and more
pastas than you knew existed. The menu just goes on and on, and
you can go giddy reading it. We loved those $12 fritters,
perfectly fried, greaseless and light yet heady from the
parmigiano and teeny chunks of ham. And you’d better plan to
share the $18 pizza with robiola, black truffle pate and
pecorino because it will disappear before you’ve unfolded your
napkin.  
 I asked Mazzola what high-end wines to order with those two
delectables. A native of Sicily, he went with the Planeta Merlot
for a red choice, $85 on the list, $42.50 on Monday, for a
luscious mouthful of fruit with a deep, long finish. On the
white side, St. Michael Eppan Schulthauser, a pinot bianco, big
and slightly citric on the palate; $60 on the list, $30 on
Monday night.  
 I didn’t much care for a $29 filet of halibut sauced with
an apple and horseradish glaze that overwhelmed the fish and was
too sweet despite the horseradish kick. But the pastas ($19 to
$25) are reliable and anyway, I’d go to do what Mazzola intends:
try a big old complicated wine at a bargain price with a tasting
menu of appetizers. Maybe someday I’ll even spend $85 for a
merlot, though not, I must admit, any time soon.
