             The European Union’s energy chief
urged a ban on new offshore oil drilling until the causes of BP
Plc’s spill in the Gulf of Mexico are known, citing the need for
“utmost caution.”  
 The call by European  Energy  Commissioner  Guenther Oettinger 
is directed at EU national governments, which are responsible
for granting oil-exploration permits. The administration of
President  Barack Obama  is fighting to reinstate a temporary ban
on deep-water oil drilling that a judge threw out on June 22.  
 “Any responsible government would at present practically
freeze new permits for drilling with extreme parameters and
conditions,” Oettinger said in remarks prepared for delivery to
the European Parliament today in Strasbourg, France. “This can
mean de facto a moratorium on new drills until the causes of the
accident are known.”  
 BP’s Macondo well has been gushing as much as 60,000
barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico following an April
20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers. The spill, the largest
in U.S. history, has fouled beaches, killed wildlife and shut a
swath of fishing grounds.  
 The accident has prompted the  European Commission , the 27-
nation EU’s Brussels-based executive arm, to assess whether more
regulation of the oil industry is needed. In his comments to the
Parliament, Oettinger said he would meet with national
regulators on July 14.  
 “If proven necessary, we will not hesitate to come with
legislative initiatives in the coming months,” he said.
