             Japanese  bonds  fell, pushing
benchmark yields to the highest level in two weeks, as Asian
stocks extended a rally and the Bank of Japan raised its
assessment of the economy.  
 Thirty-year bonds dropped for a fourth day after a 600
billion yen ($6.8 billion) auction of the securities drew a
lower bid price than analysts had forecast. Japanese investors
boosted purchases of overseas stocks and bonds to the most in a
month, Ministry of Finance data showed today.  
 “The market has priced in deteriorating prospects for the
economy too fast and too far,” said  Hiroshi Nakamura , general
manager of fixed-income investment in Tokyo at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest banking group by
market value. “Ten-year yields below 1.20 percent are not
sustainable from a fundamentals viewpoint.”  
 The yield on the 10-year bond rose one basis point to 1.135
percent as of 4:16 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent
security due June 2020 fell 0.089 yen to 99.687 yen. The yield
earlier climbed to 1.165 percent, the highest since June 23.  
 The 30-year yield increased three basis points to 1.94
percent. Ten-year bond futures for September delivery fell 0.03
to 141.48 at the afternoon close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  
 Bonds dropped as the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average gained the
most in month, rising 2.8 percent, after a U.S. trade group said
retail sales in the world’s biggest economy grew at the fastest
pace in four years.  
 U.S. Economy  
 There’s little risk the U.S. economy will sink back into
recession, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said yesterday. “I don’t think we’re going to go
backwards,” he said in an interview with CNBC.  
 The BOJ raised its economic assessment in eight of the
country’s nine regions, saying conditions improved from three
months ago as the recovery remained intact. Central bank
Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  maintained his view the economy will
keep expanding on the back of rising overseas demand.  
 Japanese investors bought 1.061 trillion yen ($12.1
billion) more overseas bonds and notes than they sold in the
week to July 2, the most since the period ended June 4,
according to data released by the Ministry of Finance. Japanese
residents purchased a net 143.3 billion yen in overseas stocks,
the biggest amount since June 4.  
 Machine Orders  
 The decline in bonds was tempered after a government report
showed machinery orders fell more than economists estimated.  
 Orders , an indicator of capital spending in three to six
months, fell 9.1 percent in May from the previous month, the
Cabinet Office said in Tokyo. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast a drop of 3 percent.  
 “Given uncertainties surrounding the Japanese economy,
bonds will stay relatively firm,” said  Seiji Shiraishi , chief
economist at Japan at HSBC Holdings Plc in Tokyo.  
 China bought a net 735.2 billion yen ($8.3 billion) of
Japanese bonds in May, more than doubling purchases for this
year as it heads for the biggest annual increase since at least
2005. China’s purchases of Japanese bonds exceeded sales by 1.28
trillion yen since January, after net sales of 78.7 billion yen
for the whole of 2009, according to  data  released by Japan’s  
 The 30-year auction had a lowest-accepted price of 106.20
yen, below the median forecast for 106.50 yen in a Bloomberg
News survey.  
 “The weak result seems to show investors’ reluctance to
buy debt at beyond-fair-value levels,” said  Satoshi Yamada ,
chief quantitative analyst in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities
Inc., a unit of Japan’s third-largest banking group.  
 The difference in yield, or  spread , between 10- and 30-year
debt shrank to 74 basis points on July 2, the narrowest since
May 2009. It widened to 80.5 basis points today.
