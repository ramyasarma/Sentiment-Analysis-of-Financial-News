             Ford Motor Co.  Chief Executive
Officer  Alan Mulally  and  Walt Disney Co.  CEO  Robert Iger  are
among 18 executives President  Barack Obama  will name today to an
advisory group on increasing U.S. exports.  
 “Boosting America’s exports strengthens our economic
growth and supports millions of good, high-paying American
jobs,” Obama said in a statement.

agricultural exports increased 19 percent during this year’s
first quarter.

increasing U.S. exports, highlighting 18 trade missions
coordinated by the Department of Commerce, loans from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank that have helped support almost 110,000 jobs,
and new agreements on exports of U.S. agricultural products.  
 The White House said Obama will name members to the export
council to join  Boeing Co.  Chairman and CEO  James McNerney  and
 Xerox Corp.  Chairman and CEO  Ursula Burns , who were picked in
March to lead the group.  
 Appointees to the council, the White House said, will
include:  United Parcel Service Inc.  Chairman and CEO  Scott Davis ;  MetLife Inc.  Chairman and CEO  Robert Henrikson ;  Pfizer
Inc.  Chairman and CEO  Jeffrey Kindler ;  Verizon Communications
Inc.  Chairman and CEO  Ivan Seidenberg ;  Archer Daniels Midland
Co.  Chairman and CEO  Patricia Woertz ; and  UAL Corp.  Chairman and
CEO  Glenn Tilton .
