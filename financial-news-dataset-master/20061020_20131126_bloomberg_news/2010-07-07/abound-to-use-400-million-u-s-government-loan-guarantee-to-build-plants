                  July 6 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- Abound Solar, the
Loveland, Colorado-based maker of photovoltaic, or PV, solar
modules, received a $400 million, seven-year loan guarantee from
the U.S. Department of Energy to expand an existing
manufacturing plant and build another.  
 Abound Solar said today in a statement it has raised about
$200 million in venture capital and private equity since 2007,
built its first production line in Longmont, Colorado, and begun
commercial operations.  
 Abound plans to use $100 million of the loan proceeds to
increase the capacity of its existing Longmont facility to 200
megawatts per year by the end of 2011. The rest of the money
will be used to help build a larger manufacturing plant at a
partially built industrial facility in Tipton, Indiana,
according to the statement. A spokesperson for Abound said the
company expects to complete the Tipton plant by the end of 2013.  
 When both plants are complete, Abound Solar will be able to
produce more than 840 megawatts of PV modules annually,
according to the statement.
