             The Australian dollar jumped to a
two-week high against the greenback as the nation added three
times as many workers in June as economists estimated.  
 The New Zealand and Australian currencies advanced for a
third day against the yen as commodities climbed, encouraging
demand for currencies related to economic growth. The Aussie and
kiwi extended gains after a U.S. report showed initial jobless
claims dropped last week more than forecast.  
 “Certainly the Aussie will outperform,” said  Tony Morriss , senior markets strategist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Sydney. “There’s still positive momentum
in the domestic economy.”  
 The Australian dollar appreciated 0.9 percent to 87.20 U.S.
cents at 11:42 a.m. in New York, from 86.43 cents yesterday. It
touched 87.91 cents, the highest level since June 22. The Aussie
rose 1.8 percent to 77.13 yen. New Zealand’s dollar advanced 0.4
percent to 70.57 U.S. cents, from 70.31 cents. The kiwi
appreciated 1.2 percent to 62.42 yen.  
 Australia’s employment rolls rose by 45,900 in June, a
statistics bureau report showed today. The median estimate of 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for an increase of
15,000. The jobless rate was 5.1 percent.  
 A strengthening job market may escalate pressure on
inflation, which Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  said on July 6 is likely to accelerate above the central
bank’s target range.  
 Cash Target  
 The RBA left its overnight cash rate target at 4.5 percent
for a second month and said consumer spending and business
investment are expanding. Swaps traders are betting the RBA will
raise its target rate by 0.13 percentage point over the next
year, a Credit Suisse Group AG  index  shows.  
 “Far from the economy slowing from the weight of interest-
rate rises, it’s actually accelerating,” said  Adam Carr , a
senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “Clearly
they’re going to hike again -- it’s just a question of when,
with August still the best bet.  
 Initial claims for unemployment benefits in the U.S.
decreased to 454,000 in the week ended July 3 from 475,000 in
the previous week, the Labor Department reported. The median
forecast of 36 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
drop to 460,000 from a previously reported 472,000.
