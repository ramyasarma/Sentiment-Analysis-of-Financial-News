             South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak 
may accept Prime Minister  Chung Un Chan ’s offer to resign after
the government lost in local elections and lawmakers rejected
its strategy for developing a new city, Yonhap News said.  
 Chung has repeatedly asked to step down and Lee is almost
certain to accept, Yonhap said today, quoting an anonymous
source in the Lee’s office. Min Yong Kee, a spokesman for the
prime minister’s office in Seoul, declined to comment.  
 Lee indicated in a speech last month that he would shuffle
the Cabinet after his Grand National Party suffered a surprise
loss in local elections on June 2. He will change half a dozen
ministers before parliamentary by-elections on July 28 and may
replace his chief of staff, Yonhap said today.  
 The  National Assembly  on June 30 rejected the government’s
proposal to revise a plan to move nine ministries and four
government agencies to  Sejong City , 150 kilometers (93 miles)
south of Seoul. Chung was a proponent of the revision, which
instead sought to encourage companies such as Samsung Group to
invest in the town.  
 Samsung,  Lotte Group , Hanwha Group and Woongjin Group
pledged 4.4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) of investment in Sejong
City under the new plan. Chung said in January that at least
16.5 trillion won would be spent on the project, adding that
investment would increase as more companies and universities
moved there, given tax incentives and other benefits. More than
5 trillion won has already been spent.
