             Sugar output in India, the world’s
largest user, may be more than a government forecast because of
an increase in the area planted to cane, a millers’ group said.  
 Production may total 25 million metric tons in the year
starting Oct. 1, from 18.7 million tons estimated this season,
M.N. Rao, deputy director general of the  Indian Sugar Mills
Association , or ISMA, said today. Output may be 23 million tons,
the government said last month.  
 Increased output from the second-biggest producer may add
to a forecast for a global surplus of 5.64 million tons for the
2010-11 season by Fortis Bank Nederland and VM Group. A bigger
cane crop may prompt the government to levy a tax on imports in
August or September, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  said this week.
The nation allowed duty-free imports as prices doubled last year
after dry weather cut local production and excess rainfall
damaged crops in Brazil, the biggest grower.  
 White sugar for October delivery declined as much as 1.6
percent to $494.1 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in
October dropped as much as 1.7 percent to 16.41 cents a pound in
after-hours trading on ICE Futures U.S.  
 The price at Vashi in Mumbai, the nation’s biggest market
for sugar, fell 0.9 percent to 2,686.35 rupees for 100 kilograms,
extending this year’s loss to 26 percent.  
 Farmers planted cane in 4.72 million hectares as of July 2,
up 13 percent from the same date a year ago, the farm ministry
said July 2. The crop area is 22 percent larger than a year ago,
and higher than the increase estimated by the government,  Vinay Kumar , managing director of a producers’ group that accounts for
almost half of the nation’s production, said July 1.  
 India’s sugar stockpiles will jump 53 percent in the year
ending Sept. 30, according to ISMA. Mills will end the season
with 4.9 million tons, compared with 3.2 million tons a year
earlier, the group said on June 14.
