             The Czech Republic had a trade
surplus for a 17th month in a row in May as improving demand for
exports helped support economic recovery.  
 The monthly surplus was 12.3 billion koruna ($609 million),
the Prague-based statistics office said on its website today.
The median estimate of 10 economists in the Bloomberg survey was
for a surplus of 14 billion koruna.  
 The Czech Republic is recovering from the worst recession
since the end of communism in 1989 after demand for its
products, such as cars made by Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto AS,
crumbled last year and pushed the public finance deficit to 5.9
percent of gross domestic product.  
 The economy grew an annual 1.2 percent in the first three
months of this year, the first increase in five quarters. The
Finance Ministry on April 29 raised its forecast for 2010
economic growth to 1.5 percent from 1.3 percent on expectations
of improved demand for exports, which make up about 70 percent
of GDP.
