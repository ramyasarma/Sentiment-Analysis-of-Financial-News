             Crude oil traded near a one-month low
in New York as equity markets declined, fanning concern that the
economic recovery may falter and impede fuel demand.  
 Oil erased earlier gains as the  MSCI World Index  declined
0.7 percent and the  Europe Stoxx 600 Index  dropped 1.3 percent.
China’s economic situation faces growing uncertainties and is
becoming more complex, the head of the National Bureau of
Statistics was quoted today as saying in the bureau’s newspaper.
The country is the world’s second-largest crude consumer.  
 “We see rather weak equity data, rather weak economic
indicators,” said  Hannes Loacker , an analyst at Raiffeisen
Zentralbank Oesterreich in Vienna. “There’s still this
correlation. The most important thing is China. If growth fears
in China increase, that’s not good for commodities.”  
 Oil for August delivery traded at $71.97 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 10:58 a.m. London time. The
contract fell yesterday to $71.98, its lowest level since June
8, and has lost 8.7 percent in seven days.  
 Brent crude for August was up 3 cents at $71.48 a barrel on
London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 The U.S. Energy Department may say tomorrow that
inventories of crude oil probably dropped last week as Hurricane
Alex crossed the Gulf of Mexico, curbing domestic production and
imports, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Stockpiles fell 2.75 million barrels in the seven days
ended July 2 from 363.1 million the week before, according to
the median of eight analyst estimates. Seven of the respondents
forecast a decrease and one estimated a gain.  
 The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will
publish its weekly report on supply and demand at 4:30 p.m.
local time in Washington today.
