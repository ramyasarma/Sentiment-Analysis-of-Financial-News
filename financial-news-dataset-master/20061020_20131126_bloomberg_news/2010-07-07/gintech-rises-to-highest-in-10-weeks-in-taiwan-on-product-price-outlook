              Gintech Energy Corp. , Taiwan’s
biggest solar-cell maker by sales, climbed to the highest level
in 10 weeks after its chairman said yesterday product prices may
rise in the third quarter.  
 The  shares  advanced as much as 3.1 percent in Taipei
trading to NT$96.6 and were at NT$95.4 at 10:06 a.m., poised for
the highest closing level since April 28. The benchmark Taiex
index fell 0.1 percent.  
 The market across regions for the company’s products
“isn’t bad,” Chairman  Wenent Pan  said yesterday at a
groundbreaking ceremony for Gintech’s third plant. Product
prices will probably be “slightly higher” in the third quarter
than in the second, he said.  
 Gintech is expanding to tap international demand for
renewable energy. Global sales of solar power panels will almost
double this year as developers seek to install systems before
governments cut back on incentives, according to industry
publisher Isuppli.  
 “Our orders for the second half are looking pretty good,”
Pan said, without giving any estimates. The company’s profit in
the second quarter was little changed from the first, Pan said
yesterday in Miaoli in northern Taiwan.  
 The company expects annual production capacity to more than
double to 2.2 gigawatts in 2013 with the new plant, from 810
megawatts currently, Pan said. One megawatt can power about 800
U.S. homes.  
 Net income was NT$1.04 billion ($32 million) in the first
quarter, compared with a loss of NT$360 million a year earlier,
according to a company filing to the stock exchange on April 30.  
 U.S. President  Barack Obama  on July 3 announced $1.85
billion in loan guarantees to Abengoa SA of Spain and Abound
Solar Inc. to build sun-powered facilities in the U.S.
