             LeBron James  may reveal which
National Basketball Association team he’ll sign with during an
hour-long special on ESPN tomorrow, the network said, citing
people it did not identify.  
 James’s representatives contacted ESPN about making the
free agent’s decision public on July 8 at 9 p.m. New York time,
the sports network said on its website last night. James’s
representatives requested that sponsorships be sold to benefit
the  Boys and Girls Clubs of America , ESPN said in its report.  
 James had meetings with six teams, including the Cleveland
Cavaliers, where he spent his first seven years in the NBA. He
also held discussions with the New York Knicks, the New Jersey
Nets, the Miami Heat, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Chicago
Bulls.  
 ESPN spokesman  Josh Krulewitz  declined to comment. James’s
publicist  Keith Estabrook  didn’t immediately return a voicemail
seeking comment. Angela Richmond, a spokeswoman for the Boys and
Girls Clubs of America, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail.
