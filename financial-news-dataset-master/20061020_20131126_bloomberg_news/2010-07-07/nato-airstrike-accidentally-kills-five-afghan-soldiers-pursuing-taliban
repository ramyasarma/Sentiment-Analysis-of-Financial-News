             NATO fighter planes bombed Afghan
troops preparing to ambush Taliban guerrillas in a southern
province, killing at least five soldiers in a predawn “friendly
fire” incident, Afghan police said today.  
 Afghan forces were targeting insurgents in the Andar
district of Ghazni province when jets “mistakenly did an
airstrike on the Afghan army” at 4 a.m. local time, General
Khial Baz Sherzai, the provincial police chief, said in a
telephone interview. Two other troops were wounded, he said.  
 NATO is “investigating the incident and we offer our
condolences,” a spokesman for the military alliance said in a
telephone call from  Kabul , confirming deaths in the district
from friendly fire. He declined to identify the nationalities of
the soldiers killed and wouldn’t comment on which country’s
pilots carried out the bombing.  
 A spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, General  Zahir Azimy , condemned the attack.  
 The incident comes three days after the new commander in
the Afghan war, U.S. Army General  David Petraeus , arrived in the
country to pursue a joint civilian and military campaign against
Taliban guerrillas in the nine-year conflict.  
 The U.S. and its allies are pursuing economic and social
development work in Afghanistan alongside the expanded military
offensive ordered by President  Barack Obama  in an attempt to
weaken the Taliban.  
 Training Program  
 Training Afghan forces is central to the administration’s
strategy. Obama says he intends to begin a troop drawdown in
July 2011 and that enough Afghan soldiers by then will be
capable enough to begin taking control of their nation’s
security.  
 The U.S., which has spent $27 billion since 2002 for
training Afghan forces, and 45 allies have 142,000 troops in
Afghanistan.  
 Similar “friendly fire” assaults by U.S.-led NATO forces
have killed Afghan soldiers in each year during the war,
prompting protests from the Afghan government and vows by Afghan
and NATO officials to improve coordination between their units.  
 A night-time U.S. airstrike killed four Afghan troops in
Wardak province, east of Ghazni, on Jan. 30, the Afghan Defense
Ministry said. German troops killed five Afghan soldiers driving
in a vehicle on the evening of April 2 in the northern province
of Kunduz.
