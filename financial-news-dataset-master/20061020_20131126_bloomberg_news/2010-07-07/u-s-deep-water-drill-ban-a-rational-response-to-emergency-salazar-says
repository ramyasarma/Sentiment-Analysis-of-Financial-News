             The U.S. government said a ban on
deep-water oil drilling is a rational response under emergency
circumstances and should be reinstated immediately.  
 Interior Secretary  Kenneth Salazar  said in documents filed
with the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans that his
department acted responsibly by implementing the ban in response
to “an unprecedented and ongoing disaster.”  
 U.S. District Judge  Martin Feldman  in New Orleans on June
22 threw out the temporary ban imposed by federal regulators on
oil and gas drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet. Calling the
ban overly broad and punitive to the regional economy, he
blocked the government from enforcing it.  
 Salazar asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans to
keep the ban in place while regulators appealed that decision.
Yesterday’s filing outlines Salazar’s rationale for upholding
the moratorium.  
 “Interior had to take immediate action to minimize the
risk of another spill,” Salazar said. “The stakes are even
higher now that it is hurricane season.”  
 President  Barack Obama  imposed the suspension on deep-water
drilling in reaction to the  BP Plc  oil spill, the worst in U.S.
history, caused by the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling
rig off the Louisiana coast in April. The ban is needed to
protect public safety, the U.S. has argued in court papers.  
 Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc.  and more than a dozen
Louisiana offshore service and supply companies sued U.S.
regulators to lift the ban, arguing they would suffer
irreparable economic harm from the suspension in drilling.  
 Louisiana Governor  Bobby Jindal  urged Feldman and the
appellate court not to enforce the moratorium, which he said in
court filings could eliminate as many as 20,000 of the state’s
jobs if the suspension lasted 18 months.  
 The case is Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01663, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). The appeal case is 10-30585, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans).
