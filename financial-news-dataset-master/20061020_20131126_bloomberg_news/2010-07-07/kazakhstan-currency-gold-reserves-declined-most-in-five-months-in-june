             Kazakhstan’s international currency
and gold reserves fell to the lowest level in five months in
June, the central bank said.  
 The stockpile dropped to $26.6 billion from $28.2 billion
the previous month, the Almaty-based bank said in a statement
posted on its website today. The reserves totaled $26.4 billion
in January, the bank said.  
 The National Oil Fund of Kazakhstan, which the government
created to guard against a decline in crude oil prices, grew 0.4
percent to $26.54 billion in June from May.
