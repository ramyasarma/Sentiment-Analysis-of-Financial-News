             BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance, the
world’s largest steelmaking coal exporter, shut a berth at its
Hay Point terminal in Australia today for more than a month to
carry out planned maintenance.  
 The closure of Berth 2 at the Queensland port will last
until Aug. 10, BHP Billiton Ltd. spokeswoman  Fiona Martin  said
in an e-mailed statement. The alliance is conducting work on a
fender, a cushioning device that absorbs impact at the berth.  
 Hay Point, adjacent to the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal, has
two berths and a capacity to export 44 million metric tons of
coking coal a year, according to the North Queensland Bulk Ports
Corp.’s website. The alliance, or BMA as it’s known, is a joint
venture between BHP and Tokyo-based  Mitsubishi Corp.
