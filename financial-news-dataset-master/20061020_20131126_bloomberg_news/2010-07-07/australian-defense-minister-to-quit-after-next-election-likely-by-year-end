             Australian Defense Minister  John Faulkner  will quit his job in the ministry after the next
national election, which Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  plans to
call by year’s end.  
 Faulkner is the second Cabinet member to step aside since
former leader  Kevin Rudd  was deposed June 24 to make way for
Gillard as head of the governing Australian Labor Party. Finance
Minister  Lindsay Tanner  announced on the day of Rudd’s downfall
he wouldn’t contest the next election.  
 Gillard, 48, boosted Labor to an election-winning lead in
opinion polls held within two days of her taking over. Rudd’s
support tumbled after he shelved plans to combat climate change
and announced a 40 percent tax on resource profits at companies
including  BHP  Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest miner.  
 “I wanted to announce this decision before an election was
called,” Faulkner, 56, who will stand for his Senate position
in this year’s election, told reporters in Canberra. “Julia
Gillard has my absolute support. We are well placed to win a
second term.”  
 The first Nielsen opinion poll after Gillard replaced Rudd
gave her a 10 percentage point lead over  Tony Abbott ’s Liberal-
National coalition, at 55 percent to 45 percent, according to
the telephone survey of 1,000 voters published June 26 in the
Sydney Morning Herald. That poll also gave her a 21-point
advantage over Abbott, 52, as preferred prime minister.  
 Staying in Parliament  
 “John has done a great job as defense minister and enjoys
respect from all those who work with him,” Gillard told
reporters in Darwin. “I thank him for acceding to my pleas and
agreeing to stay in the parliament.”  
 Faulkner became a senator in 1989 and first served as a
minister from 1993 to 1996 under then-Prime Minister  Paul Keating . He said he spoke this morning with Labor’s four living
ex-prime ministers  Gough Whitlam ,  Bob Hawke , Keating and Rudd.  
 “John Faulkner is a man of honor and integrity,”
Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said in an e-mailed statement. “He is a
pillar of our movement and a great friend and I know his
contribution will continue in other ways.”  
 Half of Australia’s 76 upper house Senate positions are
contested at each general election and senators serve six-year
terms. Faulkner’s seat as one of the senators from the state of
New South Wales is one of the positions to be contested this
year.
