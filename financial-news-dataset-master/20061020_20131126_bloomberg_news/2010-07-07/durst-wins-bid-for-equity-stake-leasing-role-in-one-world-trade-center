             The Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey chose skyscraper builder Douglas Durst as an equity
partner in 1 World Trade Center, the 1,776-foot tower under
construction at the Ground Zero site in lower Manhattan.  
 The agency chose to negotiate exclusively with Durst’s
closely held Durst Organization to serve as its partner,
overseeing leasing of the 2.6 million square-foot tower and
investing at least $100 million of equity into the project,
Stephen Sigmund, a Port Authority spokesman, said in an e-mail.  
 Durst, builder of Bank of America Corp.’s 1 Bryant Park in
midtown Manhattan, was chosen over Stephen Ross’s Related Cos.
