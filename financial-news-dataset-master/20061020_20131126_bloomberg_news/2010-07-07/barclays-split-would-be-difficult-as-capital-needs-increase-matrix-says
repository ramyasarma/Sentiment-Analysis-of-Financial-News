             Barclays Plc,  the U.K.’s third
largest bank, would need to raise 3 billion pounds ($4.5
billion) and possibly sell its stake in  BlackRock Inc.  were it
to spin off its investment banking unit, according to an analyst
at Matrix Corporate Capital LLP.  
 Barclays  would require the funding to separately capitalize
its investment bank if it chose to break-up the group,  Andrew Lim  wrote in a note to investors today. Barclays Capital would
need its own Core Tier 1 ratio, a measurement of its ability to
absorb losses, of 10 percent under proposals made by the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision , Lim said.  
 “This would make splitting up Barclays very difficult,”
wrote Lim. “It would have to raise a substantial amount of
capital and/or sell its 19.9 percent stake in BlackRock.”  
 Barclays should evaluate separating its investment bank and
wealth management unit to boost the share price by as much as 39
percent,  Christopher Wheeler , an analyst at Mediobanca
Securities wrote yesterday. The idea contrasts with comments
made last week by  Antony Jenkins,  Barclays’s retail banking
chief, who said that the bank believes in its “universal
banking model” which enables shareholders to benefit from
separate revenue cycles.  
 A breakup and sale of its BlackRock stake “would impact
earnings due to lost  dividend  income and result in a substantial
loss on sale given the fall in BlackRock’s share price,” wrote
Lim.
