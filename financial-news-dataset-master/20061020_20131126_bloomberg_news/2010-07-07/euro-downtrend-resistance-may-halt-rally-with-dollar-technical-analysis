             The euro’s rebound versus the dollar
to above its 55-day moving average will probably fade as the
currency approaches resistance to further gains formed by its 16
percent slump since the beginning of December, according to Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  
 The shared currency climbed 0.3 percent to $1.2566 on July
2, exceeding its moving average of $1.2551 that day. The euro,
trading little changed at $1.2621 today in New York, is
approaching the line defining its trend lower at $1.2750 and
will probably rise no higher than $1.30,  Lee Hardman , a currency
strategist in London at Bank of Tokyo, said in a report today.  
 “With such strong resistance still in place, it appears
unlikely that the euro’s recent bounce will gain further
momentum,” Hardman wrote. “It appears reasonable to expect the
euro to now experience a period of undervaluation in the years
ahead.”  
 The shared European currency may fall below parity with the
dollar, an “extreme undervalued level,” if Greece were to
restructure its debt or one of the euro members left the
currency union, Hardman wrote.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A resistance level is an area on a
chart where orders to sell a currency versus a counterpart may
be placed, potentially blocking an advance.
