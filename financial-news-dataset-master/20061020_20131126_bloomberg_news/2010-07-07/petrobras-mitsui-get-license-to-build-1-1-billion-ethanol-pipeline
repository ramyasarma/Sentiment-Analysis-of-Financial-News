             Petroleo Brasileiro SA ,  Mitsui & Co. 
and Camargo Correa SA got a preliminary environmental license to
build a $1.1 billion ethanol pipeline in Brazil.  
 The 542-kilometer (337-mile) pipeline, set to start up in
the second half of 2011, will link mills in the states of Minas
Gerais and Sao Paulo to the Atlantic coast, according to a
regulatory filing today.  
 Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil producer is
known, has agreed to pay 2.5 billion reais for stakes in ethanol
mills in the past six months as part of plans to almost triple
annual output of the biofuel to 2.6 billion liters (686 million
gallons) by 2014. The purchases include a 45.7 percent stake in
 Acucar Guarani SA , Brazil’s third-largest sugar maker by market
value.
