             (Corrects date and time-reference in third paragraph.)  
 China is home to half of the world’s
eight biggest lenders by value after Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd.’s initial public offering gave it a projected market
capitalization of $126 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. has held the top
slot almost continuously since July 2007, when it overtook
Citigroup Inc. ICBC made its trading debut in October 2006 after
what was then the largest-ever IPO at $21.9 billion, which
Agricultural Bank may beat if an overallotment option is used.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY shows the values of the five biggest
banks in dollars based on July 6 prices and those at the end of
each year since 2006, when New York-based Citigroup was top-
ranked. Beijing-based Agricultural Bank, China’s largest lender
by number of customers, would rank eighth based on its projected
value before the over-allotment.  
 Shares “will fly between 20 to 30 percent” above the IPO
price, Liu Yang, chairwoman of Atlantis Investment Management
Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
today. “Overall, the Chinese banking sector deserves a re-
rating” after concerns of government tightening on property
lending eases.  
 Agricultural Bank is raising at least $19.2 billion in
Shanghai and Hong Kong, people with knowledge of the pricing
said yesterday. The lender priced Hong Kong shares at HK$3.20
apiece, said two of the people, who declined to be identified
before an announcement. The bank is selling shares in Shanghai
at 2.68 yuan (40 cents) each, three people said. Trading in
Shanghai is due to begin July 15 and in Hong Kong the next day.  
 London-based HSBC Holdings Plc was the most-valuable lender
for brief periods in September and October 2008, after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
