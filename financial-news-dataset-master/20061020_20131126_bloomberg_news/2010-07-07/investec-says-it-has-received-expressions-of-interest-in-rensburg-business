             Investec Plc , the South African
investment and private bank, said it has received “a number of
expressions of interest” in the money management unit of
 Rensburg Sheppards Plc .  
 There are “potential acquirers” for Rensburg Fund
Management Ltd., Investec said in a statement released in London
and Johannesburg today. The bank appointed Fenchurch Advisory
Partners to consult on “strategic options” for the unit.  
 Investec, which has its own fund management division called
Investec Asset Management, in March offered about 218 million
pounds ($330 million) for the 53 percent of Rensburg it didn’t
already own, seeking to add 12.3 billion pounds of assets.  
 Fenchurch will assess the interest from third parties for
acquiring Rensburg Fund Management and also “consider the
prospects for the continued growth of the business under its
existing ownership structure,” Investec said, without
specifying or giving any names.  
 Investec rose 0.2 percent to 54.09 rand as of 1:39 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading.
