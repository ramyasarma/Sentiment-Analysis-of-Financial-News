             India’s telecom commission will meet 
today to take a decision on listing shares in Bharat Sanchar 
Nigam Ltd. and selling a 30 percent stake in the state-run 
telephone company, the Economic Times reported.   
 Opposition from labor unions has delayed the company’s 
plans to sell shares for more than two years, the newspaper 
said. The board has approved plans for an initial public 
offering three times in the last 30 months, the Times said.  
 The telecom commission will also discuss BSNL’s plans to 
separate its land holdings from the parent company, the 
newspaper said.
