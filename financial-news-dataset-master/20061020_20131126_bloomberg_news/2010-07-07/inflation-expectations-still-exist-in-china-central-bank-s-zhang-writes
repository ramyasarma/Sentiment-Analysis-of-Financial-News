             Inflationary expections still exist
in China even though inflation won’t be a “major problem” for
the country this year, Zhang Jianhua, director of the research
bureau of the People’s Bank of China, wrote in today’s China
Daily.  
 Inflation currently exceeds the benchmark one-year deposit
rate and while negative real interest rates won’t affect the
economy in the short term, in the long term, they will trigger
resource misallocation, he said in a commentary.  
 The bank needs to monitor inflation especially after
massive amounts of liquidity were injected into the market last
year, he said. The effects of that liquidity will surface sooner
or later “and we must deal with it,” he wrote.  
 China’s economy is likely to grow by around 9 percent this
year on a “conservative” estimate, Zhang wrote. While growth
will slow moderately in the second half, there is no need to
worry about a double-dip slowdown, he said.
