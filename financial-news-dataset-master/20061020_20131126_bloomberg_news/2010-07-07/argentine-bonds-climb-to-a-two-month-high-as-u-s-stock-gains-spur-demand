             Argentine benchmark dollar bonds rose
to their highest price in more than two months as a global stock
rally prompted investors to buy higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  
 The yield on the country’s 7 percent dollar bonds due in
2015 slid 36 basis points, or 0.36 percentage point, to 12.2
percent at 4:25 p.m. New York time, according to pricing from
Deutsche Bank AG. The price rose 1.25 cents to 82.25 cents on
the dollar, the highest since April 26.  
 U.S. benchmark indexes rose the most since May as growth in
American retail sales bolstered optimism in the earnings season
and investors speculated European banks will pass stress tests.  
 “Global risk appetite will remain the main driver at least
in the short term” for Argentine debt, RBS Securities Inc.
economist  Boris Segura  said in a telephone interview today from
Stamford, Connecticut.  
 Argentina has scrapped plans to swap dollar bonds due in
2012 to extend maturities on the notes, known as Bodens, El
Cronista reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  
 The government will tap central bank reserves to make
payments on the bonds, including a $2.2 billion cash payout next
month, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said. Global market
turbulence has pushed Argentine yields to levels above what the
government is willing to pay on new notes in a restructuring,
the newspaper said.  
 Economy Ministry spokesman Sergio Poggi didn’t return calls
seeking comment.  
 Argentina’s peso rose 0.1 percent to 3.9334 per dollar from
3.9359 yesterday.
