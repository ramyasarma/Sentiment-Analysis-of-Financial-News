             Trading of bullish  Madison Square
Garden Inc . options surged to a record, one day before LeBron
James announces whether he will leave the  Cleveland Cavaliers 
for the  New York Knicks  or another basketball team.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY shows that 15,679 call options linked
to shares of Madison Square Garden, which owns the venue where
the Knicks play, traded today. The most-active contracts were
July $22.50 calls as the shares surged 6.4 percent to $21.57.  
 James, the National Basketball Association’s Most Valuable
Player the past two seasons, will announce his decision tomorrow
at 9 p.m. New York time, according to his website. If he joins
the Knicks, Madison Square Garden earnings would rise to a
record, Crain’s reported June 21, citing Patrick Rishe, a
professor of economics at Webster University.  
 “There’s been call buying on speculation that he’d sign
with the Knicks,” said Joe Kunkle, founder of OptionsHawk.com,
a Boston-based provider of options market data and analytics.
“There’s definitely a bullish bias because there are a lot more
people buying the calls.”  
 This month’s options expire on July 16. Madison Square
Garden’s highest closing price since the shares began trading in
January was $22.33 on April 12.
