             German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said there’s “not the slightest doubt” that the
government and utilities will agree to extend the running time
of the country’s nuclear plants. “There’s no dispute” in
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition that there will be an
extension, he told reporters in Berlin today.
