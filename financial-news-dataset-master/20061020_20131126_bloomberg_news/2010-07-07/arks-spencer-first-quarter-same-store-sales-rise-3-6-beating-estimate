             Marks & Spencer Group Plc , the U.K.’s
largest clothing retailer, said it’s “cautious” about the
outlook for consumer spending after reporting slowing first-
quarter sales growth.  
 A proposed increase in U.K. value-added tax and other
measures to curb the country’s budget deficit are likely to damp
consumer confidence, the London-based company said today. Sales
at U.K. stores open at least a year rose 3.6 percent in the
period ended July 3, slower than the previous quarter’s 5.1
percent increase.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  maintained guidance
for “flat” gross margins this year on a conference call with
journalists today. The retailer has been adding new food
products such as grilled meat for summer barbecues and holiday
clothing ranges to drive sales as Britons pare spending.  
 “A cautious outlook and no change to gross margin
guidance” is weighing on the share price,  Greg Lawless  an
analyst at Collins Stewart said. He recommends investors hold
the stock.  
 Marks & Spencer fell as much as 3.7 percent in London
trading. The  shares  were down 8.4 pence, or 2.4 percent, to
344.3 pence as of 9:15 a.m. local time as the U.K. benchmark
FTSE 100 Index fell 1.1 percent. The Marks & Spencer price had
advanced 7 percent in the three trading days prior to the
statement.  
 Sales Growth  
 The sales growth beat the 2.3 percent median estimate of
18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Same-store sales at the food
division rose 1.5 percent, matching the median analyst estimate,
driven by the addition of more than 500 new products such as
gluten-free bakery goods, Director  John Dixon  said. Revenue on
the same basis gained 6 percent at the general merchandise
division, more than the 3.5 percent median estimate.  
 M&S increased market share by 0.5 percentage point in
general merchandise and 0.1 percentage point in food, Bolland
said.  
 “Momentum in general merchandise persisted and share gains
are now more apparent given the weaker backdrop,”  Matthew McEachran , an analyst at Singer Capital, said in a report.  
 Sales at M&S Direct, the company’s online unit, rose 49
percent. The new website allows customers to check whether items
are in stock and place orders to collect in Marks & Spencer
stores.  
 Remuneration Report  
 Chairman  Stuart Rose  dismissed suggestions of a shareholder
rebellion at next week’s annual general meeting after
yesterday’s criticism by the Pensions & Investment Research
Consultants Ltd. PIRC called for the investors to oppose the
remuneration report, which included “highly excessive”
executive pay and concern over Bolland’s recruitment incentives.  
 “I can’t predict what they are going to vote, but I’m
confident that all our resolutions will be passed adequately,”
Rose said.  
 Bolland said the company is in the process of appointing a
new finance director ahead of  Ian Dyson ’s move to  Punch Taverns
Plc  at the end of August. He declined to comment on candidates.  
 The CEO, who is in his ninth week at the helm, said he has
been meeting suppliers in China and Hong Kong, visiting stores
and meeting customers ahead of his strategic review, expected at
the interim results in November.
