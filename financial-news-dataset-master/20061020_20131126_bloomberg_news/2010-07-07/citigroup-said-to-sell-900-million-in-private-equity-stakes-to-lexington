             Citigroup Inc. agreed to sell about
$900 million of private-equity investments to Lexington Partners
Inc., in a plan announced last year to shrink the U.S. bank’s
assets, people with knowledge of the matter said.  
 The lender is selling buyout investments made under its
decade-old  Citi Private Equity  unit, which was put up for sale
last year, said the people, who declined to be identified
because details haven’t been announced. Lexington will pay about
$900 million, one of the people said.  
 Citi Private Equity, which was formed in 2000 and had about
$10 billion under management as of January including the firm’s
own investments, was among more than  two dozen businesses  that
Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , 53, tagged for sale or
eventual closure in early 2009. The divestiture plan followed
the New York-based bank’s $45 billion bailout by taxpayers.  
 Citigroup, 18 percent owned by the U.S. Treasury
Department, agreed in April to sell a hedge-fund unit including
$4.2 billion of assets to SkyBridge Capital LLC. In March, the
bank agreed to sell Citi Property Investors, a real estate
investment unit with a net asset value of $3.5 billion, to
Apollo Management LP.  
 Lexington, founded in 1994, has completed more than 270
secondary transactions and has more than $18 billion of capital
under management, according to the New York-based firm’s
 website . Lexington partner Wilson Warren didn’t respond to a
message seeking comment.  
 Citigroup’s transaction with the firm was reported earlier
by the website Private Equity Hub.  
 StepStone Agreement  
 Under a separate agreement related to the deal, management
of Citi Private Equity investments will be handled by La Jolla,
California-based StepStone Group, the people with knowledge of
the matter said. A spokesman for StepStone declined to comment.  
 StepStone advises institutions on private equity
investments. Clients include the Kuwait Investment Authority,
 New York State Teachers’ Retirement System  and State of
Wisconsin Investment Board, according to the firm’s  website .  
 Citigroup doesn’t publicly disclose the performance of Citi
Private Equity, which specialized in investing in other
managers’ buyout funds. Managers of such funds typically charge
fees for overseeing investors’ money and take a fixed cut of any
capital gains.  
 Pandit is keeping a separate buyout unit, Metalmark
Capital Partners, that started a new fund last year with $1.7
billion of capital commitments from the bank and its employees,
according to an April marketing brochure for Citigroup’s
alternative-investing unit.
