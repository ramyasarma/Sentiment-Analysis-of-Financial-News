             BP Plc is probing the resignation of
18 traders mainly from its Singapore operations, the Business
Times reported, citing an unidentified person.  
 The person declined to specify what BP was investigating,
the Singapore-based newspaper reported. The report said the
traders had made up almost its entire fuel oil trading team in
Singapore.  
 BP has since hired replacements and brought its fuel oil
trading operations back to normal, according to the newspaper.  
 Pek Hak Bin, BP’s Singapore president, yesterday said at a
presentation that the company is committed to growing its
business, the report also said.
