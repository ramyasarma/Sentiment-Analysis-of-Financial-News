             Toshiba Corp. , Hitachi Ltd. and  Tokyo
Electric Power Co.  are among six Japanese companies that will
form a joint venture to sell nuclear reactors and technology to
Vietnam and other countries.  
 The group, which includes Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,
Chubu Electric Power Co. and Kansai Electric Power Co., will
seek financial assistance from the trade ministry, they said in
a joint statement yesterday. The companies have set up an office
ahead of forming the venture this autumn.  
 Japan is holding talks for nuclear cooperation treaties
with India, Jordan, and Russia and has had preliminary
discussions with Vietnam. The trade ministry will work to speed
negotiations for the treaties, which are necessary for Japanese
companies to export nuclear technology, the ministry said in a
statement yesterday.  
 Russia’s state-run Rosatom Corp. has been selected to build
the first of as many as 13 nuclear power plants planned in
Vietnam by 2030, the government said last month. Japan, which
lost out to South Korea in December on a $20 billion atomic
contract with the United Arab Emirates, is competing in the
expanding global reactor market with France, Russia, Canada, and
the U.S.
