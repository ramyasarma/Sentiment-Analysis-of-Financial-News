             Cocoa arrivals from Bahia, the
biggest producing region in Brazil, declined 16 percent from a
week earlier, analyst Thomas Hartmann said in a weekly report.  
 Arrivals fell to 48,920 bags in the week ended July 4 from
58,449 bags in the week to June 27, the Salvador-based analyst
said. Total Brazilian arrivals were 63,748 bags from 68,583 bags
the week earlier, he wrote.  
 The drop in the past two weeks has “caused arrivals to
start falling behind the flows recorded in 2006 and 2008,”
Hartmann wrote. Arrivals fell 22 percent in the week to June 27.  
 A bag weighs 60 kilograms.
