             Australia’s competition regulator
further delayed the date for releasing its finding into the  BHP
Billiton Ltd.  and Rio Tinto Group iron ore venture, saying the
companies want to make additional anti-trust submissions.  
 The Australian  Competition and Consumer Commission , which
was due to announce its conclusion on July 22, has yet to set a
new date, it said on its  website . It’s the fourth time the date
has been delayed since the review began on Dec. 7.  
 Rio  and BHP, the world’s second- and third-largest iron ore
exporters, plan to combine mines, railroads, ports and
workforces in Western Australia’s Pilbara region in a 50-50
venture to save at least $10 billion. The deal is opposed by
steelmakers in Europe and Asia.  
 “We continue to co-operate with regulators and provide
information,” BHP spokeswoman  Amanda Buckley  said by phone
today. Rio’s spokesman  David Luff  was not immediately available
to comment.  
 Australia’s regulator said in March it will study whether
the venture and Rio de Janeiro-based Vale SA, the largest iron
ore exporter, will have a greater ability to coordinate supply
decisions.  
 The iron ore venture also needs approval from shareholders
and other regulators including the European Commission. Japan’s
regulator The Japan Fair Trade Commission last month began
reviewing the venture and said it will decide by July 16 whether
to approve it or conduct a further review.  
 Rio’s Chief Executive Officer of iron ore  Sam Walsh  said
yesterday the synergies of the deal are still “seriously
important.”
