             U.S. stocks rallied, with major
indexes gaining the most in almost six weeks, as banks advanced
and retail-sales growth bolstered optimism that consumer
spending is weathering a drop in confidence.  
 State Street Corp. , the third-largest U.S. custody bank,
gained 9.9 percent as second-quarter operating profit beat
estimates.  Macy’s Inc.  and J.C. Penney Co. climbed more than 2.8
percent as a trade group said retailer sales are growing the
most in four years.  AES Corp.  rose 11 percent after announcing a
stock buyback. Chevron Corp. and  Alcoa Inc.  rallied at least 2.8
percent as oil, copper and gold advanced.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index increased 3.1 percent to
1,060.27 as of 4 p.m. in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  jumped 274.66 points, or 2.8 percent, to 10,018.28. Both
gauges rallied the most since May 27, and the Dow closed above
10,000 for the first time since June 28.  
 “You’d expect to see a bounce in an oversold market,”
said  Quincy Krosby , chief market strategist for Newark, New
Jersey-based  Prudential Financial Inc. , which oversees about
$693 billion. “The market is focused on outlooks from
companies. That’s going to be crucial for investors to determine
the pace of recovery, and if it’s time to go bargain-hunting and
really put some money to work.”  
 Earnings Season  
 Profit for S&P 500 companies is projected to increase 34
percent in 2010, compared with the 27 percent estimated on March
29, according to more than 8,000 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The second-quarter earnings season starts next week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent yesterday on speculation earnings
growth will help equities rebound from their lowest valuations
since the bull market began in 2009.  
 The S&P 500 has in recent days been testing levels watched
by analysts who study charts and patterns. S&P 500 futures
rebounded at 1,035 in May and at 1,038 in June. The S&P 500’s
decline through last week started after the index failed to stay
above a level identified by chart analysts as bullish: its
average price in the past 200 days.  
 “A lot of people got bearish when 1,040 was broken and we
just as quickly broke above it,” said  Ryan Detrick , chief
technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in
Cincinnati. “In the short term it’s sucked in some of the bears
and could potentially be a case for higher prices. Back up to
1,120 is not that far away -- that’s a 50 percent retracement of
entire bull market.”  
 Bank Stress Tests  
 Stocks also rose today as people with knowledge of the
talks said European stress tests may assume a 17 percent loss on
Greek bonds, half of the worst-case scenario estimated by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. A total of 91 banks in the European Union
will be subject to stress tests, the Committee of European
Banking Supervisors said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Banks had the  biggest gain  in the S&P 500 among 24
industries, jumping 5.7 percent.  
 State Street  rose 9.9 percent to $36.63. The third-largest
U.S. custody bank reported second-quarter earnings per share of
93 cents, excluding some one-time items. The mean  estimate  of 15
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for profit of 72 cents.  
 Regional banks, consumer finance and credit-card companies
rose after the American Bankers Association said delinquencies
on home-equity loans and credit cards declined in the first
quarter for the first time since 2008.  
 Marshall & Ilsley Corp., Wisconsin’s largest bank, gained
8.6 percent to $7.62. Capital One Financial Corp. advanced 6.4
percent to $42.09.  American Express Co. , the biggest U.S.
credit-card issuer by purchases, increased 5 percent to $41.15.  
 Retail Sales  
 An ICSC-Goldman Sachs report showed that U.S. retail sales
rose 1 percent for the week ending July 3. Sales probably
expanded at an average monthly rate of 4 percent in the first
five months of the retail fiscal year that began Jan. 31, the
biggest gain since 2006, the International Council of Shopping
Centers trade group said in advance of its June report tomorrow.  
 Macy’s gained 2.9 percent to $17.91, while J.C. Penney
advanced 5.6 percent to $21.78.  
 “The improvement in retail sales numbers was enough to get
some people back in”, said  Paul Zemsky , the New York-based head
of asset allocation for ING Investment Management, which
oversees $550 billion.  
  AES  gained 11 percent to $9.86. The Arlington, Virginia-
based power producer said it plans to buy back as much as $500
million in stock.  
 Energy Stocks  
 Energy and raw-materials shares advanced 3.2 percent. The
 Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials gained
1.8 percent as the dollar fell, increasing the appeal of
commodities. The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, dropped 0.2 percent.  
 Chevron climbed 2.8 percent to $69.45, while Alcoa gained
3.3 percent to $10.55.  
 BP Plc  rose 4 percent to $33.19. Chief Executive Officer
 Tony Hayward , who is holding meetings in Abu Dhabi, may seek
support from Middle East sovereign funds after the oil spill in
the Gulf of Mexico halved its share price, UBS AG said.  
 AK Steel Holding Corp.  jumped 8.9 percent to $12.55 on
takeover speculation. ThyssenKrupp AG said it’s not bidding for
the U.S. steelmaker, according to Reuters.  
 The  NYSE Arca Airline Index  advanced 5.7 percent.  
  AMR Corp.  rose 5.3 percent to $6.74. The company’s American
Airlines unit said its June load factor was 86.8 percent, an
increase of 1.6 points from a year earlier. US Airways Group
Inc. gained 15 percent to $9.32 after saying its passenger
revenue per available seat mile rose 22 percent in June.  
 Cisco Systems Inc.  had the biggest gain in the Dow average,
rising 5.3 percent to $22.48. Pacific Crest Securities said the
world’s biggest maker of networking equipment may beat second-
quarter earnings estimates.  
 Relative Strength Index  
 The S&P 500’s 14-day  relative strength index , a gauge of
stock-market momentum, fell to 30 on July 2, the same day the
benchmark index closed at the lowest level since September. That
level typically signals it’s time to buy to analysts who study
price charts.  
 “Contrarian indicators are telling you the guys who get it
wrong are very bearish,” said  John Wilson , chief technical
strategist at Morgan Keegan & Co., which manages about $120
billion in Memphis, Tennessee. “That’s making me want to be
kind of edging into the market here. The initial part of the
move will always be met by disbelief.”  
 Lower S&P 500 Forecast  
 UBS AG reduced its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 to
1,150, citing slower profit growth and an unwillingness among
investors to pay higher valuations for earnings.  Jonathan Golub ,
the New York-based chief U.S. market strategist at UBS, cut his
forecast from 1,350, according to a report today. He also
reduced his projection for total 2010 and 2011 earnings at S&P
500 companies to $84 and $91 a share, respectively, down from
$87 and $97.  
 “Incoming economic data have been showing signs of
decelerating growth, producing a string of recent
disappointments,” Golub wrote.
