             Microsoft Corp. agreed to give
Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, access to coding for
programs including Windows 7 and Office 2010 in a bid to boost
sales to the government,  Vedomosti  reported.  
 The FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, will now
be able to certify Microsoft’s operating system as a whole,
rather than individual applications, which will clear the
company to win more state orders, the Moscow-based newspaper
said today, citing an unidentified company official.  
 Microsoft had about $1 billion of sales in Russia last
year, with about 10 percent of that coming from government
contracts, Vedomosti said.
