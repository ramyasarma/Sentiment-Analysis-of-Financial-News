             The U.K. government abandoned its
timetable for switching radio broadcasts to digital from analog,
a move that will delay the freeing of bandwidth for sale.  
 While the target of making the switch by 2015 remained
attainable, no decision will be made until half of all radio
listening was on digital equipment, Communications Minister  Ed Vaizey  will say today.  
 “We can’t impose this on an unwilling public, no matter
how persuasive the business case,” according to excerpts
released by his office of a speech he’ll deliver today in
London.  
 Labour Culture Secretary  Ben Bradshaw , who lost office
after elections last month, set the 2015 target for the switch,
which would make analog radios obsolete and requiring cars to
have their radios either converted or replaced.
