             LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault is France’s
richest man with a fortune estimated at 22.7 billion euros,
weekly magazine Challenges reported.  
 Arnault took over the top slot from Gerard Mulliez and
family, the owners of the Auchan supermarket chain. Mulliez was
still in second place with a fortune estimated at 19 billion
euros, the magazine said. L’Oreal SA heiress Liliane Bettencourt
came in third with 17 billion euros.  
 Challenges does the survey, which includes non-residents
who hold French nationality, every year. The wealth estimates
exclude personal property holdings, works of art, cars, boats
and planes.
