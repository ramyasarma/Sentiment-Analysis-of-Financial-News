                  July 7 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- Recurrent Energy,
an independent electricity producer, agreed to sell Sacramento
Municipal Utility District in California 60 megawatts of solar
power over 20 years.  
 The power will come from 12 five-megawatt photovoltaic
projects at locations in Galt and Elk Grove, California, that
are expected to be running by fall of 2012, the utility said in
a statement today.  
 The utility, SMUD, will pay San Francisco-based Recurrent
an annual average of 11.9 cents per kilowatt-hour per project,
based on the feed-in tariff rates for renewable energy
initiatives that enter operation in 2012. The contracts are the
first to be signed under SMUD’s feed-in tariff program that
began in January.  
 Different types of renewable and combined heat and power
generating facilities, of as much as 5 megawatts in capacity,
are eligible under the program. The utility said it has only
received applications for solar projects, with the volume of
submissions exceeding the program’s 100 megawatt limit.  
 SMUD is the sixth-largest public utility in the U.S. and
has been providing electricity to Sacramento County and a
portion of Placer County for more than 60 years.
