             Hungary recorded the biggest annual
increase in industrial  output  in May since December 2006 as
improved export demand and a revival in domestic demand helped
the country exit its worst recession since 1991.  
 Production advanced 13.7 percent, rising for a fifth month,
after climbing 9.7 percent in April, the statistics office said
in a preliminary report today. The median estimate of six
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 8.2 percent. Output gained
5.4 percent in the month, the most since January.  
 The first  European Union  member to get an  International
Monetary Fund -led bailout in 2008, Hungary cut spending to meet
the terms of its loan. The measures damped local demand and the
country is looking to the euro region, which buys 60 percent of
products made or assembled in Hungary such as Audi cars and
Nokia phones, to support its recovery. Production declined 22.1
percent in the year-earlier period.  
 “We have some real growth now, this is no longer just the
base effect,” statistician  Ildiko Miko  told reporters. “We’re
seeing some revival in domestic demand besides strong exports.”  
 Hungary exited its recession in the fourth quarter and
growth accelerated in the first three months of the year. The
 economy shrank  6.3 percent last year as exporters including the
local units of Alcoa Inc. and Suzuki Motor Corp. scaled back
output to cope with faltering global demand. The central bank
expects gross domestic product to grow 0.9 percent this year.
