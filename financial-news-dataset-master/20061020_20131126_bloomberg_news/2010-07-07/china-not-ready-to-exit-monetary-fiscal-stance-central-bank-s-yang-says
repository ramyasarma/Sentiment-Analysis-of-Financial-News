             China doesn’t have the economic
foundation to adjust its pro-active fiscal policy and moderately
loose monetary policy stance, Yang Guozhong, director of the
central bank’s business management department, wrote in the
China Finance magazine.  
 China should exit its monetary stimulus first while
continuing with its pro-active fiscal policy which can play a
more effective role in restructuring the economy after the
financial crisis, he wrote in the central bank’s bi-weekly
publication. Authorities should guide expectations for an
orderly exit from stimulus policies, he said.  
 Excessive liquidity is still the main problem facing
monetary policy in China and loan quotas are not the fundamental
solution, Yang said. The central bank should use market-oriented
tools including open-market operations, banks’ reserve
requirement ratios and, at the appropriate time, interest rates
to manage liquidity, he said.  
 The central bank’s policy goal of price stability should
factor in changes in asset prices, he said.
