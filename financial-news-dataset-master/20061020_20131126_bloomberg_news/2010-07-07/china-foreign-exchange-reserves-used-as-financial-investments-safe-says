             China is investing its foreign-
exchange reserves as a financial investor rather than seeking
control of the entities it is investing in, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said on its website today.  
 China will seek to defuse concerns about or opposition by
other countries’ where it is investing its reserves, the agency
said in response to questions about whether China would use its
record reserves as an “atomic weapon.”
