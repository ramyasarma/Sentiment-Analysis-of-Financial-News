             State Street Corp ., the third-largest
U.S. custody bank, reported second-quarter earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates because of a $251 million after-tax charge
related to its securities lending business.  
 Earnings per share rose to 87 cents from a loss of $7.12 a
year earlier, when State Street consolidated off-balance-sheet
commercial paper programs and wrote down holdings, the Boston-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts had expected
profit of 98 cents, according to the mean of 7 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 State Street recorded the charge, which reduced earnings by
50 cents a share, to replenish funds that managed money on
behalf of securities lenders. The funds invest cash deposited as
collateral by securities borrowers. The injection allows State
Street to lift redemption restrictions placed on clients in the
fall of 2008 after the funds suffered losses.  
 The move “demonstrates our commitment to resolving the
challenges resulting from the market turmoil over the past
several years,” Chief Executive Officer  Joseph L. Hooley  said
in the statement.  
 Second-quarter revenue increased to $2.3 billion from $2.12
billion reported a year earlier.
