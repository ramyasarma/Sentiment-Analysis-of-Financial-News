President  Richard Fisher  said that while the economy is slowing,
there’s little risk it will sink back into a recession and
policy makers have “done enough” to spur growth.  
 “I don’t think we’re going to go backwards,” Fisher said
in an interview with CNBC today. “I think we’ve done enough,”
Fisher said. “We ought to be very careful about not going too
far.  Interest rates  are zero. It’s not the cost of money that’s
the issue.”  
 Fisher said companies are holding back on investment
because of uncertainty over government regulations in areas such
as health care. He also said he expects the world’s largest
economy to slow in the second half of the year as the
contribution from business inventories wanes.  
 Companies are “hoarding cash, they’re holding back,
they’re not hiring people, they’re not building plant and
equipment at the pace we’d like to see,” Fisher said. “This
has nothing to do with monetary policy. We have been as
accommodative as possible.”  
 Analysts including  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist with
CIBC World Markets in Toronto, and former Richmond Fed President
J.  Alfred Broaddus  have said weakness in the economy increases
the chances the Fed would resume expanding its balance sheet by
restarting asset purchases.  
 Excess Reserves  
 The Federal Open Market Committee has held interest rates
at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and flooded the
banking system with more than $1 trillion in excess reserves.  
 Fed Governor  Kevin Warsh  last week said that any decision
to expand the Fed’s balance sheet should be subject to “strict
scrutiny.” Such a move could erode market functioning or
contribute to perception that the U.S. central bank is
monetizing the federal government’s deficits, said Warsh.  
 Asked about the prospect of additional asset purchases,
Fisher said: “I’m not ruling it out, I’m just saying we have
provided a lot of accommodation, there’s a lot of buildup of
liquidity, there’s a lot of cash.”  
 “Now it has to be utilized,” Fisher said. “It will be
utilized only if there is confidence in the future.”  
 Fisher said businesses should not worry about the current
rate of inflation. “Deflation, as is inflation, are tail
risks,” he said.  
 Fed presidents rotate voting on the policy making Federal
Open Market Committee, with Fisher voting next year.  
 The Labor Department last week reported that private
employers added a fewer-than-forecast 83,000 jobs in June after
33,000 a month earlier. In the first four months of 2010,
private employers added an average of 119,000 jobs.
