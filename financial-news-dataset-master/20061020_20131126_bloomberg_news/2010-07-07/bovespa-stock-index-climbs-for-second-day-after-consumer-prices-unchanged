             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index gained
for a second session, completing the biggest two-day rise in six
weeks, as traders pared bets for higher interest rates after
Brazil’s consumer prices were unchanged in June.  
 Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes ,
Brazil’s biggest homebuilder by revenue, climbed 1.3 percent.
 Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-biggest lender by market
value, jumped the most since October after Bank of America Corp.
recommended buying the stock on “attractive valuations.”   Tam
SA , the owner of Brazil’s biggest airline by market share,
gained as a rise in flight demand at its largest rival eased
concern that increased competition will spur lower prices.  
 “Everyone’s so worried about the market abroad, but we are
living through a very favorable moment here at home,” said
 Debora Morsch , who helps manage 700 million reais ($397 million)
at Solidus Brokerage in Porto Alegre, Brazil. “Inflation is
well contained and came out better than expected.”  
 The Bovespa stock index gained 2 percent to 63,283.80,
extending its advance since July 5 to 4 percent, the biggest
since May 27. Forty-seven stocks rose on the index while 18
fell. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap index  rose 1.1 percent to
1,170.59. The real rose 0.8 percent to 1.7586 per dollar, from
1.7796 yesterday.  
 Brazil’s consumer prices were unchanged in June from the
previous month, the lowest monthly reading since prices fell in
June 2006. The yield on the interest-rate futures contract due
in January, the most traded in Sao Paulo, declined two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.29 percent.  
 Cyrela Rallies  
 Cyrela gained 1.3 percent to 20.10 reais. Gafisa SA, the
second-biggest homebuilder, rose 3.5 percent to 11.80 reais.  
 Bradesco gained 4.7 percent to 31.52 reais. Bradesco will
benefit from “a favorable macro scenario in Brazil” and
“strong operating trends,” Bank of America analyst  Jorg Friedemann  wrote in a note to clients today.  
 Tam jumped 6.9 percent, the most since June 15, to 26.75
reais. Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, the second-biggest
carrier, climbed 2.4 percent to 22.28 reais after saying in a
regulatory filing today that demand for its flights increased 10
percent in June from the same month last year.  
 “The numbers should mitigate the outlook for a price
war,” said  Felipe Rocha , an analyst at Link Corretora in Sao
Paulo. “Investors see the risk diminishing.”  
 The Bovespa index trades for 11.7 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.1 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.1
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.5 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
