             Changsha Zoomlion Heavy Industry
Science and Technology Development Co. shares rose by the daily
limit in Shenzhen after the Chinese construction machinery maker
announced plans to list its stock in Hong Kong.  
 The shares rose 10 percent to 18.84 yuan as of 9:32 a.m. on
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the biggest advance since last
February.  
 Hong Kong shares may account for as much as 15 percent of
Zoomlion’s outstanding shares after the listing, according to a
statement from the company to the exchange.  
 Zoomlion also said first-half net income may rise by as
much as 100 percent from a year earlier to 2.17 billion yuan
($320 million), according to a separate statement.
