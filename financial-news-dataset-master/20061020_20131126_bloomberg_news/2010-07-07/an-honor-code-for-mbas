             Can getting graduates
to promise to do no harm rein in the excesses of the financial
markets?  
 The global financial crisis, Bernard Madoff’s $65 billion
Ponzi scheme and scandals at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have
heightened the need for top managers to rethink their role in
society, says Rich Leimsider, director of the Aspen Institute’s
Center for Business Education in New York.  
 His organization is helping coordinate a global movement to
get newly minted MBAs to swear a pledge modeled on
the Hippocratic oath taken by doctors. Created last year by
Harvard Business School students to counter a growing public
distrust of finance, the oath is being championed by Nitin
Nohria, a specialist in ethics and leadership who was scheduled
to take over as dean of the school on July 1.  
 “One of the things we’re hoping to do is force hundreds of
thousands of people in business to talk about and think about
their responsibilities,” Leimsider says. As of early June, more
than 3,300 students had signed the pledge, according to the MBA
Oath website. Leimsider’s goal is to get 6,000 graduates at 50
MBA programs to sign--a fraction of the 100,000 students awarded
MBAs in 2009 by 408 schools worldwide.  
 The oath consists of seven principles, including obeying
both the letter and spirit of the law, refraining from
corruption, opposing discrimination and exploitation and
protecting the right of future generations to enjoy a healthy
planet.  
 Not all Harvard business students support the project:
Slightly more than half signed last year. It’s “the knee-jerk
reaction by business apologists to the current financial
crisis,” Justin McLeod, 26, a Harvard business student, wrote in
the Harbus, a school publication.  
 The pledge is “well-meaning but in the end, very mushy and
not well thought out,” says Steven Kaplan, a professor of
entrepreneurship and finance at the University of Chicago Booth
School of Business. All business schools teach students to be
ethical, Kaplan says.  
 One who did sign is Larry Estrada, who was to begin work at
Goldman Sachs in Seattle after graduating from Harvard Business
School in May. “For me, it was a stake in the ground, to say
here are my values, here’s what I believe in,” Estrada, 30,
says.  
 If Goldman Sachs’s leadership had followed the oath’s
tenets, the company might not have entered into agreements to
sell to its customers mortgage-backed securities that a client,
New York hedge fund firm Paulson & Co., was betting against,
says Rakesh Khurana, the Harvard Business School professor who
worked with students in drafting the oath.  
 “There’s enlightened self-interest that doing good will
simultaneously be a benefit to society but also raise the
respect and legitimacy of the institution,” Khurana says.
