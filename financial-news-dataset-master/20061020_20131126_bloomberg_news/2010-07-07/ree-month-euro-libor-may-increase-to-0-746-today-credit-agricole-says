             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros may rise today, according to Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may increase to 0.746 percent, said Orlando Green, an interest-
rate strategist in London. The rate was 0.74 percent yesterday,
data from the British Bankers’ Association
showed.  
 Libor for three-month dollars may be little changed at 0.53
percent, Green said. The rate was 0.531 percent yesterday.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for three-
month loans may rise to 0.803 percent, he said. The rate was
0.797 percent yesterday, according to the European Banking
Federation.
