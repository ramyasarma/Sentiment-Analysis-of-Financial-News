             The U.S. raised its forecast for
natural gas production this year and said the threat of
hurricanes would boost prices.  
 U.S. gas production will average 61.26 billion cubic feet a
day this year, up from 61.22 billion estimated in June, the
Energy Department said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook. Gas
production will rise 2.1 percent from 2009.  
 Rising onshore output will offset declines offshore, the
department said.  
 Benchmark gas prices at the Henry Hub in Louisiana will
average $4.71 million British thermal units in the third
quarter, up 12 percent from $4.21 estimated in May, the report
showed.  
 “The risk of hurricane outages and the projected reduction
in drilling activity combine to strengthen prices through the
year,” the department said in the  report .  
 Prices will average $4.93 million Btu in the fourth
quarter, up from the June forecast of $4.76. For 2010, gas will
average $4.84, up from the previous forecast of $4.62.  
 Natural gas traded at $4.85 yesterday at the hub, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Offshore production in federal Gulf of Mexico waters will
average 6.01 billion cubic feet a day, down from last month’s
estimate of 6.13 billion.  
 Hurricane Disruptions  
 This hurricane season, estimated by the government to be
the most active since 2005, may cut gas production by 166
billion cubic feet through November, the department said,
unchanged from last month’s estimate.  
 Gas consumption will average 64.67 billion cubic feet a
day, down from June’s estimate of 64.93 billion and up 3.5
percent from a year ago. Demand from power plants will be 19.89
billion cubic feet a day, down from last month’s estimate of
19.92 billion.  
 The Energy Department also lowered its estimate for imports
of liquefied natural gas.  
 LNG imports will average 1.37 billion cubic feet a day this
year, down 9.3 percent from the previous estimate of 1.51
billion. LNG imports will rise 10 percent from a year ago.  
 “Higher prices in European and Asian markets will likely
divert LNG cargoes from the United States,” the department said
in the report.
