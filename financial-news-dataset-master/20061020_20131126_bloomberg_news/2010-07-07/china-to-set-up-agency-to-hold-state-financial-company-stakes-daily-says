             China plans to set up an agency to
hold its stakes in the nation’s state-owned financial companies,
the China Daily reported today, citing unidentified people close
to the matter.  
 Control of Central Huijin Investment Co. may be moved to
the new agency from China Investment Corp., the Beijing-based
newspaper reported. The State Council may also take direct
