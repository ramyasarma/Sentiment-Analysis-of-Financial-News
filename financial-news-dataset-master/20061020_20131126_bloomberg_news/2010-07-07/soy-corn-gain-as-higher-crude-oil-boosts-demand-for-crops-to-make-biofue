             Soybeans and corn rose in Chicago as
gains by crude-oil futures boosted the appeal of crops processed
to make biofuels.  
 Soybeans for November delivery increased 0.7 percent to
$9.06 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris
time, while corn for December delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$3.805 a bushel.  
 “A lot of the strength came from positive developments in
outside markets,”  Toby Hassall , an analyst at CWA Global
Markets Pty, said by phone from Sydney today. Advances by crude
today and U.S. and European equities yesterday helped boost
investor sentiment in grain markets, he said.  
 Crude for August delivery rose as much as 1.1 percent to
$72.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
speculation supplies in the U.S. fell last week, boosting fuel-
demand optimism. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  yesterday
climbed 0.5 percent, rising from a 10-month low.  
 Still, expectations of larger soybean and corn supplies may
curb grain and oilseed futures in Chicago, Hassall said.  
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture may raise its estimate
for the nation’s soybean stockpiles to 369 million bushels at
the end of the 2010-11 season from last month’s forecast of 360
million, Allendale Inc., a farm marketing adviser and broker,
said in a report e-mailed today.  
 Corn Stocks  
 The U.S. corn-inventory estimate may rise to 1.582 billion
bushels at the end of the 2010-11 season from 1.573 billion last
month, Allendale said. The USDA is scheduled to release its
latest forecasts on global agricultural supply and demand on
July 9 in Washington.  
 China, the second-largest corn consumer, may boost imports
10-fold to 10 million metric tons by 2015 as economic growth
fuels demand, said  Akio Shibata , chief representative for the
research unit of Marubeni Corp., Japan’s biggest grain trader.  
 Wheat for September delivery rose 0.1 percent to $5.0825 a
bushel. Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe
in Paris was unchanged at 157.25 euros ($197.93) a metric ton.
