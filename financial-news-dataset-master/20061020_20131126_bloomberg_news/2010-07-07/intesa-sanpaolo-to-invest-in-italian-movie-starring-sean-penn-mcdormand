             Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  will be the
first bank in Italy to take part in the production of a film as
part of a project to support the Italian movie industry. The
film stars Academy Award winners  Sean Penn  and  Frances McDormand .  
 The lender will invest 2.5 million euros ($3.15 million)
in the movie directed by Paolo Sorrentino, whose  “Il Divo” 
won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Festival in 2008, according to
a news conference in Milan today.  
 “This is the first time an Italian bank is part of a
movie’s production,” Chief Executive Officer  Corrado Passera 
said. Intesa in the past two years has lent more than 100
million euros to television series and filmmakers.  
 The movie, titled “This Must Be the Place,” will be
filmed in the U.S. and released next year. It will be the
English-language debut of the Italian director. Penn will play
a middle-aged rock star who becomes bored in retirement and
decides to find his father’s executioner, a Nazi war criminal
hiding in the U.S.  
 McDormand will play Penn’s wife.  
 The film will be coproduced with Medusa SpA, a unit of
 Mediaset SpA , the TV company of Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi , and other Italian, French and Irish investors. The
total investment will amount to 28 million euros.
