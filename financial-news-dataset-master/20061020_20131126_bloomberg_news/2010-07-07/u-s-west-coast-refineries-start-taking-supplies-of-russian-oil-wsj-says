             U.S. West Coast refineries are 
starting to process Russian crude oil after a pipeline from 
Eastern Siberia came on line, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing industry executives and analysts.  
 In a matter of months imports of Russian crude have gone 
from nothing to the current level of 100,000 barrels a day, and
the fresh supplies have helped keep the price of gasoline down 
in states such as California; traders had expected the East 
Siberia Ocean Pipeline to supply mainly Asia, but tankers 
started delivering to the U.S. West Coast, the newspaper said.
