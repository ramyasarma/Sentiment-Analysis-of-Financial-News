             India’s stocks fell the most in a
week after a former central bank governor said a plan is needed
to contain the fastest inflation in Asia, fanning speculation
that interest rates may be raised for a second time this month.  
 ICICI Bank Ltd. , the country’s second-biggest lender,
dropped 1.5 percent. The nation needs a “contingency plan” by
September to control prices as the pace of increases is showing
few signs of easing, former Reserve Bank of India Governor  Bimal Jalan  said yesterday.  Tata Motors Ltd. , the biggest truckmaker
and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, declined 2.2 percent.  
 “Investors should hold cash,” said  D.K. Aggarwal , who
manages about $100 million as chairman of SMC Wealth Management
Services Ltd. in New Delhi. “We expect the Reserve Bank to
increase interest rates by another 25 basis points this month.
Investors would like to wait for the earnings next week before
buying shares of companies that report good numbers.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 143.45, or 0.8 percent, to 17,471.03. The S&P CNX  Nifty 
Index on the National Stock Exchange lost 0.9 percent to
5,241.10. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.7 percent to 2,227.34.  
 ICICI Bank declined 1.5 percent to 846.2 rupees. Tata
Motors, maker of the world’s cheapest car, the Nano, decreased
2.2 percent to 750.95 rupees.  
 ‘Urgent Issue’  
 “Inflation is an urgent issue and we don’t have a package
as yet which can give us confidence,” Jalan, 69, who headed the
Reserve Bank from 1997 to 2003, said in an interview in New
Delhi yesterday. “We heard inflation will come down by March,
then April. It was supposed to come down by now.”  
 Consumer prices in India are rising at least twice as fast
as inflation rates in Brazil, Russia and China, the other three
nations that make up the BRIC economies. Central bank Governor
 Duvvuri Subbarao  is under pressure to raise interest rates in
the monetary policy meeting on July 27 after an unscheduled
quarter-point increase on July 2, the third since mid-March.  
 India’s rupee fell to more than 47 per dollar, the lowest
level since June 10, as  Securities & Exchange Board of India 
data showed overseas funds sold more local equities than they
bought on July 2 and July 5, reducing  holdings  from a record.  
 JM Financial Ltd. , Morgan Stanley’s former partner in India,
increased 2.1 percent to 37 rupees, the highest level in more
than a month. About 0.2 percent of JM Financial’s equity changed
hands in one transaction on the National Stock Exchange,
according to Bloomberg data. Buyers and sellers weren’t
immediately known.  
 Retail Stores  
 Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. , India’s largest publicly
traded retailer, climbed 5.2 percent to 464.65 rupees, the
highest level since May 23, 2008. India’s trade ministry sought
comments from local and overseas retailers on allowing companies
such as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  and Carrefour SA to open stores in
Asia’s third-biggest economy.  
 Shopper’s Stop Ltd.  gained  11 percent to 625.95 rupees.
 Trent Ltd. , a department store operator with a franchise
agreement with Tesco Plc, advanced 7.4 percent to 1,128.4 rupees.
Foreign direct investment in retail will help fund investments
in farms, food-storage chains and reduce prices, a Department of
Industrial Policy and Promotion  discussion paper  said.  
 “We view the discussion paper inviting the views of
industry on foreign direct investment in multibrand retail as a
positive for the retail sector,”  Manoj Menon  and  Amrita Basu ,
analysts at Mumbai-based Kotak Institutional Equities, wrote in
a note to clients today.  
 Fund Withdrawals  
 Overseas  funds  sold a net  2.2 billion rupees  ($46 million)
of Indian stocks on July 6, paring investments in the stocks
this year to 312 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 Indian companies will from next week report earnings for
the quarter ended June. Kotak Institutional Equities, a unit of
Kotak Securities Ltd., expects average earnings growth in the
period of 24.1 percent from a year earlier for Sensex companies.
