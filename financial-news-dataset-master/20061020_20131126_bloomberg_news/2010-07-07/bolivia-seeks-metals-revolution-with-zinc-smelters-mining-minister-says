             Bolivia will seek bidders for
construction of two zinc processing plants this year as the
South American country aims to start processing the metal, said
Mining Minister Jose Pimentel.  
 “The policies of this government are meant to start a
metals revolution,” Pimentel said yesterday in an interview in
La Paz. “Today we are exporting the large majority of our
minerals unprocessed, and we lose a lot of value.”  
 The country aims to process 50 percent of the zinc from its
domestic mines within four years, the minister said. Pimentel
said the new plants may be located in the country’s principal
mining states of Oruro or Potosi in southwestern Bolivia.  
 In 2010’s first quarter, the mineral-rich state of Potosi
exported $212.5 million in zinc, according to the  National
Statistics Institute.  Bolivia exported a total $465 million in
minerals in the quarter, the institute reported.
