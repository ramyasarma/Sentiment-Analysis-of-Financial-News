             Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest bank, plans to sell bonds denominated in U.S. dollars
due December 2015, according to a person familiar with the
offering.  
 The notes may pay about 92 basis points more than similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. will
manage the sale with RBC Capital Markets, the person said.
