             China is refusing to issue exit
permits to more than 10 North Koreans seeking Japanese
residency, the Asahi newspaper reported, citing unidentified
officials.  
 Some of the North Koreans have been living in Japanese
diplomatic offices in China for two years, the report said. The
North Koreans or their family members previously lived in Japan,
the Asahi said.   
 The Chinese government has asked Japan not to provide
refuge to North Koreans in China, the report said. Before
mid-2008, China had allowed the exit of North Koreans to other
countries, the report said.
