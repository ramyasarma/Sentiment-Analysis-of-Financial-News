             Rafael Soriano  of the Tampa Bay Rays
will replace fellow relief pitcher  Mariano Rivera  of the New
York Yankees on the American League squad for the July 13 All-
Star Game, Major League Baseball said today in a news release.  
 Soriano, 30, who is 2-0 with a 1.65 ERA and 23 saves in 24
opportunities this season, will be on his first All-Star team.  
 Rivera pulled out of the game because of a sore right knee
and discomfort in his left oblique muscle.  
 Rivera was selected by his fellow players, so his
replacement had to be the highest-ranking reliever in player
votes who did not make the original roster -- which in this case
was Soriano.
