             Kevin Durant , the National Basketball
Association’s leading scorer last season, said on his Twitter
account that he’s signing a five-year contract extension with
the Oklahoma City Thunder.  
 Durant posted the message on the social media website
today.  
 League rules prohibit the Thunder from commenting about the
possible extension, team spokesman  Brian Facchini  said in an e-
mail. Teams cannot sign players until tomorrow, when the NBA’s
2010-2011 salary cap is set.  
 Durant, 21, led the NBA with a 30.1 points-per-game scoring
average last season, his third in the league after being drafted
No. 2 overall in 2007, when the Thunder were based in Seattle.  
 He was named the NBA’s Rookie of the Year in 2008 and
earned his first All-Star nod last season, when he led the
league in minutes played as well as field-goal and free-throw
attempts.
