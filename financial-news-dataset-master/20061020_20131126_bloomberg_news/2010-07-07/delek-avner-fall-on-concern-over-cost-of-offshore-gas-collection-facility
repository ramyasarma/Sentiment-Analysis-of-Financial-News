             Delek Drilling-LP  and  Avner Oil
Exploration-LP , gas exploration partners in the Tamar field,
declined the most this month on concern about the costs and
duration of developing a gas collection facility.  
 Delek Drilling lost the most since June 29, retreating 3.5
percent to 9.49 shekels at the close in Tel Aviv. Avner dropped
3.5 percent, the most in five weeks, to 1.655 shekels, and
 Isramco Negev 2 LP,  another partner in the Tamar field, fell 3.5
percent to 0.49 shekel, the most since June 30.  
 “Gas companies are taking a hit on worries over the
possibility they will only get approval for an expensive off-
shore gas-collection facility,” said  Avi Weinreb,  a trader at
Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “The market was hoping
for a decision yesterday that the facility could be onshore but
no decision was reached.”  
 Israel’s Ministry of the Interior will look into additional
possible locations for the development of a collection facility
for gas from the Tamar and Dalit sites, it said late yesterday
in an e-mailed statement.  
 A report from the Ministry of Environmental Protection
presented at a planning committee meeting yesterday said the
preferred location for the facility is the city of Ashdod, which
is in the south of the country. Hadera would be best location if
the facility were located in the north, it said.
