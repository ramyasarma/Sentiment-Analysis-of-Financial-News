             Manhattan’s office vacancy  rate 
dropped for the first time in three years in the second quarter
as almost 7 million square feet (650,321 square meters) of
leases were signed, brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc. said.  
 The rate fell to 10.8 percent from 11.6 percent at the end
of March, Cushman, the biggest closely held commercial property
broker, said today in a statement. Rents declined for the
seventh straight quarter to $54.31 a square foot from $55.38.  
 “There are still some uncertainties in the broader global
economy that have the ability to derail a recovery, but in New
York City five straight months of employment growth suggest
business confidence is returning and the office market stands to
benefit,”  Kenneth McCarthy , Cushman managing director for New
York-area research, said in the statement.  
 Manhattan leasing improved as companies sought to take
advantage of rents that fell following the 2008 bankruptcy
filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and sales of Merrill
Lynch & Co. and Bear Stearns Cos. New York’s finance industry
added 6,800 jobs from the end of February through May, while the
city’s unemployment rate dropped to a seasonally adjusted 9.6
percent in May, the fifth consecutive decline.  
 The falling vacancy in New York, the country’s biggest and
costliest office market, contrasted with the national trend. The
U.S. vacancy rate rose to 17.4 percent last month, the highest
level in 17 years, according to Reis Inc.  
 Midtown Decline  
 Midtown’s  office vacancy  rate dropped to 11.5 percent from
12.6 percent in the previous quarter and 11.7 percent a year
earlier. The  average rent  landlords sought fell to $61.66 a
square foot from $61.93 in March. Rents slumped 7.7 percent from
a year ago.  
 The vacancy rate remains near high levels, pressuring
rents, McCarthy said in an e-mail. It was 5.3 percent in June
2007, near the market peak.  
 In Lower Manhattan, the  vacancy  rate fell to 9.9 percent
from 10 percent at the end of March. It was 8.7 percent a year
earlier. Rent declined 2.9 percent in the quarter to $37.81 a
square foot and dropped 14 percent from a year earlier.  
 Manhattan asking rents sank 26 percent since peaking in the
third quarter of 2008 at $72.97 a square foot, according to New
York-based Cushman.
