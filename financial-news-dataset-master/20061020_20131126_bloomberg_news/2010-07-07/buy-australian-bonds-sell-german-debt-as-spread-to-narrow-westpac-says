             Westpac Banking Corp. said investors
would benefit from buying 10-year Australian government bonds
and selling similar-dated German debt as the spread between in
yields between the two is expected to narrow.  
 The higher rates on longer-term Australian debt should
attract buyers, while the “flight to quality” that has
bolstered demand for bunds may fade,  Altaz Dagha , an interest-
rate strategist at Sydney-based Westpac, said today in a report.  
 Yields on German bonds sank to 2.59 percent yesterday, down
from this year’s high of 3.43 percent on Jan. 4, as investors
switched from peripheral euro-region countries, including Greece
and Spain. Concerns that some European nations will struggle to
curb budget deficits prompted the European Union to set up a 750
billion-euro ($945 billion) rescue package in May.  
 Measures from the EU and the European Central Bank “look
set to contain funding pressures and prevent any imminent
sovereign defaults,” Dagha wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients. “We also have a long-held Australia outperformance
view” because of demand for high-yielding, high-quality
markets, he said.  
 The difference in  yields  between Australian and German debt
narrowed to 244.92 basis points today, down from this year’s
high of 284.74 basis points on April 27, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The strategist said the gap may shrink to 215
basis points and recommends exiting the position if it widens to
260 points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
