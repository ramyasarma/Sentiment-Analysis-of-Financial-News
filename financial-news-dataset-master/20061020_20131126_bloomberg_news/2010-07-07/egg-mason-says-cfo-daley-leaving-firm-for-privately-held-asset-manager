             Legg Mason Inc.  Chief Financial
Officer  Charles J. Daley  is leaving the Baltimore-based money
manager after more than two decades at the company to take a job
at another asset-management firm.  
 Terrence Murphy , chief operating officer of Legg Mason’s
ClearBridge Advisors stock-fund unit, has been named interim
CFO, Legg Mason said today in a statement. Murphy, 42, was
previously the chief financial officer of Citigroup Inc.’s
asset-management unit, which was acquired by Legg Mason in 2005.  
 Daley, 48, a member of Legg Mason’s  executive committee  led
by Chief Executive Officer  Mark Fetting , helped the firm reduce
debt and bolster its balance sheet after losses stemming from
the credit crisis. Legg Mason didn’t specify which company Daley
was joining. The firm, which manages $658 billion, outlined
plans in May to cut costs and buy back as much as $1 billion of
its shares.  
 Cash placed in structured investment vehicles contributed
to five straight quarters of losses, a streak that ended in
March 2009 after the firm eliminated the mortgage-linked debt
from its money-market funds.
