 Cielo SA  and  Redecard SA  surged in Sao Paulo trading amid
speculation last week’s sell-off following the end of an
exclusivity agreement was overdone.  
 Cielo rose 3.3 percent to 15.85 reais, extending its two-
day gain to 9.8 percent. Redecard increased the most in three
weeks, jumping 3.2 percent to 26.10 reais, and stretching its
advance over the past two sessions to 6.3 percent.  
 Cielo , the country’s biggest credit-card processor by
market value, lost 9.2 percent last week as its exclusive right
to handle Visa-branded transactions expired on July 1. Redecard
plunged 13 percent in the same period. Investors overestimated
the impact of increased competition as the deal had already been
announced last year, said  Laura Lyra Schuch , an analyst at Ativa
Corretora, who has a “neutral” rating on both companies.  
 “There was no need to fall that much as the end of
exclusivity didn’t bring anything new,” Schuch said by phone
from Rio de Janeiro. “People have been talking about it for
more than a year.”
