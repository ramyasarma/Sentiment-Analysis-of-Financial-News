             Gold may rise to higher than $1,300
an ounce in the second half of this year, GFMS Ltd. Executive
Chairman Philip Klapwijk said in slides prepared for delivery at
a Beijing conference today.  
 “Investors will remain the principal driver of prices this
year, with a breach of $1,300 in the second half a strong
possibility,” he said in the slides.
