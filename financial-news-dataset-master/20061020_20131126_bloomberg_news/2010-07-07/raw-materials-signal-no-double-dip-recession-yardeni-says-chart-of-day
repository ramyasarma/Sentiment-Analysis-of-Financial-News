             Prices for industrial raw materials
are signaling the global economy will avoid falling back into
recession, according to  Edward Yardeni , president and chief
investment strategist at the research firm bearing his name.  
 Yardeni based his conclusion on the performance of a
Commodity Research Bureau/Reuters index of 13 materials for
immediate delivery. The indicator is among the best gauges of
the economy’s current condition, he wrote today in a report.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY compares the CRB index with the
quarterly growth rate for U.S. gross domestic product in the
past five years. They tended to rise and fall together during
this period.  
 Since peaking on April 26, the raw-material gauge has
dropped as much as 9.8 percent. Even so, yesterday’s close of
474.18 was about 50 percent higher than a low in December 2008.  
 “This CRB index suggests the global economy is slowing,
but not dipping,” Yardeni wrote. He was alluding to the threat
of a so-called double-dip recession, or the second slump in the
past three years. An absence of “financial contagion” will
allow the gauge to avoid a second-half plunge, the report said.
In the last six months of 2008, it tumbled 34 percent.  
 Five metals -- copper scrap, lead scrap, steel scrap, tin
and zinc -- are included in the  indicator . It’s also based on
prices for burlap, cotton, hides, print cloth, rosin, rubber,
tallow and wool tops, a processed form of wool.
