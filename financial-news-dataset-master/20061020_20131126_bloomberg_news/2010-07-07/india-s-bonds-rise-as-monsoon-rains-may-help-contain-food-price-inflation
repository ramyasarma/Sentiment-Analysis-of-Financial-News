             India’s  10-year bonds  rose the most
in more than a week on optimism monsoon rains will boost farm
output, helping contain  inflation .  
 Yields fell a second day after the weather office said the
entire country has been covered by the rains. The monsoon
usually blankets the nation by July 15. The wholesale-price
index of farm products fell to an eight-month low of 12.92
percent in the week ended June 19 from a year earlier.  
 “The rains are a positive because it signals food
inflation may slow,” said  Sanjay Arya , treasurer at state-owned
Bank of Maharashtra in Mumbai.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 declined
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.57 percent as
of the 5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The price rose 0.26, or 26 paise per 100-
rupee face amount, to 101.54.  
 The food inflation data for the week ended June 26 will be
published tomorrow. The monsoon occurs between June and
September, accounting for more than 70 percent of annual
rainfall, and is the main source of irrigation for the nation’s
235 million farmers.  
 Central bank  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last week increased
benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points each after wholesale
price inflation accelerated to 10.16 percent in May, approaching
the fastest pace since October 2008. The  reverse-repurchase rate 
is 4 percent and the repurchase rate is 5.5 percent.  
 ‘Contingency Plan’  
 India needs a “contingency plan” by September to control
 inflation  as prices are showing few signs of easing, former
central bank Governor  Bimal Jalan  said.  
 Inflation in India started picking up after a drought last
year created shortages in rice, wheat and sugar. It accelerated
as consumer demand for manufactured goods and services
strengthened. Last year’s showers were the least since 1972.  
 “Why didn’t you release more grains in the market to
reduce the impact of the drought?” Jalan said. “All the good
expectations are inflation will come down with a good monsoon
and I hope that will happen. But, the real issue is that if that
doesn’t happen, what should we do?”  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, fell to 5.65 percent from 5.71 percent yesterday.
