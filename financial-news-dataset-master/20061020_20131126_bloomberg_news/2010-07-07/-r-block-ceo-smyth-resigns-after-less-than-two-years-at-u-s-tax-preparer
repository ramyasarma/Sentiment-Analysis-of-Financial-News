             H&R Block Inc. , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, said Chief Executive Officer  Russell P. Smyth  resigned
on June 30.  
 Smyth’s resignation will take effect on Aug. 29, unless H&R
Block’s  board of directors  picks an earlier date, the Kansas
City, Missouri-based company said today in a regulatory filing.
Smyth, 53, was hired in 2008 after 21 years at McDonald’s Corp.,
where he rose to president of the company’s European unit.  
 Last month, H&R Block reported a 2.3 percent decline in
earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which often accounts for
all its annual profit. Smyth closed 400 under-performing tax
offices and cut 400 jobs after the company said in February that
it wouldn’t reach its fiscal 2010 earnings forecast.  
 H&R Block has fallen 32 percent so far this year, compared
with a 4.9 percent decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
That would be the worst annual decline in the company’s history.
The shares climbed 19 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $15.49 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 Former Securities and Exchange Commission chief  Richard Breeden  won a proxy battle in 2007 for a board seat, and brought
in Smyth after taking over as chairman when previous CEO  Mark Ernst  was ousted.
