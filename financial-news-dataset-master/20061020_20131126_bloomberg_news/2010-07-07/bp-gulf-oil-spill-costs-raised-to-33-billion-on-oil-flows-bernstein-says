             BP Plc ’s oil spill is likely to cost
a total of $33 billion, more than earlier forecast, because of
greater oil flow rates, Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note.  
 The company cut its price target for the stock to 400 pence
from 444 pence because of the higher costs and the greater
likelihood that BP will have to shoulder the full amount as
partners seek to avoid damages.  BP rose  for a third day in
London to close 4.8 percent higher at 362.05 pence as work
advanced on relief wells designed to permanently staunch the oil
flow from the ocean floor.  
 “We think it likely BP will experience a slight recovery
as the leak is stopped,” analysts  Neil McMahon  and  Iain Pyle 
said. “After that, however, we remain skeptical on the long
term prospects for BP. With limited production growth, reduced
ability to take risk, and low leverage to any rise in commodity
prices, there are other integrateds that are better placed.”  
 BP said this week it’s ahead of schedule on the relief
wells, which are due for completion in August. It agreed with
President Barack Obama to set aside $20 billion for cleanup
costs and liabilities from the spill, financed by canceling the
dividend, selling assets and reducing investment.  
 Bernstein said it sees “little chance” that BP’s U.S.
assets will be bankrupted. BP has “sufficient liquidity,” and
its trading business is unlikely to suffer significant damages
because of the spill, it said.  
 Macondo has been gushing as much as 60,000 barrels of oil a
day into the ocean, according to a government estimate. BP has
been capturing about 25,000 barrels of oil a day from the well
this month.  
 BP, the largest oil and natural-gas producer in the Gulf,
has spent $3.1 billion so far on containment efforts, cleanup
and legal claims. The spill, the largest in U.S. history, fouled
beaches, killed wildlife and shut a swath of federally
controlled fishing grounds over an area the size of Nebraska.
