             A decision by Eskom Holdings Ltd. to
raise its pay offer to labor unions will cost the utility 488
million rand ($64 million) more than planned under calculations
by the national energy regulator,  I-Net Bridge  reported.  
 The 9 percent pay increase is above the 5.6 percent used by
the National Energy Regulator of South Africa when it decided by
how much to let Eskom raise electricity tariffs, the
Johannesburg-based news service said, citing Bhabhalazi Bulunga,
head of human resources at the utility. The pay offer also
includes a housing allowance of 1,500 rand a month, it said.
