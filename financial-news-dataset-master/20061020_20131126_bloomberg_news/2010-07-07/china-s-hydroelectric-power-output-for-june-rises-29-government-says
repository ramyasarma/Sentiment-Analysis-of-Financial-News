             China’s hydropower production gained
29 percent last month, easing pressure on coal supply and
thermal-power units.  
 June hydropower generation rose to 71.5 billion kilowatt-
hours from a year earlier, the National Development and Reform
Commission said in a  statement  on its website today. Thermal
power output expanded 13 percent, according to the statement,
which didn’t give exact figures.  
 The nation’s daily electricity generation reached a record
12.9 billion kilowatt-hours on July 5 because of hot weather,
according to the statement from China’s top economic planner.  
 A total of 429 major power plants had 58.07 million metric
tons of coal stockpiles as of July 4, enough for 18 days of use,
up from 16 days at the end of May, it said. Inventories at
Qinhuangdao port, the nation’s largest transit port for the fuel,
stood at a “normal level” of 5.94 million tons, it said.
