             China has drafted new rules that
would fine food exporters as much as 30,000 yuan ($4,400) for
violating food safety regulations.  
 Violations would include exporting food containing illegal
chemicals or using raw materials from uncertified sources, and
falsifying food safety documents.  
 The proposed rules were posted on the General
Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine’s website July 6.
