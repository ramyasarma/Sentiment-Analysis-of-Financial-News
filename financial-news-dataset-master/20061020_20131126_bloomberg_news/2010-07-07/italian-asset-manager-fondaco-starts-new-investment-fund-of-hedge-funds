             Fondaco SGR SpA, the asset manager
controlled by four Italian banking foundations, raised 92
million euros ($116 million) for a fund that invests in hedge
funds.  
 Fondaco Select Opportunities, which started July 1, invests
in strategies including long-short equity and absolute return,
 Luca Vaiani , who runs the pool, said in an interview. Most of
the managers are U.S.-based, he said, declining to name them.  
 Founded in 2002, Turin-based  Fondaco  oversees a total of
about 3 billion euros, mainly on behalf of its investors, the
biggest of which, Compagnia di San Paolo, is also Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA’s largest shareholder. Fondaco Select Opportunities
is also open to other investors, and charges a 0.4 percent
management fee for investments of 50 million euros or more, and
1.5 percent for smaller commitments. The fund doesn’t charge a
performance fee, Vaiani said.  
 Compagnia di San Paolo, the Turin-based foundation created
in 1563, had assets totaling 6.9 billion euros at the end of
2009. About 53 percent of those assets are tied up in Intesa,
Italy’s second-biggest bank, of which it owns 9.9 percent. About
7.4 percent of the rest is invested in absolute return
strategies, according to the foundation’s website.
