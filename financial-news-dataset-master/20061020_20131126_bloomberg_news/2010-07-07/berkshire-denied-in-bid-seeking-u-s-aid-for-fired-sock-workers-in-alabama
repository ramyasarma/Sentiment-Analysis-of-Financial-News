             Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. failed to secure U.S. aid for fired workers at the Alabama
sock distribution plant of the company’s Fruit of the Loom unit.  
 The U.S. Department of Labor denied a Fruit of the Loom
appeal to enroll current and former employees of its Desoto
Mills LLC in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, according
to the Federal Register today. The department’s decision was
dated June 23. The company’s appeal was filed on June 1 after
its original petition for relief was denied in April. The number
of fired employees wasn’t listed on the documents.  
 Buffett cut more than 20,000 jobs last year as the economic
slump curbed demand for the textiles, manufactured houses and
diamond rings sold by Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire. The
company, which employs more than 200,000, resumed hiring in some
businesses as the economy improved, Buffett said in May.  
 “We do hire people when we have something for them to
do,” Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer,
said on May 1. Buffett, 79, didn’t respond to a request for
comment e-mailed to an assistant today.  
 Berkshire cut the jobs at Fort Payne, Alabama-based Desoto
amid a decline in sales, the department said. The employee
reductions weren’t caused by Berkshire’s move to shift sock
production to Honduras in 2006 and 2007, the department said in
its original rejection of the company’s request for aid.  
 The trade adjustment assistance, which began in 1962,
provides workers who have been harmed because their plant moved
overseas or shut due to increased imports with an additional 18
months of unemployment insurance, a tax break to help pay for
health insurance and subsidized training.  
 Desoto is part of Berkshire’s Fruit of the Loom, which had
about 27,000 workers at the end of 2009, compared with almost
35,000 a year earlier. Berkshire added to its clothing business
with the 2006 takeover of athletic wear maker Russell Corp.  
 Berkshire’s profit jumped 61 percent to $8.06 billion in
2009.
