             Time Warner Inc.  sold $3 billion of
debt in a three-part offering as the owner of the Warner Bros.
movie studio and the HBO cable channel tapped the corporate bond
market for the second time this year.  
 The offering was divided evenly among 5-year, 10.5-year and
30-year securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
5-year debt yields 140 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, the 10.5-year notes yield 175 basis points more than
benchmarks, and the 30-year bonds pay a 215 basis-point spread.  
 Demand for bonds from companies such as Time Warner suggest
“the investor base just has a tremendous amount of cash to put
to work,” said  Justin D’Ercole , head of investment-grade
syndicate for the Americas at Barclays Capital, which led the
underwriting of the issue.  
 New York-based Time Warner said in a prospectus filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that proceeds will
be used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.  
 Time Warner’s sale follows a $2 billion issue in March, as
the company extends debt maturities while rewarding shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases. The company raised its
 quarterly payout  to 21.25 cents a share from 18.75 cents in
February, and boosted its share buyback program to $3 billion
from $1 billion.  
 “The company continuously monitors the capital markets and
chooses to access the markets when it determines favorable
conditions exist,” said  Keith Cocozza , a spokesman for Time
Warner.  
 Retiring Debt  
 Time Warner  will use the proceeds to redeem as much as $1
billion of 5.5 percent notes maturing in November 2011, $2
billion of 6.875 percent debt due in May 2012, and $1 billion of
9.125 percent notes dated January 2013, according to the
prospectus and data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “Maintaining a strong balance sheet, particularly in this
environment of an uncertain global economy, is a strategic asset
and is going to allow us to do everything that we choose to do
on a go-forward basis,” Chief Financial Officer  John Martin 
said in a May 27 presentation to investors.  
 Time Warner had $11.2 billion of outstanding public debt
securities as of March 31, according to the prospectus.  
 The offering is Time Warner’s biggest debt sale since
November 2006, when the company issued $5 billion of bonds in a
four-part offering.  
 Previous Sale  
 Time Warner sold $1.4 billion of 4.875 percent, 10-year
notes in March that paid 130 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and $600 million of 6.2 percent, 30-year
bonds at a spread of 162 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  
 Proceeds from the March sale were used to redeem Time
Warner’s $1 billion of 6.75 percent debt maturing in April 2011,
it said in a filing with the SEC.  
 Time Warner’s offering is rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors
Service and the company has an equivalent BBB from Standard &
Poor’s.  
 Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Wells Fargo & Co. managed the sale, Bloomberg data show.  
 The average BBB rated bond maturing in 10 years or more
yields 6.31 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.
