             Hexagon AB , the world’s biggest maker
of measuring instruments, agreed to buy U.S.-based Intergraph
Corp. for $2.13 billion to add software that helps companies
visualize complex data and design factories, ships and oilrigs.  
 The purchase is fully financed through bank facilities,
Stockholm-based Hexagon said in a statement today, adding that
it will seek to raise $850 million from a share sale to existing
investors once the transaction has been completed.  
 Buying Huntsville, Alabama-based Intergraph will boost
Hexagon’s workforce by more than 50 percent, adding 4,000
employees in 34 countries. The deal follows the  purchase  of
Brown & Sharpe, Leica Geosystems and NovAtel in the past decade.  
 “This fits right into Hexagon’s strategy,” said  Jon Hyltner , an analyst at Handelsbanken AB in Stockholm with a
“buy” rating on shares of the Swedish company. “They have
talked for a while about wanting to do something, so it’s not a
huge surprise, but this is a really big acquisition.”  
 Intergraph, which provides software to businesses and
governments in more than 60 countries, seems to have “pretty
good” profitability, Hyltner said.  
 Hexagon was trading little changed at 101.60 kronor as of
9:23 a.m. in Stockholm. It has declined 3.9 percent this year,
valuing the company at 27 billion kronor ($3.5 billion).
