             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell to the lowest level in a week after a
report showed  consumer prices  were unchanged in June from the
previous month.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 11.29 percent at 8:40 a.m. New York time. Earlier it
touched 11.28 percent, the lowest since June 25.  
 “Back in March, people were talking about significant
inflation risks, so this is something that adds into lowering
pressure on  interest rates , in addition to the fact that global
growth concerns are still there,” said  Roberto Melzi , a
currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.  
 The median estimate of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a consumer price increase of 0.11 percent. Annual
inflation was 4.84 percent in June, lower than the median
estimate of 4.96 percent in a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists.  
 The real rose 0.3 percent to 1.7747 per dollar, from 1.7796
yesterday.
