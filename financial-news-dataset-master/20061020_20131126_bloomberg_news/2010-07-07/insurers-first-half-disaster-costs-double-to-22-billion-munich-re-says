             Insurers’ losses from natural
catastrophes, including the February earthquake in Chile,
totaled $22 billion in the first half of the year, more than
double the average for the period since 2000,  Munich Re  said.  
 Insured losses surpassed the first-half record from 2008
and compare with $11 billion reported for the same period last
year, the Munich-based company said in an e-mailed  statement 
today. Total economic losses from natural catastrophes amounted
to $70 billion in the first six months of 2010, the world’s
largest reinsurer said.  
 “Following a relatively benign 2009, the first six months
of this year were marked by three natural catastrophes ranked as
great,” said  Peter Hoeppe , who heads  Munich Re ’s Geo Risks
Research Department. The disasters were earthquakes in Chile and
Haiti and storms in Europe.  
 The Chile earthquake, the world’s  fifth-strongest  in a
century, resulted in insured losses of about $8 billion,
according to Munich Re. European reinsurers such as Munich Re
and  Swiss Reinsurance Co.  have disclosed the highest claims from
the quake.  
 “The Haiti and Chile earthquakes in particular rank among
the most devastating events ever recorded, based on a number of
parameters,” according to today’s statement.  
 European winter storm Xynthia, which swept across Portugal,
Spain, France and Germany in February, is expected to cost
insurers $3.4 billion, Munich Re said.  
 Global Warming  
 The insurance industry, which lost more than 16 percent of
its surplus in the financial collapse through the end of March
2009, has regained the funds as asset values recovered,
Insurance Information Institute President  Bob Hartwig  said in a
conference call hosted by Munich Re. Some of the funds may be
needed for hurricane claims this year, he said.  
 The 2010 Atlantic storm season may be the most active since
2005, which was the worst on record with $115 billion in damage,
Moody’s Investors Service said last month. The season began in
June and ends in November.  
 Losses from natural catastrophes caused by climate change
will rise, Hoeppe said in the call. Eight of the 12 most
expensive disasters in U.S. history have occurred since 2004,
Munich Re said. Weather-related catastrophes have increased at a
faster rate than geophysical events, he said.  
 “Global warming has already and will in the future
contribute to the increase in the probability of these events,”
he said.  
 Catastrophes outside the U.S. this year cost insurers more
than twice as much as domestic disasters, Munich Re data show,
which is “quite atypical,” Hoeppe said. Disasters in the first
half of the year in the U.S. accounted for 28 percent of global
insured losses, compared with a 60 percent average since 1980,
Munich Re said.
