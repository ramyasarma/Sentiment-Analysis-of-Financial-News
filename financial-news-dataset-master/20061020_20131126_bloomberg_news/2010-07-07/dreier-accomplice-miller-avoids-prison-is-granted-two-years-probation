             Robert L. Miller, who once worked as
a lawyer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was
sentenced to two years’ probation for helping New York law firm
founder  Marc Dreier  defraud hedge funds.  
 U.S. District Judge  Kimba Wood  imposed the sentence today
in New York.  
 Miller pleaded guilty to impersonating a representative of
a Canadian pension plan and an Icelandic hedge fund official as
part of Dreier’s scheme to sell a phony $44.7 million note.
Miller said Dreier paid him $100,000.  
 The attorney “began spiraling down into the abyss of
alcoholism and mental illness” before agreeing to help Dreier,
Miller’s lawyers said in court papers. He has cooperated with
prosecutors, his lawyers said.  
 Dreier is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison in
Minnesota. He admitted selling at least $400 million in phony
notes to hedge funds to pay for his lavish lifestyle and prop up
his now-defunct 250-lawyer New York firm, Dreier LLP.  
 Another admitted Dreier accomplice, former broker  Kosta Kovachev , was sentenced to 46 months in prison in March.  
 The case is U.S. v. Miller, 09-01077, and the Dreier 
case is U.S. v. Dreier, 09-00085, U.S. District Court, Southern 
District of New York (Manhattan).
