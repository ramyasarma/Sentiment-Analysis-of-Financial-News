             Gold futures rose in New York,
erasing losses, on speculation that the lowest prices in six
weeks reflected a sell-off that was overdone.  
 Gold touched $1,185 an ounce today, the lowest price since
May 24, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose for the second
straight day. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, have dropped for three
days in a row. Since reaching a record $1,266.50 on June 21,
gold has declined 5.3 percent.  
 “Some will look at the selling as overdone,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “A lot of
technical damage has been done. In the short term, there are
oversold conditions.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $3.80, or 0.3
percent, to $1,198.90 on the Comex in New York, after dropping
as much as 0.8 percent. The metal has gained 9.4 percent this
year.  
 Earlier, gold’s seven-day relative-strength index was below
30 for a second session, a signal to some traders that the price
is poised to rise.  
 The amount of bullion held in the SPDR Gold Trust fell 2.43
metric tons to 1,316.48 tons yesterday, according to the
company’s website. It was the third straight decline, the
longest slump since January.  
 Gold demand in China gained in the first half as government
measures to cool the property market and falling equities
spurred purchases, Song Yuqin, a vice general manager at the
Shanghai Gold Exchange, said today at a conference in Beijing.  
 China’s Holdings  
 China held 1,054.1 metric tons of gold last month, ranking
sixth in the world behind the U.S., Germany, the International
Monetary Fund, Italy and France, according to the  World Gold
Council . The metal makes up about 1.6 percent foreign reserves
in China, which purchased 454 tons from 2003 to 2009, according
to the producer-funded council.  
 The precious metal is unlikely to become a major holding in
China’s foreign reserves because of wide price swings and a lack
of interest payments, China’s State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said in a statement. China will “carefully consider”
whether to raise or reduce the amount of gold it has, the
regulator said.  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 14.3 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $18 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $7.70, or 0.5
percent, to $1,526.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Palladium futures for September delivery rose $1.95,
or 0.4 percent, to $442.35 an ounce.
