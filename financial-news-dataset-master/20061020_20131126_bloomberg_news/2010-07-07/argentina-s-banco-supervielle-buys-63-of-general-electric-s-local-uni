             Argentina’s  Banco Supervielle SA 
bought General Electric Co.’s local unit, the bank said in a
filing to the website of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.  
 The bank bought 63.09 percent of the company’s shares while
the remaining shares were purchased by Grupo Supervielle SA and
Banco Regional de Cuyo SA, a Grupo Supervielle company. The
country’s central bank and anti-trust agency still need to
review the purchase, the statement said, without giving details
on the value of the transaction.  
 Supervielle is Argentina’s 16th-biggest bank, with 3.7
billion pesos ($940 million) in deposits, according to the
country’s central bank.  
 A message left by Bloomberg News with the press office of
Supervielle wasn’t immediately returned.
