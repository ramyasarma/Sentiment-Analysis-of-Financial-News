             Credit-default swaps tied to European
corporate bonds snapped the longest winning streak in more than
two weeks as concern about the strength of the economic recovery
overshadowed yesterday’s successful bond sale by Spain.  
 The cost of insuring against losses on European corporate
bonds rose, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of default
swaps on 50 mostly high-yield companies climbing 6.4 basis
points to 567.3 as of 1:08 p.m. in London, according to Markit
Group Ltd. Contracts on Spanish debt pared yesterday’s decline
and rose 5 basis points to 257, CMA DataVision prices show.  
 Spain, which is struggling to plug the euro region’s third-
largest budget deficit, raised 6 billion euros ($7.6 billion)
from its first issue of bonds through a bank syndicate since
February. The boost this gave European credit markets was
overshadowed by an Institute for Supply Management report that
showed  service industries  in the U.S. expanded more slowly in
June than economists forecast.  
 “The market improvement yesterday might only be temporary
in our view and could easily end up in another short-term bull
trap,”  Markus Ernst , a credit analyst at UniCredit SpA in
Munich, wrote in a note to investors.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on
125 investment-grade companies rose 0.8 basis point to 125,
Markit Group prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of
contracts on 25 European banks and insurers climbed 1.5 basis
points to 151.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 The high-yield corporate swaps index had fallen for the
previous three days, signalling an improvement in perceptions of
credit quality and the longest run of gains since June 21.  
 Greece Swaps  
 Credit-default swaps on Greece’s government bonds rose 11.5
basis points to 903.5, compared with a record-high closing price
of 1,125.8 basis points on June 24, CMA prices show. Contracts
on Portugal added 9.5 basis points to 297, Italy advanced 4
basis points to 181.5 and Ireland rose 8 basis points to 260.  
 The all-time high closing price for default swaps on Spain
is 274.5 basis points reached on May 6, according to CMA. The
southern European nation’s new bonds due October 2020 fell in
the first day of trading, Bloomberg data show.  
 Spain’s 6 billion euros of new securities fell 0.3 cent to
a bid price of 99.51 cents on the euro, pushing the yield
premium to benchmark Germany debt up 6 basis points to 234,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc prices on Bloomberg.  
 The ISM’s index of U.S. non-manufacturing businesses, which
covers about 90 percent of the world’s largest economy, fell to
a four-month low of 53.8 from 55.4 in May. The June figure was
less than the median forecast of 55 in a Bloomberg News survey.
Readings above 50 signal expansion. Orders slowed for a third
month and employment declined.  
 ‘Disappointing’  
 The “disappointing” data from the U.S. “underscore
evidence that the economic recovery seems to be slowing,” said
 Juan Esteban Valencia , a London-based credit strategist at
Societe Generale SA.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company or country fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A
basis point on a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.
