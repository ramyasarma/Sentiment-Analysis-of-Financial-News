             Futures traders will add to bets on
the euro dropping against the dollar after the aggregate number
of wagers declined in June, according to Societe Generale SA.  
 The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain was 73,670 on June 29, compared with record net
shorts of 113,890 on May 11, figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  
 With the euro trading at about $1.25, “shorts should now
be reopened, as the strategy is no longer overcrowded,” Societe
Generale strategists including  Alain Bokobza  in Paris wrote in a
research note today.  
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2601 at 12:20 p.m. in
London, from $1.2626 yesterday, when it touched $1.2662, the
highest level since May 21. It fell to $1.1877 on June 7, the
lowest level since March 2006.  
 Futures are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price
and date. Each Friday, the CFTC publishes aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors that buy or sell futures to protect
against price moves.  
 Analysts and investors follow changes in speculators’
positions because such transactions can reflect an expectation
of a change in prices. A long is a bet a currency will rise,
while a short is a wager on a drop.
