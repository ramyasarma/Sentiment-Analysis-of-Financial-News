             Saudi Arabia shares fell the most in
more than a week as concern economic growth is faltering pushed
global stocks lower and after  Fitaihi Holding Group  and  National
Gypsum Co.  posted lower quarterly earnings.  
 The kingdom’s  Tadawul All Share Index  retreated 1.1
percent, the most since June 29, to 6,056.41, led by  Saudi Basic
Industries Corp.,  the world’s largest petrochemical company. The
benchmark rose 1.6 percent yesterday.  Fitaihi  and  National
Gypsum Co.  slid the most in more than a month. The  Bloomberg GCC
200 Index  of Gulf equities fell 0.5 percent and Dubai’s  DFM
General Index  lost 0.9 percent.  
 The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-

four-month low from May, according to data published yesterday.
Global stocks fell, with the  MSCI World Index  of developed
nations retreating 0.3 percent as of 4:45 p.m. in Dubai.  
 “All eyes are on the U.S.,” said Haissam Arabi, chief
executive officer of Gulfmena Alternative Investments in Dubai.
“We will resume downward trading. Yesterday was a short lived
rally.”  
 Fitaihi retreated 2.8 percent, the most since May 25, to
12.3 riyals. The Saudi Arabian owner of jewelry stores said
second-quarter profit slid more than 50 percent to 2.1 million
riyals ($560,000) from 4.8 million riyals a year earlier.  
 National Gypsum lost the most since June 5, decreasing 2.8
percent to 31.3 riyals. The Saudi Arabian maker of building
materials said second-quarter net income fell 32 percent to 16.4
million riyals. Saudi Basic lost 3.7 percent, the most since
June 29, to 85 riyals.

 Qatar’s  QE Index  increased 0.4 percent.  Qatar National Bank
SAQ,  the company with the biggest weighting on the country’s
index, gained 0.8 percent to 135.5 riyals after posting a 36
percent increase in net income, beating all six analyst
estimates on Bloomberg.  
 The  Kuwait Stock Exchange Index  climbed 1.3 percent, the
