             Chinese dissident Liu Xianbin has
been arrested on charges of subversion 19 months after he was
released from prison for subversion of state power, the South
China Morning Post reported, citing Chen Mingxian, Liu’s wife.  
 Liu was taken into custody on June 28 after police raided
his home and confiscated his computer and some documents,
according to the report. Liu, 41, a founding member of the China
Democracy Party, was sentenced to 13 years in 1999 for
subversion of state power, the Morning Post said. He was
released in November 2008 after his jail term was cut by three
years and eight months for good behaviour, according to the
report.
