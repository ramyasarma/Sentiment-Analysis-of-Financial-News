             Nigeria’s central bank offered the
smallest amount of dollars in three months at a currency auction
today, failing to meet lenders’ demand and placing the naira
under pressure, Source Capital Nigeria Ltd. said.  
 The Central Bank of Nigeria offered $150 million at its
twice-weekly auction, the least since March 29, while banks
sought to by $214 million, according to an e-mail from the
Abuja-based bank. Dollars were sold for between 147.9 naira and
148.6 naira.  
 “If the central bank fails to meet lenders’ demand
consistently for about three weeks, the naira is bound to come
under fresh pressure,” Kweku Brown, an analyst with Source
Capital, a financial advisory company, said by phone from Lagos.  
 The naira weakened for the first day in three, dropping 0.3
percent to 150.17 versus the dollar as of 4:03 p.m. in Lagos.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer depreciated
to 152.35 per dollar on May 18, the weakest level this year,
with demand for dollars exceeding supply at all currency
auctions from April 26 till then. The West African nation’s
central bank increased dollars on offer to ease pressure on the
naira, with the currency appreciating 1 percent since May 18.
