             Copper rose in New York and London on
an increased forecast for world economic growth from the
International Monetary Fund and on a further drop in inventories
of metal.  
 The global economy will expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the
most since 2007 and above an April projection of 4.2 percent,
the IMF said yesterday. Stockpiles of copper tracked by the
London Metal Exchange contracted for a 15th day and the  MSCI
World Index  of shares climbed for a third day.  
 “There is a little bit more optimism out there,”  Marc Elliott , an analyst at Fairfax IS in London, said today by
telephone.  
 Futures for September delivery advanced 1.55 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.0305 a pound at 8:23 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Copper for delivery in three months gained 0.8 percent to
$6,695 a metric ton on the LME.  
 Prices increased as the U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency
gauge of the greenback’s strength, pared a climb of as much as
0.2 percent to trade little changed. A stronger U.S. currency
makes dollar-priced metals more expensive in terms of other
monies. The index has climbed 7.7 percent this year,
contributing to LME copper’s 9.2 percent slide.  
 Chinese Demand  
 Prices also have dropped on concern that Europe’s debt
crisis may crimp usage of metals and demand may wane in China,
the world’s largest copper consumer, as the government moves to
restrain the nation’s surging economy. Financial-market turmoil
has increased the risks to the recovery, according to the IMF.  
 Global growth next year will be 4.3 percent, unchanged from
its April forecast, the IMF said in revisions yesterday to its
World Economic Outlook. The fund urged European Union policy
makers to take further “decisive” steps to combat a sovereign-
debt crisis that it said poses a threat to the world financial
system.  
 Copper prices showed little response immediately after the
European Central Bank kept its benchmark rate at 1 percent
today, as predicted by all 55 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  
 Stockpiles of copper tracked by the LME slid to 439,000
tons, the lowest level since Nov. 30. Bookings to remove metal
from LME warehouses dropped 7.6 percent to 32,425 tons.  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME rose 0.4
percent to $1,994.75 a ton and lead gained 1.9 percent to $1,829
a ton. Nickel advanced 1 percent to $19,335 a ton, zinc climbed
0.8 percent to $1,868 a ton and tin was unchanged at $17,650 a
ton.
