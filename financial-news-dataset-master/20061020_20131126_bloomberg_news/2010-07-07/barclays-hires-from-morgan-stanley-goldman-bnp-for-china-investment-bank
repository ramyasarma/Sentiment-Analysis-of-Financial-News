             Barclays Plc  hired Peter Ding and
 Gary Kuo  from Morgan Stanley to jointly run its Greater China
investment-banking unit, said two people with knowledge of the
appointments.  
 Peter Ding, the former co-head of mergers and acquisitions
for Asia-Pacific outside Japan at  Morgan Stanley , and the Wall
Street firm’s former Taiwan Chairman Gary Kuo will become co-
heads of investment banking for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the
people said, declining to be identified.  
 Ding and Kuo bring the number of senior executives in Asia
leaving Morgan Stanley for London-based Barclays to four in the
past year. Barclays today said it hired  Vanessa Koo  from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and BNP Paribas SA’s James Lim as the U.K. bank
builds its investment-banking business in Asia.  
 Timothy Cuffe , a spokesman at Barclays in Hong Kong,
declined to comment. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Noel Cheung
confirmed the departure of Ding, 43, and said Samuel Kim will
become the firm’s sole head of M&A for Asia-Pacific outside
Japan. She declined to comment further.  
 Kuo left Morgan Stanley last month, company spokesman  Nick Footitt  said in a July 2 interview. Ding joined Morgan Stanley
in early 2008 and Kuo had been with the bank since March 2001.  
 Edward King  resigned as  Morgan Stanley ’s head of M&A for
Asia-Pacific last month to take up the same position at Barclays,
people with knowledge of the move said at the time.  Matthew Ginsburg  joined Barclays in September last year as head of
investment banking in the region, a role he previously held at
Morgan Stanley.
