             As many as 34,442 dairy cows in the
U.S. will be removed from producer herds and sold to
slaughterhouses through an industry program to boost milk prices
by curbing output.  
 The cull, financed by the National Milk Producers
Federation, is the first since three “herd retirements” last
year removed 200,761 cows, the group said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 “This latest herd retirement will push cow numbers lower
still, which is what our industry needs” after the number of
dairy cattle rebounded from a three-year low in December, said
 Jerry Kozak , the president and chief executive officer of the
Arlington, Virginia-based federation.  
 Class III milk futures for August delivery rose 1 cent to
$14.63 per 100 pounds on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The
price has jumped 45 percent in the past year.  
 In the nine previous culls since the summer of 2003, more
than 480,000 dairy cows were slaughtered,  data  from the
federation show. The latest program is the first since last
fall.  
 Milk  production  climbed 1.1 percent in May to 15.741
billion pounds (7.7 billion kilograms) from a year earlier, the
U.S.  Department of Agriculture  said last month. The May dairy
herd totaled 9.103 million head, down 1.8 percent from a year
earlier, while the average cow produced 1,866 pounds of milk, or
3 percent more, the USDA said.  
 The  average price  farmers will get for all milk this year
will be $15.95 per 100 pounds, a 24 percent increase from 2009,
according to the USDA.
