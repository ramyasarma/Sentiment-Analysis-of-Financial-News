             Gold futures fell to a six-week low
as a rally in equities erodes demand for the precious metal as
an alternative investment.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose for the second
straight day after a report showed that retail sales are growing
at the fastest pace in four years. Assets in the SPDR Gold
Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion,
dropped for the third session in a row. Gold has declined 5.7
percent from a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21.  
 “The money that found its way into gold’s coffers is
looking for other places,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle
Futures Group in Chicago. “More people are betting on a higher
stock market. There’s just a lack of buying interest for gold.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery fell 90 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $1,194.20 at 11:39 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $1,185, the lowest level for a most-
active contract since May 24. Before today, the metal gained 9
percent this year.  
 Gold demand in China gained in the first half as government
measures to cool the property market and falling equities
spurred purchases, Song Yuqin, a vice general manager at the
Shanghai Gold Exchange, said today at a conference in Beijing.  
 Gold is unlikely to become a major holding in China’s
foreign reserves because of wide price swings and a lack of
interest payments, China’s State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said in a statement. China will “carefully consider”
whether to raise or reduce the amount of gold it has, the
regulator said.  
 China’s Holdings  
 China is the sixth-largest holder of gold among governments
with 1,054.1 metric tons, according to the producer-funded World
Gold Council. The metal makes up about 1.6 percent of the
country’s foreign reserves. China purchased 454 tons from 2003
to 2009, according to council.  
 Silver futures for September delivery gained 8.3 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $17.94 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery added $1.30, or 0.1
percent, to $1,520 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery were little
changed at $440.25 an ounce, also on the Nymex.
