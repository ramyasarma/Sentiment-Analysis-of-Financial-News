             Argentina has scrapped plans to swap
dollar bonds due in 2012 to extend maturities on the notes,
known as Bodens, El Cronista reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  
 The government will tap central bank reserves to make
payments on the bonds, including a $2.2 billion cash payout next
month, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said. Global market
turbulence has pushed Argentine yields to levels above what the
government is willing to pay on new notes in a restructuring,
the newspaper said.  
 A message left at the Economy Ministry by Bloomberg News
wasn’t immediately returned.
