             A bill making Petroleo Brasileiro SA
the sole operator of all new deepwater oil fields off Brazil’s
coast was delayed until after October in the lower house.  
 The legislation will give Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-
controlled oil producer is known, a minimum 30 percent stake in
all joint ventures set up to bid for licenses to explore blocks
in the so-called pre-salt region. The vote in the lower house
was delayed until after the nation’s presidential election in
October, Candido Vaccarezza, the house leader of the ruling
coalition, told reporters yesterday in Brasilia.  
 Lawmakers also delayed a vote on a proposal to give
Brazilian states and cities that don’t produce oil a bigger
share of crude royalties, Vaccareza said.
