             Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corp. , China’s biggest chipmaker, priced a sale of
1.5 billion shares at 52 Hong Kong cents (7 U.S. cents) each,
according to two people familiar with the offering.  
 Semiconductor Manufacturing’s  stock dropped 3.3 percent to
59 Hong Kong cents yesterday on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  
 Datang Telecom Technology and Industry, Shanghai-based
SMIC’s largest shareholder, intended to buy as much as $100
million of the shares, according to a sale document obtained
earlier by Bloomberg News.  
 The sale was managed by New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc of London.  
 Victoria Liang, a spokeswoman for Semiconductor
Manufacturing, didn’t answer a call made to her Shanghai office
after regular business hours.
