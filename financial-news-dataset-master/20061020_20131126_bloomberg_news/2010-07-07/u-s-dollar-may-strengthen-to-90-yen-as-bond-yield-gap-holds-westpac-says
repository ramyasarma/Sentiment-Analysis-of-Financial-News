             The dollar is likely to rise against
the yen after Treasuries held onto the yield advantage they
enjoy over Japanese government bonds, Westpac Banking Corp. said
today in a note to clients.  
 The U.S. two-year yield has remained at more than 50 basis
points above the similar rate in Japan, Westpac said. Investors
should consider buying the dollar on expectations it will
strengthen to 90 yen and exit the trade if the greenback drops
close to 86 yen, the bank said.  
 The dollar was at 87.40 yen as of 1:20 p.m. in Tokyo.
