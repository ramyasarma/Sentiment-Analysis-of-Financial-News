             Mexico’s peso bonds rose for a fourth
day, pushing yields to a record low, before a report tomorrow
forecast to show that inflation fell within the central bank’s
target range for a second month this year.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.07 percent at
10:34 a.m. New York time, according to Banco Santander SA, the
lowest yield since the security was issued in 2005. The price
gained 0.46 centavo to 126.43 centavos per peso.  
 “If we continue to see falling inflation figures and
indicators of a slowing global recovery, the yield may fall to
6.5 percent by December,” said  Alonso Madero , who helps manage
66 billion pesos ($5.1 billion) in assets at Actinver SA in
Mexico City.  
 Consumer prices rose 3.74 percent in June from a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. It would be the second time this year
inflation fell within the central bank’s target range of 2
percent to 4 percent.  
 The yields may fall to 7 percent or lower “within days,”
Madero said. So far this year, yields have dropped 120 basis
points.  
 The currency gained 0.4 percent to 12.9171 per dollar, from
12.9675 yesterday. The peso has gained 1.3 percent against the
U.S. dollar this year, the third-best performer among the 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen and
Singapore’s dollar.
