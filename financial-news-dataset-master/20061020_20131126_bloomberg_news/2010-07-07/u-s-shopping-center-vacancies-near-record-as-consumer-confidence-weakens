             Vacancies at U.S. neighborhood and
community shopping centers moved closer to the highest on record
in the second quarter amid signs the economic recovery is losing
steam and consumer confidence remains subdued,  Reis Inc.  said.  
 The vacancy rate at shopping centers rose to 10.9 percent
from 10 percent a year earlier and 10.8 percent in the first
quarter, the New York-based real estate research firm said in a
report today. It was the highest since 1991’s 11 percent. The
record for  shopping  center vacancies since Reis began tracking
the data 30 years ago was 11.1 percent in 1990.  
 “There are really very few reasons to believe that
performance deterioration won’t continue for another 18 to 24
months for retail properties, although there are some signs that
the pace of decline is moderating,”  Victor Calanog , director of
research, said in the report.  
 Out of 80 cities, 11 posted increases in rents paid by
tenants. “Compared to the last two quarters, when most if not
all of our markets posted declines in effective rents, this is
good news,” Calanog said.  
 Private employers added 83,000 workers last month, less
than the 110,000 forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey, the Labor Department reported July 2. That heightened
concern that Americans will curtail spending and weaken an
economic recovery. Confidence among U.S. consumers sank by more
than estimated as they became distressed over the jobs outlook,
figures from the Conference Board showed last month.  
 The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Retailing  Index  has
fallen 23 percent since April 26, when it touched the highest
level since July 2007.  
 Little New Space  
 “Less than 400,000 square feet of new strip mall space was
added in the second quarter, so increases in the national
vacancy rate are coming from existing properties bleeding out,
not from new properties,” Calanog said.  
 Effective rents at the shopping centers, or what tenants
actually pay rather than landlords’ asking rents, fell 2.8
percent from a year earlier and 0.5 percent from the previous
quarter, Reis said.  
 At regional and super-regional malls, vacancies remained at
a 10-year high, rising to 9 percent from 8.4 percent a year
earlier and 8.9 percent in the first quarter. Asking rents fell
for the seventh straight quarter, the longest streak in the 10
years Reis has compiled the numbers.  
 Regional malls typically include department stores and
fashion and general merchandise retailers and range in size from
400,000 to 800,000 square feet (37,161 to 74,322 square meters),
according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Super-regional malls, including the  Mall of America  in
Minnesota, South Coast Plaza in Southern California and Tysons
Corner Center in Virginia, are defined as those larger than
800,000 square feet.  
 Neighborhood shopping centers tend to be 30,000 to 150,000
square feet and mainly house convenience retailers. Community
 shopping centers  are 100,000 to 350,000 square feet and may
include a discount department, home-improvement or grocery
store.
