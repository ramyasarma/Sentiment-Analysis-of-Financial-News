 The following are among the most active stocks in the

 Dutch stocks:  
 ArcelorMittal  (MT NA), the world’s biggest steelmaker,
declined 1.9 percent to 22.15 euros, paring yesterday’s 5.8
percent gain. Basic resources stocks declined as copper, lead
and tin prices dropped on the London Metal Exchange.  
 InnoConcepts NV  (INNOC NA) surged 19 percent to 22 euro

company that works with investors to develop new products agreed

guaranteed by InnoConcepts. The agreement “draws a line under a
major legacy issue,” InnoConcepts said. The company will take
an impairment charge of up to 20 million euros ($25 million)
related to the settlement, it said.  
 TomTom NV  (TOM2 NA) soared 8.2 percent to 4.81 euros, the
biggest gain in two months. Europe’s biggest maker of portable
navigation devices was raised to “neutral” from
“underperform” at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.  
 Belgian stocks:  
 Nyrstar NV  (NYR BB), the world’s biggest zinc producer,
fell 2.2 percent to 8.42 euros, paring yesterday’s 7.6 percent
surge. Zinc for delivery in three months fell, ending three days
of gains.  
 Separately, Nyrstar acquired the remaining 15 percent in
the Coricancha mine in Peru from Gold Hawk Resources Inc. for
about $4.4 million.
