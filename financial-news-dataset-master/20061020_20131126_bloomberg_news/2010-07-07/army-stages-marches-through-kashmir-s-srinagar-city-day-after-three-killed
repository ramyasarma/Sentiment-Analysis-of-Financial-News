             India’s army paraded in the summer
capital of Kashmir, Srinagar, today in a bid to stem violent
protests after three people died yesterday in alleged police
firing, Press Trust of India reported.  
 “Flag marches” were carried out in the heart of the city
and near the airport, PTI said, citing an official it didn’t
name. Authorities have clamped curfews on Srinagar and other
towns in the Himalayan region as protests over the deaths of
more than a dozen anti-India demonstrators in the past month
spread, the agency said.
