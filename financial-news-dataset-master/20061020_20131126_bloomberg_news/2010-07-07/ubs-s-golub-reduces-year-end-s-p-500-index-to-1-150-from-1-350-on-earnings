             UBS AG reduced its forecast for where
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will end the year to 1,150,
citing slower profit growth and an unwillingness among investors
to pay higher valuations for earnings.  
 Jonathan Golub , the chief U.S. market strategist at UBS,
cut his forecast from 1,350, according to a report sent to
clients today. The average projection among 13 strategists
surveyed by Bloomberg News is 1,259. He also reduced his
forecast for total 2010 and 2011 earnings at S&P 500 companies
to $84 and $91 a share, respectively, from $87 and $97.  
 The shift at UBS follows the 16 percent  retreat  in the S&P
500 since its 19-month high in April amid concern that spending
cuts at indebted European nations will curb global economic
growth. Golub, whose projection for the stock index requires a
12 percent rally to prove accurate, cited “modestly weaker
earnings growth” and “lower multiples due to an increased
focus on longer-term secular headwinds” in his report.  
 “The U.S. economic and earnings recovery remains intact,
and the chances of a double-dip recession and a corporate
earnings contraction are low,” New York-based Golub wrote.
“However, incoming economic data have been showing signs of
decelerating growth, producing a string of recent
disappointments.”  
 The S&P 500 retreated 5 percent last week after the
Conference Board slashed its estimate of Chinese growth and U.S.
government reports on employment and manufacturing trailed the
median economist estimates.

                          July 8 (Bloomberg) -- Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC, talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li about the outlook for U.S. stocks.
     Bianco, speaking from Chicago, also discusses his investment strategy, stress tests for European banks, and the U.S. housing market. European Union regulators are carrying out stress tests on 91 banks, accounting for 65 percent of the area’s banking industry, to examine whether they can withstand a shrinking economy and a drop in government bond values.
