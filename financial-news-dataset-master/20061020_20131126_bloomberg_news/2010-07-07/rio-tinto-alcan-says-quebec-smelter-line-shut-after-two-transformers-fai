             An aluminum production line at  Rio
Tinto Plc ’s Laterriere Works smelter in Quebec may be closed for
as long as six months after two electrical transformers failed.  
 Workers may be laid off because of yesterday’s failure,
Quebec’s RDI television news network reported today, citing Rio
officials at a press conference in Saguenay, Quebec.  
 The smelter is currently operating at half of its total
capacity of 235,000 metric tons, the London-based company said
in a statement. The cause of the incident and its impact on the
plant are under investigation, Rio said.  
 The London-based company is the world’s second-largest
aluminum producer after Russia’s United Co. Rusal.
