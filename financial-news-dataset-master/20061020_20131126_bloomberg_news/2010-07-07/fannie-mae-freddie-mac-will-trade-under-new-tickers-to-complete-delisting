             Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the
mortgage companies 80 percent owned by U.S. taxpayers, will
begin trading under new ticker symbols tomorrow as they complete
their delisting from major U.S. exchanges.  
 Fannie Mae’s common and preferred stock will trade on the
 OTC Bulletin Board  under FNMA, the Washington-based company said
today in a news release. In a separate statement, McLean,
Virginia-based Freddie Mac said it will trade as FMCC on the
bulletin board and the Pink Sheet Electronic Quotation Service.
Fannie Mae formerly traded as FNM, Freddie Mac as FRE.  
 The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the regulator that has
overseen the companies since 2008, ordered them to delist last
month after the  New York Stock Exchange  told Fannie Mae that its
shares no longer met listing standards. The NYSE and the Chicago
Stock Exchange will suspend trading of their shares before
markets open tomorrow.  
 The government-sponsored firms, which own or guarantee more
than half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market, had been at
risk of delisting since September 2008, when their share prices
collapsed and they were placed under federal conservatorship.  
 Companies are subject to delisting by the NYSE when their
share prices fall below $1 for 30 consecutive trading days.
