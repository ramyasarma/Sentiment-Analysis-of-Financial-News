             Calpine Corp. , the largest U.S.
producer of power from natural gas, will be the biggest
beneficiary of air-pollution rules proposed by the Obama
administration, Pritchard Capital Partners LLC said.  
 The tougher-than-expected reductions of sulfur dioxide
proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency yesterday will
push power generation to switch to gas from coal, and Houston-
based Calpine has the most efficient fleet,  Charles Fishman , a
Pritchard analyst, wrote in a report today.  
 RRI Energy Inc. , a Houston-based power producer that plans
to merge with its peer Mirant Corp., will suffer the most
because the company will have to either invest in its coal-fired
generators or shut them, according to Fishman.  
 The regulations would cut sulfur dioxide by 71 percent by
2014 from 2005 levels and nitrogen oxide by 52 percent over the
same period, according to the EPA. Emissions from power plants
have been linked to illnesses such as asthma and heart attacks,
according to the EPA.  
 Calpine gained 22 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $13.12 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading as of 4:02 p.m. RRI rose
18 cents to $3.97.  
 Laurie Fickman, an RRI spokeswoman, and  Norma Dunn , a
spokeswoman for Calpine, couldn’t be reached for an immediate
comment.
