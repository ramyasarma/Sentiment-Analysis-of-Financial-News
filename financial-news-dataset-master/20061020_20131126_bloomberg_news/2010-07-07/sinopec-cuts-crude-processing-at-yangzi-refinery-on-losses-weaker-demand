             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , the
nation’s largest oil refiner, cut crude processing volume at its
 Yangzi  oil refinery in the eastern Jiangsu province on refining
losses and weaker demand, a plant official said.  
 The plant will process about 600,000 tons of crude this
month, or about 141,000 barrels a day, which is below June’s
output, said the official, who declined to be named because of
company rules. He didn’t give June volume.  
 The plant’s refining business is losing money and the
demand for gasoline, diesel and chemical products is weak, he
said. The plant has a designed capacity of 8 million tons a year.
China Petroleum & Chemical is known as Sinopec.
