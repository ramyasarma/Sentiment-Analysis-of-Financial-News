             South African bonds rose, pushing
yields to a two-month low, after the central bank governor said
the country’s economic recovery was “hesitant,” boosting
speculation interest rates may be reduced to boost growth.  
 The benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rose
20 cents to 123.76 rand, reducing the yield on the security by 5
basis points to 7.82 percent as of 5:52 p.m. in Johannesburg,
the lowest level since April 29.  
 Europe’s economic slowdown will affect South Africa’s
growth, which is “hesitant” and “uneven,” Governor  Gill Marcus  said in speech in Johannesburg today. Withdrawal of
government stimulus packages worldwide may undermine the global
recovery and low interest rates may offset the impact, she said.  
 “They’re not that convinced that the recovery is a robust
one,” said  Vivienne Taberer , a portfolio manager who helps
manage about $70 billion at  Investec Asset Management  in Cape
Town. “That increases speculation of another rate cut.”  
 Slowing inflation has given the  Reserve Bank  scope to
reduce its key rate seven times since December 2008 to foster a
recovery after the economy fell into its first recession in 17
years in 2009. Policy makers unexpectedly cut the rate by 50
basis points on March 25 to 6.5 percent, the lowest since the
repurchase rate was introduced in 1999.  
 Inflation  eased to a four-year low of 4.6 percent in May
helped by the rand’s 23 percent rally against the dollar since
the start of last year and an improved corn crop that made the
staple food more affordable. The central bank targets an
inflation rate between 3 and 6 percent.  
 ‘Most Dovish Yet’  
 Marcus’s speech “significantly increases the risk of
further monetary easing by the South African Reserve Bank at the
July Monetary Policy Committee meeting,” Rhazia Khan, head of
Africa research at Standard Chartered Plc in London, wrote in a
client note today. “The comments are her most dovish yet.”  
 The central bank is scheduled to make its next interest
rate decision on July 22.  
 The rand strengthened 0.2 percent against the dollar to
7.6349, from a close of 7.6463 yesterday. Against the euro, the
rand appreciated 0.6 percent to 9.6060.  
 Investec’s “base case” scenario is for South Africa’s
benchmark rate to remain unchanged until the third quarter of
next year, when the central bank is likely to begin tightening
monetary policy, said Taberer.  
 Three-month forward-rate agreements , or FRAs, were more
than 27 basis points below the three-month benchmark
 Johannesburg interbank agreed rate  today, the  widest  gap since
March 25. The cost of the three-month contracts for cash in
three months fell 0.5 basis point to 6.335 percent, while the
three-month Jibar rate was 6.60 percent.  
 ‘Flirting’  
 “The FRA market is showing that in the next year any move
in rates is likely to be down,” said Taberer. “The market is
still flirting with the chance of another rate cut.”  
 South Africa’s  gross  gold and foreign currency reserves
increased 1.4 percent to $42.2 billion in June from $41.6
billion in May, the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank said on its
website today. Net reserves rose to $38.2 billion from $37.9
billion.
