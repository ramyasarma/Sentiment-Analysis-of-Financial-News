             Carbon allowances in the  European
Union ’s emissions trading system dropped to the lowest level in
more than six weeks as German power prices declined and
commodities fell.  
 EU permits for December 2010 declined as much as 2.4
percent to 14.82 euros ($18.65) a metric ton, the lowest level
since May 24. They were at 14.84 euros as of 2 p.m. on London’s
European Climate Exchange, paring this year’s gain to 19
percent. The EU cap-and-trade system is the world’s largest.  
 German baseload power for next year, the European
benchmark, fell 1.8 percent to 51.20 euros a megawatt-hour,
according to broker prices on Bloomberg. Lower power prices can
reduce the incentive to sell electricity forward, curbing demand
for emission permits.
