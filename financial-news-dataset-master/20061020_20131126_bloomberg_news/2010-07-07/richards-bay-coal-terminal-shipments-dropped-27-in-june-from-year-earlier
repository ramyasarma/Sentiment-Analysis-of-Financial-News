             Coal shipments from Richards Bay Coal
Terminal, Africa’s biggest export facility for the fuel, fell 27
percent in June as a strike over pay at state-run transportation
company Transnet Ltd. disrupted rail and port operations.  
 Shipments at the South African port fell to 4.02 million
metric tons, from 5.52 million tons last year, RBCT said on its
 website  today.  
 The strike “looks like it’s now affecting the figures,”
 Xavier Prevost , a coal market analyst at Johannesburg-based XMP
Consulting, said by phone today. “It’s disappointing because
everyone wants to export more.”  
 RBCT said May 26 it was running short of coal for shipment
abroad because of the strike, which began May 10 and ended May
28. While the terminal is owned by coal producers including  BHP
Billiton Ltd.  and Anglo American Plc, the trains supplying it
are managed by Transnet.  
 Year-to-date, 27.96 million tons of coal have been shipped
from the terminal, compared with the 91 million tons of annual
capacity after an expansion completed this year. Shipments
totaled 61.14 million tons last year.  
 During the month, 45 vessels were loaded, compared with 73
a year earlier. Stockpiles fell to 2.96 million tons at the end
of June from 4.05 million tons a year ago. The terminal received
638 trains and 5.16 million tons of coal in the month, compared
with 680 trains and 5.25 million tons a year ago.  
 Coal shipped through the port rose to an average $92.71 a
ton during June from $90.78 a ton in May, according to data by
Petersfield, England-based IHS McCloskey on Bloomberg.  
 Transnet spokesman  Sandile Simelane  couldn’t immediately
comment when Bloomberg News reached him on his mobile phone
today. RBCT Chief Executive Officer  Raymond Chirwa  also declined
to comment on the reason for the drop in shipments.
