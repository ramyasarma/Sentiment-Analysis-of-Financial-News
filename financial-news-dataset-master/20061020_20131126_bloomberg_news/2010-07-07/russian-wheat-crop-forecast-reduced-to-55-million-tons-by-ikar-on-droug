             Russia’s wheat crop will be 3.5
percent lower than previously forecast at 55 million metric tons
because of heat and drought, according to the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies, or IKAR.  
 That compares with a forecast of 57 million tons given on
June 28, IKAR’s director, Dmitry Rylko, said in an e-mail today.
Russia harvested 61.8 million tons of wheat in 2009.  
 The Russian grain crop is now estimated at between 85
million and 86 million tons, down from a previous forecast of
87.5 million tons, while the barley harvest will be 19 percent
below last year’s 14.5 million tons, he said.  
 Russia’s Ministry of Agriculture cut its grain forecast by
5.6 percent to 85 million tons on July 5 because of the nation’s
worst drought in a decade. Russia harvested 97 million tons of
grain last year.
