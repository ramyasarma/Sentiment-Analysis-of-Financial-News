             Walt Disney Co.  Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Iger  said he sees “limited exclusivity” for
films and TV shows on mobile devices.  
 Iger spoke to reporters today outside the Allen & Co. media
conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where moguls such as News Corp.
Chairman and CEO  Rupert Murdoch  and  Google Inc.  CEO  Eric Schmidt 
have gathered.  
 “We’re looking for mass distribution under the most
effective circumstances, which means reaching people in easy-to-
use environments where we can create value and monetize,” Iger
said.  
 Disney, owner of the ABC and ESPN TV networks, is seeking
new places to sell media with the emergence of more Internet-
enabled mobile devices. The Burbank, California-based company
created applications this year for  Apple Inc. ’s iPad to display
its prime-time TV shows and films. Disney was the first to sell
shows on Apple’s iTunes online store.  
 Iger also said he’d like to see the U.S. improve its
ability to sell overseas because Disney is an exporter of
intellectual property, such as movies and TV shows, and is
building a theme park in Shanghai.  
 “We’d love to see a world where the U.S. strengthens its
ability to export,” Iger said. The Disney chief was named by
President  Barack Obama  today to serve on a federal advisory
panel that promotes exports.  
 Disney rose $1.42 to $33.14 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 2.8 percent
this year.  
 Iger shrugged off questions on whether he plans to sell the
ABC broadcast network.  
 “I’m not here to make any deals,” he said.
