             A total of 91 banks in the European
Union will be subject to stress tests, the Committee of European
Banking Supervisors said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 The adverse scenario being tested will assume a 3
percentage point deviation from the European Commission’s
economic forecasts and a deterioration of sovereign risk as
compared to market prices in early May, according to the
statement.
