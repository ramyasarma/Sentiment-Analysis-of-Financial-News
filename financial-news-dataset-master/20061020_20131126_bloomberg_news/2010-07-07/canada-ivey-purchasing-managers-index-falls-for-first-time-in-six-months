             Canadian business and government
spending slowed for the first time in six months in June, the
 Ivey  purchasing managers’ index showed.  
 The index fell to 58.9 last month from 62.7 in May, with
readings more than 50 indicating an increase in purchases,
according to the survey of 175 purchasing managers by the
Richard Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario. Economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg predicted a reading of 63.5, according to
the median of 16 responses.  
 “It’s an indication of the weakening growth momentum in
Canada,” said  Millan Mulraine , an economist at TD Securities in
Toronto. Adjusting for seasonal variations, the index fell to
50.7 from 59.1, the most since May 2009, he said.  
 Other reports have shown the economy is slowing after
expanding at the fastest pace in a decade in the first three
months of the year. Building permits fell 10.8 percent in May,
the most since February 2009, Statistics Canada said yesterday,
and the agency reported last week that  gross domestic product 
stalled in April.  
 The economy expanded at a 3.8 percent annual pace in the
second quarter after a 6.1 percent jump in the first, the Bank
of Canada predicts.  
 The Ivey employment gauge fell to 53.6 in June from 58.1 in
May, the index’s first decline in four months. The reading above
50 indicated that hiring still rose. The price index fell to
58.3 from 59.2, showing that prices increased at a slower pace.  
 Inventories rose in June and deliveries took longer to
arrive, the report showed. The inventory index fell to 53.9 from
May’s 54.4, showing that stockpiles increased at a slower rate.
The supplier-deliveries measure fell to 43.5 in June from 44.2
in May, with readings less than 50 signaling that orders took
more time to fill. The  delivery measure  hasn’t exceeded 50 since
June 2009.
