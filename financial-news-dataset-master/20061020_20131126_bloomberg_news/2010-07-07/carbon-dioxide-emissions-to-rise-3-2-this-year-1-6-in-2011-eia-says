             U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from
energy use will climb 3.2 percent this year on economic growth
and higher use of fossil fuels to generate electricity, the
Energy Information Administration forecast today.  
 Carbon dioxide produced from burning coal, oil and natural
gas should rise 1.6 percent in 2011 from 2010 levels, the EIA
said in its July  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  
 Carbon dioxide emissions are likely to increase this year
due to “forecast economic growth combined with increased use of
coal and natural gas in the electric power sector,” according
to the EIA. Emissions in 2011 will likely climb because of
higher coal use in the electricity industry and greater demand
for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in the transportation sector.  
 Last month, the EIA predicted a 2.9 percent increase in
carbon dioxide emissions for this year and a 1.4 percent rise in
2011.
