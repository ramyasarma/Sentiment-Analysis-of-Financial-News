             The 10-year Treasury yield is fair
value at 3.1 percent and “only a very grim macro backdrop” can
justify yields at 2.5 percent or below,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
said.  
 “We continue to stand by our long-held forecast of 3.25
percent for 3-to-6 months,” the company said in an e-mailed
note today.  
 The 10-year yield was little changed at 2.93 percent as of
7:04 a.m. in New York.
