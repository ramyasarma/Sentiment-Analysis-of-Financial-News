             Copper prices gained for a third
straight session in New York as equities rallied and falling
inventories signaled steady demand.  
 The  MSCI World  Index of shares gained for a second day,
indicating an improving outlook for the global economy.
Stockpiles tracked by the  London  Metal Exchange dropped for a
14th session to the lowest level since Nov. 30. Copper has
fallen 9.9 percent this year on concern that slowing growth
would cut demand for the metal used in pipes and wires.  
 “Warehouse supplies are hitting low levels and there’s a
decent gain in the stock market,” said  Donald Selkin , the chief
market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New York.
“These are both providing support as people think that the
recent declines may have been overdone and things are going to
be OK in the economy.”  
 Futures for September delivery rose 4.4 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.015 a pound on the Comex in  New York . The metal
added 3.3 percent in the previous two sessions.  
 Prices also rose as a weaker dollar boosted demand from
traders who buy commodities as alternative assets. The U.S.
Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the greenback’s strength,
fell as much as 0.4 percent.  
 “With little economic data to go on yet again, base metals
are still looking” to the equity and foreign-exchange markets
for direction,  Leon Westgate , a Standard Bank Plc analyst in
London, said in a report. “Falling LME stocks over the balance
of 2010 would be an unusual event, given recent history, and
something we would regard as very bullish for prices,
particularly in early 2011.”  
 LME copper inventories dropped to 439,350 metric tons and
are down 13 percent in 2010. The last time stockpiles had an
annual decline was in 2004.  
 Copper for delivery in three months rose $82.75, or 1.3
percent, to $6,687.75 a metric ton ($3.03 a pound) on the LME.  
 Aluminum, nickel, lead, tin and zinc prices also gained.
