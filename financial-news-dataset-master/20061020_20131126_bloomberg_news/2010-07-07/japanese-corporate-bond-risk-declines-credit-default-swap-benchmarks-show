             The cost of protecting Japanese
corporate bonds from non-payment decreased, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 2 basis points to 133
basis points as of 9:23 a.m. in Tokyo, the lowest level since
July 5, Morgan Stanley and CMA Datavision prices show.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 2 basis points to 138 basis points
as of 8:14 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Credit Agricole CIB.
That’s the highest since July 2, according to CMA. The Markit
iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 133 basis points as
of 10:00 a.m. in Sydney.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
