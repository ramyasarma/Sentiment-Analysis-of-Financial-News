             U.K. 10-year government bond yields
were near the lowest in more than a year as data signaling that
the economic recovery may be losing steam fueled speculation the
central bank will keep interest rates at a record low.  
 Yields on two- and 10-year gilts had declined earlier as an
index of hiring for permanent jobs fell in June to a five-month
low, KPMG LLP and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation
said. U.K. shop prices increased in June at the slowest annual
pace in three months, the British Retail Consortium said. The
FTSE 100 Index lost as much as 1.5 percent earlier before
recovering.  
 “Cautious consumers will not be doing anything for growth
and that’s another reason to keep gilt yields low,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd. in
London. “There’s also more general risk aversion and we’re
getting more of a safe-haven bid into gilts.”  
 The 10-year  gilt yield  gained one basis point to 3.36
percent as of 4:24 p.m. in London, after slipping earlier to
3.32 percent. The 4.75 percent security due March 2020 fell
0.09, or 90 pence per 1,000-pound ($1,521) face amount, to
111.42. The two-year note  yield  was at 0.77 percent. The 10-year
yield fell to 3.31 percent on July 1, the least since April 22,
2009.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of the two-year notes was at 259 basis points. The
 spread  has narrowed from 311 basis points in February, signaling
investor appetite for longer-dated securities which are more
sensitive to the outlook for inflation.  
 Investors pushed their expectations for inflation to the
lowest in almost five months. The 10-year breakeven  rate  was as
low as 279 basis points today, the least since Feb. 15. The
rate, which measures the yield difference between regular and
index-linked bonds and anticipates consumer-price growth during
the next decade, was as high as 325 basis points on April 21.  
 Pound Declines  
 The pound climbed 0.3 percent to $1.5201 and was 0.3
stronger against the euro at 83.08 pence. Britain’s currency has
declined 0.2 percent this year, Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes show.  
 The Bank of England will keep the  benchmark interest rate 
at 0.5 percent when it announces its decision tomorrow,
according to all 60 economists polled by Bloomberg. A separate
poll predicted that the bank would hold its asset-purchase plan
at 200 billion pounds.  
 A gauge of full-time job placements dropped to 60.7 from
61.3 in May, KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment
Confederation said in an e-mailed report today. That’s the
lowest reading since January. Prices of goods in U.K. stores
rose 1.5 percent last month from a year earlier, compared with a
1.8 percent gain in May, BRC said.  
 Gilts returned 6.4 percent this year, compared with a 6.9
percent increase for German bonds, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.
