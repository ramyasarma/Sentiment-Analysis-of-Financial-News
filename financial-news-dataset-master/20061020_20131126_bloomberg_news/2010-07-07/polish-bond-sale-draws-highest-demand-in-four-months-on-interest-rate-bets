             Poland’s two-year bond sale attracted
the highest demand in almost four months on speculation the
central bank will delay interest-rate increases.  
 The government sold 5.96 billion zloty ($1.82 billion) of
the zero-coupon security due in October 2012, according to the
Finance Ministry’s Bloomberg page. Bids totaled 11.1 billion
zloty, compared with 3 billion to 5 billion zloty offered by the
ministry and the highest demand since a March 10 offering of the
bond. The sale included 990 million zloty in an extra offering.  
 Bonds gained and yields on the note have declined 14 basis
points since June 30, when the central bank kept rates on hold
at a record low for the 12th month. Policy makers aren’t “very
worried” by projections inflation may advance to 2.9 percent in
2012 from 2.2 percent in May, the bank’s governor, Marek Belka,
said last week.  
 The projections “showed a benign picture and supported our
view of no rate hikes this year,” said  Grzegorz Ogonek , an
economist at ING Groep NV unit in Warsaw. The auction results
may have been influenced by central bank statements “chilling
rate hike expectations.”  
 With volatility in the global markets and low inflationary
pressure, Poland’s central bank shouldn’t rush ahead to change
interest rates, policy makers  Elzbieta Chojna-Duch  and  Andrzej Kazmierczak  told PAP news agency earlier this week. Adam
Glapinski, another member of the policy-making council, said
lack of fiscal reforms and a weak zloty may pose a threat to
inflation.  
 The Warsaw-based Central Statistical Office is due to
report June inflation data on July 13.  
 The average yield at today’s auction rose to 4.74 percent
from 4.675 on June 2, according to the ministry. The two-year
bonds rose, sending the yield down to 4.739 percent in the
secondary market as of 4:56 p.m. in Warsaw from a close of 4.776
percent yesterday.
