             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock-index futures
fell after China, the nation’s biggest trading partner, signaled
it remains focused on reining in liquidity and stemming
inflation even as growth slows.  
 Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market
value, may be active after Bank of America Corp. recommended
buying the stock. Multiplan Empreendimentos Imobiliarios SA may
be active after O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported the
real-estate developer plans to invest nearly 1.3 billion reais
($730 million) by 2012.  
 Bovespa futures fell 0.2 percent to 62,500 at 8:30 a.m. New
York time. The real was little changed at 1.7802 per dollar.  
 The People’s Bank of China signaled it may continue
monetary tightening even after evidence of slowing growth in the
world’s third-biggest economy contributed to a global stock
sell-off.  
 The Bovespa surged yesterday by the most in three weeks as
metals prices rose, spurring an advance for commodity producers,
and Banco BTG Pactual SA recommended buying banks, homebuilders
and food producers.  
 The Bovespa index  trades  for 11.7 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 10.7 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index  of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.1
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.5 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
