             Wells Fargo & Co. , the fourth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, said it will eliminate 3,800 jobs, or about
1.4 percent of its total workforce, and close its consumer-
finance unit.  
 The lender will take a charge of $185 million, with $137
million, or 2 cents a share, in the second quarter, the San
Francisco-based company said today in a statement. Wells Fargo
will close 638 independent consumer-finance branches and stop
making non-prime home loans, the statement said.  
 “The economics of a separate Wells Fargo Financial channel
are no longer viable, especially now that our customers have
access to the largest banking and mortgage store network in the
United States,”  David Kvamme , president of the unit, said in
the statement.  
 Wells Fargo, which purchased Wachovia Corp. for $12.7
billion in 2008, is the top mortgage lender in the U.S. Auto,
home and credit-card loans will continue to be made from retail
branches, according to the statement. Less than 2 percent of the
bank’s real estate loans were originated in the Wells Fargo
Financial network.  
 “You will probably make more in efficiencies than you will
give up in restructuring charges,”  Christopher Mutascio , an
analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said in a telephone
interview. “It’s been a value-added franchise but it makes
perfect sense when it comes to the branch rationalization.”  
 Wells Fargo operates 6,600 retail branches and 2,200
mortgage offices, the most of any U.S. bank, the statement said.
Wells Fargo Financial is the division that sold consumer loans
and mortgages, including subprime at one time and home-equity
loans, to borrowers with blemished credit.  
 Bank Settles Claim  
 Wells Fargo paid $6.8 million in April 2007 to settle a
claim that accused the unit of obscuring fees and penalties on
subprime mortgages between 1999 and 2005.  
 Wells Fargo Financial employed about 14,000 workers and
most will be reassigned to other areas of the bank, the
statement said. Wells Fargo had 267,400 employees at the end of
the first quarter.  
 Wells Fargo  rose $1.51, or 6 percent, to $26.66 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading today. It has fallen 1.2
percent this year.
