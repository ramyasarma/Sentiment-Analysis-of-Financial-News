             The  Treasury  may lower the amount of
3-, 10- and 30-year securities it is selling for the second
consecutive month, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 10 of
the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers.  
 The government will auction $69 billion of the maturities
next week, according to the median forecast in the survey,
compared with $70 billion last month and a record-tying $81
billion in February. The Treasury will announce the amounts
tomorrow at 11 a.m. New York time.  
 “The reduced sizes make it easier for the market to absorb
Treasury issuance,” said  Ward McCarthy , chief financial
economist in New York at primary dealer Jefferies & Co. Inc.
“In this environment dominated by safe-haven bids, I don’t
foresee the Treasury having difficulty finding bidders for these
auctions. The Treasury will continue to reduce sizes for another
month or two to get the auctions consistent with financing
needs.”  
 The sales will be on three consecutive days beginning July
12. The U.S. will auction $35 billion in 3-year notes, $21
billion in 10-year debt and $13 billion in 30-year bonds,
according to the survey of primary dealers, which are required
to participate in Treasury sales.  
 A $35 billion three-year auction would mark the lowest
amount of the debt sold since July 2009 and the third
consecutive reduction in the sale size. The U.S. auctioned a
record level of $40 billion of the maturity for six consecutive
months ended in April.  
 Scaling Back Borrowing  
 The Treasury is scaling back borrowing after expanding debt
sales to finance annual budget deficits exceeding $1 trillion.
Bond dealers expect the 2010 shortfall to be smaller than the
official $1.6 trillion White House forecast, and the Treasury
indicated that tax revenue is increasing as the economy recovers
from a recession.  
 Officials at the department announced on Nov. 4 a long-term
target of six to seven years for the average maturity of
Treasury debt and said the department was planning to cut back
on its issuance of bills and two- and three-year notes.  
 The Treasury sold $36 billion of three-year notes at the
last offering, on June 8. It auctioned $21 billion in 10-year
debt and $13 billion in 30-year bonds that week, the same as the
primary dealers forecast for next week.  
 In February, the U.S. tied the $81 billion November record
when it sold $40 billion of three-year notes, $25 billion of 10-
year securities and $16 billion of 30-year bonds.
