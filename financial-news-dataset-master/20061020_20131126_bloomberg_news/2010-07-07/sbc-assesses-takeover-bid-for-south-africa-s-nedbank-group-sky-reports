             HSBC Holdings Plc  is in the early
stages of assessing a bid for Nedbank Group Ltd., majority owned
by Old Mutual Plc, Sky News reported, without attribution.  
 HSBC has appointed Lazard Ltd. to advise on a possible
takeover deal and there are no current talks between Old Mutual
and potential buyers of its Nedbank stake, Sky said.  
 HSBC spokesman Adrian Russell declined to comment by
telephone. A spokesman for Lazard declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News and a message left on the mobile
phone of Old Mutual spokesman Patrick Bowes was not immediately
returned.
