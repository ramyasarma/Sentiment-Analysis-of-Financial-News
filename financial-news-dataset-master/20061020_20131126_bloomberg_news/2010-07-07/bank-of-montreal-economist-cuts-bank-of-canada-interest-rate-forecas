             The Bank of Montreal reduced its
forecast for how fast Canada’s central bank will raise its key
interest rate, citing Europe’s debt crisis and evidence of
sluggish U.S. economic growth.  
 The Bank of Canada will raise its  main rate  to 1 percent by
the end of the year from today’s 0.5 percent, said economist
 Michael Gregory , compared with a June 3 prediction of 1.25
percent. The benchmark rate will be 2.5 percent at the end of
2011, he added, versus the prior forecast of 3.25 percent.  
 Governor  Mark Carney  raised the policy rate June 1 from a
record low and said future moves would depend on the pace of
 growth  in Canada weighed against signs of an uneven global
recovery and the potential effects of some European government
deficits. The U.S. this month reported a smaller-than-expected
gain in payroll employment and a larger-than-expected drop in
 factory orders .  
 “There will be a lot of uncertainty about whether the U.S.
economy will slow and augment the risks that are already out
there in Europe,” Gregory said in a telephone interview from
Toronto. “We just wanted our forecast to reflect a greater
degree of caution.”  
 The next rate announcement is July 20, and Gregory still
predicts an increase at that meeting to 0.75 percent.
