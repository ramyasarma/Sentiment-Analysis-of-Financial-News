             Cocoa futures climbed for the first
time in three sessions in New York as rain slowed production in
Ivory Coast, the world’s largest producer. Coffee also rose.  
 The Ivory Coast’s central-western Daloa region, the biggest
cocoa-growing area, got 55.8 millimeters (2.2 inches) of rain
from June 21 to June 30, up from 37 millimeters a year earlier,
according to the National Meteorological Service. Futures have
advanced 21 percent in the past 12 months.  
 Rain has “definitely slowed production and has impacted
the beans a little bit” in the West African nation, said  Phil Streible , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker
in Chicago. “The entire process has slowed, which is going to
apply upside pressure to prices.”  
 Cocoa for September delivery rose $14, or 0.5 percent, to
$2,981 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, cocoa futures for September
delivery rose 9 pounds, or 0.4 percent, to 2,403 pounds ($3,653)
a metric ton.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery rose 5.4
cents, or 3.4 percent, to $1.6305 a pound in New York. The price
has climbed 20 percent this year.  
 In the week ended June 29, hedge-fund managers and other
large speculators increased their net-long positions in coffee
futures, or bets that prices will rise, to the highest level
since March 2008. Through yesterday,  inventories  monitored by
ICE have slumped 29 percent this year to the lowest level since
August 2002.  
 Robusta-coffee futures for September delivery climbed $19,
or 1.2 percent, to $1,669 a metric ton in London. The price has
jumped 29 percent this year.
