             Tam SA , the owner of Brazil’s biggest
airline by market share, climbed the most in three weeks as a
rise in flight demand at its largest rival eased concern that
increased competition will spur lower prices.  
 Tam jumped 6.9 percent, the most since June 15, to 26.75
reais in Sao Paulo trading.  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA ,
the second-biggest carrier, climbed 2.4 percent to 22.28 reais
after saying in a regulatory filing today that demand for its
flights increased 10 percent in June from the same month last
year.  
 “The numbers should mitigate the outlook for a price
war,” said  Felipe Rocha , an analyst at Link Corretora in Sao
Paulo. “Investors see the risk diminishing.”  
 Link has an “outperform” rating on the shares of both
companies.
