             South African Finance Minister Pravin
Gordhan said he will meet with the Auditor-General and the
chairman of Parliament’s committee on public accounts to discuss
the purchase of soccer World Cup tickets by government
departments.  
 Government departments must have “restraint and
discernment” in using public funds, Gordhan said in an e-mailed
statement today. Director-generals in charge of national
government departments are responsible for public funds and
accountable to Parliament, he said.
