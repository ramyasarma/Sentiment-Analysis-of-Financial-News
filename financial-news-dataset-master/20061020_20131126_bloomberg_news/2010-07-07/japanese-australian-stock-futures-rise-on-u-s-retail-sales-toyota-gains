             Japanese and Australian  stock   futures 
rose as a U.S. trade group said retail sales in the world’s
biggest economy grew at the fastest pace in four years,
bolstering optimism that consumer spending is strengthening.  
 American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. , which
counts North America as its biggest market outside Japan, closed
2.1 percent up from the Tokyo close yesterday. Those of  Canon
Inc. , a camera maker that receives about 27 percent of its
revenue from the Americas, rose 2.3 percent. ADRs of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company, gained 2.2
percent from the Sydney close as commodity prices advanced.  
 “The focus now is on how the U.S. economy is doing,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $450 million at Tokyo-based
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “The general consensus was
that the economy was going to deteriorate, and the good retail
sales put a brake on that view.”  
 Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September closed at 9,535 in Chicago yesterday, 2.9
percent higher than 9,260 in Osaka. They were  bid  in the pre-
market at 9,530 as of 8:05 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225 closed
at 9,279.65 yesterday.  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  rose 2 percent
today. New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  gained 0.7 percent.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  dropped 0.5 percent yesterday,
the first decline in three days, after the Institute for Supply
Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses showed U.S.
service industries fell more than expected. The decrease led to
the average price of shares in the gauge to trade at 13.8 times
estimated  earnings , near the lowest level since December 2008.  
 U.S. Retail Sales  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped 0.1
percent. Yesterday, the gauge rallied 3.1 percent in New York,
after the International Council of Shopping Centers trade group
said U.S. retailers’ sales are growing at the fastest pace in
four years. Banks advanced as second-quarter operating profit of
 State Street Corp. , the third-largest U.S. custody bank, beat
estimates.  
 The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including
copper and zinc gained 0.4 percent yesterday. Crude oil for
August delivery jumped 2.9 percent to $74.07 a barrel in New
York. Copper futures for September delivery advanced 1.5 percent.  
 The yen depreciated to as low as 87.82 against the dollar
today, compared with 87.49 at the close of stock trading in
Tokyo yesterday. Against the euro, it fell to as much as 110.92
from 110.09. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at Japanese
companies converted into their home currency.  
 Aeon Co. , the Japanese operator or supermarkets and
convenience stores, may be active today after it posted first-
quarter net income of 19.3 billion yen, rebounding from a net
loss of 2.49 billion yen a year earlier.  
 AU Optronics Corp. , Taiwan’s second-largest flat-panel
maker may be active today after it said in a filing to the
Taiwan Stock Exchange that June sales rose 38 percent to NT$41
billion from a year earlier.
