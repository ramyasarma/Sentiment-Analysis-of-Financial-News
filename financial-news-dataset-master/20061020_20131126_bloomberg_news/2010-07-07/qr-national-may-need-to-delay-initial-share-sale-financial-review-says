             QR National, a Queensland state-owned
freight business, may need to delay its planned A$3 billion
initial share sale because market conditions for new floats may
worsen, the Australian Financial Review said, citing Queensland
Investment Corp. Chief Executive Officer Doug McTaggart.  
 The Anna Bligh-led state government is under pressure to
delay the float until February or March, the newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information.
