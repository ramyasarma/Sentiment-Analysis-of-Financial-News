             President  Barack Obama  bypassed the
U.S. Senate and appointed  Donald Berwick  as administrator of the
Centers for  Medicare  and Medicaid Services, the agency that
administers the health programs for the elderly and low-income
Americans.  
 Obama put Berwick in the job today using a recess
appointment, a procedure that lets the president fill positions
without Senate confirmation when Congress isn’t meeting.
Lawmakers are on a week-long break for the Independence Day
holiday.  
 “It’s unfortunate that at a time when our nation is facing
enormous challenges, many in Congress have decided to delay
critical nominations for political purposes,” Obama said in a
statement.  
 The president also announced recess appointments of  Joshua Gotbaum  as director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and
Philip E. Coyle III as associate director for national security
and international affairs in the president’s Office of Science
and Technology Policy.  
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which
oversee the two government programs that affect more than  100
million  poor, elderly and disabled Americans, haven’t had a
permanent administrator since October 2006.  
 Berwick is president and chief executive officer of the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and a professor at Harvard
Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. Obama
nominated Berwick for the job in April.  
 ‘Sneak’  
 Senate Republican Leader  Mitch McConnell  criticized Obama
for trying to “sneak” Berwick’s nomination through the Senate
without “public scrutiny.”  
 “Apparently the Obama administration intends to arrogantly
circumvent the American people yet again,” McConnell, of
Kentucky, said in a statement.  
 AFL-CIO President  Richard Trumka  said in a statement that
“there is no better individual than Dr. Berwick to lead the
effort to transform our health-care system into one that
provides every patient with the best possible care at every
interaction.”
