             Italy’s Alessandro Petacchi won stage
four of the Tour de France as Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland
kept the race-leading yellow jersey.  
 Petacchi, who rides for the Lampre team, won in a sprint
finish for his second stage win of this edition. Defending
champion Alberto Contador and seven-time winner Lance Armstrong
were among race contenders to finish in the main pack after the
flat 95-mile ride between Cambrai and Reims.
