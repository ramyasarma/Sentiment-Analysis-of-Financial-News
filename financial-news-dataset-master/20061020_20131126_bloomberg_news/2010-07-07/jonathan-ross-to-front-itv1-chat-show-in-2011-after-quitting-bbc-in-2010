             TV chat show host  Jonathan Ross  is
joining  ITV Plc , the U.K.’s biggest commercial broadcaster,
after quitting rival British Broadcasting Corp. this year.  
 Ross will present a chat show for the company’s flagship
television channel ITV1 to be broadcast in late 2011 and early
2012, ITV said in a statement today. Ross had a three-year
contract worth 18 million pounds ($27.4 million) with the BBC.
Terms of the contract with London-based ITV weren’t disclosed.  
 “After a short break I will be rolling up my sleeves and
creating a brand new show for ITV1,” Ross said in the
statement. “I have worked successfully with most of the key
figures at the network in the past and cannot wait to get back
on screen with a fast, funny and unpredictable new talk show.”  
 Ross was embroiled in controversy for his BBC Radio 2 show
last year when the broadcaster was fined 150,000 pounds by media
watchdog Ofcom for “offensive” comments he and co-host  Russell Brand  made about the granddaughter of actor Andrew Sachs.  
 Ross and Brand left obscene messages on the answering
machine of Sachs, an actor best known for playing the waiter
Manuel in the 1970s television comedy “Fawlty Towers.” Ross
was suspended for 12 weeks without pay and Brand and the head of
BBC Radio 2 resigned after the broadcast.
