             R.  Allen Stanford , the Texas
financier accused U.S. of leading a $7 billion investment-fraud
scheme, lost another bid for pre-trial release.  
 U.S. District Judge  David Hittner  in Houston today denied
Stanford’s request for bail for the third time, rejecting
arguments that the 19 months he will spend in jail before his
January trial add up to a violation of his constitutional rights
and that he can’t adequately ready his case while locked up.  
 Although conditions at Houston’s federal  detention  center
are “much less ‘posh’ than Stanford prefers, there is no
evidence that it is so burdensome as to impede his ability to
prepare for trial,” Hittner wrote. Prosecutors opposed the bid,
arguing the financier might disappear if freed.  
 Stanford, 60, is accused in a 21-count indictment of
defrauding those who bought certificates of deposit issued by
his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. Held without
bail since June 2009, he maintains his innocence.  
 Lead defense attorney, Robert Bennett of Houston, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment. Harvard University
law professor  Alan Dershowitz  assisted in drafting the bail
request.  
 The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09cr342, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Texas (Houston).
