             Hungary’s central bank policy makers
voted six to one to keep the  benchmark two-week deposit rate 
unchanged at 5.25 percent for a second month in June, the rate-
setting Monetary Council said.  
 Rate setter  Tamas Banfi  voted for a reduction to 5 percent,
the council said in the minutes of the June 21 meeting, posted
on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s  website  today.  
 The central bank halted 10 months of rate cuts in May after
the forint weakened on concern Europe’s debt crisis may spread
and after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s new government signaled
it may pursue laxer fiscal policy. The cabinet has since
reversed course and pledged to meet the country’s creditor-
approved budget-deficit target.  
 “Primarily, it is a deterioration in the risk assessment
that is currently preventing further monetary easing,” the
Monetary Council said.  
 Investors are forecasting that the central bank will
increase interest rates within the next six months. The six-
month forward rate agreement is at 5.48 percent, or 0.33
percentage points above the key rate. The Monetary Council will
hold its next rate-setting meeting on July 19.  
 The  inflation rate  over the monetary-policy horizon of 18
months to two years is seen “around the central bank’s target”
of 3 percent and the outlook is “burdened by risks,” policy
makers said in the statement.
