             The father of  Gilad Shalit , an
Israeli soldier captured by Hamas more than four years ago,
called for Turkey’s help in pressuring the Islamist militant
group to release him,  Milliyet  newspaper said.  
 Noam Shalit, in an interview with Milliyet editor Cinar
Oskay at a benefit concert in Kfar Aza, Israel, suggested
Turkey’s relations with Hamas could be used to pressure the
organization to release his son, Milliyet said.  
 Gilad Shalit has been held since June 2006, when he was
captured in a raid on an Israeli army outpost on the border with
the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.
