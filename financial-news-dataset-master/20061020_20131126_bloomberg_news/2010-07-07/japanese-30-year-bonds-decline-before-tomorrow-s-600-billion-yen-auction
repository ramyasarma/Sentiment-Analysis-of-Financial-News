             Japan’s 30-year  bonds  fell for a
third day on speculation demand will weaken at an auction of the
securities tomorrow after the extra yield offered over 10-year
rates narrowed to the least in a year.  
 Longer-maturity bonds also dropped on concern tumbling
support for Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  will hurt his party in
upper-house election on the weekend and hamper its efforts to
raise the sales tax. The Ministry of Finance will sell 600
billion yen ($6.86 billion) in 30-year bonds tomorrow after
auctioning 2.2 trillion yen of 10-year debt yesterday.  
 “The recent flattening of the yield curve seems to be
overdone, making 30-year bonds slightly unattractive relative to
10-year debt,” said  Hirokata Kusaba , a senior economist in
Tokyo at Mizuho Research Institute Ltd., a unit of Japan’s
third-largest banking group by market value.  
 The yield on the 30-year bond rose 3.5 basis points to 1.91
percent as of 3:31 p.m. in Tokyo, at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 2.3 percent
security due March 2040 fell 0.718 yen to 107.388 yen.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.08 to
141.52 as of the afternoon close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The  yield  on the 10-year note, which was sold yesterday, was
little changed at 1.14 percent.  
 The difference in yield, or  spread , between 10- and 30-year
yields shrank to 74 basis points on July 2, the lowest since May
2009. It widened to 77 basis points today.  
 A yield curve is a chart that plots the rates on bonds of
the same quality and different maturities. It steepens when
yields on shorter-maturity notes fall, those on longer-dated
bonds rise, or both happen simultaneously.  
 Weekend Election  
 Japan’s governing coalition may lose its majority in the
July 11 upper house election, the Sankei newspaper reported
yesterday, citing a telephone survey. Kan’s Democratic Party of
Japan may struggle to retain its 54 seats, while People’s New
Party, the junior coalition partner, may win only one seat, the
newspaper said.  
 “If the DPJ fails to secure 50 seats, the risk premium on
longer-maturity debt may increase again after earlier declining
due partly to Kan’s strong commitment to fix the nation’s
finances,” said  Hiroshi Nakamura , Tokyo-based general manager
of the fixed-income investment department at Mizuho Asset
Management Co.  
 The Sankei’s survey also showed Kan approval rating fell
10.7 percentage points from June 19-20 to 43.6 percent. The 30-
year yield dropped to 1.795 percent on July 2, the lowest since
December 2008.  
 Machinery Orders  
 The decline in bonds was tempered before reports that
economists said will show manufacturing contracted in Japan and
slowed in Germany, boosting demand for the safety of debt.  
 Japanese machinery orders fell 3 percent in May from the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey before the
government report tomorrow. German factory orders grew 0.3
percent, compared with a 2.8 percent jump in April, a separate
survey showed before today’s report.  
 “Given downside risks to the global economy, bonds are not
a sell,” said  Satoshi Okumoto , an investment manager in Tokyo
for Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co., which oversees the
equivalent of more than $60 billion.  
 Ten-year yields declined to 1.055 percent on July 1, the
lowest since August 2003, as U.S. job reports and the lingering
debt crisis in Europe exacerbated concern the global economic
recovery will falter.  
 Japan’s bonds handed investors a return of 2.2 percent
between January and June, the best first half since 2001,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp’s Merrill
Lynch & Co. unit.
