             Coal shipments from Australia’s
Newcastle, the world’s biggest export port for the power station
fuel, fell 13 percent last week while the number of vessels
waiting to load shortened.  
 The volume exported in the week ended 7 a.m. local time
July 5 dropped to 1.84 million metric tons from 2.11 million
tons in the preceding period, Newcastle Port Corp. said on its
website today. Rio Tinto Group,  Xstrata Plc  and BHP Billiton Ltd.
are among mining companies that ship the fuel from the harbor.  
 Twelve vessels  were outside the harbor, down from 61 a week
earlier. Fifty-three vessels were traveling to the port to load
coal, Newcastle Port said.  
 Coal ships waited to load for an average of 12.83 days,
down from 15.17 days, the port said in its report. That compares
with 0.57 day for general-cargo vessels.  
 Power-station coal prices at Newcastle, an Asian benchmark,
rose by 1 percent, according to the  globalCOAL  NEWC Index.
Prices climbed to $98.29 a ton from $97.31 in the week ended
July 2.
