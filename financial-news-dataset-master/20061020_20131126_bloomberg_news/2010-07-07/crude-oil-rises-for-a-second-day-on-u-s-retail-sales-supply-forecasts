             Crude oil climbed to the highest in a
week as gains in U.S. retail sales and a drop in crude
inventories added to signs of a recovery in the world’s largest
energy consumer.  
 Oil rallied 2.9 percent yesterday from a four-week low
after the International Council of Shopping Centers estimated
 retail sales  expanded at the fastest pace in four years. U.S.
crude stockpiles fell 2 percent to 351.8 million barrels last
week, the biggest drawdown since September, according to the
American Petroleum Institute.  
 “The retail sales numbers in the U.S., after a whole host
of disappointing data recently, provided a boost to sentiment,”
said  Toby Hassall , a commodity analyst at CWA Global Markets Pty
in Sydney. “Considering the falls we’ve had in equity markets
and other asset markets, there are those looking at these crude
price declines and viewing them as excessive.”  
 Crude for August delivery rose as much as $1.03, or 1.4
percent, to $75.10 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $74.57 at 2:21 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract increased $2.09 to
$74.07, the highest settlement in a week. Futures are down 6.1
percent so far this year.  
 U.S. retail sales probably expanded at an average monthly
rate of 4 percent in the five months to June, the New York-based
ICSC said before a report today. Retailers may have bucked last
month’s drop in consumer confidence that threatened to temper
the rebound, it said.  
 Oil Supplies  
 Commercially held U.S. crude stockpiles declined for a
second week to the lowest since March, the industry-funded API
said. The Energy Department may report a 2 million-barrel
drawdown today, based on the  median estimate  from 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 U.S. gasoline demand jumped to a five-week high as drivers
filled their tanks for the July 4 holiday weekend, according to
MasterCard Inc. Motorists bought an average 9.65 million barrels
a day in the week ended July 2, the second-largest payments
network company said yesterday in its SpendingPulse report.  
 Gasoline  inventories increased 100,000 barrels last week
from 218.1 million, according to the median analyst estimate
before the Energy Department’s report at 11 a.m. in Washington.,
 Distillate fuel  stockpiles, including heating oil and diesel,
probably gained 1.6 million barrels from 159.4 million.  
 Global Demand  
 The Energy Department yesterday raised its outlook for
global oil demand this year to 85.82 million barrels a day from
85.51 million in June, an increase of 1.9 percent from 2009. In
its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook, the department also
forecast an average oil price of $78.69 a barrel from $61.66
last year.  
 The dollar declined for a third day against the euro,
bolstering speculative demand for commodities. The 16-nation
euro reached $1.2688, the highest since May 12. Asian stocks
extended a global rally amid optimism the global economy will
sustain a recovery.  
 Brent crude for August delivery climbed as much as 92 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $74.43 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was at $73.86 at 2:19 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, the contract gained $2.06, or 2.9 percent, to
settle at $73.51, ending a seven-day losing streak.
