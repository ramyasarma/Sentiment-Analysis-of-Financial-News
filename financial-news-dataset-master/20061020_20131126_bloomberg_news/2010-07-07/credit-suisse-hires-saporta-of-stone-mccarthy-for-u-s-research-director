             Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve, said  Dana Saporta  has joined as a director in U.S. economics from Stone &
McCarthy Research Associates.  
 Saporta has 22 years experience analyzing the U.S. economy,
including 14 years as an economist at Stone & McCarthy in
Skillman, New Jersey. She reports to chief economist  Neal Soss 
and is based in New York, according to Katherine Herring, a
spokeswoman for Credit Suisse. Saporta began work June 30.  
 In an effort to enhance and broaden the firm’s economics
research, Saporta will be specializing in the analysis of Fed
policy, money markets and financial flows. Focus on Fed policy
has increased since the collapse of the subprime market in 2007
caused the central bank to cut rates to near zero and expand its
balance sheet to more than $2 trillion through special programs
including purchases of fixed-income securities.  
 Saporta also worked as an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort
and Citigroup Inc.  
 Primary dealers serve as counterparties for the Fed in
open-market operations, the central bank’s mechanism for
maintaining its  target rate  for overnight loans between banks.
They are also expected to bid or offer securities when the
Treasury sells or buys bills, notes and bonds.
