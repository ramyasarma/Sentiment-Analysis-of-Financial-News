             Soybean futures jumped the most in
eight months and corn closed at the highest price since January
on speculation that heavy rain will reduce yields in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest grower and exporter of the crops.  
 In the Midwest, some fields got more than 10 inches (25
centimeters) of rain since June 7, or three times the normal
amount, data from the  Midwest Regional Climate Center  show. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture reduced its condition ratings for
corn and soybeans for two straight weeks.  
 “The crops are now getting smaller,” said  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.
“There has been too much rain.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 32.5 cents, or
3.6 percent, to $9.325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest gain since Oct. 12. Earlier, the most-active
contract reached $9.3575, the highest level since June 23.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 10 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $3.8925 a bushel, the highest settlement for the
most-active contract since Jan. 12. The price gained 6.7 percent
last week after the government said U.S. farmers planted less
than they intended this year.  
 As of July 4, 71 percent of the corn crop was in good or
excellent  condition , down from 73 percent a week earlier, the
USDA said yesterday. About 66 percent of  soybeans  got the best
ratings, down from 75 percent three weeks ago.  
 Lower Yields  
 Based on yesterday’s USDA ratings, average corn yields may
fall to 161.6 bushels an acre, according to  Seth Meyer , an
agricultural economist at the University of Missouri in
Columbia. That would trail a projected 162.3 bushels a week
earlier and a record 164.7 bushels last year. In June, the USDA
forecast 163.5 bushels.  
 U.S. soybean yields may drop to 42.4 bushels an acre this
year from the week-earlier projection of 42.7 bushels, Meyer
said. In June, the USDA forecast that yields would decrease to
42.9 bushels on average from last year’s record 44 bushels.  
 “The excessive moisture in the Midwest seems to be
reducing conditions and yields,” Meyer said in a  report .  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
