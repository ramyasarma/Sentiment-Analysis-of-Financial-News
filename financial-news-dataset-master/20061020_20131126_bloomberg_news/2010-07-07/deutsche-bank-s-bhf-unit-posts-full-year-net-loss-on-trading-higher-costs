             BHF-Bank AG , acquired by  Deutsche
Bank AG  when it took over Sal. Oppenheim Group, posted a loss in
2009 on a trading deficit and rising costs.  
 The net loss of 5 million euros ($6.3 million) compared
with a profit of 187 million euros a year earlier, according to
the bank’s  annual report . BHF had a trading loss of 6 million
euros last year after a 90 million-euro profit in 2008, and
administrative costs rose 6.3 percent to 336 million euros.
Pretax profit was 2 million euros last year.  
 Deutsche Bank agreed in October to buy Sal. Oppenheim,
Germany’s biggest independent private bank, to expand its asset
and wealth management business. Deutsche Bank, which acquired
BHF with the purchase, has said it’s examining “various
strategic options” for the unit.  
 Sal. Oppenheim, family run for seven generations, put
itself up for sale after reporting the first loss since World
War II in 2008 after investments soured. The bank had a net loss
of 1.19 billion euros in 2009, according to a filing in the
German federal gazette.
