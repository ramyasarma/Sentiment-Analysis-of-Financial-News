             Chrysler LLC, seeking to expand
sales outside the U.S., may develop a factory in Russia with
Canadian auto-parts maker  Magna International Inc. (MG) , which
recently partnered with billionaire investor  Oleg Deripaska .  
 Chrysler, the third-largest U.S. automaker, needs to build
vehicles in Russia in the next two to three years to be
competitive there, Michael Manley, executive vice president of
international sales and marketing, said today.  
 Expansion in Russia, one of the world's fastest-growing car
markets, is part of Chrysler's plan to double international
sales within five years, from 206,000 last year, Manley told
reporters at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt. Magna,
which already assembles cars for Chrysler in Austria, has
negotiated to build cars in Russia with the country's two
biggest automakers.  
 ``Clearly that's a potential option,'' Manley said,
referring to Magna. ``But who knows where Magna and Deripaska
are going to take their relationship?'' Their collaboration
``may open up opportunities for us to work closely together in
Russia,'' he said. ``It may not.''  
 Tracy Fuerst, a spokeswoman for Aurora, Ontario-based Magna,
said the company had no comment on Manley's remarks.  
 General Motors Corp. (GM) , the world's largest carmaker, is also
looking at ways to expand capacity in Russia and other  emerging
markets , such as Brazil, Chief Executive Officer  Rick Wagoner 
said in interviews yesterday and today. Russia is likely to
become the biggest market for GM's Opel unit, overtaking
Germany, where the division is based, said Carl-Peter Forster,
the head of GM's European business, speaking to reporters today.  
 Chrysler Options  
 Chrysler, based in  Auburn Hills , Michigan, is pursuing
several options, from working with Chery Automobile Co., which
has an agreement to develop small cars with Chrysler in China,
to finding a company with existing Russian capacity, Manley
said.  
 Magna, Canada's largest auto-parts maker and the only auto
supplier to fully assemble cars, won shareholder approval last
month for a $1.5 billion investment by Deripaska, who controls
OAO GAZ, Russia's second-biggest carmaker.  
 Deripaska acquired 20 million Class A shares and the right
to name six of 14 directors on Magna's board, in return for
helping Magna expand into Russia.  
 In May, Magna agreed with AvtoVAZ, Russia's No. 1 car
manufacturer, to build at least 220,000 compact cars a year
together.  
 Magna rose  98 cents to C$91.53 at 4:10 p.m. in Toronto. GM
rose $1.33, or 4.6 percent, to $30.54 at 4:21 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading.
