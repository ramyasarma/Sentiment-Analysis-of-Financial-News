LG Chem Ltd. , South Korea’s biggest
chemicals maker, said it has bought out LG Dow Polycarbonate
Ltd., a joint venture with Dow Chemical Co.  The joint venture is LG Chem’s wholly owned unit as of Oct.
1, Terry Lee, a spokesman at chemicals maker, said by phone in
Seoul today. He declined to give the value of the purchase.  LG Chem has bought Dow Chemical’s 50 percent stake in the
venture, the Maeil Business Newspaper reported earlier, citing
industry officials that it didn’t identify. The venture, LG Dow
Polycarbonate Ltd., has two plants with a total capacity of
170,000 metric tons a year in Yeosu, south of Seoul, according
to its annual report.  Shares  of LG Chem dropped 1.1 percent to 326,500 won at
10:19 a.m. Seoul time, compared with a 0.5 percent gain in the
benchmark Kospi index.  Last year, the joint venture reported 365.9 billion won
($325 million) in revenue. Polycarbonate is a plastic used to
make notebooks and cell phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
