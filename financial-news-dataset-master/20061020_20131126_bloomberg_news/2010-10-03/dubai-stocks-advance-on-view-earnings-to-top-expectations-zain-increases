Egypt’s shares climbed the most in
almost three weeks, leading a rally in the Middle East on rising
investor demand for emerging market assets. Oil last week rose
the most since February, helping push Gulf stocks higher.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE , the country’s
biggest publicly traded lender, climbed to the highest in 13
years and  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE  surged the most in four
months. The  EGX 30 Index  advanced 1.5 percent, the most since
Sept. 13, to 6,736.24 at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  of Gulf stocks rose 0.4 percent.
Israel’s benchmark index gained 0.4.  Emerging-market stock and bond funds are attracting record
investment this year because developing economies are expanding
at a faster pace than the U.S. and Europe, according to EPFR
Global. Investors put a net $30.2 billion into the equity funds
last quarter and year-to-date inflows of $49.4 billion would be
a record annual tally, an EPFR report issued Oct. 1 showed.  “There was a big inflow into emerging markets last week
and that has helped Egypt,” said  Angus Blair , head of research
at Cairo-based investment bank Beltone Financial. “There is a
key shift in sentiment toward emerging markets and global
institutions are starting to focus on it since there is
diminished spending in developing markets.”  European stocks posted the biggest weekly drop in three
months as the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  lost 1.9 percent, compared
with a 3.1 percent weekly gain for the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index . The emerging-markets gauge is up 9.8 percent this year
compared with a 2 percent increase for the Stoxx 600.  Gulf Stocks  Economic growth in developing economies will quicken to 6.8
percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said on July
7, almost three times faster than advanced countries.  Oil rose 6.7 percent last week to close at $81.58 a barrel
in New York, after economic data from the U.S. and China
bolstered optimism that demand is growing in the world’s two
largest energy-consuming countries.  CIB climbed to 43.93 Egyptian pounds, the highest since
February 1997. Orascom Telecom increased 3 percent, the most
since May 30, to 5.19 pounds. The Globe and Mail reported that
Canadian wireless carrier Globalive Communications Corp. may get
a cash injection from the Cairo-based company.  In the United Arab Emirates, the  DFM General Index  gained
0.7 percent and Abu Dhabi’s  index  rose less than 0.1 percent.  Qatar’s  QE Index  and  Bahrain’s  measure climbed 0.3 percent
and Oman’s  MSM30 Index  added 0.4 percent. Kuwait’s  gauge  was
little changed and Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  gained
0.4 percent.  The TA-25 Index rose to 1,231.12 and is less than 1 percent
from the record high of 1,237.85 reached April 6.  The yield on the Israel’s benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note
due January 2020 fell 3 basis points to 4.4 percent as the price
climbed 0.29 shekel to 107.89.  To contact the reporters on this story:
