Corn and soybeans may fall as dry
weather allows for rapid harvesting in the U.S., while rain in
South America improves soil moisture for planting crops.  Eighteen of 31 traders and analysts surveyed from Chicago
to Tokyo on Oct. 1 said corn may fall, while 20 of 33
respondents said soybeans will extend their decline. Corn
futures for December delivery dropped 11 percent to $4.6575 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade last week, the biggest
decline in eight months. Soybeans for November delivery fell 6.1
percent to $10.57 a bushel, the most in 13 months.  Last week’s declines were a surprise to the majority of
respondents surveyed on Sept. 24 who anticipated gains for both
crops. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 51 percent of
the time for corn and 52 percent for soybeans.  Bearish  on corn: 18   Bearish  on soybeans: 20
