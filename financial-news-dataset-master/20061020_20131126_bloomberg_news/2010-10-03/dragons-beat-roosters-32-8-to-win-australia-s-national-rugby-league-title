The St. George Illawarra Dragons beat
the Sydney Roosters 32-8 to win their first National Rugby
League title since entering Australia’s elite rugby league
competition as a joint venture.  Jason Nightingale got two tries as the Dragons, who trailed
8-6 at halftime, outscored the Roosters by five tries to two
last night in front of a crowd of 82,334 at Sydney’s ANZ
Stadium. Dragons stand-off Jamie Soward added 12 points with the
boot.  The  Dragons , who split operations between Sydney and
Wollongong, claimed their first premiership 11 years after
joining the NRL following a merger of the St. George Dragons and
Illawarra Steelers. St. George had won the competition’s
forerunner 15 times, its last victory coming in 1979.  “It’s been a long time coming but we’ve got there,”
Dragons captain  Ben Hornby  told the Nine Network. “We worked so
hard for this.”  The Roosters, based in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, had been
seeking to become the first team in 76 years to win the title
after finishing in last place the previous year.  The Roosters led at halftime after tries from Braith Anasta
and Mitch Aubusson canceled out  Mark Gasnier ’s eighth-minute
opener for the Dragons, who finished the regular season atop the
standings for the second straight year.  Nightingale scored a second-half double which Soward
converted to put the Dragons up 18-8 with 19 minutes to go
before Dean Young and  Nathan Fien  added four-pointers. Soward
added a penalty goal to his five conversions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
