Nojima Corp., a Yokohama-based
operator of electronics shops, offered to acquire the Yokohama
Bay Stars baseball team from Tokyo Broadcasting System Holdings
Inc., the Asahi newspaper reported, citing Nojima President
Hiroshi Nojima.  The newspaper reported last week that Tokyo Broadcasting
System is in talks to sell its 69 percent stake in the baseball
club to JS Group Corp., a Tokyo-based maker of housing
materials.  Nojima told the Asahi in an interview that the Bay Stars
should be acquired by a Yokohama company, according to the
report.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
