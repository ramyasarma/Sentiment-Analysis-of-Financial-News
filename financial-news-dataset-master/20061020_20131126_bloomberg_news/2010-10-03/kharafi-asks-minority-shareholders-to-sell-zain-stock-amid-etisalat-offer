Kuwait’s Kharafi Group is inviting
small shareholders in Mobile Telecommunications Co., known as
 Zain , to join in the sale of a 46 percent stake in Kuwait’s
biggest phone company to Emirates Telecommunications Corp.,
according to an advertisement in  Al-Qabas .  The advertisement by National Investments Co., which is
controlled by the Kharafi Group, addresses shareholders who own
no more than 300,000 Zain shares. The Kharafi Group is the
second-largest shareholder in Zain, with about 13 percent.  Etisalat, as Emirates Telecommunications is known, offered
1.7 Kuwaiti dinars ($5.98) to buy a majority stake in Zain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
