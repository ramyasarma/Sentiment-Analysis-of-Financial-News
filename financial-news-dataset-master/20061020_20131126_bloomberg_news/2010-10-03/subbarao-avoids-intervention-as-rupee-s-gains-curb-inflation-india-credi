The Reserve Bank of India will avoid
intervening in the foreign-exchange market for the 11th
consecutive month as the relative strength of the rupee, Asia’s
second best-performer in September, helps curb  inflation .  The central bank will refrain from attempts to influence
the exchange rate in October even as the currency’s 4.4 percent
surge against the dollar erodes earnings for  exporters ,
according to nine of 10 banks surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Standard Chartered Plc said policy makers may take steps to
reduce swings in the currency.  Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao is focusing
on cooling inflation in the world’s second-most populous nation,
where more than 70 percent of residents live on less than $2 a
day. India’s foreign-currency  reserves  rose 0.4 percent in the
past year, the least among Asia’s 10 biggest economies, as
measures to limit currency gains boosted China’s holdings by 15
percent, Japan’s 2 percent, Taiwan’s 14 percent and South
Korea’s 16 percent.  “The RBI is unlikely to intercept the rupee as that would
boost money supply and aggravate inflationary pressures,”  Andy Ji , senior currency strategist in Singapore at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc, the world’s fifth-biggest currency trader, said in
a Sept. 30 interview. “Exports are relatively a small part of
India’s economy and hence, a lesser policy concern.”  Exports of goods make up less than 20 percent of gross
domestic product, compared with about 60 percent in South Korea
and 30 percent in Indonesia. Annual growth in  overseas sales 
slowed to 22.5 percent in August, from 54 percent in March, a
government report showed on Oct. 1.  Smoothing Volatility  The rupee touched 44.2350 per dollar today, the highest
level in more than five months, after central bank data showed
capital inflows more than offset a record  current-account 
deficit in the first quarter of this fiscal year. The  capital
account  showed a surplus of $17.5 billion in the three months
through June, compared with a shortfall of $13.7 billion in the
current account, the Reserve Bank said in a Sept. 30 report.  The last time the rupee appreciated as much as in September
was May 2009, when it jumped 6.4 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Reserve Bank  sold  the equivalent of
more than $1 billion in rupees the following month, the most
since August 2008, data on its website show.  The Reserve Bank intervenes in the market “only to smooth
volatility, which is harmful to trade and investment,” Subbarao
said in Washington on April 26.  Alpana Killawala , a spokeswoman
for the central bank in Mumbai, declined to comment on Oct. 1.  ‘Currency War’  Japan intervened for the first time since 2004, selling
2.12 trillion yen ($25.5 billion) from Aug. 28 through Sept. 28,
the Ministry of Finance said in Tokyo on Sept. 30. Brazil’s
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  warned last week of a global
“currency war” as his government weighs a higher tax on
capital inflows. Thai Finance Minister  Korn Chatikavanij  said
Sept. 17 rising currency reserves indicate the central bank has
been buying dollars.  India’s foreign- currency reserves  were $264.5 billion as of
Sept. 24 while its total external debt was $273 billion at the
end of June, according to central bank data. China’s reserves
totaled $2.45 trillion as of June 30 while that of Japan
measured $1.01 trillion at the end of August.  The Indian central bank has kept out of the currency market
even as its own  trade-weighted index  for the rupee against a
basket of 36 currencies has risen above 100 since April,
signaling overvaluation, according to data on its website. The
so-called real effective exchange rate index was 100.87 in July.  Gains ‘Still Modest’  The rupee lagged behind the 5.1 percent gain in the South
Korean won in September and its 4.3 percent advance this year
ranks sixth among Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies.  “The rupee’s gains so far in 2010 still look modest when
compared to other Asian currencies and so policy makers probably
don’t have much reason for concern yet,”  Priyanka Chakravarty ,
a Mumbai-based foreign-exchange strategist at Standard Chartered,
the U.K. bank that earns most of its profit from emerging
markets, said in a Sept. 30 interview. “They may still act to
reduce market volatility after the recent sharp movements.”  The rupee’s so-called relative strength index, a technical
indicator based on trading patterns, surged on Oct. 1 to a one-
year high of 82 from 38.5 on Aug. 31. Readings above 70 indicate
a currency may have risen too fast and is poised for a reversal.  Risk Reversal  Implied volatility on one-month dollar-rupee options has
jumped to 9.1 percent from a five-month low of 7.3 percent
reached Sept. 13, Bloomberg data show. The gauge of expected
swings in exchange rates, quoted by traders as part of option
prices, is below the 11.2 percent average of the past three
years.  One-month options granting the right to sell the rupee
against the dollar cost 0.7 percentage point more than contracts
that allow purchases at the end of last week, up from a 16-month
low of 0.31 points reached on Sept. 20, Bloomberg data show.  The Indian currency’s so-called one-month 25-delta risk-
reversal rate, which peaked this year in May at 6 percentage
points, is still lower than 2.5 points for Brazil’s real and 1.5
points for Russia’s ruble.  The rupee has rallied as overseas  investors  added a net
$19.3 billion to holdings of Indian stocks and $10 billion to
holdings of local debt this year, Securities and Exchange Board
of India data show.  Yield Difference  Local-currency government bonds due in 10 years yield 7.94
percent in India, compared with 11.93 percent in Brazil, 7.70
percent in Russia and 3.32 percent in China, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  difference  in yields between Indian
debt due in a decade and similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries
widened to 5.44 percentage points on Oct. 4 from 3.75 percentage
point at the end of 2009.  The yield on the benchmark 7.8 percent note due May 2020
climbed 6 basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, on Oct. 1, the
most in almost three weeks, as India raised 110 billion rupees
selling bonds maturing in 2015, 2022 and 2027.  India sold 40 billion rupees ($898 million) of 7.17 percent,
five-year notes at a maximum yield of 7.7414 percent, according
to the central bank. It auctioned 40 billion rupees of 8.08
percent, 12-year debt at as much as 8.0352 percent. The
government also sold 30 billion rupees of 8.26 percent, 17-year
securities at 8.308 percent.  No ‘Exception’  “The rally in the rupee isn’t an exception as the dollar
has fallen against most currencies, and hence there isn’t really
any urgency to defend competitiveness,”  Krishnamurthy Harihar ,
treasurer in Mumbai at FirstRand Ltd., South Africa’s second-
largest financial-services company, said in an Oct. 1 interview.  Subbarao has raised benchmark interest rates five times
this year, the most in Asia, to curb the fastest inflation in
the region except Pakistan. The average rate of increases in the
nation’s benchmark wholesale price index has jumped almost
sevenfold this year to 9.8 percent, government data show.
Wholesale prices climbed 8.5 percent in August from a year
earlier.  “The RBI has been pretty hands-off during periods of both
rupee strength and weakness,”  Rahul Bajoria , an economist in
Singapore at Barclays Plc, the third-biggest currency trader,
said in a Sept. 30 interview. “Unless capital flows turn really
unmanageable, it is difficult to see intervention.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
