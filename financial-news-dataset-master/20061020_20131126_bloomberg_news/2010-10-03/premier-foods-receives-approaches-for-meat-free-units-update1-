Premier Foods Plc , maker of Hovis
breads, received expressions of interest in its Quorn brand of
meat-free products and related units and may sell them, the
company said.  “The group confirms it has received approaches that may or
may not lead to a sale of its meat-free business, including
Quorn,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today. It
said Premier’s board is “open-minded about disposals, provided
they deliver shareholder value and accelerate the reduction of
average net debt.”  Nestle SA, Unilever NV and  Danone SA  are among the
companies that may be interested in buying Quorn, which is
valued at as much as 250 million pounds ($396 million), the
Sunday Times reported today, citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter. Investment bank N.M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. is
handling the possible sale, the newspaper said.  Premier  in August posted a loss of 40.3 million pounds for
the first half of 2010, attributing the result to a drop in
sales of non-branded items. The company’s chief executive Robert
Schofield said at the time that he was “open-minded” about
selling brands as the company tries to reduce its net debt of
1.365 billion pounds.  Premier’s meat-free products unit generated 64 million
pounds of revenue in the first half, representing 5.4 percent of
total sales, according to the company’s accounts.  Premier  shares have lost 55 percent of their value in
London trading so far this year, giving it a market value of
388.7 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
