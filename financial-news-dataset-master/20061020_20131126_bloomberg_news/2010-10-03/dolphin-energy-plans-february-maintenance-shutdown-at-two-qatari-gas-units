Dolphin Energy Ltd., the Abu Dhabi
state-controlled venture transporting natural gas to the United
Arab Emirates, is planning a monthlong maintenance shutdown at
its two offshore platforms in Qatar next February.  The company is seeking two offshore accommodation rigs to
support work at the seaborne platforms in Qatari waters starting
Feb. 1, according to an advertisement carried in the Dubai-based
newspaper  Gulf News  today. Dolphin Energy issued the tender to
hire the rigs for 28 days, with possible extensions of as much
as two months.  Dolphin is seeking bids by noon Qatar time on Oct. 19,
according to the tender announcement. An outside representative
for the company had no immediate comment.  The Dolphin pipeline, 51 percent-owned by Abu Dhabi’s
Mubadala Development Co., imports about 2 billion cubic feet of
gas daily under long-term supply contracts with state-run Qatar
Petroleum. The U.A.E., which holds about 7 percent of global
crude oil reserves, needs to import gas to fire power plants as
domestic energy demand grows.  Dolphin, in which  Total SA  and  Occidental Petroleum Corp. 
each hold a 24.5 percent stake, has the capacity to increase
imports to 3.2 billion cubic feet a day. Abu Dhabi is one of
seven sheikhdoms comprising the U.A.E.  To contact the reporter on this story:
