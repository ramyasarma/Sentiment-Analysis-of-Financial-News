Shenzhen has introduced greater
restrictions on home purchases to help cool the property market,
the South China Morning Post reported, citing a statement from
the local government.  Families with residency status are now limited to the
purchase of two homes and those without a permit are allowed to
buy one if they can show they have paid taxes in the city for at
least a year, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
