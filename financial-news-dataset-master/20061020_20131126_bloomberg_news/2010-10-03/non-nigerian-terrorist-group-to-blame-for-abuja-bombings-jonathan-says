A small terrorist group from outside
Nigeria carried out the Oct. 1 Independence Day car bombings in
which 12 people died, President Goodluck Jonathan said.  “It is a small terrorist group that resides outside
Nigeria that was paid by some people within to perpetrate the
dastardly act. We are on their trail,” the president said at a
dinner in Lagos, according to an e-mailed statement from the
office of his media adviser, Ima Niboro.  Two explosions in the capital occurred during celebrations
to mark the West African nation’s 50th anniversary of
independence from Britain.  State run television NTA said police have arrested one
person and declared two others wanted in connection with the
bombings. Another arrest has been made in South Africa.  Henry Okah , a leader of the Nigerian rebel group that claimed
responsibility for the car bombs, was arrested in Johannesburg
on Oct. 2, his lawyer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
