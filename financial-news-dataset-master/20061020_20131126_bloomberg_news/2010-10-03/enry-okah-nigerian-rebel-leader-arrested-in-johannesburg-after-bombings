Henry Okah , a leader of the Nigerian
rebel group that claimed responsibility for car bombs that
killed 12 people Oct. 1, was arrested in Johannesburg yesterday,
his lawyer said.  South African authorities cited the country’s anti-
terrorism laws in apprehending Okah, Piet du Plessis said in a
phone interview from Johannesburg today. Okah denies he
committed any “unlawful acts in South Africa or outside the
country,” du Plessis said.  The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta said
yesterday it “deeply regrets” the loss of lives in the capital
Abuja last week during celebrations to mark the West African
nation’s 50th anniversary of independence from Britain.  Okah will probably have a court hearing tomorrow, du
Plessis said. South African police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo
declined to comment immediately when called reached on his
mobile-phone today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
