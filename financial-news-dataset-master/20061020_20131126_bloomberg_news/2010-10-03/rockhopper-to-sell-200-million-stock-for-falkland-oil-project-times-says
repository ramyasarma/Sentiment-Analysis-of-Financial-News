Rockhopper Exploration Plc  is
preparing a $200 million rights offer in the next six weeks to
fund drilling in the Falkland Islands, the Sunday Times
 reported , citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Rockhopper is close to hiring Bank of America Corp. as its
corporate broker, the London-based newspaper said. The company
will use the money to dig more wells off the South Atlantic
islands to establish the size of its field, the Times said.  Ben Simons, a spokesman for Rockhopper, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
