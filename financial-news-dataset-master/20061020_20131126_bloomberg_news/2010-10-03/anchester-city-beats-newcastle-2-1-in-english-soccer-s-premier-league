Manchester City beat Newcastle 2-1 at
Eastlands today in English soccer’s Premier League.  Carlos Tevez gave City an 18th-minute lead, converting a
penalty kick after being fouled by Mike Williamson. Jonas
Gutierrez made it 1-1 six minutes later with a powerful volley,
and a low shot by substitute Adam Johnson gave the home side
victory 15 minutes from the end.  Newcastle forward Hatem Ben Arfa was stretchered off with a
suspected broken leg in the opening minutes after a tackle by
Nigel de Jong.  The win puts City, at least temporarily, into second place
in the league. Leader Chelsea has 15 points, City 14 and
Manchester United 13.  Arsenal plays at champion Chelsea today, and Liverpool
hosts Blackpool.  Yesterday, Manchester United drew 0-0 at Sunderland,
Tottenham beat Aston Villa 2-1, Wigan defeated Wolves 2-0, and
Everton got its first victory of the season, 2-0 at Birmingham.
Stoke defeated Blackburn 1-0 and there were 1-1 draws between
West Brom and Bolton, and West Ham and Fulham.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
