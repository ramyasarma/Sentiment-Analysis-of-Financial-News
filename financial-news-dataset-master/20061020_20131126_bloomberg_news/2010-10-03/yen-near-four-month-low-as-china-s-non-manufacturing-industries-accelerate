The yen traded near a four-month low
against the euro after a Chinese report showed non-manufacturing
industries expanded at a faster pace in September, sapping
demand for Japan’s currency as a refuge.  The  Dollar Index  was close to the lowest in eight months
before a U.S. report that economists said will show pending home
sales rose at a slower pace in August, giving the Federal
Reserve more reason to take credit-easing measures. The euro
fell for the first time in five days against the dollar as
technical charts signaled its recent gains were excessive.  “China’s economic growth looks robust,” said  Yuji Saito ,
director of the foreign-exchange department at Credit Agricole
Corporate and Investment Bank in Tokyo. “This is positive for
risk-taking appetite. The bias is for the yen to be sold.”  The yen traded at 114.72 per euro as of 9:19 a.m. in Tokyo
from 114.78 in New York last week, after falling to 114.99
earlier today, the weakest since May 18. Japan’s currency was at
83.36 per dollar from 83.22. The euro fell to $1.3761 from
$1.3791, after earlier rising to $1.3807, the strongest level
since March 17.  The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against six major counterparts, was at
78.174 from 78.088 on Oct. 1, when it declined to 78.029, the
weakest since Jan. 25.  Japan’s currency fell versus most of its major counterparts
as a purchasing managers’ index released yesterday by the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing increased to 61.7 from
60.1 in August. Numbers above 50 indicate an expansion and below
50 a contraction.  China’s Economy  The Chinese data follow a jump to a four-month high for the
 manufacturing PMI  announced on Oct. 1, underscoring sustained
 growth momentum  in the world’s fastest-growing major economy
even as the government seeks to cool the property market.  “Non-manufacturing activities have been growing rapidly
and in a sound range recently and September’s gain is partly due
to seasonal factors,” the federation said in a statement on its
 website . The growth also reflects “the government’s increased
investment in the service industries as it seeks to adjust the
economic growth model,” the agency said.  The euro fell from a six-month high versus the dollar after
the common currency’s 14-day relative strength index against the
greenback advanced 76 today, above the 70 threshold that
suggests gains may be overdone and can indicate a currency is
about to change direction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
