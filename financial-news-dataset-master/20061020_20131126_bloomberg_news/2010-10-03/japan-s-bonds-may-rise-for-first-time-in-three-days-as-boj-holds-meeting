Japanese government  bonds  rose,
pushing five-year yields to the lowest level in seven years, on
speculation the Bank of Japan will decide to expand monetary
easing measures at a two-day policy meeting that ends tomorrow.  Benchmark 10-year bonds advanced for the first time in
three days as 14 of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
said the central bank will expand its 30-trillion yen ($359
billion) lending facility at the meeting to counter the yen’s
strength. Bonds also gained after a government report today
showed growth in wages unexpectedly halted.  “With stagnant income growth, we can hardly expect
consumer spending to have a positive influence over the
economy,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in Tokyo at
Okasan Securities Co. “The slowing economy is boosting
expectations for the central bank’s monetary easing, and that’s
leading to the resilience of the bond market.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond fell two basis
points to 0.935 percent at 3:12 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1
percent security due September 2020 rose 0.182 yen to 100.591.  Five-year  yields  sank a basis point to 0.24 percent, the
least since June 2003. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery advanced 0.13
to 143.45 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The yen traded at 83.36 per dollar today. Its rally to a
15-year high of 82.88 on Sept. 15 caused Japan to unilaterally
intervene to weaken the currency for the first time since 2004.  BOJ Measures  “Short- to medium-term bonds are expected to remain
resilient because of expectations the Bank of Japan will ease
policy,”  Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist at Tokyo-based
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., wrote in a report today. The
expectations “are most likely to be fulfilled tomorrow.”  The Bank of Japan will boost purchases of five- and 10-year
bonds to cut corporate borrowing costs and spur the nation’s
flagging economy, according to the asset-management unit of
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., the nation’s biggest lender.  The extra  yield  that five-year notes offer over two-year
debt narrowed to 13 basis points, the least since 2003, a sign
investors are piling into the 2015 securities. The difference
between two-and 10-year  rates  shrank to 83 basis points,
approaching a two-year low.  Corporate Debt  “Most corporate bonds in Japan are due in five to 10 years,
so they’ll want those rates to fall,” said  Hideo Shimomura , who
helps oversee the equivalent of $60 billion in Tokyo as chief
fund investor at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. “It’ll be
a surprise if they buy longer maturities.”  Japanese bonds eked out a 0.1 percent return in September,
beating Treasuries and German bunds, on speculation BOJ Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa will act after the government sold yen on Sept.
15. The BOJ won’t rule out any options, including raising bond
purchases, board member Ryuzo Miyao said Sept. 22.  Japan’s  monthly wages  including overtime and bonuses were
unchanged from a year earlier at 274,232 yen, the Labor Ministry
said today in Tokyo. Barclays Capital had projected a 0.6
percent annual advance in pay, while Bank of America Merrill
Lynch had forecast a 1 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
