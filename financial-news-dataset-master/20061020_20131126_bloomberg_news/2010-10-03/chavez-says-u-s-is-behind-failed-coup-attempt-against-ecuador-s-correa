Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  says
the U.S. was behind a failed uprising in Ecuador, in which
President  Rafael Correa  claims he was held against his will in a
hospital by police and soldiers protesting wage cuts.  Washington is supporting coup d’etats against an alliance
of Latin American left-wing countries, known as the Bolivarian
Alliance for the Americas, or ALBA, which was formed by Chavez
to counter U.S. influence in the region, he wrote in his weekly
column “The Lines of Chavez.”  “Let’s not forget, the failed attempt, manufactured by
Washington, was looking not only to bring down Correa’s
government but also the ALBA and Unasur (Union of South American
Nations),” Chavez wrote in the column. The U.S. “has revived
the old measure of coup d’etats to spoil plans of governments
that don’t subordinate to it.”  “In response to the events that happened in Ecuador,
Secretary (of State Hillary) Clinton immediately came out
expressing our support for President Correa,” said Thomas
Mittnacht, head of the press section at the U.S. Embassy in
Caracas. “Any accusations that the U.S. had anything to do with
what happened are without foundation.”  Correa was rescued from a Quito hospital that police
besieged on Sept. 30 in protest of wage cuts. Fighting between
security forces and police, as well as related violence, left
eight people dead and 274 injured, the Health Ministry said.  Correa and Chavez both described the incident as an
attempted coup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
