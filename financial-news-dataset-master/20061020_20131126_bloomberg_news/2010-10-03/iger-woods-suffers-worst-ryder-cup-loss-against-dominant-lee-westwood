Lee Westwood  continued his Ryder Cup
domination of  Tiger Woods  and handed the world’s top-ranked
golfer his worst-ever loss in the competition.  Westwood and fellow Englishman Luke Donald beat Woods and
 Steve Stricker  by six holes with five remaining, or 6 and 5, to
give Europe its first point on a rain-delayed third day at
Celtic Manor in Newport, Wales. The win improves Westwood’s
record against Woods to 6-1 in the competition.  Woods’s previous worst loss came in his first Ryder Cup in
1997 when he and partner  Mark O’Meara  lost 5 and 3 to current
Europe captain  Colin Montgomerie  and Bernhard Langer.  Woods and Stricker also suffered their first loss as a team
after winning their first two matches at the Ryder Cup and going
4-0 in last year’s Presidents Cup.  It was the second win for both Westwood, who also has a
tie, and Donald. It gave Europe its first point of the day and
closed the U.S. lead to 6-5.  Westwood and Donald took control of the match from the
start yesterday, winning the first two holes with birdies. They
increased their advantage to five holes through the seventh
before Stricker made a birdie on the ninth just before played
was halted by darkness.  After a rain delay of five hours and 45 minutes today, the
Englishmen picked right up by making birdies on the 10th and
11th holes to push their lead to six. Donald then made a birdie
putt to tie the 12th hole and Westwood made par to tie the 13th
and close out the match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
