Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said
he will expropriate  Agroislena C.A. , a vendor of agricultural
products, and plans to nationalize 250,000 hectares (618,000
acres) of farmland this month.  Venezuela will seize “double” that in November, and will
keep doing so at “at a gallop” in 2011, he said today on state
television during his weekly show, “Alo Presidente.”  “Agroislena’s time is up, it’s going to belong to the
people,” he said. “How many large estates are ready for the
barbecue?” Representatives at Agroislena couldn’t immediately
be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
