Zenyatta won her 19th consecutive
race in the $250,000 Lady’s Secret Stakes to become the highest
earning filly or mare with career winnings of more than $6.4
million.  The undefeated 6-year-old mare, with jockey Mike Smith
aboard, captured the Lady’s Secret at Hollywood Park in
Inglewood, California, for the third time as she prepares for
her final race, the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic on Nov. 6
at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Last year, she
challenged a field of males to become the first mare to win the
Classic, North America’s richest horse race.  The $150,000 first-place purse in the Lady’s Secret gave
Zenyatta career winnings of $6,404,580. Ouija Board held the
record with $6,312,552.  “It’s unbelievable,” said  Jerry Moss , the mare’s owner
and founder of A&M Records Inc. “I always thought she’d get
there. It’s how she gets there.”  Zenyatta, making her move from her customary last place
among the five entries, ran down Switch with 20 yards left to
the finish line to win the 1 1/16th-mile race by half a length
in one minute, 42.97 seconds. Moon de French and Satans Quick
Chick tied for third.  “The 1 1/16-mile is almost a sprint for her,” said Smith.
“But you have to take your hat off to that 3-year-old filly
Switch.”  Zenyatta, named for the Police’s 1980 album “Zenyatta
Mondatta,” won her 19th victory on lead singer Sting’s 59th
birthday, said owner Ann Moss. “She’s so great.”  Zenyatta paid $2.20 and $2.10 on a $2 bet. Switch, a 3-
year-old filly, returned $2.60 to place.  Zenyatta tied Peppers Pride, who was undefeated as she won
her 19th and final race on Dec. 14, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
