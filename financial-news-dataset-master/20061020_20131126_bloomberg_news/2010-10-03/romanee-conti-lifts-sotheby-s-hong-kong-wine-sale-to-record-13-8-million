Burgundy’s Domaine de la Romanee-
Conti led Sotheby’s two-day wine  sale  in Hong Kong, where Asian
buyers branched out from top Bordeaux labels like Chateau Lafite
Rothschild to extend their dominance in the global wine market.  The auctions tallied HK$107 million ($13.8 million)
including fees, a record for Sotheby’s in the city, which may
overtake New York this year as the world’s biggest wine-auction
market. All 1,366 lots were sold, Sotheby’s said. The presale
high estimate for the two days was HK$74 million.  “The Asian buyers who are driving the international wine
market right now are broadening their horizons,” auctioneer
Robert Sleigh,  Sotheby’s  head of wine for Asia, said in an
interview after the sale. “We’ve now had something like 6,000
consecutive lots sold in almost 2 years in Asia. I’ve never seen
anything like that” said Sleigh, who has worked in the auction
house’s wine department for 14 years.  Romanee-Conti dominated the first day’s sale, from the
cellar of Texan property developer Marcus D. Hiles, with the
priciest 10 lots all coming from the estate and all being bought
by Asian collectors. The top lot was a case of Romanee-Conti
2005 that sold for HK$1,815,000, against a presale high estimate
of HK$1.2 million. A case of the same vineyard’s 2002 fetched
almost HK$1.1 million, more than double its HK$540,000 high
estimate.  The top lot on the second day, from the cellar of an
unidentified American collector, was a set of three double
magnums of Chateau Petrus 1989 that sold for HK$726,000,
compared with a high estimate of HK$400,000. Sale prices include
a 21 percent buyer’s premium, Sotheby’s said.  Art to Follow  The wine sales were part of  Sotheby’s  3,200-lot Hong Kong
auctions this week that the company estimated will raise up to
HK$1.6 billion ($210 million). Sessions beginning today include
contemporary Asian art; a 6.4 carat pink diamond; antiques;
jewelry; and paintings by Chinese masters including abstract
artist Zao Wou-ki.  The auctions will show whether rising wealth in China is
continuing to drive a recovery in art prices. Sotheby’s said the
7-day event has 800 more lots than its April auction in the
city, which took a record HK$2 billion and revived prices in
most categories to pre-credit-crisis levels.  The wine sales are part of four wine auctions Sotheby’s is
holding in Hong Kong this month, including one from the cellars
of  Chateau Lafite  on Oct. 29 with vintages from 1869 to 2009,
followed the next day by a collection of investment-grade
Bordeaux from the wine fund of SK Networks, the trading arm of
one of South Korea’s largest conglomerates, at the Mandarin
Oriental hotel.  Chinese appetite for top Bordeaux and Burgundies such as
Lafite, Petrus and Romanee-Conti helped Hong Kong’s wine
auctions outperform those in New York in the first half of this
year. Sotheby’s said it has sold every lot at its past nine wine
auctions in Asia.  To contact the writer on the story:
