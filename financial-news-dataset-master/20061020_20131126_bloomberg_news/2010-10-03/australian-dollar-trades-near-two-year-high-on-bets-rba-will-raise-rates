The Australian dollar traded near a
two-year high against its U.S. counterpart on speculation the
Reserve Bank will boost borrowing costs tomorrow.  Australia’s currency, called Aussie, has climbed 6 percent
versus the U.S. dollar since Sept. 1 as the central bank
prepares to raise the overnight cash rate target to 4.75 percent
from 4.5 percent, according to economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. New Zealand’s dollar was near the highest since November
against the greenback. U.S. policy makers said they may expand
asset purchases to stimulate their economy.  “All indications are that the bank will be hiking rates,”
 Richard Franulovich , senior currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. in New York, said of the RBA. “You’ve had the
Federal Reserve come out with a fairly dovish statement raising
expectations for a round of asset purchases. The Aussie’s been a
beneficiary of that.”  Australia’s currency was at 96.68 U.S. cents at 1:42 p.m.
in New York. It closed at 97.24 cents on Oct. 1, when it touched
97.51 cents, the highest level since July 2008. The currency
fell 0.4 percent to 80.60 yen, from 80.94 yen. Australia’s
markets were closed today for a holiday.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fetched 74.10
U.S. cents, down 0.5 percent from 74.45 cents. It reached 74.63
cents on Oct. 1, the strongest level since Nov. 19. The kiwi
slipped 0.2 percent to 61.77 yen, from 61.92 yen.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  signaled last month the biggest
mining boom in more than a century may prompt him to extend the
most aggressive round of rate increases  by a Group of 20 member
nation to prevent a build-up of inflation pressures. Policy
makers have left the rate unchanged since May, citing European
debt concerns.  The Fed said Sept. 21 in a policy statement it “is
prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to
support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over
time, to levels consistent with its mandate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
