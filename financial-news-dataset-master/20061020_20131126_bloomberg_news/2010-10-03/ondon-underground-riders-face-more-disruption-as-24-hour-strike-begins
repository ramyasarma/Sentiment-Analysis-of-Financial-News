London Underground  railway workers
have started a second strike over safety and staffing levels,
disrupting the travel plans of 3.5 million customers.  The 24-hour walkout, one of four scheduled in protest
against 800 planned job cuts, began at 6:29 p.m., Geoff Martin,
a spokesman for the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, said by
telephone today.  The stoppage, the fifth to shut London Underground since
2002, involves around 10,000 employees. More than 100 additional
buses, capacity for more than 10,000 extra river crossings and
controlled taxi centers have been organized for the strike
period, according to Transport for London’s website.  During the first 24-hour strike on Sept. 6, Londoners took
to boats, bikes and taxis to get to work. The 24-hour strike may
cost businesses 48 million pounds ($76 million), according to
the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  Negotiations between London Underground and the RMT and the
 Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association  to resolve the dispute
broke down on Sept. 22. TFL said Sept. 30 that the unions were
prepared to resume talks to resolve the dispute.  “We will keep as many stations open as possible and will
run as many trains as we safely can,” London Underground
Managing Director Mike Brown said in an e-mailed statement to
customers on Oct. 1. Further walkouts are planned for Nov. 2 and
Nov. 28.  In a separate dispute over pay and conditions, almost 200
RMT rail workers in the Tube’s Jubilee and Northern depots will
strike for 24 hours starting at 7 p.m. on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
