A fatal train crash in Indonesia’s
Central Java province yesterday was probably caused by human
error, a spokesman for the national railway operator said. The
death toll was lowered to 35 people from an earlier 43, he said.  “After the evacuation, investigation and data collection,
we have identified 35 people who died,” Sugeng Priyono, vice
president of communications at PT Kerata Api Persero, said by
phone today. The investigation showed the crash “was probably
caused by human error,” he said.  An Argo Bromo executive class train traveling to Surabaya
from Jakarta early yesterday slammed into the back of a Senja
Utama business class train that was sitting idle on the same
track in the Petarukan station in Pemalang, Central Java. The
two trains should have been on different tracks, Priyono said
yesterday.  The death and injury toll from a separate train collision
yesterday in Solo, Java, remained at one dead and three injured,
Tunjung Inderawan, director general for trains at Indonesia’s
Ministry of Transportation, said by phone today. That crash is
under investigation, Inderawan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
