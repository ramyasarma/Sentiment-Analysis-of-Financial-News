American International Group Inc. has
had to lower its valuation for an initial public offering of its
AIA Group Ltd. unit in Hong Kong in order to ensure a $1 billion
commitment from the Kuwait Investment Authority and other
“cornerstone investors,” the Financial Times reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.     AIG had to abandon a plan to sell shares in its Asia unit
that would value AIA at $35 billion to $37 billion and after
extensive discussions, KIA has signed up to the share sale on
the basis that AIA will be valued at between $30 billion and $32
billion, the FT said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
