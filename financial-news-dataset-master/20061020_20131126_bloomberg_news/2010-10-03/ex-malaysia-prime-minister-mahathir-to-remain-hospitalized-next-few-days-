Former Malaysian Prime Minister
 Mahathir Mohamad  will remain hospitalized in Australia for the
“next few days” for observation after being admitted yesterday
with a chest infection.  Mahathir, 84, is responding well to medication at the
Epworth Hospital in Melbourne, his spokesman  Sufi Yusoff  said in
an e-mailed statement today. The ex-prime minister arrived in
the country on Sept. 30 to address a seminar on human
development organized by the UMNO Club.  Mahathir stepped down in 2003 after more than two decades
as Malaysia’s premier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
