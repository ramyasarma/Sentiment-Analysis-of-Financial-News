Workforce, ridden by Ryan Moore, won
the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in Paris today, adding to his
triumph in England’s Derby. Nakayama Festa was second, and
Sarafina third.  The winner gave England-based trainer Michael Stoute his
first victory in Europe’s richest race, which is worth about
$3.2 million for first place.  Three-year-old Workforce was returned at odds of 6-1, with
the second and third at 22-1 and 12-1, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported.  The Arc is for three-year-olds and older, over a distance
of 1 1/2 miles.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
