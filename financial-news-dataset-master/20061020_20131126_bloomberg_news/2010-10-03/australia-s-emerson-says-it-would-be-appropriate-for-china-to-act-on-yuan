Australian Trade Minister  Craig Emerson  said it would be “appropriate” for China to adjust its
currency’s exchange rate in response to urgings by the U.S.  “There’s a real issue here,” Emerson said today in an
interview on  Sky News Australia . “Americans are basically fed
up, and I can understand why.” U.S. manufacturing and export
industries are being “artificially disadvantaged” by the
yuan’s value, he said.  The U.S. House of Representatives last week passed a
measure that would let domestic companies petition for duties on
Chinese imports to compensate for the effect of a weak yuan.  “I think it would be an appropriate response if the
Chinese did adjust the exchange rate, Emerson said. ‘‘But I also
know that public calls for doing so tend to be
counterproductive.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
