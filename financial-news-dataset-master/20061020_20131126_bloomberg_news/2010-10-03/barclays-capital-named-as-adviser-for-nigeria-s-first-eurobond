Barclays Capital has been selected as
adviser to Nigeria’s government on a $500 million Eurobond, the
Independent on Sunday reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Newstate Partners, a specialist financial adviser, also bid
for the mandate, the London-based newspaper said.  Finance Minister  Olusegun Aganga  said Sept. 3 that the sale
of Nigeria’s first global bond will act as a benchmark so that
companies can price their bonds accordingly.  To contact the reporters on this story:
