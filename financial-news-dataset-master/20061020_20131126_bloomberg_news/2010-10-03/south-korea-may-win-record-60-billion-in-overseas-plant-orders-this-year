South Korean companies  may win record
overseas plant orders of more than $60 billion this year as
growing demand in the Middle East boosts contracts for power
plants, floating production facilities and refineries.  Orders from overseas customers more than doubled from a
year earlier to $50.7 billion by the end of the third quarter,
South Korea’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy said yesterday.  The Middle East accounts for about 72 percent of the total
as increasing revenue amid high crude prices encourages the
region’s oil producers to spend more money on energy
infrastructure, the ministry said in a statement. South Korean
companies are capitalizing on such investments with their
overseas experience, it said.  “Middle East countries appreciate the efficiency of the
South Korean model,”  Theodore Karasik , director of research at
the Dubai-based Institute for Near East and Gulf Military
Analysis, said by telephone from Dubai. “It’s efficient and
it’s affordable.”  For South Korean companies, deep-pocketed Middle Eastern
countries, unfazed by the economic downturn, are an attractive
market, Karasik said.  Korea Electric Power Corp. won the largest order so far
this year, an $18.6 billion contract in late December to build
four nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates.  Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Co. said Sept. 9 it
received an order worth $3.39 billion to build a 2,800-megawatt
power plant in Saudi Arabia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
