Fisher & Paykel Appliances Holdings
Ltd. , New Zealand’s largest maker of refrigerators, said it is
offering three buildings at its Tamaki site in Auckland for
sale.  The buildings are being offered individually with vacant
possession,  Brett Butterworth , vice president of planning, said
in an interview. An agreement to sell the properties in a single
lot lapsed in April and the company has realigned the boundaries
to allow separate sales which may realize more value, he said.  Fisher & Paykel has shifted much of its manufacturing away
from New Zealand, and has subsequently sold buildings to release
capital and reduce debt. In October last year, it agreed to the
NZ$53 million ($39 million) sale and leaseback of its head
office and other parts of the Tamaki site to Direct Property
Fund.  The three buildings cover 37,304 square meters, the New
Zealand Herald newspaper reported on Oct. 2. A fourth
development site is also available, it said.  Separately, Fisher & Paykel today said it sold most of its
Cleveland site in Queensland, Australia, for A$21.5 million ($21
million) and expects to apply the net proceeds of the
transaction to repay debt.  The company will lease back a small portion of the
warehouse and office facilities and has relocated from another
Brisbane site to Cleveland, it said in a statement sent to the
stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
