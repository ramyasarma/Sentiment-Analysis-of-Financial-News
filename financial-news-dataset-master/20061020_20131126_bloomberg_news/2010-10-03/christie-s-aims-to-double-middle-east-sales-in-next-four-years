Christie’s International , which sold
art and jewelry for $170 million in Dubai over the past four
years, expects to double that in the coming four years amid
rising interest in regional works, its Middle East and Europe
president said.  “The appetite here in the Middle East to buy the very best
artists from your own stable is considerable,”  Jussi Pylkkanen 
said in an interview in the Qatari capital Doha today.  Christie’s has held seven sales in Dubai since opening an
office in 2005 and the Middle East is the London-based auction
house’s fastest growing market in terms of new clients,
Pylkkanen said. The Middle East, Russia and China represent as
much as 30 percent of new buyers, Isabelle de la Bruyere,
director of Christie’s Middle East said at a news conference
today.  Pylkkanen spoke at exhibition of modern regional art
Christie’s is holding this week in Qatar. The exhibition
included works of art to be auctioned in Dubai later this month,
including Mahmoud Said’s 1929 The Whirling Dervishes and
Mohammed Ehsai’s 2009 Banquet.  Christie’s said Aug. 4 that first-half sales rose 46
percent as a recovery in demand buoyed prices. The company sold
1.71 billion pounds ($2.73 billion) of art and antiques in
January through June, compared with 1.2 billion pounds a year
earlier. The figures include buyer’s premium.  Art tends to react in a “counterintuitive” way to
economic slowdowns, Pylkkanen said. The market for works by
 Pablo Picasso  and  Alberto Giacometti  has appreciated 200 percent
in the past four years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
