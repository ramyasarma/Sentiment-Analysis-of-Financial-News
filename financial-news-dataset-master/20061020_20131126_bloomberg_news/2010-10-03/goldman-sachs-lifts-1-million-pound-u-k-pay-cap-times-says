Goldman Sachs Group Inc . lifted the
pay cap for U.K. employees it imposed amid public criticism over
banker bonuses, the Sunday Times  reported , citing unidentified
people familiar with the situation.  Goldman Sachs waived its 1 million-pound ($1.6 million)
annual limit in August, when it granted interim bonuses to halt
an exodus of senior personnel, the newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
