Hypo Real Estate Group  completed the
transfer of loans and securities worth around 173 billion euros
($239 billion) to the lender’s so-called bad bank, FMS 
Wertmanagement.  The transfer was the largest of its kind in Germany to date
and marks a “key milestone” in the restructuring of Hypo Real
Estate, the Munich-based bank said in an e-mailed statement.  “Our new core bank, pbb Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, has
retained those assets that match its strategic focus and we will
concentrate on writing new business in our European core
markets,” Chief Executive Officer  Manuela Better  said.  Hypo Real Estate said the purpose of the transfer was to
reduce its need for external funds, which it has relied on since
2008, and to benefit from future capital adequacy relief due to
the lower level of total assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
