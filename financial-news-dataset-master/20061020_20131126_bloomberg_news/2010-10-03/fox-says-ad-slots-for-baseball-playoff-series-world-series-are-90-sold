Rates for commercial spots during
Major League Baseball’s postseason on Fox are up 8 percent from
last year, with about 90 percent of the ads sold before the
first pitch.  News Corp. ’s is Fox 25 percent to 30 percent ahead of ad
sales in 2008 if it stays on the current pace, and double where
it stood a year ago, when the economy slowed advance
commitments, the Los Angeles-based network said in an e-mailed
statement.  Fox advertisers including  General Motors Co. ’s Chevrolet
and Anheuser-Busch, as well as telephone, restaurant and
financial-service companies, have made commitments that
underscore the rebound in network advertising. Spending by
marketers on network TV increased 7.2 percent in the first half
of 2010, New York-based Kantar Media said last month.  Fox is charging $225,000 for a half-minute ad in the
playoffs and $450,000 for 30 seconds during the World Series,
according to a network executive, who asked for anonymity
because the numbers aren’t public.  Fox will air the National League Championship Series and
World Series. The NLCS, part of the second round of  postseason
playoffs , is scheduled to start Oct. 16, with the World Series
beginning Oct. 27.  News Corp., the New York-based owner of the Wall Street
Journal, fell 29 cents to $12.95 at 11:19 a.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The Class A shares had declined 3.3
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
