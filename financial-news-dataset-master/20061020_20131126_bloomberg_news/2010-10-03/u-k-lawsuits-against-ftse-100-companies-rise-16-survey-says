U.K. lawsuits against the country’s
100 biggest companies increased 16 percent in a year, suggesting
an “inevitable flood” of litigation from the financial crisis
hasn’t peaked, a legal publisher said.  Cases against FTSE 100-listed companies in the High Court
in London rose to 179 from 154 in the year ended June 30, the
publisher  Sweet & Maxwell  said today in a statement.  Combined lawsuits against  HSBC Holdings Plc ,  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  and  Barclays Plc 
fell 6 percent, and comprised 43 percent of the FTSE 100 cases,
 Sweet & Maxwell  said. Financial services companies make up 18
percent of the FTSE 100, Sweet & Maxwell said.  “Banks are likely to feature frequently in hard-fought
litigation by virtue of the huge volume of complex financial
transactions that they are involved with,” said Sweet &
Maxwell, a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters Corp.  Lawsuits against FTSE 100 companies weren’t the only ones
to increase. Cases to shield corporate secrets more than
 quadrupled  in London last year and trademark cases rose 20
percent, the U.K.  Ministry of Justice  said last month.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Thomson Reuters in selling financial and legal information and
trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
