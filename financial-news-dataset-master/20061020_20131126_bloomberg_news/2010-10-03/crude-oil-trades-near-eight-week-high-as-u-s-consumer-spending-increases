Oil dropped to near $81 a barrel as
traders bet that crude’s rally to an eight-week high had left
prices too expensive amid concern the U.S. economic recovery may
be slowing.  Crude fell for the first time in four days before a report
that may show manufacturing in the U.S., the world’s biggest
oil-consuming nation, slowed in August. Prices also dropped as
the dollar advanced against the euro, damping the investment
appeal of commodities. Oil’s 14-day relative strength index rose
to the highest level since April on Oct. 1, a sign that prices
may have risen too far, too fast.  “The U.S. factory orders and durable goods data out later
may spark off further selling,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior
broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. in London. “There is some
profit taking after the rally.”  Crude for November delivery fell as much as 81 cents, or 1
percent, to $80.77 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $81.15 at 12:04 p.m. London
time. Brent crude for November settlement traded at $83.35 a
barrel, down 40 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  The dollar strengthened from a six-month low against the
euro as sovereign-debt concerns reduced demand for European
assets. The 16-nation euro slipped 0.7 percent to $1.3697, after
rising to $1.3807, the highest level since March 17.  Factory Orders  Orders placed with U.S. factories dropped 0.4 percent in
August, the third decline in four months, according to the
median estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Manufacturing last year led the U.S. out of its worst recession
since the 1930s.  Oil surged $1.61 a barrel, or 2 percent, to $81.58 on Oct.
1 in New York, the highest settlement since Aug. 5, capping the
biggest weekly gain since February.  Following that rally, crude’s 14-day relative strength
index, a measure of how fast prices have risen or fallen in that
period, rose to 68.6, the highest level in nearly six months. A
reading of 70 or more can be taken as a sign that a market is
“overbought” and prices may drop.  Oil, which climbed to a 19-month high of $87.15 a barrel on
May 3, has gained about 2 percent this year as signs of economic
improvement in the U.S. and China fanned speculation fuel demand
would grow. The two countries are the world’s largest energy
users.  Oil may rise to the second-highest annual level on record
next year on demand from China, India and Brazil, threatening
the recovery in developed countries. West Texas Intermediate
crude, the U.S. benchmark grade, will average $85 a barrel in
2011, compared with $77.70 this year, according to the median of
23 analyst forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey, the highest
price for any year except for $99.75 in 2008.  Money managers including hedge funds and other speculators
increased their  net-long positions  in New York crude futures by
10,583, or 10 percent, to 116,906 contracts, according to data
from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  -- With assistance from  Yee Kai Pin  in Singapore. Editors:  Raj Rajendran ,  Mike Anderson .  To contact the reporters on this story:
