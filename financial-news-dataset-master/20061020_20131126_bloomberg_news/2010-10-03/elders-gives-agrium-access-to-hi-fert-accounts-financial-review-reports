Elders Ltd. has given Agrium Inc.
access to the accounts of its Hi-Fert fertilizer business, a
joint venture with AWB Ltd., the Australian Financial
Review reported, without saying where it got the information.  Agrium may not make a decision about buying Elders’ share
of the joint venture until it completes its takeover of AWB,
which is expected next month, the newspaper said. Hi-Fert has
been for sale for more than 18 months, it said.  Elders’ Hi-Fert stake has a book value of A$10.6 million,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
