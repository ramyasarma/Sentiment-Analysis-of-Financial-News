Agrium Inc. ’s A$1.2 billion ($1.2
billion) bid for  AWB Ltd. , Australia’s largest wheat exporter
and No. 2 rural services supplier, was approved by Australia’s
Foreign Investment Review Board.  The board advised Calgary-based Agrium that it had no
objections to the planned purchase under the terms of
Australia’s foreign investment policy, AWB said in a statement
to the Australian stock exchange today.  Purchasing AWB will enable Agrium, North America’s third-
largest fertilizer producer by market value, to broaden sales of
farm products into Australia, the fourth-largest wheat exporter.
BHP Billiton Ltd. has bid $40 billion for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., as forecasts for rising food consumption
boost demand for fertilizer and agricultural assets.  Agrium’s A$1.50-a-share cash bid remains subject to
approval by shareholders of Melbourne-based AWB. The board on
Aug. 24 recommended the bid in the absence of a superior offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
