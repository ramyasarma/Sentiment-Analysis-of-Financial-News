Zain shares jumped to the highest in
six months after Emirates Telecommunications Corp. offered to
buy 46 percent of Kuwait’s largest mobile-phone company.  The shares rose 2.9 percent to 1,400 fils, the highest
intraday level since April 5, at 10:43 a.m. in Kuwait City. The
shares were halted from trading on Sept. 30.  Etisalat, as Emirates Telecommunications is known, said on
Sept. 30 it offered 1.7 Kuwaiti dinars ($5.98) to buy the stake
in Zain. The deal would give Etisalat majority control of Zain
and extend its reach in the Middle East, where Zain operates in
countries from Kuwait and Iraq to Bahrain after selling most of
its African assets this year to Indian billionaire Sunil
Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. for $9 billion.  Kuwait’s Kharafi Group is inviting small shareholders in
Mobile Telecommunications Co., known as Zain, to join in the
stake sale, according to an advertisement in Al-Qabas today. The
advertisement by National Investments Co., which is controlled
by the Kharafi Group, addresses shareholders who own no more
than 300,000 Zain shares.  The Kharafi Group is the second-largest shareholder in
Zain, with about 13 percent. Kuwait Investment  Authority, the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, is Zain’s largest shareholder
with 24.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
