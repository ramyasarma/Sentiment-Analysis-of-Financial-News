Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s
largest carmaker, expects to exceed its target of 670,000
vehicle sales in China this year, thanks to the popularity of
new models, the company said today.  The introduction of Hyundai’s ix35 sport-utility vehicles
and Verna subcompact cars this year helped the company sell
73,122 vehicles in China in September, the highest monthly total
since it entered the local market in 2002, the Seoul-based
automaker said in an e-mailed statement.  Hyundai is boosting production in  China  to meet growing
demand in the world’s largest vehicle market. The carmaker’s
third plant in Beijing, scheduled to open in 2012, will increase
the company’s annual output capacity in the nation by 400,000
vehicles to 1 million, according to the statement.  The automaker sold 510,500 vehicles in China in the first
nine months of 2010, or almost 90 percent of the 570,311 cars it
sold in all of 2009, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
