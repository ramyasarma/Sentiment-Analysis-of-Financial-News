Lee Westwood and Luke Donald routed
Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker to give Europe the first point on
day three of Ryder Cup in Wales.  Westwood and Donald won by 6 holes with 5 remaining, or 6
and 5, in the foursome, or alternate shot, match at Celtic
Manor. The U.S. leads Europe 6-5 with five matches in progress.  It was the worst Ryder Cup defeat ever for Woods, who was
beaten by Westwood for the sixth time in seven Ryder Cup
matches. Woods’s previous worst defeat came in 1997 when he and
Mark O’Meara lost 5 and 3 by Europe captain Colin Montgomerie
and Bernhard Langer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
