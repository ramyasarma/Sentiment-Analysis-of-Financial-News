Sin-Tang Development Pte Ltd. may be
preparing an alternative proposal for Sphere Minerals Ltd., the
subject of a takeover bid by Xstrata Plc., the Australian
Financial Review reported, without saying where it got the 
information.  Representatives of Sin-Tang met with representatives from
Qatar Steel Co., one of Sphere’s largest shareholders, last week
to win its support, the newspaper said. Sin-Tang last week said
it had acquired an 8.6 percent stake in Sphere, the newspaper
said.  Sphere’s directors have endorsed Xstrata’s A$2.50 per share
cash offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
