The New York Yankees lost to the
Boston Red Sox 8-4 in their regular-season finale and will enter
the Major League Baseball postseason with a wild-card berth.  The Yankees needed to win and have the Tampa Bay Rays lose
today to take the American League East title and home-field
advantage in the first round of the playoffs. With the loss, the
Yankees, the defending World Series champions, get the wild card
that goes to the second-place team with the best record and will
open the postseason on the road against the Minnesota Twins on
Oct. 6.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
