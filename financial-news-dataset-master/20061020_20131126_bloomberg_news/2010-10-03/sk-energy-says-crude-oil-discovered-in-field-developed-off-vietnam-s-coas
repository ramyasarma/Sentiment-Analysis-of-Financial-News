SK Energy Co. , South Korea’s largest
oil refiner, said a group of companies of which it is a part
discovered crude oil at a field off Vietnam.  Drilling at the second well of the 15-1/05 block produced
about 3,500 barrels of oil a day, the Seoul-based refiner said
in an e-mailed statement today.  SK Energy bought a 25 percent stake in the project in 2007.
 Total SA  owns 35 percent and PetroVietnam Exploration and
Production Corp. the rest. SK Energy has another block in
Vietnam that started output in 2008.  SK Energy, which is participating in 31 projects in 16
countries to secure 500 million barrels of oil, produces 60,000
barrels of crude a day, according to the company.  The oil refiner fell 1 percent to close at 144,000 won in
Seoul on Oct. 1, compared with the 0.2 percent gain in the
benchmark  Kospi index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
