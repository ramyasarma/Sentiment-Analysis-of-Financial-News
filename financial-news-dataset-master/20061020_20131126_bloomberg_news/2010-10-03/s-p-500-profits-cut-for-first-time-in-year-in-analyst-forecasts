For the first time in more than a
year analysts are cutting their forecasts for Standard & Poor’s
500 Index earnings, jeopardizing gains from the biggest
September rally since World War II.  Estimates for S&P 500 companies’ combined 2011  profit  fell
as low as $95.17 last month from an August high of $96.16 and
posted the first quarterly reduction since the three months
ended June 2009, according to more than 8,500 analyst forecasts
tracked by Bloomberg. The revision came as the  benchmark  gauge
for U.S. equities rose 8.8 percent last month, the largest
September advance since 1939.  Now, money managers at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and USAA
Investment Management Co. are preparing for weaker returns in
October as  Alcoa Inc. ’s Oct. 7 report starts the third-quarter
earnings season. Bulls say even with the decline in analyst
estimates, equities remain cheaper based on  forecast  profits
than at any time since 1988, excluding the six months after
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy in 2008.  “Earnings forecasts are going to be somewhat more muted in
their expectations for future growth,” said  Chad Morganlander ,
a Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel
Nicolaus, which oversees $90 billion. “It’s not necessarily a
bad thing, but it’s certainly not the fuel that will reignite
animal spirits.”  U.K., Hong Kong  Analysts cut 2011 profit estimates for benchmark stock
indexes in 20 of the world’s 24 developed markets last month as
U.S.  unemployment  remains near the highest in 27 years and
European lawmakers enact austerity measures to shrink budget
deficits. Income forecasts for the  FTSE 100 Index  of U.K.
companies have fallen 4.9 percent since the end of May, while
those in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index are down 1.5 percent since
February, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Estimates show S&P 500 earnings may rise 15 percent in
2011, down from a forecast of 20 percent growth in March,
Bloomberg data show. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 1,146.24
last week amid lingering concern that Europe’s government debt
crisis may threaten the economic recovery.  The stock index lost 0.8 percent to 1,137.03 at 4 p.m. New
York time today. The average analyst estimate for S&P 500 profit
in 2011 has rebounded to $95.95 a share, Bloomberg data show.  Alcoa, the first of 30 companies in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average to report third-quarter results,  may say on
Oct. 7  that it earned 6 cents a share in the past three months,
according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s 77 percent less than the 28-cent projection in March for
the New York-based aluminum producer.  ‘Pretty Fancy’  Companies in the S&P 500 may report profits rose 23 percent
on average during the third quarter, according to forecasts
tracked by Bloomberg. That’s about half the 49 percent growth
during the second quarter and the 52 percent  increase  from
January through March.  “You need pretty fancy GDP numbers to get to $95 a share
in earnings next year,” said  Robert Doll , vice chairman of New
York-based BlackRock Inc., which oversees $3.2 trillion. “Our
view is that they’re still a little too high, and that nobody
believes them.”  Evidence of slowing global growth has led economists to
reduce forecasts for U.S. gross domestic product to 2.5 percent
in 2010, down from 3.1 percent in May, according to monthly
Bloomberg surveys. The world’s largest economy expanded at an
annual rate of 5 percent during the fourth quarter of 2009, the
most in almost four years. It slowed to 1.7 percent in the
second quarter, the Commerce Department said Sept. 30.  Strategists’ Estimates  Equity strategists that follow broad market and economic
trends are less optimistic on the prospects for earnings next
year than company analysts. S&P 500 profits may total $87.34 a
share in 2011, according to the average of 11 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Bank of America Corp.’s  David Bianco  cut his year-end
estimate for the S&P 500 to 1,250 from 1,300 on Sept. 22, citing
concern the U.S. Congress isn’t likely to extend tax cuts on
dividends and capital gains that were enacted during  George W. Bush ’s presidency. The chief U.S. equity strategist for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender predicts S&P 500
companies will earn a total of $90 a share in 2011.  “If analysts are lowering estimates on a broad basis, the
market should reflect that,” said  Wasif Latif , vice president
of equity investments at USAA, which oversees $45 billion in San
Antonio. Part of the reason companies beat profit forecasts in
prior quarters was because they reduced expenses, he added.
“You can only cut costs so much before you start cutting into
bone,” Latif said.  Longest Streak  More than 70 percent of S&P 500 companies have exceeded the
average analyst profit projection for four straight quarters,
the  longest streak  in Bloomberg data going back to 1993.  Changes in earnings projections have historically been
correlated with swings in U.S. share prices. The S&P 500 climbed
to an all-time high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007, and profit
projections for the next year peaked about three months later.
After the index slumped to a 12-year low in March 2009, the
forecasts bottomed out in the following two months, data tracked
by Bloomberg show.  While estimates for U.S. corporate profit fell last
quarter, they still indicate that firms in the S&P 500 will
report  record  earnings in 2011. The equity benchmark is  valued 
at 12 times projected income for 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the cheapest level since 1988,
excluding October 2008 to March 2009 after New York-based
Lehman’s bankruptcy, relative to reported profit from the past
12 months.  ‘Equities Are Cheap’  Michael Levine  of OppenheimerFunds Inc. says the outlook
for lower earnings is already reflected in stock prices after
the S&P 500 fell as much as  16 percent  between April 23 and July
2. He predicts equity prices will keep rising as investors grow
more confident that the U.S. economy isn’t headed for the second
 recession  in three years.  “Equities are cheap,” said Levine, a money manager at New
York-based OppenheimerFunds, which oversees about $165 billion.
“The broader markets are assuming there’s a slow but gradual
recovery. As long as that’s the message, the markets will be
fine.”  Marshall & Ilsley Corp.  and Vulcan Materials Co. had the
biggest reductions in profit estimates for 2011 among S&P 500
companies since June 30.  Marshall & Ilsley, Vulcan  While the projection for Marshall & Ilsley was cut 87
percent since June, the average indicates the Milwaukee-based
regional bank will post the biggest jump in earnings -- 102
percent -- since at least 2000 next year. Vulcan Materials, a
Birmingham, Alabama-based producer of asphalt and concrete, may
 grow income  by 207 percent, the most in at least a decade,
analysts say. Its per-share earnings forecast for 2011 was cut
by 75 percent in the past seven months.  Analysts reduced  2011 profit estimates  for New York-based
Verizon Communications Inc. by 4.5 percent in the past three
months to $2.29 a share, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. While  shares  of the second-largest U.S. phone company
have soared 24 percent, the biggest quarterly advance since
2002, projections show income may fall 8 percent this year and
rise 4 percent the next.  Forecasts for West Chester, Ohio-based AK Steel Holding
Corp.’s income next year dropped 27 percent between July and
September to $1.27 a share, data tracked by Bloomberg show. The
jump in earnings next year from an estimated 7 cents a share in
2010 would be the biggest since at least 2000. The third-largest
U.S. steelmaker by sales predicted an  operating loss  for the
third quarter on Sept. 15 after iron-ore prices increased.  “Stocks go up and they raise their earnings estimates, the
markets go down they start reducing estimates -- a lot of it has
to do with the psychology,” said  Jeff Saut , chief investment
strategist at Raymond James & Associates, which manages $235
billion in St. Petersburg, Florida. “Over the long run,
investing is indeed all about the earnings, but over the short
term it’s all about psychology.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
