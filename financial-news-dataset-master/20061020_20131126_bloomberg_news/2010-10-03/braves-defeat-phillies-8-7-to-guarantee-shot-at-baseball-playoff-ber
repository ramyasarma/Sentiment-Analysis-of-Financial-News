The Atlanta Braves assured themselves
of at least a spot in a playoff for a Major League Baseball
postseason berth by beating the Philadelphia Phillies 8-7.  The Braves finished 91-71 with the win in Atlanta on the
final day of the regular season, second in the National League
East behind the Phillies.   If the San Francisco Giants beat the San Diego Padres this
afternoon to take the NL West title, the Braves will be in the
postseason as a wild card, which goes to the second-place team
with the best record. If the Padres win, they would tie the
Giants at 91-71 and would play San Francisco in a one-game
playoff tomorrow for the NL West title. The loser then would
play the Braves the following day in Atlanta for the wild-card
spot.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
