Syrian President  Bashar al-Assad 
formed a company to guide investment at home and abroad while
transforming the country’s financial markets and infrastructure,
the  Syrian Arab News Agency  said.  Assad signed a decree creating a state holding company with
5 billion pounds ($108 million) of capital and a mandate to form
a sovereign wealth fund, the state news service cited Finance
Minister  Mohammad al-Hussein  as saying.  The new company will guide investments and oversee the
creation of joint ventures between foreign and domestic
companies, SANA said. It’s also tasked with setting up banks,
insurance companies and other financial institutions.  “The state will become an important player in investment
markets,” Hussein was cited as saying.  Syria aims to attract as much as $55 billion in foreign
direct investment over the next five years, with almost half of
that earmarked for infrastructure projects, Deputy Prime
Minister for Economic Affairs  Abdallah Dardari  said Sept. 24.  Syria is encouraging the development of private businesses
in its state-dominated economy, opening the country’s first
stock exchange in 2009. The International Monetary Fund has
urged Syria to quicken its transition to a market-based economy
while reducing its dependence on the oil industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
