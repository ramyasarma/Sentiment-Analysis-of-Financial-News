---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES

1,146.24 last week, halting four straight weeks of gains.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 30.58 points for the
week, or 0.3 percent, to 10,829.68.  London: European stocks fell after a report showed growth in U.S.
manufacturing slowed in September, prompting speculation that
last month’s rally in equities has overshot the prospects for
economic growth.
*Banco Santander SA retreated after European Union officials
warned that the fallout from the debt crisis  could hurt
Europe’s lenders.

Nick Hayek Jr. said the weakness of the dollar is hurting profit.

258.95 at 3:47 p.m. in London, extending its biggest weekly drop
in three months.  Tokyo: Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed, led by property
developers as housing starts rose for a third month. Shipping
lines declined after an index of cargo rates dropped.

“unacceptable” and that more monetary easing is probably
needed to spur growth and avert deflation.
