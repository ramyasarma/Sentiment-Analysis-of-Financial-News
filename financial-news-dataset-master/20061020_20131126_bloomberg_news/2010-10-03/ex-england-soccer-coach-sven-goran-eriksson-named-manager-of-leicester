Former England and Mexico soccer
manager  Sven-Goran Eriksson  was named manager of English second-
division club Leicester City.  Eriksson, 62, will start work immediately and travel with
the team on a tour of Vietnam, the club said today in a
statement on its website.  The Swede replaces Paulo Sousa, who was dismissed two days
ago after the Foxes slid to the foot of the Championship.
Following yesterday’s 3-1 home win over Scunthorpe, the second
league victory of the season, the team is two places off the
bottom with eight points from 10 games.  “The ambition of the club attracted me,” Eriksson told
reporters today. “I met the chairman and the owners a couple of
days ago and they explained to me what they wanted to do. I want
to manage in the Premier League again, that’s why I’m here.”  Eriksson led the Ivory Coast at this year’s World Cup,
where it failed to progress beyond the group stage.  He won league titles with Benfica in Portugal and Lazio in
Italy, and the UEFA Cup with Sweden’s Gothenburg. His managerial
career also includes spells with Manchester City, Sampdoria and
Roma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
