             Swiss  stocks  fell after the  Federal
Reserve  said it would take away most emergency measures.  
 Fifteen of 20 stocks on the Swiss Market Index dropped as
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank by market
value, declined 2.8 percent and UBS AG, the largest lender by
assets, retreated 2.3 percent.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  fell 1.9
percent.  
 The Swiss Market Index of the biggest and most actively
traded companies fell 43.09, or 0.7 percent, to 6,489.23 in
Zurich. The benchmark index for Swiss equities has rallied 51
percent from this year’s March 9 low as central banks cut
interest rates and governments worldwide committed about $12
trillion to revive the economy. The broader  Swiss Performance
Index (SPI)  declined 0.7 to 5,571.12 today.  
 The Fed, after concluding a two-day meeting yesterday, said
most of its lending programs would expire as scheduled Feb. 1
because of “improvements in the functioning of financial
markets.” Policy makers said the labor market is stabilizing,
yet kept a pledge to keep  interest rates  “exceptionally low”
for an “extended period.”  
 Swiss investor confidence fell for a second month on
concern about the pace of the economic recovery. An index of
investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict
economic developments in the six months ahead, slipped to 54
from 56.4 in November, the ZEW Center for European  Economic
Research  and Credit Suisse said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 “The market has not been able to break out of its trading
range and with the dollar now significantly strengthening,
people are taking money off the table,” said Lex van Dam,  fund
manager  at London-based Hampstead Capital, which oversees $500
million.  
 UBS fell 2.3 percent to 16.21 francs, and Swiss Life fell
1.9 percent to 131 francs. It sold shares in  Germany ’s MLP AG to
Barmenia Krankenversicherung, reducing its stake to 9.9 percent
from 15.9 percent.  
 Credit Suisse fell 2.8 percent to 51.30 francs. Yesterday,
the bank agreed to pay $536 million to settle claims it helped
process payments that let Iran and other nations avoid
government sanctions and gain access to U.S. financial markets.  
 Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the Swiss private banking group,
slid 1.2 percent to 34.27 francs.  
 Synthes Inc. the world’s largest maker of devices to mend
broken and malformed bones, fell 1 percent to 136.10 francs, its
first fall in four days.  
 Cham Paper Holding AG (CPGN) , the Swiss specialty paper maker that
supplies Nestle SA and Philip Morris International Inc., rose
4.5 percent to 192.50 francs, rising for the second day.  
 Kudelski SA (KUD)  increased 5.7 percent to 22.68 francs. The
world’s largest maker of security cards for  pay television  was
raised to “buy” from “hold” at Vontobel.
