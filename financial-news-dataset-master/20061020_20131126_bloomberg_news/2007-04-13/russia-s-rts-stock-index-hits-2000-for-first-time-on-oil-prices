             Russia 's benchmark  RTS (RTSI$)  Index
surpassed the 2000 mark for the first time after surging crude
prices increased demand for energy stocks in the world's biggest
oil-producing nation.  
 OAO Rosneft and OAO Lukoil led gains. Oil traded close to
$64 a barrel in New York today after jumping the most in two
weeks yesterday on a report showing world supplies fell last
month. Crude has gained 27 percent since its low in January.  
 The  RTS , dominated by oil and gas companies, has doubled
over the past 17 months. Higher commodities prices, and President
 Vladimir Putin 's success in improving tax collection and
increasing control over the  energy industry , are helping the
economy expand for a ninth year since the government's 1998 debt
default and ruble devaluation.  
 ``It's not surprising that Russia has delivered this kind of
return, given the strength of the underlying economy, commodity
prices and overall positive sentiment on global  emerging
markets ,'' said Aivaras Abromavicius, who helps oversee $3.8
billion in Russia equities at East Capital in Moscow.  
 Emerging-market stocks rallied globally today. The Morgan
Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index added 0.6
percent to a record 969.36 as of 5:11 p.m. in London. The measure
has climbed 15 percent since touching a low for the year on March 5.  
 Russia's banking stocks have contributed about 294  index (MXEF) 
points to the RTS's gain in the last 17 months, according to
Alexei Zabotkin, chief strategist at Deutsche Bank's Moscow
brokerage unit. The estimate was based on a calculation he made
as the RTS approached 2000. Oil and gas, which dominate the RTS
and make up 68 percent of Russia's export revenue, contributed
284 index points to the 1000-point gain.  
 Lukoil, Sberbank  
 The RTS added 1.8 percent to 2001.59 today. As of yesterday,
Russia's stock market was worth about $1.1 trillion.  
 Shares of OAO Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, have
risen 52 percent since Nov. 17, 2005.  Sberbank (SBER) , Russia's biggest
bank, and OAO Unified Energy System, the country's national
electricity company, more than tripled in the period.  
 ``Energy stocks have substantially underperformed in this
period,'' said  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at  Alfa Bank  in
Moscow. Sberbank benefited from the economy's commodity-driven
boom, while Unified Energy has risen on the government's plan to
split up the electricity industry into more competitive
generation, distribution and sales companies, he said.  
 Rosneft climbed 5.2 percent to 229.28 rubles today on the
Micex Stock Exchange, while Lukoil added 0.9 percent to 2,194.62.  
 Oil Prices  
 Oil prices  surged in New York yesterday after the close of
Russian stock markets, with crude for May delivery jumping 3
percent to $63.85 a barrel. The contract added 17 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $64.02 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today.  
 Revenue from highly taxed oil and gas exports has flooded
the broader Russian economy, boosting earnings in industries
ranging from telecommunications to beer.  
 The economy will probably expand 6.2 percent this year,
compared with 6.8 percent in 2006. Budget revenue from oil and
gas will account for about 8.2 percent of gross domestic product,
or 2.5 trillion rubles ($97 billion) this year, Russian Finance
Minister  Alexei Kudrin  has said. Oil and gas revenue accounted
for 11.7 percent of GDP last year.  
 Sberbank, the country's biggest bank, rose 3.7 percent to
102,604 rubles today. UBS AG raised its price estimate for the
shares 19 percent to $5,250, citing data from Russia's Central
Bank on growth in loans and bank deposits.  
 X5 Retail  
 Shares of X5 Retail Group NV, Russia's biggest supermarket
chain, also climbed, adding 1.7 percent to $28.50 in London. The
company said it intends to raise $1 billion through a secondary
stock sale for expansion and a possible acquisition of the
Carousel superstore chain.  
 Chief Executive Officer Lev Khasis said March 29 that the
company was considering selling between $1 billion and $2 billion
in stock.  
 ``We view this more limited amount as good news,'' wrote
Odile Lange-Broussy, an analyst at Aton Capital in Moscow, in a
research note today. Lange-Broussy has a ``buy'' recommendation
on X5 shares and a price estimate of $35.50.
