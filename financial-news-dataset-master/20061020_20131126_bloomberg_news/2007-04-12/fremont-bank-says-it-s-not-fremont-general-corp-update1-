             Fremont Bank is a community
institution in the San Francisco Bay area. Fremont General Corp.,
in  Los Angeles , is selling $4 billion of loans to stem losses
from subprime lending. Please don't confuse them, Fremont Bank
says.  
 The bank issued a statement today disavowing any
relationship with the its neighbor to the south, insisting its
rigorous lending procedures have nothing in common with Fremont
General's subprime loans, which U.S. regulators ordered an end
to.  
 ``We've had CPA's that are our clients call up and say `Hey,
my client has a mortgage and they're concerned; what's going on
with your company?''' Fremont Bank spokeswoman Kimberly Brokaw
said in an interview. ``And I say, `That's not us!' It really has
been a confusion.''  
 Fremont Bank, which has 24 branches, has been in business
for over 40 years and is very well capitalized, strong and
``absolutely not'' associated with Fremont General, Brokaw said.  
 ``It's on the Web. It's crazy. It's funny, it's calming
down. I think it's going to go away as the news about Fremont
General goes away,'' Brokaw said. ``We've made our name as a very
prudent lender. We're a solid bank.''
