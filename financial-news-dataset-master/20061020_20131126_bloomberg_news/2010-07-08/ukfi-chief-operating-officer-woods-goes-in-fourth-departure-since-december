             Sam Woods , the chief operating
officer at U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., which oversees the
government’s bank stakes, is to step down, making him the fourth
person to leave the organization in the past seven months.  
 Woods is now working as secretary to the government-
appointed commission into whether retail and investment banking
should be separated in the U.K., he said in a telephone
interview today. He refused to comment further.  
 Tim Sykes , who was head of market-investment strategy at
UKFI, said he was leaving in May shortly after the coalition
government took office. A government sale of its 83 percent
stake in  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and its 41 percent
holding in  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  is at least 12 months to 18
months away, Treasury Minister  Mark Hoban  told the Guardian in
an  interview  last month.  
 UKFI also manages the U.K. Treasury’s holding in Northern
Rock Plc, the first British lender to be rescued following the
advent of the financial crisis in 2007.  
 John Kingman , the former chief executive officer at UKFI,
stood down in December, while  John Crompton , head of markets
strategy, resigned in January and is now working at HSBC
Holdings Plc as global head of equity capital markets.  
 Woods joined UKFI at the height of the financial crisis in
November 2008 and helped craft bonus policy, having previously
held posts at the Treasury and prior to that at Diaego Plc.
