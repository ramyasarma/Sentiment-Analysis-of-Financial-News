             China’s government faces pressure to
curb “abnormal” amounts of capital from flowing into the
country, causing inflation, the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said today in a statement.  
 The pressure of net foreign-exchange inflow eased in May
because of a declining expectation that the Chinese yuan would
gain, the currency regulator said in its statement. A stronger
value in the U.S. dollar also contributed to the decline in
capital inflows, the regulator said.
