             Mexico sold 850 million euros ($1.08
billion) of seven-year bonds in the country’s first European
offering since 2005.  
 The notes yield 180 basis points more than the benchmark
mid-swap rate, according to Bloomberg data. Barclays Capital,
BNP Paribas SA and Deutsche Bank AG managed the sale. Mexico
last sold debt in euros in June 2005.  
 “There are opportunities in the European markets,”
Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said in London today.  
 The government is also considering selling bonds in yen,
 Gerardo Rodriguez , head of public debt at the finance ministry,
said in an interview last week. Citigroup Inc. said it will add
Mexican bonds to its World Government Bond Index in October,
pushing yields on local debt to a record low.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 5.5 percent euro bond due in 2020
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.799
percent. The price of the security rose 0.26 euro cents to
105.26 euro cents on the euro.  
 “It seems that the window to sell Mexican bonds is wide
open and will help push the rally in bonds,” said  Gabriel Casillas , chief Mexico economist for JPMorgan Chase & Co.
“Mexico was criticized harshly last year, including by Nobel
prize winners, for its fiscal reform. It’s now paying off.”  
 Mexico raised taxes last year to close the widest budget
deficit in about 20 years. Nobel Prize-winner  Joseph Stiglitz 
said last year the Mexican government’s measures to deal with
the global financial crisis was one of the worst in the world.
