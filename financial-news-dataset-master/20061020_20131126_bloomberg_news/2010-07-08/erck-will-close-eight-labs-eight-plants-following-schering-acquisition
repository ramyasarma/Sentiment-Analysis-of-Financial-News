             Merck & Co.  will close eight research
labs and eight manufacturing plants as part of a previously
announced plan to reduce operations following the  acquisition  of
Schering-Plough Corp. last year.  
 The drugmaker will shut research labs in Canada, Denmark,
the Netherlands, Germany, Scotland and Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Merck said today in a statement. The company will close
manufacturing operations in Italy, Portugal, Mexico, Brazil, and
Singapore, and sell plants in Miami Lakes, Florida and
Argentina.  
 The cuts are part of a plan to eliminate 15 percent of the
combined company’s workforce, or about 15,000 jobs, following
the acquisition. Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck is
aiming to eliminate $3.5 billion in annual costs by 2012.
Following the site closings, Merck will have 16 major research
facilities and 77 manufacturing plants.  
 Merck rose 43 cents to $35.86 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
