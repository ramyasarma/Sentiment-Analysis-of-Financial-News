             San Francisco is the sole U.S.
candidate city to host the 34th edition of sailing’s America’s
Cup, the Golden Gate Yacht Club said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The city is home to club, whose BMW Oracle Racing team won
the 33rd America’s Cup in Valencia, Spain, in February.  
 Expressions of interest from four European countries are
also being studied by the defending team, the club added. A
final decision on the venue and the dates of the next edition,
which is scheduled for 2013 or 2014, will be made by the end of
the year.
