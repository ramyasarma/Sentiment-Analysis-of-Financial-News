             Former Credit Agricole SA Chief
Executive Officer Georges Pauget recommends in a report to be
given today to French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde that
the country’s banks should cut charges to retail clients for
refusing payments, Les Echos said.  
 The change would cost banks tens of millions of euros in
commissions each year, Les Echos said. The newspaper cited a
copy of the report, prepared by Pauget with Emmanuel Constans,
head of the CCSF consultative committee on the financial
industry.
