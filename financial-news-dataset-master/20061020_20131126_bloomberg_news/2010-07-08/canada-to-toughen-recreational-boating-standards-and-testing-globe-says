             The Canadian government will change
the way it licenses recreational boat operators, including
tougher testing standards, the Globe and Mail reported, citing
Transport Canada.  
 Boaters can currently obtain licenses by taking a 36-
question test online, the newspaper said. New protocol would
require applicants to review a study guide before taking a 50-
question test so they can demonstrate they’ve read and
understand the material.  
 The new standards will take effect in September, the Globe
said.
