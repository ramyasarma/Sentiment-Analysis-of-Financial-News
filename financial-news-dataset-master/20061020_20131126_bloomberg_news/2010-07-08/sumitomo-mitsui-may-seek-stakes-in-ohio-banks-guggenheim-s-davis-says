             Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. ,
the Japanese bank looking to buy a stake in a U.S. lender, may
consider Ohio’s Huntington Bancshares Inc., KeyCorp or Fifth
Third Bancorp as potential targets, said  Jeff Davis , an analyst
at Guggenheim Securities LLC.  
 Banks that are weak or nominally profitable would be more
willing to sell a stake, Davis said today in an interview.
Columbus-based  Huntington , Cleveland’s KeyCorp and  Fifth Third ,
with its headquarters in Cincinnati, are among banks that have
yet to repay aid from the U.S. Treasury Department’s bank-
bailout program. Dallas-based  Comerica Inc. , which repaid $2.25
billion in rescue funds, may also be a candidate, Davis said.  
 “Probably the ideal target would be one that needs
additional capital, because they’re more likely to say yes,”
said Davis, who predicted in July 2008 that the U.S. would
experience a “couple hundred” bank failures. Regulators have
closed more than [bn:URL= http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html   
 http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html ] 240 banks [] since then.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan’s second-largest bank by market
value, may spend as much as $5 billion for a stake in a U.S.
commercial lender in the next three years,  Hiroshi Minoura , head
of international banking at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., said
in a July 7 interview. The company is studying about 20 U.S.
banks, Minoura said.  
 “We can’t overlook the U.S. market in terms of stable
returns and size,” he said. “We need to push forward with
investments, including acquisitions, that allow us to capture a
large volume of assets.”  
 KeyCorp Capital  
 The capital position of KeyCorp is “fine,” and executives
have denied as recently as this week that it wants to be a
takeover target, Guggenheim’s Davis said. Still, lenders
including KeyCorp may struggle without a “sustained and very
robust” economic recovery in the U.S.  
 “They may be nominally profitable, but from a shareholder
perspective they need to sell,” he said.  
 William Murschel , a spokesman for KeyCorp, declined to
comment. Maureen Brown, a spokeswoman for Huntington, and  Debra DeCourcy  of Fifth Third didn’t immediately respond to messages
seeking comment.  
 An acquisition in the world’s largest economy would support
Sumitomo Mitsui President  Teisuke Kitayama ’s goal of getting 30
percent of banking profit from clients  overseas  within three
years, up from 20 percent last fiscal year. The Tokyo-based bank
agreed to invest in India’s  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.  last month.  
 Minoura said Sumitomo Mitsui won’t be able to meet its
overseas profit target “organically” through growth of its
existing businesses outside Japan. He said he’ll probably target
banks in the U.S. Midwest or East Coast, declining to name any
companies.  
 Japan’s Deflation  
 “A takeover certainly makes sense from Sumitomo’s
perspective,” Davis said. “Japan has been, for 20 or more
years, in a deflationary environment. The U.S. would be a
natural outlet, but we may be in our own early days of a
deflationary, deleveraging cycle.”  
 Sumitomo Mitsui has raised 1.8 trillion yen ($20 billion)
in two  stock sales  since June 2009 to replenish capital. Though
the bank isn’t in any detailed talks now, the size of an
investment would probably be $1.5 billion to $5 billion,
depending on the target’s  size , said Minoura, 54. He said the
company would prefer to buy a majority stake, though a minority
investment is also a possibility.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui passed on opportunities to acquire Wachovia
Corp. and Washington Mutual Inc. during the financial crisis,
Minoura said. Wachovia was bought by Wells Fargo & Co. for $12.7
billion in 2008 and Washington Mutual’s banking operations were
sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui returned to profit in the fiscal year ended
March 31 and forecast net income will rise 25 percent to 340
billion yen this fiscal year. That would still be less than half
of what the bank earned in the 12 months through March 2006.
