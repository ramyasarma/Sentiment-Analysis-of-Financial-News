             Dubai shares increased to the highest
level this month, leading gains in Gulf markets, as the
International Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecast,
oil gained and  Drake & Scull International  won a contract.  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  climbed 1.2 percent to 1,499.81,
the highest since June 28, bringing the gain for the week to 2
percent. Drake & Scull increased a fourth time this week.  Emaar
Properties PJSC , developer of the world’s tallest tower, jumped
3.2 percent, pushing Dubai’s real-estate index to the highest
this month. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  added 0.3 percent.  
 An improved global outlook helped boost investor sentiment,
said  Saud Masud , a Dubai-based analyst at UBS AG. “Local
markets are still searching for a catalyst.”  
 The IMF raised its global economic growth forecast for this
year, reflecting a stronger-than-expected first half. The world
economy will expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the biggest gain since
2007, compared with an April projection of 4.2 percent, the
Washington-based fund said late yesterday. The  MSCI World Index 
of developed nations climbed 0.8 percent at 4:43 p.m. in Dubai.  
 The IMF also warned that financial-market turmoil has
increased the risks to the recovery. “Investors should sell
into any strength till the dust clears up a bit both globally
and locally,” Masud said.  
 Crude for August delivery advanced to the highest in a
week, gaining as much as 1.4 percent to $75.10 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The six
nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of
the world’s oil.  
 Drake & Scull  
 Drake & Scull increased 1.8 percent to 81.4 fils, the
highest since June 22. The company won a 460-million dirham
($125 million) contract for works on the Information Technology
and Communications Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  
 Emaar climbed to 3.22 dirhams, the highest since June 27.
The DFM Real Estate Index gained 2.6 percent.  
 Oman’s  MSM30 Index  and Abu Dhabi’s  benchmark index  rose 0.2
percent. The  QE Index  advanced 0.4 percent, Bahrain’s  gauge 
climbed 0.3 percent, while the  Kuwait Stock Exchange Index  fell
0.3 percent. Saudi Arabia’s market was closed for the weekend.
