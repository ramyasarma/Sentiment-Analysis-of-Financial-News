             Chinese domestic iron ore production
likely peaked in 2007,  Lloyd’s List  said, citing a report from
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.  
 Chinese production of the steel-making ingredient fell to
233.7 million metric tons in 2009, from 399.7 million tons in
2007, the newspaper reported.  
 The decrease in China’s domestic production helps to
explain the nation’s increasing imports of the raw material,
Lloyd’s List said.
