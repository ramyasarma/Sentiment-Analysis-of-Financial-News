             Cattle futures rose to a six-week
high on speculation that U.S. meatpackers are paying more for
animals as profit improves. Hogs also gained.  
 Spot-market  steers  sold for about 92 cents a pound
yesterday in Texas, up 1 cent from a  week  earlier, government
data show. Packers are making about $40 per head of cattle
slaughtered, said  David Kruse , the president of CommStock
Investments Inc. in Royal, Iowa. The wholesale price of  choice
beef  fell 0.3 percent at midday after reaching a four-week high
this week.  
 “Packers have had a good ability to maintain margins,
which maintains their interest in killing cattle,” Kruse said.
“This week, it appears that the packers are paying up a little
again, because they can. They have the margin ability to do
so.”  
 Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.4 cent, or 0.4
percent, to 90.9 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price touched 91.225 cents, the highest
level for a most-active contract since May 21. Feeder-cattle
futures for August settlement rose 0.05 cent to $1.136 a pound.  
 Hog futures for August settlement climbed 0.075 cent to
80.9 cents a pound. The price has gained 23 percent this year.  
 Yesterday, meatpackers  shipped  4.6 million pounds (2,087
metric tons) of pork, the most since June 15, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  Wholesale pork  slumped 1.3 percent
yesterday to 80.99 cents a pound, the lowest since April 12.  
 Retailers may be refilling freezers after consumers stepped
up purchases during the U.S. Independence Day holiday, when many
people grill outdoors. Lower wholesale prices may have boosted
demand, Kruse said.  
 Shipments “have been pretty good, although it took lower
prices to make it happen,” Kruse said. “All of the buyers have
been waiting for a bargain before they move. It takes a fire
sale to motivate buyers.”
