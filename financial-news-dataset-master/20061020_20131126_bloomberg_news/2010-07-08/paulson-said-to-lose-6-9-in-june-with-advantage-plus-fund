               John Paulson , the billionaire who has
been betting on a U.S. economic recovery, lost 6.9 percent in
June in his Advantage Plus hedge fund to bring his first-half
decline to 8.8 percent, investors said.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks tumbled
13 percent from the end of April through June 30, hurting
performance. Paulson’s Advantage and Advantage Plus funds were
positioned to profit from a jump in stocks including financial-
services companies, said two clients briefed on the returns, who
asked not to be named because the fund is private.  
 Paulson, who runs the $33 billion New York-based Paulson &
Co., hasn’t changed his bullish views after the stock market’s
decline and last week’s data showing weaker-than-expected
private-sector employment in June, according to the investors.
Almost two-thirds of the firm’s assets are in his Advantage
funds, which invest in corporate events such as bankruptcies and
mergers. The Advantage fund dropped 4.4 percent in June and 5.8
percent in the first half, the investors said.  
   Armel Leslie , a spokesman for the fund firm, declined to
comment.  
 Paulson & Co. raised its stakes in financial companies in
the first quarter by 6.5 percent, according to regulatory
filings.  
   Bank of America Corp ., Paulson’s second-biggest stock
holding after the SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund as of
March 31, has declined 2.2 percent in 2010, including dividends.
The company gained 29 percent this year through mid-April.  
   Citigroup Inc ., his next-largest position, has climbed
18 percent in 2010 after rising 46 percent through April 23,
when the S&P 500 reached this year’s peak.  
 Recovery Fund  
 Paulson’s smaller Recovery Fund, marketed as a purer play
on economic growth, fell 12 percent in June, the investors said.
The fund rose 9 percent in the first half.  
 Paulson, 54, has told clients he expects inflation to
increase over the next three to five years, which is why he has
also been buying gold and mining shares, including  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd . and  Kinross Gold Corp . The firm also offers fund
shares denominated in gold. Gold has risen about 10 percent this
year.  
 Paulson’s Gold Fund climbed 7.3 percent in June and
13 percent for the year, the investors said.
