             Japan’s sales of equipment used to
make semiconductors and flat-panel displays will rise this year
at almost twice the rate projected six months ago, as demand for
memory chips rebounds, an industry group said.  
 Machinery sales will rise 71 percent to 1.61 trillion yen
($18.3 billion) in the 12 months through March 2011 from a year
earlier, the Semiconductor Equipment  Association of Japan 
forecast today in a statement. The group in January estimated
that sales would rise 38 percent in the current fiscal year.  
 Gear makers are benefiting as companies including  Samsung
Electronics Co.  expand factory lines to meet rising demand for
personal-computer memory and chips used to store data in
portable devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  Tokyo Electron
Ltd. , Japan’s biggest maker of chip gear, forecasts it will
return to profit this year on an estimated 58 percent increase
in sales.  
 Revenue from chip-making gear will jump 88 percent to 1.23
trillion yen in the period, while sales of machines that make
flat-panel displays will rise 32 percent to 380 billion yen,
SEAJ said.  
 The rebound in equipment orders follows three years of
declines that reduced bookings to less than half the 2006 peak.
Orders in fiscal 2006 totaled 2.32 trillion yen.
