             Roche Holding AG  failed to win the
initial backing of the U.K.’s health-cost panel for use of its
Avastin medicine in patients whose breast cancer has spread.  
 The  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence’s 
advisory committee found that the cost -- an average of about
26,000 pounds ($39,400) for each patient -- didn’t justify
Avastin’s use as a first-line therapy in combination with
paclitaxel chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast
cancer, NICE said today in an e-mailed statement. While Avastin
kept tumors at bay for five and a half months longer than
chemotherapy alone, the drug only prolonged patients’ lives by
an additional seven weeks, NICE said.  
 Avastin, also called bevacizumab, was Roche’s top-selling
drug during the first quarter, generating  sales  of 1.67 billion
Swiss francs ($1.59 billion). The medicine is approved for
several cancer types, including colorectal, lung and breast
malignancies. Roche is seeking to expand use of the medicine,
the first to choke off the blood supply to tumors, by testing it
in different cancers and earlier in the disease.  
 “Evidence of the length of time bevacizumab could keep the
cancer under control was not robust,” NICE Chief Executive
Officer  Andrew Dillon  said in the  statement . “There was also no
proof that the drug can give patients a better quality of life”
than chemotherapy.  
 NICE  will make a final recommendation on whether the U.K.’s
National Health Service should pay for the medicine after a
consultation period.
