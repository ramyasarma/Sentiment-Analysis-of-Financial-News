             Australia’s Prime Minister Julia
Gillard has backed away from her plan to build a refugee
processing facility in East Timor after the nation condemned the
idea as unworkable, the Australian newspaper reported.  
 Gillard hasn’t committed to the facility being located in
East Timor, the newspaper reported, citing Gillard. East Timor
President Jose Ramos-Horta has discussed the possibility of the
centre in his country, it said, citing an unnamed spokesman.
