             Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans rose relative to
Chicago futures as U.S. farmers withheld supplies and overseas
demand increased.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 80 cents to 95 cents a bushel above August futures,
compared with 80 cents to 90 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn premium rose to 40 cents to 45
cents a bushel above September futures, compared with 40 cents
to 43 cents.  
 “Farmers are beginning to let loose of some corn and
soybeans, but the pipeline supplies have not been replenished”
to load ships, said  Ron Uhe , a risk consultant for Mid-Co
Commodities Inc. in Bloomington, Illinois. “We have a battle
for supplies between processors and exporters.”  
 Soybean futures for August delivery gained 15.25 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $9.83 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices rose 2.9 percent yesterday, the biggest advance for the
contract since Oct. 12. The oilseed has climbed 5.6 percent this
month after the USDA said that inventories as of June 1 fell to
the lowest level since 2004.  
 Corn futures for September delivery rose 7.25 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $3.855 a bushel. The contract jumped 6.6 percent
last week after the USDA said farmers planted less this year
than they planned.  
 U.S. exporters sold 116,000 metric tons of soybeans for
delivery before Aug. 31 to China, the Department of Agriculture
said today. Ethanol production in the U.S. rose 2.8 percent in
the week ended July 2 from a week earlier, an Energy Department
report showed today.  
 “There was talk that China was buying more U.S. soybeans
today,” Uhe said. “Ethanol processors are running near full
capacity.”
