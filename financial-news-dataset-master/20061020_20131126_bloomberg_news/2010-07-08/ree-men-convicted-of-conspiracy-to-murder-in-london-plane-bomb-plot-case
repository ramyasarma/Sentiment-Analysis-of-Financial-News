             Three British men were convicted of
conspiracy to murder in a case tied to a plot to blow up several
airplanes departing London and bound for North America,
according to the  Crown Prosecution Service .  
 The case in London’s Woolwich Crown Court involving  Ibrahim Savant ,  Arafat Waheed Khan  and  Waheed Zaman  dates to 2006 and
was a retrial, after a jury in September was unable to decide
whether the men were guilty of plotting to blow up the aircraft
with bombs.  
 “They were cleared in the previous trial of being aware of
the ultimate targets of the plot, but we say that they were
committed to the principle of violent jihad to the point of
targeting innocent people,” Sue Hemming, head of the
prosecution service’s counter-terrorism division, said in an e-
mailed statement.
