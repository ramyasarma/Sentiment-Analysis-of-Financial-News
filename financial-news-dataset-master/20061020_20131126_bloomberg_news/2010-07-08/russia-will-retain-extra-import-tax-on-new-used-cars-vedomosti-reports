             Russia won’t drop import duties of 30
to 35 percent on new and used cars, increased last year as part
of anti-crisis measures, and will keep them until at least 2012,
Vedomosti reported, citing Economy Ministry.  
 The increased duties were to have expired on July 12 and
were prolonged automatically as Russia joined the Customs Union
with Kazakhstan and Belarus, the newspaper said.
