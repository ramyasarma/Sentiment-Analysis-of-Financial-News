             Tronox Inc.  would be taken over by
noteholders and other unsecured creditors under the chemical
maker’s proposal for exiting bankruptcy.  
 General unsecured creditors owed $470.6 million would split
all of the new stock Tronox will issue when it exits bankruptcy.  
 Pollution claims of as much as $5.2 billion would be
resolved by paying government agencies and other environmental
creditors as much as $145 million in cash and giving them 88
percent of the proceeds from a lawsuit, new convertible,
preferred stock and insurance proceeds.  
 Tronox, based in Oklahoma City, said the plan contains the
“principal elements” necessary to settle U.S. government
environmental claims.  
 Tronox makes chemicals for paints, coatings, plastics,
paper, batteries, toothpaste, sunscreen and shampoo. The company
has disputed its responsibility for many polluted sites,
including more than 600 mining-related sites and 270 chemical
labs.  
 It sued  Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  and Kerr-McGee in May
2009, saying the companies’ 2006 spinoff of Tronox saddled it
with $550 million in environmental liabilities.  
 The bankruptcy case is Tronox Inc., 09-10156, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
