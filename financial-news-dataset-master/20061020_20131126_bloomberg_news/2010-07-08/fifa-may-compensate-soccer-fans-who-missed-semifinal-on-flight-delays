             Soccer’s governing body said it may
compensate fans who missed last night’s World Cup semifinal
between Spain and Germany in Durban because of congestion at the
South African city’s new airport.  
 Fans had their flights into King Shaka Airport delayed
after an increase in private jets took up all the landing slots,
South Africa’s Ministry of Transport said in an e-mailed
statement. The attendance at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium for
Spain’s 1-0 victory was 1,800 below the capacity of 62,760.  
 FIFA Spokesman Nicolas Maingot  said today that the Zurich-
based organization is “definitely looking into” the cases of
fans affected by yesterday’s flight problems.   
 Sibusiso Ndebele , South Africa’s Transport Minister,
apologized to the fans, adding in the statement that the
ministry and aviation authorities will work together to
“strengthen their private aircraft operator facilitation plans
for the remainder of the World Cup.”
