             The dollar-denominated RTS Index
climbed for the third day this week, as crude oil advanced to a
one-week high after gains in U.S. retail sales spurred
speculation the global recovery is on track.  
 OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, and oil
producers OAO Lukoil and OAO Surgutneftegaz advanced. Those
movements pushed the RTS Index 1.5 percent higher to 1,372.33 as
of 10:15 a.m. in Moscow.  
 Crude for August delivery rose as much as $1.03, or 1.4
percent, to $75.10 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
