             Exports  from Germany, Europe’s
largest economy, jumped more than twice as much as economists
forecast in May as the global recovery gathered pace.  
 Sales abroad , adjusted for working days and seasonal
changes, rose 9.2 percent from April, when they fell 6.3
percent, the  Federal Statistics Office  in Wiesbaden said today.
Economists forecast an increase of 4 percent, the median of 10
estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey  shows.  Imports  surged 14.8
percent.  
 “German exports will rise strongly this year and remain
the driver of growth next year as well as demand from emerging
economies, especially in Asia, compensates for lower demand in
the euro area,” said  Joerg Lueschow , an economist at WestLB AG
in Dusseldorf. “Later in the year, we will also see positive
impulses from a weaker euro.”  
 Concern about spiraling deficits in euro-region countries
has pushed the single currency down 12 percent against the
dollar this year, making German-manufactured products more
competitive outside the region. The Bundesbank on June 11 raised
its German growth forecasts to 1.9 percent for 2010 and 1.4
percent for 2011, citing global demand as the “main driving
force” of the recovery.  
 From a year earlier, German exports rose 28.8 percent in
June. Exports to countries outside the European Union surged
39.5 percent, while sales to countries in the region increased
22.8 percent.  
 Bayerische Motorenwerke AG , the world’s largest luxury
automaker, on July 2 forecast it will sell 120,000 cars and
sport-utility vehicles in China this year after first-half
deliveries doubled.  Volkswagen AG , Europe’s biggest carmaker,
said on June 16 it expects profits and deliveries to rise
“significantly” in 2010.  
 Germany’s  trade surplus  narrowed to 9.7 billion euros
($12.3 billion) from 13.1 billion euros in April. The surplus in
the current account, a measure of all trade including services,
was 2.2 billion euros, down from 11.3 billion euros the previous
month.
