             The European Central Bank won a court
ruling invalidating the German part of  Document Security Systems
Inc. ’s European patent for a method to prevent copying bank
notes.  
 The Federal Court of Justice, Germany’s highest civil
tribunal, said in an e-mailed  statement  today the patent isn’t
valid for use in Germany. The ruling granted the ECB’s appeal of
a lower-court ruling which the central bank had lost.  
 The case is part of a nine-nation battle over the patent.
Rochester, New York-based Document Security’s right to the
technology has so far been upheld in the Netherlands and Spain,
where the Frankfurt-based bank has filed an appeal.  
 The ECB has succeeded in revoking the patent in Austria,
Belgium, France, Italy and the U.K. A case in Luxembourg is
still pending.  
 “The court is, similar to the English and French courts,
of the opinion that the patent granted exceeds the scope of” the
technology the company originally applied to protect, the judges
wrote. “For the territory of Germany, the validity has been
retroactively voided.”  
 The ECB welcomes the ruling, Wiktor Krzyzanowski, a
spokesman for the bank said.  
 The German case is BGH, Xa ZR 124/07.
