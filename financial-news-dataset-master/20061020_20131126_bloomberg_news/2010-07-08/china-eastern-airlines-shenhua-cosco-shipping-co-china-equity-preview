             China’s stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index capping its biggest weekly gain this year, on
speculation the government will wind back tightening measures
that helped make the gauge Asia’s worst performer in 2010.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  climbed 2.3 percent.  Poly Real
Estate Co.  paced gains by developers after the central bank said
it will stick to a moderately loose monetary policy and the
Oriental Morning Post reported some Shanghai banks have resumed
lending to third-home buyers.  PetroChina Co.  and Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co. led an advance by energy producers, China’s  worst
performers  this year.  
 The Shanghai index tumbled 27 percent in the first half of
2010 on concern government efforts to curb property speculation
will slow the world’s third-largest economy. The gauge climbed
3.7 percent this week as  technical indicators  signaled the
market was “oversold,” according to CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.
and Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 “There are some expectations that the government may ease
its tightening measures such as those for mortgages,” said  Wang Zheng , a fund manager at Jingxi Investment Management Co. in
Shanghai. “Stocks have also declined too much.”  
 The  Shanghai Composite , which tracks the bigger of China’s
stock exchanges, climbed 55.77, or 2.3 percent, to close at
2,470.92. The weekly gain is the most since the final week of
2009, when the gauge advanced 4.3 percent. The index traded at
17.6 times reported earnings at the end of last week, the lowest
in 18 months.  
 The  CSI 300 Index , measuring yuan-denominated stocks, or A
shares, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rose 2.8 percent to 2,647.10.  
 Monetary Policy  
 Money and loan growth was “reasonable” in the first six
months and liquidity in the banking system “basically
appropriate,” the central bank said yesterday after its second-
quarter monetary policy meeting.  
 The central bank dropped a reference in the previous
statement, in March, to the management of loan and credit growth
being an “arduous task.” A reduced trade surplus this year and
bank quotas limiting lending have helped officials to begin
reining in liquidity, helping to contain inflation risks.  
 Poly Real Estate , China’s second-largest developer by
market value, advanced 3.8 percent to 11.42 yuan, paring an
annual loss to 34 percent. China Vanke Co., the biggest, rose
2.4 percent to 7.24 yuan. Gemdale Corp., the fourth largest,
added 2.5 percent to 6.52 yuan.  
 Some Shanghai-based commercial banks have resumed providing
loans for third-home purchases and have eased lending policies
for second-home purchases, the Oriental Morning Post reported.  
 Bank Comments  
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp. and Bank of China Ltd. denied the report.
Spokespeople for the three banks said in interviews they are
complying with a government order to freeze lending for third
homes.  
 PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil company, rose 1.5
percent to 10.53 yuan.  Yanzhou Coal , the listed unit of China’s
fourth-biggest coal miner, jumped 6.5 percent to 16.93 yuan. An
index tracking energy producers surged 4.9 percent, the most
since Feb. 3 and the biggest gainer among the 10 industry groups
on the CSI 300. The energy index is the worst performer this
year.  
 A Chinese business climate index rose to 135.9 in the
second quarter from 132.9 in the first quarter, according to a
statement released by the National Bureau of Statistics.  
 Stocks have fallen in 2010 even as companies forecast
higher earnings. Around 54 percent of A share companies’ first-
half guidance indicate year-on-year net income growth of more
than 50 percent, UBS AG’s Hong Kong-based strategist  John Tang 
wrote in a report July 6.  
 ‘Soft Landing’  
 “The economy is expected to have a soft landing and that
won’t cause a big slump in earnings growth,” said  Wei Wei , an
analyst at West China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “We expect a
rebound until the end of the earnings season.”  
 Authorities intensified a crackdown on property speculation
after announcing the economy expanded at an 11.9 percent annual
pace in the first quarter, the most since 2007.  Kenneth Rogoff ,
the Harvard University professor, said this week China’s
property market is beginning a “collapse” that will hit the
nation’s banking system.  
 Technical indicators also signal the rebound may continue.
The CSI 300’s daily Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
indicator and relative strength index are “showing positive
divergence signs since May, signaling an imminent change in the
downtrend,” CMIB analysts  Nigel Foo  and  Kong Seh Siang  wrote in
a report today.  
 Stocks ‘Oversold’  
 Nomura Holdings Inc. said this week the CSI 300 is in a
“good position” to recover after it touched the bottom band
that marked this year’s downward trend.  
 The CSI 300’s 14-day RSI, a gauge of how rapidly prices
gain or decline, suggests Chinese stocks are “oversold,”
according to a July 7 report by Nomura analysts Kenneth Chan,
Tacky Cheng and  Desmond Chan .  
 China Eastern Airlines Corp. , the nation’s second-largest
carrier, led gains by carriers after China Business News
reported the carrier’s passenger numbers increased 70 percent
last month from a year ago.  
 China Eastern  advanced 5.6 percent to 6.77 yuan, the most
since April 10. Air China Ltd., the nation’s largest
international carrier, rose 3.9 percent to 10.79 yuan. China
Southern Airlines Co., the nation’s biggest carrier by fleet
size, added 4.1 percent to 6.29 yuan.  
 The following companies were among the most active in
China’s markets. Stock symbols are in brackets after companies’
names.  
      China North Optical-Electrical Technology Co.  (600435 CH)
surged the 10 percent daily limit to 12.94 yuan. The company
said first-half profit may have jumped more than 50 percent from
a year earlier on increased sales.  
  Northeast Securities Co.  (000686 CH) slid 5.1 percent to
23.06 yuan after saying first-half profit fell about 77 percent
from a year earlier.  
 Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical Co.  (600789 CH) advanced 4.8
percent to 8.06 yuan after the Chinese drugmaker said first-half
profit likely rose eight fold.  
 Shanghai International Airport Co.  (600009 CH), the
operator of China’s second-busiest airfield, added 3.3 percent
to 11.95 yuan. The stock was rated “buy” in new coverage by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts  Ronald Keung  and Tom Kim, who
said they “most preferred” the company among Chinese airports.  
 Tangshan Jidong Cement Co . (000401 CH) rose 3.1 percent to
16.60 yuan after saying its first-half profit will as much as
double from a year ago on higher sales.
