             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock-index futures
fluctuated after the International Monetary Fund raised its
forecast for the nation’s economic growth this year while noting
that Latin American economies “face some risk of overheating.”  
 Gerdau SA , Latin America’s largest steelmaker, may move
after saying it will increase its investment in a steel mill in
Brazil’s Minas Gerais state to 2.4 billion reais ($1.36
billion). Direcional Engenharia SA may be active after the real
estate company’s contracted sales in the second quarter rose 69
percent.  
 Bovespa stock-index futures were little changed at 63,915
at 8:25 a.m. New York time. The gauge gained yesterday,
completing the biggest two-day rise in six weeks, as traders
pared bets for higher interest rates after Brazil’s consumer
prices were unchanged in June.  
 Brazil, the region’s largest economy, may grow 7.1 percent
this year, up from a previous prediction of 5.5 percent, the IMF
said today in a report. Growth will slow to 4.2 percent next
year, below the world average of 4.3 percent, the IMF said.  
 The Washington-based fund said central banks in emerging-
market nations have tightened monetary policy “appropriately”
and must remain responsive to potential threats to growth.  
 Vale SA may be active after the world’s biggest exporter of
iron ore completed its sale of minority stakes in the Bayovar
project in Peru for $660 million. The shares rose 2.4 percent to
44.59 reais yesterday.  
 The  Bovespa index  trades for 11.7 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.1 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.1
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.5 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
