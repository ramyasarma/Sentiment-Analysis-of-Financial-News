             Treasuries  fell, pushing 10-year
 yields  above 3 percent for the first time this month, after data
showing a bigger-than-forecast drop in initial claims for
unemployment benefits last week damped bonds’ haven appeal.  
 Yields on U.S. debt rose for a second day after the Labor
Department said initial claims fell to 454,000. The
International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for global
growth this year. The government, which will sell a record-tying
$12 billion of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities today,
said it will auction $69 billion of notes and bonds next week.  
 “The tone to the overall market has become a little more
positive with the economic numbers, and supply is weighing on
Treasuries,” said  Larry Milstein , managing director of
government and agency debt trading in New York at R.W.
Pressprich & Co.  
 The yield on the 10-year note increased 3 basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.02 percent at 12:15 p.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. It touched 3.05
percent, the highest level since June 28. The price of the 3.5
percent security maturing in May 2020 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per
$1,000 face amount, to 104 2/32. The  30-year bond  yield rose 3
basis points to 3.99 percent and touched 4.02 percent, also the
highest since June 28.  
 Treasuries trimmed losses as U.S. stocks pared gains amid a
retreat by financial and energy shares. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index was up 0.1 percent after gaining as much as 1 percent.  
 Treasuries ‘Overbought’  
 “Treasuries have been overbought for a while now,”
 William O’Donnell , U.S. government bond strategist at Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc in Stamford, Connecticut, wrote in a note
to clients. The firm is one of 18 primary dealers that trade
with the Federal Reserve. “The Treasury market has begun a
needed consolidation and correction phase.”  
 Initial jobless claims decreased by 21,000 in the week
ended July 3, Labor Department data showed today in Washington.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop to
460,000. The number of people receiving unemployment insurance
dropped to the lowest point since 2008, while those getting
emergency benefits also declined.  
 The world economy will expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the
biggest gain since 2007, compared with an April projection of
4.2 percent, the Washington-based IMF said in revisions
yesterday to its World Economic Outlook. Growth next year is
projected to be 4.3 percent, unchanged from the April forecast.  
 Improved Risk Sentiment  
 “The IMF’s upgrade to its growth forecast helped improve
risk sentiment,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist
at Monument Securities Ltd. in London.  
 European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
rising market interest rates don’t reflect any plan by the ECB
to tighten policy and signaled the bank will keep its benchmark
rate at a record low in coming months.  
 “It would be a complete mistake to interpret what we
observe in the market as a monetary policy signal,” Trichet
said at a press conference in Frankfurt after the ECB left its
benchmark interest rate at 1 percent.  
 The Treasury may face challenges selling securities that
offer insurance against inflation, according to  Michael Pond ,
the head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at Barclays Plc.  
 “A significant concession is needed for the auction to go
well,” Pond said in a note to clients dated July 2. Barclays is
one of the 18 primary dealers that are required to bid at the
government debt sales.  
 Inflation Expectations  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a
gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices, touched 1.68
percentage points yesterday, the narrowest since Oct. 5. The
spread was 1.76 percentage points today.  
 The Fed’s preferred price measure, which excludes food and
fuel, rose 1.3 percent in May from a year earlier. The figure
was 1.2 percent in April, within 0.1 percentage point of the
lowest level since 1963.  
 The 10-year TIPS being sold today yielded 1.32 percent in
pre-auction trading.  
 The U.S. sold $8 billion of 2020 1.375 percent inflation-
indexed notes on April 5 at a yield of 1.709 percent, with the
number of bids 3.43 times the amount of bonds on offer.  
 The government in May added more frequent auctions of TIPS
to improve the liquidity of the securities, whose principal is
adjusted to reflect changes in the consumer price index.  
 The Treasury said it will sell $35 billion in three-year
notes, $21 billion in 10-year debt and $13 billion in 30-year
bonds on three days starting July 12, matching forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey of 10 primary dealers.  
 TIPS have returned 3.4 percent this year, compared with 5.8
percent for Treasuries that don’t offer inflation protection,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  
 Investors snapped up Treasuries in the second quarter on
speculation European efforts to cut government spending would
slow the global economic expansion.  
 Ten-year yields will climb to 3.54 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg News survey, with the most recent
forecasts given the heaviest weightings.
