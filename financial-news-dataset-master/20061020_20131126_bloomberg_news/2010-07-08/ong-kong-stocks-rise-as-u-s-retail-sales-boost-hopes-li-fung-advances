             Hong Kong stocks  rose, driving the
Hang Seng Index higher for the second time in three days, after
a trade group said U.S. retail sales climbed and the
International Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecast.  
 Li & Fung Ltd., the world’s biggest supplier for retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., advanced 1.9 percent.  HSBC
Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest lender by market value, climbed
2.5 percent on speculation European banks will pass stress tests.
 Cnooc Ltd. , China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, gained 1.3
percent after saying it’s in final talks with Tullow Oil Plc to
develop oilfields in Uganda.  
 “It’s nice to see better news as the broad economic
picture has been pretty bleak,” said  Tim Leung , who helps
manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“We are seeing a technical rebound since the market has been a
bit oversold.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 1 percent to close at 20,050.56.
The gauge dropped 3.8 percent last week, halting five straight
weeks of gains, as reports on U.S. manufacturing, employment and
home sales pointed to slower growth in the second half of the
year.  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies increased 0.6 percent to 11,375.29.  
 Stocks advanced today after the International Council of
Shopping Centers trade group said U.S. retailers’ sales probably
expanded at an average monthly rate of 4 percent in the first
five months of the retail year that began Jan. 31, the biggest
gain since 2006. Separately, the IMF raised its 2010 global
growth forecast to 4.6 percent from an April projection of 4.2
percent.  
 U.S. Retail Sales  
 Li & Fung, which got about 64 percent of sales from the U.S.
last year, rose 1.9 percent to HK$35.20.  Yue Yuen Industrial
(Holdings) Ltd. , the supplier of athletic shoes that counts the
U.S. as its biggest market, gained 1.2 percent to HK$24.75.  
 Foxconn International Holdings Ltd., the world’s biggest
contract maker of mobile phones, advanced 1.2 percent to HK$5.03.
Esprit Holdings Ltd., a clothing retailer that gets 85 percent
of its revenue in Europe, rose 3.2 percent to HK$42.20.  
 Futures on the Hang Seng Index gained 1.2 percent to 20,029.
Almost five stocks rose for each one that fell on the 43-member
gauge.  
 The benchmark index has fallen 8.3 percent this year as
worries about budget deficits in Europe and tighter monetary
policy in China dented confidence in the strength of the global
economy.  Shares  in the measure are priced at an average 13.3
times estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16, when
the index hit its high for 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 ‘Overarching Challenge’  
 “The overarching policy challenge is to restore financial-
market confidence without choking the recovery,” the IMF said
in revisions yesterday to its World Economic Outlook. The fund’s
new growth forecasts “hinge on implementation of policies to
rebuild confidence and stability, particularly in the euro
area.”  
 A gauge of financial stocks in the Hang Seng Index gained
1.1 percent, the most of four industry groups. HSBC increased
2.5 percent to HK$73.  Standard Chartered Plc , the British lender
that generates the majority of its earnings in Asia, jumped 4.5
percent to HK$202.  
 People with knowledge of the European debt crisis said bank
stress tests may assume a 17 percent loss on Greek bonds, half
of the worst-case scenario estimated by JPMorgan Chase & Co. EU
regulators are relying on the stress tests to restore public
confidence in banks amid concern that some lenders don’t have
enough capital to withstand a default by a European country.  
 Merchants Bank  
 China Merchants Bank Co., China’s fifth-biggest lender,
gained 1.4 percent to HK$18.62. The lender said first-half  net
income  will be more than 50 percent greater than the 8.26
billion yuan ($1.2 billion) recorded a year earlier.  
 Cnooc  gained 1.3 percent to HK$12.86. The company said it’s
in “final discussions” on cooperating with Tullow Oil to
develop three oil blocks in Uganda’s Lake Albert basin following
approval from the African nation’s government.  
 China Gas Holdings Ltd.  advanced 1.7 percent to HK$4.28
after the energy supplier to homes and business on the mainland
said it plans to almost double sales of natural gas in the next
two years. Net income in the year ended March rose more than
sevenfold to HK$875.6 million ($112.4 million), China Gas said
yesterday.  
 Among stocks that fell today, Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corp. plunged 10 percent to 53 Hong Kong cents on
plans to sell as many as 1.5 billion new shares.  
 Guotai Junan International Holdings Ltd. , a Chinese
brokerage, lost 3.7 percent to HK$4.14 on its first trading day.
The stock had earlier declined as much as 4 percent to HK$4.13
from its initial public offering price of HK$4.30.
