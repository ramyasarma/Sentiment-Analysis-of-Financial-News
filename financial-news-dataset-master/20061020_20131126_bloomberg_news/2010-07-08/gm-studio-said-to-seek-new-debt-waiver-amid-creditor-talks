             Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. , the film
studio up for sale after falling behind on $3.7 billion in debt,
will ask lenders to extend a moratorium on interest payments,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation.  
 The Los Angeles-based company will e-mail ballots to more
than 100 creditors this week, said one of the people, who asked
not to be named because discussions are private. The current
forbearance expires on July 14.  
 A payment waiver would be the sixth since October and give
a committee of MGM’s five largest creditors time to negotiate a
restructuring that would include a cash infusion. The lenders,
who control more than 50 percent of the debt, are in talks with
Spyglass Entertainment and “Twilight” producer Summit
Entertainment, to run MGM for them, people said in May.  
 Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. , which produces the  Tyler Perry  films and distributes the “Saw” horror series, also has
held preliminary merger talks with MGM, people said last month.
Any proposal could be blocked by investor  Carl Icahn , who
controls almost 38 percent of Vancouver-based Lions Gate and has
said he may seek control of its board.  
 MGM’s largest creditors had sought to put a restructuring
deal in place before seeking the forbearance, one of the people
said. The responses are due back by the middle of next week, the
person said.
