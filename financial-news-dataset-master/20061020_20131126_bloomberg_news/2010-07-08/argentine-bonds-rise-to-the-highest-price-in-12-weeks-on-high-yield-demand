             Argentine benchmark dollar bonds rose
to their highest price in 12 weeks as investors sought the
nation’s higher-yielding securities.  
 The yield on the country’s 7 percent dollar bonds due in
2015 slid 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, to 11.98
percent at 11:35 a.m. New York time, according to pricing from
Deutsche Bank AG. The price rose 0.75 cent to 83 cents on the
dollar, the highest since April 15.  
 “Argentine fixed-income yields are high, and the
probability of default is very low in the short term,” said
 Javier Salvucci , a portfolio manager with Silver Cloud Advisors
in Buenos Aires. “If the U.S. stock market stabilizes,
Argentine fixed income is going to soar.”  
 U.S. stocks rose today, giving the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index its first three-day rally since April, as the
International Monetary Fund lifted its estimate for global
growth and U.S. jobless claims decreased.  
 Argentina’s peso fell 0.1 percent to 3.9354 per dollar from
3.9334 yesterday.
