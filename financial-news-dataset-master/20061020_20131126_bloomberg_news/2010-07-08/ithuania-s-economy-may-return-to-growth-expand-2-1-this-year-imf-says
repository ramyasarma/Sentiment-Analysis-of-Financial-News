             The Lithuanian  economy , which
suffered the European Union’s second-deepest contraction last
year, will return to growth in 2010 as exports rebound, the
International Monetary Fund said.  
 The Baltic country’s economy, which probably shrank by a
fifth from peak to trough during the global crisis,may expand
2.1 percent this year, the Washington-based fund said in a
report today.  
 “Lithuania is now benefiting from the global recovery,”
the IMF said. “Recent data are encouraging with signs that an
economic recovery is starting to take hold.”  
 The government, which pushed through austerity measures
equivalent to about 10 percent of gross domestic product, was
able to use lower borrowing costs to avoid turning to the IMF
for a loan. Real gross domestic product may return to pre-crisis
levels only in 2014 to 2015, the IMF said.  
 “The Lithuanian economy faces important challenges of high
fiscal deficits and rapidly growing public debt as well as a
high stock of non-performing bank loans,” the IMF said in the
report.  
 Some Lithuanian banks “are not as well provisioned and
capitalized, and also face pressure on interest rate margins,”
the IMF said. “Directors considered it important that banks be
subjected to forward-looking stress tests to ensure viability.”
