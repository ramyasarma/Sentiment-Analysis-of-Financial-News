             Europe’s  economy  will grow this year
and next more slowly than recoveries in the U.S., Canada and
Japan, as financial turmoil from a sovereign debt crisis
restrains the region’s expansion, the  International Monetary
Fund  said.  
 Gross domestic product in the 16 euro-area nations will
rise 1 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2011, the
Washington-based lender said today in revisions to its World
Economic Outlook. The 2010 forecast was unchanged from the IMF’s
April prediction and next year’s outlook was cut from 1.5
percent.  
 The global recovery will progress even with a “modest
negative effect” on euro-region growth, and financial market
conditions in the area “are assumed to stabilize and improve
gradually,” the IMF said.  
 The effect of the financial turmoil and tighter credit will
be cushioned by depreciation of the euro, which will boost
exports, the IMF said.  
 Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, will expand 1.4 percent
this year, up from 1.2 percent projected in April, the IMF said.
France’s growth estimate of 1.4 percent was cut from 1.5 percent
in April.  
 The fund raised Italy’s projected growth rate to 0.9
percent from 0.8 percent, and said Spain’s economy will shrink
0.4 percent, the same as its April forecast.  
 Germany, France  
 For next year, the IMF trimmed Germany’s growth by 0.1
percentage point to 1.6 percent, and said France will also
expand 1.6 percent, down from its prior forecast of 1.8 percent.
It also cut Italy’s growth estimate by 0.1 percentage point to
1.1 percent, and projected Spain will expand 0.6 percent in
2011, down from its April forecast of 0.9 percent.  
 Projections for the euro region hinge on making the 750
billion-euro ($948 billion) European Stabilization Mechanism
fully operational, and resolving uncertainty about banks’
holdings of sovereign debt to rebuild confidence, the IMF said.  
 Publishing the results of the ongoing stress tests in
Europe is “a step in the right direction,” the IMF said.  
 The measures should be complemented by plans to strengthen
capital levels at banks, and increase transparency of the
activities of European financial institutions that aren’t
publicly traded or do not publish quarterly accounts, the IMF
said.
