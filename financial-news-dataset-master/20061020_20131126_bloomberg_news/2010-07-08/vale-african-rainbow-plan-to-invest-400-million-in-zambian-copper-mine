             Vale SA , the world’s biggest exporter
of iron ore, and  African Rainbow Minerals Ltd.  will invest $400
million in the development of a new copper mine at Konkola North
in northern Zambia.  
 Construction of the mine will begin in September and is
expected to take two-and-a-half years to complete, Eduard
Ledsham, an executive director at Rio de Janeiro-based Vale,
told reporters today in Lusaka. Ledsham was in the country as
part of a Brazilian business delegation traveling with President
 Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  on his six-nation tour of Africa.  
 “The Konkola North mine will become a kick-off for our
copper mining in Africa,” Ledsham said. “We expect to have
another project for exploration in the area near this one.”  
 The Konkola North mine, located north of the Konkola Deep
mine operated by  Vedanta Resources Plc , will start production in
2013. Initial output is estimated at 50,000 metric tons a year,
which will later be expanded to 100,000 tons, Ledsham said.  
 Zambia is Africa’s biggest copper producer.  
 Lula held talks with Zambian President Rupiah Banda while
in Lusaka, before departing for Johannesburg, South Africa.
