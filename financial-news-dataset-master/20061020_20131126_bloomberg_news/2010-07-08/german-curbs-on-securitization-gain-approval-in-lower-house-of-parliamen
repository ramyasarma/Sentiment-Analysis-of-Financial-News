             Germany’s lower house of parliament
approved a bill that makes securitization more costly than in
other European Union countries as Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition aims to limit financial-market risks.  
 The measure, passed by coalition lawmakers in Berlin today,
lets financial companies invest in securitizations only if the
sellers keep at least 10 percent of the risk on their books. An
EU directive calls for originators to retain a risk of at least
5 percent.  
 To avoid disadvantages for the German financial industry,
the 5 percent retention will be effective for two years before
the 10 percent participation rate goes into effect, according to
the draft.  
 The bill is a response to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis
that set off the financial crisis and a global recession. It
still requires approval in the upper house, where Germany’s
state governments are represented. No date is set for that vote.  
 “The extent and the global spread of the real-estate and
financial-market crisis would not have been possible without
these securitizations,” the bill said.
