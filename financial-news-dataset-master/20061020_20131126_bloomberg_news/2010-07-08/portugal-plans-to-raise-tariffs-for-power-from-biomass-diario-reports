             The Portuguese government plans to 
raise tariffs for electricity production from biomass this 
year, Diario Economico reported, citing Carlos Zorrinho, the 
secretary of state for energy.  
 The new tariff will take into account the inflation rate 
when the government invites bids for projects and the estimated
time it will take for the plants to start operating, the 
Portuguese newspaper said.
