             Brazil’s real rose to the highest
level in two weeks after U.S. jobless claims fell more than
economists forecast, raising speculation demand for the South
American nation’s exports will grow.  
 The real strengthened 0.5 percent to 1.7595 per dollar at
9:15 a.m. New York time after climbing to 1.7583 per dollar
earlier today, the strongest level since June 21. The Brazilian
currency has gained 0.7 this week. Brazilian markets are
scheduled to be closed tomorrow.  
 The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits last
week fell to 454,000. Economists had forecast jobless
applications would fall to 460,000 from an initially reported
472,000 for the prior week, according to the median of 36
projections in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Much of the data out of the U.S. has been on the
disappointing side, and if we can break that trend, that bodes
well for risk appetite,” said  Clyde Wardle , an emerging-market
currency strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York. “When
risk appetite is increasing, we see flows out of the dollar into
emerging market currencies.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 11.31 percent.
