             Infrastructure Development Finance Co. 
sought approval from shareholders to raise 8.4 billion rupees
($179.24 million) selling compulsorily convertible preference
shares to Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Actis.  
 IDFC, an Indian state-run lender for roads, ports and power
projects, will issue the shares to Khazanah, Malaysia’s
sovereign wealth fund, for 3.8 billion rupees and London-based
private equity firm Actis for 4.6 billion rupees, IDFC said in a
statement today.  
 The shares will give a cash dividend of 6 percent per annum
and can be converted into equity anytime in the next 18 months
at a price of 176 rupees a share, the statement said. IDFC rose
1.1 percent to 181.40 rupees at close of trading in Mumbai today.  
 Last week, the Mumbai-based lender raised 26.5 billion
rupees selling stock to institutional investors at a price of
168.25 rupees a share. The move followed board approval in April
to raise 35 billion rupees to fund expansion.  
 The share issuances will enable IDFC to “take larger
exposure to single/group entities,”  Goldman Sachs  analyst
 Tabassum Inamdar  said in a note to clients on July 6. The sales
will also help IDFC meet higher capital adequacy norms of 15
percent after being classified as an infrastructure finance
company and “maintain low leverage and therefore higher credit
rating,” she said in the note.  
 The lender was classified as an infrastructure finance
company by the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central bank,
in June.
