             Man Group Plc , the firm that’s buying
hedge-fund rival GLG Partners Inc., said assets under management
declined 2.3 percent in the fiscal first quarter as market
volatility weighed on sales.  
 Assets dropped to $38.5 billion in the three months ended
June 30 from $39.4 billion on March 31, the London-based firm
said in a statement today. That exceeded the $38.3 billion
median estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
outflows totaled $1 billion in the period, compared with $1.4
billion a year earlier, Man Group said.  
 “Given the continued market uncertainty, sales in the
quarter have, as anticipated, remained subdued,” Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Clarke  said in the statement.  
 The world’s largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager
agreed in May to buy New York-based GLG for $1.6 billion to
broaden its range of funds. The acquisition will create a firm
with about $63 billion in assets, easing dependence on Man AHL
Diversified Plc, an investment program that accounts for more
than half of Man’s holdings.  
 “It was a weak quarter, but that’s what was expected,”
said  Keith Baird , a London-based analyst at Oriel Securities
Ltd. with a “hold” recommendation on the shares. “There’s
limited downside in the stock, but there are question marks over
where sales growth comes from in the future. That depends on the
performance of AHL.”  
 Institutional Clients  
 Man Group shares advanced 3.8 pence, or 1.8 percent, to
220.9 pence as of 10:36 a.m. in London, valuing the company at
about 3.8 billion pounds.  
 Man AHL Diversified Futures Ltd. , which uses computer
programs to identify trades in more than 150 futures markets
around the world, gained 3 percent this year through June 28
after slumping 16 percent last year for its first loss,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund rose 1.2
percent in the last quarter, while the MSCI World Index of
stocks in 24 developed nations slumped 13 percent.  
 Institutional clients’ funds under management were $11.4
billion as of June 30, compared with $12.6 billion on March 31,
Man said today.
