             TD Securities, the investment-banking
unit of  Toronto-Dominion Bank , bought closely held Ross Smith
Sousa Advisors Ltd. to help it advise on oil and gas
transactions.  
 Ross Smith Sousa, based in Calgary, specializes in asset
acquisitions and divestitures, TD Securities said today in an e-
mailed statement. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  
 The acquisition will become part of TD Securities’ global
energy and power advisory group. All of Ross Smith Sousa’s
employees, including President  Rodrigo Sousa , have agreed to
join TD Securities.  
 “Our clients have increasingly requested a technical
component to our existing breadth of offering in the energy
sector,”  Drew MacIntyre , head of the global energy and power
group at TD Securities, said in the statement.  
 TD Securities said it has been retained by  Encana Corp.  as
exclusive financial adviser “with respect to the sale of
certain natural gas and oil assets.”  
 Ross Smith Sousa is unrelated to  Ross Smith Energy Group
Ltd. , also of Calgary, which provides research on oil and gas
exploration and production.
