             Sugar rose, extending a rally to the
highest price in 11 weeks, on speculation that output in Brazil,
the world’s largest producer, may be smaller than forecast due
to adverse weather.  
 Dry weather between September and November may reduce
yields of the cane crop in the Center South, which produces
about 90 percent of Brazil’s sugar, Marco Antonio dos Santos, a
meteorologist with Sao Paulo-based forecaster Somar, said
yesterday. The start of next year’s harvest may be also delayed
to as late as May from March, Santos said.  
 “The stocks would be tight again going forward,” said
Erick Mello de Figueiredo, a trader at Sao Paulo-based Terra
Futuros, Brazil’s largest commodities broker. “The market is
starting to discount reduction of next year’s harvest.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.11 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 17.17 cents a pound at 10:26 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. Earlier, the price reached 17.3 cents, the highest level
for a most-active contract since April 20.  
 The cane crop in the Center South may drop to 595 million
metric tons next year, 4.8 percent smaller than 625 million tons
forecast in April, due to high temperatures and low rainfall,
Figueiredo said. Sugar output may be reduced to 31.84 million
tons from 33.45 million, he said.  
 Sugar may rise to 20 cents by the end of the month,
Figueiredo said. That would mark the highest level since March
11.  
 Before today, futures slumped 37 percent this year on
forecasts for higher output in Brazil and India, the biggest
producers.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, refined-sugar futures for
October delivery rose $9.30, or 1.8 percent, to $521.20 a metric
ton.
