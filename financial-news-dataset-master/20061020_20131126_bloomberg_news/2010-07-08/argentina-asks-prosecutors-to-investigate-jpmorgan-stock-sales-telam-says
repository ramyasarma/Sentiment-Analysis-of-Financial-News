             The head of the Argentine agency
dedicated to fighting money laundering asked prosecutors to
investigate  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Grupo Clarin SA, Banco
Patagonia SA and Consultatio SA, saying they manipulated the
price of stocks at public offerings, the country’s state-run
news agency  Telam reported .  
 Jose Sbatella, head of Argentina’s Financial Information
Unit, filed the request for the probe, Telam said, citing a
statement from the agency. A copy of the UIF’s statement
couldn’t be found on its  website  after normal business hours.  
 The request is based on testimony from former JPMorgan
employee  Hernan Arbizu , Telam said.  
 Arbizu, an Argentine, fled the U.S. in 2008 after being
indicted for embezzlement. He has been sued by the bank for
allegedly stealing money from a client account and taking
confidential information about customers. Arbizu said in an
interview in Buenos Aires last year that the charges against him
are true and that he didn’t profit from the transactions.  
 “The complaint has no grounds,” Clarin said by e-mail.
“The offerings were made in London and Buenos Aires according
to all international norms.”  
 JPMorgan spokesman  Brian Marchiony  declined to comment to
Bloomberg. A call to the mobile phone of Argentina government
spokesman  Alfredo Scoccimarro  wasn’t answered. Nobody was
immediately available to comment at the other companies.
