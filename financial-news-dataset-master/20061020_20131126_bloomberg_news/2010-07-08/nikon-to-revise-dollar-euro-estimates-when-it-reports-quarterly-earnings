             Nikon Corp. , a Japanese maker of
cameras and chip-manufacturing equipment, will revise its
foreign exchange estimates for the dollar and euro, President
 Makoto Kimura  said.  
 The company will determine the new assumptions by the time
it reports April-June earnings, Kimura said in an interview
today in Tokyo. “The first-quarter results may beat our
projection but we can’t be optimistic because of currency
fluctuations.”  
 The yen has gained about 19 percent against the euro and 5
percent against the dollar this year. Nikon, which earned more
than 80 percent of its revenue  outside Japan  in the 12 months
ended March 31, is using currency hedging and increasing
overseas procurement of parts to become less vulnerable to
fluctuations in exchange rates, Kimura said.  
 The Tokyo-based camera maker assumes a yen exchange rate of
90 yen to the dollar and 120 yen to the euro for the fiscal year
to March 2011, it said May 11. The yen traded at 88.36 to the
dollar and 111.82 to the euro at 12:45 p.m. Tokyo time. A
stronger yen erodes the value of overseas earnings at a Japanese
company when repatriated.  
 Nikon  rose  3.8 percent to 1,607 yen as of 1:13 p.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average rose 2.5 percent.  
 Nikon loses about 700 million yen ($7.9 million) and 900
million yen of annual operating profit for every 1 yen weakening
in the value of the dollar and euro respectively, according to
the company.  
 The company is scheduled to announce its  quarterly earnings 
on Aug. 5.
