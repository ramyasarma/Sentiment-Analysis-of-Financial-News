             The rand gained to its strongest in
more than a week after the International Monetary Fund raised
its global growth forecast and reports showed South African
manufacturing grew while business confidence rose.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy appreciated as
much as 1.2 percent to 7.5355 per dollar, the strongest since
June 28, and traded 0.8 percent up at 7.5646 by 4:52 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a close of 7.6252 yesterday. Against the
euro, the rand climbed 0.2 percent to 9.5896.  
 The world economy will expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the
biggest gain since 2007, compared with an April projection of
4.2 percent, the Washington-based IMF said yesterday. Sub-
Saharan Africa’s economy will expand 5 percent, compared with an
April forecast of 4.7 percent, the IMF said.  
 “Positive global sentiment will keep the rand and other
risky assets buoyant today,”  Michael Keenan , a currency
strategist at  Standard Bank Group Ltd.  in Johannesburg, wrote in
a client note today.  
 The MSCI  Emerging Markets Index  of stocks has lost 5
percent this year while the rand, the Czech koruna and the
Polish zloty are among developing-nation currencies that have
weakened on concern Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will curb
global growth. Developing-nation assets rebounded today after
the IMF issued its report.  
 South Africa’s  manufacturing  expanded an annual 7.9 percent
in May after gaining a revised 8.6 percent in April, a sixth
straight month of expansion, Statistics South Africa said today.
 Business confidence  increased to the highest level in nine
months in June as the World Cup boosted sentiment, the Chamber
of Commerce and Industry said.  
 Bonds  
 Government bonds rose for a third day, with the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 gaining 28 cents to
124.05 rand. The yield fell 6 basis points to 7.75 percent.  
 Investors increased bets the central bank will lower its
6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next meets on July
22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month
contracts for cash in three months  fell 4.5 basis points to 6.29
percent, the lowest since the central bank introduced the
repurchase rate in 1999.
