             A rebound in mergers and acquisitions
in the chemical industry is being slowed by the high price tags
placed on assets by sellers, according to UniCredit analyst
 Andreas Heine .  
 BASF SE ’s purchase of Cognis Holding GmbH for $3.9 billion
and Bain Capital LLC’s $1.63 billion takeover of Dow Chemical
Co.’s styrene unit mark a pick-up in activity this year, yet
pricing remains a constraint on deal-making, Heine said.  
 “The crisis was hefty, but short -- too short for prices
to come down,” Heine said in a phone interview. “There has
been no bargain hunting.”  
 Among the chemical companies that may be poised to pounce
on available assets is Belgian plastics maker  Solvay SA , which
may use its 6.5 billion-euro ($8.2 billion) war chest to target
flavors and fragrances maker  Symrise AG , Heine said. After
buying Dow Chemical in March, Bain may buy BASF’s styrene
business to consolidate assets if antitrust rules permit,
according to UniCredit.  
 Dutch paint maker  Akzo Nobel NV  is the most likely suitor
for Australia’s DuluxGroup Ltd., Heine said. Shareholders of
parent company Orica Ltd. approved the de-merger of the business
today. Royal DSM NV can finance acquisitions of as much as 3
billion euros, Heine and colleagues said in a note to clients.  
 Synthetic rubber maker  Lanxess AG  could be interested in
Eliokem SAS, and may dispose of businesses including functional
chemicals and rubber chemicals, UniCredit wrote.
