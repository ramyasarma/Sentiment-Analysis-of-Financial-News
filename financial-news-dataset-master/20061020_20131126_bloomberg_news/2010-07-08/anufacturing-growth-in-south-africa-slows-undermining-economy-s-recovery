             South African  manufacturing , which
accounts for 15 percent of the economy, expanded at a slower
pace in May than in the previous month, weakening the recovery
in Africa’s biggest economy.  
 Factory output rose an annual 7.9 percent after gaining a
revised 8.6 percent in April, Pretoria-based  Statistics South
Africa  said on its website today. The median estimate of 12
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for an 8.3 percent gain.
 Output  rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in the month.  
 Manufacturing output may come under pressure as the
European debt crisis threatens to slow growth in a region that
buys almost a third of South African exports. The country’s
 purchasing managers index  fell below 50 for the first time in
eight months in June, indicating a contraction in manufacturing
output, Kagiso Securities Ltd. said on July 1.  
 “The recovery is taking place, but it is hesitant, fragile
and uneven,” Reserve Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  said yesterday.
“Its sustainability will be dependent on the global recovery in
general and in Europe in particular.”  
 The  economy  expanded an annualized 4.6 percent in the first
quarter, boosted by manufacturing and mining output and a
recovery in consumer spending. The Reserve Bank, which has cut
its benchmark interest  rate  seven times to 6.5 percent since
December 2008, will make its next rate decision on July 22.
