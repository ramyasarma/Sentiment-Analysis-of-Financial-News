             Angola’s central bank resumed
government bond auctions yesterday after a two-month halt and
said it will conduct the sales on a daily basis in future,
according to a  statement  on its website.  
 The Luanda-based bank sold 8 billion kwanza ($86 million)
of bonds with maturities varying between 28 days to 364 days,
Bloomberg data show.  
 Bond sales were suspended in late May while the southern
African nation’s government concluded a review of its budget,
Reuters reported.
