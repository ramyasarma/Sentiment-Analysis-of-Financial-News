             Cotton fell for the third time in
four sessions on speculation that production in the U.S., the
world’s largest exporter, will exceed last month’s government
forecast.  
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture tomorrow probably will
boost its estimate of the  2010-2011 crop  to 17.47 million bales,
from a June forecast of 16.7 million, according to a Bloomberg
survey of nine analysts. Planted acreage jumped 19 percent to
the highest level in four years, the USDA said June 30.  
 “I’m expecting the USDA to raise the crop estimate by
about a million bales,” said  John Flanagan , the president of
Flanagan Trading Corp. in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina. “I’m
also expecting them to increase world consumption by a million
bales, so that will take some of the sting out of it.”  
 Cotton for December delivery dropped 0.57 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 73.99 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
The price has plunged 15 percent since touching a two-year high
of 87.1 cents on April 26.  
 As of July 4, 65 percent of the U.S. crop was in good to
excellent condition, compared with 42 percent a year earlier,
the USDA said on July 6.
