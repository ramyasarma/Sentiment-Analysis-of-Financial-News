             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from default fell to the lowest in two weeks on
speculation stress tests for Europe’s biggest banks will ease
concern about the health of the region’s financial system.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of credit-default swaps on 50
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan dropped 9 basis points
to 131 basis points as of 10:27 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to
Credit Agricole CIB. That’s the lowest since June 23, according
to CMA DataVision in New York.  
 “Fears of a worst-case scenario in Europe have diminished,
which is having a positive effect on global risk appetite,”  Tim Condon , chief Asia economist for ING Groep NV, said in a
telephone interview from Singapore.  
 The European Union plans to publish so-called stress tests
this month designed to restore public confidence in banks amid
concern that some lenders don’t have enough capital to withstand
a default by a European country. A stress test of U.S. banks
last May spurred a rally that lifted the Standard & Poor’s
Financials Index 36 percent in the following seven months.  
 People with knowledge of the plan said lenders may assume a
17 percent loss on Greek bonds, half the worst case scenario
estimated by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The tests would also assume a
loss of 3 percent on holdings of Spanish bonds, the people said.  
 “Such criteria would be tough enough to give the stress
tests some credibility without making the results look too
negative,”  Dariusz Kowalczyk , a Hong Kong-based strategist at
Credit Agricole CIB, wrote in a note to clients today. JPMorgan
had estimated losses of 10 percent to 20 percent on Spanish
bonds, according to a note yesterday.  
 Risk Benchmarks  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 10 basis points
to 127 basis points as of 12:16 p.m. in Sydney, also to the
lowest in two weeks, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. and CMA
data. The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 8.5 basis points to
127.5 as of 10:33 a.m. in Tokyo, the least since June 22, Morgan
Stanley and CMA prices show.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
