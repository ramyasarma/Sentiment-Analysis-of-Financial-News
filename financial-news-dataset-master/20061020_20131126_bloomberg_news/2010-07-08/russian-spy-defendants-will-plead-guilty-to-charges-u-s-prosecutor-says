             Ten members of an alleged Russian spy
ring will plead guilty, a U.S. prosecutor said today during
their arraignment in federal court in New York. All 10 were
charged with one count of conspiracy to act as an agent of a
foreign country without registering with U.S. authorities. Eight
also face a single count of money laundering conspiracy.
