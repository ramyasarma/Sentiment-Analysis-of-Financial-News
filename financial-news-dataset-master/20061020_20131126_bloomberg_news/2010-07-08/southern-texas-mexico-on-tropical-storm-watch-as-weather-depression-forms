             A tropical depression expected to
bring as much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain to parts of
Texas and Mexico will cross the coastline within the next two
hours, according to the  U.S. National Hurricane Center .  
 The “poorly organized” system has maximum sustained winds
of about 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour and was moving
northwest at 15 miles per hour about 30 miles east-northeast of
Brownsville, Texas, according to a hurricane center bulletin
released just before 10 a.m. Houston time.  
 “Winds near tropical storm force may occur in squalls over
portions of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico during the
next few hours,” the hurricane center said.  
 Late yesterday, tropical storm watches were issued along
the Texas coast from near Corpus Christi to the Mexican border
and from Rio San Fernando to the U.S.-Mexico frontier. The
warnings mean winds of 39 miles an hour and stronger are
expected within a day.  
 Those warnings may be canceled within a few hours, the
hurricane center said.  
 In addition, flood warnings and watches have been issued
for most of Texas, according to the National Weather Service.
The Rio Grande River at Rio Grande City, about 90 miles west-
northwest of Brownsville, was expected to rise above flood stage
of 50 feet over the weekend.  
 “Minor flooding is forecast,” the weather service said.
