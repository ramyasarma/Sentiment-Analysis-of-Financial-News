             Former New York Giants middle
linebacker Antonio Pierce retired and will join ESPN as an
analyst, the sports network and National Football League team
said in a news release.  
 Pierce, 31, was diagnosed with a bulging disc in his neck
on Nov. 21 and missed the rest of the season. He was cut by the
team in February.  
 Pierce played nine years in the league and was defensive
captain when the Giants beat the New England Patriots in the
Super Bowl after the 2007 season.
