             Paul Goydos  became the fourth U.S.
PGA Tour player to shoot a score of 59, with a 12-under-par
round today at the John Deere Classic.  
 It’s the first 59 in a PGA Tour event since  David Duval 
reached the mark at the 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.  Chip Beck  matched the feat at the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational, 14
years after  Al Geiberger  became the first to do it at the 1977
Memphis Classic  
 “I kind of realized it on 16 if I birdied the last
three,” Goydos said in a televised interview. “This is why you
play. Knowing what you have to do is part of the fun and today I
accomplished it.”  
 Goydos, 46 and a two-time Tour winner, sank a seven-foot
birdie putt on the 18th hole at the Par-71 TPC Deere Run Course
in Silvis, Illinois, to cap his bogey-free  round . He birdied
eight of the course’s final nine holes after making four birdies
on the first nine. Eight of his  12 birdies  came on putts of at
least 11 feet, including a 39-footer on the par-4 11th hole.  
 Duval, Beck and Geiberger accomplished the feat on par-72
courses.  Annika Sorenstam  is the only woman to shoot 59, during
the second round of the LPGA’s Standard Register Ping tournament
in 2001.  Shigeki Maruyama  shot 58 at a U.S. Open qualifying
event in 2000.  
 Goydos holds a five-shot lead over  Michael Letzig  and Matt
Jones as first-round play continues.
