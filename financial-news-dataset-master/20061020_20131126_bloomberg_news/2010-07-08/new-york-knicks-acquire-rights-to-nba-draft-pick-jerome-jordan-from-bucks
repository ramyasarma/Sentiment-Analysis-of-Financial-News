             The New York Knicks acquired the
rights to center Jerome Jordan from the Milwaukee Bucks for cash
consideration, the teams said in separate statements.  
 Jordan averaged 15.4 points and 9.4 rebounds for the
University of Tulsa last season. He was selected by the Bucks
with the 44th pick in last month’s National Basketball
Association Draft.
