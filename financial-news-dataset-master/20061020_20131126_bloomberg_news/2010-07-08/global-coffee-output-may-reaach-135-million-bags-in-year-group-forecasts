             World coffee production is forecast
at between 133 million to 135 million bags in the 2010-11 crop
year, the London-based International Coffee Organization said in
an e-mailed report. Production in Brazil is estimated at about
50 million bags, the group said. Output in Vietnam is expected
to be between 16 million to 18 million bags, the ICO said. A bag
of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). Brazil is the
world’s biggest producer while Vietnam is the largest grower of
