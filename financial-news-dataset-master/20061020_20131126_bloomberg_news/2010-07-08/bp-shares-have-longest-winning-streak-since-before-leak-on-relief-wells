             BP Plc  rose for a fourth day, the
longest winning streak since the Gulf of Mexico spill started,
as it came closer to stopping the leak and after Chief Executive
Officer  Tony Hayward  met with Abu Dhabi’s crown prince.  
 BP  rose  1.4 percent to 367 pence in London. That’s 20
percent higher than the 14-year low reached last month following
the blowout on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico
on April 20.  
 “There’s an appreciation that the relief wells are ahead
of schedule, and that could be very good for BP,” said  David Hart , an analyst at Westhouse Securities Ltd. in London.
“Drumming up interest in the Middle East also indicates that
there’s some value in the shares after they sold off quite
heavily.”  
 Hayward said yesterday the meeting with  Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed   Al Nahyan , crown prince of Abu Dhabi and chairman of
Mubadala Development Co., an investment arm of the government,
was “very good.” BP spokeswoman  Sheila Williams  said that
Hayward is meeting business partners and employees today in
Angola, where BP produces oil in 11 deepwater fields.  
 In the Gulf of Mexico, BP is drilling two relief wells that
would permanently plug the leak, the first of which is within 15
feet of the leaking well and interception may occur ahead of
schedule, National Incident Commander  Thad Allen  said yesterday.  
 BP spokesman Mark Proegler said July 5 that the first
relief well may be finished by the end of this month, and the
Wall Street Journal reported today that it may be completed by
July 27, when BP reports second-quarter earnings.  
 Three-Month Schedule  
 BP spokesman  Toby Odone  said today the company is sticking
to its schedule to finish the wells three months from the start
of drilling in May.  
 Once the well is reached, crews may need seven to 10 days
to stop the flow by injecting heavy mud, followed by a cement
seal, Allen said.  
 Sovereign wealth funds may be interested in buying BP stock
after its price dropped by about half. Shares are now down 43
percent since the accident.  
 BP is a “good buy,” Shokri Ghanem, Libya’s top oil
official, said in a Bloomberg Television interview this week.
He’s advising Libya’s sovereign wealth fund to invest in the
company.  
 Hayward last month pledged to set aside $20 billion to
compensate the spill’s victims and finance the cleanup. To pay
for it, the company halted dividend payments and plans to sell
$10 billion in assets across the globe.
