             Copper may rise on speculation that a
decline in inventories to a seven-month low signals steady
demand.  
 Eight of 15 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 53 percent, said the metal will gain next week.
Five predicted lower prices and two forecast little change.
Copper for delivery in three months was 4.4 percent higher for
this week at $6,691 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at
3:30 p.m. yesterday.  
 Stockpiles  of copper monitored by the LME yesterday slid to
the lowest level since Nov. 30. They’re down 13 percent this
year, on course for the first annual decline since 2004.
Bookings to remove metal from warehouses have surged more than
12-fold in 2010.  
 “These two factors have been indicating rising demand for
several months now,”  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt, said in a report yesterday. “If general market
sentiment remains positive and the focus of market players
remains on this positive microdata, this should support metal
prices.”  
 The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of July 2.  
 The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
46 of the past 94 weeks, or 49 percent of the time.  
 This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 8  Bearish : 5 Hold: 2
