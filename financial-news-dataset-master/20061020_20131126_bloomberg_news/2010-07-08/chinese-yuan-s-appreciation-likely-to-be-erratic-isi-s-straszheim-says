             The U.S. Treasury’s decision to stop
short of branding China a currency manipulator has made it
harder for the label to be imposed in the future, International
Strategy & Investment Group’s  Donald Straszheim  said.  
 China took a “significant step” last month when it began
to allow markets to drive the currency higher, the Treasury
Department said in a report to Congress released yesterday. The
report said the yuan “remains undervalued.”  
 “The Treasury secretary basically certified that China is
innocent through the second quarter of this year,” Straszheim,
senior managing director for China research at ISI, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “This is Washington raising the
bar on its own behavior. It’s completely wacky.”  
 Yesterday’s report, which concluded that no major U.S.
trading partner manipulates its currency, comes after Chinese
policy makers announced June 19 that they would allow greater
fluctuation. China had been holding its currency at about 6.83
to the dollar from July 2008 to help exporters, after allowing
the yuan to rise 21 percent the three prior years.  
 Straszheim predicted the yuan may appreciate
“erratically” to reach 6.5 per dollar by the end of next year.
The yuan traded at 6.7748 as of 9:52 a.m. in Shanghai.  
 A gradual strengthening of the yuan would be good for China
as it would help curb large inflows of investment money drawn by
expectations for currency appreciation,  Yu Yongding , a former
adviser to the People’s Bank of China, wrote in a commentary
published in today’s China Securities Journal.  
 Trade Tensions  
 House Ways and Means Committee Chairman  Sander Levin  and
Senator  Charles Grassley , the Senate Finance Committee’s top
Republican, both called for the U.S. to file a trade complaint
over the currency issue.  
 Such a move will lead to trade protectionism, harm global
growth and is “not the right solution at all,” said ISI’s
Straszheim, a former president of the Milken Institute and
global chief economist at Merrill Lynch.  
 “If Washington does that, China would slap Washington back
immediately,” he said. “They wouldn’t sit idly by, who knows
where that leads. Neither country wants to go down that road.”
