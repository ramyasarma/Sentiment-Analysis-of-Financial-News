             The current year may become the
warmest on record, according to a  National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration  scientist.  
 Temperature trends across the U.S. and around the world
have been among the warmest on record, said David Easterling, a
climatologist with NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center in
Asheville, North Carolina.  
 “If the warming around the world continues the way it has
so far this year, we are likely to have 2010 be the warmest on
record,” Easterling said during a conference call on climate
change hosted by the  Union of Concerned Scientists , in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  
 The combined land and ocean temperatures around the world
were 1.22 degrees warmer than the 20th-century average, according
to NOAA records. Since 1975, global temperatures have been
rising and since 1960 the number of heat waves has been
increasing, Easterling said on the call.  
 Much of the U.S. Northeast has been gripped by a heat wave
that broke temperature records in New York, Washington and
Baltimore and brought 100 degrees or more to Newark four days in
a row.  
 Energy use has risen and utilities have asked customers to
curb their use to conserve power.  
 “We can’t say that one individual heat wave, or even two
heat waves, are due to global warming but what we can say is
that warming temperatures do increase the probability of a heat
wave,” Easterling said. “The current spate of heat waves could
be a harbinger of things to come.”
