             Germany may reduce its budget deficit
to comply with the European Union limit a year earlier than
currently envisaged,  Handelsblatt  reported.  
 If the government implements all announced measures to
raise tax income and cut spending, it may lower the deficit to
below the 3 percent of gross domestic product limit by 2012
instead of 2013,  Heinz Gebhardt , finance expert at the Essen-
based RWI economic institute, was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.
