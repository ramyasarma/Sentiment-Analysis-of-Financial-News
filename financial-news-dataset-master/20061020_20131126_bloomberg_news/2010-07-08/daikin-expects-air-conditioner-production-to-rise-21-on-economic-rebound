             Daikin Industries Ltd. , the world’s
second-biggest air conditioner maker, expects output of
household units to rise 21 percent this year, recovering to
exceed levels before the crisis sparked by the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  
 Daikin may make 3.28 million air conditioners in the year
ending March 31, the most in its history,  Jiro Tomita , the
executive in charge of the business, said today at a news
conference in Shiga prefecture, western Japan.  
 “Production may even exceed pre-Lehman shock levels,”
Tomita said.  
 Overseas, Osaka-based Daikin plans to produce 480,000
household air conditioners in Europe, 850,000 in Thailand and
500,000 in China. The company produced about 3.1 million units
worldwide in year ended March 31, 2008, prior to the collapse of
Lehman Brothers in September that year.
