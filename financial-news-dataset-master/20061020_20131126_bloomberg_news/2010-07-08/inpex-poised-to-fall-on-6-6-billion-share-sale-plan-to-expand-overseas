             Inpex Corp. shares were untraded and
poised to fall in Tokyo after Japan’s biggest energy explorer
announced a share sale to raise as much as 587.2 billion yen
($6.6 billion) for overseas projects.   
 The shares were offered at 406,000 yen as of 9:57 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange in pre-market trading, lower than
yesterday’s close of 476,000 yen.
