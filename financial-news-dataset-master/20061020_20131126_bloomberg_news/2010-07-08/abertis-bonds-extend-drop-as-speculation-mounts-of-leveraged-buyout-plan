             Bonds of  Abertis Infraestructuras SA 
plunged 13 percent in the past week on investor concerns the
Spanish highway operator’s main shareholders will saddle it with
debt in a leveraged buyout.  
 The company’s 1 billion euros ($1.26 billion) of 4.625
percent notes due 2016 have fallen 13.7 cents on the euro to
88.46 cents, increasing the yield premium over government debt
by more than 260 basis points to 500 basis points, according to
HSBC Holdings Plc prices on Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 Abertis’s two largest shareholders, Criteria CaixaCorp SA
and Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA, are considering
bidding for all of the company with CVC Capital Partners Ltd.,
according to regulatory filings this week. The borrowing to
finance the deal may be as much as 7 billion euros, people
familiar with the situation said this week.  
 Criteria, ACS and CVC will offer 16 euros a share for the
rest of Abertis, Expansion newspaper reported today without
identifying who provided the information. Abertis rose 43 cents,
or 3 percent, to 14.5 euros at 9:40 a.m. in Madrid. The stock
has climbed 20 percent this week.  
 In a leveraged buyout, a buyer funds its acquisition with
money borrowed in the target company’s name, typically causing
the acquired firm’s credit ratings to fall below investment
grade. Abertis is rated BBB+ at Standard & Poor’s, the third-
lowest investment grade, and a level higher at A- by Fitch
Ratings.  
 Investors demanded a spread of 273 basis points to hold
Abertis’s 2016 bonds as recently as July 5. The Barcelona-based
company has 5.17 billion euros of bonds outstanding, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.
