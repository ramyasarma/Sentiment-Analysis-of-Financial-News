             Poland will have three different
presidents today, including one whose term will last for about
10 hours, as part of the transition to President-elect  Bronislaw Komorowski  taking office next month.  
 Komorowski, who became acting president because he was
Parliamentary Speaker when President  Lech Kaczynski  died in a
place crash, won presidential elections on July 4. He left his
previous post today to comply with the Constitution.  
 Senate Speaker Bogdan Borusewicz will fill the spot for
about 10 hours until lawmakers elect  Grzegorz Schetyna  as
Parliamentary Speaker, making him acting president until
Komorowski takes the oath of office. No exact date for the
inauguration ceremony has been agreed.
