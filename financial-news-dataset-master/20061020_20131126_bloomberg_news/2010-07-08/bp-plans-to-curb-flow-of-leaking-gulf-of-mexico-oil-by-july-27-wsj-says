             BP Plc set a new deadline for capping
the leaking Gulf of Mexico well, planning to curb the flow of 
crude oil by July 27, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing 
unidentified company officials.  
 The company is also arranging backup plans, including 
linking the leaking well to existing gas and oil pipelines from
nearby deepwater wells, the newspaper said.  
 BP and the U.S. Coast Guard are still saying publicly that 
a fix will be in place by mid-August, but the date has been 
advanced because of the imminent hurricane season, BP’s plans 
to report earnings on July 27, and the need to show progress 
when U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron visits President Barack 
Obama on July 20, the WSJ said.
