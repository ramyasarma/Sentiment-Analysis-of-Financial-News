             Brazil may set a primary surplus
target in reais and drop the existing goal as a ratio of gross
domestic product, Folha de S.Paulo newspaper  reported  citing a
congressional report for the 2011 budget.  
 The government may set a primary surplus target of 125
billion reais ($70.7 billion) instead of keeping the target at
3.3 percent of GDP, Folha said. The change would be introduced
by the Congress in the 2011 budget guidelines bill, Folha said.  
 The change would allow for a smaller surplus as a
percentage of GDP should economic growth beat forecasts, the
newspaper said.
