             China’s benchmark money-market rate
dropped for a second day after the central bank kept the yield
on three-month bills unchanged, reinforcing speculation it won’t
seek to drain liquidity from the financial system.  
 The three-month bills were sold at a  yield  of 1.5704
percent, the same rate as the last sale on June 24, according to
a statement on the monetary authority’s website today. Demand
for cash also waned as investors who failed to subscribe to
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s shares receive their funds
back. A total of 480.3 billion yuan ($70.9 billion) of capital
was locked up for the subscription, the lender said in a
statement today.  
 “The PBOC won’t seek any more tightening measures because
the economy is certainly facing a slowdown,” said  Liu Junyu , a
Shenzhen-based fixed-income analyst at China Merchants Bank Co.,
the country’s fifth-largest lender by market value. “The seven-
day repo may drop to between 2 percent and 2.3 percent following
the unfreezing of the capital used to buy the AgriBank shares.”  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, declined 12 basis points to 2.48 percent
as of the 4:30 p.m. close in Shanghai, according to the National
Interbank Funding Center. That’s the biggest drop since June 30.  
 The central bank said it will stick to a moderately loose
monetary policy as economic growth becomes better balanced
between consumption, investment and exports, according to a
 statement  published on its website today after its second-
quarter monetary policy meeting. Money and loan growth was
“reasonable” in the first six months and liquidity in the
banking system “basically appropriate,” the statement said.  
 Growth Prospects  
 The International Monetary Fund raised its estimate for
China’s economic growth this year to 10.5 percent from a
previous forecast of 10 percent made in April, according to
revisions to its World Economic Outlook. Financial market
turmoil has increased the risk to a recovery, the Washington-
based fund said.  
 The People’s Bank of China offered 10 billion yuan of
three-month bills at today’s sale. For the week, the central
bank added a net 105 billion yuan to the financial system, a
seventh week in a row of cash injections.  
 Bonds Fall  
 Government bonds fell on speculation gains from last week
were excessive. The yield on the 3.9 percent note due in August
2014 rose one basis point to 2.47 percent, and the price of the
security lost 0.04 per 100 yuan face amount to 105.54, according
to the national funding center. The yield has declined 10 basis
points since June 25.  
 “Bonds yields have dropped amid the recent rebound as
funding liquidity eased,” said  Huang Yanhong , a fixed-income
analyst at Bank of Nanjing Co., a Chinese lender partly owned by
BNP Paribas SA. “Some traders were cautious on concern yields
had touched a near-term bottom.”  
 The yuan traded at 6.7761 per dollar, little changed from
6.7772 yesterday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency has strengthened 0.7 percent since the
central bank loosened control of the exchange rate on June 19.
