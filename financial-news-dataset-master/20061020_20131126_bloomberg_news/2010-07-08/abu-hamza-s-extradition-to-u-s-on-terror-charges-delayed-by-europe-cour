             Abu Hamza al-Masri , an Islamic cleric
jailed for inciting murder and racial hatred, had his
extradition to the U.S. delayed by the  European Court of Human
Rights .  
 The court said Hamza and three other men shouldn’t be
extradited from the U.K. until it reaches a decision on his
claim that the maximum security prison in the U.S. where he is
likely to be jailed would violate a European human rights rule
that prohibits torture and degrading treatment. The court said
it needs more time to rule on that issue.  
 “The European Court of Human Rights has decided that all
the applications are partly admissible,” U.K. Home Secretary
 Theresa May  said. “We await the court’s judgment on the case.
In the meantime these individuals will remain in custody.”  
 The U.S. is seeking to prosecute Hamza on charges he
supported the Taliban with money and troops, set up a terrorist
training camp in Oregon and aided in a 1998 Yemeni kidnapping
that left four dead.  
 The U.K. signed his extradition order after the U.S. gave
diplomatic assurances the cleric’s human rights would be
respected. Hamza had appealed both the lower court decision to
allow his extradition and the U.K. government’s signing of the
extradition papers.
