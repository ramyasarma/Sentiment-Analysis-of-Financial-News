             Hon Hai Group will pay workers 10,000
yuan each to help them relocate from Shenzhen to other 
provinces in mainland China, the United Daily News reported on 
its website today, citing Chairman Terry Gou.  
 Hon Hai expects to complete the transfer of some workers 
from Shenzhen by October, the newspaper reported. The report 
cited Liu Kun, a Shenzhen-based spokesman for Foxconn, 
confirming the move and said it doesn’t mean the company is 
leaving Shenzhen. Edmund Ding, a Taipei-based spokesman, didn’t
answer calls by Bloomberg to his mobile phone today.
