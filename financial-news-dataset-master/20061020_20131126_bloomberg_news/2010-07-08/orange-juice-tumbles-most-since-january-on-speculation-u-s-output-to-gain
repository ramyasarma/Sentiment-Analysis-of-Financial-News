             Orange-juice futures tumbled the most
since January on speculation that production in Florida, the
world’s second-biggest producer, will exceed last month’s U.S.
government forecast.  
 The Department of Agriculture probably will increase its
estimate of the harvest that ends this month to 134 million
boxes from a June projection of 133.6 million, according to a
Bloomberg survey of seven analysts. A box weighs 90 pounds, or
41 kilograms.  
 “My target for the report is 137 million boxes, and demand
is slipping,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld
Futures in Tampa, Florida. “I don’t see demand changing, unless
we have another swine flu epidemic.”  
 Orange juice for September delivery fell 7.65 cents, or 5.3
percent, to $1.3785 a pound at 1 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. A close at that price would mark the biggest drop for a
most-active contract since Jan. 11. Before today, the commodity
surged 65 percent in the past year on bets that supplies will
trail demand.  
 U.S. retail sales of orange juice dropped 6.6 percent in
the four weeks ended June 12 from a year-earlier period, the
Florida Department of Citrus said on June 29, citing Nielson Co.
data.  
 Brazil is the biggest grower.
