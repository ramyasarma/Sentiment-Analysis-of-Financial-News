             Mortgage rates  for 30-year U.S. loans
fell to the lowest on record for the third straight week,
reducing borrowing costs for homebuyers as unemployment and
foreclosures weigh on demand.  
 The average rate declined to 4.57 percent in the week ended
today, the lowest since Freddie Mac began compiling the data in
1971, the mortgage-finance company said in a statement. It was
4.58 last week. Rates for 15-year  loans  rose to 4.07 percent
from 4.04 percent, McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac said.  
 Borrowing costs have tumbled in the past three months amid
investor demand for bonds including mortgage-backed securities.
Lower rates have failed to lift housing sales, which sank after
the expiration of a tax credit for home buyers. An index of
applications to buy homes fell to the second-lowest level since
1997 last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.  
 “The problem right now is there are some other headwinds
going on,”  George Mokrzan , senior economist at Huntington
National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, said in a telephone interview.
“The labor reports have been on the soft side the last couple
of months.”  
 Private employers added fewer workers to payrolls in June
than forecast, according to a Labor Department report on July 2.
Including government, payrolls fell for the first time this year
because of a drop in federal census workers. The U.S.
unemployment rate last month was 9.5 percent.  
 Foreclosure Supply  
 The supply of foreclosed homes for sale is also slowing a
recovery. Foreclosures may reach 1.9 million this year after a
record 2 million in 2009,  Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody’s
Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said last month.  
 U.S.  new home sales  sank 33 percent to an annual pace of
300,000, the lowest level on record, in May, the Commerce
Department said June 23. Existing-home sales  decreased  2.2
percent from April to a 5.66 million annual rate, National
Association of Realtors data showed June 22.  
 It would take 8.3 months to sell all available
3.89 million existing homes, the Realtors association said.  
 Applications to  purchase  a home declined 2 percent in the
week ended July 2, the Mortgage Bankers Association said
yesterday. Lower rates helped push an index measuring
 refinancings  up 9.2 percent.
