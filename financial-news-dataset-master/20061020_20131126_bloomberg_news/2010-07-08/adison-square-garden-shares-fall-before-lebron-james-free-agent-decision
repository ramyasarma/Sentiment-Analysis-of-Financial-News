             It’s not just Cleveland Cavaliers
fans who are suffering today. Traders who bought  Madison Square
Garden Inc.  stock yesterday have seen their hopes fade, too.  
 Today’s slump in Madison Square Garden wiped out $90.2
million in market value as traders bet  LeBron James , the
National Basketball Association’s Most Valuable Player the past
two seasons, will leave Cleveland and join the Miami Heat
instead of the New York Knicks. Madison Square Garden, which
owns the Knicks, gained $98.5 million yesterday on speculation
James would sign with New York.  
 “Madison Square’s action has been the ultimate in event-
related trading,” said  Michael Block , chief equities strategist
at Phoenix Partners Group LP in New York. “I’m not sure anyone
thinks he’s going anywhere but Miami right now.”  
 Madison Square Garden shares fell 5.5 percent to $20.38 at
4 p.m. in New York. The odds that James will sign with the
Knicks sank to 11 percent today from more than 50 percent
yesterday, according to  trading  on the prediction market run by
Dublin-based Intrade. The Heat were at 68 percent and the
Cavaliers 26 percent.  
 James will announce his decision on ESPN during a show
starting at 9 p.m. New York time. The 25-year-old is leaning
toward the Heat, ESPN  reported , citing sources with knowledge of
the situation. He has booked 25 rooms at the W Hotel in Miami
starting tonight, bolstering speculation that’s where he’ll
play, the New York Post  reported , citing a source.  
 Wade, Bosh  
 Dwyane Wade  said this week he’s staying with the Heat, and
 Chris Bosh  will join him. Wade and Bosh were among the top free
agents in the NBA this offseason, along with James.  
 The addition of the 6-foot-10 Bosh, a five-time All-Star,
gives the Heat an inside presence to complement the 6-foot-4
Wade’s playmaking and ability to drive to the basket. Miami
hasn’t won a playoff series since  Shaquille O’Neal  teamed with
Wade to lead the franchise to a  championship  five years ago.  
 “Of course we’d love for LeBron to join Miami.” Wade
said. “Who wouldn’t?”  
 Madison Square Garden will post profit this year of 75
cents a share excluding some items, according to the average of
two estimates in a Bloomberg survey. That compares with earnings
of 37 cents on the same basis for 2009.  
 “The wind seems to have changed,”  Chris Marangi , an
analyst with Gabelli & Co. in Rye, New York, said of
expectations about where James will play. Marangi covers Madison
Square Garden stock and has a “buy” rating. “It’s a
disappointment for the company, but earnings will probably still
go up regardless of not having LeBron.”
