             Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
approval rating fell to 43.4 percent ahead of the July 11 upper
house election, down 15.4 percentage points from a survey taken
last month, Kyodo News reported, citing its own poll.  
 Some 46.8 percent of respondents said they disapproved of
Kan’s discussion of doubling the  consumption tax  to 10 percent,
while 45.3 percent said they approved, Kyodo said. The survey
was conducted yesterday and today by telephone, Kyodo said,
without stating the number of respondents or a margin of error.  
 Ballots for half the  upper house’s  242 seats will be held
on July 11, when Kan’s  Democratic Party of Japan  faces the
country’s voters for the first time since it last year displaced
the Liberal Democratic Party, which had governed almost
uninterrupted for half a century.
