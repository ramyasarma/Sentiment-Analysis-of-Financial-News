             Japanese  stocks  rose, boosting the
Nikkei by the most in more than a month, after a U.S. trade
group said retail sales in the world’s biggest economy grew at
the fastest pace in four years.  
 Sony Corp., which gets more than a fifth of its sales from
the U.S., increased 4.4 percent.  Canon Inc. , which receives
almost 80 percent of its sales outside Japan, advanced 3.3
percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, gained
2.6 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s
largest bank by market value, rose 3.4 percent amid speculation
that stress tests of Europe’s lenders will be less severe than
forecast. Chipmakers jumped on the outlook for growing demand.  
 “The markets had been falling for a long time, so people
who had been short on stocks now have a reason to buy,” said
 Koichi Kurose , chief strategist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd.,
which manages about $54 billion. “Positive data surprises show
the global economy is on track to recovery.”  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  increased 2.8 percent to
9,535.74 as of the close of trading in Tokyo, the most since
June 3. The broader Topix index rose 2.3 percent to 861.02, with
about 10 stocks advancing for each that fell.  
 The Nikkei 225 has tumbled 9.6 percent this year as
Europe’s deficit and China’s measures to curb economic growth
fueled concerns about the strength of the global economy.
Companies in the gauge trade at 17.7 times estimated earnings,
compared with 12.9 times for the S&P in the U.S. and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 Sony, Canon  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped 0.2
percent. Yesterday, the gauge rallied 3.1 percent in New York,
after the International Council of Shopping Centers trade group
said U.S. retailers’ sales are growing at the fastest pace in
four years. Banks advanced as second-quarter operating profit of
 State Street Corp. , the third-largest U.S. custody bank, beat
estimates.  
 A gauge for electrical appliance companies, which includes
Sony and Canon, climbed 3.5 percent, the fourth-biggest increase
among the Topix’s 33 industry groups. All the  groups  rose today.  
 Sony, the maker of Bravia televisions, gained 4.4 percent
to 2,423 yen. Canon increased 3.3 percent to 3,445 yen. Toyota,
which derives 28 percent of its sales from North America,
advanced 2.6 percent to 3,130 yen. It was the  biggest
contributor  to the Topix’s gain.  
 The yen depreciated to as low as 88.46 against the dollar
today, compared with 87.49 at the close of stock trading in
Tokyo yesterday. Against the euro, it fell to as much as 112.01
from 110.09 yesterday. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  
 U.S. Retail Sales  
 U.S. retail sales probably expanded at an average monthly
rate of 4 percent in the first five months of the retail fiscal
year that began Jan. 31, the biggest gain since 2006, the
International Council of Shopping Centers trade group said.  
 “The general consensus was that the U.S. economy was going
to deteriorate, and the good retail sales put a brake on that
view,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $450 million at
Tokyo-based Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  
 Stocks also rose after European banking regulators told
lenders that their planned stress tests may assume a loss of
about 17 percent on Greek government debt, according to two
people briefed on the talks who declined to be identified. The
percentage was half the worst-case scenario estimated by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Japanese Banks  
 A gauge of bank stocks was the  third-biggest contributor  to
gains by the Topix.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ rose 3.4 percent to 428 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest bank by market
value, advanced 3 percent to 2,679 yen.  Resona Holdings Inc. , No.
4, rose 2.8 percent to 1,091 yen.  
 In the U.S., State Street reported second-quarter earnings
per share of 93 cents, above the mean estimate of 72 cents by
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “We will likely see good numbers come out in the upcoming
earnings season,” said Kurose. “The question is whether they
can continue.”  
 Chipmakers advanced after a report that Tokyo Electron Ltd.,
the world’s biggest manufacturer of chip-production equipment,
will spend 1 billion yen ($11 million) to increase output in
Iwate, northern Japan, by 20 percent, the Iwate Nippo newspaper
said, without citing anyone.  
 Tokyo Electron  
 Tokyo Electron jumped 5.2 percent to 4,900 yen, its highest
close since May 13.  Advantest Corp. , the world’s largest maker
of memory-chip testers, increased 6 percent to 1,881 yen, for
the third-biggest gain in the Nikkei 225.  Sumco Corp. , which
makes silicon wafers for the semiconductor industry, rose 5.2
percent to 1,586 yen.  
 The Nikkei newspaper also reported that global
semiconductor sales will maintain growth as increasing demand in
Asia overcomes concerns European demand will wane.  
 JX Holdings Inc. , Japan’s biggest refiner and No.1 copper
producer, jumped 6.3 percent to 489 yen, as prices of oil and
copper climbed. It had the biggest gain on the Nikkei 225,
extending yesterday’s 3.4 percent advance after the Yomiuri
newspaper reported the company is in talks with China Petroleum
and Chemical Corp. to build a lubricant plant in China.
