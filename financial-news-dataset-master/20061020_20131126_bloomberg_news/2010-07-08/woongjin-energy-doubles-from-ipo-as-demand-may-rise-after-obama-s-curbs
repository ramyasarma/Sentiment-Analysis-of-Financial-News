             Woongjin Energy Co.  rose, helping the
South Korean solar-power equipment parts maker almost double
from its debut last week on expectations it will benefit from
growing U.S. alternative energy demand as it boosts output.  
 The  stock  climbed 12 percent to 18,250 won as of 11:42 a.m.
on the Korea Exchange, after rising 15 percent yesterday, while
the benchmark  Kospi  stock index added 1.2 percent. Woongjin
Energy, which began trading on June 30, has surged from its
initial share sale’s price of 9,500 won.  
 Woongjin Energy plans to invest 283.7 billion won ($234
million) to expand production of ingots and wafers, the company
said in a filing yesterday after the close. Hyundai Securities
Co. increased its share-price forecast for Woongjin to 21,000
won from 17,000 won, saying in a report dated yesterday the
company will gain from an expanding U.S. market.  
 “There should be increasing demand by utilities to expand
renewable energy generation facilities” in the U.S., Hyundai
analysts led by  Han Byung Hwa  wrote. “The company could benefit
a lot.”  SunPower Corp. , the second-biggest U.S. manufacturer of
solar power modules,  holds  31 percent of Woongjin Energy.  
 The Obama administration proposed tougher air pollution
rules for 31 states from Massachusetts to Texas that may lead
energy companies to shut some power plants. The regulations
would cut sulfur dioxide, which produces acid rain, by 71
percent by 2014 from 2005 levels, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency. It would reduce nitrogen oxide, the cause of
smog, by 52 percent over the same period.  
 Shinsung Holdings Co., a South Korean solar-cell maker,
also climbed 6.6 percent to 6,800 won.
