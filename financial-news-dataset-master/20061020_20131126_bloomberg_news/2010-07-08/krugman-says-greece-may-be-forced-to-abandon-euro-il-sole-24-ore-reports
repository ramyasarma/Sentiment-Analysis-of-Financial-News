             Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul
Krugman told Il Sole 24 Ore that Greece could be forced to
abandon the European single currency.  
 “I would not be surprised if one or two countries had to
leave it,” Krugman told the Italian financial newspaper in a
telephone interview. “The problem is that there is a common
currency for a region that never fulfilled the criteria to be
part of that currency.”  
 He cites Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland as nations at
risk.
