             Palm oil rebounded from the lowest
level in almost eight months as a rally in crude and soybeans
spurred demand for the commodity’s use in alternative fuels.  
 Palm oil for September delivery rose 0.8 percent to 2,289
ringgit ($715) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange,
lifting it from the lowest since Nov. 13 yesterday. Prices added
1.8 percent intraday.  
 “Palm oil and crude oil are expected to rise in tandem,”
said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland
Asia Securities (Singapore) Pte. “Biodiesel’s prospects are
improving.”  
 Edible oils, mostly used for food, can also be used as
additives in biofuel.  
 Crude oil rose 0.9 percent to $74.74 a barrel at 6:28 p.m.
Singapore time. Crude prices rallied 2.9 percent in New York
yesterday after the International Council of Shopping Centers
estimated U.S. retail sales expanded the most in four years.  
 Soybeans in Chicago, crushed for a substitute oil, gained
0.1 percent to $9.3325 a bushel at 6:30 p.m. Singapore time. It
surged 3.6 percent yesterday to $9.325 a bushel on speculation
that heavy rainfall will reduce yields in the U.S.  
 The 2011 outlook for the demand and supply of vegetable
oils provides support for palm oil, said a JPMorgan Securities
(Malaysia) Sdn. report dated July 6. JPMorgan is “neutral-to-
positive on the outlook for soybean oil which crude palm oil is
more closely correlated to due to the strong supportive demand
for the vegetable oil complex in general.”  
 Support Level  
 Prices will stay at about the 2,300 ringgit support level
until clues can be discerned from the June data on Malaysian
production, exports and stockpiles, said Arhnue Tan, a senior
analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board
usually releases the data on the 10th of each month or the next
working day.  
 Malaysia is the second-largest producer and there’s concern
stockpiles of the commodity will rise as exports slow, Tan said.  
 Ryan Long , a trader at OSK Investment Bank Sdn. in Kuala
Lumpur, said the data might be ”slightly friendly for price.”  
 “It’s technically a bit oversold,” he said.  
 June palm oil exports from Malaysia climbed 1.5 percent to
1.35 million tons, cargo surveyor Intertek said on June 30. The
advance was 1.2 percent to 1.34 million tons, according to rival
Societe Generale de Surveillance.  
 CME Group Inc.’s September-delivery palm oil contract,
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, gained 0.4 percent to
$715 a ton yesterday.  
 On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil
climbed 1 percent to 6,284 yuan ($927) a ton in Shanghai while
soybean oil gained 0.9 percent to 7,394 yuan.
