             Copper advanced for a fifth day in
London, driving other industrial metals higher, as equities
jumped and dwindling stockpiles signaled steady demand.  
 Three-month delivery copper gained as much as 1.2 percent
to $6,725 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  Asian
stocks  rallied after U.S. equities surged as growth in American
retail sales bolstered optimism in the earnings season and
investors speculated European banks will pass stress tests.  
 “On the positive side for copper, equities are rising and
LME stockpiles keep declining,” said  Hwang Il Doo , a senior
trader at KEB Futures Co. in Seoul. “Given these supportive
factors, there might have been an influx of fund money into
metals since the third quarter started.”  
 LME copper climbed 0.5 percent to $6,675 a ton at 2:51 p.m.
in Shanghai. Copper for September delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$3.0250 a pound on the Comex in New York.  
 Copper inventories tracked by the LME dropped to 439,350
tons, the lowest level since Nov. 30, and have fallen 13 percent
this year. A full-year decline would be the first since 2004.  
 Bookings to remove copper from LME warehouses increased 2.5
percent to 35,075 tons, just 350 tons less than the level on
July 1, which was the highest in almost four months.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 1.8 percent to 115.36
as of 3:51 p.m. in Shanghai. The gauge has fallen 11 percent
from its high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt
crisis and Chinese steps to curb property prices will hurt
global growth. Oil climbed for a second day in New York.  
 Equities Jump  
 The U.S.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  surged 3.1 percent
yesterday, the most since May, after the  International Council
of Shopping Centers  trade group said retail sales probably
expanded at an average monthly rate of 4 percent in the first
five months of the retail fiscal year that began Jan. 31, the
biggest gain since 2006.  
 “With copper prices swinging close to the upper end of a
recent range between $6,300 and $6,850, we may see some selling
later this week,” KEB’s Hwang said. The strengthening dollar
may cap price increases, he said.  
 The Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the greenback’s
strength, was at 83.904, compared with 83.822 yesterday.  
 Copper for October delivery climbed 1.6 percent to close at
52,990 yuan ($7,820) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Shanghai aluminum was up 0.5 percent at 14,980 yuan and zinc
rose 1 percent to 15,345 yuan.  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery in London gained 0.3
percent to $1,992 a ton, lead climbed 1.8 percent to $1,826.75
and zinc was 0.1 percent up at $1,855 a ton. Nickel rose 0.7
percent to $19,275 a ton, while tin fell 0.3 percent to $17,600.
