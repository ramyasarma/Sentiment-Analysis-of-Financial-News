             The People’s Bank of China sold
three-month bills at a yield of 1.5704 percent in open-market
operations, unchanged for a second sale, according to traders at
China Citic Bank Corp. and BOC International (China) Ltd.  
 The central bank had let the yield rise at four consecutive
weekly auctions since May 20 before keeping it stable in the two
following sales.  
 The monetary authority offered 10 billion yuan ($1.5
billion) of the notes due in 91 days at the auction today.
