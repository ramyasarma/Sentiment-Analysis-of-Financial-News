             Asian stocks, the euro and won rose
to their highest levels this month on optimism the global
economy will avoid a second recession. Oil rebounded from a
four-week low, copper climbed for a fifth day and concern about
corporate debt defaults waned.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  advanced 1.8 percent to 115.30
as of 4 p.m. in Tokyo. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 0.7
percent. The euro strengthened to as much as $1.2688 and the won
gained 0.6 percent. Oil climbed to $74.52 a barrel.  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  futures fell 0.2 percent.  
 The International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for
global growth after a stronger-than-expected first half. U.S.
equities surged yesterday by the most in almost six weeks after
retail sales climbed and on speculation European banking stress
tests will show narrower losses than some analysts estimated.
The MSCI World Index has declined 14 percent from this year’s
high on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and China’s
steps to cool its economy will derail a recovery.  
 “I doubt we’ll have another global recession,” said
 Masayuki Kubota , a fund manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which oversees $51 billion. “People are very
sensitive to economic data from the U.S. If something good comes
out, market sentiment easily rebounds. I’m buying sectors which
were sold on excessive pessimism.”  
 Stock Indexes  
 The MSCI World has gained 4 percent in the past three days.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average jumped 2.8 percent today, the
biggest increase among equity indexes in the Asia-Pacific region.
Australia’s SPX/ASX 200 Index gained 2.4 percent and Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index advanced 1.5 percent. Asian indexes added to
gains after the IMF said the world economy will expand 4.6
percent in 2010, the biggest increase since 2007, compared with
an April projection of 4.2 percent.  
 Toyota Motor Corp.  advanced 2.6 percent and was the top
contributor to the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. BHP Billiton Ltd.
rose 2 percent in Sydney and JX Holdings Inc., Japan’s biggest
copper producer, soared 6.3 percent as the metal climbed.
Advantest Corp., the world’s No. 1 maker of chip-testing
equipment, leapt 6 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said
semiconductor demand is rising. Posco, South Korea’s No. biggest
steelmaker, gained 3.1 percent. China Merchants Bank Co. rose
2.7 percent in Hong Kong after forecasting higher profit.  
 The euro gained to the strongest level in seven weeks versus
the dollar. European Union banking regulators have told lenders
their planned stress tests may assume a loss of about 17 percent
on Greek government debt and 3 percent on Spanish bonds,
according to two people briefed on the talks, half of the worst-
case scenario estimated by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Aussie Gains  
 The Australian dollar rose to a one-week high versus the
greenback after government data showed employers added three
times more jobs than economists expected.  
 The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific bonds from non-payment
fell to the lowest level in two weeks. The Markit iTraxx Asia
index of credit-default swaps on 50 investment-grade borrowers
outside Japan dropped 9.5 basis points to 130.5 basis points,
according to Credit Agricole CIB. That’s the lowest since June
23, according to CMA DataVision in New York.  
 Oil climbed to the highest level in a week, gaining 0.6
percent, following the retail-sales data and a report showing a
drop in crude inventories in the U.S.  
 A U.S. retail-trade group said yesterday that sales were
growing at the fastest pace since 2006, easing concern that a
slump in consumer confidence will scuttle the economic recovery.  
 Reversal in Sentiment  
 “The general consensus was that the U.S. economy was going
to deteriorate and the good retail sales put a brake on that
view,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $450 million at
Tokyo-based Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  
 The market value of stocks worldwide, as measured by the
 Bloomberg World Exchange Market Capitalization Index , tumbled 15
percent from a 2010 high in April to July 5, erasing $7.6
trillion, on slower U.S. growth, and concern over Europe’s debt
crisis and China’s steps to cool its economy.  
 “The retail sales numbers in the U.S., after a whole host
of disappointing data recently, provided a boost to sentiment,”
said  Toby Hassall , an commodity analyst at CWA Global Markets
Pty in Sydney.
