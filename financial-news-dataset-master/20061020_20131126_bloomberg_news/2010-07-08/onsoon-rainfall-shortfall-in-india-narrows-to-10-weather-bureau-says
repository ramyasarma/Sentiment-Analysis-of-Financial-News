             The shortfall in India’s monsoon, the
main source of irrigation for the nation’s 235 million farmers,
narrowed to 10 percent as of yesterday, the weather office said.  
 The nation received 204 millimeters of rain in the June
1-July 7 period, compared with the 50-year average of 226.5
millimeters, the India Meteorological Department said on its
website. The monsoon was 16 percent below normal last month.
