             China will suspend initial share
sales in Shanghai and Shenzhen for a week to ensure Agricultural
Bank of China has a successful trading debut, the South China
Morning Post reported, without citing anyone. AgriBank shares
are due to start trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong next week.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission was not available for
comment yesterday, according to the report.
