             Gold futures fluctuated between gains
and losses amid speculation that the dollar will weaken,
boosting demand for the precious metal as an alternative asset.  
 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent against a  basket  of six
major currencies, heading for the fifth straight weekly decline.
Gold traditionally has moved inversely to the dollar. The metal
reached a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21 and rallied to
all-time highs in euros, sterling and Swiss francs as investors
sought a haven during Europe’s fiscal crisis.  
 “Gold is in transition,” said  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago. “You have a
more traditional gold and dollar relationship coming back, but
it’s very fragile.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $1.50, or 0.1
percent, to $1,200.40 at 9:10 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The
price fell as much as 0.2 percent and rose as much as 0.8
percent.  
 A rally in equities may also boost demand for the precious
metal, McGhee said. Gold dropped 3.9 percent last week as
investors sold gold to cover losses in the stock market. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 8.5 percent in the previous two
weeks, before rebounding 3.7 percent this week through
yesterday.  
 “If the relief rally in stocks holds, we’ll see gold start
moving higher,” McGhee said. “If it doesn’t last, we’ll see
people look to raise money again by selling gold.”  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 4 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $18.04 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $9.80, or 0.6
percent, to $1,536.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Palladium futures for September delivery rose $5.90,
or 1.3 percent, to $448.25 an ounce.
