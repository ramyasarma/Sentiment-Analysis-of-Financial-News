             Mexico’s  consumer prices  fell 0.03
percent in June from a month earlier, led by lower costs for
tomatoes, onions and grapes, the central bank said.  
 Prices rose 3.69 percent from a year earlier, the bank said
today on its Web site. Economists expected monthly inflation of
0.01 percent and forecast an annual rate of 3.74 percent,
according to the  median estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The drop in prices was driven by volatile categories such
as fruits and vegetables, meaning the trend won’t last, said
 Italo Lombardi , an economist at BNP Partibas SA in New York.  
 “This will revert as you have different climate
conditions,” Lombardi said in an interview. “There’s still a
lot of slack in the economy.”  
 Core inflation, which excludes some food and energy prices,
was 0.13 percent in June, matching analysts’ estimates.  
 Mexico’s peso rose 0.2 percent to 12.8053 per U.S. dollar
at 10:34 a.m. New York time. The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent
peso bond due in 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 7.03 percent, according to Banco Santander SA.  
 Mexico’s central bank will raise borrowing costs in March
2011, according to the median estimate of analysts in a survey
released July 6 by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit. JPMorgan Chase
& Co. and Barclays Capital are among banks that say the first
increase won’t come until 2011.  
 Lending Rates  
 The central bank kept its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged
at 4.5 percent for the tenth straight meeting last month, saying
domestic demand remains weak. Banco de Mexico cut the benchmark
rate by 3.75 percentage points last year amid the global
financial crisis.  
 Mexico’s economy grew 7.2 percent in April from a year
earlier, as measured by the global economic indicator. Gross
domestic product grew 4.3 percent in the first three months of
the year from the same period a year earlier.  
 Latin America’s second-biggest economy is recovering from a
6.5 percent contraction last year, the biggest slump since 1932.
The central bank forecasts growth of 4 percent to 5 percent this
year.  
 Mexican remittances rose 12 percent in May from a year
earlier. Money sent from workers living outside Mexico climbed
to $2.13 billion in May from $1.9 billion in the same month a
year earlier, according to central bank figures.
