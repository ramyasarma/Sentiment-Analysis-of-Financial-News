             Japan’s population of foreign
nationals dropped for the first time in 48 years, led by
Brazilians, as the nation’s auto industry cut factory jobs after
the global financial crisis.  
 Registered foreign residents fell 1.4 percent to 2,186,121
as of Dec. 31 2009, according to a Ministry of Justice report
released July 6. Japan has a population of about 127 million.  
 A 14 percent fall in the number of Brazilian  residents ,
many of whom worked in the car industry and are of Japanese
descent, was one of the reasons for the overall decline,
ministry spokesman Yuji Fukui said.  
 The government last year introduced a  program  paying
unemployed workers with Japanese ancestry 300,000 yen ($3,400)
to return to their home countries. About 20,000 people left
Japan under the program, according to the Labor Ministry.  
 Foreign residents in Japan’s Shizuoka prefecture, where
Honda Motor Co. operates plants, dropped 9.5 percent. The
population in Aichi prefecture, where  Toyota Motor Corp. ’s
headquarters are located, dropped 6 percent.
