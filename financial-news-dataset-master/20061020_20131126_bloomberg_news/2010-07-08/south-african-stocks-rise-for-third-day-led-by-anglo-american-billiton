             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  rose for a third day, climbing 206.27, or 0.8
percent, to 27,061.19.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 AECI Ltd.  (AFE SJ) rallied 3 rand, or 4.6 percent, to 68
rand, the biggest advance in almost 10 months. The explosives
and chemicals company said earnings per share increased by as
much as 135 percent in the six months through June.  
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), Africa’s largest gold
producer, fell for a sixth day, dropping 3.25 rand, or 1.1
percent, to 306.50 rand, the lowest since April 28.  Gold Fields
Ltd.  (GFI SJ), Africa’s second-biggest gold company, lost 1.71
rand, or 1.7 percent, to 97.50 rand.  Harmony Gold Mining Company
Ltd. , Africa’s third-largest producer of the metal, declined
1.11 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 79.90 rand. The precious metal
slumped as much as 0.9 percent to $1,187.30 an ounce.  
 Aquarius Platinum Ltd.  (AQP SJ) dropped 95 cents, or 2.6
percent, to 35.05 rand, extending yesterday’s 5.3 percent slide.
Aquarius may lose 1,500 ounces to 2,000 ounces of output of
platinum group metals at its Marikana mine in South Africa after
five workers were crushed to death by falling rock in an
underground tunnel.  
 Separately, the price of the metal retreated as much as 1
percent to $1,506.50 an ounce.

percent, to 132.05 rand, the highest since June 1. HSBC Holdings
Plc is in the early stages of assessing a bid for Nedbank,
majority owned by Old Mutual, Sky News reported, without
attribution. HSBC appointed Lazard Ltd. to advise on a possible
takeover deal, though there are no current talks between Old
Mutual and potential buyers of its Nedbank stake, Sky said,
without saying where it obtained the information.  Old Mutual Plc 
(OML SJ) increased 37 cents, or 2.9 percent, to 12.94 rand.
