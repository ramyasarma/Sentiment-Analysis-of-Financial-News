             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Morgan
Stanley  profit estimates were lowered by Meredith Whitney
Advisory Group LLC, following similar cuts by other research
analysts as markets fell and business demand shriveled.  
 Whitney cut her estimate for Goldman Sachs’s second-quarter
earnings per share to $1.70 from an earlier forecast of $4.75
and reduced her estimate for Morgan Stanley to 40 cents from 68
cents, according to a report from her New York-based firm.  
 Estimates for  earnings  have tumbled during recent weeks as
stock markets dropped amid a return of risk aversion by
investors. Analysts including  Douglas Sipkin  at Ticonderoga
Securities and  Guy Moszkowski  at Bank of America Corp. have
slashed earnings forecasts because of a lower revenue outlook
and higher costs related to legal expenses and a U.K. bonus tax.  
 Whitney’s cuts are “due to a heinous trading environment”
and “lower than anticipated investment-banking activity,” she
said in the July 7 note to investors.  
 The second quarter “was the worst quarter for debt and
equity underwriting volume in over a year as volatility spiked,
and global equity indices recorded the steepest quarterly
declines since” the fourth quarter 2008, she wrote.  
 The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
is for New York-based Goldman Sachs to earn $2.30 per share in
the second quarter, with forecasts of $1.60 per share to $3.21
per share. Goldman Sachs earned $5.59 per share in the first
quarter of 2010 and $4.93 per share in the second quarter of
2009.  
 Full-Year Estimates  
 Whitney also lowered her estimates for Goldman Sachs’s
third and fourth-quarter earnings to $3.77 and $4.64 from $4.24
and $5.42, respectively. She expects the firm to earn $15.70 in
2010, down from an earlier estimate of $20 a share, while the
2011 forecast was reduced to $19.50 from $22.  
 The average  estimate  of 11 analysts is for Morgan Stanley
to earn 48 cents, with a range of 39 cents to 58 cents. Last
quarter the New York-based firm earned 82 cents a share, while
it lost $1.37 a share a year earlier. Whitney cut her full-year
2010 estimate to $2.62 per share from $2.90 and lowered the 2011
estimate to $3 from $3.05.  
 Whitney has a “neutral” rating on both Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley stock.
