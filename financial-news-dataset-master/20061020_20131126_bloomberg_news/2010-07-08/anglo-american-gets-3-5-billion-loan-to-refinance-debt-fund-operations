             Anglo American Plc , the biggest miner
of platinum, signed a $3.5 billion credit line to refinance debt
and fund its business.  
 The five-year revolving credit will replace a $2.5 billion
facility that expires in 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again
once it’s been repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  
 Anglo American  agreed to pay initial interest of 0.8
percentage point more than benchmark rates on the facility, as
well as a commitment fee of 0.35 percent, according to a person
familiar with the deal. The interest margin changes along with
the company’s credit rating, and moves within a range of 0.6
percentage point to 1.2 percentage points, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  
 The company will pay a utilization fee of 0.15 percentage
point if it uses more than a third of the money, increasing to
0.3 percentage point if it draws down more than two thirds, the
person said.  
 James Wyatt-Tilby , a spokesman for London-based Anglo
American, declined to comment.  
 Lenders including Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Bank
of America Corp., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. and Barclays
Capital participated in the transaction, Bloomberg data show.  
 Standard & Poor’s ranks the London-based company at BBB,
the second-lowest investment grade, while Moody’s Investors
Service rates it one step higher at Baa1.
