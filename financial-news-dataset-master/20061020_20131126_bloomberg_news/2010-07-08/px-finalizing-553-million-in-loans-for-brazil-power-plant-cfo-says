             MPX Energia SA , an energy company
controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , said it is
“finalizing” a 980 million-real ($553 million)  loan  to finance
a power plant in Brazil’s northeast.  
 The 17-year loan for the Pecem II power plant will come
from private banks, Banco do Nordeste do Brasil SA and Brazilian
national development bank BNDES, Chief Financial Officer  Rudolph Ihns  said today in an interview. He declined to disclose the
names of private banks financing a portion of the loan because
the deal has not been signed yet.  
 MPX has already signed contracts to sell the electricity
from three plants it’s constructing in northern Brazil, Ihns
said. Strong growth in Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy,
will boost demand for energy from coal and natural-gas plants,
even as Brazil expands hydroelectric generation, he said.  
 “Brazil will always have space for thermoelectric energy,”
Ihns said in the interview near Sao Luis, in Brazil’s Maranhao
state. “The economy is growing faster than expected.”  
 The Rio de Janeiro-based company expects to get an
environmental license this year to build the Parnaiba natural-
gas plant near an area where MPX is drilling for gas with OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, an oil company also owned by
Batista.  
 MPX  rose 10 centavos, or 0.5 percent, to 21.15 reais in Sao
Paulo trading. The stock has gained 52 percent in the past year.
