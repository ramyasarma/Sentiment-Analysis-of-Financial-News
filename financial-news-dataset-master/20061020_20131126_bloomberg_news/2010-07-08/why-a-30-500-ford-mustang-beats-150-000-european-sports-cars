             I have a $150,000 sports car in my
parking garage, a handcrafted machine produced overseas in
limited numbers. Next to it, I have a U.S.-made Ford Mustang GT,
armadas of which will be sold for as little as $30,500.  
 I tested both the day before, so which to take out today
just for the thrill?  
 “The ‘Stang, please,” I tell Paul and Hector, my trusty
garage guys.  
 Paul raises his eyebrow. Seriously?  
 Times have changed. Changed in a whopping, Big Bang kind of
way. Once hopeless and bumbling,  Ford Motor Co.  is now slinging
out the good stuff faster than  Danny Meyer ’s gourmet hamburger
joint, the Shake Shack. And its new Mustang is about as good as
it gets.  
 I’m reminded why as I aim the sparkling blue hood (the
deep, lustrous paint is called “Kona Blue Metallic”) on my way
out of town.  
 Normally I nurse high-dollar rides over the canyon-sized
cracks and craters in the West Side Highway as if guiding a
colicky baby in a carriage. With the Mustang’s high clearance
and sturdy shocks, I bound over the choppy asphalt. Bulletproof.  
 On today’s just-for-fun itinerary: I’m prowling for open,
winding lanes where the V-8 can have its torque-mad way with the
world. Under full throttle, the brand-new 5.0-liter motor sounds
like Zeus hurling thunderbolts, channeling 412 horsepower and
390 pound-feet of torque.  
 Years ago it was inconceivable to have so much power at
such a bargain price. This base coupe has more kick than the
original V-10-powered Dodge Viper or a Ferrari 360 Modena.  
 Torque Overload  
 And boy does it pull. At a stop light it yanks you,
inexorably, toward the next traffic stop like a leashed bull
mastiff, a kind of torque overload that’s nearly impossible not
to childishly indulge in over and over again.  
 The sound is bright, raw, delicious.  
 As for gas mileage, the V-8 manages 17 city and 26 highway
and can be run on regular gasoline rather than premium with a
slight reduction in power.  
 As driven, my test car was $42,305. It included most of the
convenience and sport options, including navigation, improved
Brembo brakes, 19-inch wheels and an electronic stability
control meant for spirited driving.  
 So equipped, the GT was as much or more fun than any
European or Japanese car at that same price.  
 Hard to believe that the  Mustang  is having its salad days
all over again. Its 50th anniversary will be the pony car’s next
milestone, and the last few generations have shown every long
year. Liver spots have included a cranky chassis, worn-out
engine and middling electronics.  
 Miserly V-8  
 It got a major refresh last year, which helped
considerably, but the V-8 still produced a miserly 315 horses.  
 The 2011 model, also available with a V-6, is minty fresh.
Nicer to look at, better to listen to and easier to live with.
Most surprising, it handles competently on swoopy roads.  
 You see, there have always been those muscle-car motor-
heads who soup up  American steel  just to drag race. It passes
for a good time in certain towns -- I should know, I grew up in
one.  
 What those guys would never do is take a Mustang against a
European sports car on a windy road. Partly because dudes who
listened to Motley Crue and Judas Priest didn’t associate with
those who dug Depeche Mode and the Smiths -- but also because
they’d get their butts kicked.  
 This Mustang is different. It still has an old-school live
rear axle, which is cheap to produce but brutish. Yet engineers
have tuned it to the point of elegance. Steady at speed and yet
nimble in turns, the Mustang shows a lot of poise even on
switchback roads.  
 Fourth of July  
 I easily sustain a super sprint up and down careening
hills, the sound of the 5.0-liters blowing up around me. Even
the Fourth of July wasn’t so cacophonous and lively.  
 While available as a six-speed automatic, let me say this:
If you don’t know how to drive a stick but are thinking of
buying the new Mustang, learn. The six-speed, cue-ball-tipped
stick is wondrous.  
 Finally, the interior. Somebody has figured out that the
Mustang is more than the sum of its engine and exterior. The
seats are comfortable; the two rear seats are somewhat
accommodating, and though the interior is mostly plastic, it
looks good.  
 And when I get lost on my wanders, I quickly punch up my
location on the optional touch-screen navigation system.  
 Budget V-6  
 For a thriftier gas and budget point, there’s the brand-new
3.7-liter V-6, which gets up to 31 mpg highway with an auto
transmission. For a base of $23,000, you still manage a
prodigious 305 horses and 280 pound-feet of torque.  
 I’ve still got several hours before I need to be home. I
don’t really have to keep driving -- I’ve gotten the point --
but, well, seeing as I’m already out here.  
 That European machine in the garage can wait.  
 The 2011 Ford Mustang GT 5.0 at a Glance  
 Engine: 5.0-liter V-8 with 412 horsepower and 390 pound-
feet of torque.  
 Transmission: Six-speed manual or six-speed automatic.  
 Speed: 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds.  
 Gas mileage per gallon: 17 city, 26 highway with manual;
18, 25 with automatic.  
 Price as tested: $42,305.  
 Best features: You can find a little bit of greatness from
every bit of this car.  
 Worst feature: Still a long way away from the magical 30-
mpg mark attained by the V-6.  
 Target buyer: Someone who wants an American icon that
flexes muscles in the right places.
