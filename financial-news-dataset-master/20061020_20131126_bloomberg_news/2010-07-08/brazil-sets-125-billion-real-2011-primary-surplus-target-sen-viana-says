             Brazil set a primary surplus target,
or the surplus before interest payments, of 125 billion reais
for 2011, dropping the existing target as a ratio of gross
domestic product, Senator Tiao Viana, who oversaw the last
version of next year’s guidelines bill, told reporters in
Brasilia.  
 Brazil currently targets a primary surplus of 3.3 percent
of GDP.
