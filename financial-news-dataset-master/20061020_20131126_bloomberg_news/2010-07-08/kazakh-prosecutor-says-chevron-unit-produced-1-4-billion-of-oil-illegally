             Kazakhstan’s Prosecutor General’s
Office found that Chevron Corp.’s biggest venture in the country
produced 212 billion tenge ($1.4 billion) of oil illegally,
according to the economic crimes agency.  
 Prosecutors discovered the violation while investigating
TengizChevroil LLP, the Astana-based agency said in a faxed
statement today. A decision on possible sanctions will follow.  
 The venture may face a fine for “illegal oil production,”
the Central Asian country’s Oil and Gas Ministry said in June.
The ministry had asked the prosecutor’s office to investigate
after Kazakhstan’s biggest oil exporter pumped oil from a depth
that’s not allowed by law, it said.  
 Svetlana Kairgalieva, an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for
TengizChevroil, declined to comment when reached by Bloomberg.  
 Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent,
Kazakhstan’s state-run KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent
and Lukarco, owned by Russia’s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent.
