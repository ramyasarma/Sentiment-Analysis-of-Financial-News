             The euro stayed higher against the
dollar and the yen after European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said that policy rates remain “appropriate.”  
 The euro was 0.3 percent higher at $1.2678 as of 1:36 p.m.
in London, and climbed 0.8 percent to 111.76 yen.  
 The EBC earlier held its benchmark interest rate at a
record-low 1 percent.
