             Dubai Holding Commercial Operations
Group LLC, a real estate and hospitality group owned by the
emirate’s ruler, got a two-month extension on a $555 million
revolving credit facility that matures this month.  
 The facility was extended at “commercial terms” and is
needed to “to facilitate the finalization of the documentation
to renew the facility,” Dubai Holding Commercial Operations
said in a statement posted on the Nasdaq Dubai website today.  
 Dubai Holding Commercial on June 30 had its debt ratings
cut by Moody’s Investors Service from B1 to B2, the fifth-
highest non-investment grade. The ratings remain under review
for further possible downgrade, according to Moody’s.  
 Dubai Holding Commercial reported a full-year loss of 22.8
billion dirhams ($6.2 billion) on June 1, compared with a year-
earlier profit of 10 billion dirhams after property prices
plunged in the Gulf’s trade and tourism hub. Impairment charges
for the year surged to 22.5 billion dirhams from 7.6 billion
dirhams in 2008, while revenue dropped to 9.5 billion dirhams
from 13.2 billion dirhams.  
 Dubai Holding LLC, Dubai Holding Commercial’s parent, and
its units owe banks $12 billion and have begun talks to roll
over some loans, a person with knowledge of the matter said on
May 10, declining to be identified because of company policy.
Almost three-fourths of the loans have been racked up by Dubai
Holding’s two investment companies, Dubai Group LLC and Dubai
International Capital LLC, said the person.
