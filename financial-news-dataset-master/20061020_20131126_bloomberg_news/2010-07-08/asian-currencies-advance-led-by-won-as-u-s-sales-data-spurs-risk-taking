             Asian  currencies approached a two-
week high, led by gains in South Korea’s won and Malaysia’s
ringgit, after a report suggesting U.S. consumers are spending
more freely helped shore up demand for riskier assets.  
 The won climbed the most this month and the  MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index  of stocks rose following a 3.1 percent rally in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Malaysia today reported a
pickup in industrial output before a central bank policy meeting
that may lead to the country’s third interest-rate increase of
the year. Korean policy makers will decide tomorrow whether to
raise borrowing costs from a record-low 2 percent.  
 “Asian growth is more resilient than people thought and
the prospect for fund inflows into emerging markets remains
undiminished,” said  Julian Chow , head of Asian fixed-income and
foreign exchange at AmInvestment Management Sdn. in Kuala Lumpur.
“For the ringgit and regional currencies, greed is stronger
than fear today.”  
 The won appreciated 1.1 percent to 1,209.40 per dollar as
of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, the most since June 28, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ringgit strengthened 0.5
percent to 3.2040. Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to
NT$32.185, paring a 0.6 percent move. The Philippine peso
advanced 0.2 percent to 46.445.  
 The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, rose for a
third day. The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index  climbed 1.7 percent.  
 ‘Improved Sentiment’  
 The New York-based International Council of Shopping
Centers yesterday estimated retailers’ sales in the U.S. grew at
an average monthly rate of 4 percent in the five months through
June, the most in four years. The International Monetary Fund
yesterday raised its 2010 forecast for global economic growth to
4.6 percent, from an April projection of 4.2 percent.  
 The U.S. sales data “improved sentiment for stocks and
emerging-market assets,” said  Chatchawan Jumruswittayawong , a
foreign-exchange trader at Bank of Ayudhya Pcl in Bangkok.  
 Malaysia’s  industrial production  rose 12.5 percent from a
year earlier in May, following a 10.7 percent increase the
previous month, a government report showed. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg predicted a 10.5 percent gain. Half of the 20
forecasts in a separate poll are for Bank Negara Malaysia to
raise its overnight policy rate by a quarter of a percentage
point today to 2.75 percent.  
 Thai Confidence  
 Four of 14 economists in another survey said they expect
the Bank of Korea to lift its seven-day repurchase rate by a
quarter-point, while the rest forecast no change.  Economic
expansion  accelerated to a seven-year high of 8.1 percent in the
first quarter and the IMF this week raised its 2010 growth
forecast for South Korea, saying monetary policy is “somewhat
beyond what is necessary to support the recovery.”  
 The Thai baht advanced 0.2 percent to 32.43, headed for its
best day in three weeks. Consumer confidence rose for a second
month in June, the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce
said in Bangkok today. Seven of 12 economists predicted a rate
increase on July 14.  
 Elsewhere, the Indonesian rupiah climbed 0.2 percent to
9,070 per dollar and Singapore’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to
S$1.3835, strengthening for a fifth straight day. China’s yuan
traded at 6.7756, little changed from 6.7772 yesterday.
