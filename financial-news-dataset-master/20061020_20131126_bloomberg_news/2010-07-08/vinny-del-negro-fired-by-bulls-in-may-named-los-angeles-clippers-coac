             Vinny Del Negro , who took the Chicago
Bulls to the National Basketball Association playoffs the past
two years, was named coach of the Los Angeles Clippers.  
 Del Negro succeeds  Kim Hughes , who became interim coach in
February after seven seasons as an assistant. Hughes was fired
in April after taking the job when  Mike Dunleavy  resigned.  
 The Clippers finished 12th in the Western Conference last
year, 28 games behind the Los Angeles Lakers, with a 29-53
record.  
 Del Negro was fired May 4 after the Bulls lost in the first
round of the 2010 playoffs to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 43-
year-old had a 82-82 record in two seasons with Chicago.  
 As a player, Del Negro averaged 9.1 points in 771 regular-
season NBA games and 8.8 points in 54 playoff appearances. He
was drafted by the Sacramento Kings in 1988 and retired in 2002.
