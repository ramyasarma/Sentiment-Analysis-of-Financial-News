             Travelers Cos. , the insurer in the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average , was told to halt an ad the Texas
attorney general said misleads consumers about the risk of
losing their homes if they have inadequate auto coverage.  
 Attorney General  Greg Abbott  demanded that the
“deceptive” advertisement from the insurer be removed from all
television markets and print media in the state, according to an
e-mailed statement from his office today.  
 Each airing of the ad could cost New York-based Travelers
$20,000 in civil penalties, based on the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices Act, Abbott said. State law protects Texans from
losing their homes because of uninsured losses from a traffic
accident, he said.  
 “Because the state already protects homeowners, it is
improper for Travelers to scare Texans into buying insurance
they may not need,” Abbott said in the statement.  
 A version of the ad provided by the attorney general
depicts a man driving his home on the highway, then crashing.
“A crash might impact more than your car,” it says. “Make
sure you’re properly covered, so when you’re driving your car
you’re not risking your house.”  
 Shane Boyd , a spokesman for Travelers, didn’t immediately
return a call for comment.
