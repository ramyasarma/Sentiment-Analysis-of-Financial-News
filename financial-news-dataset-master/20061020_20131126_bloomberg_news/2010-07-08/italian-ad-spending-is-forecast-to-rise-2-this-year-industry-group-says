             Italy’s advertising spending is
forecast to rise 2 percent this year, advertisers’ group UPA
said in a statement handed to reporters in Milan.  
 UPA has more than 400 member companies, which account for
about 85 percent of ad spending in Italy. Ad spending in Italy
fell 13 percent to about 8 billion euros ($10.1 billion) last
year as companies cut spending amid the recession.
