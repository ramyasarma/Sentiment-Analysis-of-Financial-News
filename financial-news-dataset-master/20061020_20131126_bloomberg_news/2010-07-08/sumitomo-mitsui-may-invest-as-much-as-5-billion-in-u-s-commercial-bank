             Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. ,
Japan’s second-largest bank by market value, may spend as much
as $5 billion buying a stake in a U.S. commercial lender in the
next three years, a top executive said.  
 “We can’t overlook the U.S. market in terms of stable
returns and size,” said  Hiroshi Minoura , head of international
banking at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “We need to push
forward with investments, including acquisitions, that allow us
to capture a large volume of assets.”  
 Sumitomo Mitsui, which agreed to invest in India’s  Kotak
Mahindra Bank Ltd.  last month, is studying about 20 U.S. banks,
Minoura said in a July 7 interview. An acquisition in the
world’s largest economy would support Sumitomo Mitsui President
 Teisuke Kitayama ’s goal of getting 30 percent of banking profit
from  clients overseas  within three years, up from 20 percent
last fiscal year.  
 Minoura said Sumitomo Mitsui won’t be able to meet that
target “organically.” He said he’ll likely target banks in the
U.S. Midwest or East Coast, declining to name any companies.
Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui raised 1.8 trillion yen ($20 billion)
in two  stock sales  since June 2009 to replenish capital.  
 U.S. banks that are weak or nominally profitable would be
more willing to sell a stake, said  Jeff Davis , an analyst at
Guggenheim Securities LLC.  
 Possible Targets  
 Sumitomo Mitsui may consider  Huntington Bancshares Inc. ,
KeyCorp or Fifth Third Bancorp as potential targets, Davis said,
as the three Ohio-based banks are among those that have yet to
repay aid from the U.S. Treasury Department’s bank-bailout
program. Dallas-based  Comerica Inc. , which repaid $2.25 billion
in rescue funds, may also be a candidate, he said.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui fell 2.3 percent to 2,617 yen as of 10:03
a.m. in Tokyo Stock Exchange trading. The shares have fallen 26
percent in the past year.  
 While the bank isn’t in any detailed talks now, the size of
an investment would probably be $1.5 billion to $5 billion,
depending on the target’s  size , said Minoura, 54.  
 “It doesn’t necessarily mean that the size is 100
percent,” he said. “It may be 20 percent and it may be 100
percent.” Minoura said he’d prefer to buy a majority stake,
though a minority investment is also a possibility.  
 ‘Ideal Target’  
 “Probably the ideal target would be one that needs
additional capital, because they’re more likely to say yes,”
said Davis, who predicted in July 2008 that the U.S. would
experience a “couple hundred” bank failures. Regulators have
closed more than [bn:URL= http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html   
 http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html ] 240 banks [] since then.  
 William Murschel , a spokesman for KeyCorp, declined to
comment. Maureen Brown, a spokeswoman for Huntington, and  Debra DeCourcy  of Fifth Third didn’t immediately respond to messages
seeking comment.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui operates commercial banking offices in Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Houston, according to the bank’s
website. Its U.S. headquarters are located in New York.  
 Japanese banks are targeting overseas markets including the
U.S. to compensate for slumping credit demand at home.  Bank
lending  fell for a seventh straight month in June, the Bank of
Japan said yesterday.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest
publicly traded bank, spent about $3.6 billion in 2008 to take
full control of San Francisco-based UnionBanCal Corp. In April,
UnionBanCal bought Washington-based Frontier Bank and California
lender Tamalpais Bank in agreements with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.  
 Stricken Western banks  
 Japan’s largest lenders also poured cash into stricken
Western banks in 2008 as the credit crunch deepened. Sumitomo
Mitsui invested 500 million pounds ($760 million) in Barclays
Plc in July 2008; Mitsubishi UFJ paid $9 billion for a stake in
Morgan Stanley; and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. invested $1.2
billion in Merrill Lynch & Co. that year.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui passed on opportunities to acquire Wachovia
Corp. and Washington Mutual Inc. during the financial crisis,
said Minoura. Wachovia was bought by Wells Fargo & Co. for $12.7
billion in 2008 and Washington Mutual’s banking operations were
sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Minoura spent 18 years in the U.S. working for Sumitomo
Mitsui and predecessor banks. He became chief of the company’s
international operations in April.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui returned to profit in the fiscal year ended
March 31 and forecast net income will rise 25 percent to 340
billion yen this fiscal year. That would still be less than half
of what the bank earned in the 12 months through March 2006.  
 The company said June 30 it will pay 13.7 billion rupees
($292 million) for a 4.5 percent stake in Kotak Mahindra, owner
of India’s largest securities firm. Sumitomo Mitsui invested
about $180 million in Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia Ltd. in
January.  
 Other overseas acquisitions include the 2008 purchase of a
15 percent stake in Vietnam Export-Import Commercial Joint-Stock
Bank for about $225 million and an investment in Korea’s KB
Financial Group Inc. the same year.
