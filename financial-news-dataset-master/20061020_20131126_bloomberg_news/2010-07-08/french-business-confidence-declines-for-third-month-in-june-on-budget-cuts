             French business confidence declined
for a third month in June on concern that budget cuts across
Europe may slow consumer demand.  
 The  Bank of France’s Business Sentiment Indicator  for
manufacturers declined to 100 from 101 in May, the Paris-based
central bank said today in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Germany and the U.K. have both announced additional
deficit-reduction measures in recent weeks and in France,
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has pledged to reduce the government
shortfall next year. The savings plans may dent economic growth
as Europe recovers from its worst recession in 60 years and a
debt crisis that led to a 750 billion-euro ($946 billion) rescue
package being agreed on in May.  
 “The euro-zone debt crisis and governments’ austerity
announcements are weighing on sentiment,” said  Joost Beaumont ,
an economist at ABN Amro Bank in Amsterdam.  
 The Bank of France said today that the country’s economy
will expanded about 0.4 percent in the second quarter, compared
with a previous forecast of 0.5 percent.
