             Australia’s dollar may rise versus
its Canadian counterpart as Chinese growth benefits the South
Pacific nation while the North American country is more at risk
to a U.S. slowdown, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  
 Investors should buy Australia’s dollar, targeting gains to
95 Canadian cents, and exit the trade if it closes below 88.5
Canadian cents, Goldman analysts including London-based Fiona
Lake wrote in a note to clients.  
 The Australian dollar surged today as the nation added
three times as many workers in June as economists had estimated,
boosting prospects the Reserve Bank of Australia will resume
raising interest rates.  
 “Today’s strong labor market data has reversed the cuts
previously priced by the market,” the analysts wrote. Goldman
expects Australia will raise its key rate, now at 4.5 percent,
by 25 basis points in 2010, with "75 basis points more
tightening in 2011.’’  
 Australia’s employment rolls rose by 45,900 in June, a
statistics bureau report showed today. The median estimate of 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for an increase of
15,000. The jobless rate held at 5.1 percent.  
 The Australian dollar advanced to 91.30 Canadian cents as
of 3:48 p.m. in Sydney, from 90.47 cents yesterday in New York.  
 “We think the downside risks may not be adequately
reflected in the Canadian dollar yet, especially given Canada’s
close trade links to the U.S.,” according to the note.
