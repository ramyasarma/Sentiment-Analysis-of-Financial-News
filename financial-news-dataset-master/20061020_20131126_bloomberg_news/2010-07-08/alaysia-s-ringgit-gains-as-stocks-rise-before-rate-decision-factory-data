             Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened the
most in a week before a government report today that may show
manufacturers increased production for a sixth month and policy
makers meet to set interest rates.  
 The currency climbed to a two-week high and stocks rose as
 industrial production  probably increased 10.5 percent in May
from a year earlier, versus a 10.1 percent gain in April,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Economists are divided on
whether Bank Negara Malaysia will hold or raise borrowing costs
when it announces the decision at 6 p.m. local time.  
 “Asian growth is more resilient than people were worried
about and the prospect for fund inflows into emerging markets
remains undiminished,” said  Julian Chow , head of Asian fixed-
income and foreign exchange at AmInvestment Management Sdn. in
Kuala Lumpur. “For the ringgit and regional currencies, greed
is stronger than fear today.”  
 The ringgit gained 0.7 percent to 3.1980 per dollar as of
9:52 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur and reached 3.1943, the highest level
since June 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency may appreciate to 3.18 by year end, Chow said, matching
the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index  of shares rose 1.7 percent and
the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index jumped as much as 0.4 percent.  
 Half of 20 economists predicted Bank Negara will keep its
 overnight rate  at 2.5 percent, while the rest forecast an
increase to 2.75 percent, a Bloomberg survey shows. The central
bank has lifted its benchmark rate twice this year from a record
low 2 percent.  
 Overseas investors held 93.8 billion ringgit ($29.3 billion)
of all types of ringgit-denominated debt at the end of May, up
from 69.2 billion ringgit at the end of 2009, according to
central bank  statistics . Their stake in government bonds rose to
57.9 billion ringgit from 40.9 billion ringgit over the same
period.
