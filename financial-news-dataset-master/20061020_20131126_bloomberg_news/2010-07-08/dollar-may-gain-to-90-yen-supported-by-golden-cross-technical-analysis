             The dollar may rise to 90 yen, the
highest level since June 23, if it breaks above key levels
concentrated around 88 yen to 89 yen on technical charts,
according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  
 The greenback, which reached a seven-month low of 86.97 yen
on July 1, looks to have bottomed and its five-day moving
average has turned upward, said  Teppei Ino , a Tokyo-based
analyst at the unit of Japan’s largest banking group.  
 “Though the path from the upper 88 yen level will not be
easy, the dollar will strengthen against the yen, supported by
the five-day moving average,” he said.  
 The dollar’s “battle line” in July is 88.86 yen, a 23.6
percent retracement of a decline from a high of 94.99 yen on May
5 to the July 1 low, based on a series of numbers known as the
Fibonacci sequence, Ino said. Other targets are the 21-day
moving average, which is currently at 89.65 yen, as well as
90.03 yen, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, he said.  
 Should the five-day moving average of the U.S. currency
cross above the 21-day line, forming a “golden cross,” that
would reinforce the dollar’s upward trend, Ino said. The 200-day
average of 90.78 yen will be on the horizon, he said.  
 The dollar traded at 88.42 yen as of 7:57 a.m. in Tokyo.  
 A so-called golden cross forms when a short-term average
passes over a longer-term one. In technical analysis, investors
and analysts study charts of trading patterns and prices to
forecast changes in a security, commodity, currency or index.
