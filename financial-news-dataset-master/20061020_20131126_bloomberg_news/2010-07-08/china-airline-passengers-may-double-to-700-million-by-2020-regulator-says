             China’s number of airline passengers
may more than double to 700 million a year by 2020 as economic
growth spurs travel, according to the nation’s aviation
regulator.  
 This year, passenger numbers may total 266 million,  Liu Shaocheng , director of policy research at the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, said today at a conference in Beijing.
The tally may reach 1.5 billion by 2030, he said.  
 The world’s most populous nation also plans to open 10 new
airports this year as rising wages and development in hinterland
regions stoke travel in smaller cities. By 2020, the country may
have more than 250 airports compared with an expected 176 at the
end of this year, Liu said.  
 “Somewhere between 2020 and 2030, China will become the
largest aviation market in the world,” said Airbus SAS China
President Laurence Barron. “We are taking this country very,
very seriously.”  
 The construction of high-speed railways in China and
concerns about pollution may curb the long-term growth of
aviation, Liu said.
