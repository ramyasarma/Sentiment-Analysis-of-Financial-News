             Kenya agreed to increase the salaries
of police officers by about a quarter in an effort to improve
morale and help motivate them to fight crime,  Business Daily 
reported, citing Internal Security Minister  George Saitoti .  
 Junior officers will get a 28 percent pay rise while senior
officials will earn 25 percent more, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, without giving the salary amounts.  
 The East African nation’s government also plans to provide
police with more equipment, including 1,000 new vehicles,
closed-circuit television cameras and a forensic laboratory in
the capital Nairobi, Business Daily said.
