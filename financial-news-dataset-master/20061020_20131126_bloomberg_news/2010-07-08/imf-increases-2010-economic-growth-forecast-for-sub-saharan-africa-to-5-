             The  International Monetary Fund 
raised its 2010 growth forecast for sub-Saharan Africa as global
trade rebounded.  
 The region’s economy will expand 5 percent, compared with
an April forecast of 4.7 percent, the Washington-based lender
said in its World Economic Outlook update on its website today.
The forecast for 2011 was left unchanged at 5.9 percent.  
 “Overall, macroeconomic developments during much of the
spring confirmed expectations of a modest but steady recovery in
most advanced economies and strong growth in many emerging and
developing economies,” the IMF said. “Nevertheless, recent
turbulence in financial markets, reflecting a drop in confidence
about fiscal sustainability, policy responses, and future growth
prospects, has cast a cloud over the outlook.”  
 On June 9, the World Bank said it expects sub-Saharan
Africa’s economy to expand 4.5 percent this year, and 5.1
percent next year.
