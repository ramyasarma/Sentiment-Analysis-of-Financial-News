             Severe thunderstorm warnings have
been issued for parts of Western Australia, with wind gusts of
up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) an hour expected, the state’s
fire and emergency services authority said.  
 The warning, issued for today and tomorrow, affects the
southwest region of the state from Kalbarri to Albany, including
the  capital, Perth , the authority said in an e-mailed statement.
The  Bureau of Meteorology  has advised the thunderstorms may be
accompanied by damaging winds and hail that may make travelling
unsafe, it said.  
 Areas under threat include wheat-growing regions, which
according to the state’s agriculture department had below-
average rainfall in the April to June quarter, contributing to a
lower than previously expected grain crop this year.  
 Western Australia, about four times the size of France,
accounts for 62 percent of the nation’s mineral production, 73
percent of natural gas and 64 percent of crude oil and
condensate. The majority of the state’s mineral and energy
projects aren’t in the area affected by the severe weather
warnings.
