             The price of the 10-year Treasury
note future should resume its medium-term upward pattern after
it extends its move downward, according to strategists at
Societe General SA who study charts of trading patterns and
prices to forecast changes.  
 The price reached as low as 121 26.5/32 today, the lowest
since June 28, after closing yesterday at 122 14/32. The so-
called lead contract, which now expires in September, is down
nearly a percentage point from 123 1/32 on July 1. The price
pared earlier declines to trade at 122 1/32.  
 The break below 122 5/32 support calls “for a dip to the
121 25/32 support area, or even to the 121 1/32-4/32 region,
before the 10-year Treasury note heads north again,” Societe
Generale analysts including  Hugues Naka  in Paris wrote in a
research report today.  
 Support is an area on charts where buy orders may be
clustered, making further price decreases more difficult. At
resistance, sell orders may be clustered.  
 The 10-year cash Treasury note  yield , which moves in
opposite direction of its price, rose above 3 percent for the
first time this month after data showing a bigger-than-forecast
drop in first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week
damped bonds’ haven appeal. The yield was 3.02 percent at 1:02
p.m. in New York.  
 The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to
454,000. The International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for
global growth this year.  
 Any Treasury notes with a maturity of between 6 1/2 years
and 10 years from the first day of the delivery month may be
delivered into the 10-year note contract. U.S. bond and note
futures trade on the Chicago Board of Trade, which is part of
the  CME Group Inc.,  the world’s largest futures market.
