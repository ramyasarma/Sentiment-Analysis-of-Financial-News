             China’s property market may be a
“little bit” overvalued, Fang Xinghai, director general of
Shanghai’s financial services offices, said.  
 Prices of real estate in China don’t face a collapse, Fang
said in an interview on Bloomberg television. He called real
estate China’s “best performing asset class.”
