             Saudi Arabia’s mortgage law will be
submitted to  King Abdullah  for approval after the Shura Council
completes its discussions next week, a senior member of the
Council told Bloomberg.  
 The country has never had legislation covering mortgage and
property finance and the law will regulate the use of mortgages,
including registration and providing court authority over their
use. It will mean finance leasing companies must be incorporated
and regulated.  
 “This will be the last time for the Shura Council to ever
discuss the mortgage law before the King gives his final word on
it,” Saad Mariq, Deputy Chairman of the Financial Committee at
the council, said in an interview.  
 The Shura will discuss the mortgage legislation along with
four other laws that will regulate lending to the real estate
industry. All four laws will then be submitted to the King, he
added.  
 The cabinet sent back the proposed mortgage law to the
council recently after it disagreed with some of the provisions
approved earlier by the Shura.  
 Mariq said that according to the Saudi constitution, if the
cabinet disapproves of any proposed bill after it’s approved by
the Shura, then it will be submitted directly to the King for a
final ruling on it without referring to the cabinet again.
