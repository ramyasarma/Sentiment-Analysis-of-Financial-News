             The head of the Argentine agency
dedicated to fighting money laundering asked prosecutors to
investigate whether  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and three companies
manipulated prices of public share offerings, the agency said in
a statement.  
 Jose Sbatella, the head of Argentina’s Financial
Information Unit, sought a probe into share sales by  Grupo
Clarin SA ,  Banco Patagonia SA  and  Consultatio SA  after receiving
testimony from former JPMorgan employee  Hernan Arbizu , the
statement said.  
 JPMorgan participated in share sales by the three Buenos
Aires-based companies, the statement added.  
 Arbizu, an Argentine, fled the U.S. in 2008 after being
indicted for embezzlement. He has been sued by the bank for
allegedly stealing money from a client account and taking
confidential information about customers. Arbizu said in an
interview in Buenos Aires last year that the charges against him
are true and that he didn’t profit from the transactions.  
 “The complaint has no grounds,” Clarin said by e-mail.
“The offerings were made in London and Buenos Aires according
to all international norms.”  
 “We hope this ends quickly to make clear we acted
according to the law,”  Eduardo Costantini , chairman of
Consultatio, said in a phone interview today.  
 JPMorgan spokesman  Brian Marchiony  and Banco Patagonia
spokeswoman Alejandra Prat declined to comment to Bloomberg.
