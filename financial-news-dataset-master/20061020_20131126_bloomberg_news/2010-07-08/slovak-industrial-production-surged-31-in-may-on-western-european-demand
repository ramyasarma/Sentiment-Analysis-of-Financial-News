             Slovak industrial production rose at
the fastest annual pace since at least 2004 in May as a recovery
in western Europe fueled demand for cars and electronics from
the newest euro member.  
 Output  rose 31 percent from a year ago, a seventh
consecutive increase, after advancing 21 percent in the previous
month, the Bratislava-based  Slovak Statistical Office  said
today. The advances follow a 14.6 percent decline in output in
2009.  
 The export-oriented economy, which adopted the euro in
January 2009, is benefiting from a recovery in western Europe,
its main trading partner. Production of cars rose 56.3 percent
from May 2009, while production of electronics was up 85.3
percent.  
 Construction  output dropped an annual 8.9 percent in May,
following a 1.2 percent decline in the previous month, the
office also said today.
