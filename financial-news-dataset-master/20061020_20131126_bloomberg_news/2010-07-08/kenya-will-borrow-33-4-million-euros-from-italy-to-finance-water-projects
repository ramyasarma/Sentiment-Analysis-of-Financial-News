             Kenya will borrow 33.4 million euros
($42.2 million) from Italy to provide reliable sources of clean
water to residents in rural parts of the Rift Valley and Eastern
province, Kenyan Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said.  
 In the Rift Valley, the financing will be used to help
increase to 50,000 people from 12,000 the number being served by
the Kirandich dam, Kenyatta told reporters today in the capital,
Nairobi.  
 The loan from the Italian government will also go toward
expanding water distribution in rural areas of Eastern province
and building a waste-management plant in the town of Mwingi, he
said.
