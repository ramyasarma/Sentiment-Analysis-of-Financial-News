             The National Basketball Association
increased the salary cap for the 2010-11 season by 0.6 percent
to $58.04 million.  
 Last year, the league lowered the amount teams can spend on
pay to $57.7 million from $58.68 million the previous season.  
 Teams will be levied a $1 tax for every $1 they spend on
pay above $70.31 million, up from $69.92 million last season,
the NBA said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The cap and tax level go into effect at 12:01 a.m. New York
time, when teams can begin signing free agents and making
trades.  
 Teams that exceed the salary cap can still sign one or more
players for a total of $5.77 million under the so-called mid-
level exception, while the minimum team salary is $43.5 million,
or 75 percent of the salary cap.
