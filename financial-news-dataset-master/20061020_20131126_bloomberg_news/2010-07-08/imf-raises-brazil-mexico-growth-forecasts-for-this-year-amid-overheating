             The International Monetary Fund
raised its forecasts for Brazil’s and Mexico’s economic growth
this year while noting that Latin American economies “face some
risk of overheating.”  
 Brazil, the region’s largest economy, may grow 7.1 percent
this year, up from a previous prediction of 5.5 percent, the IMF
said today in a report. Mexico, Latin America’s second-biggest
economy, will expand 4.5 percent in 2010, revised from a
previous estimate for 4.2 percent expansion, the report said.  
 Brazil’s economic growth will slow to 4.2 percent next
year, below the world average of 4.3 percent, the IMF said.  
 Economic growth is being supported by a rise in worldwide
trade that benefits countries that export commodities, the IMF
said. Mexico is the largest oil producer in Latin America, while
Brazil is the world’s biggest coffee, sugar and beef producer.  
 Capital flows to emerging markets may increase as faster
growth and low debt make them more attractive to investors than
some advanced economies, the report said.
