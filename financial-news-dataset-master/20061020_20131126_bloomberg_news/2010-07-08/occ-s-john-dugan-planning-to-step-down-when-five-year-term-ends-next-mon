             Comptroller of the Currency  John Dugan  will step down when his five-year term as national bank
supervisor ends next month, he said today in a letter to
President  Barack Obama .  
 “Through two administrations and under three secretaries
of the Treasury, I have had the great honor of serving as the
29th Comptroller of the Currency,” Dugan said in the  letter 
posted on OCC’s website. “My term will soon come to an end, and
it is my intention to leave office on August 14, 2010.”  
 Dugan, a Republican appointee who was retained when
Democrat Obama took office in January 2009, was part of the
group of regulators who helped steer the U.S. through the worst
economic crisis since the Great Depression. Dugan and his agency
were involved in crafting and implementing rescue efforts
including the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.  
 “During the darkest days of the crisis nearly two years
ago, the very viability of the  banking system  seemed in
question,” Dugan said in his letter. “As I prepare to take my
leave, I am pleased to report that the condition of the national
banking system is much, much improved.”  
 Before being appointed as comptroller by President  George W. Bush  in 2005, Dugan, 55, was a partner in the law firm
 Covington & Burling LLP . He was an assistant Treasury secretary
under President  George H.W. Bush  and also served as a staff
member on Capitol Hill.
