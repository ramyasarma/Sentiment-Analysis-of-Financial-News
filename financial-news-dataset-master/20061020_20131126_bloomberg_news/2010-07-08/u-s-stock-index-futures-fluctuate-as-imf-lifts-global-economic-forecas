             U.S. stock-index futures fluctuated
as European equities rose for a third day after the
International Monetary Fund increased its estimate for global
economic growth.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September slipped less than 0.1 percent to 1,059.2 at 8:13 a.m.
in New York after slumping as much as 0.4 percent earlier. Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures rose 7 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 9,987.  
 The S&P 500 had its biggest one-day rally in six weeks
yesterday, surging 3.1 percent, as banks advanced and retail-
sales growth bolstered optimism that consumer spending is
weathering a drop in confidence.
