             Nakheel PJSC, the builder of palm-
shaped islands off Dubai’s coast, plans to issue bonds in mid-
July to settle debt to contractors, Al-Bayan reported citing the
chairman of the United Arab Emirates’ Contractors Association,
Ahmed Saif Belhasa.  
 The company said in March that trade creditors would be
offered 100 percent recovery of their claims -- 40 percent
through a cash payment and 60 percent through a publicly
tradable Islamic bond, paying 10 percent return annually.  ,    
 Nakheel said on June 30 it started making 40 percent cash
payment to its biggest contractors after initial payments to 
trade creditors with claims of 500,000 dirhams or less.
