             Royal Bank of Canada and Pictet &
Cie. last year joined a ranking of the world’s 10 biggest wealth
managers, which is still headed by  Bank of America Corp.  and UBS
AG, according to  Scorpio Partnership .  
 Royal Bank of Canada was seventh on the list with $379
billion of fee-based assets under management, while Geneva’s
Pictet managed $243 billion at the end of December, London-based
Scorpio said in a study published today. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc. dropped out of the top 10.  
 Assets under management rose 17 percent to $16.5 trillion
at the nearly 230 financial institutions analyzed with the
wealthy holding another $10 trillion that isn’t currently
banked, Scorpio said. Net new money inflows declined 60 percent
to a median of $900 million per firm, while rising costs are
crimping earnings and leaving the business models of many wealth
managers “in the balance,” said Scorpio.  
 “The premier league of wealth managers have virtually all
benefited from strong asset management performance,” Stephen
Wall, a director at Scorpio, said in the report. “Banks outside
the top 100 are starting to show signs of  prolonged suffering  as
net new money and real profits are in decline.”  
 Cost-to-income ratios climbed to an average of 78.2 percent
in 2009, from 72.4 percent the previous year, Scorpio said.  
 ‘Still Misfiring’  
 “The wealth management industry is still misfiring for
many,” said Scorpio Managing Partner  Sebastian Dovey . “There
are strong signs of wealth creation even in these complex
markets and yet new clients are still holding back from opening
accounts with the industry.”  
 The number of millionaire households, or those with at
least $1 million in investable assets excluding primary
residences, expanded to 10 million globally in 2009 from 8.6
million a year earlier, according to a Merrill Lynch and
Capgemini report last month.  
 Following is a table of the world’s biggest wealth
managers, based on end-2009 data from the Scorpio survey. The 10
banks collectively manage $8.73 trillion, according to the
study.
