             Oil headed for its biggest weekly
gain in six in New York as declining U.S.  inventories  and a drop
in jobless claims bolstered speculation the economic recovery in
the world’s biggest energy consumer is on track.  
 Crude climbed for a third day after an Energy Department
report yesterday showed stockpiles dropped 4.96 million barrels
last week, the most since September. The Labor Department said
the number of Americans applying for weekly  unemployment
benefits  fell by 21,000, more than the median forecast from
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “There’s optimism out there,” said  Jonathan Barratt ,
managing director at Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney.
“The draws in stockpiles were encouraging. I expect prices to
move up to $80, but we still need more signs of recovery.”  
 Crude for August delivery rose as much as 51 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $75.95 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $75.92 at 2:12 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract gained $1.37, or 1.9
percent, to $75.44, the highest settlement this month. Oil is
set for a 5.2 percent increase this week, the most since May 28.
Futures have climbed 26 percent from a year ago.  
 U.S. crude supplies fell to 358.2 million barrels in the
week ended July 2, the lowest in 10 weeks, according to the
Energy Department report. Imports slipped and refiners increased
 operating rates  to 89.8 percent of capacity, the highest weekly
average since January 2008.  
 Fuel  demand  rose 3.2 percent to 19.6 million barrels a day,
the highest since May 28, the department said.  
 Job Market  
 Initial jobless claims dropped to an eight-week low of
454,000, a level that indicated improvement in the U.S. job
market may take time to develop. A Labor Department report last
week showed companies in June hired fewer workers than forecast.  
 Germany’s  industrial production climbed in May as the
global recovery fueled demand for goods from Europe’s largest
economy. Production rose 2.6 percent, more than double a revised
1.2 percent in April, the Economy Ministry said yesterday.  
 The global economy will grow 4.6 percent in 2010, the
biggest expansion since 2007, the International Monetary Fund
said yesterday in revisions to its World Economic Outlook.  
 “If we see more reports like this IMF one, that could give
us the impetus to move past the $80 level,” Barratt said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television. “As to when we break
through it we need to see more economic data that suggest the
economy is really firing.”  
 Brent crude for August delivery rose as much as 44 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $75.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was at $75.11 at 2:12 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, the contract gained $1.20, or 1.6 percent, to
$74.71, the highest settlement this month.  
 Drilling Moratorium  
 The U.S. government’s request to reinstate a deepwater oil-
drilling moratorium while it challenges a lower-court order
rejecting the ban was denied by a federal appeals panel.  
 The Obama administration sought to delay an order by U.S.
District Judge  Martin Feldman  that scrapped the six-month ban,
imposed May 27 after the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater
Horizon oil rig in April. The three-judge panel of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the stay after a
hearing yesterday in New Orleans.  
 Oil may rise next week after the IMF upgraded its global
economic outlook and as U.S. supplies dropped to a two-month low,
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Twenty of 38 analysts and traders, or 53 percent, forecast
crude will increase through July 16. Ten respondents, or 26
percent, predicted futures will be little changed and eight saw
a decrease. Last week 53 percent of survey respondents forecast
a price drop.
