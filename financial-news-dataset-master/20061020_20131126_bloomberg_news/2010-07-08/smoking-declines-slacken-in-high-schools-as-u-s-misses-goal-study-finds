             Smoking among high school students
isn’t declining as fast as it did a decade ago, causing the U.S.
to miss its goal for reducing the rate of cigarette use among
those teenagers, a study found.  
 Smoking fell to about 20 percent of students in 2009 from
22 percent in 2003, according to a study released today by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The decline was
slower than the drop from 36 percent in 1997. The U.S. Health
Department had aimed for current smokers to make up 16 percent
or less of students by this year.  
 Teen smoking increased during most of the 1990s, fueled by
advertising and price discounts on popular teen brands,
according to the CDC. Smoking rates declined in the late 1990s
and early 2000s because of restrictions on promotions, anti-
smoking programs led by “ The Truth ” ad campaign, and higher
cigarette taxes, and such efforts should be increased, according
to the authors of today’s report.  
 “It’s discouraging to see that current smoking did not
continue to decline more rapidly,” said  Thomas Frieden , head of
the Atlanta-based CDC, in an e-mailed statement. “Smoking is
the leading preventable cause of death in this country, and 9
out of 10 adults started smoking in their teens or earlier.  
 “Much more needs to be done,” Frieden said.
