             Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  will
discuss with business ways to put an interim price on carbon
after announcing her government won’t review its proposed
emissions-trading plan until 2012, the Australian Financial
Review said.  
 The government is considering a range of options, including
a national energy efficiency scheme similar to plans already in
place in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, the
newspaper reported, citing senior government officials it didn’t
identify.  
 It is also considering imposing emissions performance
standards on new power stations that would ban new coal plants
and provide certainty for investments in gas-fired base load
power stations, according to the report.
