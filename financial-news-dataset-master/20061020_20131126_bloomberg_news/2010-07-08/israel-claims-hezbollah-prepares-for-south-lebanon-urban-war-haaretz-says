             Israel’s army showed journalists 
yesterday what it said was evidence that the Shiite Muslim 
Hezbollah militia in south Lebanon is preparing for urban 
warfare, the daily Haaretz said, citing Colonel Ronen Marley 
who gave a briefing yesterday.    
 Marley showed journalists previously classified photographs 
he said showed a unit of 90 Hezbollah militiamen operating in a
south Lebanon village where he said they were storing weapons 
close to hospitals and schools, the daily reported.
