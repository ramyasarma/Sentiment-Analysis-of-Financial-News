             The ruble climbed to the strongest
level in more than two weeks as crude oil gained and U.S.
jobless claims fell more than expected, boosting confidence in
the global economic recovery.  
 Russia’s currency strengthened as much as 1 percent versus
the dollar, and closed up 0.9 percent at 30.8525, its highest
intraday level since June 21. The government’s benchmark dollar
bonds due 2020 gained, sending the yield down 12 basis points to
5.32 percent.  
 Crude oil, Russia’s chief export, added as much as 1.9
percent to $75.46 a barrel after U.S. Labor Department figures
showed initial claims for jobless benefits decreased by 21,000
in the week ended July 3 to 454,000. The world economy will
expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the biggest gain since 2007,
compared with an April projection of 4.2 percent, the
International Monetary Fund said in revisions yesterday to its
World Economic Outlook.  
 Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.0454
per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of 31.2065 on
July 7. The contracts are a guide to expectations of currency
movements as they allow foreign investors and companies to fix
the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The ruble gained 0.2 percent against the euro to 39.1050,
leaving it 0.5 percent stronger at 34.5661 against the central
bank’s  target  currency basket, which is used to manage swings
that hurt Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
