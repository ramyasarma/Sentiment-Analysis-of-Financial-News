             Lloyd’s of London Chairman  Peter Levene  and  David Walker , senior adviser at Morgan Stanley, are
planning an investment fund to buy bank branches part-owned by
the British government, according to two people briefed on the
plans.  
 The company will seek sell shares on the London Stock
Exchange within weeks, initially with 50 million pounds ($76
million) of funding, said the people who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private.  
 Levene, 68, and Walker, 70, would be the latest entrants to
the banking industry, following  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Money
Holdings U.K. Ltd. and  Vernon Hill ’s Metro Bank, which opens its
first branch this month. The new company will seek to buy
Northern Rock Plc, with 57 branches, or the 600 outlets being
sold by  Lloyds Banking Group Plc . It will offer branch-based
banking for consumers and businesses, the people said.  
 Walker, who wrote a government-commissioned report on
corporate governance last year, declined to comment. Levene
wasn’t immediately available to comment.  
 The company will have 10 shareholders, including Aviva Plc
and F&C Asset Management Plc, the people said. An F&C spokesman
declined to comment while an Aviva spokesman didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  
 Levene will be chairman and Walker a non-executive director
of the new company, which doesn’t have its own banking license
and is seeking to fill management roles, said one of the people.
