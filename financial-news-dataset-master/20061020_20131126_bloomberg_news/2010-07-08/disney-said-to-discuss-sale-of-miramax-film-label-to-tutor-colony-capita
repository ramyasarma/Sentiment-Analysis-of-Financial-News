             (Corrects fourth paragraph to say Burkle and Weinsteins are
considering a bid.)  
 Construction executive  Ronald Tutor 
is in discussions to buy  Walt Disney Co. ’s Miramax film
division, with backing from private equity firm Colony Capital,
according to two people with knowledge of the talks.  
 Negotiations are continuing almost around the clock, said
one of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks
are private. If consummated, an agreement could be announced by
next week, the person said.  
 Tutor approached Colony prior to the July 4 weekend seeking
financing, said one person with knowledge of the arrangement.
Los Angeles-based Colony, led by chairman and CEO  Tom Barrack ,
has investments that include  Michael Jackson ’s Neverland ranch
in Santa Barbara.  
 Los Angeles investor  Ron Burkle  and Miramax founders  Harvey 
and  Bob Weinstein , who were working on a $625 million offer, are
weighing whether to put in a competing bid, said two other
people with knowledge of the situation. They had ended talks
with Disney in May.  
 The Weinsteins sold Miramax to Disney in 1993. The two, who
left in 2005, control rights to some films and are acquainted
with both Tutor and Barrack, according to one of the people.  
 Disney is seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax,
producer of “The English Patient” and “Shakespeare in Love,”
said one of the people.  
 Tutor, chairman and chief executive of Sylmar, California-
based  Tutor Perini Corp. , didn’t return calls seeking comment.
Disney spokeswoman  Zenia Mucha  declined to comment on the talks.  
 Lead Negotiators  
 Harvey Weinstein, in Sun Valley, Idaho, for media banker
Allen & Co.’s annual conference, declined to discuss Miramax
yesterday.  
 “I think it’s better for me to not say anything,”
Weinstein said in an interview.  
 Leading negotiations for Colony is  Richard Nanula , who was
chief financial officer at Disney when it purchased Miramax,
said the person. Nanula is negotiating with  Kevin Mayer ,
Disney’s executive vice president for corporate strategy.  
 The talks were reported yesterday by the Web site
Deadline.com/Hollywood and by Reuters.  
 Disney gained 20 cents to $33.34 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . It has advanced 3.4 percent
this year.
