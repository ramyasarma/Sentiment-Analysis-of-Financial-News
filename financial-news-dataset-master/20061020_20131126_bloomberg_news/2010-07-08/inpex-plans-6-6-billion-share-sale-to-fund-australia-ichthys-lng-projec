             Inpex Corp. , the operator of a
proposed $20 billion natural-gas project in northern Australia,
plans to raise as much as 587.2 billion yen ($6.6 billion)
selling shares to finance the development.  
 Japan’s largest energy explorer will issue 1.22 million
shares of common stock in Japan and overseas, Inpex said in a
filing to the Ministry of Finance today. The company has 2.36
million outstanding shares. The offer price will be set between
July 26 and 28.  
 In May, the explorer delayed a final investment decision on
the Ichthys project until as late as the fourth quarter of 2011,
without giving a reason. It was the second time Inpex put off
the decision. The company didn’t give a start date, saying
production wouldn’t begin in 2015, as previously planned. The
shares have dropped 34 percent in the last six months.  
 “It’s a big surprise as far as timing goes because Inpex
hasn’t made the investment decision,” said  Tomohiro Jikihara ,
an analyst at Deutsche Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “The stock
could drop as low as 450,000 yen in the near term as the sale
would dilute Inpex shares, but the strong commitment to the
Ichthys project may attract new investors in the long term.”  
 The stock  rose  1.5 percent to close at 476,000 yen in Tokyo
trading before the announcement, after advancing as much as 4.9
percent. The share sale will be underwritten by Goldman Sachs
International, Nomura Securities Co., JP Morgan Securities Ltd.,
and Mizuho Securities Co., Inpex said in the statement.  
 ‘Right Time’  
 “It’s the right time for a share sale and the right time
to strengthen our financial structure, because we are going to
raise capital through debt financing,”  Kazuhiko Itano , a
company spokesman, said by telephone from Tokyo today. He didn’t
give details of the proposed debt financing.  
 Inpex needs to shore up financing as it plans to spend 4
trillion yen over seven years on three overseas projects: the
Ichthys project, the Abadi liquefied natural gas development in
Indonesia and the Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan, Itano said.  
 Inpex, the operator of the Ichthys venture, and partner
 Total SA  are seeking to capitalize on Asia’s growing demand for
the cleaner fuel. The plant will process gas from the WA-285-P
field, 850 kilometers (530 miles) off the coast of northern
Australia, and have an annual capacity of 8 million metric tons.  
 The venture is among more than 12 proposed LNG projects in
Australia and Papua New Guinea competing for customers and
seeking to tap a forecast increase in demand in North Asia for
cleaner fuels.
