             Palladium, the worst-performing
precious metal last quarter, may decline 12 percent to about
$395 an ounce in the coming weeks, according to technical
analysis by Commerzbank AG.  
 The attached chart shows palladium has dropped near its
200-day moving average, the June low and one-year trend line. A
fall below these levels may push prices toward the May and
February lows, the bank said. The low in May was $396.25 an
ounce and in February it was $381.65.  
 “We are convinced that another down leg to the $400/$395
region remains in the pipeline for the weeks ahead,”  Axel Rudolph , a technical strategist at Commerzbank in London, said
in a report. “In the very short-term a minor recovery could be
seen but this is likely to fizzle out” at about $463 or
$487, he said.  
 The second attached chart shows a price rebound may stall
between the 38.2 percent retracement of the metal’s April to May
decline, one of the levels singled out in so-called Fibonacci
analysis, and the two-month resistance line.  
 Palladium for immediate delivery traded at $447.05 an ounce
by 5:55 a.m. in London today. The metal, used mainly in auto
exhaust catalysts and jewelry, declined 7.9 percent last
quarter. Prices are up 9.6 percent this year.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.
