             Copper futures fell in New York,
erasing earlier gains, on renewed concern that slowing economic
growth will reduce metal demand.  
 The International Monetary Fund said yesterday “recent
global stability gains are threatened” by Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis. Before today, copper dropped 9.9 percent in 2010.  
 “There’s still too much uncertainty about the debt issues
in Europe and global growth for copper to go zooming up,” said
 Matthew Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.
“We’re going to see a lot of sideways price action over the
coming months.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery fell 0.7 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $3.008 a pound at 11:41 a.m. on the Comex in New
York.  
 Earlier, the price gained as much as 1.3 percent after the
IMF increased its forecast for world growth. The global economy
will expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the most since 2007 and above
an April projection of 4.2 percent, the IMF said yesterday.  
 “People were breathing a sigh of relief, even though it
may prove to be short-lived,” Zeman said.  
 Copper for delivery in three months was little changed at
$6,650 a metric ton ($3.01 a pound) on the London Metal
Exchange.  
 Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc rose on the LME. Tin
dropped.
