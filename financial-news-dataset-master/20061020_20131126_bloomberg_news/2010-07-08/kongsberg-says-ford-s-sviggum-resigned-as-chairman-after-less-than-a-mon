             Kongsberg Automotive ASA  said  Ford
Motor Co.  executive  Ingvar Sviggum  resigned as chairman today
after less than a month and will be replaced by  Ulla-Britt Frajdin-Hellqvist .  
 Sviggum, who also is Ford of Europe’s vice president of
marketing, sales and service, left to avoid the appearance of a
conflict of interest, Kongsberg, based in the Norwegian city of
the same name, said today in a statement. Sviggum was named
chairman June 17 while continuing his role at Ford.  
 “While we have been putting into place the necessary
guidelines to avoid any conflict of interest issues between Ford
and Kongsberg, it became clearer to me that my new position
could be misunderstood and might be a cause of concern for both
parties,” Sviggum said in the statement.  
 The board appointed Frajdin-Hellqvist, a Kongsberg  director 
since 2007 and former executive at  Volvo AB , to replace him as
chairman, the company said.
