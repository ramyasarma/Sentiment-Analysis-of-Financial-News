             Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Brazil’s
largest bank by market value, may buy brokerages focused on
individual investors to profit from growing local markets, said
the head of retail investment at Itau Corretora, the bank’s
brokerage unit.  
 “We want to continue investing and growing organically,”
said  Jean Sigrist  in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo on
July 6. “It’s possible we may grow inorganically if we find any
opportunity in the market.”  
 Itau traded 98 billion reais ($55.6 billion) of shares this
year through June, according to data compiled by BM&FBovespa SA,
which makes it the third largest brokerage in Brazil by trading
volume. “Itau is a potential consolidator agent in all
brokerage segments,” said Sigrist.
