             New Zealand may offer inflation
indexed bonds in October or November if market conditions are
favorable, interest.co.nz reported, cting Philip Combes,
treasurer of the New Zealand Debt Management Office.  
 The office may invite banks to express interest in being part
of a syndicate within a month, the website reported. The office
hasn’t decided how many bonds it will offer but will use
Australia’s program as a guide, Combes said. Australia ran an
A$4 billion program in a market four to five times that of New
Zealand, the website said.
