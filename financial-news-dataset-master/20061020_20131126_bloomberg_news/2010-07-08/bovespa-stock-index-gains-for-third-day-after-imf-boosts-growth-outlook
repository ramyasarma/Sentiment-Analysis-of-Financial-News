             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index gained
for a third day after the International Monetary Fund raised its
forecasts for the nation’s economic growth and a drop in U.S.
jobless claims bolstered confidence in the global recovery.  
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, gained as crude prices advanced in New York. Redecard
SA, Brazil’s second biggest card-payment processor by market
value, jumped 3.5 percent, leading the advance in the Bovespa
index.  Gerdau SA , Latin America’s largest steelmaker, climbed
1.9 percent after saying it will increase its investment in a
steel mill in Brazil’s Minas Gerais state to 2.4 billion reais
($1.4 billion).  
 “We are living through an environment of very strong
growth in Brazil,” said  Roni Lacerda , who helps manage 2.4
billion reais ($1.3 billion) at Mercatto Gestao de Recursos in
Rio de Janeiro.  
 Bovespa stock index rose 0.3 percent to 63,476.32. The
three-day rally is the longest since April. Thirty-two stocks
rose on the index while 30 fell. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap index 
gained 0.4 percent to 1,175.13. The real added 0.3 percent to
1.7617 per dollar.  
 Brazil, the region’s largest economy, may grow 7.1 percent
this year, up from a previous prediction of 5.5 percent, the IMF
said today in a report. Growth will slow to 4.2 percent next
year, below the world average of 4.3 percent, the IMF said.  
 The Washington-based fund said central banks in emerging-
market nations have tightened monetary policy “appropriately”
and must remain responsive to potential threats to growth.  
 Jobless Claims  
 The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits fell
more than forecast last week while staying at a level that
indicates unemployment will be slow to decline.  Initial claims
for benefits decreased by 21,000 in the week ended July 3 to
454,000, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.  
 Petrobras jumped 0.7 percent to 27.58 reais. Crude rose to
a one-week high in New York.  
 Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil’s largest bank by market
value, gained 2.2 percent to 37.10 reais. Itau may buy
brokerages focused on individual investors to profit from
growing local markets, said the head of retail investment at
Itau Corretora, the bank’s brokerage unit.  
 “We want to continue investing and growing organically,”
said  Jean Sigrist  in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo on
July 6. “It’s possible we may grow inorganically if we find any
opportunity in the market.”  
 The  Bovespa index  trades for 11.7 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.1 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.1
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.5 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
