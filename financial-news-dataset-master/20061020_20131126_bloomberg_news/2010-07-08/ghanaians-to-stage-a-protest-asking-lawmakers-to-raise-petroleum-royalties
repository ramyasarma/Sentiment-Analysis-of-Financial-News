             Ghanaians will today stage a peaceful
demonstration asking lawmakers to increase oil-industry
royalties by almost double the maximum level.  
 The protestors want Ghana to increase royalties to 20
percent from between 4 percent and 12.5 percent now, George
Kotey, who is leading the demonstration in the capital, Accra,
said by phone today.  
 Ghana’s agreements with oil companies allow them to own as
much as 90 percent of any field discovered, Kotey said.  
 “Parliament should increase the royalty rate for the
benefit of the state,” he said.  
 Ghana discovered oil in June 2007 and production is
scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of this year.
