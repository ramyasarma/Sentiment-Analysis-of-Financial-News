             Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition
aims to cut 400 million euros ($506 million) per year in German
health-care costs by limiting margins for drug wholesalers, the
HIB parliamentary newsletter said.  
 Wholesale companies will receive 60 cents per drug package
plus 1.7 percent of the wholesale price up to a maximum of 20.40
euros per package, the newsletter cited a draft law as saying.
Wholesalers at present get between 6 percent and 15 percent of
the wholesale price, capped at 72 euros per package, the
newsletter said.  
 The measure is part of an overhaul of health care intended
to plug an 11-billion euro deficit in the public health-
insurance system in 2011. It follows Cabinet agreement on June
29 for cuts in spending on drugs to reduce soaring costs to
public health-insurance funds.  
 Spending on medicines by public insurers, which cover more
than 70 million of the country’s 82-million population, climbed
5.3 percent to 32 billion euros last year, Health Minister
 Philipp Roesler  has said. The new pricing rules will go into
effect at the beginning of next year.
