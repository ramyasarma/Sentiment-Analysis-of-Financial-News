             India’s  10-year bonds  declined,
snapping a two-day gain, before a debt auction tomorrow and on
concern the  central bank  will increase policy rates for a second
time this month to slow inflation.  
 Yields rose after the International Monetary Fund revised
the nation’s 2010 economic  growth  forecast to 9.4 percent from
its earlier prediction of 8.8 percent in April. The Reserve Bank
of India raised borrowing costs last week for the third time
this year after wholesale prices climbed at close to the fastest
pace since October 2008. India is offering 120 billion rupees
($2.6 billion) of securities.  
 “Growth momentum is certainly strong and the central bank
may do more to contain inflation,” said  Roy Paul , deputy
general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Investors are
also paring some positions before the auctions.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.6 percent as of the
5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The price fell 0.18, or 18 paise per 100 rupee
face amount, to 101.36.  
 Central bank  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last week increased
benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points after  wholesale
price  inflation accelerated to 10.16 percent in May. The
 reverse-repurchase rate  is now 4 percent and the repurchase rate
5.5 percent.  
 Subbarao told reporters today that it’s “not advisable”
to speak on the economy before the central bank’s next scheduled
policy meeting on July 27.  
 Food inflation slowed to 12.63 percent in the week ended
June 26 from a year earlier, according to data published by the
commerce ministry today. Prices gained 12.92 percent the
previous week. Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said July 5 the
sowing of rice, oilseeds and lentils in the June-September
monsoon season may be the highest in two years, aiding a decline
in prices.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, rose to 5.70 percent from 5.65 percent yesterday.
