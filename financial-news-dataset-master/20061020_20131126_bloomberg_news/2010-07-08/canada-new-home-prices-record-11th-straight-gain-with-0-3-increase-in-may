             Canadian new-home  prices  rose 0.3
percent in May, the 11th straight gain, government figures
showed.  
 The new-house price index advance was led by a 3.4 percent
increase in Regina, Saskatchewan, and a 0.7 percent gain for
Toronto and Oshawa, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The
result matched the median prediction in a  survey  of 14
economists gathered by Bloomberg. From a year earlier, new-home
prices increased 2.9 percent in May.  
 Home prices will steady in the second half of this year,
Brookfield Real Estate Services Fund President Phil Soper said
in a report yesterday. Consumers made purchases early in the
year before an increases in mortgage rates and the application
of new sales taxes in Ontario and British Columbia, Soper said.  
 The ‘harmonized’ provincial sales taxes took effect July 1
and will be excluded from the home price index, meaning future
reports may show declines in Ontario and British Columbia,
Statistics Canada said.
