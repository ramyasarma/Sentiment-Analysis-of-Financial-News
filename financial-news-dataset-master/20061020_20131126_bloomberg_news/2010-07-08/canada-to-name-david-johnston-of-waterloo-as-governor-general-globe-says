             Canada will name University of
Waterloo President David Johnston as the country’s new Governor-
General today, the Globe and Mail reported, citing unidentified
people.  
 Johnston, 69, will replace  Michaelle Jean  when her term
ends in September, the newspaper said. Johnston was chosen by a
special committee appointed by Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper .  
 The announcement will come two days after  Queen Elizabeth II  finished her tour of Canada. The Queen must give her blessing
before a new Governor-General is chosen, the newspaper said.
