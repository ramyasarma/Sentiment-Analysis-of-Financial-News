             Office vacancies in U.S. central
business areas fell in the second quarter from the prior three
months, the first drop since 2007, as companies hired workers
and took advantage of lower rents, Cushman & Wakefield said.  
 The average vacancy rate in central business districts fell
to 14.8 percent from 15 percent at the end of the first quarter,
the New York-based broker said today. Sixteen of the 31 cities
tracked by Cushman had declines in vacancies, the company said.  
 “Markets throughout the U.S. continue to strengthen, as it
becomes strongly apparent that the national vacancy rate for
CBDs has peaked,”  Maria Sicola , executive managing director and
head of Americas research for Cushman, said in a statement.  
 Office vacancies in both central business districts and
suburban areas rose to 17.4 percent in the second quarter, the
highest since 1993, New York-based research company  Reis Inc. 
said July 6. Cushman’s figures are for central business
districts in cities including New York, Washington, D.C.,
Philadelphia, Boston and San Francisco.  
 Some office landlords cut their rents to fill space,
Cushman said. The average rent fell to $36.49 a square foot from
$36.88 in the first quarter. Nineteen of the 31 districts
covered in the survey had quarterly declines in rates and 13 of
those had drops of less than 3 percent, a smaller decline than
in past quarters, Cushman said.  
 ‘Nearing Bottom’  
 “While there is still substantial competition among
landlords to offer the best deal to prospective tenants, rental
rates are nearing a bottom in several markets,” Sicola said.  
 The U.S. has added 882,000 jobs since the beginning of the
year, according to the Labor Department. The drop in office
vacancies in the second quarter followed nine straight increases
dating back to the last three months of 2007, when the rate
bottomed out at 9.7 percent, Cushman said.  
 Manhattan’s three submarkets -- Midtown, Midtown South and
Downtown -- had the lowest vacancy rates among the central
business districts tracked by Cushman. Midtown South’s vacancy
rate fell to 9.3 percent from 9.9 percent in the first quarter,
Downtown’s rate was little changed at 9.9 percent and Midtown’s
rate declined to 11.5 percent from 12.6 percent.  
 Cushman  is the largest closely held property services
company, with 231 offices in 58 countries and 15,000 employees.
