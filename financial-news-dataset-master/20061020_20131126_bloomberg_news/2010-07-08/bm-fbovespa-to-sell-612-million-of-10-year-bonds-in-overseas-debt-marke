             BM&FBovespa SA , the owner of Latin
America’s biggest securities exchange, plans to sell $612
million of 10-year bonds in overseas markets as soon as
tomorrow, said a person familiar with the offering.  
 Bank of America Corp., Banco Bradesco SA, HSBC Holdings Plc
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are arranging the sale, said the
person, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  
 Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto said May 12 the
company planned to sell $620 million of 10-year bonds in
international markets to pay for the acquisition of its stake in
 CME Group Inc.   
 BM&FBovespa is seeking to raise its stake in CME Group,
which owns the world’s largest futures market, as part of an
agreement to create an electronic trading platform. The Sao
Paulo-based company plans to increase its stake to 5 percent
from 1.8 percent, according to a February regulatory filing.  
 A BM&FBovespa spokeswoman didn’t immediately return calls
seeking comment.
