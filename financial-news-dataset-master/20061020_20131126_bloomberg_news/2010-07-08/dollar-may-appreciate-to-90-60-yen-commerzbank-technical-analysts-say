             The dollar may reach 90.60 against
Japan’s currency should it hold above a so-called support area
between 87.15 and 87.00 yen, Commerzbank AG said, citing
technical indicators.  
 The 87.15 figure represents lows reached in December 2008
and January 2009, according to  Karen Jones , head of fixed-
income, commodity and currency technical analysis at Commerzbank
in London. The 87.00 support level is the 78.6 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the Nov. 2009 to May 2010 advance, she said.  
 “We look for the rally to extend to 89.23/89.93, the 38.2
percent and 50 percent Fibonacci retracements of the selloff
from the June peak, en route to the 90.60 May-to-July
downtrend,” Jones wrote in an e-mailed report today.  
 The dollar strengthened 0.8 percent to 88.37 yen as of 8:49
a.m. in London.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. A support level is an area on a chart where
technical analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency and a
resistance level is an area there they anticipate sell orders.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
