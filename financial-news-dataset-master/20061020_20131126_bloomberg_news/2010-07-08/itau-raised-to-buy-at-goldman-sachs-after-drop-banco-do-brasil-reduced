             Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil’s
biggest non-government bank, was raised to “buy” from
“neutral” at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which said the retreat
after Bank of America Corp. agreed to sell its stake in May was
“overdone.”  
 Goldman Sachs cut Banco do Brasil SA, Latin America’s
biggest lender by assets, to “neutral” from “buy,” citing
its rally since last week’s share sale, according to a research
note.
