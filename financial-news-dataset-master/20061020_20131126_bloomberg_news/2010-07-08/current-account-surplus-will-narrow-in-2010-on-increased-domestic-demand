             China’s current-account surplus will
shrink for a second year in 2010 as domestic demand plays a
greater role in driving the nation’s economic growth, according
to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.  
 The gap, the broadest measure of trade, amounted to 6.1
percent of China’s gross domestic product last year, down from
9.6 percent in 2008, China’s currency regulator said today in a
 statement  on its website.  
 “The momentum for the trade surplus to widen will
moderate,” the SAFE said. “The current-account surplus as a
percentage of GDP will decline further.”  
 The current-account surplus shrank 32 percent in the first
quarter to $53.6 billion, while the  capital and financial
account  reversed a deficit a year ago to show net inflows of
$64.2 billion, SAFE reported July 5. It remains “an arduous
task” for China to promote balance in its international
payments, the currency regulator said today.  
 “There’s a growing trend for Chinese companies and
individuals to hold the yuan and borrow dollars” due to the
interest-rate differentials between China and the U.S. and
expectations the yuan will appreciate, it said.  
 Three-month deposit rates are 1.71 percent in China and
0.53 percent in the U.S., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yuan has strengthened 0.7 percent to 6.7760 per
dollar since a two-year-old peg was relaxed last month and non-
deliverable forwards suggest the currency will gain another 1.5
percent in a year.  
 “We’ll make manage and adjust the yuan rate in a dynamic
mode and keep the yuan basically stable at a reasonable and
balanced level,” the regulator reiterated.
