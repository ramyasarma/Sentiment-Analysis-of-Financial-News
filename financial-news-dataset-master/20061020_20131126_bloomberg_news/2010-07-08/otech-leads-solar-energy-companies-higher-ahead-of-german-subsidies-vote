             Motech Industries Inc. led solar
energy companies higher in Taipei trading ahead of a vote by the
German parliament tomorrow to ease reductions in solar-power
subsidies, said E Sun Securities Co.   
 The stock surged 6.9 percent to NT$117 as of 9:47 a.m., set
for the highest since April 29. Gintech Energy Corp. gained 3.51
percent to NT$97.  
 “There would be greater demand from the German clients if
they get more subsidies,” said Kun-ta Tsou, an analyst at E
Sun, by telephone in Taipei.
