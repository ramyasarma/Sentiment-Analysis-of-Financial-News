             U.S. stock-index futures advanced
after jobless claims decreased more than forecast last week,
easing concern that a slow-to-recover labor market will stifle
the economic recovery.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September climbed 0.3 percent to 1,062.6 at 8:35 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 28 points, or
0.3 percent, to 10,008.  
 Initial jobless claims decreased by 21,000 in the week
ended July 3, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. Filings were lower than the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. The number of people receiving
unemployment insurance dropped to the lowest point since 2008,
while those getting emergency benefits also declined after
Congress failed to pass legislation extending the assistance.  
 U.S. stocks rallied yesterday, sending the S&P 500 up 3.1
percent for its biggest gain in six weeks, as banks advanced and
retail-sales growth bolstered optimism that consumer spending is
weathering a drop in confidence.                          Still,
the S&P 500 remains 13 percent below its April 23 high after a
sovereign debt-crisis in Europe rattled markets and economic
reports from the U.S. and China suggested that the recovery is
stalling.  
 Alcoa Inc.  is due to unofficially start the second-quarter
earnings season next week. Profits for S&P 500 companies are
projected to have increased 34 percent in the April-June period
and by the same amount in 2010, according to analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Stocks have rebounded this week on optimism losses last
quarter may be unwarranted given that the global economy is
still growing.  
          
          


  
     
       
     
           
                           
                 
                 
                                       
                                   
               
                        
           
                          July 8 (Bloomberg) -- Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC, talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li about the outlook for U.S. stocks.
     Bianco, speaking from Chicago, also discusses his investment strategy, stress tests for European banks, and the U.S. housing market. European Union regulators are carrying out stress tests on 91 banks, accounting for 65 percent of the area’s banking industry, to examine whether they can withstand a shrinking economy and a drop in government bond values.
