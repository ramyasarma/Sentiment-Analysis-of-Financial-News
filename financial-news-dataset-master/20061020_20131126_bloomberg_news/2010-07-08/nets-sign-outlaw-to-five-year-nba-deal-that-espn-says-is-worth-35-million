             The New Jersey Nets agreed in
principle with forward  Travis Outlaw  on a five-year contract.  
 Financial details weren’t disclosed in a news release from
team President  Rod Thorn . The deal is worth $35 million,
according to ESPN.  
 The Nets, who had the NBA’s worst record last season at 12-
70, are among six teams awaiting tonight’s decision on where
Most Valuable Player LeBron James will sign as a free agent.  
 “We are very pleased to add Travis to our roster,” Thorn
said. “He is a young, athletic player who will fit in very well
with the style of play Avery (coach  Avery Johnson ) has
installed.”  
 Outlaw, 25, has played for seven seasons in the National
Basketball Association, averaging 9.5 points per game and 3.4
rebounds per game. He began his career when the Portland Trail
Blazers drafted him with the 23rd pick in 2003.  
 Outlaw was limited to 34 games last year because of a
fractured left foot. He appeared in 11 games with Portland
before being traded in February to the Los Angeles Clippers.
