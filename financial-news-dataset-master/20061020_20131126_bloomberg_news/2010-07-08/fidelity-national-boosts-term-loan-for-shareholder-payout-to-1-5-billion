             Fidelity National Information
Services Inc. cut pricing and increased the size of a term loan
it’s seeking for a shareholder payout by $100 million to $1.5
billion, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.  
 The company will pay lenders 3.75 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.5 percent Libor
floor, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the terms are private. The company initially proposed a margin
of 4 percentage points over Libor, the rate banks charge to lend
to each other.  
 Fidelity National will sell the six-year debt at 99 cents
on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the
company and increasing the yield for investors. Previously the
company proposed an original issue discount of as much as 98.5
cents on the dollar.
