             H&R Block Inc. , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, was the largest decliner on the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  after  Russ Smyth  quit as president and chief executive
officer to join a private company.  
 H&R Block declined $1.27, or 8.2 percent, to $14.22 at 4:20
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . It fell as
much as 13 percent, the most since November 2002, and traded for
as little as $13.44, the lowest since May 2001.  
 Investors  are likely to conclude that Smyth decided to
“throw in the towel” after almost two years as CEO, analyst
 Bill Carcache  of Macquarie (USA) Equities Research wrote in a
note to investors today. Kansas City, Missouri-based H&R Block
has been losing market share to online competitors such as
 Intuit Inc. ’s TurboTax.  
 “There’s nothing positive about Mr. Smyth’s departure,”
wrote Carcache, who has a “ neutral ” rating on the stock.
“Without him, we now quite frankly view H&R Block as an
organization that may lack the drive, fierce competitiveness,
and strong leadership necessary to outperform.”  
 Smyth, 53, was brought in by Chairman  Richard Breeden , 60,
the hedge-fund manager and former chief of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, to help turn around H&R Block. The
stock has lost a quarter of its value since Breeden became
chairman, and last month the company said profit for fiscal 2010
from continuing operations dropped 4.7 percent.  
 Proxy Contest  
 Breeden staged a proxy contest and ousted CEO  Mark Ernst  in
2007 after the firm posted  losses  of at least $1 billion tied to
subprime mortgages. Director  Alan Bennett , the acting CEO in
2007 and 2008, will take over as CEO, the company said in a
statement.  
 Smyth’s departure follows those of Chief Financial Officer
 Becky Shulman  on April 30 and general counsel  Brian Woram  on
July 2. Smyth spent 21 years at  McDonald’s Corp.,  where he rose
to president of the company’s European unit.  
 H&R Block didn’t name Smyth’s new employer; he couldn’t be
reached for comment and senior executives including Breeden
weren’t immediately available.  
 “The decision to leave was made by Russ and it was a
personal one, not one that reflects some underlying negative
with H&R Block,”  Alexander Paris , an equity analyst at
Barrington Research Associates Inc., said in an interview. “He
had the opportunity to return to his hometown of Chicago and
back to the industry from which he came.”  
 Paris said he spoke with interim CFO  Jeff Brown  about
Smyth’s reasons for leaving. Brown did not tell him the name of
the company, only that it was a large private company that
“sounds like something in the food industry,” Paris said.  
 Profit Slides  
 Smyth closed 400 under-performing tax offices and cut about
400 jobs after the company said in February that it wouldn’t
meet its fiscal 2010 earnings forecast.  
 Paris, who cut H&R Block from “outperform” to “market
perform,” said he hasn’t lost confidence in the company and
that the damage has already been done to the stock. The company
is undervalued and might attract bids from buyout firms.  
 “It is a very high-quality company that produces a lot of
free cash flow that is even higher than its reported net
income,” Paris said. “It has a great balance sheet and low
capital intensity. This would be a perfect private
transaction.”  
 Vance Edelson , an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said there’s
no reason to look for a buyer and that an outsider wouldn’t
necessarily do better with a turnaround. Breeden “is likely to
see if the company fares better next tax season with yet another
new management team in place.”  
 Bennett previously was CFO at  Aetna Inc. , the third-largest
U.S. health insurer, according to the H&R Block statement. He’s
also a director at oilfield-services provider Halliburton Co.
and at TJX Cos., owner of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls discount
retail chains.
