             The Financial Services Authority
plans to focus its stepped up enforcement efforts on stamping
out mortgage fraud and money laundering in the year ahead, the
agency’s enforcement director  Margaret Cole  said.  
 The regulator will visit mortgage lenders to review their
financial controls and has started to study bank services “that
pose high risks” for money laundering, she said in the FSA’s
July Financial Crime  newsletter . Last month the FSA said it
doesn’t want the coalition government’s plan to dismantle the
agency to disrupt a pipeline of criminal cases and record fines.  
 “There has been speculation over the FSA’s future role in
relation to reducing financial crime risks,” Cole said. “We
are determined to deliver a strong deterrent message. Whilst
much has been achieved in the financial crime arena, there is
still work to be done.”  
 The London-based watchdog has increased fines and won three
of the four insider-trading cases it has brought to trial, after
complaints it did little to stop the financial crisis. In the
face of those changes, Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said June 17 he plans abolish the FSA and give most of
its power to the Bank of England.  
 The FSA’s enforcement unit, which prosecutes insider
trading and market abuse, will be combined with the U.K. Serious
Fraud Office and the  Office of Fair Trading  to create an
economic-crime agency.
