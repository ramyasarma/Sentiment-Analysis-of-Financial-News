             Nikon Corp.  plans to introduce a
new type of single-lens reflex camera as early as this fiscal
year, President  Makoto Kimura  said.  
 The “new concept” model will probably have an enhanced
function for video recording and may adopt the so-called
mirrorless structure, Kimura said in an interview today in
Tokyo. “It could be any time this fiscal year or the
following year, as new models are starting to sell,” he said,
declining to specify when the product will be available.  
 Nikon, Japan’s biggest SLR camera maker, has been
intensively focusing on development of the product to fuel
revenue growth of digital SLR cameras, Kimura said. The
company aims to boost sales of cameras with interchangeable
lenses about 80 percent to 6.65 million units in three years
to March 2013, Nikon said last month.  
 In April, Panasonic Corp. started selling a new model of
mirrorless camera, lightweight models that don’t have the
mirror used in conventional SLR cameras that allows the user
to see the same image in the viewfinder as the lens captures.
 Sony Corp.  introduced a similar model last month.  
 Sales in Japan of cameras with interchangeable lenses
rose 35 percent in unit terms and 26 percent by value in May,
partly because of the introduction of the news models,
according to electronics research firm BCN Inc. in Tokyo.  
 Global Camera Shipments  
 Worldwide shipments of digital cameras rose 21 percent
in the five months to May 31 from a year earlier, according
to Tokyo-based  Camera & Imaging Products Association . Revenue
from cameras with interchangeable lenses jumped 42 percent
while that from compact cameras gained 14 percent.  
 Nikon rose 4.1 percent to close at 1,611 yen in Tokyo
 trading  today, narrowing its decline this year to 12 percent.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 2.8 percent
today.  
 Tokyo-based Nikon is in its first year of a three-year
business plan in which the company aims to boost net income
to 65 billion yen ($736 million). That’s more than double the
30 billion yen net income the company  forecasts  for the year
started April 1.  
 Nikon is targeting record  sales  of 1.1 trillion yen for
the year ending March 2013, 25 percent higher than the 880
billion yen revenue expected for the current fiscal year, the
company said June 18.
