             China’s wages will increase by an
average of between 15 percent and 20 percent annually for
unskilled labor in the next five to 10 years, according to
Citigroup Inc. analyst Eddie Lau in a report today.  
 The annual wage growth for skilled labor is likely to
average 12 percent, Lau said. The rise in income should boost
discretionary spending and benefit department stores and
distributors of appliances, according to the report.
