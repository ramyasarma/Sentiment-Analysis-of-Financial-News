             Turkish Justice Minister Sadullah 
Ergin said there’ll be no early general election after the 
nation’s top court ruled last night to partially annul 
constitutional changes passed by parliament, Vatan said.  
 Suat Kilic, a deputy chief of the governing Justice and 
Development Party’s parliament group, also said elections will 
be held on time, according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.   
 Parliamentary elections in Turkey are due by July next 
year.
