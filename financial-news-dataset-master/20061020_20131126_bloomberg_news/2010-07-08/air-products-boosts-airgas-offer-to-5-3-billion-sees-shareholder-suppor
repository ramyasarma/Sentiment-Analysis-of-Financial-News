             Air Products & Chemicals Inc. , the
industrial-gases producer attempting a hostile takeover of
Airgas Inc., raised its offer by $3.50 a share to $5.3 billion
in an effort to win more shareholder support.  
 Air Products will pay $63.50 cash for each Airgas share,
rather than the $60 originally offered, the Allentown,
Pennsylvania-based company said today in a statement. That’s a
5.8 percent increase and represents a 46 percent premium over
the closing price on Feb. 4, the day before the bid was publicly
announced.  
 Air Products Chief Executive Officer  John McGlade  said he
is raising his offer after “extensive” talks with Airgas
shareholders. Air Products has nominated three directors to
compete against  Airgas  nominees at the annual meeting to be held
by Sept. 17. Shareholders of record on July 19 are eligible to
vote at the meeting.  
 “We are convinced we will have widespread support from
Airgas shareholders for this transaction and for our board
nominees and proposals,” McGlade said in the statement. “We
hope the Airgas Board will take the responsible step for their
shareholders and promptly begin negotiations with us.”  
 Airgas, based in Radnor, Pennsylvania, had refused to
negotiate with Air Products, calling the $60 offer “grossly
inadequate.”  
 Airgas rose 63 cents, or 1 percent, to $64.50 at 4:46 p.m.
after the close of regular New York Stock Exchange trading.  The
shares  increased 34 percent this year as of the close today.
