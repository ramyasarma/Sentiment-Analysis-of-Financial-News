             U.S. President Barack Obama said a
“lot of work” is still needed to stabilize Afghanistan, and
through that Pakistan, according to an interview published by
Corriere della Sera today.  
 A review at the end of 2010 will determine if sending more
troops was “effective” before local troops and police replace
foreign forces from next year, he told the daily newspaper.  
 Obama said he maintains a U.S. view that it would be
“wise” to accept Turkey into the European Union. “If they
don’t feel part of the European family, it’s natural they would
look elsewhere for alliances and affiliations,” the Milan-based
newspaper cited Obama as saying.
