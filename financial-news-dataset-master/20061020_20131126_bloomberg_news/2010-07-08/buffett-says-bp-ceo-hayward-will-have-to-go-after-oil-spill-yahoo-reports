             Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett 
said no one has an interest in  Tony Hayward  remaining as chief
executive officer of BP Plc after the worst oil spill in U.S.
history in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 “It’s not in BP’s interest to actually continue with him
as CEO,” Buffett said in an interview with Yahoo! News and the
Huffington Post that was  published on Yahoo’s website  today. “I
don’t know him personally and he may be the most wonderful guy
in the world, but it’s not in their interest and not in our
country’s interest to have him continue.”  
 BP spokeswoman  Sheila Williams  in London declined to
comment on the report. The company has said there are no plans
to replace Hayward.  
 Buffett said that Hayward probably wouldn’t still be
working for him if BP was one of his companies.  
 “When you have something of that impact on society, it’s
like the captain of a ship,” Buffett said. “You’re responsible
even though some second lieutenant made all the mistakes.”
