             Treasuries  fell, pushing 10-year
 yields  above 3 percent for the first time this month, after data
showing a bigger-than-forecast drop in initial claims for
unemployment benefits last week damped bonds’ haven appeal.  
 Longer-term yields rose for a second day, even after the
government drew more bids than average at a record-tying $12
billion sale of inflation-linked debt. The Labor Department said
initial  jobless claims  fell to 454,000, and the International
Monetary Fund raised a forecast for global growth. The U.S. said
it will sell $69 billion of notes and bonds next week.  
 “Some of the data has given support to the thought that
even though the economic recovery is not going to be robust, we
are not going to go into a double-dip” recession,  said
 Theodore Ake , head of Treasury trading in New York at Societe
Generale. “The market had overdone it on pricing.”  
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year note increased 4 basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.03 percent at 4:17 p.m.
in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. Earlier it
touched 3.05 percent, the highest level since June 28. The 3.5
percent security due in May 2020 fell 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000
face amount, to 104.  
 The  30-year bond yield  rose 5 basis points to 4 percent and
touched 4.02 percent, also the highest since June 28.  
 Treasuries pared losses as stocks fluctuated after erasing
an early gain. The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index rose as much as 1
percent and fell 0.2 percent. Drops in equities spurred some
Treasury buying, said  Tom Tucci , head of U.S. government bond
trading at Royal Bank of Canada in New York, one of 18 primary
dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve.  
 ‘Market Cheapened Up’  
 The auction of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, or TIPS, drew a yield of 1.295 percent, compared
with an average forecast of 1.340 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.88, compared with an average of 2.45
for the previous 10 sales.  
 “The market cheapened up, and it was a draw for
investors,” said  Michael Pond , an interest-rate strategist in
New York at Barclays Plc, which as a primary dealer is required
to bid at Treasury auctions. “We are seeing a decent amount of
demand.”  
 Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 51.9 percent of the notes, compared with
an average of 39 percent for the past 10 sales. Direct bidders,
non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids directly with
the Treasury, purchased 4.2 percent of the securities, compared
with 7.5 percent as the last sale, on April 5.  
 Matched 2004 Sale  
 At the April auction, the securities yielded 1.709 percent.
Today’s sale matched the size of an offering in January 2004.  
 TIPS have returned 3.4 percent this year, compared with a
5.8 percent gain for the broader Treasury market, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  
 The Treasury in May added more offerings of TIPS to improve
the liquidity of the securities, whose principal is adjusted to
reflect changes in the consumer price index. The increased
issuance comes as the U.S. begins to reduce the size of other
Treasury offerings after it increased sales to all-time highs to
finance record $1 trillion-plus budget deficits.  
 President  Barack Obama  is starting to scale back borrowing.
The U.S. government still needs to sell debt to finance an
annual budget deficit that the White House forecasts at $1.6
trillion in 2010.  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a
gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices, touched 1.68
percentage points yesterday, the narrowest since Oct. 5, and was
1.82 percentage points today. The spread reached 2.49 percentage
points on Jan. 11, the highest level since July 2008.  
 Next Week’s Auctions  
 The Treasury said today it will sell $35 billion in three-
year notes, $21 billion in 10-year debt and $13 billion in 30-
year bonds on three consecutive days starting July 12, matching
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of 10 primary dealers.  
 Initial jobless claims decreased by 21,000 in the week
ended July 3, Labor Department data showed today in Washington.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a drop to
460,000. The number of people receiving unemployment insurance
dropped to the lowest point since 2008, while those getting
emergency benefits also declined.  
 The world economy will expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the
biggest gain since 2007, compared with an April projection of
4.2 percent, the Washington-based IMF said in revisions
yesterday to its World Economic Outlook. Growth next year is
projected to be 4.3 percent, unchanged from the April forecast.  
 “The IMF’s upgrade to its growth forecast helped improve
risk sentiment,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist
at Monument Securities Ltd. in London.  
 European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
today that “indicators suggest that a strengthening in economic
activity took place during the spring.” The ECB’s main interest
rate is appropriate, and inflation expectations “remain firmly
anchored,” he said at a press conference in Frankfurt. The ECB
held its benchmark rate at record low 1 percent.
