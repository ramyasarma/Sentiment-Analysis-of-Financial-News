             Deutsche Bank AG  has put  Axel Wieandt 
in charge of the sale of its  BHF-Bank AG  unit,  Handelsblatt 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Wieandt, who stepped down as chief executive officer of
Hypo Real Estate Holding AG this year and rejoined Frankfurt-
based Deutsche Bank, may also replace  Wilhelm von Haller  as head
of BHF’s management board, the newspaper said.
