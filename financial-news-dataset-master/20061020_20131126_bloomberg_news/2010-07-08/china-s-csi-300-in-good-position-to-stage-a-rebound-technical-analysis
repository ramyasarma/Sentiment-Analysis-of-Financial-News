             China’s  CSI 300 Index  is in a “good
position” to rebound after dropping more than any other Asian
stock measure this year, according to technical analysis by
Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 The CSI 300 has touched the bottom band that marked its
downward trend this year and may rebound should that band hold,
Nomura analysts Kenneth Chan,  Tacky Cheng  and  Desmond Chan  wrote
in a report yesterday. The gauge’s  relative strength index  also
suggests Chinese stocks are “oversold” while the 2,500 level
is a “good reference for medium-term support,” according to
the analysts.  
 The  CSI 300 , tracking yuan-denominated shares, or A shares,
traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, has dropped 28 percent this
year amid concern policy tightening and a slowdown in European
demand for exports will hurt China’s economic growth. The index
lost 0.1 percent to 2,578.19 at the 11:30 a.m. local-time break,
following a two-day, 2.7 percent rebound.  
 “Historical evidence says should the index hold up at the
bottom band, there is a good chance there will be a rebound,”
the analysts said. “We have seen this shape up on four times
during the seven months the downward channel has held.”  
 The index’s 14-day RSI, which tracks how rapidly prices
gain or retreat, on July 5 touched 27.60, below the 30-level
that indicates to some analysts that prices are poised to
recover. The RSI is currently at 37.  
 Nomura’s chief Asian strategist  Sean Darby  said on June 23
he’s turning “bullish” on A shares for the first time this
year amid signs of improvement.  
 “While the CSI 300 posted the worst performance, compared
with the non-Japan Asia region, year-to-date, its long and
significant underperformance suggests there is a good chance to
catch up,” the analysts wrote in yesterday’s report.
