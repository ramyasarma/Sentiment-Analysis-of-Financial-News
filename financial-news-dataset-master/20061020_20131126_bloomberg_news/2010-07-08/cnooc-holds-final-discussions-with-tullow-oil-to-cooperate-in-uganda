             Cnooc Ltd. , China’s biggest offshore
energy explorer, said it’s in “final discussions” on
cooperating with Tullow Oil Plc to develop three oil blocks in
Uganda’s Lake Albert basin.  
 The Beijing-based company is “happy” with the Uganda
government’s conditional approval for  Tullow ’s purchase of
assets from  Heritage Oil Plc , spokesman  Jiang Yongzhi  said by
telephone today. Shares of Cnooc rose in Hong Kong trading.  
 Tullow, the U.K. explorer with the most licenses in Africa,
had agreed earlier this year to buy Heritage’s interest in two
Uganda blocks. Heritage had originally expected the sale to be
cleared in the first quarter. The approval, delayed by tax
issues, will pave the way for Tullow to bring in Cnooc and  Total
SA  to help develop blocks 1, 2 and 3A in Lake Albert.  
 The U.K. explorer is enlisting partners to help shoulder an
estimated $5 billion needed to develop the fields. About 1.5
billion barrels of oil are still to be discovered in the basin,
according to Tullow estimates.  
 Cnooc aims to increase production by as much as 27 percent
this year to help meet demand from the world’s second-biggest
energy consumer. China’s economy may grow 10.1 percent in 2010,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 27 economists.  
 Shares of Cnooc gained 2.2 percent to HK$12.98 at 10:30 a.m.
local time, compared with the 1.5 percent increase in the
benchmark Hang Seng Index.
