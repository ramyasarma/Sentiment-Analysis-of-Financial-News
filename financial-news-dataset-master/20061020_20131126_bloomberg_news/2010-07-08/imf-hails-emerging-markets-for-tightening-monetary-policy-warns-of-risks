             The International Monetary Fund said
central banks in emerging economies have tightened monetary
policy “appropriately” and must remain responsive to potential
threats to economic growth.  
 While global growth was revised up by the Washington-based
lender, downside risks triggered by recent financial turbulence
remain, it said in its  latest  World Economic Outlook published
today.  
 Policies in emerging economies should help rebalance global
demand, including through structural reforms and greater
exchange rate flexibility, the fund said. Monetary policy
requirements are “more diverse” for emerging and developing
economies, it said.  
 “Some of the larger, fast-growing emerging economies,
faced with rising inflation or asset price pressures, have
appropriately tightened monetary conditions, the IMF said in the
report. “But monetary policy actions must remain responsive in
both directions. In particular, should downside risks to global
growth materialize, there may need to be a swift policy
reversal.”  
 The Chinese, Indian and Brazilian central banks are among
emerging market regulators that have raised borrowing costs
since the height of the credit crisis, while Russia, Hungary and
Romania have ended easing cycles.  
 Demand Pressures  
 In emerging economies with excessive external surpluses,
monetary tightening “should be supported with nominal effective
exchange rate appreciation as excess demand pressures build, the
lender said.  
 “Any concerns about exchange rate overshooting could be
addressed by fiscal tightening to ease pressure on interest
rates, by some build-up of reserves, by macroprudential
measures, and possibly by stricter controls on capital inflows
-- mindful of the potential to create new distortions -- or
looser controls on outflows,” it said.  
 Russia’s economy will grow 4.3 percent this year and 4.1
percent in 2011, the IMF said, revising up earlier predictions
for 4 percent and 3.3 percent growth.  
 Central and eastern Europe’s combined gross domestic
product will rise 3.2 percent this year and 3.4 percent next,
the fund said.
