             DIFC Investments LLC, the developer
of the Dubai International Financial Center, had its credit
rating cut one level by Moody’s Investors Service due to its
high indebtedness and poor cash generation.  
 DIFC Investments, which reported a $561.5 million loss in
2009, was cut from B2 to B3, the sixth-highest non-investment
grade rating, Moody’s said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 The downgrade reflects DIFC Investment’s “highly leveraged
financial profile, its expected heavy reliance on asset
disposals in the coming 12 to 24 months” to repay debt and its
“continued negative free cash flow generation,” Moody’s said in
the statement. The downgrade also factors in Dubai’s
“challenging” real-estate market, Moody’s said.  
 DIFC Investments posted a loss for 2009 as it wrote down
the value of properties. Real-estate prices have slumped more
than 50 percent from their peak in August 2008 as mortgages
dried up and speculators fled, according to Colliers
International. The company recorded a profit of $842.5 million
in 2008.  
 DIFC opened in 2004 to attract international banks, asset
managers and insurers and is home to the regional offices of
banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc and HSBC
Holdings Plc.  
 The development of the DIFC as a financial free zone is an
“important element” of Dubai’s development strategy, and
government support, if needed, “should remain relatively
manageable” if asset sales are planned, Moody’s said.
