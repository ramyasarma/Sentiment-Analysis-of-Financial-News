             Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said the U.S. economy may be undergoing what he called
a “pause,” and that he can’t rule out the possibility of a so-
called double-dip recession.  
 “Of course, there’s a possibility,” Greenspan said in an
interview on CNBC today. “The trouble is there’s always a
possibility in both directions.”  
 Greenspan, who ran the central bank from 1987 to 2006, said
“it’s more than likely” that a “pause” is occurring in the
world’s largest economy. Inventory accumulation “has stopped”
and production “has flattened out,” the 84-year-old former
central banker said.  
 Companies added 83,000 workers to their payrolls in June,
less than forecast by economists, the Labor Department report
said last week. The report capped a month of data on housing and
manufacturing that point to a slowdown in the economy.  
 Stocks rose today, giving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
its first-three day rally since April, after the Labor
Department reported that claims for unemployment benefits fell
last week more than forecast and the International Monetary Fund
raised its estimate for global growth in 2010.  
 “Stock market behavior over the last several days” has
been “encouraging,” Greenspan said after S&P 500 index rose
0.9 percent to 1,070.25 at 4 p.m. in New York, its highest close
since June 28. “Banks are scared, but, then again, so are
businesses.’  
 He added that there are “still huge imbalances in the flow
of funds,” and that China’s currency remains “undervalued.”
After he spoke, the U.S. Treasury Department released a report
to Congress saying the yuan “remains undervalued,” while
stopping short of branding the country a currency manipulator.
