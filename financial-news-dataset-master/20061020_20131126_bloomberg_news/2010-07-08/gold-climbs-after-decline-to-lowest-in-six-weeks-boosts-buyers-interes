             Gold fluctuated near $1,200 an ounce
in London on speculation that the metal’s drop to the lowest
level in more than six weeks is prompting some investors to
increase holdings.  
 The metal fell to $1,185 an ounce yesterday, the lowest
price since May 24, before rebounding to close above $1,200. The
dollar slipped to the lowest level against the euro since May 12
today, while European equities rose as the International
Monetary Fund raised its 2010 global growth forecast to 4.6
percent from 4.2 percent and on speculation tests on banks will
ease concern about the health of the financial system.  
 “We are continuing to see very good physical demand” near
the $1,200 level, said  Walter de Wet , an analyst at Standard
Bank Plc in London. “With markets as volatile as they are,
there’s not the momentum yet for gold to move much higher, but
it will be supported on dips.”  
 Gold for immediate delivery dropped $2.55, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,200.20 an ounce at 11:28 a.m. in London. Prices gained as
much as 0.4 percent and fell as much as 0.3 percent. Bullion for
August delivery was $1 higher at $1,199.90 on the Comex in New
York.  
 The morning “fixing” for gold in London, or price used by
some mining companies to sell their production, rose to
$1,201.25 an ounce from yesterday’s  afternoon  fixing of
$1,193.25 an ounce.  
 Gold has weakened 5.1 percent since reaching a record
$1,265.30 an ounce on June 21, limiting this year’s advance to
9.4 percent. The metal is set for a 10th annual gain as
investors seek to protect their wealth from prolonged financial
turbulence in Europe and on concern the global recovery may
slow.  
 “Gold bulls will be heartened that gold was able to close
above $1,200 yesterday,” said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte. in Singapore. “Some investors may also bet
that the corrective decline seen earlier had run its course and
start accumulating long positions.”  
 Stress Tests  
 European Union banking regulators have told lenders that
their planned stress tests on banks may assume a loss of about
17 percent on Greek government debt and 3 percent on Spanish
bonds, two people briefed on the talks said yesterday.  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at 1,316.48 metric tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. Global holdings
of the metal by ETFs added 3.1 tons to a record 2,072.6 tons
yesterday, according to  Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 The European Central Bank will leave its benchmark interest
rate unchanged at 1 percent at a policy meeting today, according
to all 55 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. ECB President  Jean- Claude Trichet  will hold a media briefing after the meeting. The
Bank of England will today keep the interest rate at 0.5 percent
and maintain the size of its bond holdings, a separate survey
showed.  
 Silver for immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent
lower at $17.9775 an ounce. Platinum was little changed at
$1,527 an ounce, and palladium was down 0.5 percent at
$449.10 an ounce.
