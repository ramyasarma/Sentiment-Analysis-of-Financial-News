             Japan’s government will stop
purchasing greenhouse gas emission credits from other nations,
the Daily Yomiuri newspaper said, without citing anyone.  
 The government wants to stimulate local industries and
expand employment by increasing domestic efforts to reduce
emissions, the report said.  
 The government has so far purchased 150 billion yen ($1.7
billion) in credits from overseas, the report said.
