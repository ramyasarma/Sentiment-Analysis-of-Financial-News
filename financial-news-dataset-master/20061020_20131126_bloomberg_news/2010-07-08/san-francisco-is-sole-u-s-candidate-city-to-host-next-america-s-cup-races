             San Francisco is the only U.S. city
being considered to host the next America’s Cup in 2013 or 2014,
the defending champion team said. Four European venues that
weren’t identified remain in contention.  
 Billionaire  Larry Ellison ’s BMW Oracle Racing, which as
champion sets the rules and decides on the venue, said in a
statement today that San Francisco can now “nationalize”
efforts and seek support from state and federal governments.  
 National and regional authorities in Spain bankrolled some
$2.9 billion of spending to build a marina and upgrade
infrastructure in Valencia in the run-up to the city hosting the
2007 America’s Cup.  
 “Larry Ellison has a transformative vision for hosting
the Cup on San Francisco Bay and we are prepared to leverage the
nation’s support to make this a coast-to-coast campaign and to
realize that vision,” San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said in
the team statement.  
 San Diego, Long Beach, California, and Newport, Rhode
Island, were also interested in hosting the event, the statement
said.  
 “Strong expressions of interest from four European
countries are also being studied,” the statement said, adding
that a final decision will be made by yearend.  
 BMW Oracle, with Ellison on board a boat with a motorized
68-meter (223-foot) carbon-fiber sail, powered to victory
against Switzerland’s Alinghi off Valencia in February to return
the America’s Cup to the U.S. after 15 years.
