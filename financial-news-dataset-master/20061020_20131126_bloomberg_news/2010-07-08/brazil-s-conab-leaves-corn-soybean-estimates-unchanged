             Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry left
its forecasts for soybeans and corn production unchanged in a
report today.  
 Soybean output in Brazil, the world’s second-largest
producer, will rise to 68.7 million metric tons of the oilseed
this year, from 57.2 million tons last year, the ministry’s
Conab crop-forecasting agency said today.  
 Corn production will rise to 53.5 million tons from 51
million tons a year earlier.
