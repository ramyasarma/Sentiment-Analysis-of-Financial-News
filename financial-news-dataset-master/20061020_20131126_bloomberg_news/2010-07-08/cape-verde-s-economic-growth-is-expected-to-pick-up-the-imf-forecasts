             Cape Verde’s economic growth is
expected to pick up and inflation to remain low, the
International Monetary Fund said.  
 “The investment-driven rise in the fiscal deficit helped
limit the impact of the slowdown and will likely support the
country’s growth potential,” the IMF said in an e-mailed
statement dated July 8. Still, “economic recovery in Cape
Verde’s major European trading partners remains fragile,” it
added.
