             Aquarius Platinum Ltd.  may lose 1,500
ounces to 2,000 ounces of output of platinum group metals at its
Marikana mine in South Africa after five workers were crushed to
death by falling rock in an underground tunnel.  
 The drop in production, about 0.3 percent of its estimated
attributable output in fiscal 2011, is likely if a government
suspension at the company’s number-four shaft remains in place
for two weeks, spokesman  Gavin Mackay  said by phone from London
today. The shaft makes up about half of the mine’s daily output.  
 Aquarius plans to report the results of an investigation to
government safety inspectors in two weeks, it said today in a
statement. Marikana is a 50:50 venture with  Anglo Platinum Ltd.   
 About 500 metric tons of rock fell on contract workers
employed by Murray & Roberts Ltd. on July 6 at the mine in South
Africa’s North West province, the world’s richest source of
platinum. The section of rock was supported “to industry
standards,” Aquarius said. The company yesterday said the
accident is its worst ever, based on the number of fatalities.  
 South Africa, the world’s largest platinum producer, shuts
mines after fatalities to allow it to investigate the cause of
accidents and to make safety improvements. The nation’s mines
are among the deepest and most dangerous in the world.  
 Aquarius rose 0.7 percent to 296.3 pence by 12:33 p.m. in
London after falling 6.5 percent yesterday. It has lost 27
percent this year, cutting the company’s market value to 1.37
billion pounds ($2 billion).  
 Last week, Aquarius said production at its Blue Ridge mine
would be reduced due to a safety review in the wake of two
fatalities in June.  Blue Ridge , in South Africa’s Limpopo
province, was closed for two weeks. There is no link between the
two incidents, the company said yesterday.  
 Marikana has two shafts that give access to the underground
mine, which produced 157,937 ounces of platinum group metals in
the year ended June 2009. Of the output, 78,969 ounces was
attributable to Aquarius, according to the company’s  website .
