             Japanese and Australian  stock   futures 
rose as fewer jobless claims in the U.S. boosted confidence in
the pace of the global economic recovery.  
 American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. , which receives
about 21 percent of its sales from the U.S., closed 1.4 percent
higher than the Tokyo close yesterday. Those of  Honda Motor Co. ,
a carmaker that gets about 42 percent of its sales from North
America, gained 0.7 percent. ADRs of BHP Billiton Ltd.,
Australia’s largest oil producer, rose 1.1 percent from the
Sydney close as crude oil prices reached a one-week high.  
 “U.S. employment data had been causing concern about the
strength of the recovery and expectations that jobs would
decline had been priced into the market,” said  Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa Securities
Capital Markets Co. “The jobless data shows an improvement, and
the likelihood of a double dip in the economy is shrinking.”  
 Yen-denominated futures  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September closed at 9,610 in Chicago yesterday, 0.9
percent higher than 9,525 in Singapore. They were  bid  in the
pre-market at 9,600 as of 8:05 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225
closed at 9,535.74 yesterday.  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  rose 0.6 percent.
New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  increased 0.3 percent.  
 U.S. Jobless Claims  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 1.6 percent yesterday as
a U.S. trade group said the country’s retail sales grew the
fastest in four years and the International Monetary Fund raised
its global economic growth forecast. The gauge has slumped 11
percent from its high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s
debt crisis and Chinese steps to curb property prices will hurt
global growth. Companies in the measure trade at 14 times
estimated  earnings , near the lowest level since December 2008.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped 0.1
percent. Yesterday, the index increased 0.9 percent in New York
following the drop in jobless claims and higher-than-forecast
sales at some retailers in June.  
 The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits
decreased by 21,000 in the week ended July 3 to 454,000, Labor
Department figures showed in Washington. Economists had forecast
claims would fall to 460,000 from an initially reported 472,000
for the prior week, according to the median of 36 projections in
a Bloomberg survey.  
 Crude oil for August delivery gained 1.9 percent to $75.44
a barrel in New York yesterday, the highest settlement since
June 30.  
 Fast Retailing, Li & Fung  
 Fast Retailing Co. , Asia’s biggest clothing retailer, may
be active today after cutting its full-year profit forecast on
the weakest quarterly sales growth in four years.  
 The Uniqlo chain operator cut its net income estimate 4.9
percent to 67.5 billion yen ($766 million) for the year ending
August. Sales in the three months ended May increased 4.7
percent to 188.1 billion yen, the slowest quarterly growth since
at least 2006.  
 Li & Fung Ltd. , the biggest supplier to retailers including
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., may be active today after announcing
acquisitions and agreements that may generate $1 billion in
sales next year. The company paid $140 million for health,
beauty and fashion companies and entered four licensing deals,
it said.
