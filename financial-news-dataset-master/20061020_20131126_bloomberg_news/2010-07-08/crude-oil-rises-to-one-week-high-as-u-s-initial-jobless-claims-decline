             Crude oil extended its gains in New
York, rising with equity markets to its highest level since June
30 after a report showed the number of Americans applying for
jobless benefits last week declined.  
 Crude for August delivery rose as much as $1.36 to $75.43 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange and was at $75.25 at
2:01 p.m. London time.
