             William Reilly , co-chairman of
President  Barack Obama ’s commission investigating the  BP Plc  oil
spill, said the  oil industry  could benefit from a self-policing
agency similar to one that monitors the safety of nuclear power
plants.  
 “I’m very interested in using that approach, as an
addition, not as a substitute for regulation, but as a way to
raise the bar,” Reilly, former administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview today.  
 Proposing self-regulation may be a hard sell to an angry
Congress and public, Reilly acknowledged.  
 Since BP’s exploratory, deep-water well in the Gulf of
Mexico exploded on April 20, killing 11 workers and leaving an
open wellhead, millions of gallons of oil have spilled.  
 Reilly said he presented the idea of a self-policing agency
to Obama, who was skeptical.  
 “He said, ‘I wonder if the country would accept that,’”
Reilly said. “The public did accept it,” he said, when the
idea came from “an even more reviled industry in the 1980s.”  
 The model Reilly has in mind is the Institute for Nuclear
Power Operations, an industry group created after the Three-Mile
Island nuclear power generator accident to establish and enforce
industry best practices. The institute inspects all nuclear
plants every 18 to 24 months.  
 Insurance Costs  
 “They descend on these reactors and spend two weeks, and
they just take the place apart. They look at training,
practices, adequacy and modernity of the equipment,” Reilly
said. “Then they give them a grade when they leave and that
grade is communicated to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
the insurance industry, and it affects their insurance costs.”  
 Obama named Reilly, a Republican, and Democrat  Bob Graham ,
a former U.S. senator and Florida governor, to lead a commission
charged with finding the “root cause” of the Gulf oil spill.
The commission will examine what was going on at BP long before
April 20, Reilly said.  
 He said the commission also will examine the federal agency
formerly known as the Minerals Management Service and
inadequacies in its oversight and cleanup capabilities.  
 “The response capability is so primitive relative to the
breathtaking tech advances that characterize this industry,” he
said.  
 Reilly was administrator of the U.S. EPA in 1989 when the
Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound, spilling
262,000 barrels of oil into the waters off Alaska.
