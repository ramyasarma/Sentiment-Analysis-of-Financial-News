             Indian  stocks  climbed the most in
a week after the International Monetary Fund raised the
growth outlook for the South Asian nation.  
 Tata Steel Ltd.  led a rally in raw material producers after
the nation’s steel consumption increased in June. India’s gross
domestic product may expand 9.4 percent this year, the IMF said
today, raising its 8.8 percent estimate in April.  ICICI Bank
Ltd. , the country’s second-biggest lender, rose to the highest
in more than a week.  
 “The affirmation by an outside agency obviously is a
positive for sentiment,” said  Ajay Argal , who helps manage
about $13.5 billion in assets at Birla Sun Life Asset Management
Co. in Mumbai. “The industrial production, GDP numbers have
been strong.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 180.7, or 1 percent, to 17,651.73, the biggest advance
since June 28. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock
Exchange rose 1.1 percent to 5,296.85. The  BSE 200 Index 
increased 1 percent to 2,248.74.  
 Argal expects earnings of Sensex companies to climb more
than 20 percent in the year ending March. That would be the
fastest pace in three years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. He is bullish on shares of construction and capital
goods companies, declining to name specific stocks.  
 India’s $1.2 trillion economy expanded 8.6 percent in the
three months through March from a year earlier, the fastest pace
after China and Brazil among major economies. Finance Minister
 Pranab Mukherjee  said June 22 annual growth in Asia’s third-
largest economy may exceed 10 percent in the next five years.  
 ‘Improved Earnings’  
 “The IMF report shows there is strong demand in the
economy, it’s a big positive for the equity markets,” said  Alex Mathews , head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial
Services Ltd. in Kochi, southern India. “This will lead to
higher production and improved earnings.” Mathews recommended

Ltd. ,  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.  and  Axis Bank Ltd.

according to the nation’s market regulator.
