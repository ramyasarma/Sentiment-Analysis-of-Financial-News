             Asian  stocks  rose, led by commodity
producers and banks, as the International Monetary Fund raised
its global economic growth forecast and a U.S. trade group said
the country’s retail sales grew the fastest in four years.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  rose 2 percent in Sydney on higher oil
and copper prices. Honda Motor Co. and  Canon Inc. , which get
more than a quarter of their revenue from the Americas jumped at
least 3 percent.  NEC Corp.  advanced 2.2 percent in Tokyo after
saying it aims to double its share of the world’s supercomputer
market in the next four years.  HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s
biggest lender by market value, climbed 2.5 percent in Hong Kong
as investors speculated European banks will pass stress tests.  
 “I doubt we’ll have another global recession,” said
 Masayuki Kubota , a fund manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which oversees about $51 billion in assets.
“People are very sensitive to economic data from the U.S. If
something good comes out, market sentiment easily rebounds. I’m
buying sectors which were sold on excessive pessimism.”  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 1.8 percent to 115.32 as
of 7:20 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has slumped 11 percent from its
high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and
Chinese steps to curb property prices will hurt global growth.
Companies in the gauge trade at 14 times estimated earnings,
near the lowest level since December 2008.  
 Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 2.4 percent after a
statistics bureau report showed  employers  added  workers  in June
for a fourth straight month, supporting the central bank’s view
that the nation’s economy is strengthening.  
 S&P 500 Rallies  
 Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 2.8 percent, while
the Kospi index added 1.4 percent in Seoul. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index climbed 0.9 percent. New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  rose
0.8 percent.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  declined 0.3
percent. The gauge surged 3.1 percent yesterday, the most since
May, after the  International Council of Shopping Centers  trade
group said U.S. retail sales probably expanded at an average
monthly rate of 4 percent in the first five months of the retail
fiscal year that began Jan. 31, the biggest gain since 2006.  
 Separately, the IMF raised its forecast for global growth
this year, reflecting a stronger-than-expected first half, while
warning that financial-market turmoil has increased the risks to
the recovery. The world economy will expand 4.6 percent in 2010,
the biggest gain since 2007, compared with an April projection
of 4.2 percent, the Washington-based fund said in revisions
today to its World Economic Outlook.  
 Japanese Exporters Advance  
 Growth next year is projected to be 4.3 percent, unchanged
from the April forecast, the fund said.  
 Honda climbed 3.7 percent to 2,616 yen and Canon advanced
3.3 percent to 3,445 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. , which counts North
America as its biggest market outside Japan, gained 2.6 percent
to 3,130 yen, while Sony Corp., which receives more than a fifth
of its sales from the U.S., increased 4.4 percent to 2,423 yen.
Nintendo Co., the maker of the Wii game machine that counts
America and Europe as its biggest markets, rose 0.1 percent to
26,520 yen in Osaka.  
 “The focus now is on how the U.S. economy is doing,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $450 million at Tokyo-based
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “The general consensus was
that the economy was going to deteriorate, and the good retail
sales put a brake on that view.”  
 BHP Billiton, Australia’s biggest oil producer, climbed 2
percent to A$38.16 after oil climbed for a second day in New
York. Also in Sydney,  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. , Australia’s No. 2
oil and gas producer, advanced 1.9 percent to A$42.09. Inpex
Corp., Japan’s largest oil explorer, increased 1.5 percent to
476,000 yen.  
 Oil, Metal Producers  
 Cnooc Ltd. , China’s biggest offshore energy explorer,
climbed 1.3 percent in Hong Kong to HK$12.86. Separately, the
company said it’s in “final discussions” on cooperating with
Tullow Oil Plc to develop three oil blocks in Uganda’s Lake
Albert basin.  
 Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-biggest mining company,
gained 1.8 percent to A$67.05 after copper futures for September
climbed 1.5 percent to $3.015 a pound in New York yesterday.
Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s No.1 commodity trading company, added
2.6 percent to 1,951 yen.  
 Korea Zinc Co. , the world’s second-biggest zinc smelter,
climbed 6.7 percent to 237,500 won in Seoul. The company was
raised to “buy” from “marketperform” at Daishin Securities
Co., which cited the company’s rising sales ratio of precious
metals, in a report today.  
 NEC Supercomputers  
 Newcrest Mining Ltd. , Australia’s biggest gold producer,
advanced 2.1 percent to A$34.18 after gold climbed for a second
day on speculation its decline to the lowest level in almost six
weeks is prompting some investors to increase holdings.  Real
Gold Mining Ltd. , a Chinese producer of the metal, advanced 4.8
percent to HK$11 in Hong Kong.  
 In Tokyo, NEC, Japan’s largest personal computer maker,
jumped 2.2 percent to 237 yen. The company plans to have a 5
percent share of the supercomputer market it forecasts will
reach $14.6 billion by 2014, Fumihiko Hisamitsu, general manager
of NEC’s high-performance computing division, said in a July 5
interview.  
 HSBC increased 2.5 percent to HK$73 in Hong Kong.  Li & Fung
Ltd. , the world’s biggest supplier for retailers that gets more
than a quarter of its revenue from Europe, advanced 1.9 percent
to HK$35.20.  
 People with knowledge of the European debt crisis said bank
stress tests may assume a 17 percent loss on Greek bonds, half
of the worst-case scenario estimated by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Stress Tests  
 EU regulators are relying on the stress tests to restore
public confidence in banks amid concern that some lenders don’t
have enough capital to withstand a default by a European country.
A stress test of U.S. banks last May spurred a rally that
boosted the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index 36 percent in the
following seven months.  
 Australian retailers rose after Australian jobs growth
capped the best quarter in almost four years in June.  Harvey
Norman Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s biggest furniture and
electronics retailer, climbed 5.8 percent to A$3.65. JB Hi-Fi
Ltd., the nation’s No. 2 electrical chain, advanced 4.3 percent
to A$19.30. Australian banks also rose.  
 Among stocks that fell today,  Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corp. , China’s biggest chipmaker, dropped 10
percent to 53 Hong Kong cents, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s
biggest decline. The company priced a sale of 1.5 billion shares
at 52 Hong Kong cents each, according to two people familiar
with the offering.  
 ABC-Mart Inc.  sank 6.5 percent to 3,070 yen. The shoe
retailer was cut to “neutral” from “buy” by Ichiyoshi
Securities Co. ABC-Mart yesterday said first-quarter net income
rose to 3.71 billion yen ($42 million) from 3.56 billion yen a
year earlier.
