             Arabtec Holding PJSC, the United
Arab Emirates’ biggest builder, had its price estimate cut 19
percent to 1.7 dirhams at UBS AG, which cited “rising backlog
uncertainty.”  
 “Take-home margins for Arabtec in Saudi are in single
digits below existing profile of double digits,” Dubai-based
analyst Saud Masud wrote in a report today. “Dubai risk
lingers.” UBS maintained its “sell” recommendation.
