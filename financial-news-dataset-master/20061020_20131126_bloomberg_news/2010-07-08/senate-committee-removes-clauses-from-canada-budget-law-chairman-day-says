             Canada’s Senate Committee on  National
Finance  has altered legislation implementing the Conservative
government’s budget, setting up a vote in the full Senate that
could send the bill back to the elected House of Commons.  
 The move probably won’t trigger a so-called confidence vote
that could force an early election, said Progressive
Conservative Senator Lowell Murray, who voted for the changes.
The committee took out measures including those relating to
government-owned Canada Post and  Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. 
because they had little to do with a budget plan, he said.  
 “By my count, there were 10 parts of that bill that
belonged in a budget implementation bill and 14 that were not,”
he said in a telephone interview.  
 The committee will report to the  full Senate  this
afternoon, which will then probably vote to adjourn until at
least tomorrow, Liberal Party Senator Joseph Day, the committee
chair, said today.  
 “Hopefully the government will get the message on this,”
Day said. He also opposed the original bill because it included
items such as environmental assessments that don’t relate to a
regular budget.  
 The Senate will later debate the changes and could pass the
 original bill  or send the revised one bill back to the elected
House of Commons, Murray said.  
 The governing Conservatives have 51  seats  in the unelected
Senate, and the Liberals 49. There are two Progressive
Conservatives, including Murray, one independent and one
vacancy.
