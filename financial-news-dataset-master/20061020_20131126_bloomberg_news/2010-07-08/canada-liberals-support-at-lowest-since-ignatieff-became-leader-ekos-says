             Canada’s Liberal Party has the least
support among voters since  Michael Ignatieff  took over as leader
in December 2008, an EKOS Research Associates  poll  found.  
 Some 23.9 percent of voters back the Liberals, down from
27.7 percent in a poll EKOS released  June 24 . The governing
Conservatives led by Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  picked up the
lost Liberal support, rising to 34.4 percent in today’s poll
from 31 percent last month.  
 The Liberals may have lost ground after Parliament started
a summer recess last month, which took away regular chances for
the Liberals to criticize the government, the EKOS report said.
The Conservatives may have also gained on signs Canada’s economy
is stronger than its Group of Eight counterparts, the report
said.  
 The telephone poll of 3,508 adults was taken from June 22-
July 6, giving it a margin of error of 1.7 percentage points, 19
times out of 20.  
 In the last election in October 2008, the Liberals won 26.3
percent support under former leader  Stephane Dion , the party’s
worst-ever result.
