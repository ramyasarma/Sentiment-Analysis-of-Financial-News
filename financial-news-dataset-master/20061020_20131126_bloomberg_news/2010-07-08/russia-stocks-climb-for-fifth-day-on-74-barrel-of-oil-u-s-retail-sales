             Russian stocks climbed for a fifth
day, the gauge’s longest winning streak since April, on higher
oil and a U.S. trade group’s report that retail sales in the
world’s biggest economy grew at the fastest pace in four years.  
 OAO Severstal , Russia’s largest miner, advanced 2 percent.
 OAO Sberbank  , the country’s biggest lender, added 1.6 percent.
 OAO Lukoil , the nation’s second-biggest oil producer, increased
1.3 percent, helping to push the  Micex Index  of 30 leading
stocks 0.9 percent higher to 1,339.17 at 11:47 a.m. in Moscow.  
 U.S. equities surged yesterday after retail sales climbed.
Oil rose as much as $1.03, or 1.4 percent, to $75.10 a barrel
today in New York.  
 “The strong rebound in the U.S. markets and the gain in
the price of crude to over $74 last night has only one
implication for Moscow’s bourses and the ruble today: They
should both open higher,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at
UralSib Financial Corp., wrote in an e-mailed report today.  
 Russian stocks have rebounded 6.7 percent in the past five
days. The Micex is still 13 percent down from its April 15 peak.
