             Arabtec Holding expects Nakheel PJSC,
the builder of palm-shaped islands off Dubai’s coast, to pay 40
percent owed to the United Arab Emirates largest builder today,
Thomas Barry, chief executive officer of Arabtec Construction
said in a telephone interview.  
 Barry declined to disclose the amount the company expects
to receive today. Arabtec Construction is Arabtec Holding’s
largest unit.  
 Nakheel said on June 30 it started making 40 percent cash
payment to its biggest contractors after initial payments to 
trade creditors with claims of 500,000 dirhams or less.
