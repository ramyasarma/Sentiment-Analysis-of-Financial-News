             Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. , the
Chinese automaker buying Volvo Car Corp., plans to build as many
as four factories with joint-venture partners  Faurecia SA  and
Zhejiang Limin to meet rising demand for auto parts.  
 The venture will start providing services to Geely in 2011,
the Zhejiang-based carmaker said in a statement on its  website ,
without providing further details.  
 The Chinese carmaker aims to boost sales more than sixfold
from last year to 2 million units by 2015 and is lining up
suppliers to help it expand. Geely purchased the key assets of
Australian gearbox maker Drivetrain Systems International Pty
last year, gaining technology for automatic transmissions.  
 Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. , the Chinese carmaker’s
publicly traded unit, rose 4.2 percent today in Hong Kong, the
biggest gain in more than three weeks, to close at HK$2.51.  
 Zhejiang Limin is one of Geely’s main parts suppliers.
Faurecia, based in Nanterre, France, is Europe’s largest maker
of automotive interiors.  
 Geely signed an agreement in March to take over Ford Motor
Co.’s Volvo Car division and the deal is expected to be
completed in the third quarter, Geely reiterated today.
