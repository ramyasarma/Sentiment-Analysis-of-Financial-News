             U.S. stocks rose, with the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  capping its first three-day rally since April,
as a drop in jobless claims and higher-than-forecast sales at
some retailers bolstered confidence in the economy.  
 DuPont Co.  and McDonald’s Corp. climbed more than 2.5
percent to lead the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher. Boeing
Co. gained 2.3 percent after reporting more than $3 billion in
new orders for its 737 airplane.  J.C. Penney Co.  and Abercrombie
& Fitch Co. surged at least 6.7 percent after reporting June
sales that beat estimates.  
 The S&P 500 climbed 0.9 percent to 1,070.25 as of 4 p.m. in
New York, extending its rebound from a 10-month low last week to
4.7 percent. The  Dow  rose 120.71 points, or 1.2 percent, to
10,138.99.  
 “It’s a relief rally,” said  Russ Koesterich , the San
Francisco-based head of investment strategy for scientific
active equities at  BlackRock Inc. , which manages $3.36 trillion
in assets as the world’s largest asset manager. “There’s
evidence that the global economy continues to recover. In the
U.S., some retailers are doing well. Valuations are reasonable.
The stock market may have found a short-term bottom.”  
 U.S. stocks rallied yesterday, sending the  S&P 500  up 3.1
percent for its biggest gain in six weeks, as banks advanced and
retail-sales growth bolstered optimism that consumer spending is
weathering a drop in confidence. Still, the S&P 500 remains 12
percent below its April 23 high after a sovereign debt-crisis in
Europe rattled markets and economic reports from the U.S. and
China suggested that the recovery is stalling.  
 Jobless Claims  
 Initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 21,000 to
454,000 for the week ended July 3, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington. Economists had forecast applications
would fall to 460,000 from an initially reported 472,000 for the
prior week, according to the median of 36 projections in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 DuPont gained 3 percent to $36.29, while McDonald’s advanced
2.5 percent to $69.02.  
 Boeing  rose 2.3 percent to $64.73. The world’s second-
biggest commercial-jet builder said it still expects to deliver
460 to 465 airliners this year after an 8.8 percent drop in
shipments last quarter, and announced $3.05 billion in new
orders for its 737 model.  
 Global Growth Forecast  
 U.S. stocks also rose after the International Monetary Fund
raised its forecast for global growth this year to reflect a
stronger-than-expected first half. The world economy will expand
4.6 percent in 2010, the biggest gain since 2007, compared with
an April projection of 4.2 percent. Growth next year is
projected to be 4.3 percent.  
 “It’s very encouraging,” said  Stanley Nabi , New York-
based vice chairman of Silvercrest Asset Management Group, which
manages $9 billion. “It was positive to see the IMF raising its
estimates. The combination of better-than-expected jobless
claims and good numbers from some of the largest retailers
removed some of the gloom from the market.”  
 J.C. Penney  gained 6.7 percent to $23.24. The third-biggest
U.S. department-store chain said June comparable store sales
rose 4.5 percent, beating Retail Metrics’ estimate of a 3.7
percent increase.  Abercrombie & Fitch  rose 7.8 percent to $35.45
after the teen clothing retailer reported that same-store sales
in June rose 9 percent, beating analyst estimates.  
 Gap Inc.  shares retreated 7.6 percent, the most since
November 2008, to $18.22 after the retailer said same-store
sales in June were unchanged. Analysts had estimated sales for
the company, whose brands include Old Navy and Banana Republic,
would rise 3.7 percent.  
 ‘A Little Careful’  
 “I want to be a little careful here,” said  Mike Ryan , New
York-based head of wealth management research for the Americas
at UBS Financial Services Inc., which oversees about $663
billion. “We’ve seen evidence of some good numbers which are
not necessarily translated into strong retail growth. The rate
of expansion has moderated.”  
 A gauge of S&P 500 banks briefly led the market lower in
afternoon trading after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  had its profit
estimates for 2010 reduced by Meredith Whitney Advisory Group
LLC. Goldman Sachs will earn $1.70, $3.77 and $4.64 a share in
the second through fourth quarters of 2010, respectively, down
from prior forecasts of $4.75, $4.24 and $5.42, according to a
report from Meredith Whitney Advisory.  Morgan Stanley’s  second-
quarter estimate was also reduced by Meredith Whitney, to 40
cents from 68 cents.  
 Goldman Sachs  dropped 0.3 percent to $135.46. Morgan
Stanley pared an earlier gain of as much as 2.1 percent, rising
1 percent to $24.20.  
 Risks  
 Gains in financial companies were also limited after the
IMF warned that weakened commercial real estate poses risks to
banks.  
 “The backlog of foreclosures and high levels of negative
equity, combined with elevated unemployment, pose risks of a
double dip in housing,” the Washington-based IMF said in a
statement dated June 21 after an annual review of the country’s
policies and economy.  
 Intel Corp.  led chipmakers to one out of two declines among
24 S&P 500 industries. Auriga LLC cut its share-price estimate
for the world’s largest chipmaker to $25 from $27 ahead of its
second-quarter earnings report on July 13. The firm said analyst
forecasts are “overly optimistic.” Intel will post earnings of
43 cents a share for the three-month period ended in June,
according to the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Intel fell 0.2 percent to $20.10.  
 Nvidia Slumps  
 Nvidia Corp. slumped 3 percent to $10.31. Susquehanna
Financial Group LLLP reduced its earnings-per share forecasts
for this year and next year, citing a challenging market for
personal computers and graphics. The firm also cut its share-
price estimate for the maker of graphics chips to $9 from $10.  
 Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  was cut to
“sell” by Stifel Nicolaus & Co. on the prospect a slowing
economic recovery may pressure revenue at operating units and
weigh on equity holdings.  Berkshire’s Class A shares  fell 0.8
percent to $118,900.  
 “Typically in an economic recovery, you have a phase of
acceleration, then a move from acceleration to sustainable
growth,” said  James Thorne , who oversees $2 billion as chief
investment officer for equities at MTB Investment Advisors in
Baltimore. “As you go through that process, investors become
concerned about a relapse into recession.”
