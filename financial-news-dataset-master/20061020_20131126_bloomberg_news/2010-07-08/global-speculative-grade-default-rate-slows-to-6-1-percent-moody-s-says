             The global speculative-grade debt
default rate declined to 6.1 percent at the end of June after
nine companies missed interest payments in the second quarter,
Moody’s Investors Service said.  
 The pace of defaults fell from 10 percent at the end of the
first quarter and 11.1 percent a year ago, New York-based
ratings firm said in a statement. The rate in the U.S. dropped
to 6.3 percent from 11 percent in March and 12.1 percent a year
ago.  
 Moody’s expects the global rate to decline to 2.4 percent
by the end of the year and 1.8 percent by the second quarter of
2011, according to the statement.
