             OAO Raspadskaya, the largest supplier
of coal to Russian steelmakers, along with Evraz Group SA and
OAO Severstal, will be investigated on whether they charge local
buyers and overseas customers different prices.  
 “The Anti-Monopoly Service suspects the companies of
discriminating against Russian consumers,” the regulator said
in a statement published today on its  website .  
 Evraz hasn’t exported the hard-coking coal blends that the
regulator is investigating so wouldn’t have set different
prices, said a company official who declined to be identified.
Severstal was unable to comment, spokeswoman Olga Antonova said
from Moscow. Alexander Andreev, deputy chief executive officer
at Raspadskaya, also declined to comment.  
 Supplying domestic consumers of metal products, coal and
iron ore should take a priority over exports, Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said on May 31. He also ordered the government to
determine “fair prices” for metals in a bid to discourage
steelmakers from what he called unjustified increases.  
 Raising prices as much as 30 percent is “beyond economic
logic” and designed only to recoup losses suffered during the
global crisis, Putin told a meeting of billionaires including
Severstal’s Alexei Mordashov and Evraz’s Alexander Abramov.
