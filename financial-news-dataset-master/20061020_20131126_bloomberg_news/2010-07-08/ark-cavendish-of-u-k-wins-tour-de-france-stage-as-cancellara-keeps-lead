             Mark Cavendish  of the U.K. won his
first Tour de France stage this year. Switzerland’s  Fabian Cancellara  kept the race-leading yellow jersey.  
 Cavendish of the HTC-Columbia team threw his hands into the
air as he won stage five, a 116-mile ride between Epernay and
Montargis over flat terrain. Later, he wept atop the winner’s
podium. The Briton, who won six stages last year, has struggled
to find form this season.  
 Norway’s  Thor Hushovd  retained the green jersey as top
sprinter with 80 points, 10 more than  Alessandro Petacchi  of
Italy. Cavendish rose to ninth with 50 points.  
 Seven-time Tour champion  Lance Armstrong  and other race
contenders didn’t compete for leading places, remaining in the
main bunch. Cancellara of Team Saxo Bank remains in the lead by
23 seconds from Britain’s Geraint Thomas of Team Sky.
Australia’s two-time runner-up Cadel Evans of BMC Racing is
third, 16 seconds further back.  
 Armstrong dropped to 18th from fifth overall two days ago
after a puncture and is still in that position, 2 minutes, 30
seconds off the lead. Defending champion  Alberto Contador  is
ninth overall, 1 minute, 40 seconds behind Cancellara.  
 The Tour de France enters the mountains in two days with a
stage that ends with a nine-mile climb to Station des Rousses, a
ski resort. The race ends July 25 in Paris.
