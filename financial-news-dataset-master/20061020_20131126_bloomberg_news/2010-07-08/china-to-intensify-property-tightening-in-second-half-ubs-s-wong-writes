             China will “intensify” tighter
enforcement on land policies in the second half of the year, not
reverse them, UBS AG said.  
 The minister of land and resources signaled on July 4 a
tighter policy that would spur home price drops in the second
half, UBS analyst Eric Wong wrote in a note dated today.  
 The ministry will ensure 70 percent of land supply is used
for economic housing, investigate land hoarding and more
strictly monitor terms of land sales, Wong wrote. “We remain
cautious on residential developer stocks given the renewed govt
signal that it is not about to reverse current policies, but
intensify enforcement into the second half.”
