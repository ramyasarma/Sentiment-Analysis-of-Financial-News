             U.S. stocks erased an early rally, a
day after the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  surged the most in six
weeks, as financial and technology companies slumped on concern
earnings estimates may be too optimistic.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  slid 1.4 percent and Morgan
Stanley erased an early 2.1 percent advance after analyst
 Meredith Whitney  cut her profit forecast for the two banks.
 Intel Corp.  fell 1.1 percent after Auriga USA LLC reduced its
share-price estimate, citing “overly optimistic” second-
quarter earnings forecasts.  H&R Block Inc.  slid 8 percent after
its chief executive officer quit.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,058.02 at 2:20 p.m. after surging as much as 1 percent in
early trading on a bigger-than-estimated decrease in jobless
claims. The gauge jumped 3.1 percent yesterday, its biggest
advance in six weeks.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed
16.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,034.32 after rallying as
much as 97 points earlier today.  
 “I want to be a little careful here,” said  Mike Ryan , New
York-based head of wealth management research for the Americas
at UBS Financial Services Inc., which oversees about $663
billion. “The rate of expansion has moderated. Jobless claims
came in better, but private payroll growth remains fairly
weak.”  
 Stocks rose earlier today after the Labor Department said
initial jobless claims decreased by 21,000 to 454,000 in the
week ended July 3, lower than the median economist estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. Economists had forecast jobless-benefit
applications would fall to 460,000 from an initially reported
472,000 for the prior week, according to the median of 36
projections in a Bloomberg survey.
