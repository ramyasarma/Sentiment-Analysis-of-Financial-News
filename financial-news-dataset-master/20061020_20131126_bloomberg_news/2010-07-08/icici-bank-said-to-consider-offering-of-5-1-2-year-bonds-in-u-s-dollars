             ICICI Bank Ltd. , India’s second-
largest lender, plans to sell 5 1/2-year bonds denominated in
U.S. dollars as soon as today, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  
 Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings
Plc are managing the benchmark sale, said the person, who
declined to be identified because details are private. Benchmark
typically means at least $500 million.  
 ICICI spokesman Charudatta Deshpande declined to comment.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold ICICI’s 5.5
percent bonds due 2015 rather than U.S. government bonds rose
11 basis points to 308 basis points, the widest since June 30,
according to BNP Paribas SA. The notes fell to 103.007 cents on
the dollar from 103.545 as of 3:10 p.m. in Hong Kong. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage points.  
 Moody’s Investors Service ranks ICICI’s debt at Baa2, its
second-lowest investment-grade rating. Standard & Poor’s grades
it one level lower at BBB-.
