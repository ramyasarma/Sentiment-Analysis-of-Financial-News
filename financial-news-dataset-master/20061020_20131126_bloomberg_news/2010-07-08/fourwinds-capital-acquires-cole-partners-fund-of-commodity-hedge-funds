             FourWinds Capital Management, which
manages more than $1 billion in natural-resource funds, took
over the management of Cole Partners Asset Management LLC’s fund
of commodity funds for an undisclosed sum.  
 The Tellus Liquid Commodities Fund, a Delaware limited
liability company, will be available for U.S. investors and have
its name changed to Zephyr Liquid Commodity Fund LLC, Boston-
based FourWinds said today in an e-mailed statement. The company
already has a fund of commodity hedge funds called the Zephyr
Commodity Fund.  
 “FourWinds U.S. does not anticipate making any material
changes to the fund structure or strategy in the short term,”
the firm said. Tellus invests in funds through so-called managed
accounts and third-party platforms.  
 Cole Partners, based in Chicago and founded in 1998,
conducts research and marketing for funds, according to its
 website .
