             The International Monetary Fund said
Burkina Faso’s performance under a three-year extended credit
facility to 2009 was “broadly satisfactory.”   
 “Although economic growth was below expectations,
inflation was generally low, and the external current account
improved,” the Washington-based IMF said in a report published
yesterday.  
 The IMF approved a new $67.7 million, three-year loan
facility for the African nation last month.
