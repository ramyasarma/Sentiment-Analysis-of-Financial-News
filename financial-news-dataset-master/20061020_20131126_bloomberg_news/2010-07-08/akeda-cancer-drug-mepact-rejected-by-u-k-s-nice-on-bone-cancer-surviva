             The U.K. National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence rejected Takeda Pharmaceutical
Co.’s Mepact in draft guidance on bone cancer treatment, citing
the drug’s limited effectiveness and high cost.  
 A clinical trial showed no significant increase in overall
survival in patients treated with Mepact and chemotherapy after
surgery, the agency, known as NICE, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The agency advises the state-run National Health
Service on the cost-effectiveness of medicines.  
 Takeda, based in Osaka, Japan, told NICE the cost to the
NHS of a full 48-dose course of Mepact, also known as
mifamurtide, would be 114,000 pounds ($172,687). Takeda offered
seven doses of the drug, which was introduced in Europe in
 February YHMSE9WIL6EI"></a>  
 Osteosarcoma , which effects more men than women, is the
most common form of bone cancer in the U.K. Tumors usually occur
in the legs or upper arm and around 150 new cases are diagnosed
every year, mostly in children, teenagers and young adults,
according to NICE.  
 A final decision on the drug will follow a public
consultation period that ends Aug. 2.
