             A hearing on whether to lift the
Obama administration’s ban on deepwater oil drilling before a
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals is set to begin
at 3 p.m. local time in New Orleans. The government is seeking
to overturn a June 22 ruling by a lower court judge lifting the
ban.
