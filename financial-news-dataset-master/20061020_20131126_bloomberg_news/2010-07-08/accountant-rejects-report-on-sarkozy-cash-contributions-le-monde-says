             The accountant who was quoted two
days ago as saying France’s richest woman made cash payments to
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and his party treasurer in 2007 told
authorities that the report by online news service  Mediapart 
was made up, Le Monde reported, without citing sources.  
 The accountant, Claire Thibout, told investigators
yesterday she never said that L’Oreal SA heiress  Liliane Bettencourt  gave envelopes of cash to Sarkozy before he became
president, Le Monde said.  
 Thibout also said she could no longer recall the date in
2007 of a cash withdrawal that she said was to be given to  Eric Woerth , then treasurer of Sarkozy’s Union for a Popular Movement
party,  Le Monde reported .  
 Mediapart says Thibout was quoted accurately, Le Monde
reported. Sarkozy and Woerth have rejected the assertions as
false and slanderous.
