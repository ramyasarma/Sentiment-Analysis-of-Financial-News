             Bank of America Corp. , the largest
U.S. lender by assets, hired Gareth Braithwaite from  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc  to join its team advising financial firms
in Europe.  
 Braithwaite will start in October as a managing director of
insurance and investment banking in its Europe, Middle East and
Africa division, the bank said in a statement today.  
 His is at least the fourth senior appointment at Bank of
America in the past three months as the lender seeks to increase
its investment banking division after the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression. The lender hired  Christian Meissner 
from  Nomura Holdings Inc.  in April to become head of European
investment banking.  
 “Bank of America has been through a tough time where
they’ve lost a lot of staff in the last two years,” said  Jason Kennedy 245SGIPTDE6U"></a> Rob Firth , formerly of Deutsche Bank AG, and Chris Gammons,
former head of a team at Citigroup Inc. that advised private-
equity clients in Asia, also joined Bank of America this year.  
 Braithwaite will report to  Joel van Dusen , global head of
corporate banking coverage, and Henrietta Baldock, head of
European financial institutions advisory, Bank of America said.  
 Jonathan Greenwood , formerly head of financial institutions
in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, will be
Braithwaite’s replacement at RBS, said Aoife Reynolds, a
spokeswoman for the Edinburgh-based lender.
