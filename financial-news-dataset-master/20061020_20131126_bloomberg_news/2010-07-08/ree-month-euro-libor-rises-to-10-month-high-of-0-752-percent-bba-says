             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros in London rose to the highest level
in 10 months, data from the British Bankers’ Association showed.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
was at 0.752 percent, the most since Sept. 8, 2009, the BBA said
today. The rate was 0.742 percent yesterday. The euro Libor-OIS
spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, widened to 19.9
basis points as of 11:51 a.m. in London, from 17.7 basis points
yesterday.  
 Three-month dollar Libor slipped to 0.528 percent, the BBA
said. The rate was 0.53 percent yesterday.  
 Three-month Euribor rose to 0.81 percent, the most since
Sept. 2, 2009, from 0.802 percent yesterday.
