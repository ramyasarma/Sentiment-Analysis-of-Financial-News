             The transaction that halted  Citigroup
Inc.  for five minutes on June 29 is spurring a review of
brokerage controls meant to prevent errant trades, according to
 Thomas Gira  of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  
 Finra is analyzing the trade, in which 8,820 shares crossed
at $3.3174, or 13 percent below the previous price, triggering
curbs designed to keep rapid moves from proliferating. Citigroup
was the second company to set off halts installed after the May
6 plunge that wiped out $862 billion of equity value in 20
minutes. The  order  was processed manually by a broker, said
Gira, Finra’s executive vice president for market regulation.  
 The Citigroup transaction, which occurred off exchange and
was canceled, is prompting Finra to increase its focus on
ensuring that brokers have controls to prevent bad orders from
disrupting the market. Gira said the group, which oversees
almost 4,700 firms, expects to complete an analysis soon into
what caused the broker to process the shares and which controls
were in place to prevent such a trade from executing.  
 “Isolated errors happen because of human error or system
malfunction,” Gira said. “But with trading pauses, that raises
this to a higher level of focus for us. In the past when a firm
had an error, it didn’t shut down the market for five minutes.”  
 Gira declined to identify the firm that executed the
Citigroup trade. The order at 1:03:51 p.m. in New York on June
29 was submitted to the Finra/Nasdaq trade reporting facility,
or TRF, which records the majority of over-the-counter
transactions. The  stock  climbed back to $3.80 when trading
resumed five minutes later. Almost 800 million Citigroup shares
traded that day, with more than 43 percent off exchange.  
 Circuit Breakers  
 When a stock rise or falls at least 10 percent in five
minutes, trading in the shares is temporarily halted across all
markets, under the circuit breaker program.  
 “We’re looking at the circumstances surrounding the trade
and validating that it really was an error and the firm has
adequate procedures in place,” Gira said. While the examination
isn’t yet complete, “this is a very high priority,” he said.  
 About a third of equity volume occurs away from exchanges
and is printed to one of the two TRFs Finra runs with  NYSE
Euronext ’s New York Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. ’s
main market. That includes “manual” buy and sell requests
handled by human traders at firms such as Morgan Stanley,
 Barclays Plc  and Bank of America Corp., and executions in dark
pools, which are private venues that don’t display bids and
offers publicly. Brokers that operate as market makers and
execute customer orders within their walls also report their
activity to one of the TRFs.  
 Best Practices  
 If Finra finds reason to take formal action against the
broker whose trade halted Citigroup, that information would be
made public, Gira said. The regulator could also issue a notice
advising members on best practices to prevent erroneous trades
from occurring, he said.  
 “An error in and of itself isn’t a rule violation, but
we’d be concerned if we see recidivism with firms that are
having errors,” Gira said. “If a firm has inadequate controls
in place, that could indicate a more systemic problem.”  
 Brokers are obligated to implement “reasonable procedures”
to avoid error trades, Gira said. They can vary by the type of
trading overseen, such as automated or manual executions.
“Prices relative to last sale and prices relative to the
national best bid or offer are reasonable checks,” Gira said.
“If a firm sees a trade that’s significantly away, it should do
due diligence to make sure it’s a valid trade.”  
 ‘Validation Checks’  
 Finra is also reexamining the “validation checks”
conducted on all over-the-counter transactions sent to the TRFs.
The Citigroup trade didn’t meet the price threshold that flags
potentially problematic trades, Gira said. The checks were in
place before the new circuit breakers were introduced.  
 “We’re looking at those levels to make sure there are good
protections in place,” Gira said. The triggers are scaled based
on a stock’s price so trades in $5-$10 shares must have larger
dollar moves to be flagged than those in the $1-$5 range.
“We’re revisiting those levels now,” he said.  
 The circuit breakers that apply to S&P 500 stocks will soon
expand to Russell 1000 Index companies and to more than 300
exchange-traded funds. Brokers and firms such as  Credit Suisse
Group AG , Getco LLC, and Allston Trading LLC have suggested the
Securities and Exchange Commission consider an alternate
mechanism that prevents trading below a specified level instead
of halting all transactions when a circuit breaker is triggered.  
 Price Collar  
 The agency is also considering mechanisms such as price
collars on buy and sell orders that could otherwise transact at
any level to prevent unintentional executions from occurring a
significant amount away from the market, according to SEC
Chairman  Mary Schapiro . Several venues including Bats Exchange
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world’s largest futures
market, employ these features to avoid trades that might have to
be canceled. CME Group Inc. runs the Chicago futures exchange
and Bats Global Markets operates the equities venue.  
 The first stock to trigger a trading pause under the
circuit breakers was  Washington Post Co. , which doubled in price
on June 16 before the executions on NYSE Arca were canceled. On
July 6, trading in Anadarko Petroleum Corp. was halted after a
200-share order crossed on NYSE Arca at $100,000, up from
$39.16. The transaction was voided, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Arca is operated by NYSE Euronext.  
 “Everyone will have to take a step back and figure out if
they have adequate procedures in place to avoid erroneous
trades,” Gira said. “The consequences are now more significant
than they were before.”
