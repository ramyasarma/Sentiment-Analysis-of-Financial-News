             Soccer’s governing body said it won’t
compensate fans who missed last night’s World Cup semifinal
between Spain and Germany in Durban because of congestion at
the South African city’s new airport.  
 Flights into King Shaka Airport were delayed after an
increase in private jets took up all the landing slots, South
Africa’s Ministry of Transport said in an e-mailed statement.
The attendance at Moses Mabhida Stadium for Spain’s 1-0 victory
was 1,800 below the capacity of 62,760.  
 FIFA General Secretary  Jerome Valcke  said today that the
issue wasn’t his organization’s responsibility. Spokesman
 Nicolas Maingot  had earlier said that the Zurich-based governing
body was “definitely looking into” the cases.  
 “Some FIFA executive committee members and partners also
missed the match but it has nothing to do with FIFA,” Valcke
said at a news conference in Johannesburg. “There will be no
indemnification by FIFA.”  
 Sibusiso Ndebele , South Africa’s Transport Minister,
apologized to the fans, adding in the statement that the
ministry and aviation authorities will work together to
“strengthen their private aircraft operator facilitation plans
for the remainder of the World Cup.”
