             China Gas Holdings Ltd. , the energy
supplier to homes and business on the mainland, plans to almost
double sales of natural gas in the next two years as the Chinese
government encourages the use of the fuel.  
 Piped natural gas sales may total 6 billion cubic meters by
2012 compared with 3.4 billion cubic meters in the year to the
end of March, according to a company statement today.  
 China Gas’s net income in the year ended March rose more
than sevenfold to HK$875.6 million ($112.4 million) on higher
sales. China, the world’s biggest polluter, wants to triple the
use of cleaner-burning gas to about 10 percent of its energy
consumption by 2020 to rely less on more polluting coal and oil.  
 The operator of distribution projects in 123 cities on the
mainland generated revenue of HK$3.8 billion from piped gas
sales last year. Bottled liquefied petroleum gas sales totaled
HK$4.6 billion.  
 China Gas aims to generate about 18 billion yuan in revenue
from LPG sales by 2012, Investor Relations Manager Frank Li said
on Dec. 3. The supplier also operates 91 gas vehicle filling
stations.  
 The  shares  rose as much as 3.6 percent in Hong Kong trading
today. China Gas was up 2.1 percent at HK$4.30 at the midday
break. The benchmark Hang Seng index gained 1.5 percent.
