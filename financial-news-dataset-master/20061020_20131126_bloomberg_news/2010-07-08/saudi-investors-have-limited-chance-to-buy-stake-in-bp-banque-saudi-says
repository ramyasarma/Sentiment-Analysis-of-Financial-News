             Saudi investors have a limited chance
to buy a stake at troubled  BP Plc , said  John Sfakianakis , Chief
Economist at  Banque Saudi Fransi .  
 Saudi newspaper Al-Eqtisadiya said on July 7 that a group
of Saudi investors were eying a 10 percent to 15 percent stake
in the company without mentioning where it got the information.
Sfakianakis said such an acquisition was unlikely.  
 “It is difficult to imagine that they will get a stake, as
the company has not expressed to individual investors in the
country any intention to sell shares,” he said.
