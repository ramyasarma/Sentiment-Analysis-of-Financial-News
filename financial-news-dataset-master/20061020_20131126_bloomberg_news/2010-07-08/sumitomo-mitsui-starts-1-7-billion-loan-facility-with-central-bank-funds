             Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  plans
to lend as much as 150 billion yen ($1.7 billion) to companies
in growth sectors with  Bank of Japan  funds.  
 The plan includes funds of 50 billion yen each for
environmental companies and firms planning to expand in China,
Sumitomo Mitsui said in a faxed statement today.  
 The Bank of Japan said on June 15 it would offer as much as
3 trillion yen in loans for up to four years to strengthen the
country’s economic recovery. Sumitomo Mitsui and  Mizuho Bank
Ltd.  are among 66 commercial lenders that are eligible for the
new lending program, according to the BOJ.  
 The central bank’s loan facility, which is targeted at 18
growth industries including environment and health, will be
channeled through the country’s banks. The BOJ will accept
requests from lenders through March 2012 and credit will be
extended at the benchmark interest rate, currently 0.1 percent.
