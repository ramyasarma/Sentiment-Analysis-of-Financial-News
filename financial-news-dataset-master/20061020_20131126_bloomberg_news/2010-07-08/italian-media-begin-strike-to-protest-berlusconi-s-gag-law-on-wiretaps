             Italian media began a strike to
protest Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s bill to limit news
coverage of criminal probes that involve police wiretaps.  
 Print reporters won’t show up to work today, meaning no
papers will be on sale July 9, while news agencies along with
television, radio and Internet staff will abstain tomorrow for a
 “day of silence,”  journalists’ union FNSI said yesterday.  
 Berlusconi argues that pervasive leaks of wiretaps in
Italy, one of the most bugged countries in Europe, leads to
people being tried in the press. Police, prosecutors,
journalists, publishers and opposition parties say the law goes
too far and would hinder investigations and the media’s freedom
to report on issues of public interest.  
 The draft legislation, dubbed the “gag law” by its
critics, was passed in the Senate earlier this month and debate
begins in the Chamber of Deputies on July 29. Berlusconi had
hoped to turn the bill into law before parliament breaks up in
August for the summer recess.  
 If passed, the law would make it harder for prosecutors to
get wiretaps approved and limit them to 75 days from as much as
18 months currently. Journalists would risk jail time and
publishers could be fined as much as 465,000 euros ($588,000)
for reporting the content of wiretaps.
