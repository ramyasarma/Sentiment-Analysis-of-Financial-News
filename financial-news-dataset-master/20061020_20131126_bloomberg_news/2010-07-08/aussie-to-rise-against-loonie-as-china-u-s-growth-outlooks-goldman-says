             Australia’s dollar may rise against
Canada’s as the South Pacific nation benefits from Chinese
growth and the North American country’s economy may weaken as
the U.S. expansion falters, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  
 Investors should buy Australia’s dollar targeting gains to
95 Canadian cents and exit the trade if it closes below 88.5
Canadian cents, Goldman wrote in a note to clients. The so-
called Aussie advanced to 91.27 Canadian cents as of 3:26 p.m.
in Sydney, from 90.47 cents yesterday in New York.
