             Zenotech Laboratories Ltd.  fell the
most in 29 months in Mumbai trading after India’s Supreme Court
ruled today that  Daiichi Sankyo Co.  doesn’t need to increase its
782.3 million rupees ($16.7 million) offer for a stake in the
biotechnology company.  
 Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia and Justice Aftab Alam of
India’s highest court overruled an earlier judgement, allowing
Daiichi to proceed with its year-old offer to pay 113.62 rupees
a share for 20 percent of Zenotech.  
 Investors seeking 160 rupees a share took the matter to the
Securities Appellate Tribunal, which endorsed their request in
October.  
 Zenotech slumped 13.8 rupees, or  12 percent , to end trading
at 99.7 rupees, the biggest fall since Jan. 22, 2008. Today’s
stock decline values the Hyderabad-based company at 3.43 billion
rupees.  
 Daiichi, Japan’s third-largest drugmaker, acquired an
interest in Zenotech when it bought 64 percent of  Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd.  in November 2008. Ranbaxy owned a 47 percent
stake in Zenotech, and Daiichi was required to make an offer to
buy 20 percent of the biotechnology company under Indian
takeover rules.
