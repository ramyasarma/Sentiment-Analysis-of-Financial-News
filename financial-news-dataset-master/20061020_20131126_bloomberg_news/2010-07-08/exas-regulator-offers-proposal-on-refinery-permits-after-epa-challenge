             Texas’s environmental regulator,
which oversees more than one-fourth of U.S.  refining  capacity,
proposed changes to air permits targeted by the Environmental
Protection Agency for failing to comply with federal law.  
 The plan would allow refiners and chemicals producers to
voluntarily seek state permits setting emissions limits on
specific processing units, the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality said today. The U.S. EPA said earlier this year that
permits for operations owned by such companies as Chevron Corp.,
 Valero Energy Corp.  and BP Plc didn’t comply with the Clean Air
Act because pollution limits were only for whole plants.  
 The state proposal is “the way to resolve the dispute,”
said  Patricia Finn Braddock , a partner at law firm Fulbright &
Jaworski LLP in Austin, Texas, which represents owners of some
of the 122 plants with permits challenged by the EPA. Texas
Governor  Rick Perry  sent a letter to President  Barack Obama  in
May saying the EPA’s actions were “unwarranted” and would
“kill good American jobs.”  
 Matthew Tejada, executive director at  Air Alliance Houston ,
said the Texas proposals isn’t “anything of great
significance” because companies probably won’t voluntarily
forgo their current state permits. Tejada’s group, formed in
April, seeks to reduce air pollution in the Houston area.  
 The EPA is reviewing the Texas commission’s proposal, said
 Dave Bary , spokesman for the federal agency.
