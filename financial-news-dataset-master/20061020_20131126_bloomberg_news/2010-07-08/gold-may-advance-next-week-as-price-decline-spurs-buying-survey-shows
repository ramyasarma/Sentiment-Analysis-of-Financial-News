             Gold may advance on speculation that
the metal’s drop to the lowest level in more than six weeks will
prompt some investors to increase holdings, a survey found.  
 Thirteen of 20 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 65 percent, said bullion will climb next week.
Four forecast lower prices and three were neutral. Gold for
delivery in August was down 1.5 percent for this week at
$1,189.50 an ounce at 11 a.m. yesterday on the Comex in New
York. It reached a record $1,266.50 on June 21.  
 Gold slipped on July 7 to $1,185 an ounce, the lowest price
since May 24, and is heading for a third weekly decline. The
metal gained this year as investors sought to shield their
wealth from financial turbulence in Europe and on concern the
global recovery may slow. The European Central Bank yesterday
left its main interest rate unchanged at a record low 1 percent
and the Bank of England kept its rate at 0.5 percent.  
 “Many traders and investors who have been on the sidelines
in recent weeks see the present selloff as a buying
opportunity,” analysts at Dublin-based broker  GoldCore Ltd. 
said in a report. “Until savers and bondholders are compensated
for considerable risk with higher yields, gold is likely to
remain in a secular bull market.”  
 The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling that most respondents expect a
decline. The green line shows the gold price. The data shown are
as of July 2.  
 The weekly gold survey that started six years ago has
forecast prices accurately in 182 of 318 weeks, or 57 percent of
the time.  
 This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 13  Bearish : 4  Neutral : 3
