             TowerBrook Capital Partners LP , the
buyout firm spun out of Soros Fund Management LLC, is seeking a
buyer for a German latex  producer  generating almost 400 million
euros ($506 million) in annual sales, three people with
knowledge of the matter said.  
 TowerBrook, advised by Morgan Stanley, is in the early
stages of evaluating options for PolymerLatex, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the plans are
confidential. An initial marketing document to assess interest
in the asset has been sent out and any sale process will start
later in the year, the people said.  
 There are buyout firms seeking to exit chemical assets with
high debt, and at the same time there are potential buyers who
are skeptical about the outlook for the industry and aren’t
making “best-case assumptions” when evaluating targets, said
 Andreas Heine , an analyst at UniCredit in Munich. Refinancing
PolymerLatex is another possibility, two of the people said.  
 PolymerLatex, Europe’s third-largest latex maker, converts
butadiene and styrene into dispersions and products used in
gloves, condoms, textiles and adhesives. It was founded in 1996
as a joint venture between Bayer AG and Hüls AG und Röhm GmbH,
now part of Evonik Industries AG. Other latex makers include
former Dow Chemical Co. unit Styron Corp., Britain’s  Yule Catto 
& Co., and Germany’s Lanxess AG.  
 The buyout firm has owned the business since 2003. The
latest financial results available for parent company
PolymerLatex Deutschland Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH show a net
loss of 26.9 million euros in 2008, with debts totaling 249.5
million euros.
