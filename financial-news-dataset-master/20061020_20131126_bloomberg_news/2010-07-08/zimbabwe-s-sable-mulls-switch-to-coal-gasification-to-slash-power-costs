             TA Holdings Ltd. said its Sable
Chemicals Industries unit, Zimbabwe’s largest power consumer,
will study whether a switch to coal gasification may slash its
monthly $20 million electricity bill.  
 Kwekwe-based Sable runs the world’s biggest electrolysis
plant producing ammonium nitrate for fertilizers. Eight of its
14 electrolysis units are currently consuming 80 megawatts of
power, down from 115 megawatts when the plant is running at full
capacity, TA Holdings Chairman  Shingai Mutasa  said.  
 “We plan to investigate changing from electrolysis to coal
gasification, a process that could cut our power usage to 30
megawatts,” Mutasa said in a phone interview from Kwekwe today.  
 Sable, whose fertilizer is used domestically, plans to
produce 90,000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate this year, up
from 40,000 tons in 2009. The company produces about 240,000
metric tons of fertilizer a year at full capacity, Mutasa said.  
 Second-ranked in the use of electricity in Zimbabwe are the
ferrochrome refineries owned by Zimasco and Zimbabwe Alloys Ltd.
