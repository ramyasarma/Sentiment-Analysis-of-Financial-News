             Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s
approval rating dropped 5 percentage points to 45 percent ahead
of the July 11 upper house election, according to a Nikkei
newspaper survey.  
 The disapproval rating for Kan’s Cabinet rose 8 points to
41 percent from the last survey in late June.  
 Some 32 percent of respondents said they would support
Kan’s ruling Democratic Party of Japan in proportional
representation voting, down 3 points, and 22 percent said they’d
back the opposition Liberal Democratic Party.  
 Nikkei English News didn’t provide a margin of error or the
number of respondents.
