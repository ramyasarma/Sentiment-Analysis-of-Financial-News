             Yields on asset-backed bonds tied to
consumer debt may fall relative to benchmark interest rates over
the next several weeks, according to Wells Fargo Securities
analysts.  
 “The consumer ABS market has performed well as
fundamentals continue to improve and quarter-end selling has
subsided,” Richard Gordan, fixed-income market strategist, said
yesterday in a report. “We can see spreads in that space
grinding tighter.”  
 Top-rated securities linked to credit-card payments yield
about 78 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
compared with 88 basis points a month ago, according to a Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index. Similar debt tied to auto loans
yields about 70 basis points over Treasuries compared to 78 on
June 7.  
 Investors are buying asset-backed debt linked to household
spending as late payments slow. Payments more than 60 days late
on auto loans were at 0.56 percent through April, compared with
0.64 percent a year earlier, Moody’s Investors Service said in a
June 23 report. Delinquencies have fallen for three consecutive
months, according to Moody’s.
