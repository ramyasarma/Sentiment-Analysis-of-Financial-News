             Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said she is willing to discuss a disputed natural gas
project in East Timor to help win support for a regional
processing center in that country for asylum seekers.  
 Woodside Petroleum Ltd. ’s planned Sunrise gas project can
be part of the negotiations if raised by East Timor, Gillard
told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s Lateline program last
night. East Timor Prime Minister  Xanana Gusmao  said he is
“open-minded and open for discussion” on the center being
located in his nation, Agence France Presse reported today.  
 “I’m not promising a quick fix, I’ve said that this is
going to take time, but I am determined to relentlessly pursue”
the center, Gillard said.  
 East Timor has clashed with project operator Woodside,
which favors a floating plant, over how to develop the liquefied
natural gas venture. A processing facility in East Timor will
generate jobs and “catapult” the economy, according to the
country’s president,  Jose Ramos-Horta . Woodside Perth-based
spokesman  Roger Martin  declined to comment.  
 Woodside and its partners, including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,
have said that a floating plant in the Timor Sea is the best
commercial option and would deliver the most revenue to both
Australia and East Timor. Woodside, Australia’s second-largest
oil and gas producer, has ruled out piping the gas to East Timor
because it estimates that would cost about $5 billion more.  
 Patrol Boats  
 Gillard on June 24 ousted former Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd ,
whose border policies were blamed for an influx in asylum
seekers. About 3,576 refugees arrived on 76 boats so far this
year, Immigration Department figures show, compared with 2,726
on 60 boats in 2009.  
 Gillard has spoken to United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees  Antonio Guterres , Ramos-Horta, Indonesian President
 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  and New Zealand Prime Minister  John Key 
about establishing the regional center.  
 Australia will also spend an extra A$24.8 million ($21
million) on border protection, including eight new patrol boats,
extra police and improved computer capabilities.  
 Australia will  accept  13,750 refugees and people who
qualify under special humanitarian rules in the 12 months ending
June 30, 2010, up from 13,507 in the previous year. The nation
takes in 0.6 percent of the world’s asylum seekers, Gillard said.  
 As of July 6, there were 2,567 people in detention on
Christmas Island, an Australian territory more than 800
kilometers (497 miles) off the northwestern coast.  
 About 1,503 people, who arrived by boat were transferred to
mainland detention centers in Sydney, Darwin, Melbourne,
Brisbane, Perth and regional centers in Curtin and Leonora in
Western Australia and Port Augusta in South Australia.
