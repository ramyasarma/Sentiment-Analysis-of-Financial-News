             Viacom Inc. ’s MTV Networks bought
social gaming company Social Express Inc., marking its first
move in a space that’s helped sites like Facebook Inc. reel in
users.  
 MTV, which owns online gaming sites such as Shockwave.com,
will create games with original content as well as shows and
characters from its networks, according to a statement today. It
also plans to start a platform for independent game developers.
Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  
 Social games on Facebook, like Zynga Game Network Inc.’s
“Farmville,” get 90 percent of their users to return daily,
according to a survey by researcher Inside Network. San
Francisco-based Social Express will become part of Nickelodeon
Digital, beefing up games for its kids and family group, MTV
said.  
 The first game will be introduced this quarter, MTV said.  
 Viacom, based in New York and controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , rose 39 cents to $33.04 at 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The Class B shares have climbed 11
percent this year.
