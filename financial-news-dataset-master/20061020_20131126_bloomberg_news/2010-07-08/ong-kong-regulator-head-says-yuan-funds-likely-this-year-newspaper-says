             Hong Kong Securities and Futures
Commission Chief Executive Martin Wheatley expects the city’s
first yuan investment products to be offered this year as Hong
Kong tries to become an international yuan trading center, the
South China Morning Post reported.  
 Wheatley, who was speaking at a Hong Kong Securities
Institute function in the city yesterday, declined to say
whether the commission has received an apllication for yuan
investment products, according to the report.
