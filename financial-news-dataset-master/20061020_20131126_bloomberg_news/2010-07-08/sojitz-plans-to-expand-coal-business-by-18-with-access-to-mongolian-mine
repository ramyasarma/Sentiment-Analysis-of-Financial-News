             Sojitz Corp.  will boost coal trading
by about 18 percent after the Japanese trading company won an
agreement from  Prophecy Resource Corp.  to market the fuel to
China from a Mongolian mine.  
 Coal trading will rise to about 20 million metric tons a
year in the year starting April 1, 2012, from 17 million tons,
Yoshikazu Ichikawa, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based company,
said today in a phone interview. Sojitz agreed to jointly market
power station coal from its Canadian partner’s 208 million-ton
Ulaan Ovoo coal deposit, according to a June 7 statement.  
 Sojitz joins Itochu Corp. in seeking coal from Mongolia,
which shares a border with China and Russia, as China became a
net importer of the fuel in 2009. The global energy coal market
will move into a deficit this year, and prices will rise every
year from 2010 to 2012, Deutsche Bank AG said in a June report.  
 “Our purpose is to secure Mongolian coal as a new
procurement resource,” Ichikawa said. “We will market the coal
mainly to China and are also looking to sell to Japan.”  
 Sojitz  shares  gained 1.4 percent to 144 yen at 1:55 p.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange after climbing as much as 2.8 percent.  
 The Japanese trader will start selling 250,000 tons of
Mongolian coal in the year to March 2011, and 3 million tons two
years later, Ichikawa said.  
 Itochu , Japan’s fourth-largest trading company by
market value, invested in  Winsway Coking Coal Holdings Ltd. 
in April to secure coal from Mongolia, the company said May 17.  
 China bought 126 million tons of coal from overseas last
year, according to Chinese customs data, as government stimulus
spending spurred demand from steelmakers and power stations.
