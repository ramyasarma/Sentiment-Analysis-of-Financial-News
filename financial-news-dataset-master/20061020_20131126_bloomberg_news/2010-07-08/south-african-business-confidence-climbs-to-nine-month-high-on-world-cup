             South African  business confidence 
rose to the highest level in nine months in June as the soccer
World Cup boosted sentiment in Africa’s biggest economy,
according to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  
 The Business Confidence Index climbed to 84.8, the highest
since September 2009, from 82 in May, the Johannesburg-based
chamber said in an e-mailed statement today. The index is
compiled from 13 economic indicators including retail sales,
 inflation , the benchmark stock index and the currency.  
 “The World Cup has obviously had a positive effect on
sentiment both domestically and internationally,” Richard
Downing, an economist at the chamber, said in a telephone
interview. “The main benefit is that the positive spirit and
momentum created by the tournament can be carried forward to
realize long-term economic improvement.”  
 South Africa has had “good returns” from hosting the World
Cup because it has boosted national unity and left an improved
infrastructure legacy, President  Jacob Zuma  said this week. The
number of international visitors to South Africa for the
tournament may reach about 500,000 people and add 0.4 percentage
points to gross domestic product, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said on July 2.
