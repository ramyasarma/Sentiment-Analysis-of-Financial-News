             Shares of video-game makers
including  THQ Inc. (THQI)  fell after Microsoft Corp. lowered its
forecast for Xbox 360 sales.  
 THQ fell 97 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $30.76, at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite  trading , while
Activision Inc.,  Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO)  and
 Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)  also declined.  
 Game stocks declined after Microsoft yesterday cut its Xbox
360 sales forecast to 12 million units by June from 13 million
to 15 million, as it reduces production of the money-losing
consoles. The cut probably won't have a longterm impact on the
shares or sales of video-game publishers, American Technology
Research analyst P.J. McNealy said in a report today.  
 A reduction in sales of 1 million units is ``typically not
material to any given publisher's revenue forecast,'' McNealy
said. The San Francisco-based analyst rates Agoura Hills,
California-based THQ's shares ``neutral.''  
 Shares of Electronic Arts, the largest game maker, fell 64
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $48.22. Activision, the second-largest
video-game publisher, fell 30 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $16.82.
Take-Two, based in New York, dropped 30 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $16.94.  
 Activision yesterday raised its sales forecast for the
current fiscal year to $1.37 billion from $1.15 billion, citing
improved sales of games including ``Guitar Hero.'' The  Santa
Monica , California-based company also reaffirmed its forecast of
fiscal 2008 sales of more than $1.6 billon.  
 THQ, the maker of ``Cars'' games, had holiday sales that
beat its forecasts, reporting third-quarter revenue of $475
million for the period ended Dec. 31.  
 Sales of all video-game software rose 6 percent to $7.4
billion last year, according to a report from researcher NPD
Group.
