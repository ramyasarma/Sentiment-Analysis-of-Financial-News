             Met-Pro Corp. (MPR) , the world's biggest
maker of aquarium pumps, filed amended reports for four quarters
and the full year to correct errors by an employee.  
 The unidentified worker, who wasn't an executive, violated
the company's revenue policy, resulting in sales being recorded
earlier than they should have been, the Harleysville,
Pennsylvania-based company said in a statement.  
 Met-Pro said the changes were ``non-material.'' The company
reduced 2007 sales to $90.6 million from $91.4 million and its
net income to 46 cents a share from 47 cents, according to the
statement.  
 The employee and two outside vendors used fabricated
statements and documents to mislead Met-Pro, the statement said.
The employee, who has been fired, had commission-sharing
agreements with outside sales representatives and collected less
than $300,000 through those arrangements, Met-Pro said.  
 The employee's actions contributed to errors in earnings
per share, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses,
accounts payable, accrued expenses, customers' advances,
retained earnings and backlog, the company said.  
 Met-Pro dropped 12 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $10.74 at 4
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have fallen 11 percent this year.
