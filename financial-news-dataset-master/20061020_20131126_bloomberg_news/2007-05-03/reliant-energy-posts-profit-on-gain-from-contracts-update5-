             Reliant Energy Inc., the largest Texas
power retailer, posted its first profit in three quarters
because of a gain in the valuation of energy contracts.  
 Net income was $258.7 million, or 75 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $133.1 million, or 44 cents, a year
earlier, the Houston-based company said today in a statement.
The results included a $522 million gain in the value of energy
contracts and $22 million in costs from a legal settlement.
Revenue fell 3.7 percent to $2.36 billion.  
 The company raised its 2007 forecast for earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to $1.03 billion
from $974 million. The measure doesn't include such items as
contract valuation adjustments. On that basis, which Reliant
calls ``open EBITDA,'' first-quarter profit rose to $114 million
from $45 million.  
 Power retailing, Reliant's biggest business, drove the
increase. Retail earnings were $68 million, compared with a loss
of $32 million a year earlier. Profit from plants that sell
power in wholesale markets fell 23 percent to $85 million
because maintenance projects reduced output.  
 Shares of Reliant fell 6 cents to $22.85 in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading. Before today, the stock had jumped
61 percent this year.  
 The average wholesale electricity price in PJM
Interconnection LLC, the largest U.S. power market, rose 9
percent from a year earlier in the first quarter to $66.43 per
megawatt-hour, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Contract Snapshot  
 Reliant records costs or gains, called mark to market, each
quarter to reflect market prices for power and the fuel used in
producing it. The adjustments, which represent a snapshot of
what losses or gains would be if the energy contracts were
immediately liquidated, are hypothetical. Reliant locks in
profits through agreements that fix fuel costs and the prices
the company will be paid for power.  
 Chief Financial Officer Mark Jacobs will replace Joel Staff
this month as Reliant's  chief executive officer. Staff shed
assets and cut jobs to reduce costs and debt. The company had
losses of almost $2 billion in 2002 and 2003.  
 Texas opened its power industry to competition in 2002,
forming a system where former monopoly utility companies such as
Reliant can be undercut on prices by other retailers.
