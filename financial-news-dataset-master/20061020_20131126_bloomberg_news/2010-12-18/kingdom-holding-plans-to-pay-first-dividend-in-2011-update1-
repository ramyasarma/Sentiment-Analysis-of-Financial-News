Kingdom Holding Co. , the investment
company owned by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal,
plans to pay its first annual cash dividend since listing on the
Saudi stock exchange more than three years ago.  The company board recommended paying 137.5 million riyals
($36.7 million), or 0.125 riyal a share, from retained earnings
during each quarter in 2011, the Riyadh-based company said in a
statement on the  Saudi bourse  website today. Final approval for
the 0.5 riyal annual dividend is required by authorities, the
company said.  Kingdom Holding , which sold shares in 2007, replaced some
of its management and changed businesses to drive growth because
of the global financial crisis. In January, Alwaleed transferred
180 million of his shares in Citigroup Inc. to Kingdom Holding
to enable the Saudi company to pay dividends and improve
earnings, according to a company statement.  Alwaleed , who owns 95 percent of Kingdom Holding, gave up
his “full entitlement” to the annual dividend to enable the
distribution to shareholders, according to the company’s
statement. Alwaleed sold 315 million shares of Kingdom Holding
at 10.25 riyals each in an initial public offering in July 2007.  Results  The annual dividend “reflects a move in the company’s
strategy to start distributing cash back to its shareholders,”
the company said in a separate e-mailed statement. “The company
continues to experience improving results on the path of
continuous profitability through its sound strategic plan.”  Kingdom Holding lowered its share capital by 41 percent to
37.1 billion riyals in February and appointed  Sarmad Zok , chief
executive officer of the lodging unit Kingdom Hotel Investments,
to the board of Kingdom Holding and its investment committee in
June.  Kingdom Holding  reported an increase in net income each
quarter this year, according to Bloomberg data. The company
posted a 31 billion-riyal loss in the fourth quarter of 2008
after Citigroup shares plunged during the credit crisis.  Kingdom also has stakes in Apple Inc., News Corp. and
PepsiCo Inc., according to the  company’s website . Alwaleed, 55,
ranks 19th on Forbes magazine’s list of the world’s richest
billionaires, with an estimated net worth of $19.4 billion as of
March 10.  The  shares increased  as much as 5.8 percent, the most since
Sept. 1 in Riyadh trading. The share rose 5.1 percent to 8.2
riyals as of 12:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
