 The Australian government’s banking
reform package will exert “downward pressure” on interest
rates, Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten said.            “What we’re trying to do is put competition into the
mortgage market,” Shorten said in an interview broadcast today
on Sky News. “We’re trying to improve the role of the non-four
big banks, and we’re also trying to improve liquidity in our
markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
