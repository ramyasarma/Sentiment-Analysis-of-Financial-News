Henderson Group Plc offered to pay
about 344 million pounds ($534 million) for Gartmore Group Ltd.,
the U.K. fund manager that put itself up for sale in November,
the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar
with the negotiations.  Henderson, the U.K. money manager that owns New Star Asset
Management Group Plc, made a conditional offer of 95 pence per
share for Gartmore, which it would pay with a mix of cash and
shares, the newspaper reported today. Switzerland’s GAM Holding
AG and Japan’s Sumitomo had also expressed interest in Gartmore,
the FT said.  Gartmore, whose chief executive officer Jeffrey Meyer said
last month he would either merge it with another firm or seek a
buyer after five fund managers quit, had confirmed the talks
with Henderson in a statement yesterday without providing
details.  Henderson spokesman Richard Acworth declined to comment on 
the Financial Times report to Bloomberg News today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
