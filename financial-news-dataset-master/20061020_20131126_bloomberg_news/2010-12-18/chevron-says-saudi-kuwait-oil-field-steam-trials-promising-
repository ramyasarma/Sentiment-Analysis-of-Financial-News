Chevron Corp. , the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said a pilot project to boost production by
injecting steam into an oil field shared between Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait showed “very promising” results.  Chevron is trying to boost production from the Wafra field
in the so-called Neutral Zone shared between the two countries
by as much as 600,000 barrels a day once a new method for
injecting steam is applied on a large scale.  “We have 16 steam-injection wells in the field and I can
tell you that the results that came out were very promising,”
Ganesh Thakur, Chevron’s vice president and global adviser for
reservoir management, told an industry conference today in
Dharan, Saudi Arabia.  The Wafra field will become the world’s largest project for
oil recovery with steam injection, once the company applies it
to the entire field, Thakur said.  Chevron began injecting steam at the site in June 2009 to
extract more crude. The San Ramon, California-based company is
still testing the steam-flooding technology on a small part of
the Wafra field.  The cost of the pilot project is $340 million and to apply
the technology to the entire field would cost several billion
dollars, Gary Greaser, an assistant to the Chevron president,
told Bloomberg on Oct. 19.  The decision to apply the technology to the entire field
will be made in 2013, Greaser said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
