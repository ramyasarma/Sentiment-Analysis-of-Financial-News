Saudi police arrested 38 people
after clashes near the Al-Quba Mosque in Medina in the west of
the country during the Shiite-Muslim religious festival of
Ashura, the  Saudi Gazette  reported.  Several people suffered injuries during the fights on Dec.
16, the Jeddah-based newspaper reported, citing Mohsen al-
Radadi, a spokesman for the Medina Police Department. Security
forces dispersed men, who used knives, sticks and stones during
the clashes, the paper said.  Most Saudis are Sunni-Muslims and senior clerics have
condemned Shiites for being non-Muslim because of their
interpretation of Islam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
