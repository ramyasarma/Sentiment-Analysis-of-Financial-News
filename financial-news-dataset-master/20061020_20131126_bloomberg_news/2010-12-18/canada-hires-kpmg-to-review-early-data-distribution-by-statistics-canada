Canadian Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said the government hired  KPMG LLP , the global
accounting and professional services accounting firm, to conduct
an outside investigation of the early release of economic data
by Statistics Canada.  KPMG will complete its investigation by March 31. Ottawa-
based Statistics Canada will turn over the results of its
internal probe as part of the review, according to the  statement .  Clement ordered the investigation after the federal agency,
Canada’s primary source of economic information, said it had
allowed distributors to get information as much as “59
seconds” ahead of the official release. The agency stopped the
practice on Nov. 25 after being alerted to it by Bloomberg News.  There is no evidence so far that anyone profited from
Statistics Canada’s early releases, Clement told reporters
yesterday. The agency must resolve questions about the
disclosures to protect its credibility, he said.  Statistics Canada said it is “committed to ensuring that
the information the agency delivers is timely, relevant and made
available to the public with consistency and transparency.”  Details of the KPMG probe were posted on the government
statistics agency’s website.  Statistics Canada has agreements with 10 distributors,
including Bloomberg L.P., the parent of Bloomberg News, who are
licensed to disseminate its data.  Editors: Andrew Barden, Jim McDonald  To contact the reporter on this story:
