Zimbabwe’s Deputy Prime Minister
 Arthur Mutambara  won’t seek re-election as head of a splinter
group of the Movement for Democratic Change,  Newsday  said,
citing the politician.  Mutambara has led the  MDC-M  since February 2006 after the
group split from the main MDC led by  Morgan Tsvangirai , the
newspaper said. Mutambara’s decision not to stand at the Jan. 6
election paves the way for the party’s secretary general,
 Welshman Ncube , to become its president, according to Newsday.  Mutambara, a former Rhodes Scholar and robotics scientist
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will remain a
party member though he won’t contest any national or provincial
positions, he told Newsday, which didn’t say whether he will
remain deputy prime minister in the power-sharing government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
