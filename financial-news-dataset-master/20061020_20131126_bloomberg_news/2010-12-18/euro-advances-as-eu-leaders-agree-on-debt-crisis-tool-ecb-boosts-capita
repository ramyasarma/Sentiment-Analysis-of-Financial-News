The dollar rose for a second week
against the euro as Treasury yields reached a seven-month high
on stronger-than-forecast economic data and concern Europe’s
debt crisis will spread boosted demand for the U.S. currency.  The greenback touched an almost three-month high against
the yen this week as Treasury yields lured buyers and President
 Barack Obama  signed into law an $858 billion tax cut bill. The
euro dropped to a two-week low against the dollar on concern an
agreement reached at the European Union summit this week won’t
contain the region’s debt problems. Two reports next week are
forecast to show U.S. sales of existing and new homes picked up
in November.  “The positive U.S. cycle is beginning to accelerate and
it’s good for the U.S. dollar,” said  Andrew Busch , a global
currency strategist at Bank of Montreal in Chicago. “On top of
that, we get bad news for Ireland and Greece. The positive
things for the dollar are there.”  The dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.3188 per euro, from
$1.3226 Dec. 10, and touched $1.3133, the strongest since Dec. 2
The greenback gained to 83.98 yen from 83.95 last week and
reached 84.51 yen, the highest since Sept. 24. The euro added
0.3 percent percent to 110.77 yen, from 111.04 yen.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the
euro, yen and pound, rose 0.4 percent to 80.362, from 80.070
Dec. 10. The euro has gained 1.6 percent versus the greenback
this month and the yen has dropped 0.4 percent.  Economic Indicators  Treasury yields touched weekly highs as reports signaling
stronger U.S. economic growth damped demand for the perceived
safety of the debt. U.S. retail sales, producer prices and
industrial production rose more than forecast in November.
Philadelphia-region manufacturing expanded this month at the
fastest pace since April 2005.  Treasury 10-year note  yields reached 3.56 percent Dec. 16,
the highest since May 13. U.S.  30-year  bond yields reached 4.6
percent, the highest since April 30.  “The dollar has gained strength ever since the bond market
topped out,” said  Yu-Dee Chang , who oversees $160 million in
assets as chief executive officer of ACE Investment Strategists
LLC in McLean, Virginia. “The higher interest-rate country
tends to have a stronger currency.”  EU leaders met Dec. 16-17 in Brussels, where they agreed to
amend the bloc’s treaties to create a permanent crisis-
management mechanism that takes effect in 2013, while the
leaders struggled to bridge divisions about immediate steps to
stabilize bond markets.  Germany’s Role  Germany, the biggest contributor to Europe’s bailouts of
Greece and Ireland, pushed through a proposal that would allow
financial aid “if indispensable” to underpin the euro and may
force bondholders to bear some costs of future rescues.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  ruled out putting more
money on the table, retooling the post-Greek rescue European
Financial Stability Facility to enable it to buy troubled
government bonds, or further entwining Europe’s economies
through joint bond sales.  “We’re a little bit disappointed at their inability to
approach the broad solution to the sovereign debt crisis that’s
clearly needed,”  Steven Englander , head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Radio’s “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .
“The market is afraid of a financial rupture in the euro zone.”  Moody’s Steps  Moody’s Investors Service yesterday cut Ireland’s credit
rating by five levels to Baa1 after the government was forced to
ask for external aid last month, staggered by losses in the
banking system. The ratings company Dec. 16 placed Greece’s Ba1
local and foreign currency government bond ratings on review for
possible downgrade.  Europe’s sovereign debt crisis took hold at the end of 2009
after a new government in Greece said the budget deficit was
twice as big as the previous administration disclosed. The
region’s nations assembled a rescue fund in May, which Greece
and Ireland have tapped.  The euro has fallen 9.7 percent this year in a measure of
the currencies of 10 developed nations, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The yen has gained 10.9
percent, while the dollar is down 1 percent.  The dollar dropped against most of its major counterparts
after the Federal Reserve said after its Dec. 14 meeting that it
will maintain its asset-buying program in an effort to bolster
the U.S. economy.  Benchmark Rate  The Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at zero
to 0.25 percent, where it has been since December 2008.  The pound was the worst performer against all of its major
peers. Sterling weakened 1.7 percent to $1.5533 and lost 1.4
percent to 84.91 pence per euro.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc, a British bank that’s 41 percent
government owned, said yesterday it expects to report an
increased impairment charge of 4.3 billion pounds ($6.7 billion)
because of Irish loan losses.  The Swiss franc climbed against all of its major
counterparts. It added 1.3 percent against the dollar to 0.9686
and touched 0.9559 yesterday, the strongest since Nov. 5. It
rose 1.5 percent to 1.2785 per euro and reached a record of
1.2721 yesterday.  The Bank of Japan will meet Dec. 21 to set its benchmark
interest rate.  U.S. existing home sales rose to a 4.75 million annual rate
in November, the National Association of Realtors will report
Dec. 22, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 59 economists.
A separate survey indicated the Commerce Department on Dec. 23
will report November new home sales rose to a 300,000 annual
rate from a 283,000 rate in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
