The Portuguese government is trying
to diversify potential investors in its debt so that at the next
sales it’s able to have a volume of demand that will lower the
state’s borrowing costs, Expresso reported, citing an
unidentified person in government.  The government’s aim is to demonstrate to Europe that
Portugal is able to solve its problems alone, and to avoid at
all cost resorting to the European Financial Stability Facility,
the Portuguese weekly newspaper said.  Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates has a visit
scheduled to the United Arab Emirates during January, according
to Expresso. A visit to Latin America in the first quarter is
being studied, Expresso said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
