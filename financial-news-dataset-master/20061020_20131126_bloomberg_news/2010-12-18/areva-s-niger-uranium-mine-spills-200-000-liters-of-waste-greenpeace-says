At least 200,000 cubic liters of
radioactive waste has leaked at the Areva SA-operated Somair
uranium mine in Niger, Greenpeace said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Almoustapha Alhacen who carried out an inspection of the
spill for NGO Aghir in’Man confirmed to Greenpeace that two
hectares have been contaminated by the spill since Dec. 11,”
Greenpeace said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
