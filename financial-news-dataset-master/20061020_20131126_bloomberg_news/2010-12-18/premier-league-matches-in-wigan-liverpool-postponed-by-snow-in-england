Today’s Premier League soccer
matches in Wigan and Liverpool were postponed by snow in
northwest England.  Wigan was to have hosted Aston Villa at the DW Stadium,
with Liverpool scheduled to meet Fulham at Anfield. Even though
both playing surfaces were fine, the games were postponed after
consultations with local police, each club said on its website.  “The conditions around the stadium and further afield for
people travelling to the match are such that the decision was
taken, following police advice on safety grounds, to postpone
the game,” a statement on the Liverpool website said.  Today’s remaining four games -- Sunderland vs Bolton,
Arsenal vs Stoke, Birmingham vs Newcastle and Blackburn vs West
Ham -- are still scheduled to be played.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
