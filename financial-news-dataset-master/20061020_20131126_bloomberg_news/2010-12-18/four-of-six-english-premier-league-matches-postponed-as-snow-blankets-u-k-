Four of six games in the English
Premier League today were postponed because of snow, as well as
tomorrow’s match between Chelsea and Manchester United.  Sunderland beat Bolton 1-0, with Blackburn scheduled to
meet West Ham later today.  Wigan’s home game with Aston Villa and Liverpool’s match
against Fulham were postponed this morning after snow fell
overnight in northwest England. Both teams said on their
websites that while the playing surfaces were fine, the fixtures
were called off after consultations with local police.  “The conditions around the stadium and further afield for
people traveling to the match are such that the decision was
taken, following police advice on safety grounds, to postpone
the game,” a  statement  on the Liverpool website said.  Birmingham’s game against Newcastle was postponed about
noon on safety grounds and Arsenal’s meeting with Stoke soon
followed as heavy snow fell across north London.  Chelsea said on its  website  that tomorrow’s game at
Stamford Bridge against first-place Manchester United was
postponed “following consultation with the police and the local
authority.” Blackpool also called off its game tomorrow against
Tottenham.  No make-dates have been announced for any of the postponed
matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
