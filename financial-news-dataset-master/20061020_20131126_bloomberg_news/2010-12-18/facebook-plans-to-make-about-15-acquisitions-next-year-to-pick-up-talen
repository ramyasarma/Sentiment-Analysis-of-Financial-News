Facebook Inc., the world’s most
popular social-networking service, plans to make about 15
acquisitions next year as the company seeks more people to
develop features on the site.  “They will be a mix of talent acquisitions, where we’re
looking for people to run important parts of our product, who
have a really strong vision,” Michael Brown, a corporate-
development executive for Palo Alto, California-based Facebook,
said last week at a panel discussion hosted by
 VentureArchetypes , a startup consulting firm.  That rate represents an acceleration of Facebook’s current
pace. As of early August, it made five acquisitions this year.
The company made one apiece in 2009 and 2007, and none in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
