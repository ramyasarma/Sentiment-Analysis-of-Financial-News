Boeing Co.  will confirm a seventh
delay to introduction of its 787 Dreamliner jet before the end
of the year, the Financial Times reported, without attribution.  A fire on a test aircraft in November may delay deliveries
by a further four to five months, pushing the passenger jet to
more than three years behind the original schedule, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
