The U.S. Senate voted today 65-31 to
repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” law and allow gays and
lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces.  The legislation next goes to President Barack Obama for his
signature. Before the new policy takes effect, the Defense
Department must draft regulations and the president certify the
policy won’t hurt the nation’s war efforts.  More than 14,000 service members have been discharged for
being gay since the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy was enacted
in 1993, according to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network,
a gay-rights advocacy group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
