Saudi Arabian shares rose to a
seven-month high, following U.S. equity and oil price gains
after economic data signaled the recovery in the world’s largest
economy may strengthen next year and boost fuel demand.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the world’s largest
petrochemicals maker, known as Sabic, and  Al Rajhi Bank , the
kingdom’s largest publicly traded lender by market value, led
the advance. The  Tadawul All Share Index  gauge  gained  1 percent,
the most in two weeks, to 6,563.58, the highest level since May
12, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The gauge has risen 3.9
percent since the start of December.  “Positive performance from the U.S. markets and oil during
the weekend has given support to the Saudi market for its
highest close since mid-May,” said  Fuad Aghabi , investment
director at Ajeej Capital in Riyadh.  U.S. stocks rose yesterday for a third week, sending the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  to a two-year high at 1,243.91.  Crude gained as the index of U.S. leading economic
indicators increased in November by the most in eight months, a
signal the recovery will strengthen next year and boost fuel
demand. Oil gained 0.3 percent this week, settling at $88.02 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday. Saudi
Arabia holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  Sabic  rose 1.7 percent, the most since Dec. 7, to 105.50
riyals ($28.13).  Al Rajhi Bank  gained 1 percent to 79.5 riyals.
 Jabal Omar Development Co. , a real-estate developer, soared 10
percent, the most since Oct. 2008, to 17.7 riyals.  “Investors continue to add in the petrochemical sector in
anticipation of solid quarte8rly results based on higher
petrochemical prices,” said Aghabi.  National Industrialization
Co.  gained 2 percent to 35.3 riyals, its highest level since
Sep. 2008.  Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co.  advanced 1.5 percent,
the most since Nov. 8, to 155.75 riyals.  Kingdom Holding Co. , the investment company owned by Saudi
billionaire  Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , surged 5.8 percent to
8.25 riyals after its board recommended paying 137.5 million
riyals, or 0.125 riyals a share, in quarterly dividends during
2011.  Saudi Arabia’s index is the only Gulf Arab benchmark
tracked by Bloomberg that trades on a Saturday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
