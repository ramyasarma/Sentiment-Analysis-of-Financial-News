At least one African country offered
to host Ivory Coast incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  in exile
if he steps down to resolve the political crisis in the world’s
top cocoa grower,  Reuters reported , citing the U.S. State
Department official in charge of West African affairs.  The U.S. is ready to impose a travel ban on Gbagbo, his
inner circle and their families within days if the deadlock in
the West African country isn’t resolved, according to the U.S.
diplomat, William Fitzgerald, the news agency reported
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
