Donald Fehr was elected the new
executive director of the National Hockey League Players’
Association.  The players “overwhelmingly” voted for Fehr on the
recommendation of the union’s executive board, the NHLPA said in
a statement, without giving voting totals.  Fehr was the executive director of the Major League
Baseball Players Association from 1983 to 2009. He had been an
unpaid consultant to the hockey players’ union since November
2009.  The collective bargaining agreement between the NHL and its
players is set to expire in September 2012.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
