The United Nations Security Council
has scheduled an emergency meeting on North Korea tomorrow at
Russia’s request, the Associated Press reported, citing Mark
Kornblau, a spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the world body.  The closed-door council session will begin at 11 a.m.
tomorrow, AP said.  South Korea had scheduled an artillery drill this weekend,
then said bad weather might delay the drill as North Korea
warned it would retaliate if the exercise took place.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
