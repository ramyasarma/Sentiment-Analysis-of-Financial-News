VimpelCom Ltd. , Russia’s second-
biggest mobile network operator, may struggle to get shareholder
approval of a merger with Weather Investments SpA, the Financial
Times said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  VimpelCom’s board is due to meet in Amsterdam on Dec. 28 to
approve the deal and some shareholders said the company could be
overpaying for Weather’s assets, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
