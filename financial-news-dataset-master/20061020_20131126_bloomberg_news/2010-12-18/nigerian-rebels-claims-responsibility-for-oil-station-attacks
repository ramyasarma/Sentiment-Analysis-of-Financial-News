The Niger Delta Liberation Force
claimed responsibility for bomb attacks yesterday on three oil
flow stations in Nigeria’s Delta State belonging to Eni SpA’s
Agip unit and Chevron Corp.  The attacks are a prelude to “a massive bombing soon where
oil facilities, oil well heads, major distribution pipelines to
the sea depot and refineries” will be targeted, Mark Anthony, a
spokesman for the group known as NDLF, said today in an e-mail.  The NDLF wants the Nigerian government to withdraw troops
from the Ayakoromor community in the oil-rich delta. The group
said the military on Dec. 1 killed more than 100 unarmed people
during attacks on its camps near the community.  The military crackdown followed a recent surge of attacks
by militants in the region who are demanding a greater share of
the delta’s riches, after a period of relative calm when
thousands of fighters disarmed under a government amnesty plan.
Armed raids in the delta cut about 28 percent of Nigeria’s oil
exports between 2006 and 2009, according to Bloomberg data.  Nigeria is the fifth-largest source of U.S. oil imports.
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. , Chevron, Total SA and
Eni run joint ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. that pump more than 90 percent of the West
African nation’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
