Pakistan and China signed 43
agreements and memoranda of understanding to boost trade volume
between the two countries to $15 billion within five years.  Prime Minister  Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani  and Chinese Premier
 Wen Jiabao  were present at the signing of documents during a
business summit in Islamabad today, according to state-run
television PTV News.  Wen traveled to Pakistan for a visit that may revive a
planned road-rail network linking China to the Persian Gulf.
Pakistan also hopes to sign contracts valued at $20 billion with
executives traveling with the Chinese delegation.  “Pakistan and China’s friendship is based on mutual trust
and cooperation,” Wen said at a conference in Islamabad today.  Wen flew to Pakistan from New Delhi, where he and Indian
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  agreed to boost bilateral trade by
two thirds to $100 billion by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
