The extra yield Treasury investors
demand to hold 10-year notes over 2-year securities touched the
widest since February on speculation an extension of tax cuts
will spur growth and increase deficits.  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose this week to the highest
level in seven months as retail sales advanced in November more
than economists forecast and the Federal Reserve said the
recovery is continuing. The U.S. economy grew at a faster pace
in the third quarter, a report is forecast to show next week.  “The market will be subject to selling,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of interest rates in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald
LP, one of the 18 primary dealers that trade directly with the
Fed. “It’s hard to think of anything good for bonds coming out
of the tax-cut extension. Something has got to give.”  The difference in yield between 10- and 2-year notes
increased for a third week, rising to 272 basis points
yesterday, or 2.72 percentage points, from 268 basis points on
Dec. 10, according to Bloomberg data. The spread touched 289
basis points on Dec. 15, the widest since Feb. 23.  Fed officials maintained following their Dec. 14 meeting a
$600 billion program of U.S. debt buying under a second round of
quantitative easing, saying the economic expansion hasn’t been
strong enough to reduce joblessness. The recovery “is
continuing, though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring
down unemployment,” the Fed said in its statement.  The central bank bought Treasuries maturing from 2028 to
2040 yesterday, bringing the  total  in its latest purchase
program to $129.7 billion, according to Bloomberg data. The Fed
will hold two buybacks on Dec. 20.  Benchmark Note  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was little changed
at 3.326 percent yesterday, from 3.325 percent on Dec. 10,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent security
maturing in November 2020 traded at 94 1/8.  The 10-year note yield touched 3.56 percent on Dec. 16, the
highest level since May 13. A gain in two-year notes this week
pushed the yield down three basis points to 0.61 percent. It
touched 0.69 percent Dec. 13, the highest level since June 23.  President  Barack Obama  signed into law yesterday an $858
billion bill extending for two years all tax cuts enacted during
the administration of  George W. Bush . Congress passed the
measure this week.  Retail sales  gained 0.8 percent last month as Americans
began holiday shopping, the Commerce Department reported Dec.
14. The median forecast of 77 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for an increase of 0.6 percent.  U.S. Economic Growth  The U.S. economy grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter from
a year earlier, faster than the 2.5 percent estimate issued last
month, according to the median forecast of 61 economists before
the Commerce Department’s report Dec. 22. Gross domestic product
advanced 1.7 percent in the second quarter.  “The data has improved, and the tax package has
contributed to the rise in yields,” said  David Ader , head of
government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. “One needs to adjust what they were thinking next
year to accommodate it.”  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE  index , which measures
volatility in Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter
options maturing in 2 to 30 years, rose on Dec. 15 to 125.20,
the highest level since September 2009.  Treasuries rallied over the past two days as yields near a
seven-month high attracted investors.  The 10-year yield fell 20 basis points on Dec. 16-17, the
most since a decrease of 22 basis points during the two days
ended June 7, after the U.S. payrolls report showed employers
added fewer jobs than forecast.  Relative Strength  The 14-day relative strength index on the 10-year  yield  was
at 62 yesterday after increasing to 74.384 on Dec. 15, the
highest since May 2009, according to Bloomberg data. Readings at
or above 70 typically indicate yields are poised to fall.  Bonds rose yesterday as Moody’s Investors Service lowered
Ireland’s credit rating five levels to Baa1 from Aa2. Moody’s
also this week placed Greece’s Ba1 local and foreign currency
government bond ratings on review for possible downgrade.  European Union leaders agreed to amend the bloc’s treaties
to create a permanent crisis-management mechanism in 2013, with
Germany refusing to boost the current 750 billion-euro ($1
trillion) emergency fund for the most indebted countries.  “There are still worries coming out of Europe that are
lingering that are still supportive of the Treasury market,”
said  Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government trading in New
York at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a brokerage for institutional
investors. “The market will trade volatile and illiquid into
the end of the year as people wind down their positions. The
action should be very choppy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
