LeBron James scored 32 points in his
first appearance with Miami in New York, leading the Heat to a
113-91 victory against the Knicks.  James, who was courted by the Knicks as a free agent before
signing with Miami in July, was booed nearly every time he
touched the ball. He responded by hitting 14 of 23 shots and
adding 11 rebounds and 10 assists as the Heat won its 11th
straight game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
