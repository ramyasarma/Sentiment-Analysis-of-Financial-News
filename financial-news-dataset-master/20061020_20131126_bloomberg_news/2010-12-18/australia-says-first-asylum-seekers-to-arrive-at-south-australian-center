Australia’s Immigration Minister
Chris Bowen said the first group of 81 asylum seekers to be
housed at the Inverbrackie facility in South Australia will
arrive today.  The “low-risk” group, including Sri Lankans, Iranians,
Iraqis and Kurds, are on the way from Darwin, Bowen said in an
e-mailed statement. Up to 400 asylum seekers will eventually be
held at the facility, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
