Australia set England 391 to win the
third Ashes cricket Test in Perth after Mike Hussey’s century
lifted the home team to 309 all out in its second innings on day
three.  Hussey, Australia’s top run scorer in the best-of-five
contest, was the last man out for 116 shortly after the tea
break at the WACA Ground. Opener Shane Watson earlier made 95,
while Chris Tremlett was England’s best bowler with 5-87.  Australia is seeking to level the series at 1-1 following
defeat in Adelaide. A victory for England at the WACA would give
it an unbeatable 2-0 lead and see it retain the Ashes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
