U.S. Ambassador to China  Jon Huntsman  said China is letting its currency appreciate because
it’s in the country’s “immediate interest,” not just because
of pressure from the U.S. and Europe.  “Inflation is on the horizon, they’re trying to transition
from the largest export power ever assembled in the history of
the world to a consumer-based model, and in order to do that,
you’ve got to have a properly valued currency,” Huntsman said
in an interview on the “ Charlie Rose ” show that aired
yesterday on U.S. public television.  President  Barack Obama  is pressing his Chinese counterpart
 Hu Jintao  to allow faster currency appreciation to help narrow
trade imbalances that threaten to trigger protectionism and
imperil the global economic recovery.  Huntsman called the appreciation “painfully slow.”  China, which has held the yuan’s  rise  to about 2.5 percent
since a two-year dollar peg was removed in June, has argued that
letting its currency appreciate more quickly could cause social
and economic disruption.  Huntsman also said he expects some “ideological rigidity”
leading up to leadership changes in China in 2012, after which
there probably will be a period of reform.  “If I were looking ahead, I would say the years 2013 to
2015, 2016 are going to be pretty important from a reform
standpoint.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
