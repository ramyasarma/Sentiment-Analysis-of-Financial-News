U.S. stocks rose for a third week,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a two-year high, as
stronger-than-estimated data on retail sales, manufacturing and
housing boosted confidence in the economic recovery.  Kraft Foods Inc.,  Caterpillar Inc.  and DuPont Co. advanced
at least 2.5 percent to lead the gains in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.  Oracle Corp.  advanced 5.1 percent after the
second-largest software maker forecast earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Marshall & Ilsley Corp.  soared 16 percent
as Bank of Montreal agreed to buy the lender for $4.1 billion.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent to 1,243.91, completing a
three-week rally, the longest stretch since Nov. 5. The  Dow 
added 81.59 points, or 0.7 percent, to 11,491.91.  “Optimism on the economy has turned the corner,” said
 Quincy Krosby , chief market strategist for Newark, New Jersey-
based Prudential Financial Inc., which oversees $690 billion.
“Corporate earnings are strong, and we expect profits to
continue to be solid. That’s fueling investor confidence.”  The S&P 500 has risen 13 of the past 16 weeks, which last
happened in 2004, according to  Howard Silverblatt , S&P’s New
York-based senior index analyst. It has risen 84 percent from a
12-year low in March 2009 as corporate profits beat estimates,
the economy improved and the Federal Reserve bought assets to
boost growth. The index failed this week to reach 1,251.70,
which would mark the full recovery of the six-month 46 percent
drop following Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 collapse.  Picking Up Speed  The U.S. economy is picking up speed and may grow by 3
percent to 3.5 percent next year, former Federal Reserve
Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said. The economy grew at annualized
pace of 2.5 percent in the third quarter. Recent statistics on
retail sales and falling unemployment claims suggest it is
gaining ground.  “The U.S. economy unquestionably has some momentum,” he
said in a Dec. 16 interview in Washington. “The fourth quarter
looks good. The growth rate could be 3.5 percent or more” for
the final quarter of this year.  Kraft , the world’s second-largest food company, rallied 3.8
percent to $31.93. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of
construction and mining equipment, gained 3 percent to $92.59.
DuPont, the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker, slid 2.6 percent
to $49.86.  Oracle  jumped 5.1 percent to $31.46. Profit for the current
quarter was higher than analysts forecast on average, adding to
evidence that Oracle benefiting from an acquisition-fueled
expansion into computer hardware. Profit excluding certain
expenses will be 48 cents to 50 cents a share. That tops the 47-
cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  M&A  Marshall & Ilsley soared 16 percent to $6.85. Bank of
Montreal agreed to pay 0.1257 of its own stock for each share of
the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based lender to expand its Chicago-
based Harris Bank. The deal values M&I at $7.75 a share, 34
percent higher than Dec. 16 closing price of $5.79.  As Marshall & Ilsley gained,  financial stocks  in the S&P
500 lost 1.4 percent, the most among 10 groups, amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis is worsening. Moody’s Investors Service
yesterday cut Ireland’s credit rating by five levels yesterday,
citing its declining financial strength and the cost of bailing
out lenders. Separately, Moody’s placed six Greek banks on
review for a potential downgrade, one day after it put the
country’s Ba1 bond ratings on the watch list for a possible cut.  ‘Bleeding’  “Most people think that the bleeding had stopped,” said
 Matt McCormick , a money manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl &
Gaynor Inc., which has $3 billion in assets. “I disagree. We’ll
probably see more bad news coming out of Europe. The market is
too complacent at this point.”  The benchmark index for U.S. stock options fell to the
lowest since April. The VIX, as the  Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index  is known, dropped 8.5 percent to 16.11
this week. The index, which measures the cost of using options
as insurance against declines in the S&P 500, is down from this
year’s peak of 45.79 in May.  Best Buy Co.  sank 18 percent to $34.27 for the biggest
retreat in the S&P 500. The world’s largest consumer-electronics
retailer reported third quarter earnings excluding some items of
54 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate of 60
cents. Best Buy also forecast annual earnings of $3.40 a share
at most. On average, the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated profit of $3.59 a share.  Credit Card Companies  Visa Inc. declined 17 percent to $66.90, while  MasterCard
Inc.  fell 13 percent to $221.26. The world’s two largest credit-
card companies may face permanent damage to the fastest-growing
part of their business after the Federal Reserve proposed rules
that could cut debit-card transaction fees by 84 percent. “It
is negative all around,” wrote  Scott Valentin , an analyst at
FBR Capital Markets, in a note to clients. “This significantly
impacts the business model for the networks.”  Quarterly reports scheduled for next week include  Adobe
Systems Inc. , the top maker of graphic-design software, and Nike
Inc., the world’s largest maker of athletic shoes.  Carnival
Corp. , the world’s biggest cruise-line operator; Walgreen Co.,
the largest U.S. drugstore chain;  Micron Technology Inc ., the
largest U.S. maker of computer-memory chips; and ConAgra Foods
Inc., the maker of Banquet and Healthy Choice dinners, are also
due to report results.  Spending by U.S. consumers and businesses probably
accelerated in November, a signal the economy was speeding up at
the end of the year, economists forecast before reports this
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
