Today’s English Premier League
soccer matches in Wigan, Liverpool and Birmingham were postponed
by snow.  Wigan was to play Aston Villa, Liverpool was to meet Fulham
and Birmingham was to take on Newcastle. All were postponed
after consultations with local police, each club said on its
website.  “Although the Anfield pitch is playable, the conditions
around the stadium and further afield for people traveling to
the match are such that the decision was taken, following police
advice on safety grounds, to postpone the game,” a statement on
the Liverpool website said.  Today’s remaining three games -- Sunderland vs Bolton,
Arsenal vs Stoke and Blackburn vs West Ham -- are still
scheduled to be played.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
