European Union rules for carbon
permits after 2012 will burden German steel companies with
almost 200 million euros ($264 million) a year, Handelsblatt
 reported , citing unidentified people in government.  The new rules, agreed this week, will tax the steel,
chemical, cement, paper, glass and aluminum industries, the
newspaper said. ThyssenKrupp AG Chief Executive Ekkehard Schulz
in a letter to the office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel
“complained” that the government agreed to the rules,
according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
