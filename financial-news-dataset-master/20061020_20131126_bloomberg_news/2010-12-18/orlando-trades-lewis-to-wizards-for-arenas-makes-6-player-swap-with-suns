The Orlando Magic remade their
roster with a pair of trades, acquiring  Gilbert Arenas  from the
Washington Wizards and three players from the Phoenix Suns.  The Magic, who have lost six of their last seven games,
made a six-player deal yesterday with Phoenix that brought  Hedo Turkoglu  back to Orlando along with  Jason Richardson  and  Earl Clark . The Suns will get  Vince Carter ,  Marcin Gortat  and  Mickael Pietrus .  Orlando earlier sent  Rashard Lewis  to the Wizards for
Arenas in a swap of former All-Stars. The Wizards have been open
to trading Arenas since making point guard  John Wall  the No. 1
pick in the 2010 draft.  Arenas was suspended by the National Basketball Association
for the final 50 games of last season after a locker room
incident involving guns.  “I always say that good people sometimes make stupid
decisions,” Magic General Manager  Otis Smith , who knows Arenas
from their days together with the Golden State Warriors, told
reporters.  Arenas, 28, a three-time All-Star, started his career with
Golden State in 2001-02 and spent two seasons there before
joining the Wizards for the past eight seasons.  Arenas was limited to 47 games the previous three seasons
because of knee problems. He has averaged 17.3 points per game
this season, including a season-high 31 points in a loss to the
Magic on Nov. 27. He has three years and $62.4 million remaining
on his contract after this season.  Lewis, 31, a two-time All-Star who averaged more than 14
points a game in each of his previous 10 seasons, is averaging
12.2 points per game this season. He is making $20.5 million
this season and is owed $45.8 million over the next two years.  Turkoglu played in Orlando in 2004-09, helping the Magic
reach the NBA Finals in 2009. He moved to Toronto last season
and was traded to the Suns before this season.  Because of the trades, Orlando (16-10) had only eight
players available last night in a 97-89 home loss to the
Philadelphia 76ers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
