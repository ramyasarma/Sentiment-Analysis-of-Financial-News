Australia reduced England to 81-5 at
stumps on day three of the third Ashes cricket Test in Perth,
closing to within five wickets of a series-tying win after
setting the touring team 391 for victory.  Australia removed Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Kevin
Pietersen, Jonathan Trott and Paul Collingwood in the final
session at the WACA Ground after Mike Hussey’s 116 led the home
team to 309 in its second innings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
