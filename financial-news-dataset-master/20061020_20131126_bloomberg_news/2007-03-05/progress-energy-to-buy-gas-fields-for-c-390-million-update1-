             Progress Energy Trust agreed to
acquire oil and gas fields in northeast British Columbia and
northwest  Alberta  for C$390.3 million ($330.7 million), boosting
production by a third.  
 Progress Energy will gain production of 6,400 barrels of oil
equivalent a day through its acquisition of a closely held
company, the Calgary-based company said today in a statement.  
 The fields are 95 percent natural gas and add to the trust's
production of about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, said
Progress Energy spokesman Greg Kist in a telephone interview. The
purchase will almost double the trust's undeveloped exploration
property in the area to 600,000 acres.  
 ``This is very much an exploration-and-production company
type of acquisition, this is really an ideal fit within our own
backyard,'' Kist said.  
 Progress Energy's production will be about 87 percent
natural gas once the transaction is completed, up from 80
percent, Kist said. The company is increasing its natural-gas
holdings at a time when prices are dropping. Natural-gas prices
have fallen about 15 percent in the past year in New York.  
 The trust said it bought production for the equivalent of
C$49,800 barrels of oil day. The average transaction price in the
fourth quarter ranged between C$50,000 and C$55,000, based on
data prepared by Calgary-based Sayer Energy Advisers.  
 Taxing Trusts  
 Progress financed the acquisition by selling 21 million
subscription receipts to a group of banks for C$12 each, raising
C$252 million. Bank of Montreal, the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada, are
leading the banking group, the trust said.  
 Progress is issuing the receipts at a 3.2 percent discount
to its share price today of C$12.40 before trading was halted on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.  
 Asset purchases by trusts had slowed since Oct. 31 when the
Canadian government announced plans to begin taxing them for the
first time in 2011. The tax raises costs for trusts to finance
transactions and reduces the value of their units.  
 In October, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said to
stem a loss of tax revenue new trusts would immediately be
taxable and existing trusts are grandfathered until 2011. Income
trusts avoid most corporate taxes by paying their cash flow to
investors as monthly dividends.  
 BMO Capital Markets, the investment banking arm of the Bank
of Montreal, advised Progress on today's transaction.
