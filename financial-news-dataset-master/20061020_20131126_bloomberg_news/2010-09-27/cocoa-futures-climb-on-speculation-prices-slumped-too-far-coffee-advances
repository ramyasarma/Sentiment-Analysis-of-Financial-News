Cocoa rose to a five-week high on
speculation that a recent slump will prompt chocolate makers and
other consumers to add to their inventories. Coffee also gained.  People “aren’t going to hold out” on buying supplies at
these prices, said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist
at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. Cocoa has dropped 8.8 percent since
June 24.  “We’ve fallen dramatically in the last three months, and
this is really part of an oversold corrective bounce,” said
 Luis A. Rangel , a broker at ICAP Futures LLC in Jersey City, New
Jersey. “The market has gotten itself into a very oversold
position.”  Cocoa for December delivery rose $45, or 1.6 percent, to
settle at $2,839 a metric ton at 11:58 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price reached $2,850, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Aug. 23.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators cut their
net-short position, or bets prices will fall, in cocoa futures
by 22 percent in the week ended Sept. 21, according to
government data.  The commodity has dropped 14 percent this year on signs of
increasing supply. Production may exceed demand by 75,000 tons,
plus or minus 25,000 tons, in the season that starts next month,
the  International Cocoa Organization  has forecast.  “Most people are thinking they should put a little extra
premium to the market until they see what actually comes
about,” in terms of crop production, said  Hector Galvan , a
senior trading adviser at RJO Futures in Chicago.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery gained 17
pounds, or 0.9 percent, to 1,900 pounds ($3,011) a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery climbed 1.65
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.8225 a pound in New York. In
London, robusta-coffee futures for November delivery gained $9,
or 0.5 percent, to $1,736 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
