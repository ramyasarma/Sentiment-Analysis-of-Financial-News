Demand for cotton in China, the
world’s largest buyer and grower, outstripped domestic
production by 3.6 million metric tons in 2009-2010, widening a
supply deficit,  the China Cotton Association  said today.  The gap increased by 2.6 million tons from the previous
year, the group said, citing Zhang Xiaoqiang, deputy head of
the National Development and Reform Commission.  “A recovery in the textile industry coupled with a drop
in production because of lower income from cotton planting has
resulted in a relatively big change in the demand and supply
balance,” the association said, citing Zhang in a government
meeting on cotton.  China’s domestic cotton production fell by 14.7 percent to
6.4 million tons in the year ended Aug. 31, Zhang was quoted as
saying. Yarn production expanded by 16.6 percent in the same
period to 26.41 million tons, driving a total demand for cotton
to 10.6 million tons, he added.  China has sold the natural fiber from government
stockpiles in auctions to bridge the supply gap, offloading
1.1 million tons during September and December and another
230,000 tons between Aug. 10-31, Zhang said. The country’s
cotton imports jumped 73 percent from a year ago to 2.51
million tons.  Standard cotton prices in China have climbed 29.3 percent
in 2009-2010 to an average 15,724 yuan ($2,347) a ton, pacing
the gain in the international cotton market, the report said.  More Sales  China will auction a further 300,000 tons to 400,000 tons
of cotton from state reserves to satisfy demand from the
textile industry, industry researcher cncotton.com said
yesterday in a report.  The country will release the additional cotton following a
decision to sell 600,000 tons starting Aug. 10, the report said.  Cotton in Zhengzhou reached a record of 22,000 yuan a ton
today as supplies tightened on increased demand for yarn and
reduced output. Prices have climbed 28 percent since the
government started auctioning state reserves on Aug. 10.  -- Feiwen Rong . Editors: Richard Dobson, Tan Hwee Ann.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
