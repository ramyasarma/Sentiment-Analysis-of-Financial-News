(Corrects name of company in headline.)  Mumias Sugar Co., Kenya’s largest
producer of the sweetener, jumped the most in more than two
weeks after signing a 1.6 billion-shilling ($20 million) loan to
build an ethanol power plant.  The company’s stock gained as much as 30 cents, or 2.6
percent, to 12 shillings before trading 1.7 percent higher at
11.90 shillings as of 12:32 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  The funds, which will be provided by the Kenyan unit of
 Ecobank Transnational Inc.  and  Commercial Bank of Africa ,
Kenya’s biggest closely held bank, will go toward building a 3.6
billion-shilling plant, the company said in a statement handed
to reporters today. Half of the cost of the plant be funded with
debt and the rest will be paid with equity, it said.  “The plant is expected to produce about 22 million liters
(5.8 million gallons) of ethanol annually when complete,” the
statement said.  Last year, Kenya passed a law for gasoline to be blended
with 10 percent ethanol. Blending will start in September at
Kenya Pipeline Co. depots in the western towns of Eldoret,
Kisumu and Nakuru, Nairobi-based Daily Nation said Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
