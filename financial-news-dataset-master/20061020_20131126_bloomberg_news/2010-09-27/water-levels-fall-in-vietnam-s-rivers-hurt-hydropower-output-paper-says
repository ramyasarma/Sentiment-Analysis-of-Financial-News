Water levels fell in Vietnamese
rivers, and hurt the country’s hydropower production, Sai Gon
Giai Phong newspaper reported on its website, citing the
National Hydrology and Meteorology Bureau.  Water level in Red river in the north fell to 3.8 meters
yesterday and will drop to around 3.55 meter by tomorrow
morning, Sai Gon Gia Phong said. Water levels in reservoirs for
hydropower production also dropped, with about 2 billion cubic
meter of water less than the same time last year, it said.  Vietnam’s electricity demand may rise as much as 18 percent
as the economy expands by 6.7 percent this year and 7.5 percent
in 2011, according to government estimates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
