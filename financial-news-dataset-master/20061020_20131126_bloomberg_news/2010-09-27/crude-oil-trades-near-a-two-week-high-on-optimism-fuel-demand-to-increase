Oil pared earlier gains as equities
gave up some of their advance and the dollar strengthened,
dimming the appetite for alternative investments such as
commodities.  Oil rose to a two-week high earlier after data showed
renewed equipment purchases by U.S. factories and businesses.
The euro weakened from a five-month high against the dollar as
speculation European banks will need more funds curbed demand
for assets in the 16-nation region.  Crude for November delivery was at $76.45 a barrel, down 4
cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 10:10 a.m. London
time. The contract earlier climbed as much as 39 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $76.88, the highest since Sept. 14. Brent crude oil
for November settlement slipped 19 cents to $78.68 on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.2 percent at 264.44,
having advanced as much as 0.5 percent to 265.15.  U.S.  durable goods orders , not including volatile
transportation items, increased a more-than-expected 2 percent
in August. Capital equipment purchases rebounded 4.1 percent
after falling in July, the Commerce Department said Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
