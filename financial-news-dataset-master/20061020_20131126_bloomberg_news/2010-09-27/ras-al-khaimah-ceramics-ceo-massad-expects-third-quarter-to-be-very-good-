Ras Al Khaimah Ceramics, a producer
of tiles and bathroom fixtures, boosted sales and profit by 10
percent this year and expects the growth to continue thorugh the
end of 2010, the chief executive officer said.  Production is “fully booked” for the next month and a
half, Khatter Massad said today. The “third quarter will
definitely be very good. We’re on track and above budget,” he
said.  RAK Ceramics, based in the United Arab Emirates sheikhdom
of Ras Al Khaimah, is entering “a lot of new markets and
diversifying,” Massad said. “In Iraq we’re doing very well.
Yemen, Morocco and Egypt we’re penetrating very well,” he said.
“We’re increasing our presence in Germany, and production there
rose 25 percent this year.”   To contact the reporter on this story:
