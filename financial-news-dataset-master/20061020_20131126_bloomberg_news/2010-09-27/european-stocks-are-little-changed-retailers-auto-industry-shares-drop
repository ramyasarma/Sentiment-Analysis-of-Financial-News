European stocks were little changed
as gains by food and beverage companies offset declines in
retailers and auto-industry shares.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose less than 0.1 percent to
264.01 at 11:35 a.m. in London, having earlier climbed as much
as 0.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
