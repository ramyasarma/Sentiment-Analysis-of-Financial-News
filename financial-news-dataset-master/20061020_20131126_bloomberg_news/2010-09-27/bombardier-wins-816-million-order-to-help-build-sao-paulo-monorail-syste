Bombardier Inc. said today that its
share of a winning order for a monorail system in Sao Paulo is
$816 million.  The deal for the 24-kilometer (14.9-mile) Expresso
Tiradentes mass-transit line is valued at 2.46 billion reals
($1.44 billion), according to a company statement. Bombardier,
based in Montreal, will team with two members of the Express
Monotrilho Leste Consortium, or Eastern Express Monorail
Consortium, a group that includes Brazilian companies, to
design, supply and install the system.  The line, which will carry 500,000 passengers daily, will
reduce an almost two-hour trip to about 50 minutes, Bombardier
said. The world’s third-largest commercial planemaker has
supplied similar rail systems in four U.S. cities and Saudi
Arabia, the company said.  “Our new INNOVIA Monorail 300 system for Sao Paulo is a
game changer in the industry, as it allows fast construction of
high-capacity transit lines,” Eran Gartner, systems division
president of Bombardier Transportation, said in the statement.  Bombardier dropped 4 cents to C$4.86 at 12:51 p.m. in
Toronto trading. The shares had gained 2.1 percent this year
before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
