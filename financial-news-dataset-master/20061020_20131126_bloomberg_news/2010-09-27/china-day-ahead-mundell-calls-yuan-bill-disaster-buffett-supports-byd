Nobel-Prize winning economist
 Robert Mundell  said U.S. legislation to press China to raise the
value of the yuan would be a “disaster” and fail to narrow the
trade deficit between the two nations.  “This is not going to help Americans,” Mundell said in a
Bloomberg Television interview in Hong Kong. “This is not going
to create jobs for Americans. It’s just going to create a
disaster.”  U.S. lawmakers will vote in two days on legislation that
would let American companies petition for higher duties on
imports from China to compensate for the effect of a weak
currency.  Buffett Backs BYD  Billionaire  Warren Buffett  affirmed his support for  BYD Co .,
saying the Chinese automaker part-owned by his  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.  will be a leader in electric cars. The stock
gained the most since July after the company said it has a
dealer network for its plug-in hybrids.  “BYD is a young and promising company experiencing dynamic
growth,” Buffett said yesterday during his first visit to the
southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, where the manufacturer is
based. “BYD will play a leading role in the future.”  The stock rose 4.3 percent yesterday, the most since July 6,
as BYD said it has signed 30 dealers to market the F3DM plug-in
hybrid in 20 Chinese cities. Buffett spoke after the market
closed.  China Sells U.S. Home-Loans  A  record  tumble in the holdings of U.S. agency debt and
government-backed mortgage bonds by central banks and similar
foreign investors probably reflected sales of home-loan
securities by China, according to Wrightson ICAP LLC.  The amount of debt, including notes that fund government-
supported mortgage financier  Fannie Mae , held by official
foreign investors plunged $57 billion in the week ended Sept. 15
to $752.5 billion, according to Federal Reserve  data . The
category also encompasses mortgage-backed securities, or MBS,
backed by loans on U.S. houses and condominiums.  LDK Gets Loan  LDK Solar Co. , a Chinese solar wafer maker whose shares
have risen more than 80 percent this quarter, agreed to borrow
as much as 60 billion yuan ($8.9 billion) from  China Development
Bank  to help fund its expansion.  The 5-year credit facility will support the Jiangxi-based
company’s growth plans and strengthen its market position, it
said in a  statement .  Unicom Bond Sale  China Unicom  (Hong Kong) Ltd. is seeking to raise about
$1.8 billion in a convertible-bond issue, Dow Jones Newswires
said, citing a term sheet, in a report published on the Wall
Street Journal’s website.  The five-year notes will have an annual coupon of 0.5
percent to 1.0 percent, and an initial conversion price of
HK$15.56 to HK$16.15 per share, the news agency said.  Nomura
Holdings Inc .,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and  China International
Capital Corp . are organizing the sale, Dow Jones said.  GE, Harbin Power Venture  General Electric Co.,  the world’s second-biggest maker of
wind turbines, formed a joint venture with China’s  Harbin Power
Equipment Co . to make and supply equipment in the world’s
biggest market.  The $13 billion wind market will expand sixfold to 150
gigawatts by 2020, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said
in a statement. The new venture joins GE, whose power-generation
equipment supplies a third of the world’s electricity, with
Harbin Power’s subsidiary, Harbin Electric Machinery Co.  Businesses Fear Retaliation  U.S. Legislation pressing China to raise the value of its
currency may boomerang by prompting retaliation against American
businesses operating there, representatives of those companies
said.  “This step would make it harder for us to export to China,
not easier,”  Timothy Stratford , a partner in Beijing at
Covington & Burling LLP and a former U.S. trade official, said
at a briefing in Washington.  Tyson Appeals Tariffs  Tyson Foods Inc.,  the largest U.S. chicken processor, said
it will try to appeal China’s decision to impose anti-dumping
tariffs on U.S. chicken shipments.  “We’re disappointed by the news and will continue to work
through the U.S. government and our trade associations to
reverse this decision,”  Gary Mickelson , a spokesman for
Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson, said in an e-mail. “We intend
to do everything we can to continue selling chicken profitably
to China, as well as seek ways to expand our poultry exports to
alternative markets.”  U.S. Copper Pipe Duties  The U.S. imposed dumping duties on copper pipes and tubes
from China and Mexico, acting on a complaint from Memphis,
Tennessee-based  Mueller Industries Inc.  and Cerro Flow Products
LLC in St. Louis.  The duties will be as much as 60.85 percent on $233 million
of imports from China and as much as 31.43 percent on $130
million of imports from Mexico for the products, used in
plumbing and for carrying liquids or gases in heating systems,
the Commerce Department said in an e-mailed statement.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks retreated, paring the biggest September gain

said the bank ended talks with Santander. Bank of America Corp.
