Telkom South Africa Ltd., Africa’s
largest fixed-line phone company, was rated “underperform” in
new coverage at Credit Suisse Group AG.  “We see the company’s lack of mobile exposure, well above-
average exposure to legacy fixed voice and an inflexible cost
base as major investment negatives,” analyst Richard Barker
wrote in an research note dated today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
