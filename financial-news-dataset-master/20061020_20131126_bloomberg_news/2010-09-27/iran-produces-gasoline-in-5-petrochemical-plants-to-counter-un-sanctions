Iran is producing gasoline in five
of its petrochemical plants as part of a plan to halt imports
and counter international sanctions, the state-run  Mehr  news
agency reported.  Iran is producing fuel in the petrochemical complexes of
Imam Khomeini port, Amir Kabir, Jam, Nouri and Arak, Ali-
Mohammad Bosaghzadeh, director for production control at the
National Petrochemical Co., was cited as saying by Mehr late
yesterday.  Gasoline production in its Bu Ali Sina petrochemical plant
was stopped in order to make aromatic products for domestic
demand, Bosaghzadeh said.  Iran faces international sanctions over its nuclear
program, which the U.S. and its allies accuse of being a cover
for the development of atomic weapons. Iran rejects the claim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
