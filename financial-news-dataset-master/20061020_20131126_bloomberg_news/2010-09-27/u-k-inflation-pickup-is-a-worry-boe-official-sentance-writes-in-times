U.K. consumer price increases have
become “a worry” and will persist next year because of higher
Value-Added Tax on sales, Bank of England policy maker Andrew
Sentance wrote in an opinion piece in the Times newspaper.  “Inflation is becoming a worry,” he wrote in the London-
based paper today. “With another rise in VAT coming through in
the new year, above-target inflation is likely to persist into
2011.”  The comments are his third in a week where he defended his
unsuccessful bids in the last four meetings of the Monetary
Policy Committee to raise the bank’s benchmark interest rate
from a record low of 0.5 percent. Though inflation has held
above the bank’s 2 percent target for nine months, he said price
gains aren’t likely to spiral out of control.  “There is little risk today of a return to double-digit
inflation,” he wrote. The monetary policy framework “has built
confidence that low and stable inflation will be maintained.
This confidence must not be eroded by a perception that the MPC
is becoming more tolerant of higher inflation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
