German government bonds rose as
concern deepened that European banks will need more funds and
some euro-region nations may struggle to finance their deficits,
boosting demand for the safest assets.  Bunds also advanced on speculation that fixed-income money
managers will need to add securities before the month’s end to
adjust to changes in indexes they use to measure performance.
Der Spiegel reported the European Commission lacks confidence in
the viability of German regional lenders, while Ireland will
disclose this week the cost to bail out Anglo Irish Bank Corp.
Belgian bonds outperformed benchmark German debt as the nation
sold 2.3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of securities today.  “We still have some ongoing concerns about debt in the
peripherals and this is likely to add support for core
government bonds,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior fixed-income
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris. “In the euro zone we
will have month-end index extensions, and this is providing
additional support.”  The 10-year bund yield fell 6 basis points to 2.28 percent
as of 2:24 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security maturing in
September 2020 rose 0.56, or 5.60 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 99.70.  The two-year yield slipped 1 basis point to 0.72 percent,
narrowing the  difference in yield  with 10-year securities 4
basis points to 157 basis points, the least since Aug. 31, based
on closing prices.  Record Spreads  The yield premium investors demand for Irish 10-year bonds
instead of bunds reached a record, while the yield spread also
widened for Portuguese securities.  Investors are shunning the debt of so-called peripheral
nations in favor of the safest fixed-income assets on concern
political opposition and a slower economic recovery may dent
efforts to rein in budget deficits.  Ireland’s Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  is scheduled to
publish the latest estimates on the costs associated with
bailing out Anglo Irish by Oct. 1. The European Central Bank
considered activating the euro region’s rescue fund to assist
the nation in refinancing debt, German newspaper Handelsblatt
reported, citing unidentified government officials. Standard &
Poor’s said it doesn’t expect Ireland to default on its debt.  Portugal’s government should be ready to take new measures
to cut the nation’s deficit as an increase in borrowing costs
may undermine the economic recovery, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report today.  Portuguese Spread  The 10-year Portuguese bond yield rose 2 basis points to
6.50 percent, sending the difference in yield, or spread, to
bunds to 413 basis points. It reached 420 basis points on Sept.
24. The Irish 10-year yield was 8 basis points higher at 6.70
percent, with the yield spread at a record 431 basis points.  Spain’s Finance Ministry said today the nation’s budget
deficit narrowed to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product
compared with 5.7 percent a year earlier.  The European Union is checking whether the financial help
received by German regional lenders BayernLB, WestLB AG and HSH
Nordbank AG is compatible with European law, Der Spiegel
reported on Sept. 25, citing a letter from the institution to
Germany’s deputy finance minister  Joerg Asmussen .  Belgian 10-year bonds rose, with the yield falling 11 basis
points, to 3.15 percent, narrowing the premium investors demand
to hold the securities instead of benchmark bunds 5 basis points
to 85 basis points. The nation, which has had a caretaker
government since an inconclusive election in June, auctioned
bonds maturing in 2016, 2020 and 2041. The sale drew bids for
2.55 times the amount of 2020 securities sold, compared with a
bid-to-cover ratio of 1.84 times at the previous sale.  Italy sold 3 billion euros of zero-coupon bonds due in 2012
today. The 10-year yield fell 3 basis points to 3.91 percent.
Slovakia also sold debt due in 2016 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
