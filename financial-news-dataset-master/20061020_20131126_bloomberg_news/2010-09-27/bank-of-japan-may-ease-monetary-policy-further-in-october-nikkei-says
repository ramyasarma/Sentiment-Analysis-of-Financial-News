The Bank of Japan may discuss more
steps to ease monetary policy at its Oct. 4-Oct.5 policy board
meeting, Nikkei English News reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  Japan’s central bank wants to prevent a weakening economy
in the face of a stronger yen, and is concerned that personal
spending and production could be worse than its forecasts when
government subsidies expire, Nikkei reported. The bank may add
longer-term funds into the money market to tamp down interest
rates for corporations and individuals, Nikkei reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
