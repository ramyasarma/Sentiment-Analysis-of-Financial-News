U.S. stocks fell, trimming gains in
the best September for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since
1939, and the euro slumped as yield spreads for Irish and
Portuguese debt jumped to record closing levels. Treasuries
gained after a $36 billion auction of two-year notes.  The S&P 500 Index fell 0.6 percent to 1,142.16 at 4 p.m. in
New York, after gaining 2.1 percent last week. Yields for two-
year Treasuries fell 0.02 percentage point to 0.42 percent, near
the record low of 0.41 percent, while the payout on 10-year
notes slipped 10 basis points to 2.51 percent. The euro
depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.3471. The extra yield investors
demand to own 10-year bonds issued by Ireland and Portugal
climbed to 6.57 percent and 6.42 percent, respectively, compared
with 2.27 percent for Germany debt expiring at the same time.  Treasuries gained after the auction of two-year securities
drew the most demand since August 2007 amid speculation the
Federal Reserve will buy government debt to help sustain the
economic recovery. Anglo Irish Bank Corp.’s credit was
downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service, spurring concern that
the European debt crisis is worsening.  “Continued issues on the global banking front are sending
chills down the market’s spine,” said  Chad Morganlander , a
Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus
& Co., which oversees $90 billion. “Overall concern about
sustainable growth without fiscal stimulus will be the key
driver in coming months as we digest the best September in U.S.
equity markets since the ‘30s.”  Inflation-Indexed Debt  The Fed will buy inflation-index debt tomorrow maturing
from January 2011 to February 2040 as part of its program to
reinvest principal payments from its mortgage holdings. The Fed
said Sept. 21 that it’s prepared to provide “additional
accommodation” to support the economy.  A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate-credit risk rose
for the fourth time in five trading days.  Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
increased 0.7 basis point to a mid-price of 109.31 basis points
in New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The benchmark, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates, began a new series Sept. 20 at 108.4 basis points.  European, Emerging Markets  The  Stoxx Europe 600  Index fell 0.4 percent. Actelion Ltd.,
the largest Swiss biotechnology company, sank 8 percent after
its treatment for bleeding in the brain didn’t meet the main
goal of a study. Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world’s largest
maker of wind turbines, dropped 3.8 percent as Financial Times
Deutschland reported that Germany scrapped provisions for
funding energy programs. Unilever advanced 1.3 percent after
agreeing to buy Alberto-Culver Co. for $3.7 billion in cash.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  rallied 0.8 percent and was
poised to close at the highest level since July 2008. Turkey’s
ISE National 100 Index gained 0.6 percent in Istanbul, extending
a record. China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  advanced 1.4 percent,
the most in three weeks, after a report showed industrial
profits jumped 55 percent during the first eight months of 2010.
Benchmark equity gauges in the  Philippines  and Indonesia
increased to records, while Thailand’s  SET Index  jumped to the
highest level since 1996.  Venezuela’s bonds posted the biggest gain in emerging
markets after opposition candidates secured 52 percent of the
vote in a legislative vote yesterday, handing President  Hugo Chavez  his worst setback at the ballot box since taking office
in 1999, losing his two-thirds majority in congress.  Venezuelan Spreads  The extra yield investors demand to own Venezuelan bonds
instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 11.52 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co.’s EMBI+ index. The broader EMBI+ index rose 1 basis point
to 2.84 percent.  Cotton for December delivery jumped 4 cents, the most
allowed by ICE Futures U.S., to $1.0393 a pound, a 15-year high. 
Sugar climbed to a seven-month high on concern adverse weather
will curb output in Brazil, the world’s biggest exporter, and
Australia, the third-largest.  Refined-sugar futures for December delivery rose $11, or
1.7 percent, to close at $644.10 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in
London. The price reached $648.30, the highest level since March
