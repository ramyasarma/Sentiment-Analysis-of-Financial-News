France’s  CAC 40 Index  dropped
16.32, or 0.4 percent, to 3,766.16 at the 5:30 p.m. close in
Paris. The SBF 120 Index declined 0.4 percent to 2,798.51.  The following shares are among the most active in the
French equity market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses

of 26.92 euros. Europe’s largest hotel company was upgraded to
“outperform” from “neutral” at Credit Suisse Group AG, which
increased profit estimates for the European hotel industry for
2011.  Carrefour SA  (CA FP) dropped 2.7 percent to 40.17 euros,
the worst performer in the CAC 40 today. Shares in the world’s
second-largest retailer were cut to “neutral” from “buy” at
BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. The stock was also raised to
“buy” from “hold” at ING Groep NV.  Latecoere SA  (LAT FP) surged 15 percent to 7.15 euros, the
biggest jump in more than a year. More shares exchanged hands
than at any time since 2003. Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc.,
the airplane component maker spun off from Boeing Co. in 2005,
may bid for Toulouse, France-based Latecoere, Le Figaro said.
Officials from Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit will meet Latecoere
Chairman Pierre Gadonneix to discuss an offer, the French daily
newspaper reported, without giving a date for the meeting or
citing anybody.       Pernod Ricard SA  (RI FP) rose 1.9 percent to 60.45 euros, a
third advance. The liquor company increased its summer sales by
7 percent compared with 2008, La Lettre de L’Expansion reported,
without citing anyone. The company benefited from a recovery in
demand at its cafes, hotels and restaurants, according to the
weekly newsletter, which didn’t define the dates of the summer
period.  Soitec SA  (SOI FP) rose 5.1 percent to 7.31 euros, capping
four days of losses. The supplier to the chip industry said that
its second-quarter sales will be close to stable excluding
currency movements. In a statement on its Web site, the company
said that it will offset a 2 percent drop in total wafer sales
with revenue from other activities. Soitec repeated its target
for first-half sequential sales growth of about 20 percent.       Sanofi-Aventis SA  (SAN FP) fell 1.2 percent to 50.01 euros.
The drugmaker is considering raising its bid for Genzyme Corp.
and is arranging more financing, the Wall Street Journal

Sanofi wants to enter “constructive discussion” with Genzyme
about a $69-a-share offer buy the U.S. company, a spokesman for
