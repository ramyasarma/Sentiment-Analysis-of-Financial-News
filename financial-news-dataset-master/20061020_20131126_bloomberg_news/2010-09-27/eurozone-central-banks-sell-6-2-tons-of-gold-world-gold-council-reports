Central banks and the International
Monetary Fund sold about 94.5 metric tons of gold in the year
that ended yesterday, the lowest amount under an agreement that
began in 1999, according to data from the World Gold Council.  Eurozone banks disposed of 6.2 tons, led by Germany, Greece
and Malta, while the International Monetary Fund sold 88.3 tons.
The figure for the eurozone banks was 96 percent below last
year’s 142 tons. The data run through Sept. 14 and the first
year of the third five-year agreement ended yesterday.  Gold is heading for a 10th consecutive annual advance, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920, spurring central
banks globally to add the metal to reserves. Combined central
bank holdings rose in every quarter since the second quarter of
last year, data from the council show.  The Central Bank Gold Agreement was announced more than a
decade ago because of concern that uncoordinated selling was
destabilizing the gold market and driving down prices. Gold fell
from a then-record $850 an ounce in 1980 to $253.83 in February
2001. It reached a record $1,300.07 on Sept. 24.  Signatories to the latest accord are limited to combined
annual sales of 400 tons, down from 500 tons in the previous
agreement. Sales under the previous agreement had dwindled to
157 tons by its final year, ending in 2009. Sales by eurozone
banks have declined every year since 2006.  The IMF said in September 2009 it would put 403.3 tons of
bullion up for sale as part of a plan to shore up its finances
and lend at reduced rates to low-income countries.  Members of the current  accord  are: the European Central
Bank, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Sweden,
Switzerland, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta and Slovakia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
