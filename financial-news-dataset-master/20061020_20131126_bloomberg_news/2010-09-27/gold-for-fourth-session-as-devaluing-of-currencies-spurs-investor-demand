Gold rose for a fourth straight
session in New York on speculation that slumping currencies will
boost demand for precious metals as alternative investments.
Silver extended gains to the highest price since 1980.  The euro fell from a five-month high against the dollar
amid renewed concern that some European banks lack adequate
capital. The greenback dropped 2.5 percent last week against a
basket of major currencies. In the past year, central banks and
the International Monetary Fund sold the least amount of gold
since an agreement to limit sales began in 1999, the World Gold
Council estimates.  “There is a net devaluing of currencies,” said  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London. “Asian
central banks are taking up the metal, and that’s certainly
buoyed investor sentiment.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained 50 cents to
settle at $1,298.60 an ounce at 1:55 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal reached a record $1,301.60 on Sept. 24. Prices
have rallied 18 percent this year, heading for a 10th straight
annual increase.  Gold for immediate delivery in London climbed to an all-
time high of $1,300.15 today.  The price may advance to $1,406 in a year, the London
Bullion Market Association said today, according to the average
of estimates in a survey of participants at the group’s
conference in Berlin.  Relative-Strength Index  The rally may be limited after futures climbed 4.1 percent
in the past two weeks, analysts said. The 14-day relative
strength index for gold futures has been above 70 for four
straight sessions, a signal to some traders that the price may
decline.  A drop to $1,210 “in the coming days and weeks” will do
“absolutely nothing to the long-term bull market’s validity,”
said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  The dollar fluctuated against a basket of six major
currencies, gaining as much as 0.2 percent and dropping as much
as 0.3 percent.  “There’s not a lot of reasons to buy gold at the moment,”
said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.
“The dollar is flat, so gold is missing the dollar influence.”  Central-bank sales of gold decreased to 94.5 metric tons in
the year ended yesterday from 157 tons in the prior period,
according to figures on the World Gold Council’s website.
European central banks have agreed to limit sales since 1999.
India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh bought bullion from the IMF in
the past year.  Spot gold is heading for the 10th straight annual advance,
the longest rally since at least 1920, spurring central banks
globally to add the metal to reserves.  Silver, Platinum  Silver futures for December delivery rose 7.2 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $21.471 an ounce on the Comex, after rising to
$21.645, the highest price for a most-active contract since
October 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $10.40, or 0.6
percent, to $1,635 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery dropped $8.30, or
1.5 percent, to $552.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
