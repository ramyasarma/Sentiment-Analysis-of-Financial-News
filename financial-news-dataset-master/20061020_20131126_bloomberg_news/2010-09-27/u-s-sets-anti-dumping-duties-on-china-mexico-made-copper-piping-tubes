The U.S. imposed dumping duties on
copper pipes and tubes from China and Mexico, acting on a
complaint from Memphis, Tennessee-based  Mueller Industries Inc. 
and Cerro Flow Products LLC in St. Louis.  The duties will be as much as 60.85 percent on $233 million
of imports from China and as much as 31.43 percent on $130
million of imports from Mexico for the products, used in
plumbing and for carrying liquids or gases in heating systems,
the Commerce Department said in an e-mailed statement.  Zhejiang Hailiang Co ., China’s largest publicly traded
copper-tube maker, had its duties raised to 60.85 percent from
58.69 percent. Golden Dragon Precise Copper Tube Group Inc.
faces an 11.25 percent duty, and other major Chinese makers will
pay an additional 36.05 percent, according to the statement.  IUSA SA, a Mexican tube and pipe producer, had its
preliminary duty lowered to 24.89 percent, while the average
rate on Mexican imports will be 28.16 percent.  The decision, announced today by the Commerce Department,
is the third of four needed to make the tariffs final. Chinese
and Mexican copper tube makers will have to deposit duties for
products shipped to the U.S. while the case is pending. The
final ruling is scheduled for Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
