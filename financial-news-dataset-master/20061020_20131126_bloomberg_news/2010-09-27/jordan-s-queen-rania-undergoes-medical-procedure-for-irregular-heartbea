Jordan’s  Queen Rania  underwent a
medical procedure in New York to correct an irregular heart
rhythm and is recovering, the  Royal Court  said in an e-mailed
statement.  “The procedure went very smoothly and Her Majesty is well
and in good spirits,” according to the statement. “She will
remain in hospital for two nights while she recuperates.”  Rania, who was accompanying her husband  King Abdullah  in
New York this past week to attend the United Nations General
Assembly, is scheduled to return to Jordan later this week, the
court said.  The procedure which Queen Rania underwent is a
catheterization through a vein to the heart, used to treat
abnormal heart rhythms or premature ventricular contractions,
according to the Royal Court. During the procedure, an electric
current is used to stop the disturbance of electrical flow
through the heart, thus restoring a healthy heart rhythm.  Queen Rania, 40, has four children with the Jordanian
monarch: Prince Hussein, who is the crown prince, Princess Iman,
Princess Salma and Prince Hashem.  To contact the reporter on this story:
