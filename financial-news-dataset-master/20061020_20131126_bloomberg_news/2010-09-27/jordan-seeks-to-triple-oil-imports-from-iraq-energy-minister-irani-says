Jordan is seeking to triple oil
imports from neighboring Iraq to help meet domestic demand, the
Jordanian energy minister said.  Jordan, which imports almost all of its energy needs, has
asked Iraq to increase supplies of crude transported by truck to
30,000 barrels a day from the current level of 10,000 barrels a
day,  Khalid Irani  said in a telephone interview from Amman.  “This is within the terms of the agreement that we already
have between Jordan and Iraq,” the minister said yesterday. “We
are awaiting their response.”  Jordan, which imports about 90,000 barrels of oil a day,
forecasts its fuel consumption to increase to 10 million metric
tons of oil equivalent by 2020, up from 7.5 million tons today.
The Middle Eastern country projects its electricity consumption
to almost double in the next 10 years to 5,200 megawatts.  Jordan also wants to increase imports of natural gas, build
a nuclear plant and develop its own oil shale and renewable
energy projects.  Jordan has the world’s fourth-largest reserves of oil shale
and has signed accords with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  and Estonia’s
Eesti Energia AS for the extraction of shale oil to feed power
plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
