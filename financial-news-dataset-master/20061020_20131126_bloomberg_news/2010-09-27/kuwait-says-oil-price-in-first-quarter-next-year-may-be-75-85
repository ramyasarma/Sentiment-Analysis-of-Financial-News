Kuwait doesn’t expect OPEC to
change its production quotas at its meeting next month, Oil
Minister Sheikh  Ahmad al-Abdullah al-Sabah  said today.  “No, I don’t expect it to change,” al-Sabah said in
response to questions from reporters in New Delhi. The 12-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is next scheduled
to meet on Oct. 14 in Vienna.  OPEC in a report this month trimmed the outlook for demand
for its members’ crude in 2011 as output from outside the group
increases. Al-Sabah said he expects the price of oil in the
first quarter of next year to range from $75 to $85 a barrel.  Crude oil for October delivery rose 30 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $76.79 a barrel at 08:32 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Prices are down 3.3 percent this year.  Compliance among the 11 members subject to quotas is about
52 percent, Al-Sabah said.  “OPEC should be more committed to their quotas,” he said.
“There are little bits of slippages here and there.”  The group announced a record production cut in December
2008 as global demand collapsed. Adherence to the reduction of
4.2 million barrels a day, capping output at 24.845 million,
slipped as prices rebounded 78 percent last year.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
