Apple Inc. , which sold more than 3
million iPads in the first 80 days after the tablet’s debut, may
introduce a new version in the second quarter of 2011, according
to analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.   The new iPad with a 9.7 inch display may be thinner and
lighter, with a built-in camera and mini USB port, analysts
Henry King in Hong Kong and Kevin Lu in Taipei said in
yesterday’s report.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. , the world’s
largest contract maker of electronics, will likely be the
supplier, they wrote.  The iPad touchscreen computer has become one of the
Cupertino, California-based company’s top-selling products in
its first year on the market. The tablet faces competition from
similar products by Hewlett-Packard Co., Samsung Electronics Co.
and Research In Motion Ltd., which unveiled a 7-inch device
yesterday.  Sales of such tablet computers could reach 16 million units
this year and 35 million in 2011, according to Goldman Sachs.  The creation of a smaller 7-inch version of the iPad hasn’t
been finalized, the analysts said.  Natalie Kerris , a spokeswoman
for Apple, declined to comment.  Apple  fell $4.30, or 1.5 percent, to $286.86 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading at 4:30 p.m. New York time. The shares have
risen 36 percent this year.  Last quarter, iPads accounted for $2.17 billion, or 12
percent, of Apple’s overall sales, more than the nine-year-old
iPod. The iPad went on sale in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
