Billionaire  Warren Buffett  affirmed
his support for  BYD Co ., saying the Chinese automaker part-owned
by his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  will be a leader in electric cars.  “BYD is a young and promising company experiencing
dynamic growth,” Buffett said yesterday during his first visit
to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, where the manufacturer
is based. “BYD will play a leading role in the future.”  The company’s stock rose as much as 3.6 percent to
HK$59.70 today after Buffett’s comments and traded at HK$58.30
as of 11:26 a.m. on the Hong Kong exchange. The benchmark Hang
Seng Index was little changed.  Buffett’s visit comes after BYD’s sales dropped 19 percent
in August and the company has said it may fail to meet a
schedule for delivering electric cars to California. BYD, which
was China’s fastest growing automaker last year, said yesterday
it has signed 30 dealers to market the F3DM plug-in hybrid in 20
Chinese cities.  “The presence of Warren Buffett should help the company to
regain a bit of confidence,” said  Klaus Paur , a Shanghai-based
auto market consultant for TNS Research International in a
Bloomberg Television interview today. “BYD has lost a bit of
its momentum, the market is disappointed simply because it is
not delivering on the promises it has made.”  Challenges Ahead  The carmaker still faces challenges ahead as it tries to
address falling sales, Paur said. Shenzhen-based BYD slashed its
2010 sales outlook by 25 percent to 600,000 vehicles from
800,000 on Aug. 4, while its shares had declined 19 percent  this
year  before Buffett’s visit.  BYD , founded as a battery maker by China’s richest man,
 Wang Chuanfu , entered the automobile market in 2003 and began
mass production of the world’s first plug-in hybrid five years
later. The carmaker plans to start selling the E6 electric car
in the U.S. this year and in Europe next year.  Buffett, speaking to BYD dealers in a crowded hall in
Shenzhen, said he was impressed with the E6 after test-driving
it in May. Berkshire Hathaway owns 10 percent of the automaker
through MidAmerican Energy Holdings, based in Des Moines, Iowa.  E6 Electric Car  The E6 will take six hours for a full charge and will run
for more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) per charge in cruising
mode, BYD said yesterday. This is a drop from the 400 kilometer
range the automaker  announced at the Detroit auto show  in
January 2009.  BYD is adding electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as
rivals such as  General Motors Co.  and  Nissan Motor Co . plan to
introduce battery-powered models in China. The country, the
world’s biggest polluter, is offering buyer incentives for fuel-
efficient vehicles to help cut emissions.  The government said in June it would offer as much as
50,000 yuan ($7,471) toward the purchase of plug-in hybrid
models and up to 60,000 yuan for vehicles that run only on
batteries in five Chinese cities on a trial basis. China may
subsidize purchases of at least 4 million energy-efficient
vehicles by 2012, the National Development and Reform Commission,
China’s top economic planner, said in June.  The dealer arrangement announced yesterday for the F3DM
hybrid extends sales beyond Shenzhen, the only place the car is
available now. It will retail for 119,800 yuan after the
government subsidy.  Hybrid Sales  The automaker delivered 48 F3DM cars in 2009 at 149,800
yuan apiece. In the first nine months of the year, it has sold
183,629 of China’s best-selling car, the gasoline-powered F3,
which costs an average of 70,000 yuan. BYD declined to give F3DM
sales numbers for 2010.  BYD also announced plans yesterday to build an energy
storage factory with China Southern Power Grid Co. to expand
into what BYD calls its “new energy” business. BYD signed a
cooperation agreement with Spain’s Endesa SA on Sept. 25 that
includes testing small and large-scale battery storage systems.  -- Liza Lin  in Shenzhen, with assistance from  Henry Sanderson ,
