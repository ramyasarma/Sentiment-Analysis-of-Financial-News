Gold futures were little changed as
some investors sold bullion after prices rallied above $1,300 an
ounce, near last week’s record high.  Gold has jumped 3.8 percent this month, before today,
touching an all-time high of $1,301.60 on Sept. 24, as the
dollar plunged 4.6 percent against a basket of six major
currencies. The greenback fluctuated today, dropping as much as
0.3 percent and gaining 0.2 percent.  “There’s not a lot of reasons to buy gold at the moment,”
said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.
“The dollar is flat, so gold is missing the dollar influence.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 40 cents to
$1,297.70 an ounce at 11:36 a.m. the Comex in New York. Prices
have risen in seven of the past eight weeks and are up 18
percent this year, heading for a 10th straight annual gain.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 2.6 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $21.425 an ounce on the Comex, after rising to
$21.645, the highest price for a most-active contract since
October 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $9.60, or 0.6
percent, to $1,635.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery dropped $4.05, or
0.7 percent, to $556.45 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
