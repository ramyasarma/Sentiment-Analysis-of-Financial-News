Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH’s
insolvency plan, due to be finalized this week, may be
imperiled by objections filed by two creditors, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing unidentified people at the
company.  Gilde Group, which seeks payment of a 71,000 euros
($95,560) claim, and Dawnay Day, which seeks several million
euros, would need to retract their objections to clear the way
for investor Nicolas Berggruen to take over the operations as
planned on Sept. 30, the newspaper said.  Legal proceedings over the objections, including appeals,
would drag on for months, so only a settlement could prevent an
impasse, according to FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
