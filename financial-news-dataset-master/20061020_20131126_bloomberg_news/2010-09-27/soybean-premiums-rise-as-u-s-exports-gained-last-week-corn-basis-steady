Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
to export terminals near New Orleans increased relative to
Chicago futures as U.S. export shipments jumped last week to the
highest level in six months. Corn premiums were steady.  The spot-basis  bid,  or premium, for soybeans delivered in
September was 52 cents to 58 cents a bushel above November
futures yesterday, compared with 52 cents to 57 cents on Sept.
24, government data show. The average  spot-export bid  was
$11.835 a bushel, the highest level in almost 13 months. Corn
premiums were unchanged at 35 cents to 38 cents above December
futures.  “Demand continues to be good for soybeans, with Chinese
pricing for U.S. supplies,” said  Troy Lust , a commercial grain
consultant at FCStone LLC in West Des Moines, Iowa. “The
pipeline supply of corn is starting to fill as Midwest
harvesting is starting to increase.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2.5 cents, or
0.2 percent, to close yesterday at $11.285 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after touching $11.44, the highest price
since June 2009. The oilseed gained 5.3 percent last week, the
most in 10 months.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 9 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle yesterday at $5.1275 a bushel on the CBOT,
the biggest decline since Aug. 24. Earlier, the price touched
$5.2875, the highest price for a most-active contract since
September 2008.  Government inspectors  examined more than twice the amount
of soybeans for export in the week ended Sept. 23 than a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Of
the shipments, 45 percent were headed to China, the world’s
largest consumer.  Corn inspected  for export fell to 34.003 million bushels
last week from 35.669 million a year earlier, USDA data show.
Shipments from Sept. 1 to Sept. 23 are down 11 percent to 129.24
million bushels from the same period a year earlier, according
to the department.  “We are at price levels that are slowing demand for corn”
from both overseas buyers and domestic users, including makers
of animal feed and ethanol, Lust said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
