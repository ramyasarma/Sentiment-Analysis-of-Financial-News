The Federal Reserve is considering
using a smaller-scale, open-ended method of Treasury purchases
to bolster the U.S. recovery, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The proposal would contrast with large-scale plans with a
determined ending and give the central bank more flexibility to
deal with the course of the recovery, the newspaper said,
without naming a source. Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  is a proponent of a smaller plan, as a more
comprehensive one may destabilize markets or fuel inflation, the
Journal cited him as saying.  The Fed said in August it would use principal payments from
its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities and agency
debt to buy Treasuries. The central bank announced on Sept. 21
it was prepared to do more to help the economy and to keep costs
from falling, adding to speculation policy makers are
contemplating adding securities to the Fed’s holdings, a
strategy known as quantitative easing.  The central bank bought $300 billion of Treasuries in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
