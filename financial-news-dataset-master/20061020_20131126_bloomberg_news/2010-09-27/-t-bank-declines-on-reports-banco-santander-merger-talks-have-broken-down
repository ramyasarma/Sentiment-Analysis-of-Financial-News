M&T Bank Corp.  posted its biggest
one-day loss in 16 months in New York trading after reports that
merger talks with Banco Santander SA have broken down again.  The talks between M&T, based in Buffalo, New York, and
Santander, based in the Spanish city of the same name, fell
apart late last week over a disagreement about who would control
the combination of Santander’s Sovereign Bank unit and M&T, a
person with knowledge of the matter said.  M&T  fell  7 percent to $84.24 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the biggest skid since May 13, 2009.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 25 that the talks had
stalled.  Santander has been pursuing a merger of Sovereign with M&T,
while negotiating for  Allied Irish Banks Plc ’s 22.5 percent
stake in the lender, other people with knowledge of the matter
have said. Together, M&T and Sovereign, which are about the same
size, would become the ninth-largest U.S. savings institution by
deposits.  Talks between Santander and M&T, led by Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Wilmers , 76, stopped earlier this year and later
restarted. Under a proposal recently discussed with the U.S.
Federal Reserve, Santander would eventually acquire a majority
stake in M&T while leaving Wilmers and his management team with
some elements of control, the people said.  M&T Bank could be an attractive takeover target for
Pittsburgh-based  PNC Financial Services Group , according to an
August report by  David Hendler , senior analyst at CreditSights
Inc., in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
