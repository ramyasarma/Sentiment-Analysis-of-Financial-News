Nigeria’s constitution and
electoral law will be amended in order to accommodate a request
by the  Independent National Electoral Commission  to delay
elections planned for January, a parliament official said.  Lawmakers who met with the commission today demanded new
election dates before agreeing to consider an extension,  Ike Ekweremadu , deputy president of the Senate, told reporters in
the capital,  Abuja . Once the new dates are received, the body
will “start the process of legislating on those extensions,”
he said.  A time table released by the electoral body on Sept. 7
scheduled general elections between Jan. 15 and Jan. 29, with
new-voter registration due before then. About two weeks later,
the agency said it needed an extra two months to organize the
polls. The initial schedule was released to comply with
constitutional requirements that voting be held at least 120
days before the end of the current administration’s tenure on
May 29, it said.  Elections held in Nigeria in 2007 were condemned by local
and international monitors as being marred by fraud, including
ballot-snatching, falsification of figures and violent
intimidation of opponents. Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil
producer and the fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports.  President  Goodluck Jonathan , who declared his candidacy on
Sept. 18, has pledged to deliver credible election results in
Africa’s most populous country of more than 140 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
