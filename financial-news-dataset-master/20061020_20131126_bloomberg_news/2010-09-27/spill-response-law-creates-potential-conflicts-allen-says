Putting the company responsible for
an oil spill in charge of the cleanup creates a potential
conflict of interest, the U.S. official who led the response to
the  BP Plc  spill told an investigating panel.  Policy makers should consider giving an independent expert
control of spill-response resources, National Incident Commander
 Thad Allen  said today at a Washington hearing.  “We need to really think about what we mean by the concept
of responsible party and how we want that to work in the
future,” Allen told the  National Commission  on the BP Deepwater
Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. “Something we might
want to consider is the creation of a qualified individual that
would represent the industry, oversee the response, have access
to the resources.”  BP had responsibility under U.S. law to lead cleanup
efforts after its Macondo well, about 40 miles (64 kilometers)
off the Louisiana coast, blew out April 20. The explosion killed
11 workers and set off an uncontrolled leak that spewed 4.9
million gallons until BP plugged the well in mid July.  There is no indication BP was slow to deploy resources
because of concern about costs, Allen said. Any delays were more
likely the result of “the enormity” of the response, he said.  “The notion of supply of boom and skimmers and so forth
was not an issue of funding,” Allen said. “Between BP and the
United States government, there was enough money. It was
actually producing it, shipping it and get it where it needed to
be, once the resource requirements exceeded those in the plans”
at the time, he said.  Louisiana Complaints  Louisiana officials such as U.S. Senator  Mary Landrieu , a
Democrat, and Republican Governor  Bobby Jindal , criticized BP’s
response to the worst U.S. oil spill. Representative  Ed Markey ,
a Massachusetts Democrat, challenged BP’s initial estimate of
oil gushing from the well, which were far below the actual rate.  “No one had a plan,” said William Nungesser, president of
Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, told the panel. “The sense of
urgency has to be on the ground with someone in charge, fully in
charge here, not in Washington.”  Efforts to prevent oil from reaching the Gulf Coast shore
and marshes were hampered by delays in decision-making among BP,
federal and local officials, Allen said. The government added
people with authority to make decisions “closer to where the
oil was,” Allen said.  The spill prompted President  Barack Obama ’s administration
to halt drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet. The moratorium,
which idled 33 rigs, is scheduled to end Nov. 30.  Salazar, Bromwich  Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  and  Michael Bromwich , head
of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that oversees offshore
drilling, have said the ban may be lifted early if companies
show improved safety and was to contain oil spills.  The moratorium is costing the region from 8,000 to 12,000
jobs, according to an administration report, fewer than earlier
estimates and less than predictions by groups such as Baton
Rouge-based Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association,
which said the ban may cost as many as 46,000 rig jobs.  A report prepared for the commission in August by the
Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based research group,
said the suspension is no longer needed because new rules reduce
the risk of an uncontrolled spill.  “I’ll be amazed if the moratorium is not lifted before
Nov. 30,” said  William Reilly , the former Environmental
Protection Agency administrator and co-chairman of the
commission with  Bob Graham , former Democratic senator from
Florida. “The kinds of questions that I have asked, Senator
Graham has asked, we continue not to understand the answers and
why it’s taking so long to clear 33 rigs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
