Affinion Group Holdings Inc. , the
provider of marketing and customer-loyalty plans, intends to
issue debt as a measure of cash availability at speculative-
grade companies gained by the second-most on record in August.  Affinion will sell about $325 million of senior notes due
in 2015, the Stamford, Connecticut-based company said in a Sept.
22 statement distributed by PR Newswire. Proceeds may be used to
repay a senior unsecured term loan facility and for general
corporate purposes, the company said.  Sales of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds are surging
as investors gain confidence the economy won’t tumble back into
recession and yields on speculative bonds hover near the lowest
in more than three years.  “By issuing bonds, companies have been able to term out
future maturities and pay down bank facilities,” Moody’s
analyst  John Puchalla  said in a telephone interview. “Trends
are becoming more favorable and there’s been gradual improvement
in liquidity. Our base case expectation is that this will
continue.”  Junk bond sales last week fell to $11.4 billion from $14.2
billion the previous week. Companies have sold a record $188.9
billion of speculative-grade debt in the U.S. this year,
compared with the previous record of $162.7 billion last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Liquidity Ratings  Upgrades of Moody’s Investors Service’s Speculative-Grade
Liquidity ratings outnumbered downgrades by 18 to 5 in August,
the ratings company said in a Sept. 22 report. The upgrades were
the most since 25 in April, which was the record since the
measure was introduced in 2002.  “These upgrades were driven primarily by new and proposed
debt issuance, amendments to credit facilities, and cash flow,
which is improving notwithstanding economic hurdles,” Puchalla
wrote in the report.  The extra yield investors demand to own high-yield
corporate debt instead of Treasuries fell 5 basis points on
Sept. 24 to 632 basis points, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index, leaving the gain
for the week at 8 basis points. They touched a high of 1,886 in
March 2009 amid the recession that ran from December 2007 to
June 2009, the longest since World War II.  Absolute yields on the debt fell 2 basis points to 8.134
percent, down 5 basis points for the week. The index touched its
lowest since 2007 on Sept. 21, when it was 8.132 percent.  High-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB- by S&P. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  High-Yield Sales  GenOn Energy sold $1.23 billion of eight- and 10-year notes
and
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International issued $1.2 billion of
debt due in 2017 and 2020 to lead high-yield issuance last week.  Investment-grade spreads were unchanged for the third
straight day and for the week at 184 basis points, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index.
Yields on the debt rose 3 basis points to 3.76 percent, bringing
the change for the week to a drop of 9 basis points. The index
reached a record low of 3.72 percent on Sept. 22.  Microsoft Corp. sold $4.75 billion of bonds on Sept. 22 in
