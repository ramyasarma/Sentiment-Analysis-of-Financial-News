Kazakhstan will “temporarily” ban
the export of oilseeds and buckwheat after drought led to
increases in domestic prices, the government said.  Buckwheat prices surged by as much as 49 percent, Economic
Development and Trade Minister Zhanar Aitzhanova told a Cabinet
meeting in the capital, Astana, today, according to the e-mailed
copy of her speech.  The ministry also plans to impose export duties on
oilseeds, sunflower seeds, rapeseed and soybeans, she said.
Aitzhanova didn’t give a timeframe for the planned changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
