Connecticut Attorney General
 Richard Blumenthal  said his office is investigating defective
foreclosure documents filed by  GMAC/Ally Finance Inc.  and
demanding that the company freeze foreclosures in the state.  “The GMAC/Ally foreclosure steamroller should be stopped
so the company can be held accountable,” Blumenthal said today
in a statement. “My office has already confirmed that some
defective documents were filed in Connecticut.”  Blumenthal’s action follows news of investigations by
Texas, Iowa and Illinois into mortgage practices at Ally.
California ordered the company to stop foreclosures until it can
prove it is complying with state law.  Ally, the Detroit-based auto and home lender, faces claims
that its GMAC unit evicted people from their homes without first
ensuring the borrowers were in default or the firm had legal
standing to take possession of the homes.  GMAC Mortgage on Sept. 17 notified agents and brokers that
it was suspending evictions in 23 states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
