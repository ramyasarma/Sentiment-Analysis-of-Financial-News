Shawcross in the January transfer window after allowing nine
goals in its first five Serie A games, the  Daily Mirror  said.  Stoke has made it clear it won’t trade the 22-year-old
Shawcross, who has twice been picked for England squads by
national team coach  Fabio Capello , the Mirror said.  Rooney’s Woes  Former England coach  Kevin Keegan  said  Wayne Rooney ’s
confidence is “shot” after seeing him substituted in a 2-2
draw at Bolton yesterday,  the Sun  reported.  Keegan also said Rooney can’t complain about media
attention on his private life because he sold pictures of his
wedding to a magazine, the Sun said.  Green Charge  West Ham goalkeeper  Robert Green  faces a misconduct charge
after making an insulting gesture after the Hammers beat
Tottenham at the weekend,  the Sun  reported.  Green, criticized for his World Cup gaffe against the U.S.,
gave a “defiant salute” to his critics, the Sun said.  Tottenham Double  William Gallas  and Ledley King were injured in the same
training session last week, further depleting Tottenham’s
defense ahead of its Champions League game against Twente, the

muscle, the Mail said. It’s unclear how long King, who has a
groin injury, will be out of action, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
