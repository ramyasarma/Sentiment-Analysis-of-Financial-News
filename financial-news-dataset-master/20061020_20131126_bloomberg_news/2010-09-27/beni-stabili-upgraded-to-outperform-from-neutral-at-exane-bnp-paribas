Beni Stabili SpA , the Italian real
estate company controlled by France’s Fonciere des Regions SA,
was upgraded to “outperform” from “neutral” at Exane BNP
Paribas, which cited the stock among “restructuring stories”
in the industry.  The brokerage also said that “Beni Stabili’s share price
does not factor in the upside from the tax benefits of the
adoption of SIIQ status,” according to a note dated Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
