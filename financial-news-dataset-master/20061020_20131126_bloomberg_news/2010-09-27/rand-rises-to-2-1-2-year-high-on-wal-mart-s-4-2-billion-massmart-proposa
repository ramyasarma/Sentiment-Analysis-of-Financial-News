The rand rallied to its strongest
level in more than 2 1/2 years against the dollar as gold traded
near a record and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  offered to pay as much as
$4.2 billion for Johannesburg-based  Massmart Holdings Ltd.   South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 0.8 percent
to 6.9648 per dollar, the strongest since January 2008, and
traded at 7.0075 by 4:39 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous
close of 7.0190. Against the euro, the rand gained 0.3 percent
to 9.4429, snapping four days of losses.  Massmart, South Africa’s biggest food and general goods
wholesaler, received a non-binding proposal from Wal-Mart which
may lead to a cash offer of 148 rand ($21.09) a share, the
Johannesburg-based retailer said today. That’s 9.8 percent
higher than its closing price on Sept. 23, the last day the
shares traded.  “It’s definitely a positive to have the prospect of more
than $4 billion rand flowing into the country,” said  Brigid Taylor , a senior currency analyst at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg. “That certainly helps the rand.”  Wal-Mart’s proposed acquisition of Massmart adds to likely
investment inflows into South Africa that include HSBC Holdings
Plc’s proposed buyout of  Nedbank Group Ltd.  and Nippon Telegraph
& Telephone Corp.’s purchase of  Dimension Data Plc . HSBC is in
talks to buy as much as 70 percent of Johannesburg-based
Nedbank, valued at 75 billion rand while NTT has support from
almost 80 percent of Dimension Data shareholders for its $3.2
billion buyout plan.  The rand also strengthened as the price of gold, which
along with platinum accounts for about a fifth of South Africa’s
exports, advanced as much as 0.3 percent to $1,300.15 per ounce.  Government bonds rose, with the benchmark 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 climbing 6 cents to 125.98 rand. The
yield on the bond decreased 2 basis points to 7.18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
