China’s yuan rose to the strongest
level since 1993 on speculation the government will allow faster
appreciation as the U.S. steps up pressure for the currency to
trade more freely.  The currency climbed for a 10th day, appreciating even
after the  People’s Bank of China  set a weaker reference rate for
the first time since Sept. 8. American lawmakers will vote in
two days on legislation that would let American companies
petition for higher duties on imports from China to compensate
for the effect of a weak currency.  “Given the increasing foreign pressure and the bright
outlook for the Chinese economy, the yuan’s appreciation trend
won’t change,” said  Lu Ting , a Hong Kong-based economist at
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.  The yuan rose 0.2 percent to close at 6.6923 per dollar in
Shanghai, from 6.7079 on Sept. 21, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trading System. It earlier touched 6.6859, the
strongest level since the central bank unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The monetary authority set the yuan’s reference rate at
6.7098 per dollar, compared with 6.6997 on Sept. 21. Local
financial markets opened for trading today after a three-day
holiday last week.  The yuan has advanced 1.9 percent against the dollar since
the central bank ended a two-year dollar peg on June 19. Premier
Wen Jiabao said on Sept. 22 that a 20 percent rise in the value
of the yuan would lead to severe job losses and trigger social
instability, putting the nation on course for a clash with U.S.
lawmakers who are demanding a stronger currency.  The yuan traded at 6.6200 versus the greenback in Hong Kong,
0.08 percent stronger than 6.6250 on Sept. 24, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Ven Ram ,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
