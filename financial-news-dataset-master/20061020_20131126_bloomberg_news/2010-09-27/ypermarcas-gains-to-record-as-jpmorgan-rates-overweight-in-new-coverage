Hypermarcas SA , a Brazilian
consumer-goods maker, rose to a record in Sao Paulo trading
after JPMorgan Chase & Co. initiated coverage with an
“overweight” rating.  Hypermarcas gained 2.8 percent, the most since Aug. 27, to
25.40 reais as of the 4 p.m. New York time close. That’s the
highest price since its initial public offering in April 2008.  Hypermarcas will benefit from “strong growth” in
pharmaceuticals and personal-care items,  Andrea Teixeira , an
analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients today. The
company, based in Sao Paulo, also will boost earnings by making
acquisitions in a “fragmented” industry, she wrote.  “Since its foundation, Hypermarcas has been recognized for
its capacity to consolidate other companies at accretive
valuations,” Teixeira wrote. “Its portfolio is mainly composed
of staple goods, which makes it a defensive investment. Also, as
it has multiclass products, it is well positioned to capture
social mobility.”  The shares will likely rise to 30 reais by the end of next
year, according to JPMorgan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
