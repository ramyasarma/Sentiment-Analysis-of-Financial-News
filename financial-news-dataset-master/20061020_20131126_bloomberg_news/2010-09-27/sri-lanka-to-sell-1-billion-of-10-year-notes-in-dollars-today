Sri Lanka received more than $6.3
billion of orders for a global sale of $1 billion in bonds to
help repay debt and rebuild after the end of three decades of
civil war.  The October 2020 securities were sold to yield 6.25 percent,
or 373 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities were
marketed to investors at an indicative yield of 6.5 percent,
according to two investors briefed about the sale. Bank of
America Corp., HSBC Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc managed the issue, assisted by Bank of Ceylon.  “They came in against a positive backdrop for emerging-
market bonds,” said Jetro Siekkinen, a money manager in
Helsinki at Aktia Asset Management, who oversees $7.8 billion
bonds and bought some of the new debt. “The spread is
attractive in this yield-hungry environment.”  Global investors plowed a record $27.9 billion of funds
into emerging-market debt this year through Aug. 25, according
to Barclays Capital Plc, citing data compiled by EPFR Global.
Dollar debt sold by developing nations has rallied  13 percent 
this year, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s EMBI Global Index shows.  GDP, Stock Gain  Sri Lanka’s  gross domestic product  expanded 8.5 percent in
the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier, the most
since 2002, the statistics department said Sept. 16. The $42
billion economy may grow as much as 8 percent in 2010, the
central bank said Sept. 21, having previously forecast a 7
percent expansion.  The Colombo All- Share Index  of shares has more than tripled
since the end of a 26-year civil war in May 2009, the best
performance among benchmark stock indexes. The local rupee has
strengthened 2.7 percent to 111.90 per dollar over the same
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank said in a statement today the
oversubscription reflected “high global investor confidence
based on the recent progress and the future prospects in the Sri
Lankan economy since the end of the conflict.”  The bank said orders were received from 362 investors
globally, with 85 percent of the bonds allocated to fund
managers and the balance going to pension funds, insurance
companies and banks.  S&P upgraded Sri Lanka’s credit rating one level to B+ from
B on Sept. 14, four levels below investment grade. Fitch raised
its rating outlook to positive from stable on Sept. 21. The
latest debt sale is Sri Lanka’s third global offering, following
$500 million issues of five-year bonds in October 2007 and
October 2009.  Sri Lanka’s debt has returned  42 percent  since May 18, 2009,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. That’s
when government forces defeated Tamil Tiger rebels. The return
compares with a  19 percent  gain in China,  24 percent  in Brazil
and  27 percent  in Russia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
