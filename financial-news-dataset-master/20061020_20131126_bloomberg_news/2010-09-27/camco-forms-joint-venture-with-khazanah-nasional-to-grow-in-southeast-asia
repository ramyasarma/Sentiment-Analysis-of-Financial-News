Camco International Ltd.  surged the
most since December 2008 after it formed a joint venture with
Khazanah Nasional, the investment holding arm of the Malaysian
government, to expand its carbon-trading operations in Asia.  Khazanah agreed to buy 9.28 million ordinary Camco shares
at 20 pence each, according to a statement distributed by the
Regulatory News Service. Shares in the London-based manager of
emission-reduction projects jumped 41 percent to 20.5 pence as
of 8:36 a.m. local time, the highest price since Dec. 29 last
year. The purchase will give Khazanah a 5.3-percent stake in the
company.  The joint venture will be capitalized with as much as
$46.05 million to invest in the emissions-to-energy market in
South East Asia, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
