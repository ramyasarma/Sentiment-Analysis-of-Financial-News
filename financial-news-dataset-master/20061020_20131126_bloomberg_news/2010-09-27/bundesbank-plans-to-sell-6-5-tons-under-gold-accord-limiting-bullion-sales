The Bundesbank plans to sell no
more than 6.5 metric tons of gold in the second year of an
agreement between central banks to limit bullion sales.  Germany has the world’s second-biggest gold reserves
after the U.S. It sold 5.2 tons of the metal in the first year
of the latest accord, which ended yesterday, according to data
up to Sept. 14 compiled by the World Gold Council. The most it
ever sold in one year was 12 tons in 2001, the data show.  “Apart from the sale of 6.5 tons to the Federal Finance
Ministry already agreed to, the German Bundesbank won’t make use
of the selling option available to it in the second year of the
new Gold Agreement to action any further sales,” the Frankfurt-
based Bundesbank said in the statement today.  Gold is heading for a 10th consecutive annual advance, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920, spurring central
banks globally to add the metal to reserves. Combined central
bank holdings rose in every quarter since the second quarter of
last year, data from the council show.  The first Central Bank Gold Agreement was announced more
than a decade ago because of concern that uncoordinated selling
was destabilizing the gold market and driving down prices. Gold
fell from a then-record $850 an ounce in 1980 to $253.83 in
February 2001. It reached a record $1,300.15 today.  Germany held 3,402.5 tons of gold in reserves as of this
month, compared with 8,133.5 tons for the U.S., data compiled by
the council show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
