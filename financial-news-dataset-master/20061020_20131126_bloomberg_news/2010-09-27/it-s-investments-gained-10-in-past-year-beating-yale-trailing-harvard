The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s investments rose 10 percent in the past year,
lagging behind Harvard University’s 11 percent gain and beating
Yale University’s 8.9 percent return.  The endowment’s value rose 5.1 percent to $8.3 billion in
the year ended June 30. That included $104 million in donor
gifts and $460 million in distributions to the university, MIT
said today in an e-mailed statement from Cambridge,
Massachusetts.  MIT’s fund, overseen by  Seth Alexander , generated an
average annual increase of 7.2 percent in the past five years
through June. That compares with a 4.7 percent gain at Harvard,
the richest U.S. school, and the 3.1 percent median return of
public and corporate pensions, endowments and foundations
tracked by Wilshire Associates Inc., a consulting firm in Santa
Monica, California.  MIT’s portfolio is “primarily invested in equities and
heavily weighted towards markets such as private equity, real
estate and marketable alternatives,” the statement said.  Patti Richards , a university spokeswoman, declined to comment on asset
allocation or the performance of individual asset classes.  MIT’s endowment lost 17 percent in the year ended June
2009, after the bankruptcy of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  in
September 2008 crippled financial markets. Harvard and Yale’s
investments dropped a record 25 and 27 percent respectively.  Ivy League Funds  Yale, whose endowment strategy is a model for U.S. schools,
said Sept. 24 its fund increased to $16.7 billion as of June 30,
trailing Harvard and the three other Ivy League funds that have
reported returns for the past year. Results at Yale, in New
Haven, Connecticut, were hampered by a second straight year of
losses on real estate, timber and oil and gas holdings.  Harvard’s $27.4 billion endowment rose 11 percent. Columbia
University in New York said its $6.5 billion endowment jumped 17
percent in the past year, while the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia reported its $5.7 billion fund gained 13
percent. The $3 billion fund at Dartmouth College in Hanover,
New Hampshire, gained 10 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of stocks rose 12 percent in the year ended June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
