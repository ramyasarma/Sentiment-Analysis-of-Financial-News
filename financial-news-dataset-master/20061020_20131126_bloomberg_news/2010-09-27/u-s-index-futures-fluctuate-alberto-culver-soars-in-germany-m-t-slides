U.S. stocks retreated, paring the
biggest September gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in 71
years, as investors speculated that merger talks between M&T
Bank Corp. and Banco Santander SA broke down and yield spreads
showed perceptions of Ireland and Portugal’s creditworthiness
are deteriorating.  M&T dropped 7 percent after people familiar with the matter
said the bank ended talks with Santander. Bank of America Corp.
and Travelers Cos. lost more than 1.8 percent, leading losses in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Alberto-Culver Co.  jumped 20
percent after Unilever agreed to buy the maker of hair-care
products for $3.7 billion. AirTran Holdings Inc. rose 61 percent
as Southwest Airlines Co. offered about $1.4 billion.  The  S&P 500  lost 0.6 percent to 1,142.16 as of 4 p.m. in
New York. The index has rallied 8.9 percent this month, which
would be the biggest September gain since 1939. The  Dow  slumped
48.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,812.04.  “Continued issues on the global banking front are sending
chills down the market’s spine,” said  Chad Morganlander , a
Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus &
Co., which oversees $90 billion. “Overall concern about
sustainable growth without fiscal stimulus will be the key
driver in coming months as we digest the best September in U.S.
equity markets since the ‘30s.’’  Stocks have risen four straight weeks, including the gain
between Sept. 17 and Sept. 24 as signs of improving demand for
capital goods, technology products and consumer items tempered
concern the economic rebound is slowing. The advance cut the S&P
500’s drop since this year’s high in April to 5.8 percent.
September is historically the worst month for the S&P 500, with
losses averaging 1.2 percent since 1928.  Ireland, Portugal  Investors bet that  Ireland  and Portugal’s sovereign
finances are weakening, driving up the extra yield they demand
to buy the nation’s debt instead of Germany’s to record closing
levels. The gap for 10-year Irish bonds increased to 4.30
percentage points, and Portugal’s rose to 4.15 points.  Anglo Irish Bank Corp.’s senior debt was cut to the lowest
investment grade rating by Moody’s Investors Service, which said
it may reduce the rating for the Dublin-based firm to junk
unless the government guarantees bondholders against losses. The
ratings company cut the lender’s senior unguaranteed debt to
Baa3 from A3, Moody’s said in a statement today. Anglo Irish’s
subordinated debt, guaranteed by Ireland’s government until
Sept. 29, was also downgraded to Caa1 from Ba1.  The S&P 500 advanced 2.1 percent last week.  ‘Huge Rally’  ‘‘The market’s taking a breather after the huge rally we
had last week,” said  Peter Boockvar , equity strategist at
Miller Tabak & Co. in New York. “Anglo Irish was downgraded
this morning. That took the wind out of European market sales.
That’s one of the catalysts. European bond markets, particularly
Ireland and Portugal, are not trading that great.”  M&T fell 7 percent to $84.24 after a report that talks,
which had focused on combining the Buffalo, New York-based bank
with Santander’s U.S. banking unit, fell apart late last week
over a disagreement about who would have control of the combined
institution, one of the people said.  Financial shares in the S&P 500 fell 1.2 percent as Bank of
America declined 2.7 percent to $13.24, Travelers slumped 1.8
percent to $52.16 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased 1.7 percent
to $39.08.  Alberto-Culver soared 20 percent to $37.64. Unilever, the
maker of Dove soap, agreed to buy it for $37.50 a share.  Busiest Airport  AirTran surged 61 percent to $7.34. Southwest gained 8.7
percent to $13.35. By purchasing AirTran, Southwest gains access
to Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport. The  NYSE Arca Airline
Index  rose 1.8 percent to the highest level since November 2007.  An investor who bought 759 bullish  AirTran  options last
week captured a 14-fold gain today. Trading of November $5 calls
on Sept. 21 was triple the four-week daily average for all
AirTran contracts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
calls, which changed hands for 15 cents, surged to open at $2.15
today.  “It does appear suspicious,” said  Henry Schwartz ,
president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of
options-market analytics. “Somebody may have had some
information that something was in the works.”  Jeffrey A. Hirsch , editor in chief of the “Stock Trader’s
Almanac,” said  the Dow  will surge to 38,820 in an eight-year
“super boom” beginning in 2017.  Hirsch’s forecast comes more than a decade after  James K. Glassman  and  Kevin A. Hassett  predicted the Dow would rise to
36,000 by 2005 in “Dow 36,000,” a New York Times bestseller.
The 114-year-old average ended 1999 at 11,497.12 and sank as low
as 7,286.27 in 2002 following the Internet bubble. The Dow then
jumped to a record 14,164.53 in 2007 and fell to 6,547.05 in
March 2009 after the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
