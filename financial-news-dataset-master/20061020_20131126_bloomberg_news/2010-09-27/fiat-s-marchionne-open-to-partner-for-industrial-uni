Fiat SpA Chief Executive Officer
 Sergio Marchionne  said he’s open to a possible partnership for
the truck and tractor business that is being spun off by Italy’s
largest manufacturer.  “We are in discussion and we meet people all the time in
connection with potential strategic development of the
business,” Marchionne told reporters in Rome today, when asked
about the Fiat Industrial SpA unit.  Daimler AG , the world’s
largest maker of heavy trucks, hasn’t made an offer for Fiat
Industrial, Marchionne said.  Fiat, which acquired a 20 percent stake in Chrysler Group
LLC last year, is spinning off industrial operations including
the Iveco truckmaker and the CNH Global NV tractor division to
focus on carmaking. The Turin-based company plans to list Fiat
Industrial shares on the Milan exchange on Jan. 3.  “We’ll take it one day at a time” after the listing, said
Marchionne, 58, who along with Daimler CEO  Dieter Zetsche  is
scheduled to attend the Paris Motor Show this week. “Whatever
happens, happens. The objective is to strengthen the business.”  Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler made a 9 billion-euro ($12
billion) pre-offer for Fiat Industrial this summer, La
Repubblica reported Sept. 22. After the report, Daimler said
that it wasn’t in talks about taking over Fiat’s industrial
operations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
