Transnet Ltd. plans to sell its
ship repair facilities and houses occupied by the state-owned
South African transport company’s workers, Business Report said,
citing spokesman Mboniso Sigonyela.  The company denied claims by the South African Transport &
Allied Workers’ Union that it is working on proposals to
privatize its ports, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said,
citing Sigonyela. The labor union, which earlier this year went
on an 18-day strike that crippled Transnet’s port and rail
operations, has threatened futher labor action if the
privatization isn’t halted, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
