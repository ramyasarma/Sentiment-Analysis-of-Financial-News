An anchorman for Iraq’s state
sponsored al-Iraqiyah television was seriously injured when a
bomb attached to his car exploded, the broadcaster said.  The attack on Alaa Mohsen took place today in the al-
Sayidiya neighborhood of southern Baghdad, al-Iraqiyah said.  Another al-Iraqiyah anchorman, Riyad Assariyeh, was shot
dead outside his home in the capital on Sept. 7.  A total of 230 media employees have been killed in Iraq
since the ouster of  Saddam Hussein  in the U.S.-led invasion
seven years ago, making the conflict the most lethal for
journalists since World War II, Reporters Without Borders said
in a report published on the day Assariyeh was killed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
