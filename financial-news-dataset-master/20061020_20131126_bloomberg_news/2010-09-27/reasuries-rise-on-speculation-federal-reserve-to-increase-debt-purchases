Treasuries gained after the
government’s $36 billion auction of two-year notes drew the
highest level of demand since August 2007 as investors
speculated the Federal Reserve will buy more government bonds.  Bonds rose earlier as Anglo Irish Bank Corp.’s senior debt
was cut to the lowest investment grade rating by Moody’s
Investors Service, encouraging demand for safety. The two-year
notes sold today drew a yield of 0.441 percent, the lowest since
the government began selling the securities on a quarterly basis
in September 1974. The U.S. will sell $35 billion in five-year
notes tomorrow.  “The market is getting its arms around the fact that we are
moving closer to QE II,” said  Thomas Tucci , head of U.S.
government bond trading in New York at Royal Bank of Canada, one
of 18 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. “There
is banking system sensitivity to how much exposure the European
banks have to each country. That will continue to keep a flight-
to-quality bid.”  The 10-year note yield dropped 8 basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.53 percent at 4:36 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in August 2020 increased 23/32, or
$7.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 27/32.  The current two-year note  yield  dropped 2 basis points to
0.42 percent, compared with the all-time low of 0.41 percent
touched Sept. 22. The 30-year bond yield slid 10 basis points to
3.70 percent. The rate on the one-month bill dropped to 0.0649
percent, the lowest since June 29.  Auction Demand  At today’s two-year note auction, the bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 3.78, the highest in more than three
years. The average forecast of 6 of the Fed’s primary dealers
was for a yield of 0.446 percent.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 39 percent of the notes, compared with
29.2 percent at the last auction on Aug. 24. Two-year notes drew
a then record-low yield of 0.498 percent last month.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 10.8 percent,
compared with 12.1 percent in August and an average of 14.1
percent at the past 10 auctions.  The size of the two-year note offering was the smallest
since November 2008. The Treasury will auction $29 billion in
seven-year debt on Sept. 29 in the last of three note sales
totaling $100 billion.  Market ‘Positives’  “There are a lot of positives for the market,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “There’s a lot of
cash on the sidelines, and the economic outlook is uncertain.
It’s the perfect environment to buy fixed-income.”  The Fed said in its statement after its Sept. 21 meeting
that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation if
needed to support economic recovery and to return inflation,
over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”  About $315 billion to $670 billion of quantitative easing
has been priced in by the market, a team of Deutsche Bank AG
analysts including  Dominic Konstam  and  Mustafa Chowdhury  in New
York wrote in a note to clients issued Sept. 24.  The Fed completed a program of quantitative easing in
March, purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed
securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. The central
bank was the biggest buyer of Treasuries when it bought $300
billion of U.S. debt in 2009.  Fed Debt Buying  The central bank retained last week its stance from its
Aug. 10 meeting of keeping its portfolio of securities stable at
about $2 trillion to keep money from draining out of the
financial system. The Fed will buy inflation-indexed debt
tomorrow maturing from January 2011 to February 2040.  A range of 2.50 percent to 2.70 percent for the 10-year
note yield will probably hold until traders “get in touch with
their feelings” on the probability of full-scale quantitative
easing,  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial
in Memphis, wrote in a note to clients.  Anglo Irish Bank government-guaranteed senior bonds fell
for a sixth day as investors wagered they’ll be forced to share
the cost of bailing out the nationalized lender with taxpayers.  The Sunday Times reported yesterday that Ireland’s
government may seek to buy back Anglo Irish debt at a discount
or swap it for equity in the new asset recovery bank it’s
creating. The final cost of the bailout, which has already cost
Ireland 22.9 billion euros ($31 billion), is expected to be
announced this week as the government seeks to quell concern it
will require funds from the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
