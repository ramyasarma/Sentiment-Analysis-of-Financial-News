Hochtief AG added Deutsche Bank AG
to its team of advisers as it faces a bid from Spanish builder
Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA, spokesman Christian
Gerhardus said today.  The Essen, Germany-based builder has already recruited
Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for advice
on the bid, which Hochtief management has said does not add
value. ACS already owns close to 30 percent in Germany’s largest
builder and aims to increase its holding to just above 50
percent over time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
