Economists covering the Brazilian
economy expect accelerating economic growth and faster inflation
in Brazil this year, cementing expectations that the central
bank may raise rates in the first quarter of 2011.  The economy will expand 7.53 percent in 2010, up from a
week-earlier forecast of 7.47 percent, according to the median
forecast in a Sept. 24 central bank survey of about 100
economists published today. That would be the fastest growth
since 1985, when the economy expanded 7.85 percent.  Inflation will quicken to 5.15 percent over the next 12
months, from a week-earlier forecast of 5.12 percent. This was
the fifth straight week that 12-month inflation expectations
have risen.  The elevated inflation and growth forecasts highlight
market participants’ skepticism of policy makers’ view that
slower global growth will cool Brazil’s economy,  Luis Otavio Leal , chief economist at Banco ABC SA, said in a phone interview
from Sao Paulo.  “The market bet against the central bank’s strategy of
putting all their money on this idea that external deflation
will pull down internal inflation,” Leal said. “Domestic
demand is very hot.”  Economists raised their 2010 inflation forecast to 5.05
percent, from 5.01 percent. For 2011, inflation expectations
fell to 4.94 percent, from 4.95 percent. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Policy makers on Sept. 1 held the benchmark Selic rate
unchanged at 10.75 percent after raising it a total of two
percentage points at their previous three meetings to stop the
economy from overheating. Analysts forecast the bank will hold
rates this year and raise them to 11.75 percent by the end of
2011, the survey found.  The real was little changed at 1.7122 per dollar at 9:28
a.m. New York time, from 1.7109 on Sept. 24. In the overnight
interest-rate futures market, the yield on the contract due in
January 2013, the most traded today on Sao Paulo’s BM&F
Exchange, fell two basis points to 11.77 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
