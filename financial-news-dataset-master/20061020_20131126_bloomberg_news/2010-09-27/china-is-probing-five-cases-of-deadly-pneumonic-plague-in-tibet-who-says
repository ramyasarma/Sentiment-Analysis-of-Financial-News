Health authorities in China sent
experts to the Tibet Autonomous Region, where five cases of
pneumonic plague were reported, the World Health Organization in
Beijing said.  The cases were reported in Lang county of Linzhi region.
Four of the patients were in close contact with a person who
died of the bacterial infection, and are being isolated and
treated, WHO said in an e-mailed statement today. One of the
patients is critical and the three others are in stable
condition.  Chinese health officials will conduct epidemiological
investigations, trace close contacts, and undertake prevention,
control and treatment measures in the area, the United Nations
health agency said. They have also alerted people who were in
the affected area after Sept. 18 to seek help at the local
center for disease control if they develop fever, cough or other
symptoms, WHO said.  “At this point, we don’t know how the index case was
infected, but we do know that the area is a known natural plague
focus, meaning that the disease persists among small wild
rodents, mainly marmots,” WHO said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
