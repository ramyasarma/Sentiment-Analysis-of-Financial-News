New Zealand will require foreign
buyers of large tracts of farmland to show that the acquisition
adequately safeguards and promotes the nation’s economic

ministers to respond to current and future economic concerns
about foreign investment, English said in an e-mailed statement
after concluding a review of foreign investment rules.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
