Q-Cells SE  fell in Frankfurt
trading after the German solar-panel maker said it will start a
stock rights offering and sell convertible bonds to buy back
older  convertible bonds .  The stock fell as much as 5.6 percent and was down 1.3
percent at 4.77 euros at 11:12 a.m. local time, cutting the
company’s market value to 561 million euros ($752 million). The
38-member Bloomberg Global Leaders Solar Index fell 0.6 percent.  “The conditions are far from favorable,”  Alla Gorelova ,
an analyst at Steubing AG in Frankfurt, said today in a note to
investors. “The cash situation after all the measures will
remain far from relaxed.” Gorelova reduced the stock rating to
“sell” from “hold.”  Thalheim-based Q-Cells said minutes before midnight local
time it would issue 58.8 million new shares, of which 9.9
million are being offered by bookrunners including Citigroup
Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UniCredit SpA at the price of
3.50 euros to 3.75 euros each, according to terms of the sale
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Q-Cells posted its first profit in five quarters in the
second quarter. Former Chief Executive Officer  Anton Milner 
stepped down in March amid a “loss of confidence” among
investors, the company said at the time.  The company is rated “sell” by 18 of the analysts that
cover the company, “hold” by 14, while 4 have a “buy”
recommendation on the stock, which has declined 58 percent this
year and trades at its lowest in almost five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
