The European Central Bank
considered activating the euro-region’s rescue fund to assist
Ireland in refinancing debt, German newspaper  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing unidentified government officials.  Various euro-area countries had already been told to raise
money on Ireland’s behalf if the need arose, the newspaper said,
without giving more details. In the end, the authorities decided
against the plan, it said.  The spread, or extra yield, investors demand to hold 10-
year Irish bonds instead of German debt of the same maturity
widened to a record 411 basis points last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
