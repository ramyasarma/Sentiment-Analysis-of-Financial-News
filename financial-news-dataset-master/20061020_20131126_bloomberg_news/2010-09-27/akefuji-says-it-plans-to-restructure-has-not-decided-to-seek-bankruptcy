Takefuji Corp. said it’s
considering various steps to restructure itself, following a
Nikkei newspaper report that the Japanese consumer lender is
preparing to file for bankruptcy.  “We are considering and implementing various measures
right now to revitalize our business, and it is not true that we
decided to file for bankruptcy,” the Tokyo-based company said
in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. “We will
disclose any further developments as soon as possible.”  Takefuji’s shares will start trading at 2:51 p.m. local
time, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said today. The shares are at
risk of being delisted, the exchange said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
