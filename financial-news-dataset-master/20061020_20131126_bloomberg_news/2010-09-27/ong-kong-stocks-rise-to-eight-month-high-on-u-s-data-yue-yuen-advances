Hong Kong  stocks  rose, sending the
 Hang Seng Index  to its highest level in more than eight months,

capital goods increased more than forecast.  Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd. , which makes shoes for
Nike Inc., climbed 2.1 percent after Nike reported earnings that
beat some analysts’ estimates.  Foxconn International Holdings

producer, advanced 1.5 percent after commodity prices increased.  The  Hang Seng Index  rose 1.1 percent to 22,354.08 as of
10:21 a.m. local time, headed for the highest close since Jan.
