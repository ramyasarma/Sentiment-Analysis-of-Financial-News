China’s five-year  interest-rate
swap  fell the most in more than a month on speculation the
central bank will hold off from increasing interest rates as it
allows quicker yuan appreciation.  The currency climbed 1.4 percent against the dollar in the
past 10 trading days, taking its gain to 1.9 percent since a
two-year peg was scrapped on June 19 in favor of a more flexible
exchange rate. It touched 6.6950 today, the strongest level
since the central bank unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993.  “As the yuan’s appreciation pace picks up, it’s less
necessary to raise interest rates because currency gains are
also a tightening measure,” said  Hu Hangyu , a Beijing-based
bond analyst at Citic Securities Co., China’s largest listed
brokerage. “The central bank won’t raise interest rates this
year.”  Five-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed rate needed to
receive the floating seven-day  repurchase rate , dropped six
basis points to 2.95 percent as of 12:08 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The central bank kept the yields on three-month, one-year
and three-year bills unchanged at auctions last week. It also
injected 90 billion yuan ($13.4 billion) into the financial
system last week, having withdrawn 38 billion yuan the previous
week.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  James Regan ,  Andrew Janes   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
