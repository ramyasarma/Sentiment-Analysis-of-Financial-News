Aberdeen Asset Management Plc , the
U.K.’s biggest fund manager, said funds under management rose
2.6 percent after higher inflows into equity funds.  Assets under management climbed to 168.8 billion pounds
($267 billion) at Aug. 31 from 164.5 billion pounds at the end
of June, the Aberdeen, Scotland-based fund manager said today in
a statement. The company had total net inflows of 600 million
pounds in the quarter.  “The benefits of these net inflows, supplemented by steady
market levels, are reflected in healthy profits, with the
group’s operating margin continuing at the improved level
reported at the interim stage,” the company said in the
statement.  Aberdeen climbed the most in three weeks on Sept. 23 after
the FT Alphaville blog reported Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. may increase its holding to almost 30 percent from 16
percent. The fund manager reported a decline in managed funds in
the quarter to June 30 as investors shunned riskier assets amid
concern about Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  New business in equities climbed to 2.1 billion pounds,
more than in any other division, in the two-month period. The
 MSCI World Index  climbed 4.1 percent in the period. Aberdeen
earns performance fees from customers’ investments.  Aberdeen has fully repaid all its bank debt from its
operating cashflow, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
