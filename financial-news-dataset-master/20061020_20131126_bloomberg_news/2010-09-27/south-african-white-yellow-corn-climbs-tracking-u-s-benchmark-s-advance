Corn in South Africa, the largest
producer of the grain on the continent, rose as prices gained in
the U.S., which competes for African export markets.  Corn for delivery in December advanced 1.1 percent to
$5.275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 12:09 p.m. in
Johannesburg on concern that flooding in the U.S., the world’s
largest exporter, and freezing weather in China, may damage
crops.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, added 33 rand, or 2.5
percent, to close at 1,349 rand ($192) a metric ton. Meal made
from the grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for December delivery gained 38 rand, or 2.7
percent, to 1,428 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are the world’s
biggest exporters of the grain.  Wheat for December delivery rose 19 rand, or 0.7 percent,
to 2,749 rand a ton. South Africa is the continent’s fourth-
biggest producer of the grain after Morocco, Egypt and Algeria.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
