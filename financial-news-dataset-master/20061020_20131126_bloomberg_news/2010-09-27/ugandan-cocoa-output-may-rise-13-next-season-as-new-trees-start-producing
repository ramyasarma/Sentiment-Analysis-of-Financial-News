Cocoa production in Uganda,
Africa’s biggest producer of robusta coffee, may climb as much
as 13 percent next season as new trees start bearing fruit, the
state-run Cocoa Development Project said.  Output in the 12 months through September 2011 may rise to
17,000 metric tons from an estimated 15,000 tons this season,
John Muwanga Musisi, project coordinator at the Ministry of
Agriculture, said by phone today from the capital,  Kampala .  “More trees are coming into production, giving us hope of
yielding 17,000 tons next season,” he said. “This season we
cut our forecast from 17,000 tons after realizing that less
trees had come into production.”  Uganda is encouraging cocoa-growing as part of a plan to
diversify its exports. Agriculture, predominantly coffee and
tea, generates about 22 percent of Uganda’s annual gross
domestic product, according to the African Development Bank.  The East African nation currently has 21,698 hectares
(54,284 acres) of land planted with cocoa, more than half of
which was planted during the last eight years, Muwanga said. The
varieties planted generally start yielding within three years,
he said.  Uganda plans to plant an additional 35,000 hectares with
cocoa in the next five years as part of a drive to raise
production of the chocolate ingredient to 50,000 tons by 2015-
16, Muwanga said.  “If we maintain this rate of planting, we should be able
to achieve this target in five years,” he said.  The Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa grower,
followed by Ghana, Indonesia and Nigeria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
