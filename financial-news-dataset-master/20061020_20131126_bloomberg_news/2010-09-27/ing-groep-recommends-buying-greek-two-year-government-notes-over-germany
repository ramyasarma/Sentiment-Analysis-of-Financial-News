Investors should buy  Greek two-year
notes  and hold them for 9 months in the expectation that their
higher yield will see them outperform equivalent German
government notes, according to ING Groep NV.  “The 2-year spread could withstand a widening of almost
320 basis points before the investor would have been better off
in bunds,”  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed markets debt
strategy at ING in Amsterdam, wrote in a research note today.
“The equivalent breakeven spread is 260 basis points in the 3-
year, and is still a relatively impressive 70 basis points in
the 10 year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
