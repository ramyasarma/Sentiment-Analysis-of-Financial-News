Copper may fall in New York and
London as prices at a five-month high spur some investors to
sell the metal and a stronger dollar reduces the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  Copper rose as high as $3.644 a pound, the highest intraday
level since April 12, on the Comex in New York. The euro slipped
against the dollar before Ireland discloses the cost of bailing
out Anglo Irish Bank Corp. A stronger U.S. currency makes
dollar-priced metals more expensive in terms of other monies.  “Some profit-taking on the back of the strong run of the
last week, a rising dollar and heavy resistance at the $8,000
mark” pulled prices down,  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG, said today by phone. London Metal Exchange
prices climbed as high as $7,990 a metric ton last week.  Copper for delivery in December slipped 0.15 cent to
$3.6165 a pound at 8:24 a.m. on the Comex. The most-active
contract added 2.7 percent last week. Copper for delivery in
three months was little changed at $7,943 a metric ton on the
LME.  Prices climbed 3.9 percent on the Comex in last week’s
final three days, when financial markets in China were closed
for the Mid-Autumn Festival. The country is the world’s largest
consumer of copper.  “The Chinese have made a tentative start after returning
from their holidays,”  Leon Westgate , an analyst at Standard
Bank Plc in London, said today.  $8,000 a Ton  Copper needs “something quite special” for prices to
exceed the “historic resistance level” of $8,000 a ton,
Citigroup Inc. analysts led by  Jon Bergtheil  in London said in a
report today. The metal last rose above that price on April 12,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “That something special could be some dramatically good
economic news,” the analysts said. They assessed the chance of
that happening at 25 percent, gave the same odds to a potential
“sharp” decline in copper inventories, and put the probability
of a weakening of the dollar at 50 percent.  “On the balance of these probabilities, then, we believe
it is likely that copper will at best ‘pause’ for a while,”
Citigroup said. The analysts also considered the chance that
prices might fall by around $1,500 a ton before they
“justifiably advance through old highs,” the report shows.  The euro slid from a five-month high against the dollar on
speculation European banks will need more funds. Irish Finance
Minister Brian Lenihan, who said Sept. 22 that costs to bail out
Anglo Irish will be “manageable,” is scheduled to publish the
latest estimates by Oct. 1.  Smaller Inventories  LME copper stockpiles fell 0.6 percent to 378,125 tons, the
lowest level since Nov. 4, daily exchange figures showed.
Inventories posted a 31st weekly drop in a row last week and
have slid 25 percent this year, on course for the first annual
contraction since 2004.  One party held between 30 percent and 39 percent of the
stockpiled metal as of Sept. 23, and another party accounted for
between 40 percent and 49 percent.  Orders to draw copper from inventories, or canceled
warrants, fell for a fourth day, declining 6.4 percent to 24,275
tons.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME rose 0.7 percent to
$23,775 a ton. It touched $23,950 in the prior session, the
highest intraday price since May 28, 2008. The metal is this
year’s best LME performer, up 40 percent, beating the 25 percent
gain by closest rival nickel. Production disruptions in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia bolstered prices.  A tailings dam at Zijin Mining Group’s Xinyi Yinyan tin
mine broke on Sept. 21 after a landslide triggered by heavy
rains from Typhoon Fanapi, the Fujian-based company said in a
statement yesterday.  Nickel rose 1.1 percent to $23,162 a ton and aluminum was
little changed at $2,319 a ton. Lead dropped 0.5 percent to
$2,285 a ton and zinc declined 0.9 percent to $2,227.75 a ton.  To contact the reporter on the story:
