The euro fell from a five-month
high against the dollar as renewed signs of debt problems at
European banks and countries such as Ireland and Portugal
reduced demand for assets in the 16-nation region.  The common currency weakened against 12 of its 16 most-
traded counterparts. The dollar declined earlier against most of
its major counterparts amid speculation the Federal Reserve will
take more steps to ease monetary policy, damping demand for U.S.
assets. The South African rand rallied to its strongest level in
more than 2 1/2 years.  “The situation in the periphery of Europe on the sovereign
and fiscal side is deteriorating further, not getting better,”
said  Stephen Gallo , head of market analysis at Schneider Foreign
Exchange in London. “My view of the euro is it’s damaged goods
above $1.35.”  The euro slid 0.2 percent to $1.3466 at 4:11 p.m. in New
York, from $1.3492 on Sept. 24. It touched $1.3507, the highest
level since April 20. The currency traded at 113.40 yen,
compared with 113.62 yen. The dollar traded at 84.22 yen, from
84.21 on Sept. 24.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.6 percent. Gold
traded at $1,298.60 an ounce, after rallying above $1,300 near
last week’s record high.  European Checks  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  told
lawmakers in Brussels that economic growth and inflation in the
euro region will remain moderate, signaling the bank has no
plans to raise interest rates soon.  “The market is trying to figure out which economy is worse
off,” said  Tim O’Sullivan , chief trader at FOREX.com, a unit of
the online currency trading company Gain Capital in Bedminster,
New Jersey. “It remains to be seen if there is a long-term
solution.”  The European Union was checking whether the financial help
received by the German regional lenders BayernLB, WestLB AG and
HSH Nordbank AG is compatible with European law, Der Spiegel
reported Sept. 25, citing a letter from the institution to
Germany’s deputy finance minister,  Joerg Asmussen .  The European Central Bank considered activating the euro-
region’s rescue fund to assist Ireland in refinancing debt, the
German newspaper  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  Bank Issues  “The euro can’t really seem to sustain an upward drive
against the dollar given lingering concerns about the bloc’s
banking sector.” said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in
Washington at Travelex Global Business Payments, a currency-
exchange network.  Various euro-area countries had already been told to raise
money on Ireland’s behalf if the need arose, the newspaper said,
without giving more details. In the end, the authorities decided
against the plan, the report said.  Ireland will disclose the final expenses of bailing out
 Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  this week. Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan , who said Sept. 22 that the costs will be
“manageable,” is scheduled to publish the latest estimates by
Oct. 1.  The Bank of Japan’s  Tankan survey  a quarterly  index  of
sentiment at large manufacturers rose 6 points in September, the
least since March 2009, according to the median forecast of 19
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News before tomorrow’s report.  Japan Watch  Economy Minister  Banri Kaieda  today said further BOJ cash
injections may be effective in influencing the yen, a sign Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan’s  administration wants the central bank to
step up its efforts.  Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  today said the
central bank is ready to take policy action if necessary. He
spoke at meeting with business executives in Osaka. Japan sold
yen on Sept. 15 in an effort to counter a strong yen that was
threatening an export-led economic recovery.  The South African rand rallied as gold surged to a record
and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  offered to pay as much as $4.2 billion
for Johannesburg-based  Massmart Holdings Ltd. , South Africa’s
biggest food and general goods wholesaler.  South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 0.8 percent
to 6.9648 per dollar, the strongest since January 2008, and
traded at 7.0083, from 7.0190 on Sept. 24.  Fast Growth  South Korea’s won and Taiwan’s dollar gained as global
funds added to their holdings of assets in the world’s fastest-
growing economies. The won gained 0.6 percent to 1,148.35 versus
the greenback from 1,155.25 and the Taiwan dollar climbed 0.4
percent to NT$31.385 from NT$31.495. Both reached their highest
levels since May. The Philippine peso rose 0.2 percent to
43.885, its biggest gain in a week, from 43.990.  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.2 percent in
2010, outpacing growth of 2.6 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast in July. Stock markets in
India, South Korea and Taiwan have attracted some $10 billion
from abroad this month alone, while those in Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand have taken in about $1.7 billion,
exchange data show.  “The Asian currencies rising is positive for wealth
creation in the G-10 because they’re going to import more,”
said  Sebastien Galy , a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
New York.  The Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone were two of the
worst performing currencies against the dollar and as crude oil,
the countries’ largest export, fell to less than $75 a barrel.  The loonie depreciated 0.4 percent to C$1.0286 per U.S.
dollar, compared with C$1.0241 on Sept. 24. The krone weakened
0.2 percent to 5.8971 from 5.8835.  To contact the reporters on this story:
