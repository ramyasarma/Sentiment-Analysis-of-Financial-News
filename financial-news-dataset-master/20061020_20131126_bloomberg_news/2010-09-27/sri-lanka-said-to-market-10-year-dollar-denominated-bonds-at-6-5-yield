Sri Lanka hired banks to help it
with a benchmark sale of 10-year dollar bonds, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  The bonds may price to yield around the 6.5 percent area,
the person said, without being more specific and asking not to
be identified as details are private. The central bank unveiled
plans to sell bonds in August.  The sale will be Sri Lanka’s biggest in dollars since
October, when it sold $500 million of 7.4 percent notes due
2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those notes are
trading at 108.5 cents on the dollar to yield 5.172 percent,
from 107.75 on Sept. 24, according to BNP Paribas SA prices on
Bloomberg.  Fitch Ratings raised Sri Lanka’s credit outlook to positive
from stable on Sept. 21, citing improved government finances and
a $2.5 billion International Monetary Fund loan. The central
bank kept interest rates unchanged that same day, leaving the
reverse repurchase rate at  9 percent  after consumer prices in
Colombo rose 5 percent in August from a year ago. That’s less
than half the average rate of the five years through 2009.  The Sri Lankan rupee is at its highest against the dollar
since December 2008. Standard Chartered Plc is forecasting a
faster appreciation in the rupee this year if the government
“initiates investment-friendly reforms.”  Bank of America Corp., HSBC Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc will manage the dollar bond sale, and will be
assisted by Bank of Ceylon, the person said. Fitch assigned the
bonds a B+ rating today, its fourth-highest non-investment
grade.  Benchmark typically means at least $500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
