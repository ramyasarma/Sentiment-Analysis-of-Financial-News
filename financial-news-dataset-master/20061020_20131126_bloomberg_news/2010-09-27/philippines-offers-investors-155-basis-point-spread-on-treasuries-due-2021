The Philippines set indicative
yield spreads it will pay on bonds it’s issuing as part of an
exchange of dollar-denominated debt.  The government offered to pay at least 155 basis points
more than U.S. Treasuries on bonds due in 2021 and at least 160
basis points more than Treasuries in a re-opening of its debt
due in 2034. The yield spreads are indicative because they may
change when the bonds are sold on Sept. 29, the government said
in a statement. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
