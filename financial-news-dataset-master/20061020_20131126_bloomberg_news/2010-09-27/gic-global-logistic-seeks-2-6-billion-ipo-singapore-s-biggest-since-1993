Global Logistic Properties Ltd.,
the overseas logistics unit of the  Government of Singapore
Investment Corp ., aims to raise as much as S$3.4 billion ($2.6
billion) in Singapore’s biggest initial public offering since
1993.  The company plans to offer 1.76 billion shares priced at
S$1.78 to S$1.96 each, according to a prospectus on the  Monetary
Authority of Singapore website  today. If an over-allotment
option is exercised in full, GLP said its net IPO proceeds will
be about S$3.6 billion.  GIC, manager of more than $100 billion of Singapore’s
foreign exchange reserves, bought the assets from  ProLogis , the
world’s largest owner of warehouses, for $1.3 billion in
December 2008. GLP owns, manages and leases out 296 properties
within 122 integrated parks, and its network is spread across 25
major cities in China and Japan, it said in the prospectus.  Cornerstone investors, including Owl Creek Asset Management,
 Alibaba  Group Treasury, CB Richard Ellis Global Real Estate
Securities and ING Clarion Real Estate Securities, can subscribe
to 589 million shares of the total being offered, which are not
subject to any lockup period, GLP said.  GLP, led by deputy chairman and executive director  Jeffrey Schwartz , plans to use S$1.5 billion of the IPO proceeds to
expand in China and Japan, and about S$600 million to pay down
existing shareholder loans.  The company, whose customers include  Wal-Mart China , DHL
and FedEx Corp., plans to expand in markets like India and
Vietnam when “suitable opportunities arise,” it said in the
prospectus.  JPMorgan Chase & Co . and  Citigroup Inc.  are leading a group
of investment banks arranging the IPO, including  UBS AG , China
International Capital Corp. and DBS Group Holdings Ltd.  Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.’s initial offering in the
city-state in 1993 raised more than S$4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
