Copper, little changed, may decline
for the first time in four days as the dollar rebounded against
the euro on renewed concern about Europe’s debt crisis.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to $7,902 a metric ton
before trading at $7,938 a ton at 12:33 p.m. Singapore time.
December-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained
as much as 2.5 percent to 61,300 yuan ($9,149) a ton and ended
the morning session at 60,510 yuan, the highest in five months.  “The dollar continues to exert strong influence on the
price of commodities,” Li Daijun, an analyst at Jinyou Futures
Brokerage Co., said from Fujian. “Longer term, we’re still
positive on the outlook for copper as the U.S. once again takes
steps to ensure the recovery is on track.”  The dollar strengthened against the euro before Ireland
discloses the final expenses of the bailing out of Anglo Irish
Bank Corp. this week. The euro, which dropped to $1.3474 from
$1.3492 last week, also retreated after Der Spiegel reported the
European Commission lacks confidence in the viability of German
regional lenders.  Copper may also drop as some investors in China boost
arbitrage trading to take advantage of the price gap between
Shanghai and London. The metal advanced 3.5 percent in London
from Sept. 22 to Sept. 24 while the exchange in Shanghai was
closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.  “Copper in London rallied very strongly during the time
that China was out on holiday,” said Li. “With the global
economic outlook still in question, investors turn to arbitrage
to make some money,” Li said, referring to investors selling
the metal in London and buying it in Shanghai. Arbitrage traders
profit from disparities in prices of equivalent securities or
commodities that are traded on more than one market.  Aluminum in London dropped 0.6 percent to $2,303.50 a ton,
zinc declined 1 percent to $2,225.50 a ton and lead fell 0.3
percent to $2,290 a ton. Nickel was little changed at $22,920 a
ton, while tin hadn’t traded by 12:58 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
