China Unicom  (Hong Kong) Ltd. is
seeking to raise about $1.8 billion in a convertible-bond issue,
Dow Jones Newswires said, citing a term sheet, in a report
published on the Wall Street Journal’s website.  The five-year notes will have an annual coupon of 0.5
percent to 1.0 percent, and an initial conversion price of
HK$15.56 to HK$16.15 per share, the news agency said.  Nomura
Holdings Inc .,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and  China International
Capital Corp . are organizing the sale, Dow Jones said.  China Unicom , the only Chinese carrier selling Apple Inc.’s
iPhone, will announce a major transaction, shareholder  China
United Network Communications Ltd . said in a Shanghai stock
exchange filing late yesterday evening.  China United will be suspended in Shanghai pending the
statement, and resume trading afterwards, it said, without
giving details of the deal.  Sophia Tso , a spokeswoman for China
Unicom, declined in a phone interview to give any further
information on the announcement or its timing.  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
