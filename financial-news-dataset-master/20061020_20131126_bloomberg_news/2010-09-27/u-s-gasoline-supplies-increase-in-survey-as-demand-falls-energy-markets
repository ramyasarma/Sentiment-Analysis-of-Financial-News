U.S.  gasoline inventories  probably
rose to the highest level in six months as demand slipped with
the end of the summer driving season and economic growth slowed,
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Stockpiles  climbed 350,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, in the
seven days ended Sept. 24 from 226.1 million a week earlier,
according to the median of 14 analyst estimates before an Energy
Department report tomorrow. The gain would leave supplies at the
highest level since March 12.  An increase in first-time  claims  for jobless benefits in
mid-September points to reduced gasoline demand and lower pump
prices.  Consumption  dropped 1.9 percent in the week ended Sept.
17, the smallest level since February.  Regular gasoline ,
averaged nationwide, declined for an 11th straight day to $2.691
a gallon yesterday, the AAA said on its  website .  “We’ve seen a recent major decline in gasoline demand,”
said  Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory company Cameron
Hanover Inc. in New Canaan, Connecticut. “Normally demand drops
at this time of year along with refinery utilization rates.
We’ve yet to see refiners cut back.”  Gasoline  output  has outpaced demand during the past three
weeks, according to the department. Refineries produced 9.02
million barrels a day of gasoline compared with demand of 8.85
million.  Supplies of the fuel in the week ended Sept. 17 were 15
percent higher than the five-year average for the period, the
department said.  Gasoline for October delivery declined 0.09 cent to settle
at $1.9479 a gallon today on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Crude oil for November delivery declined 34 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $76.18 a barrel.  Jobless Claims  The Labor Department reported on Sept. 23 that U.S. jobless
claims unexpectedly rose by 12,000 to 465,000 in the week ended
Sept. 18, as the unemployment rate holds near a 26-year high.  New York University Professor  Nouriel Roubini  said there’s
a high probability of another recession in the U.S. Second-
quarter gross domestic product figures for the U.S. are likely
to be revised lower after “awful” June real-estate numbers,
Roubini said at a conference in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.  U.S. fuel demand will drop 9 percent to average 18.93
million barrels a day this year, from a record 20.8 million in
2005, the Energy Department said on Sept. 8.  Refineries probably operated  at 87.2 percent of capacity,
down 0.6 percentage point from the previous week, according to
the Bloomberg survey. Operating rates unexpectedly increased 0.2
percentage point in the week ended Sept. 17  Gasoline Imports  Imports  of gasoline jumped 32 percent to 850,000 barrels a
day in the week ended Sept. 17, according to the department.
Crude oil imports increased 3.3 percent to 9.32 million barrels
a day.  “We can expect a build in gasoline because demand has been
very weak,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago. “Refineries have been running at higher
levels than expected. They are probably planning to export the
excess gasoline and distillate fuel.”  Total fuel  exports  averaged a record 2.16 million barrels a
day for a second straight week in the seven days ended Sept. 17,
according to the department.  Stockpiles  of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, probably climbed 325,000 barrels, or 0.2
percent, from 174.9 million, the survey showed. Inventories in
the week ended Aug. 20 were the most since 1983.  Falling Demand  Total fuel consumption  slipped 1.8 percent to 19.2 million
barrels a day in the week ended Sept. 17, the lowest level since
July.  Crude-oil  stockpiles  probably declined 700,000 barrels, or
0.2 percent, from 358.3 million, according to the survey.
Inventories in the week ended Sept. 17 were 13 percent higher
than the five-year average for the period, the department said.  U.S. stockpiles  of oil and fuel climbed 3.3 million barrels
to 1.14 billion in the week ended Sept. 17, the highest level
since at least 1990, when the Energy Department began to collect
weekly data. Inventories have climbed for fourteen of the past
fifteen weeks. On a monthly basis, supplies are at the highest
level since  January 1983 .  The department is scheduled to release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
