Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd.  is moving  Cathryn Carver , its global head of capital
markets, to Hong Kong from Sydney as the nation’s third-biggest
lender by market value expands in Asia.  “Asia offers our customers pools of liquidity and capital,
and opportunities to diversify their sources of funding as they
expand into the region,” Carver said in an e-mailed statement
to Bloomberg News today.  ANZ, whose third-quarter profit rose 37 percent as bad
debts shrank, is expanding in Asia as competition increases at
home. It aims to have 20 outlets in China in three years, from
seven currently, and plans to increase the proportion of profit
generated in Asia-Pacific to 20 percent by 2012, from the
current 14 percent.  The Melbourne-based lender got approval earlier this month
from China’s banking regulator to become locally incorporated in
the country and in August said it was carrying out due diligence
on  Korea Exchange Bank .  Citigroup Inc. estimates KEB, a bank ANZ Chief Executive
Officer  Mike Smith  said would “unquestionably” fit with
efforts to expand in Asia, will cost about A$6.5 billion ($6.2
billion) to buy.  Carver, who joined ANZ in 2005 from Westpac Banking Corp.
as managing director corporate and structured finance, starts in
Hong Kong on Oct. 4, a person familiar with the matter said,
asking not to be identified.  Shares in ANZ closed 2.5 percent higher at A$24.20 today,
bringing gains this year to 5.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
