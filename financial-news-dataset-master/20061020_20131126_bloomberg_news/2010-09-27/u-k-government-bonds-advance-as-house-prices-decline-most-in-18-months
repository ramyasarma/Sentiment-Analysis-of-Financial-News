Gilts rose as  house prices  in the
U.K. fell the most in 18 months in September, bolstering the
case for the Bank of England to resume asset purchases.  The advance pushed the yield on the  10-year gilt  down as
much as 6 basis points after it rose the most in almost a month
at the end of last week. Ten-year yields ended last week lower
on speculation the BOE will resume quantitative easing after
some policy makers said in the minutes of its Sept. 9 meeting
that the economy may need more stimulus.  “Weaker data doesn’t just mean weaker data; it also means
a greater chance of QE,” said  Andy Chaytor , a rates strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in London. “This period of higher
volatility is likely to continue.”  U.K. 10-year yields fell 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 2.99 percent at 12:05 p.m. in London. The 4.75 percent
security due in March 2020 gained 0.39, or 3.9 pounds per 1,000-
pound ($1,581) face amount, to 114.35. Two-year yields dropped 3
basis points to 0.65 percent.  The average cost of a home in Britain fell 0.4 percent from
the previous month to 157,600 pounds ($249,000), London-based
Hometrack Ltd. said. It was the third consecutive monthly drop
and the biggest since March 2009. Housing demand fell the most
since January 2009.  Gilts have returned 2.7 percent this quarter, compared with
1.7 percent for German government bonds and 2.2 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  The pound was little changed at $1.5834, compared with
$1.5826 on Sept. 24, and appreciated 0.3 percent to 84.98 pence
per euro, from 85.25 pence.  Outlook for Pound  Sterling may weaken because the BOE’s Monetary Policy
Committee is poised to expand asset purchases and Britain’s
“woebegone economy” faces economic challenges, according to
High Frequency Economics.  “The MPC is getting ready to reboot its Asset Purchase
Facility as soon as the next MPC meeting,”  Carl B. Weinberg ,
chief economist in Valhalla, New York, wrote in a note today.
“If it does, the pound will tumble on all cross rates.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
