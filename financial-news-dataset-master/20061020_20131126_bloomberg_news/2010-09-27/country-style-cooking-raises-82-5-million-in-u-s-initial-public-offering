Country Style Cooking Restaurant
Chain Co. surged 47 percent after the operator of 101 fast-food
outlets in China raised 18 percent more than initially sought in
its initial public offering.  The company  climbed  47 percent to $24.30 in New York Stock
Exchange trading today after selling $82.5 million in American
depositary receipts at $16.50 apiece yesterday. Country Style
Cooking had originally asked for as much as $14 each before
increasing its offer price range to $14 to $16 on Sept. 23, the
Chongqing, China-based chain’s Securities and Exchange
Commission  filings  showed.  The offering was the first of at least nine IPOs scheduled
this week, which would be the most in the U.S. in five months,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Two more mainland companies are
planning initial sales on American exchanges this week after
Chinese companies accounted for five of this year’s 10 best-
performing IPOs in the U.S., the data show.  Country Style Cooking’s offering “reflects optimism about
the Chinese consumer,” said  Lewis Kaufman , a fund manager at
Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management,
which had $56 billion in assets under management as of June 30.
“The company has a lot of growth ahead of it.”  Bank of America Corp. of Charlotte, North Carolina, and
Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG led the sale.  Wind Turbines  China Ming Yang Wind Power Group Ltd. , the Zhongshan,
China-based maker of wind turbines, may raise $400 million
tomorrow, while  ChinaCache  International Holdings Ltd., the
Beijing-based provider of Internet content to businesses and
government agencies, is seeking $66 million the same day,
filings and data compiled by Bloomberg show.  SouFun Holdings Ltd. , the Beijing-based operator of China’s
biggest property website, posted the second-largest first-day
gain for a U.S. IPO this year, climbing 73 percent on Sept. 17
after raising $125 million.  Amyris Inc., based in Emeryville, California, raised $84.8
million today, selling 5.3 million shares for $16 each,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That missed the IPO’s
forecast range of $18 to $20. The shares climbed 3.1 percent to
$16.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
