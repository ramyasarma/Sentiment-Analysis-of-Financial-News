Movements in interest-rate swaps
show government debt auctions diminish the impact Federal
Reserve purchases of Treasury securities have on government debt
yields, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Rallies in the swap rate matching the maturities of the
debt the Fed was buying were an average of 6 basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, in the two days before the central bank’s
scheduled purchase when there were no note or bond auctions,
compared with 2 basis points for all of the instances that the
Fed purchased debt, Deutsche Bank analysts led by London-based
 Francis Yared  said in a report released Sept. 24.  The rallies reverse course after the purchases, wrote the
analysts, who studied 25 buyback operations from March 25 to
June 8 in 2009 excluding two operations involving inflation-
linked debt. The Fed will buy inflation-indexed debt tomorrow
maturing from January 2011 to February 2040, while the Treasury
will sell $35 billion in five-year notes.  “ Buyback operations  should be expected to have a greater
impact when there is no contemporaneous supply pressure, the
analysts wrote. “When there is issuance, the concession
pricing” dominates the movement of yields, they wrote.  The Fed completed a program of quantitative easing in
March, purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed
securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. The central
bank was the biggest buyer of Treasuries when it bought
$300 billion of U.S. debt in 2009.  The central bank said on Aug. 10 that it would reinvest the
proceeds of maturing mortgage securities in Treasuries in order
to maintain its securities holdings at $2 trillion to prevent
money from draining out of the financial system. The Fed has
bought $34.062 billion of Treasuries since Aug. 17.  Fed ‘Accommodation’  The Fed said on Sept. 21 that it’s prepared “to provide
additional accommodation if needed to support economic recovery
and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with
its mandate.”  The difference between the rate to exchange floating- for
fixed-interest payments for  10 years  and the comparable-maturity
Treasury note yield, known as the swap spread, decreased 0.25
basis point to 3.25 basis points at 4:02 p.m. in New York  The
two-year  spread narrowed 0.6 basis point to 18.25 basis points.  The 10-year interest-rate swap spread has widened from
negative 0.75 basis point on Aug. 9, the day before the Fed
announced it would reinvest maturing mortgage proceeds in
Treasuries. The yield on  10-year notes  has fallen 31 basis
points to 2.51 percent during that period.  The first round of quantitative easing lowered the 10-year
yield from 50 to 60 basis points since November 2008, said
 Joseph Gagnon , a former Fed official who is a senior fellow at
the Peterson Institute for International Economics in
Washington, in an interview. He estimated that a second round
would “likely be at least $1 trillion” and have a smaller
market reaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
