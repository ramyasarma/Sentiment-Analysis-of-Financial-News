Alliance Trust Plc , the U.K.’s
largest listed investment trust, said the value of its assets
advanced 3.8 percent in the fiscal first half, boosted by rising
equities in emerging markets and North America.  Net asset value climbed to 392.2 pence a share at the end
of July from 377.7 pence at the end of January, the company said
in a statement today. The benchmark FTSE All-Share Index climbed
1 percent in the period.  “We remain cautiously optimistic about the global economic
recovery, whilst recognising that risks of a double dip
recession persist,” Chief Executive Officer  Katherine Garrett- Cox  said in the statement. “In our view, the overall outlook
for equity markets remains positive.”  Alliance Trust reduced investments in U.K. equities from 36
percent to 31 percent and is reinvesting the money in Asia and
other emerging markets. The trust will pay a full-year dividend
of 8.25 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
