Former French President  Jacques Chirac  will give the city of Paris 550,000 euros ($741,000) as
part of a settlement over payments for alleged fictitious jobs
during his mandate as mayor.  The  Paris city council  voted today 147 in favor of
accepting the settlement, with 13 votes against and one
abstention, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office said in a
telephone interview. The agreement is for a total civil
settlement of 2.2 million euros from Chirac and his Union for a
Popular Movement party.  Chirac has denied claims that he handed out 21 City Hall
job contracts for work done for his UMP party when he was mayor.
Excluding a two-year hiatus when he served as prime minister,
Chirac was mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995, when he was elected
president.  A Paris court will set a date on Oct. 1 for Chirac’s
criminal trial on charges related to fictitious jobs. The former
president’s attorney  Jean Veil  declined to comment when called
by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
