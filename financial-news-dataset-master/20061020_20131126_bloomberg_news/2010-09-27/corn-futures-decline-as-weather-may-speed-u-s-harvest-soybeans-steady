Corn prices fell from a two-year
high on speculation that drier conditions in the U.S. Midwest
will speed up harvesting of the country’s biggest crop. Soybeans
were little changed after rising to a 15-month peak.  Dry weather the next two weeks will firm muddy soils for
heavy farm machinery,  T-Storm Weather LLC  said today in a
report. As of Sept. 19, both the corn and soybean harvests
already were running ahead of the average for the previous five
years, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  “Harvest weather looks nearly perfect for the next two
weeks and that means a lot of corn and soybeans will be reaching
the market,” said  Gary Rhea , the president of Risk Management
Partners in Des Moines, Iowa. “The market expects to see better
yields,” after earlier results in the southern and eastern
Midwest were below farmer expectations, Rhea said.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 7.25 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $5.145 a bushel at 10:46 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The price earlier touched $5.2875, the highest level
since September 2008. On Sept. 24, the most-active contract rose
4.5 percent, the most since June 30 when the government said
U.S. farmers planted less than they planned.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.5 cent to
$11.265 a bushel the CBOT. Earlier, the commodity climbed to
$11.44, the highest price since June 2009. The oilseed, used to
make animal feed and cooking oil, advanced 5.3 percent last
week, the biggest gain in 10 months.  Harvest Progress  An estimated 18 percent of the corn crop was harvested as
of Sept. 19, up from the previous five-year average of 10
percent, the government said last week. About 8 percent of the
soybean crop was in the bin, compared with the average for the
prior five years of 6 percent.  Corn rose to a record $7.9925 on June 27, 2008, and
soybeans reached an all-time high of $16.3675 on July 3, 2008.  Recent surges in wheat and corn prices were caused by crop
failures, government policy and speculation, the United Nations’
Food and Agriculture Organization said last week. There are no
signs of a world food crisis, the agency said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
