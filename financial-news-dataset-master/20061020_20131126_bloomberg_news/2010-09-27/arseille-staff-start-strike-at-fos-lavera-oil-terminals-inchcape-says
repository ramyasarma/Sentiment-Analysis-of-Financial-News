Workers at the Fos and Lavera oil
terminals at the French port of Marseille began a “wildcat”
strike at 6 a.m. today, Inchcape Shipping Services said.  The action began because of government reforms at French
ports, Inchcape’s Marseille office said in a  notice  on the
shipping agent’s website. The duration of the action is
“undetermined,” it said.  “Vessels are alongside, disconnected and we are waiting
for harbour master’s decision to clear the port or not,”
according to the notice.  The action will likely last at least 24 hours, port
spokeswoman  Claire Battedou  said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
