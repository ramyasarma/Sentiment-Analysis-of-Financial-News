ConocoPhillips , the third-largest
U.S. oil company, said it idled some natural-gas wells in North
America because of low prices for the heating and power-plant
fuel as other projects look more attractive.  The shut-in production is in the U.S. and Canada,  Jim Mulva , chief executive officer at Houston-based ConocoPhillips,
told reporters today at a Rice University conference. Gas
futures traded in New York closed at $3.80 per million British
thermal units today. Mulva said that gas at $4 isn’t
sustainable.  The company is looking at reallocating spending to
development in the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations, Mulva said.
In Texas’s Eagle Ford, about 70 percent of output is tied to
petroleum liquids, which are produced along with gas, he said.
ConocoPhillips is ramping up commitments for the Bakken, located
in state such as North Dakota and Montana, in 2010 and 2011, he
said.  “We’ve had a small amount of production that we’ve shut in
because we feel it’s not that economic to produce and we’d
rather keep it in the ground for when we can produce it at a
later date for a little bit better financial return,” Mulva
said.  The company will comment further on gas output when it
releases earnings in October, he said.  ConocoPhillips fell 10 cents to $56.26 as of 4:01 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are the biggest U.S.
oil companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
