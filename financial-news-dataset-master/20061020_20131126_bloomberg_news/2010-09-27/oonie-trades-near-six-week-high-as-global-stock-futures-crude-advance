The Canadian dollar fell from near
a six-week high as U.S. stocks and crude oil declined and
investors speculated Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  may be
unwilling to raise interest rates further.  “We’ve got the equity markets overall, which are a little
bit softer, and oil prices, which are lower,” said  David Watt ,
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets. “You have those two situations which are conspiring to
weigh on the Canadian dollar.”  The currency, nicknamed the loonie, slipped 0.1 percent
over the past five days in the worst performance among the U.S.
dollar’s 16 major counterparts. Traders sold the greenback,
which fell against 15, after the Federal Reserve said Sept. 21
it’s willing to increase efforts to boost the U.S. economy.
Carney, citing “renewed weakness” in the U.S., said Sept. 24
there “are limits” to how far monetary policy in the two
countries can diverge.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.5 percent to C$1.0292 per
U.S. dollar at 4:38 p.m. in Toronto, after earlier rising to
C$1.0223, compared with C$1.0241 on Sept. 24. It reached
C$1.0192 on Sept. 22, the strongest level since Aug. 6. One
Canadian dollar buys 97.16 U.S. cents.  Canada’s government bonds rose, pushing the  10-year note
yield  down 7 basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.80
percent. It touched 2.79 percent, the lowest level since Aug.
31. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020
gained 62 cents to C$105.97.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index dropped 0.6 percent, and
crude oil for November delivery tumbled as much as 1.3 percent
to $75.52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude is
Canada’s largest export.  2010 Gain  The loonie has outperformed 9 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts this year, rising 2.5 percent versus the greenback
on speculation the nation’s economy will benefit from global
demand for raw materials, which account for half of Canada’s
export revenue.  “Carney’s comments about a sluggish U.S. economy are
indicative of a central bank that will be hoping for a modest,
gentle Canadian-dollar devaluation in the near term,”  Stephen Gallo , head of market analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange in
London, said via e-mail. “They may well be in luck.”  The Bank of Canada has raised the  benchmark interest rate 
three times since June, bringing it to 1 percent from a record
low 0.25 percent.  Biggest Trade Partner  The central bank of the U.S., Canada’s biggest trade
partner, said last week in a policy statement it’s prepared “to
provide additional accommodation if needed to support economic
recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels
consistent with its mandate.” The Fed kept its benchmark
interest rate at a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  U.S. consumer prices excluding food and energy increased in
August for a fifth month at an annual rate of 0.9 percent,
matching the slowest year-over-year rate of gains since 1966,
the Labor Department said Sept. 17.  Canada’s consumer price index unexpectedly fell in August,
declining 0.1 percent, and the 12-month inflation rate slowed to
1.7 percent, Statistics Canada said Sept. 21.  The nation’s gross domestic product declined 0.1 percent in
July, the first monthly drop since August 2009, according to the
median of 22 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Statistics
Canada releases the report on Sept. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
