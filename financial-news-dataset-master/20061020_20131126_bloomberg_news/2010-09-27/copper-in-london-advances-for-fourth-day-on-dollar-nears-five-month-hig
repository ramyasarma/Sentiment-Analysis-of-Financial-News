Copper advanced for a fourth day as
the dollar tumbled on speculation the Federal Reserve will ease
monetary policy, boosting the appeal of dollar-denominated
commodities.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to $7,986 a metric ton, and
trade at $7,979 a ton by 8:04 a.m. in Singapore. Copper reached
a five-month high of $7,990 a ton on Sept. 24.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
