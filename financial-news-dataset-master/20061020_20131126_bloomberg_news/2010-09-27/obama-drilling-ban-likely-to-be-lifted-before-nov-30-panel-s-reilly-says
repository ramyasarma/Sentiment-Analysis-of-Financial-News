 President Barack Obama’s
moratorium on deep-water drilling is likely to end before it is
set to expire Nov. 30, said William Reilly, co-chairman of a
presidential panel probing the BP Plc spill.  “I’ll be amazed if the moratorium is not lifted before
November 30,” Reilly said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. It’s unclear “why it’s taking so long” to restart
deep-water drilling, he said.  The administration halted drilling in waters deeper than
500 feet after BP’s Macondo well, about 40 miles (64 kilometers)
off the Louisiana coast, blew out April 20. The explosion killed
11 workers and set off the biggest U.S. oil spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
