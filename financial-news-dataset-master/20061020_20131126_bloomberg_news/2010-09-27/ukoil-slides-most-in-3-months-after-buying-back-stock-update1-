OAO Lukoil dropped the most in
almost three months after Russia’s second-largest oil producer
used an option to buy back 5 percent of its shares from
ConocoPhillips for $2.4 billion.  The stock plunged 4 percent to 1,727.36 rubles at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest loss since July 1.  The Russian company, with the assistance of a group of
investors led by UniCredit SpA, said today it acquired 42.5
million shares from Conoco. An option to buy 11.6 percent of
Lukoil’s shares from the Houston, Texas-based  oil company  at $56
a share had expired Sept. 26.  Lukoil is being “punished” by the uncertainty of what
will happen to the remainder of the stock and not participating
in a bid for the right to develop the Trebs and Titov oil fields
in Arctic Russia, said John Heisel, an equity sales trader at
Citigroup Inc. in Moscow.  OAO Bashneft and OAO Surgutneftegaz are the only companies
cleared to bid in an auction for the rights to develop the
fields, Yelena Koverga, a Natural Resources Ministry spokeswoman
said today by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
