Lau Wong-fat , a member of Hong
Kong’s cabinet and its Legislative Council, said he failed to
declare several property transactions made by businesses owned
by him and his family, the Standard reported.  Lau, who represents the Heung Yee Kuk, said he didn’t
deliberately conceal the deals, and he will make a fuller
explanation on his return to Hong Kong from Taiwan tomorrow, the
Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper reported today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
