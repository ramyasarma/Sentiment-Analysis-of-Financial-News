Emaar Properties PJSC, the United
Arab Emirates’ biggest developer, is relatively well positioned
to face the challenging domestic real-estate market, Standard &
Poor’s said.  Emaar is helped by the “high quality of its rental and
hospitality assets and the relatively low remaining exposure to
development and cash collection risk,” the rating company said
in a research note today. S&P kept the rating on Emaar
BB/Negative.  “The negative outlook reflects our view of the challenging
property market conditions in Dubai, together with Emaar’s weak
liquidity and short debt maturity profile,” S&P said. “Failure
to lengthen debt maturities could lead to a downgrade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
