Pakistan, home to nuclear-weapons
smuggler  Abdul Qadeer Khan , assumed control of the United
Nations atomic agency’s main decision-making body today.  The South Asian nation took over the  International Atomic
Energy Agency’ s 35-member board of governors, according to a
statement by the Vienna-based agency. Pakistan will chair
meetings where IAEA inspectors deliver reports on Iranian and
Syrian nuclear activities and oversee approval of atomic-
technology aid.  “All of our civil installations are under IAEA safeguards
and we are an abiding member” of the organization, Pakistan’s
envoy to Vienna, Ansar Parvez, said after today’s meeting. “We
can try to mediate in some of the things in which the IAEA has
been engaged over the last years.”  It is the first time that Pakistan has chaired the IAEA
board, which meets quarterly in the Austrian capital, since it
tested six nuclear bombs in 1998. The country had twice
previously led the agency, in 1963 and 1987. Pakistan has about
60 nuclear bombs, according to the Washington-based  Arms Control
Association , which advises U.S. lawmakers.  The UN agency has in the past sought help from Pakistani
technicians to corroborate information provided by the Iranian
government. In 2007, Iran gave UN inspectors copies of documents
obtained in 1987 from the Pakistani scientist  Khan ’s nuclear-
trafficking network, which sold atomic blueprints to Iran, Libya
and North Korea.  Pakistan, which is not a signatory of the nuclear non-
proliferation treaty, has denied international investigators
access to Khan, who developed the country’s nuclear-weapons
program.  U.S. View  “Certainly this is a key area where, to be honest, I don’t
think we’ve made a lot of progress with the Pakistanis,” said
 Cameron Munter , President  Barack Obama ’s nominee to become the
next ambassador to Pakistan, in a Sept. 23 Senate hearing.  “I
intend to raise the question again of our repeated requests to
have our people be able to interview Mr. Khan.”  “We look forward to working with Pakistan at the board of
governors,” U.S. IAEA Ambassador  Glyn Davies  said in an
interview. The IAEA declined to comment.  Pakistan, with the world’s second-biggest Muslim country
after Indonesia, is allied with U.S. forces battling Islamic
extremists in tribal areas along its border with Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
