Asian currencies rose, led by South
Korea’s won and Taiwan’s dollar, as global funds added to their
holdings of assets in the world’s fastest-growing economies.  The won gained 0.6 percent to close at 1,148.35 versus the
greenback and the Taiwan dollar climbed 0.5 percent to NT$31.47.
Both reached their highest levels since May. The Philippine peso
rose 0.4 percent to 43.89, its biggest gain in a week.  “When you look at the growth outlook, Asia is the most
attractive compared with the other regions,” said  Minori Uchida ,
senior analyst in Tokyo at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
“That encourages fund inflows into the region, helping to boost
currencies.”  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.2 percent in 2010,
outpacing growth of 2.6 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast in July. Stock markets in
India, South Korea and Taiwan have attracted some $10 billion
from abroad this month alone, while those in Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand have taken in about $1.7 billion,
exchange data show.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened on speculation the central
bank will this week raise interest rates for the second time
this year to keep inflation at bay as the economy improves.  Government data last week showed export orders and
industrial output picked up in August, while the island’s
jobless rate dropped to a 20-month low. The Central Bank of the
Republic of China (Taiwan) will increase its  discount rate on
10-day loans  by 12.5 basis points to 1.50 percent at a Sept. 30
review, according to 11 of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “There’s a big chance the central bank will raise rates
given the economy is doing good,” said  Eric Hsing , a fixed-
income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “That will
certainly drive the Taiwan dollar up.”  U.S. Data  The won climbed the most in more than three weeks as U.S.
data showing strengthening demand for capital equipment
brightened the outlook for exports. South Korea’s overseas sales
rose 15 percent from a year earlier in September, the least this
year, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before an Oct. 1 report.  China’s yuan rose to the strongest level since 1993 on
speculation the government will permit appreciation before U.S.
lawmakers vote this week on legislation pressing China to raise
the value of its currency. A bill to be voted on by the House on
Sept. 29 would let American companies petition for higher duties
on imports from China to compensate for the effect of a weak
currency.  Yuan Pressure  “Given the increasing foreign pressure and the bright
outlook for the Chinese economy, the yuan’s appreciation trend
won’t change,” said  Lu Ting , a Hong Kong-based economist at
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. “But a fast pace of appreciation
isn’t sustainable.”  The yuan gained 0.3 percent to 6.6859 per dollar as of 4:41
p.m. in Shanghai, its strongest level since the central bank
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.
Twelve-month forward contracts rose 0.1 percent to 6.5605,
projecting 1.9 percent appreciation from the spot rate.  The Thai baht gained 0.4 percent to 30.56 per dollar,
earlier touching a 13-year high of 30.55, after the finance
ministry raised its 2010 economic growth forecast for the third
time in six months. Gross domestic product will expand as much
as 7.8 percent this year, Satit Rungkasiri, head of the
ministry’s Fiscal Policy Office, said today, revising a June
estimate for growth of no more than 6 percent. He also said the
baht may strengthen to 30 by year-end.  Elsewhere, the Malaysian ringgit rose 0.2 percent to 3.0883,
earlier touching a 13-year high of 3.0860, according to
Bloomberg data. The Singapore dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to
S$1.321 and the Indonesian rupiah advanced 0.1 percent to 8,948.  To contact the reporter on this story:
