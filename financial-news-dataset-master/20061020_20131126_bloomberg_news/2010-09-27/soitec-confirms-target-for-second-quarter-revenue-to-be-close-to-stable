Soitec SA confirmed that second-
quarter sales will be close to stable excluding currency
movements.  In a statement on its website, the company said that a drop
of about 2 percent in total wafer sales will be offset by other
activities. The company repeated its target for first-half
sequential sales growth of about 20 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
