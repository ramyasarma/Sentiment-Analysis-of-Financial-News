Questerre Energy Corp.  said its
natural gas projects in Quebec aren’t affected by a provincial
ban on offshore drilling in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Questerre is exploring for gas in the St. Lawrence
lowlands, which is not part of the exploration halt, said Anela
Dido, a spokeswoman for the Calgary-based company.  “It has absolutely nothing to do with us. We participate
in onshore, and this is strictly for the Gulf and offshore
drilling and exploration in the St. Lawrence River,” she said.  Questerre fell 29 cents, or 11 percent, to C$2.47 in 4 p.m.
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the largest drop in more
than four months.  The Quebec government said exploration in the estuary and
in the northwest region of the Gulf of St. Lawrence has to be
done in the name of “sustainable development,” according to a 
statement  from the province’s natural resources ministry today.
The ministry said exploration may disrupt the tourism and
fishing industries in the area. The government ordered an
environmental review to be completed in 2012.  Petrolia Inc., a Rimouski, Quebec-based oil and gas
exploration company whose shares fell 1.9 percent on the TSX
Venture Exchange, said in a statement that its licenses aren’t
subject to the halt.  Junex Inc. Chief Financial Officer  Dave Pepin  said in a
telephone interview that the Quebec City-based company also
isn’t affected. Junex fell 3.9 percent to C$1.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
