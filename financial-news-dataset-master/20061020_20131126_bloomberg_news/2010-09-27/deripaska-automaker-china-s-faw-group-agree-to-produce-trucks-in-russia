Billionaire  Oleg Deripaska ’s  GAZ
Group  agreed with China’s  FAW Group Corp.  to produce heavy-duty
trucks in Russia as the two countries boost collaboration in the
growing machine-building industry.  FAW and GAZ Group will form a joint venture at Miass in the
Urals region to make trucks and sell them in Russia, the
Commonwealth of Independent States and abroad, GAZ Chief
Executive Officer  Bo Andersson  said today by phone from China.  The agreement marks an expansion into heavy-truck
production for GAZ, which has traditionally focused on light
commercial vehicles. Emerging markets such as Russia are set to
lead an increase in demand for trucks, Daimler AG, the world’s
biggest producer, said Sept. 21, adding that its eight-month
truck sales in Brazil, Russia, India and China rose 64 percent.  The GAZ-FAW trucks, to be made at GAZ’s plants in Miass,
will be equipped with new GAZ-designed engines, the Niznhy
Novgorod-based company said today in a statement. FAW will
provide technology and has offered to help sell other GAZ
products abroad, according to the statement.  “The memorandum signed today marks a totally new stage of
cooperation between Russian and Chinese companies in the
machine-building sector,” Deripaska said in the statement. “It
is especially important to us that GAZ Group will invest into
this equal partnership its own cutting-edge engine technology.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
