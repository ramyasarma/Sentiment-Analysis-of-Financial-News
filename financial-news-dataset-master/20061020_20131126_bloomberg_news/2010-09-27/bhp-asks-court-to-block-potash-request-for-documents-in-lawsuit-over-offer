BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
largest mining company, asked a U.S. judge to reject  Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ’s request for documents in a lawsuit
over a $40 billion hostile takeover offer.  Potash is using the lawsuit to gain confidential
information, BHP alleged in papers filed Sept. 24 in U.S.
District Court in Chicago. BHP called Potash’s demand that it
hand over large quantities of documents “burdensome” and a
“fishing expedition” and said the company waited too long to
make the request.  “The delay in initiating litigation was ‘unreasonable and
inexcusable’ and the motion could be denied on this ground
alone,” BHP claimed. A hearing in the case is scheduled for
today in the Chicago court.  BHP sought to improve its chances of acquiring Saskatoon-
based Potash “on the cheap” by seeking to “drive down” its
share price before the Aug. 17 offer, Potash said Sept. 22 in
the complaint. Potash, the world’s largest producer of its
namesake crop nutrient, rejected Melbourne-based BHP’s $130-a-
share offer as too low.  Potash is seeking a court order that would bar BHP from
taking further steps to consummate its tender offer or acquire
shares. Potash also wants the court to direct BHP to make
“corrective disclosure” to Potash shareholders about allegedly
misleading statements.  The case is Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan v. BHP Billiton,
10-06024, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
