India’s rupee climbed to its
strongest level in more than four months after overseas
investors stepped up purchases of local equities, seeking to
profit from growth in Asia’s third-largest economy.  The currency has appreciated on all but three days this
month as foreigners’  average  net purchases of India’s equities
more than doubled. The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange’s
 Sensitive Index  rose, completing its best close since January
2008.  “Investors are certain about the rupee’s direction,” said
 Naveen Raghuvanshi , a currency trader at Development Credit Bank
Ltd. in Mumbai. “The capital inflows we are seeing are driven
more by fundamentals at the moment.”  The rupee appreciated 0.5 percent to 45.0150 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 44.9950, the strongest level since
May 13.  The rupee has strengthened 4.6 percent this month, the best
performance among Asia’s 10 most-used currencies, as  foreigners 
bought $4.5 billion more local equities than they sold through
Sept. 23.  India’s $1.3 trillion economy grew 8.8 percent last quarter
from a year earlier, the fastest pace of expansion among major
economies after China and Brazil, a report showed Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
