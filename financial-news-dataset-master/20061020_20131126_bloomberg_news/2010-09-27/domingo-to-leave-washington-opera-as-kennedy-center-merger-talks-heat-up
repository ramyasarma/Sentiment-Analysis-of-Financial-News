Opera superstar  Placido Domingo  has
dropped one feather from his cap.  The 69-year-old tenor and conductor informed the Washington
National Opera today that he won’t renew his contract as the
company’s general director in June.  Days earlier, the  Los Angeles Opera  said Domingo renewed
his contract there, where he is also general director. He has
been shuttling between the companies while maintaining a lively
singing and conducting career.  This summer, he continued his exploration of the baritone
repertoire with the role of the jester Rigoletto in Mantua,
Italy.  His absences from both companies at a time when money is
tight have provoked criticism and concern.  The Los Angeles company suffered a recent fiasco with a
costly and poorly attended staging of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle.
The Washington Opera has shrunk its season and may become part
of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where it
performs.  According to the Washington Post, Domingo wrote in a letter
to the Washington Opera board that “it is time for the company
to go in new directions, including studying the possibility of a
merger with the Kennedy Center,” he wrote.  A spokeswoman for the Washington opera declined to comment
on the letter.  The prospect of a merger with the Kennedy Center wasn’t
included in the press release issued by the Washington opera,
which praised Domingo for his commitment to the company. He is
expected to continue singing there in the spring.  To contact the writer on this story:
