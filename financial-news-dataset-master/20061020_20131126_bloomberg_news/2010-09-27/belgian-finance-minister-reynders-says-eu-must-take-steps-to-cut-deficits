Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders  said European governments must take measures to reduce
budget deficits in the wake of the recession.  “There’s a budgetary risk and we need to take some
measures to go back to balanced budget,” Reynders said in a
Bloomberg Television interview in Brussels today. He also said
that authorities may need “to do more on the financial crisis,
if possible go further in the adoption of new regulation.”  Asked about Belgium’s cost of borrowing, he said the
country doesn’t “have any problem for the moment, but of
course, with a very long political crisis,” it “may be a
problem in the next months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
