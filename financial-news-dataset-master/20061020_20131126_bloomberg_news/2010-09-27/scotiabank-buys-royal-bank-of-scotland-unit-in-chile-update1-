Bank of Nova Scotia , Canada’s
third-largest bank, agreed to buy the operations of Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc in Chile to expand its international
investment-banking business.  The unit has about $900 million in assets, Toronto-based
Scotiabank said today in a statement. The price wasn’t
disclosed.  The acquisition is the second announced by Scotiabank in
the past two weeks. On Sept. 16, the lender said it agreed to
buy Dresdner Bank Brasil SA to offer capital markets and
corporate banking-related services in Brazil.  Scotiabank, which has operations in about 50 countries, has
said it wants to expand in Latin America where it can offer a
wider variety of services. The lender said it’s the seventh-
largest bank in Chile with assets of $10.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
