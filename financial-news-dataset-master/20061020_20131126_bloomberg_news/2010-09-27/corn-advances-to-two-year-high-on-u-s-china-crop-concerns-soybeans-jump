Corn rose to the highest price in
almost two years in Chicago and soybeans jumped to a 15-month
peak on concern that floods in the U.S. and freezing weather in
China may damage crops.  Corn for December delivery advanced 0.1 percent to $5.225 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris time.
The grain touched $5.2875, the highest level for the most-active
contract since Sept. 29, 2008.  Western parts of the U.S. Midwest face further harvest
delays this week as fields are very wet and some areas remain
flooded, Telvent DTN Inc. said in a Sept. 24 forecast. Northeast
China will likely have freezing conditions, potentially hurting
maturing soybeans and corn, DTN said. The U.S. is the world’s
largest exporter of both crops.  “There are so many concerns in the market right now,”
Tetsu Emori, a commodity fund manager at Astmax Co. Ltd. in
Tokyo, said by phone today. “That’s what’s attracting fresh
investment into the commodity market. Hedge funds are seeing
good trends in prices.”  November-delivery soybeans advanced 0.6 percent to $11.33 a
bushel after touching $11.44, the highest price since June 5,
2009.  As much as 40 percent of the corn crop in Minnesota, the
fourth-largest U.S. grower of the grain, may suffer reduced
yields, Bob Zelenka, executive director of the state’s Feed and
Grain Association in St. Paul, said last week.  More Bets  Hedge-fund managers and other large investors increased
their net-long positions in Chicago corn futures in the week
ended Sept. 21 to the  highest  since March 1996, according to
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. A long position
is a bet on higher prices.  Speculative long positions outnumbered short positions by
465,714 contracts in Chicago, the commission said in its
Commitments of Traders report. Net-long positions rose by 21,625
contracts, or 5 percent, from a week earlier.  Net-long positions in soybeans rose 16,681 contracts, or 11
percent, to 163,087 in the week ended Sept. 21, the  most  since
May 1997.  Supply of soybeans is tight and demand looks good, Phillip
Futures said in a research note today. The “La Nina pattern
that could cause drought in South America provided the market a
positive fundamental outlook,” it said.  Soybean planting in Brazil’s Mato Grosso and Goias states
will likely be delayed until enough rain falls to replenish soil
moisture, DTN said Sept. 24. The country is the second-largest
producer of the oilseed.  December-delivery wheat gained 0.7 percent to $7.25 a
bushel, extending the prior session’s 3.3 percent surge. Milling
wheat for November delivery rose 0.8 percent to 225.75 euros
($303.61) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
