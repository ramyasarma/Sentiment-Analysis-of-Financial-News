Air Canada  is forgoing replacing
aircraft as it tries to repay almost C$1 billion ($976 million)
of debt in the next two years while Canada’s corporate bond
market begins to outperform the rest of the world.  The flagship airline, which issued $1.09 billion of senior
secured notes in July, wants to reduce debt using cash generated
by improved operations, Chief Financial Officer  Michael Rousseau 
said Sept. 23 at a  CIBC World Markets  conference in Montreal.
The company will delay adding new planes until Boeing Co. 787s
are delivered sometime after 2012, he said.  While Montreal-based Air Canada said last month its
second-quarter earnings before various items surged to as much
as C$333 million from C$113 million a year earlier, Standard &
Poor’s said in an Aug. 12 report that efforts to reduce debt
could be hampered by demand for travel that’s returning slowly
and relatively high operating costs, including interest
payments.  “Because they’re not sitting on a truckload of cash,
paying down debt is probably a good thing to do right now,”
said  Brad Meiers , head of debt syndication at TD Securities Inc.
in Toronto. “It’s not like the cost of funds for them is
cheap.”  S&P rated  Air Canada’s  July sale of $600 million and C$300
million, first-lien secured debt B+, four steps below investment
grade, and ranks its $200 million of second-lien notes B-, two
levels lower. Air Canada’s C$300 million of 10.125 percent bonds
due in 2015 have returned 0.66 percent this month, compared with
0.58 percent for the nation’s broad high-yield market, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Relative Yields  The bond yields 8.06 percentage points more than government
debt, down from 8.21 percentage points at the end of August in a
sign of growing confidence among bondholders, the indexes show.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the nation’s corporate bonds
are outperforming the global company debt market. Dominion Bond
Rating Service Ltd. changed its outlook on the Province of Nova
Scotia to “stable” from “positive,” and the difference in
yields between Canada and U.S. two-year government bonds is
poised to widen this month by the most in two years.  Yield spreads on Canadian corporate bonds narrowed 3 basis
points last week to 144 basis points, or 1.44 percentage points,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Spreads on
Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market Corporate Index widened to
172 basis points from 171 basis points. Overall yields for
Canada company debt fell to 3.74 percent from 3.83 percent.  Losing Month  The securities have lost 0.14 percent this month, after
reinvested interest, trimming this quarter’s gain to 2.34
percent. They are up 6.87 percent for the year, compared with
8.58 percent for Merrill Lynch’s broad company debt index.  Provincial bonds’ relative yields were unchanged on the
week at 56 basis points. The debt of the 10 Canadian provinces,
with about C$277 billion outstanding, has returned 0.1 percent
in September and 3.01 percent for the quarter, compared with a
loss of 0.36 percent for governments this month and a 1.97
percent gain in the quarter.  On Sept. 24 credit rating firm DBRS changed Nova Scotia’s
outlook to “stable” from “positive,” and confirmed the
province’s A rating. The move came after Nova Scotia cut its
deficit forecast for the fiscal year that started April 1 to
C$203.2 million, or C$18.9 million less than initially
estimated, the Canadian province’s finance department said.  ‘Notable Deviation’  “The four-year fiscal plan of the new government marks a
notable deviation from the previous intention to return to a
balanced budget by 2010-11 and points to greater erosion in the
province’s financial profile than originally expected by DBRS,
even though the downturn experienced by Nova Scotia was
relatively mild in relation to other provinces,” DBRS said.  The yield on Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond
fell 7 basis points last week to 2.87 percent. The yield is up
from 2.745 percent on Aug. 31, the lowest level since March
2009. The bond  yields  about 26 basis points more than the
similar U.S. Treasury, up from 20 basis points at the end of
last week.  Canada’s two-year bond yields 1.47 percent, or about 103
basis points more than Treasuries. The  difference  has widened
about 29 basis points this month, the biggest increase since
expanding almost 48 basis points to 82 basis points in September
2008, on speculation the Bank of Canada may keep raising
interest rates while the Federal Reserve keeps its target rate
costs unchanged.  ‘Significant Benefit’  Air Canada, a former state-owned company sold in 1988,
emerged from an 18-month bankruptcy in 2004.  The airline operates one of the youngest, most fuel-
efficient fleets of any North American carrier, with an average
aircraft age of 9.7 years, according to its website. In July
2009, Air Canada concluded the renewal of its fleet with the
delivery of its 18th Boeing 777.  “Reducing debt load, if achieved, would be a significant
benefit to equity shareholders, as the high debt load and the
associated financial risk is significantly impacting equity
values,”  Walter Spracklin , an analyst with RBC Capital Markets
in Toronto, said in an e-mail.  The airline reported a cash balance of C$1.81 billion on
June 30, or about 17.8 percent of its revenue for the prior 12
months, according to S&P. The August bond sale pushed the ratio
above 20 percent, the ratings firm said.  “A sustained improvement in operating cash flow would be
crucial to Air Canada’s medium-term viability,” S&P said. “We
expect that the airline still faces numerous challenges in
achieving this as operating cash flow has been weak, albeit
improving. However, the timing and speed of market demand
recovery remain difficult to predict.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
