BHP Billiton Ltd. told analysts
it’s considering a revised expansion of its Olympic Dam copper-
uranium mine in South Australia, the Australian Financial Review
said. The company is considering a phased expansion, resulting
in a slower increase in production than originally anticipated,
the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information. Goldman Sachs JBWere said yesterday in a trading
note that copper production will increase by 200,000 tons per
year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
