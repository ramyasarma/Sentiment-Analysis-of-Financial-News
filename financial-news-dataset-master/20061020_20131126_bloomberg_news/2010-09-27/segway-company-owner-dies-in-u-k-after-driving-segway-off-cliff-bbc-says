The owner of the U.K.  Segway 
company has died after apparently driving one of his company’s
two-wheeled vehicles off a cliff into a river, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Jimi Heselden, 62, crashed into the River Wharfe in West
Yorkshire while riding around his estate yesterday, the BBC
said. He was pronounced dead at the scene and the motorized
scooter was found in the water, the news service said.  West Yorkshire Police confirmed Heselden’s identity, the
BBC said. Heselden, who founded Leeds-based  Hesco Bastion ,
bought the Segway operation this year, the news service said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
