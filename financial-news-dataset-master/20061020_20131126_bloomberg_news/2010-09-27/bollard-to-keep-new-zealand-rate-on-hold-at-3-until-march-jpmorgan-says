New Zealand central bank Governor
Alan Bollard will keep the official cash rate unchanged at 3
percent until March, JPMorgan Chase & Co said today. Previously
it expected an increase in December.  The disappointing 0.2 percent increase in gross domestic
product in the second-quarter was the tipping point, along with
implications from the Canterbury earthquake and falling
inflation expectations, Helen Kevans, economist at JPMorgan in
Sydney, said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
