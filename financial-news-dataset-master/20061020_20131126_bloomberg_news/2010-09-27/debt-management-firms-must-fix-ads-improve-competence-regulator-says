More than 100 U.K. companies that
sell services to consumers with too much debt may lose their
licenses unless they correct misleading advertising and improve
employee training and “competence.”  The 129 companies, which are known as debt-management
firms, use ads and websites that fail to reveal fees and suggest
their services are free, the  Office of Fair Trading  in London
said today.  “The level of non-compliance we found across the industry
is unacceptable,” OFT Director Ray Watson said in a statement.
“People who are heavily indebted, desperate and vulnerable need
advice which makes their problem better -- not worse.”  The antitrust regulator said it would take action against
the companies, which it didn’t identify, if they fail to give
independently audited evidence within three months that they are
complying with stricter industry guidelines.  The companies compete with free, government-funded and
charitable services, according to the OFT. Their services
include setting up debt-management plans and negotiating
settlements with creditors.  “Advisers working for debt management companies are
lacking in competence and are providing poor advice based on
inadequate information,” the OFT said in the statement.  The OFT review of the industry included onsite compliance
visits by trading-standards officers, a website “sweep” and
mystery shoppers, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
