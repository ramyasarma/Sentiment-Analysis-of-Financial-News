German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  renewed his push for tougher penalties against high-
deficit euro-region countries ahead of a meeting of the group
charged with drawing up new European Union rules.  In a letter to his counterparts before traveling to
Brussels today, Schaeuble called for payments from the EU’s so-
called structural funds to euro members failing to adhere to
deficit-reduction requirements to be suspended or permanently
revoked.  Countries that twice ignore deficit-cutting recommendations
or manipulate statistics should lose some of their EU voting
rights for a year, Schaeuble said in the letter. That sanction
would apply to votes on deficit proceedings against the country
in question and decisions concerning “the proper functioning of
economic and monetary union,” Schaeuble said.  Germany, the biggest contributor to an emergency fund for
over-indebted euro members, is pushing for tougher penalties
after bond-yield premiums for countries such as Ireland and
Portugal over benchmark German bonds rose to records last week.  The group meeting at 6 p.m. in Brussels, led by EU
President  Herman Van Rompuy , is charged with strengthening
surveillance of EU budgets and increasing peer pressure on
governments to bring budget deficits back under control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
