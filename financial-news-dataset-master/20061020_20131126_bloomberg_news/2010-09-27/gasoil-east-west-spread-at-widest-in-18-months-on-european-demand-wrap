Asia gasoil prices were at the
deepest discount to European levels in more than 18 months,
opening up the chance for traders to move shipments to Europe to
help meet heating-fuel demand.  The  East-West  gasoil spread for October widened to a
discount of $20 a barrel, according to data from broker PVM Oil
Associates. That’s the widest since March 4, 2009, indicating
it’s profitable to move cargoes to Europe from Asia.  Gasoil futures for October traded on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange are at a $2.75 a metric ton premium to the November
contract, a market situation known as backwardation and one that
indicates prompt demand is high. The premium is at the widest
since Sept. 16.  Gasoil processing profits  for Asia declined 21 cents to
$12.18 a barrel at 11:03 a.m. Singapore time, according to data
from broker PVM Oil Associates.  Gasoil  swaps rose 60 cents to
$88.70 a barrel as oil-product prices gained in tandem with
crude oil.  Oil traded near a two-week high in New York as signs of
renewed equipment purchases by factories and businesses boosted
traders’ expectations of fuel demand.  Swaps for fuel oil  gained $2.50 to $454 a ton, data from
PVM showed.  Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude widened to $6.67
a barrel from $6.25 a barrel on Sept. 24.  Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the second
half of November were bid at $686.50 a ton against offers at
$689.50 a ton at 10:14 a.m. Singapore time, according to data
from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte. First-half December lots
were bid at $688 to offers at $691 a ton.  Prices of  naphtha  for delivery between mid-November and
mid-December were at $682 a ton on Sept. 24, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. sold 55,000 tons of naphtha for
loading on Oct. 14 to Oct. 16 from Ras Tanura port, traders said.
The shipment was probably sold at a premium of $5 to $6 a ton to
Middle East prices, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
