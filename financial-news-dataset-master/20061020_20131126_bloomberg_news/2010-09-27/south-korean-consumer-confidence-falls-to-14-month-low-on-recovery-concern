South Korea’s consumer confidence
fell to the lowest level in 14 months amid concern that the
nation’s economic recovery will slow.  The  sentiment index  declined for a second straight month to
109 in September from 110 in August, the Bank of Korea said in
an e-mailed statement in Seoul today. The index’s recent peak
was a seven-year high of 117 in October. A number exceeding 100
indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  “Consumer confidence has weakened on growing concerns that
the economy will slow down after the fast growth in the first
half,” Jang Wan Sub, a senior economist at the Bank of Korea,
said before the release. “Rising prices also made them less
optimistic about their future.”  Central bank Governor  Kim Choong Soo  left  borrowing costs 
unchanged at 2.25 percent this month, joining counterparts in
Australia, Malaysia and New Zealand in pausing interest-rate
increases to assess the strength of the world recovery. Export
gains propelled Asia’s fourth-largest economy to a 7.6 percent
expansion in the first half, the fastest pace in a decade.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of the economic
outlook dropped to 108 in September from 109 in August, while
the expected inflation rate over the next year remained at 3.2
percent.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,137 households in 56 cities and was conducted by mail and
telephone between Sept. 10 and Sept. 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
