Guinea hasn’t prosecuted anyone
responsible for the killing of more than 150 opposition
supporters, one year after security forces opened fire on
demonstrators at a stadium in the capital Conakry, Human Rights
Watch said.  “Justice for the victims simply should not be allowed to
slide,” said  Corinne Dufka , a researcher with the New York-
based group, in a statement on its website.  Soldiers and police loyal to the former military regime
known as the Conseil National pour la Democratie et le
Development planned the attack in advance, HRW said.  Former CNDD leader  Moussa Dadis Camara  was wounded in an
assassination attempt in December and has been incapacitated
since. Under new leadership the country held its first round of
national elections in June. A second round will take place on
Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
