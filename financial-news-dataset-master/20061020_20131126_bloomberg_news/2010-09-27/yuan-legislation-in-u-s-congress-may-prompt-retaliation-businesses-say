China may retaliate against U.S.
businesses operating in the country if Congress passes
legislation intended to force a revaluation of the yuan,
representatives of those companies said.  China “is looking for another bad guy” after decades of
tension with Japan,  Robert Roche , the chairman of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said at a briefing in
Washington yesterday. “We are going to fit that bill.”  The House of Representatives is set to consider legislation
this week that would let companies petition for higher duties on
imports from China to compensate for the effects of a weak yuan.
Representatives of the American Chambers of Commerce in China
were in Washington warning congressional aides, administration
officials and lobbyists about rising commercial tensions between
the nations.  The group includes representatives from the China offices
of  General Electric Co. ,  Citigroup Inc.  and  Baxter International
Inc.   “This step would make it harder for us to export to
China, not easier,”  Timothy Stratford , a partner in Beijing at
Covington & Burling LLP and a former U.S. trade official, said
of the legislation that was approved by the House Ways and Means
Committee on a voice vote last week.  The U.S.  trade deficit  with China widened to $145 billion
in the first seven months of this year, from $123 billion for
the same period in 2009. The expanding deficit, unemployment
lingering at almost 10 percent and polls showing Democrats’
seats at risk heading into the election added support for the
currency bill, which has been discussed since 2005.  Gain Called Inadequate  The yuan has strengthened 1.9 percent against the dollar
since June 19, when China’s central bank said it would pursue a
more flexible exchange rate. That rate of gain is inadequate,
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  told the Ways and Means
Committee this month.  The Chinese leadership has already been persuaded that
gradually lifting the value of the yuan is in the nation’s own
interest because it will give consumers more buying power and
help control inflation, Stratford said. “They are trying to
figure out how to adjust over time,” he said.  That may be delayed by House passage of the measure, said
 Christian Murck , head of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Beijing.  “In reaction to a vote in the House, they will not be able
to move forward on that front because it will be seen to be
giving into foreign pressure,” Murck said.  Forcing China to raise the value of its currency may create
500,000 jobs in the U.S., most in manufacturing at above-average
wages, according to  C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Peterson
Institute for International Economics in Washington. China’s
currency, which is undervalued by as much as 25 percent, is the
most important trade issue facing the U.S., he said in testimony
last week.  The legislation is H.R. 2378 and S. 3134.  To contact the reporter on this story:
