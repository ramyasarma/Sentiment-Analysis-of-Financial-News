The cycle of government
infrastructure investment around the world is “a little
softer” than expected as economies recover from the global
financial crisis, Nicholas Moore, chief executive officer of
Macquarie Group Ltd., told a conference in Sydney today.  “Frankly, it’s a little softer globally than we would have
expected,” Moore said at the Forbes Global CEO conference.
Normally by this stage of a recovery “good opportunities” for
infrastructure investment would have emerged in the developed
world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
