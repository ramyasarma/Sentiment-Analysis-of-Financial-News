The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
will surge to 38,820 in an eight-year “super boom” beginning
in 2017, according to  Jeffrey A. Hirsch , editor in chief of the
“Stock Trader’s Almanac.”  “All previous major economic booms and secular bull
markets were driven by peace, inflation from war and crisis
spending, and ubiquitous enabling technologies that created
major cultural paradigm shifts and sustained prosperity,” he
wrote in a press release sent with the 44th edition of the book.  Hirsch’s forecast comes more than a decade after  James K. Glassman  and  Kevin A. Hassett  predicted the Dow would rise to
36,000 by 2005 in “Dow 36,000,” a New York Times bestseller.
The 114-year-old average ended 1999 at 11,497.12 and sank as low
as 7,286.27 in 2002 following the Internet bubble. The Dow then
jumped to a record 14,164.53 in 2007 and fell to 6,547.05 in
March 2009 after the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.  “He’s got some crazy number on there,” said  Frank Ingarra , a Stamford, Connecticut-based money manager at Hennessy
Advisors Inc., which oversees about $900 million. “We’ve had
probably one of the worst 10-year periods in history, and I
think there’s just too much overhang with the government for it
to get to those numbers.”  259% Surge  The Dow closed today at 10,812.04, meaning it must gain 259
percent, or about 8.9 percent annually in 15 years, to reach
Hirsch’s projection. It has  lost  an average of about 1.3 percent
a year since the end of 1999. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
slipped 0.9 percent a year including dividends between 1999 and
2009, the first negative return for a decade since data began in
1927, according to S&P.  The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan and
inflation caused by the wars and spending to end the financial
crisis will help push the Dow higher, Jeffrey Hirsch said in the
statement. Advances in energy technology or biotechnology may
also help spur the rally between 2017 and 2025, he said.  “I can’t throw a dart that far,” said  Liam Dalton ,
president of Axiom Capital Management Inc. in New York, which
oversees $1.4 billion. “It’s too unknowable with regard to the
things that would set up that kind of move.”  The “Stock Trader’s Almanac,”  first published  by Hirsch’s
father  Yale Hirsch  in 1967, is known for revealing  seasonal 
patterns in equity market returns. The “Best Six Months”
strategy shows that since 1950, investors made the most money
owning shares of Dow companies between Nov. 1 and April 30 and
avoiding them the rest of the year. The book includes data
showing the third year of U.S. presidents’ terms -- such as 2011
-- produce the best returns.  Jeremy Siegel  Glassman and Hassett based their forecast on work by  Jeremy Siegel , a professor of finance at the University of
Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, who had noted that since the
early 1800s, equities had never offered a negative return, after
inflation, if held for 17 years or more. To the authors, that
meant stocks were a safe bet for long-term investors if they
could handle short-run volatility.  Glassman  served  as President  George W. Bush ’s
undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and is now
executive director of the George W. Bush Institute. Hassett is
the director of economic-policy studies at the Washington-based
American Enterprise Institute and a Bloomberg News columnist.  The Dow, created on May 26, 1896, by Wall Street Journal
co-founder  Charles Dow , was initially valued at 40.94 and
 included  American Cotton Oil, Chicago Gas, Distilling & Cattle
Feeding, National Lead and Tennessee Coal & Iron. General
Electric Co. is the only remaining original member, though it
wasn’t in the average for nine years starting in 1898.  The Dow surpassed 100 in 1906 and reached 1,000 in 1972. It
topped 5,000 in 1995 after jumping 1,000 points in nine months.
It was made up of 12 stocks initially, increased to 20 in 1916
and expanded to 30 in 1928. The average’s biggest single-day
point loss was 777.68, or 7 percent, on Sept. 29, 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
