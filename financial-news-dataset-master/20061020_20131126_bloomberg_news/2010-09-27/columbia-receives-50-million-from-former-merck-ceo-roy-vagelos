Columbia University received $50
million from former  Merck & Co.  Chief Executive Officer  P. Roy Vagelos  and his wife, Diana, to help construct a medical and
graduate education building at the New York institution’s
medical campus.  The gift will support a $185 million plan to renovate the
health complex in Manhattan’s Washington Heights neighborhood,
the university said today in a statement. The donation means the
university’s medical school has raised more than $1 billion.  Vagelos, 80, who graduated from Columbia’s College of
Physician and Surgeons in 1954, is chairman of the medical
center’s Board of Visitors. He was CEO of Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey-based  Merck  from 1985 to 1994, and chairman from 1986
until 1994. He is now chairman of  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
Inc. , based in Tarrytown, New York. Diana Vagelos graduated from
Columbia’s Barnard College in 1955.  “We are training the doctors who will deliver medical
care, the scientists who will perform ground-breaking scientific
research and teachers who will train the next generation of
physicians and scientists,” the former Merck CEO said in the
statement. “It is important that their education facilities are
as exciting as medical science is today.”  Columbia was founded in 1754 and granted its first degrees
in medicine in 1769.  To contact the reporter on this story:
