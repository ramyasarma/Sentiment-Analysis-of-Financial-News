The euro fell against 15 of its 16
major counterparts as concerns intensified that European
nations’ struggles to rein in debt will slow economic growth.  The common currency retreated from a five-month high
against the dollar before reports today forecast to show German
consumer prices fell and French household spending declined.
Ireland will disclose this week the final costs of bailing out
 Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  The yen rose from an eight-week low
against the euro as global stock losses boosted demand for
Japan’s currency as a refuge.  “Europe’s economy is suffering a chronic disease,” said
 Tetsuya Inoue , chief researcher for financial markets at Nomura
Research Institute in Tokyo, a unit of Japan’s largest
brokerage. “Rescue measures may help, but won’t likely solve
problems quickly. Investors may find it hard to buy” the euro
in the long term.  The euro was at $1.3431 as of 8:10 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.3455 in New York yesterday, when it touched $1.3507, the
highest level since April 20. The yen traded at 113.21 per euro
from 113.41, after reaching 113.97 yesterday, the weakest since
Aug. 3. The dollar traded at 84.29 yen from 84.29.  The U.S. currency has dropped 8.9 percent versus the euro
this quarter, the worst performance among 16 major counterparts,
paring this year’s advance to 6.6 percent.  Germany’s consumer price index, calculated using a
harmonized European union method, fell 0.2 percent in September,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey before the government’s data due today. Consumer
spending in France dropped 0.2 percent in August, according to
another survey.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  told
lawmakers in Brussels yesterday that economic growth and
inflation in the euro region will remain moderate, signaling the
bank has no plans to raise interest rates soon.  The MSCI World Index  fell 0.2 percent and the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.6 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
