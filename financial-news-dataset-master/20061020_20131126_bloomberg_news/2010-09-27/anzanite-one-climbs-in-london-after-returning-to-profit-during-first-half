Tanzanite One Ltd. , the world’s
largest tanzanite miner, rose to a 16-week high in London
trading after returning to profit in the first half.  Tanzanite One  climbed 7.9 percent to 10.25 pence, the day’s
peak and the highest price since June 8, at the 4:30 p.m. close
of trade. The gain boosted the company’s market value to 10.9
million pounds ($17.3 million). The shares cost 42 pence each
when Tanzanite One went public in August 2004.  Net income was $728,000 after demand for the bluish-hued
gemstones recovered, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said in
a statement. Tanzanite production rose 21 percent to 1 million
carats.  Sales  jumped 74 percent to $8.6 million, of which $1.69
million was for cut stones, a proportion that Tanzanite One
plans to raise, Chief Executive Officer  Bernard Olivier  said.  “We are seeing a definite increase over the last three
quarters in demand and prices, and we are hoping that will
continue,” the CEO said today by telephone. “We definitely
haven’t seen the peak yet.”  The company decided against paying a dividend, saying it
wants to have a “significant cash reserve” before restoring
payouts. “Since we’ve only now returned to profitability, I
doubt it will be this year,” Olivier said.  Tanzanite , which is 1,000 times rarer than  diamonds , is
mined from the world’s only known deposit, at the foot of  Mount
Kilimanjaro , Africa’s tallest peak. The company had a net loss
of $546,000 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
