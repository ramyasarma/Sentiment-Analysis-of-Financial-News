Mongolian Mining Corp. , the
country’s biggest privately owned coking coal producer, boosted
the amount it’s seeking from an initial share sale in Hong Kong
as demand for stock rises in a market trading at the highest
level in more than eight months.  The company and its shareholders are targeting as much as
HK$5.44 billion ($701 million) from the sale of 719.4 million
shares at HK$6.48 to HK$7.56 apiece, according to terms for the
sale. The amount is 3 percent above the maximum HK$5.28 billion
sought under the previous price range.  Mongolian Mining’s IPO will be the biggest on record by a
company from the landlocked Asian nation, according to data 
compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1999. The stock being
sold represents about 20 percent of the company, according to
initial terms for the transaction, which would give Mongolian
Mining an estimated market capitalization of $3.5 billion.  “Receptions should be positive for such stocks as coking
coal is scarce compared with thermal coal,” said  Lawrence Lau ,
an analyst of Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. “The market
sentiment has improved with people taking on more risk.”  Mongolian Mining is selling shares in Hong Kong where the
Hang Seng Index has surged 9.1 percent from a six-week low on
Aug. 31 amid rising confidence in the global economy. The gauge
gained 1.1 percent as of 2:41 p.m. today, set to close at the
highest level since Jan. 11.  Price Forecasts  Citigroup Inc.  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  are managing
Mongolian Mining’s IPO. The shares are being priced at 11.6
times to 13.6 times the company’s forecast 2011 profit and 7.6
to 8.9 times its estimated 2012 earnings, according to the term
sheet obtained today.  Of the proceeds, about 50 percent will be used to improve
transport links and infrastructure, Chief Executive Officer
Battsengel Gotov told a press briefing in Hong Kong today. About
40 percent will go toward exploration and acquisitions, he said.  Production at the company’s pit at Ukhaa Khudag was
1.8 million metric tons in 2009 and will likely rise to 3.8
million tons this year, Gotov said. The company plans to raise
production to 15 million tons a year by 2013 to meet increasing
demand for coking coal among China’s steelmakers, he said.  Mongolian Mining is based in the Tavan Tolgoi area, south
of Ulaanbaatar and about 240 kilometers (149 miles) from the
border with China. Tavan Tolgoi holds about 6 billion metric
tons of coal in the deserts of southern Mongolia, making it one
of the world’s largest unexploited reserves of the fuel.  Previously, Mongolian Mining and its investors planned to
sell shares at HK$6.29 to HK$7.34 apiece, according to last
week’s term sheet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
