Canadian stocks  rose to a five-
month high as gold producers advanced on demand for alternative
investments after U.S. consumer confidence fell.  Barrick Gold Corp. , the world’s largest producer, rose 2.7
percent as the precious metal jumped to an all-time high of
$1,309.80 an ounce.  Kinross Gold Corp.  increased 2.1 percent.
 Research In Motion Ltd. , declined 2.6 percent after saying its
BlackBerry PlayBook tablet will be released in the U.S. in early
2011, missing the holiday spending season.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  gained 88.28
points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,278.88 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
highest level since April 26. An index of gold and materials
stocks  rebounded  from an earlier decline after the 10 a.m. U.S.
confidence report, gaining 1.9 percent for the biggest rally in
the S&P/TSX.  “There’s a volatility going back and forth in the
market,” said  Sadiq Adatia , who helps manage C$12 billion
($11.6 billion) as chief investment officer at Russell
Investment Canada in Toronto. “People are spending their money
picking up names that are a little bit more secure.”  Confidence among U.S. consumers fell in September to the
lowest level in seven months as Americans became more
pessimistic about the labor market. The Conference Board’s
confidence index declined to 48.5 from 53.2 the prior month. The
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for
a decline to 52.1.  Gold, Greenback  “It was a gold day. It was a U.S. dollar weakness day,”
said Keith McLean, co-manager of GMP Investment Management LP’s
C$300 million ($285 million) Diversified Alpha Fund. “Almost
half the move of the benchmark was driven by the gold move on
the quantitative-easing potential from the United States."  Barrick rose 2.7 percent to C$48.26 as gold rose to a
record for the eighth time in two weeks as the U.S. dollar
dropped to the lowest level since early February. Kinross,
Canada’s third-biggest producer, increased 2.1 percent to
C$19.65.  Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.  rose 5.7 percent to C$25.22. The mining
company drilling at the Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia found
almost 1 kilometer of near-continuous copper and gold
mineralization. The site is on schedule for production in late
2012, the company said in a statement.  Osisko Mining Corp.  gained 6.8 percent to C$14.66, the
biggest gain in the S&P/TSX, after GMP Securities LP equity
analyst  Andrew Mikitchook  gave the gold exploration company a
new ‘‘buy’’ rating and a share-price estimate of C$17.25.  Market Resilience  ‘‘Things have been turning pretty fast,’’ said Greg Eckel,
who helps oversee C$900 million ($870 million) as a money
manager at Morgan Meighen & Associates Ltd. in Toronto. ‘‘There
has been a resilience in the market as to the downside reaction,
which is somewhat encouraging.’’  Richmont Mines Inc.  advanced 4.8 percent to C$5.27. The
gold exploration and development company said it started a
5,500-meter drilling program on its Monique Property, located
near Val-d’Or, Quebec.  RIM, the country’s biggest technology company, declined 2.6
percent to C$48.40. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company is
racing to get its tablet into stores as Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Samsung Electronics Co. and Motorola Inc. build similar devices
to emulate the success of Apple Inc.’s iPad.  Richelieu Hardware Ltd.  gained 0.2 percent to C$27.11, a
record closing price. The maker of hardware for cabinets,
