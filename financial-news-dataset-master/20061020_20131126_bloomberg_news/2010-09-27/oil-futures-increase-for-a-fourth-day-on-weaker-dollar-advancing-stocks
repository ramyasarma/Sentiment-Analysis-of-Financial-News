Crude oil futures were little
changed as U.S. stocks rebounded from an early decline and the
dollar fluctuated against the euro.  Oil rose 72 cents in the last hour of trading to erase a
loss as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rebounded. The greenback
was steady against the euro on renewed signs of debt problems at
banks in the 16-nation region.  “The equity market is back up unchanged, that brings crude
unchanged,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a market strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “Crude oil is very
susceptible to currencies and equities right now.”  Crude for November delivery rose 3 cents to settle at
$76.52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price
ranged from $75.52 to $77.17, the highest level since Sept. 14.  “After a brief period over the past few weeks where the
oil market appeared to disconnect from equities, the linkage
appears to be alive and well again,” analysts including
 Lawrence Eagles  at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a report today.  The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities rose 0.2
percent to 284.08 at 2:30 p.m. in New York. The dollar gained
0.1 percent against the euro to $1.3474. November crude rose 2.1
percent last week as the dollar weakened after the Federal
Reserve said it may take more steps to ease monetary policy.  The Standard and Poor’s index rose 0.1 percent at 2:30 p.m.
before falling 0.6 percent to 1,142.16 at 4:28 p.m.  Brent crude oil for November delivery fell 30 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $78.57 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  ‘Hard to Get Bullish’  “The dollar and the stock market are the two drivers,”
said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors in
Houston. “We have tons of inventories and it’s kind of hard to
get bullish. Clearly there is not a physical shortage of oil.”  Crude supplies  rose 970,000 barrels to 358.3 million in the
week ended Sept. 17, 13 percent above the five-year average, the
Energy Department reported last week.  Total petroleum supplies, including crude oil and fuel,
rose 3.3 million barrels to 1.14 billion, the highest since at
least 1990, according to the department.  “There is so much supply right now and that seems to be
weighing on the oil market,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst with
PFGBest in Chicago.  Total consumption of petroleum products averaged 19.2
million barrels a day in the week ended Sept. 17, down 1.8
percent from the seven days ending Sept. 10, the department
report showed.  OPEC Outlook  Kuwait doesn’t expect the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to change its production quotas at its
meeting on Oct. 14, Oil Minister Sheikh  Ahmad al-Abdullah al- Sabah  said today.  In a report this month, OPEC trimmed the outlook for demand
for its members’ crude in 2011 as output from outside the group
increases. Al-Sabah said he expects the price of oil in the
first quarter of next year to range from $75 to $85 a barrel.  Nigerian Oil Minister  Diezani Alison-Madueke  said in
Houston that she’ll seek an oil-production quota increase for
the African country when OPEC meets.  The JPMorgan analysts said OPEC “is content to let prices
rise and will only take decisive action if oil moves outside of
a $65- to $100-per-barrel range.”  Hedge funds and other large investors reduced their bets on
higher oil prices in the week ended Sept. 21 after Enbridge
Energy Partners LP restarted its 6A oil pipeline, the largest
conduit linking Canada and the U.S. Midwest, on Sept. 17.  Net-long positions  on crude futures and options combined
fell 16,286, or 13 percent, to 106,323, according to the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of
Traders report.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 543,269 contracts as of 4:30
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 628,535
contracts on Sept. 24, 2.4 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.32 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
