George Blanda , who played
professional football for a record 26 seasons and helped win
three championships in the American Football League, has died at
age 83.  Blanda, a quarterback and place kicker, played for the
Chicago Bears, Baltimore Colts, Houston Oilers and Oakland
Raiders, who announced his death in a news release. He retired
at age 48 having score 2,002 points, the most in National
Football League history at the time, and was inducted into the
Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1981.  Blanda’s career spanned 340 games over 26 seasons, the
 longest  in pro football history, according to the Hall of Fame’s
website. The cause of his death wasn’t released.  “We are deeply saddened by the passing of the great George
Blanda,” the Raiders’ statement said. “George was a brave
Raider and close personal friend of owner  Al Davis .”  In 1970 with the Raiders, Blanda accounted for the tying or
winning points in the closing minutes of five consecutive games.
He remains the oldest player to compete in an NFL game (48
years, 109 days) and one of two players in league history to
play in four decades.  Blanda is survived by his wife, Betty, and 11 children. The
time and place for a memorial service will be announced later,
the Raiders said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
