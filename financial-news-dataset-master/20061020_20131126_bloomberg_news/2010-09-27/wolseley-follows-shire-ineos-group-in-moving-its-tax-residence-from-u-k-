Wolseley Plc , the world’s largest
supplier of heating and plumbing products, said it will create
a holding company in Jersey and move its tax residence to
Switzerland after its net loss for the year narrowed.  The company will create a new holding company, New
Wolseley, registered on the island in the English Channel and
will pay tax in Switzerland, it said in a statement today.
Wolseley reported a net loss of 340 million pounds ($538
million) for the year to July 31, compared with a loss of 1.17
billion pounds a year earlier.  Wolseley follows U.K. companies Shire Plc and Ineos Group
Holdings Plc in moving where they are based in order to pay
less tax. The move won’t affect tax on the U.K. business, the
company said. New Wolseley will have the same board and
management team as Wolseley.  “The proposals will not result in any changes in the day-
to-day operations of the business of the group or its
strategy,” the company said.  Deutsche Bank AG and Merrill Lynch International are
acting as joint sponsors to New Wolseley’s listing and as joint
corporate brokers.  Gareth Davis  will succeed  John Whybrow  as chairman after
the annual general meeting on Jan. 20, the company said in a
separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
