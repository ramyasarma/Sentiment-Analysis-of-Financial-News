European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said economic growth and inflation in the
euro region will remain moderate, signaling the bank has no
plans to raise interest rates soon.  While the ECB’s monetary-policy stance is
“accommodative,” the Governing Council considers the current
interest rates “appropriate” for the inflation outlook,
Trichet told lawmakers in Brussels today. “The rate of
inflation could increase slightly in the short term but should
remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon.”  ECB has kept its  benchmark interest rate  at a record low of
1 percent for more than a year and decided this month to extend
unlimited liquidity support to banks into 2011, giving them more
time to patch up their balance sheets as the euro-area recovery
shows signs of weakening.  “We expect the recovery to proceed at a moderate pace,
with a positive underlying momentum but also with uncertainty
surrounding the outlook,” Trichet said.  The ECB forecasts the economy of the 16-nation currency
region will grow 1.6 percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2011.
Inflation is predicted to average 1.6 percent this year and 1.7
percent next year, below the bank’s 2 percent limit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
