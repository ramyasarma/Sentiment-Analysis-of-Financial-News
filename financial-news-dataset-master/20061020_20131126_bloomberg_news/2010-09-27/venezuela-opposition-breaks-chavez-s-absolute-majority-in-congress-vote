     Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) --Opponents of Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez broke the government’s absolute majority in
congressional elections after winning 52 percent of the popular
vote.   Opposition candidates won at least 61 seats in the
congressional voting yesterday compared with 90 seats for
Chavez’s PSUV party, according to results released by the
National Electoral Council. Another 11 seats remain to be
decided and 3 seats were won by unaligned indigenous candidates.  Chavez needed to win 110 seats to maintain the absolute
majority required to be given decree powers, approve the
national budget and pass other laws without negotiating with the
opposition.  Opposition leader Ramon Guillermo Aveledo said his
Democratic Unity Table alliance won 52 percent of the popular
vote.   To contact the reporter on this story:
