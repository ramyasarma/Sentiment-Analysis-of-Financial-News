Cattle futures rose the most in
five weeks on speculation that last week’s 3.8 percent decline
was exaggerated as demand for U.S. beef is expected to increase.
Hogs also gained.  Spot-steer  prices were steady last week, and wholesale
 choice beef  was up at midday after climbing 0.5 percent last
week. Demand tends to improve in the fourth quarter as retailers
stock up for end-of-year holidays, and the dollar’s slide to a
seven-month low may boost U.S. meat exports, said  Troy Vetterkind , the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in Chicago.  “Certainly, futures would look a little undervalued, given
last week’s cash prices,” Vetterkind said. “We saw a lot of
fund liquidation in futures last week, because open interest
went down every day.”  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 1.175 cents, or
1.2 percent, to settle at 99.3 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain for the contract
since Aug. 19. The commodity  has climbed 15 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement advanced
0.675 cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.09775 a pound. Wholesale
choice beef rose 0.1 percent to $1.5754.  Speculators cut their net-long positions, or bets for a
price increase, in cattle futures and options by 1.2 percent in
the week ended Sept. 21, the first decline since late June,
government data show.  Hog Market  Hog futures for December settlement advanced 0.325 cent, or
0.4 percent, to 76.775 cents a pound. The price has gained 17
percent this year.  Futures fluctuated after the U.S. Department of Agriculture
reported hog inventories that were close to analysts’ estimates.  The breeding herd was 1.8 percent smaller on Sept. 1 than a
year earlier, at 5.77 million animals, the agency said Sept. 24
after markets closed in Chicago. Twelve analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey expected a 1.5 percent drop.  Tighter supplies of slaughter-ready animals may boost
futures, said  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar
Commodity Investments Co. in Minneapolis. The supply of hogs
weighing 180 pounds (82 kilograms) or more was 5.6 percent
smaller at the end of August than a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected a 4.7 percent drop.  “Some of it was probably because of poorer-quality corn
and the hogs just not gaining as much weight,” Mayer said.
“Other than that, it was a pretty blasé report.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
