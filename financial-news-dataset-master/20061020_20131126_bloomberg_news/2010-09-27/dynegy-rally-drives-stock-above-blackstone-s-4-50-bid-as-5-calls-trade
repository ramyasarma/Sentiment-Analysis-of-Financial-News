Dynegy Inc. shares rallied above
the $4.50 price that Blackstone Group LP  agreed  to pay for the
power producer and options traders boosted bets the stock will
advance to $5 even after the deadline for competing bids passed
last week.  Dynegy rose 6 percent to $4.80 at 4 p.m. in New York.
Almost 18,000 options that give the right to purchase the shares
changed hands, with 99 percent of the volume in December $5
calls and October $5 calls. Today’s call volume exceeded puts to
sell by 16-to-1 and was the second highest on record after Aug.
13, when Blackstone agreed to acquire Dynegy.  Charles Fishman , a utilities industry analyst at Pritchard
Capital Partners LLC, said in a Sept. 24 report that New York-
based Blackstone may “modestly” raise its offer to buy Dynegy
of Houston. Dynegy shareholders meet Nov. 17 to vote on
Blackstone’s bid.  “Some people believe that there’s a chance of a bump to
appease the shareholders who may be dissenting on the
valuation,” said  Sachin Shah , a special situations and merger
arbitrage strategist at Capstone Global Markets LLC in New York.
“The possibility that someone else can still come in here is
what’s driving the stock and option activity.”  Peter Rose , a Blackstone spokesman, and Dynegy’s  David Byford  declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
