Gazprom OAO and China National
Petroleum Corp. will today sign an agreement on the expanded
conditions for gas deliveries to China, Alexander Medvedev, 
deputy chief executive officer at Gazprom, said in Beijing.  Gazprom agreed on the “parameters” for natural-gas supplies
to China that may start in 2015, the Moscow-based gas company
said last week in an e-mailed statement, without providing
details. The expanded accord on supply terms to be signed today
will serve as the basis for a future contract, Medvedev said
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
