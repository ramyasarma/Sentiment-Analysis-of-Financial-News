President Barack Obama said today
that the future of the U.S. economy is dependent on improving
the education system.  Obama, speaking on NBC’s “Today” show, said it’s not a
problem that the U.S. can spend its way out of. “Money, without
reform, will not fix the problem,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
