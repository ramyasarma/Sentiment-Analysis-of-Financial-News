The Bank of England is trying to
get the British economy back to a “reasonable” level of
activity and can then increase interest rates again, Deputy
Governor Charles Bean said.  “The action that we’re taking now is designed to get the
economy back to a reasonable level of activity as soon as we
can,” Bean said in an interview with Channel 4 News broadcast
on its website. “The faster we can achieve that, the sooner
interest rates will get back to more normal levels.  ‘‘Were we not to have taken the action that we have done,
the situation would have been far worse, because unemployment
would have been higher, wage growth would have been lower, and
so forth,’’ he said.  Bean said that ‘‘I would certainly not expect bank rate to
stay very close to zero for a decade or more.’’ He said that ‘‘I
fully sympathize’’ with savers having to cope with low returns
on their capital. It may make sense for savers to spend their
capital a bit, he said.   ‘‘What we’re trying to do by our policy is encourage more
spending,’’ he said. ‘‘Ideally we’d like to see that in the form
of more business spending but part of the mechanism that might
encourage that is having more household spending so in the short
term we want to see households not saving more but spending
more.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
