Japanese  stocks  fell on speculation
that European government finances are worsening, raising concern
the global recovery will stall, and as most companies in the
Topix index went ex-dividend today.  Kyocera Corp. , an electronic-component maker that gets 18
percent of its revenue in Europe, lost 2.2 percent. Shionogi &
Co., a drugmaker, retreated 1.7 percent, after Barclays Capital
reduced its investment recommendation. Taiyo Yuden Co., a maker
of electronic parts, dropped 2 percent after the company
reversed its first-half profit forecast to a net loss.  Takefuji
Corp. , Japan’s third-largest consumer lender, tumbled 32 percent
as it will file for bankruptcy protection today, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the matter.  “The impact of ex-dividend is the major reason for
declines in the stock market today,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $111 billion. “Debt issues in Europe have
remained unresolved, and I don’t see anything improving.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.1 percent to 9,495.76
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader  Topix  index declined
0.8 percent to 842.65, with almost twice as many stocks
retreating as rising.  About 1,400 companies went ex-dividend today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors who bought those stocks
won’t be entitled to receive dividends for April-September. That
will erase about 63 points from the Nikkei 225, according to
SMBC Friend Securities.  Small Trading Volume  The Topix has declined 7.2 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 2.4 percent by the  S&P 500  and 3.6 percent by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
15 times estimated  earnings , compared with 13.7 times for the
S&P 500 and 12 times for the Stoxx 600.  The  total value  of stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange’s first section amounted to 990 million yen ($11.8
million), the lowest since Sept. 9.  “The value of shares traded was small after investors had
bought stocks to obtain rights to dividends,” said  Masatsugu Okeya , a fund manager at Chiba-Gin Asset Management Co. “Some
investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of tomorrow’s release of
the Tankan survey results.”  A Topix industry group that includes  Nomura Holdings Inc. ,
Japan’s biggest brokerage, declined the most among the 33
sectors. Nomura declined 3.3 percent to 408 yen, the lowest
level since October 1982. Nomura’s smaller rival Daiwa
Securities Group Inc. slumped 2.9 percent to 339 yen.  Record Irish Spreads  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index dropped 0.6 percent yesterday in New
York. Financial companies declined as investors speculated that
merger talks between M&T Bank Corp. and Banco Santander SA broke
down and yield spreads showed perceptions of Ireland and
Portugal’s creditworthiness are deteriorating.  The extra yield investors demanded to buy Irish 10-year
bonds instead of Germany’s bunds widened to a record yesterday.
Anglo Irish Bank Corp.’s senior debt was cut to the lowest
investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service, which said it may
reduce the rating for the Dublin-based company to junk unless
the government guarantees bondholders against losses.  “Concerns about the global economic outlook haven’t
cleared,” said  Yasushi Noguchi , a strategist in Tokyo at SMBC
Friend Securities Co. “There are still issues related to
Europe’s debt.”  Kyocera, TDK Decline  Kyocera and  TDK Corp. , electronic-components makers which
derive at least 14 percent of their revenue in Europe, were the
heaviest drags on the Nikkei. Sony Corp., an electronics maker
that gets almost 70 percent of its sales overseas, lost 1.1
percent to 2,593 yen.  Shionogi slumped 1.7 percent to 1,532 yen. The drugmaker
had its  rating  reduced to “equal weight” from “overweight”
at Barclays Capital. The share price estimate was cut to 1,500
yen from 2,100 yen at the brokerage.  Taiyo Yuden retreated 2 percent to 1,022 yen. The company
plans to  reduce staff  in its recording-media unit by 45 percent
as demand shrinks for data-storage CDs and DVDs. It forecast a
net loss of 2.8 billion yen in the six months ending Sept. 30,
reversing its previous estimate for net income of 4.5 billion
yen, according to a statement.  Takefuji plummeted by its daily limit of 55 yen, or 32
percent, to 116 yen, the biggest drop and the lowest level since
its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December 1998. The
company will file for  bankruptcy protection  today, according to
a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Steelmakers had the second-largest advance among the 33
 industry groups  in the Topix as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
JFE Holdings Inc. will benefit from an expected decline in
exports of steel from China. The brokerage expects Chinese steel
exports to drop sharply in 2011-12 from this year’s estimated
levels amid production cuts.  JFE gained 0.5 percent to 2,629 yen. Nippon Steel Corp.,
Japan’s biggest steelmaker, advanced 1.1 percent to 288 yen.
Kobe Steel Ltd. gained 1.3 percent to 197 yen.  To contact the reporter for this story:
