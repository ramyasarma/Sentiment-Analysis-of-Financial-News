Yuan forwards strengthened for an
eighth day, the longest run of gains in more than five months,
before U.S. lawmakers vote this week on legislation pressing
China to raise the value of its currency.  Twelve-month contracts rose 0.3 percent to 6.5525 per
dollar as of 8:36 a.m. in Hong Kong, projecting a 2.4 percent
appreciation from the yuan’s spot rate of 6.7079.  U.S. legislation to be voted on by the House on Sept. 29
would let American companies petition for higher duties on
imports from China to compensate for the effect of a weak
currency.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
