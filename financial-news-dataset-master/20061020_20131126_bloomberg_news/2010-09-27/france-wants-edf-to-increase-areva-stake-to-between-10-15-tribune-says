The French government wants
Electricite de France SA to lift its stake in Areva SA to
between 10 percent and 15 percent, daily La Tribune reported,
citing an unidentified person close to the president’s office.  Such an increase, from a current level of 2.4 percent,
would involve a reduction in the role in Areva played by
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., according to the newspaper.  The government is also studying options for Areva’s mining
activity, which include opening the capital to new investors or
merging the unit with Eramet SA, the newspaper said.  France may also set up a committee to study the succession
to Areva Chief Executive Officer Anne Lauvergeon as early as
mid-November, La Tribune said. Lauvergeon has said internally
that she would like to become chief executive officer of Air
France-KLM Group, according to La Tribune.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
