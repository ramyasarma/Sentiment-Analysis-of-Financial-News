Manchester United forward Wayne
Rooney won’t travel to Spain for a Champions League match with
Valencia because of an ankle injury, the club said.  The 24-year-old was hurt in a 2-2 tie at Bolton yesterday,
although the “injury is not thought to be serious,” United
said today in a statement on its website. The team plays
Valencia in two days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
