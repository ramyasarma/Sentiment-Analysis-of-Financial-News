Investors may continue buying  gold 
amid concerns about the economic recovery and the prospects for
inflation, said  William White , chairman of the economic
development and review committee at the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.  White used to head the monetary and economics department at
the Bank for International Settlements. He spoke today at a
London Bullion Market Association conference in Berlin.  “Some kind of double dip seems to be more likely,” White
said. Still, “it is possible that the recovery will continue.”  “I think deflation is more likely,” though a period of
high inflation is possible, he said.  “In this environment of economic uncertainty, is there a
place for gold? In a world of tail events, whatever they may be,
the answer has to be yes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
