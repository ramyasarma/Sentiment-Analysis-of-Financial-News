German authorities are considering
extending curbs on bonuses at banks that received government aid
during the financial crisis, the Finance Ministry said today.  “The finance minister has said that he sees a disconnect
from reality there, and we will monitor this very attentively,”
ministry spokesman  Michael Offer  told reporters in Berlin.
Banker bonuses are “subject to further measures,” he said.  Germany in 2008 enacted caps on bonuses of 500,000 euros
($673,900) for executive-board members at institutions that
received government funds. A clause in the law governing the
Soffin bank-rescue fund obliges those banks to pay managers an
amount that’s “adequate” to their performance, he said.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel  faces pressure from lawmakers to
curb pay at banks such as  Hypo Real Estate Holding AG  and
Commerzbank AG that were rescued or aided by the state during
the financial crisis.  Leo Dautzenberg , finance spokesman for Merkel’s Christian
Democratic Union, wants the government to “intervene in valid
contracts” with employees of such banks, the Handelsblatt
newspaper reported today.  Hypo Real Estate made 25 million euros in one-time extra
payments for last year, spokesman  Walter Allwicher  said Sept.
18. Executives were excluded from the payments, which were in
lieu of bonuses, and employees’ total annual compensation didn’t
exceed 500,000 euros, Allwicher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
