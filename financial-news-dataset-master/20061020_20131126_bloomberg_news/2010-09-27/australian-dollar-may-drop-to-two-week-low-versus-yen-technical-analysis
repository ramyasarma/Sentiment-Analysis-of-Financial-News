The Australian dollar is poised to
drop to a two-week low against the yen, Gaitame.Com Research
Institute Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  A line connecting the lows reached on Sept. 8 and 14
appears to have capped the Australian dollar’s advance, said
 Takuya Kawabata , a researcher at the unit of Japan’s largest
foreign-exchange margin company in Tokyo. The so-called Aussie
dropped below the line on Sept. 23.  “This line is being breached gradually,” Kawabata said in
an interview with Bloomberg News yesterday. “As support turns
into resistance, I expect the currency to drop.”  Support refers to an area where buy orders may be clustered,
and resistance is an area where sell orders may be clustered.  Australia’s currency may fall to its 20-day moving average
at about 79 yen, Kawabata said. Should it drop below that level,
the currency may approach a line connecting the lows reached on
Aug. 25 and 31, he said. The line was at about 78.33 yen today.
Australia’s dollar last traded below that level on Sept. 15.  The Aussie was at 80.89 yen as of 7:53 a.m. in Tokyo from
81.00 in New York yesterday.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
