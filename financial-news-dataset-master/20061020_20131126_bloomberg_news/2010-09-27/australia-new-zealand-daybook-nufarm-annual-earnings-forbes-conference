---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks retreated, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index paring what could be its biggest September gain
in 71 years amid speculation merger talks between M&T Bank Corp.
and Banco Santander SA broke down, and investors bet Ireland and
Portugal’s finances are deteriorating.
*The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent to 1,142.16 as of 4 p.m. in New
York. The index has rallied 8.9 percent this month.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 48.22 points to 10,812.04.
*M&T dropped 7.1 percent after people familiar with the matter
said the bank ended talks with Santander.  London: European stocks declined for the fourth time in five
days amid speculation that this month’s rally may have overshot
the outlook for economic growth.
*The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.4 percent to
262.92 after earlier rising as much as 0.5 percent.  Tokyo: Asian stocks gained, driving the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
to a five-month high, as a bigger-than-estimated increase in U.S.
capital-goods orders bolstered optimism exports to the world’s
largest economy will rise.
*The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.2 percent to 127.04, the
highest level since April 27.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 1.6
percent to 4,675.30 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index increased 0.9 percent to 3,239.14 in
Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The euro fell from a five-month high against the
dollar as renewed signs of debt problems at European banks and
countries such as Ireland and Portugal reduced demand for assets
in the 16-nation region.
*The euro slid 0.2 percent to $1.3466 at 4:11 p.m. in New
York, from $1.3492 on Sept. 24. It touched $1.3507, the highest
level since April 10.
*The dollar traded at 84.22 yen, from 84.21 on Sept. 24.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries gained after the government’s $36 billion
auction of two-year notes drew the highest level of demand since
August 2007 as investors speculated the Federal Reserve will buy
more government bonds. *The 10-year note yield dropped 8 basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.53 percent at 4:36 p.m.
in New York.  METALS  New York: Copper prices fell from a five-month high on
speculation that tepid economic growth signals slack metal
demand. *Copper futures for December delivery fell 2.1 cents, or
0.6 percent, to settle at $3.597 a pound at 1:24 p.m. on the
Comex in New York.  OIL  New York: Crude oil futures were little changed as U.S. stocks
rebounded from an early decline and the dollar fluctuated
against the euro. *Crude for November delivery rose 3 cents to
settle at $76.52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  WHAT TO WATCH:
