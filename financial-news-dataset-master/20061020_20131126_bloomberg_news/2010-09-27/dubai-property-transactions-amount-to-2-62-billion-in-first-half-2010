Dubai real-estate transactions
totaled 9.63 billion dirhams ($2.62 billion) in the first six
months of the year, about half the amount for all of 2009,
according to government data.  Dubai’s Land Department recorded 1,188 sales in the first
half compared with a 2009 total of 2,327, the government said in
a bond prospectus published on the London Stock Exchange today.
The document didn’t provide figures for the first half of 2009.  The deepest global financial crisis since the 1930s led
Dubai property prices to slump more than 50 percent from their
peak in August 2008 as frozen credit markets force the country’s
largest mortgage providers, Tamweel PJSC and Amlak Finance PJSC,
to stop lending.  The sheikhdom’s property prices may drop another 20 percent
as 41,000 new homes are put on the market by the end of this
aggravate an existing glut, said  Ahmed Badr , a Dubai-based
analyst for Credit Suisse Group AG.  The value of property sales last year slumped 72 percent
from 2008 to 19.5 billion dirhams. The number of transactions in
2009 dropped to 2,327 from 5,916 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
