Cotton futures surged the exchange
limit in New York, extending a rally to a 15-year high, on
mounting concern that global demand will outstrip supplies.
Orange juice also rose.  Demand for cotton in China, the world’s largest grower and
consumer, topped domestic production by 3.6 million metric tons
in the year ended Aug. 31, widening a supply deficit, the China
Cotton Association, an industry group, said today. The price has
surged 65 percent in the past year.  “The story in cotton hasn’t changed,” said  Louis Barbera ,
a broker at VIP Commodities in New York. “There is still a big
supply problem. Demand hasn’t been rationed like people have
been thinking.”  Cotton for December delivery rose the exchange limit of 4
cents, or 4 percent, to settle at $1.0393 at 2:38 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the highest price for a most-active
contract since June 1995. The gain was the biggest since Feb. 9
and brought the fiber’s increase in the past two months to 36
percent.  The rally has been “quite orderly,” Barbera said. “I
don’t really see a stop to it.”  Global production will increase to 116.97 million bales,
falling short of demand of 119.16 million bales, Macquarie Group
Ltd. forecast last week. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  Mills overseas are still buying, Barbera said. “That’s
what drives the market higher.”  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 0.35 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to close at $1.5855 a pound at 2 p.m. in New
York. Earlier, the price dropped as much as 1.2 percent.  Futures have gained 13 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
