Glencore International AG, the
world’s biggest commodities trader, hired HSBC Holdings Plc,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc to help it sell
perpetual bonds denominated in dollars, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The sale, which will be benchmark in size, may be completed
as early as this week, the person said, asking not to be
identified as the details are private.  Glencore, which trades oil, metals and agricultural
commodities and controls mines and smelters on five continents,
said last month that first-half profit jumped 42 percent to
$1.56 billion on rebounding metals demand and prices. The
company agreed on a $10.2 billion line of credit in May, its
largest syndicated loan, and has $10.1 billion of bonds
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The perpetual notes can be redeemed by Glencore in October
2015, and proceeds will be used to redeem the company’s $700
million of 8 percent perpetual bonds on their first call date of
Feb. 6, 2011, the person said.  Those notes are trading at 99.75 cents on the dollar to
yield 8.021 percent, little changed from Sept. 24, BNP Paribas
SA prices on Bloomberg show.  Glencore will hold a telephone briefing with investors
later today, the person said. Benchmark typically means at least
$500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
