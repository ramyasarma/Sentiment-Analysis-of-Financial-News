Mexico’s peso fell the most in
three weeks as U.S. stocks declined and gang violence led to the
killing of the 11th mayor this year.  The peso weakened 0.3 percent to 12.5803 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, declining the most since Sept. 7, from
12.5397 on Sept. 24. The peso has risen 4.1 percent this year
against the dollar.  The S&P 500 Index fell 0.6 percent to 1,142.16 in New York
after gaining 2.1 percent last week. Attackers killed the
interim mayor of the southwestern town of Tancitaro today.  “Little by little the violence is becoming more
considerable,” said  Bertrand Delgado , an economist at Roubini
Global Economics LLC in New York.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.39 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.72 centavo to 133.62 centavos per peso.  State officials were conducting an autopsy to confirm the
cause of death after Gustavo Sanchez’s body was found on a road
in the Michoacan city of Uruapan, said an official at the state
attorney general’s office who declined to be identified in
accordance with agency policy. There were signs the victim may
have been killed with rocks, he said. The official didn’t say
whether there had been any arrests in the case or who may have
been responsible.  A proposal by the country’s largest opposition party to
reduce the value-added tax would send a “very confusing signal
to markets,” said former deputy finance minister  Alejandro Werner  in an interview today.  The peso would fall against dollar if the bill is approved,
he said. Mexico’s credit rating and credit default swaps would
also be at risk, he said.  Traders triggered $2 million of dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website. So far this month, $597
million in options have been exercised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
