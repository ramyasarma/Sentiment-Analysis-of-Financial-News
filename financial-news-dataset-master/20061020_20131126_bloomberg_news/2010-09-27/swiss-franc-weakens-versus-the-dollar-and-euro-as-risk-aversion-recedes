The Swiss franc weakened against
the dollar and euro as stocks rose, indicating greater appetite
for higher-yielding assets and lower demand for Switzerland’s
currency as a haven.  The franc snapped a six-day advance versus the dollar as
the  MSCI Asia Pacific  Index rose 1.3 percent and the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index  climbed 0.4 percent. The currency also fell
against the euro for the second day.  “Risk appetite is up slightly today,” said  Stephan Maier ,
a foreign-exchange strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan. “We
are seeing a partial comeback of the dollar.”  The franc depreciated 0.4 percent against the dollar to
98.66 centimes as of 8:50 a.m. in London, after reaching a
record 97.80 centimes on Friday. The currency also fell 0.1
percent to 1.3286 per euro.  Investors traditionally buy the franc during times of
economic turmoil because of the perceived stability of
Switzerland’s economy and its current account surplus, and
offload their holdings of the currency when they want to take on
more risk. It has climbed 4.1 percent this year against a basket
of currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
