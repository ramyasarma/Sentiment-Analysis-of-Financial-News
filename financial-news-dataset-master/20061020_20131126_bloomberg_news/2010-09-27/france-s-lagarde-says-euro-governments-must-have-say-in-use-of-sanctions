French Finance Minister Christine
Lagarde said governments shouldn’t be excluded from decisions on
whether to apply sanctions for countries that break euro-area
fiscal rules.  The decisions “shouldn’t be exclusively in the hands of
experts,” Lagarde told reporters in Brussels today. “The
political powers must remain in the game. We’re for strict
application of the criteria, but politicians mustn’t abdicate.
The politicians must have their say in the matter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
