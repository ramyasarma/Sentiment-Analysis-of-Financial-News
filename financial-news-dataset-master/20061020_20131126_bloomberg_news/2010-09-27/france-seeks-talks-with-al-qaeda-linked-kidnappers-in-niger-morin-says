France is ready to negotiate with
the al-Qaeda-linked group that holds seven hostages in the
Sahara desert, Defense Minister  Herve Morin  said.  “We are waiting for the demands of al-Qaeda in order to
discuss” the matter, Morin said in an interview today with
Canal-Plus television.  The hostages, five workers from Vinci SA’s Satom subsidiary
and one  Areva SA  employee and his wife, were kidnapped Sept. 16
in Arlit, near a uranium mine in northern Niger, the companies
have said. French officials say they think they’ve been moved to
somewhere in Mali. Five of the hostages are French, one is
Togolese, and one Madagascan.  Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, a terror group that operates in
the southern Sahara desert, has issued two statements claiming
the kidnapping.  France has sent two reconnaissance aircraft to Niger to
help locate the hostages.  “As in all hostage cases, negotiations are complex, they
are difficult, they are uncertain,” Morin said. “I am not more
optimistic than yesterday, but I’m not more pessimistic
either.”  Agence France-Presse reported over the weekend that an
unnamed Malian said he’d seen the hostages, and that they are
alive.  The group killed a 78-year old French hostage in July after
French and Mauritanian soldiers attacked an AQIM base in Mali.
Morin said that in that case, AQIM never entered into
negotiations over his release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
