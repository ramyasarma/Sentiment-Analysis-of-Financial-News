Aldar Properties PJSC, Abu Dhabi’s
biggest property developer, is studying acquisitions or joint
ventures with district cooling companies, threatening the
monopoly of its current provider National Central Cooling Co.,
also known as Tabreed.  “For the current commitments we have, we will continue to
use Tabreed,” head of infrastructure Faisal al-Kamali told
reporters in Abu Dhabi today. “For new projects, we will see
who provides the best services, as we don’t want customers to
run away from us” because of high cooling costs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
