Avenue Capital Group, the hedge
fund-firm run by  Marc Lasry , is in talks to hire members of
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ’s proprietary-trading business in the
U.S., according to two people briefed on the discussions.  Lasry is pursuing the Goldman Sachs team run by  Bob Howard 
to expand New York-based Avenue Capital beyond its focus on
distressed and credit investing, said the people, who asked not
to be named because the talks are private. KKR & Co., the New
York-based buyout firm, and investment bank Perella Weinberg
Partners LP also are negotiating with the group, people with
knowledge of the matter said Sept. 8.  Goldman Sachs is disbanding the principal-strategies
business to comply with new U.S. rules aimed at curbing risk.
The unit uses multiple strategies to make bets with the New
York-based firm’s own money.  Lasry declined to comment, as did  Ed Canaday , a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs.  Avenue Capital was started in 1995 and managed $18.8
billion at the end of July, according to its website.  The Goldman Sachs group is led globally by Hong Kong-based
 Morgan Sze , who may start his own hedge fund focused on Asia,
two people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Sze in March replaced  Pierre-Henri Flamand , the former global
head who left to set up a London-based hedge fund called Edoma
Capital Partners LLP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
