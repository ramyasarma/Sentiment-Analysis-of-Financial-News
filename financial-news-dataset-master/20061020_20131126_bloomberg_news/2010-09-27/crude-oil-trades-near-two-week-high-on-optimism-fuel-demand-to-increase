Oil rose for a fourth day in New
York as Asian equities climbed on signs of renewed equipment
purchases by factories and businesses, boosting traders’
expectations of increases in fuel demand.  U.S.  durable goods orders , not including volatile
transportation items, increased a more-than-expected 2 percent
in August. Capital equipment purchases rebounded 4.1 percent
after falling in July, the Commerce Department said Sept. 24.  “The durable goods orders reflect a bit more of a buoyant
manufacturing sector and that’s been a pivot point for the
economy over the last six to 12 months,” said  David Taylor , an
analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.  Crude for November delivery was at $76.74 a barrel, up 29
cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:15 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract earlier climbed as much as 36 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $76.85, the highest since Sept. 14.  Oil rose $1.31, or 1.7 percent, to $76.49 a barrel on Sept.
24 as the dollar fell to its lowest level against the euro since
April 20, boosting the appeal of commodities for investors.  Brent crude oil for November settlement climbed as much as
28 cents to $79.15 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, and was at $78.98. The contract gained 76 cents, or 1
percent, to end the session at $78.87 on Sept. 24.  The price difference between Brent and West Texas futures
in New York for November has narrowed to $2.24 a barrel today
from $3.45 a week earlier.  Equities Climb  Asian stocks gained, driving the MSCI Asia Pacific Index to
a five-month high, as a bigger-than-estimated increase in U.S.
capital-goods orders bolstered optimism exports to the world’s
largest economy will rise.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.1 percent to 126.83,
set to close at the highest level since April 27.  Hedge funds and other market speculators reduced their bets
that crude oil prices would climb. The net-long  positions  held
by money managers declined by 16,286 contracts, or 13 percent,
to 106,323 for the week ended Sept. 21, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report.  Hedge funds also increased bets to the highest level in six
weeks that diesel prices will climb as U.S. exports to Europe
doubled for the industrial and transportation fuel. Bullish
wagers on heating oil, a proxy for diesel, climbed by 58 percent
in the week ended Sept. 21, the CFTC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
