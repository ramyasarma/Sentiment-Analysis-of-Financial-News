The German government is “watching
closely” bonus payments by banks that have availed themselves
of government aid to managers below the executive board level,
Finance Ministry spokesman Michael Offer said.  While the government is considering “further measures” on
bonus payments in the future, current law doesn’t permit
limiting bonus payments to managers, he told reporters in Berlin
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
