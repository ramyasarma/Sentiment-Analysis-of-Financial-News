Woodside Petroleum Ltd.  hired
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. to help arrange a $1.1 billion syndicated
loan, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  Australia’s second-largest oil and gas producer is seeking
to refinance a facility of the same size signed in May 2009, the
person said, asking not to be identified as the plans are
private. The banks plan to start syndicating the five-year loan
in the coming weeks, according to the person.  Perth-based Woodside is developing the A$13 billion ($12.4
billion) Pluto project, one of more than a dozen proposed
liquefied natural gas developments in Australia targeting rising
Asian demand for cleaner-burning fuel. That demand may make
Australia the “Qatar of the Pacific” in the next decade,
research firm Sanford C. Bernstein said in July.  Woodside said that month that sales rose 48 percent in the
second quarter. A decision to expand the Pluto project depends
on the results of a drilling campaign or talks with other gas
suppliers, it said.  The company has about $4.9 billion of  debt , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
