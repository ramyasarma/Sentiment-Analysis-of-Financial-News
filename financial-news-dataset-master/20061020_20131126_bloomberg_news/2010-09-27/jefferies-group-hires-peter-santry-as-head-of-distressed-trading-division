Jefferies Group Inc. , the
securities firm that added 30 percent more staff in 20 months,
hired  Peter T. Santry  for the new position of head of distressed
trading in its leveraged-finance sales and trading division.  Santry spent 14 years at Banc of America Securities, a unit
of  Bank of America Corp ., where he was a managing director and
head of global special situations, Jefferies said today in a
statement. He was most recently head of leveraged products at
Chapdelaine & Co.  Santry, who also was named a managing director, “will
provide an increased focus on this integral part of our sales
and trading platform,”  Robert L. Harteveldt , global head of
leveraged finance for the New York-based firm, said in the
statement.  Jefferies has increased staff to pick up capacity from
failed investment banks and profit from a recovery in the
financial-services industry. The company may slow its hiring if
market conditions don’t improve, Chief Executive Officer  Rich Handler , 49, told analysts after the company reported Sept. 22
that third-quarter net income declined 46 percent. Trading
revenue slid 51 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
