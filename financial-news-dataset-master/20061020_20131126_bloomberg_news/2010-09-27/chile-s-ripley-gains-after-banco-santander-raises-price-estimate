Ripley Corp. SA , Chile’s third-
largest retailer by market value, rose the most in five weeks
after Banco Santander SA increased its year-end 2011 target
price and maintained a “buy” rating, citing benefits of the
company’s internal restructuring process.  Ripley rose 3.4 percent to 675 pesos at 3:58 p.m. New York
time, the largest increase since Aug. 23. The  IPSA index  gained
1 percent to 4,774.91.  Banco Santander expects Ripley to rise to 850 pesos by the
end of 2011. This compares with a previous estimate of 670
pesos.  “The very positive scenario for consumption in Chile and
Peru, and the benefits of the restructuring process, should
allow Ripley to post the largest increase in results in our
Chilean retail coverage, with a compounded annual growth rate of
96 percent between 2009 and 2012,” analysts  Carmen Concha  and
 Joaquin Ley  wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  Ripley began a restructuring of its operations in 2009,
which has allowed it to increase margins in its retail and
credit card businesses as well as decrease expenses over sales,
the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
