Lebanon’s budget deficit
narrowed to 2.33 trillion Lebanese pounds ($1.55 billion) in the
first eight months of this year as the government spent less on
subsidizing its main electricity generating company.  The deficit shrank from 2.77 trillion pounds in the
same period last year, the Ministry of Finance said in an
e-mailed report.  The government spent 586.6 billion pounds less on
subsidies for Electricite du Liban, which provides more
than 90 percent of the country’s electricity, the ministry
said.  Lebanon had a budget deficit of 4.46 trillion pounds
last year and a 4.4 trillion-pound shortfall in 2008,
averaging about 9.7 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
