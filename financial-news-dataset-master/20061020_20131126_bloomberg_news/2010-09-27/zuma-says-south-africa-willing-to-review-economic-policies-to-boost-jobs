South Africa’s government is
willing to review all economic policies, including inflation-
targeting and measures to manage the exchange rate, as it looks
to reduce poverty and inequality, President  Jacob Zuma  said.  “There are no holy cows,” Zuma said in a televised
interview with the  South African Broadcasting Corp.  late
yesterday.  Zuma pledged in his election campaign last year to do more
to create  jobs  for the one in four people without work in the
country. Labor union allies are pushing the ruling  African
National Congress  to increase state control of the  economy  and
scrap the central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent inflation
target, which they say has prevented a sharper drop in interest
rates.  Zuma made the comments at the end of a five-day meeting of
National General Council of the ANC, where the party agreed to
study the possible nationalization of mines. The Cabinet is also
considering a new growth plan aimed at boosting economic
expansion and creating more jobs, Zuma said.  There should be more “balance” on the exchange rate,
though there is no consensus on what an appropriate level of the
rand should be, Zuma said.  The rand has surged 34 percent against the dollar since the
beginning of 2009. The ANC meeting last week failed to agree on
a method to weaken the currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
