Zhu Baoliang, chief economist for
the State Information Center, said China can consider raising
its annual target for inflation to 5 percent in the period from
2011 through 2015 from this year’s 3 percent goal, the 21st
Century Business Herald reported.  China’s annual economic growth during the five year period
from 2011 through 2015 may be as low as 8 percent, the newspaper
cited Zhu as saying. The State Information Center is a research
organization under the National Development and Reform
Commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
