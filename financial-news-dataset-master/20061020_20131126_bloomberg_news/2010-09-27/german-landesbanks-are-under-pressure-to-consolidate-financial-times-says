Germany’s Deputy Finance Minister
 Steffen Kampeter  said it may take until next spring for the
publicly owned Landesbanks to agree to the initial steps of a
reorganization, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview.  Kampeter said consolidation is necessary to regain
confidence of the markets in the wake of the global financial
meltdown and the euro region crisis, the FT said.  He said that while he didn’t expect “anything definitive”
this year, “the contours” of change will be seen by the spring
of 2011, the newspaper said.  Kampeter and  Joerg Asmussen , another deputy finance
minister, are playing hosts to a meeting in Berlin today of the
Landesbanks and their owners -- the country’s state governments
and municipal savings banks, the FT said.  While the previous federal government didn’t push forward
consolidation in 2008, Kampeter said some of the seven banks
were under increased pressure and that “doing nothing” is no
longer an option, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
