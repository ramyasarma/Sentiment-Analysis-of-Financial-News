Gold rose for a fourth day in New
York and climbed to a record in London as prospects for
declining currency values may boost demand for precious metals.
Silver extended gains to the highest price since 1980.  The euro fell against 15 counterparts ahead of this week’s
disclosure of Ireland’s costs to bail out Anglo Irish Bank Corp.
and speculation other European banks lack adequate capital.
Central banks and the International Monetary Fund sold the least
gold since an agreement began in 1999, according to data from
the World Gold Council.  “Asian central banks are taking up the metal, and that’s
certainly buoyed investor sentiment,” said  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London. “There is a net
devaluing of currencies.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $2.80, or 0.2
percent, to $1,300.90 an ounce at 8:26 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Futures reached a record $1,301.60 on Sept. 24. Gold for
immediate delivery in London climbed to an all-time high of
$1,300.15.  Prices may advance to $1,406 an ounce in a year, the London
Bullion Market Association said today, according to the average
in a survey of those attending the London Bullion Market
Association’s conference in Berlin this week.  Silver futures climbed as much as 24.6 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $21.645 an ounce on the Comex, the highest price
since 1980. The December futures contract gained 19.1 cents, or
0.9 percent, at $21.59 an ounce most recently.  Some investors may prefer silver over gold because it is
cheaper, Moore said.  Bank Sales  Central-bank sales of gold decreased to 94.5 metric tons in
the year ended yesterday from 157 tons in the prior period,
according to figures on the council’s website. European central
banks have agreed to limit gold sales since 1999. India, Sri
Lanka and Bangladesh bought bullion from the IMF in the past
year.  Bullion is heading for a 10th consecutive annual advance,
the longest winning streak since at least 1920, spurring central
banks globally to add the metal to reserves. Combined central-
bank holdings rose in every quarter since the second quarter of
last year, data from the council show.  An ounce of gold bought as little as 60.07 ounces of silver
today, the least since October last year, according to Bloomberg
data. The lower the ratio, the more expensive silver is relative
to gold.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, decreased 0.91 ton on Sept. 24 as
holdings in the  iShares Silver Trust , the largest ETF for
silver, climbed 30.4 tons to a record, according to figures from
the funds’ websites.  Platinum for January delivery fell $1.90, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,643.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Palladium futures for December delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
$559.90 an ounce. Both metals will become more important
investments for pension funds,  Shayne McGuire , director of
global research at the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, said
at the LBMA conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
