Toronto is the world’s lowest risk
city for recruiting, employing and relocating employees,
according to  Aon Corp.’s  Aon Consulting unit.  New York, Singapore, London and Montreal also ranked in the
top five of Aon’s People Risk Index, which measures risks
companies face with recruitment, employment and relocation in 90
cities worldwide, Aon said today in a statement on its  website .
Dhaka, Bangladesh; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Lagos, Nigeria;
Karachi, Pakistan; and Tehran, were the least desirable for
employers.  Toronto and Montreal were among the lowest-risk cities
“primarily due to Canada’s low level of corruption; strict
enforcement of equal opportunity laws; health and retirement
benefits; and high quality and broad availability of training
facilities,” Aon said.  Toronto wasn’t No. 1 in any category even though it ranked
top overall, according to the report. Canada’s most populous
city ranked 14 in demographics and 12 in employment practices.  “Even the lowest risk cities are not perfect,” Rick
Payne, chief research officer, said. “The talent pool in
Toronto and Montreal is small compared to New York or Los
Angeles, which increases the risk of recruiting for certain
types of jobs.”  Aon, based in Chicago, is the world’s largest insurance
broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
