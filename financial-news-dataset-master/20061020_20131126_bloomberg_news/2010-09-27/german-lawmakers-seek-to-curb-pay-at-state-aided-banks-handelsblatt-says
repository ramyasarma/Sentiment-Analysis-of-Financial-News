German lawmakers are pressing the
government to curb pay at banks such as Hypo Real Estate Holding
AG that were rescued or aided by the state during the financial
crisis, Handelsblatt reported on its website today.
Lawmakers have asked the Finance Ministry to study how
regulators can “intervene in valid contracts” with employees
of such banks, the newspaper quoted Leo Dautzenberg, the finance
spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, as
saying in an interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
