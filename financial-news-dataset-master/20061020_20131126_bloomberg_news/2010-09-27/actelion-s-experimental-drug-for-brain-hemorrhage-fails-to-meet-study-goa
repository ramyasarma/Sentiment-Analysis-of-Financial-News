     Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) --  Actelion Ltd. , Switzerland’s
largest biotechnology company, said its clazosentan medicine
didn’t meet the main goal of a study in patients who had
suffered from bleeding in the brain.  The medicine was linked to a non-significant relative risk
reduction of 17 percent in people following aneurysmal
subarachnoid hemorrhage, the Allschwil-based company said in a
statement today. The future of another trial looking at the drug
in a similar use is still being discussed, Actelion said.  The company planned the Conscious-2 trial after an earlier
study found the drug cut the risk of vasospasm, a contraction of
blood vessels in the brain that occurs after a hemorrhage.
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs when the rupture of an
aneurysm -- a balloon-like bulge in an artery -- leads to the
release of blood into the brain. The condition affects more than
85,000 people a year in the U.S., EU and Japan, Actelion said.  “Actelion will continue to focus on growing its existing
businesses,” Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Paul Clozel  said in
the statement. “Actelion is generating the necessary revenues
to continue to invest appropriately in clinical studies for out
more than 10 development compounds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
