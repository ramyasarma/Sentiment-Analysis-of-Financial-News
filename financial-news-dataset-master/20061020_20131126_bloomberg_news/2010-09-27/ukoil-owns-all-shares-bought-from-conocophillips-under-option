OAO Lukoil , Russia’s largest non-
state oil producer, said it controls the 5 percent of its shares
bought back from ConocoPhillips for $2.4 billion in a
transaction announced yesterday.  Lukoil holds the 42.5 million shares purchased, a
spokesman, who declined to be identified according to company
policy, said by telephone today. The deal was arranged by
UniCredit Bank AG and covered less than half of the 11.6 percent
holding that ConocoPhillips made available at $56 a share under
an expired option.  “Lukoil’s management has bought just enough shares to
protect itself against a third-party investor accumulating the
ConocoPhillips shares and joining the company’s board,” Troika
Dialog, a Moscow-based broker, said in a research note.  ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, is reducing its stake in
Lukoil to raise money to repay debt and to repurchase its own
shares. Conoco still holds 56.2 million Lukoil shares and may
sell 5 million shares a month on the open market, potentially
weighing on the share price until August, Troika said.  Lukoil  shares  fell 2.2 percent to 1,760 rubles ($57.62) as
of 12:34 p.m. in Moscow.  The Russian oil producer in August also bought 7.6 percent
of its stock from Conoco for $3.44 billion. The company plans to
use the shares as a financial reserve,  Leonid Fedun , deputy
chief executive officer, said on Aug. 31.  Troika said that Lukoil will probably hold onto the stock
bought from Conoco, which totals 12.6 percent of the outstanding
shares, to use for acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
