Emirates District Cooling LLC , a
Dubai-based company, may offer shares in an initial public
offering by the end of 2011, Managing Director Adib Moubadder
said in Abu Dhabi today.  The company plans to list shares on the  Dubai Financial
Market , Moubadder said at the MEED Middle East District Cooling
Conference in Abu Dhabi. The IPO is the second planned share
sale in the United Arab Emirates in more than a year after  Axiom
Telecom LLC  was said to have a plan to sell shares in October.
The Axiom IPO would be the first in the U.A.E.  Middle-Eastern companies delayed share sales as regional
economies recovered from the impact of the worst global
recession since the Great Depression. The last IPO in the U.A.E.
was in March 2009 by  Green Crescent Insurance Co.,  an Abu Dhabi-
based provider of health insurance products.  Emicool is a joint venture between M’Sharie LLC, a
subsidiary of  Dubai Investments PJSC , and  Union Properties PJSC ,
a Dubai-based real estate developer. Union Properties retreated
0.5 percent to 42.6 fils, while Dubai Investments declined 1.6
percent to 94.2 fils.  -- With assistance from  Zahraa Alkhalisi  in Dubai. Editors:  Inal Ersan ,  Susan Lerner   To contact the reporters on this story:
