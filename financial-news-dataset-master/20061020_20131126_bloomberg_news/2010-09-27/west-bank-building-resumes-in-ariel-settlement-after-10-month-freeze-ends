Palestinian Authority President
 Mahmoud Abbas  said he will confer with Arab leaders next week
before reacting to Israel’s resumption of building at Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.  “We would have liked to see a moratorium that lasts
another three or four months, but we won’t have a rapid
reaction,” Abbas told reporters in Paris after meeting with
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy . “We will study all the
consequences with the Palestinian leadership and Arab
leadership.”  Abbas said he will meet with the Arab League on Oct. 4 and
afterward “we can clear up our position.”  Jewish settlers began building in several West Bank
settlements today, hours after a 10-month partial moratorium on
construction expired. Abbas had said earlier that he can’t
continue peace negotiations with Israel if settlement
construction continues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
