Fatmir Sejdiu , the president of
Kosovo, stepped down today after a local court ruled he
breached the constitution by also keeping a post in a political
party, Agence France Presse reported, citing Sejdiu.  Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is ethnic
Albanian, unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia
almost nine years after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
drove out the Serb army under leader  Slobodan Milosevic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
