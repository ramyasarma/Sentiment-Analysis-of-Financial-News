Stocks climbed, with the  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index  up to a five-month high, and the Korean won rose
as a rebound in U.S. capital goods orders boosted optimism the
global economy was recovering. Gold advanced to a record.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 1.2 percent to 127.06 at
4:03 p.m. in Tokyo, extending a four-week rally. The Stoxx
Europe 600 increased 0.2 percent to 264.45. Standard & Poor’s
500 Index futures were little changed. The euro weakened against
14 of 16 major counterparts and the Korea won added 0.6 percent
to 1,148.35 per dollar, reaching its strongest level in more
than four months. China’s yuan gained to its highest since 1993.  Investor optimism improved after U.S. bookings for goods
such as computers and communications gear climbed 4.1 percent in
August and as a government official said Japan was considering a
stimulus plan worth as much as 4.6 trillion yen ($54.6 billion).
Gains in Asian stocks as  Takefuji Corp. , Japan’s third-biggest
consumer lender, said it was studying ways to restructure.  “Rising capital investment in the U.S. is a positive sign
that shows companies expect demand to increase,” said  Ng Soo Nam , Singapore-based chief investment officer at Nikko Asset
Management Co., which has $123 billion in assets. “We have to
watch whether the improvements” are sustainable.  More than four stocks gained for every one that fell on the
 MSCI Asia Pacific Index  which is up 13 percent since June 30,
its best quarter since the period ended Sept. 30. Japan’s  Nikkei
225 Stock Average  was up 1.4 percent and Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index  gained 1.6 percent.  Komatsu, Canon  Komatsu Ltd. , the world’s second-biggest maker of
construction equipment, jumped 3.2 percent in Tokyo, while  Canon
Inc. , a camera maker that gets 28 percent of its sales in the
Americas, rose 2.5 percent. Japanese consumer lenders fell as
Takefuji said it was looking at ways to revitalize its business.
Shares dived 6.6 percent. The Markit iTraxx Japan index of
credit-default swaps rose 2 basis points to 101 in Tokyo,
according to Morgan Stanley.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company,
climbed 1.6 percent. Korea Zinc Co. jumped 5.5 percent to a
record in Seoul as gold and silver advanced. Mongolian Mining
Corp. raised the price range for its initial share sale in Hong
Kong, terms for the transaction show.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed to a record $1,300.15
an ounce as investors sought to protect their wealth, and traded
at $1,299.23. Silver advanced to $21.6075 an ounce, the highest
price since 1980, and traded at $21.5863 an ounce. Silver has
jumped 28 percent this year, outperforming global equities,
Treasuries and most industrial metals.  Euro, Won  The euro weakened against the dollar and yen as speculation
European banks will need more funds curbed demand for assets in
the 16-nation region. Ireland discloses the final expenses of
bailing out  Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  this week. The euro also
retreated from a eight-week high versus the yen after Der
Spiegel reported the European Commission is lacking confidence
in the viability of German regional lenders.  The euro dropped to $1.3473 in Tokyo from $1.3492 in New
York last week and declined to 113.49 yen from 113.62 yen. The
dollar was at 84.24 yen from 84.21 yen.  The South Korean won rose to its strongest level in more
than four months after signs of a recovery in the U.S., its
second-biggest export market. South Korea’s currency gained 5.8
percent in the past three months, the best performer among
Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies. The Taiwan dollar strengthened
0.8 percent to NT$31.42.  Yuan, U.S. Economy  “The U.S. data is looking better and along with stronger
Asian currencies, the won is also getting a lift,” said  Yun Se Min , a Seoul-based currency trader for Busan Bank. “We’re also
seeing exporters trying to repatriate income, which will
strengthen the won even more.”  China’s yuan climbed for a 10th straight day on speculation
the government will bow to political pressure to allow faster
appreciation. The yuan rose 0.1 percent to 6.7009 per dollar as
of 10:04 a.m. in Shanghai, from 6.7079 on Sept. 21, according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. The currency earlier
touched 6.6950, the strongest level since the central bank
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The U.S. national activity index declined to minus 0.5 in
August from zero in July, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Fed Bank of
Chicago releases the data today. A reading below zero indicates
below-trend-growth in the economy.  The Conference Board’s U.S. consumer confidence index fell
to 52.3 this month from 53.5 in August, according to another
survey before the New York-based research group’s data tomorrow.  To contact the reporters for this story:
