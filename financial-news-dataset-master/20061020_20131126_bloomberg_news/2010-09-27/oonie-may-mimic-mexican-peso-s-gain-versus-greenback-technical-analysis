Canada’s dollar may follow the
Mexican peso higher against the U.S. currency, approaching a
record set in 2007, according to Citigroup Inc.  The Canadian currency is headed toward 99.31 cents per U.S.
dollar, a level last reached on April 21,  Tom Fitzpatrick  and
 Alex Good  in New York and  Shyam Devani  in London, Citigroup
technical analysts, wrote in a note to clients today. It may
keep gaining to 90.59 cents as crude oil rises, they wrote. The
currency touched a record 90.58 cents on Nov. 7, 2007.  “We have had three tests of the C$1.1110 to C$1.0140 area
and held, but the fourth could be a charm,” the analysts wrote,
citing the three times the Canadian dollar appreciated to that
level versus the greenback without gaining further. Fitzpatrick
didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. Good and
Devani declined to comment.  Mexico’s currency broke below the U.S. dollar support level
and has gained 2.1 percent in the past five days, versus a 0.2
percent advance for the Canadian dollar. The loonie is poised to
catch up because crude oil may climb to $100 a barrel as weekly
averages “have converged to a point that suggests a strong
impulsive move may not be far away,” the analysts wrote. Crude
is Canada’s biggest export.  The Canadian dollar traded on a one-for-one basis with the
greenback on April 6 for the first time in almost two years. It
was down 0.4 percent today to C$1.0284 per U.S. dollar. Crude
oil for November delivery was at $75.56 a barrel in New York.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns to
forecast price changes. Support is a level on a chart where buy
orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
