IHS Automotive reduced its forecast
for U.S. car and truck sales this year to 11.3 million from 11.5
million.  Vehicle deliveries in the U.S. will rise to 12.8 million
next year as jobs and consumer confidence return, said Nigel
Griffiths, chief automotive economist with the Lexington,
Massachusetts-based firm. He spoke to reporters today at a
presentation in Northville, Michigan.  Sales last year fell to 10.4 million cars and trucks, the
fewest since 1982. Deliveries had averaged 16.8 million from
2000 to 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
