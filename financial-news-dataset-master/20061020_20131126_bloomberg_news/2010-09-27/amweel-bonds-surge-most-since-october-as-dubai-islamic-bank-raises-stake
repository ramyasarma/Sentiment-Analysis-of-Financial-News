Islamic bonds of  Tamweel PJSC  rose
the most in almost a year after Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC received
government approval to purchase a majority stake in the mortgage
lender hit by Dubai’s property slump.  The price on the 4.31 percent sukuk due in 2013 climbed to
83.5 cents on the dollar at 3:47 p.m. in Dubai, according to
Barclays Capital Group prices on Bloomberg. That is a 13 percent
increase, the biggest since Oct. 13, from the 73.7 cents close
on Sept. 24, according to Bloomberg prices.  “The new majority owner is of course welcome as a better
creditor, benefiting bondholders,” said  Tobias Bettkober , who
helps manage $400 million of convertible bonds at Holinger Asset
Management in Zurich.  Dubai Islamic, the biggest U.A.E. lender complying with
Shariah banking rules, will increase its stake in Tamweel to
57.33 percent from 21 percent, the Dubai government’s Media
Office said in a statement yesterday. Dubai Islamic bought the
stake from institutional investors, including the Dubai World
Group, it said without giving a value for the transaction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
