Qatar’s Pearl GTL
gas-to-liquid project will be fully operational in the first
quarter of 2012, Krey Stirland, commercial manager at Royal
Dutch Shell’s Qatari operations, said today in Doha.  Train 1 of the project will start up in the first quarter
of 2011 and will begin producing condensate and LPG. Pearl GTL
will begin producing naphtha, jet fuel, diesel and lubricants in
the second quarter, he told reporters at a conference.  Naphtha, jet fuel, diesel and lubricants from the project
will reach buyers by the third quarter of 2011, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
