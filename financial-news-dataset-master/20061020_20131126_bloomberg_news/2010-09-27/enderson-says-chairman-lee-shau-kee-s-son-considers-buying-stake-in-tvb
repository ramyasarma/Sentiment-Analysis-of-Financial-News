Henderson Land Development Co. Vice
Chairman Lee Ka-kit is studying a plan to buy a stake in
Television Broadcasts Ltd., Bonnie Ngan, a spokeswoman at the
developer, said by phone today.  The possible investment is unrelated to the company or
to unit Henderson Investment Ltd., Ngan said. Henderson Chairman
Lee Shau-kee hasn’t held talks with Shaw Brothers about the
stake in TVB, Ngan said. Lee Ka-kit’s interest in TVB is
preliminary and no agreement has been reached, she said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
