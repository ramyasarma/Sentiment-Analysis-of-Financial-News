             E.ON AG, Germany’s largest utility,
started sending supplies of natural gas to  Croatia  and Bosnia-Herzegovina as Russian deliveries of the fuel via Ukraine remain
halted.  
 E.ON Ruhrgas AG is supplying Bosnia-Herzegovina with 1
million cubic meters of the fuel daily as of today, while
Croatia will receive 500,000 cubic meters per day, according to
Kai Krischnak, a spokesman for the Essen-based E.ON gas unit.  
 Customers in Slovakia,  Hungary ,  Serbia  and  Italy  will
continue to receive up to 2.7 million cubic meters of natural
gas each per day, the spokesman said by phone today. E.ON hasn’t
set a limit on how long shipments can continue, he added.  
 Russian gas exporter OAO Gazprom is still sending E.ON 8
million cubic meters of gas per day over the Yamal
pipeline in northern  Germany , twice normal levels, according to
Krischnak.  
 E.ON Ruhrgas, which coordinates technical issues on the
European Union monitoring mission for Ukrainian pipelines,
doesn’t know when Russian gas supplies through that country will
resume, the spokesman said.  
 The company’s experts on site are still engaged in
“preparatory work,” he added, declining to say when they may
begin to monitor gas entering and exiting Ukraine.  
 No E.ON Ruhrgas client has suffered a disruption in supply,
according to Krischnak.
