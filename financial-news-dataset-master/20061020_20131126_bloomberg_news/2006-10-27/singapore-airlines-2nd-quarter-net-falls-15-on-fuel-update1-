             Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , the world's
second-largest carrier by market value, said profit fell for a
sixth quarter in seven, as higher fuel costs eroded gains from
increased  travel demand .  
 Net income dropped 15 percent to S$293 million ($187
million), or 23.9 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter
ended Sept. 30, the company said today. That compared with the
S$300 million median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Sales increased 7.7 percent to S$3.6 billion.  
 Chief Executive Officer Chew Choon Seng has been raising
surcharges and hedging fuel to cope with higher fuel costs, the
airline's single-biggest expense. As travel demand in the region
rises, the airline has been ordering new planes, including the
delay-plagued Airbus SAS A380.  
 ``The fuel prices are off around about 17 to 18 percent of
their highs in August but they are still by historical standards
very high and are a major challenge for the airlines,'' said
Derek Sadubin, the Sydney-based general manager of the Centre for
Asia Pacific Aviation. ``What the carriers can face for the next
twelve months is just relentless focus on cost reduction and
competition.''  
 Jet fuel traded in  Singapore  at an average of $85.84 a
barrel in the three months to September, almost 15 percent higher
than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg data. The price of
jet kerosene surged to a record $93 a barrel on Aug. 8.  
 Shares of the carrier rose 1.3 percent, to S$15.60 today
ahead of the earnings announcement. The stock climbed 15 percent
in the quarter, compared with the 8.1 percent advance in the
nine-member Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines index.  
 Fuel Surcharges  
 The carrier cut fuel surcharges on Oct. 13 by as much as 10
percent, citing lower  oil prices . The price of jet kerosene
closed at $73.35 today in Singapore, 21 percent lower than its
$93 peak in August. It fell 12 percent to $76.75 at the end of
September from $87.15 at the end of June.  
 Losses at airlines worldwide this year may be less than
expected as carriers sell more tickets and fuel prices drop,
according to the  International Air Transport Association . The
group, which represents about 260 network carriers, said the
industry may perform better than its $1.7 billion loss estimate.  
 Singapore Airlines said fiscal first-half profit rose 50
percent to S$868 million, spurred by an increase in travel demand
and one-time items including the sale of a building. That
compared with the S$875 million median estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Sales increased 10 percent to S$7.03
billion.  
 The airline booked a one-time gain of S$223 million from the
sale of a building in downtown Singapore in the first quarter.  
 The carrier, 57 percent owned by the Singapore government's
investment company Temasek Holdings Pte., said it's paying
shareholders a dividend of 15 cents compared with 10 cents a year
earlier.
