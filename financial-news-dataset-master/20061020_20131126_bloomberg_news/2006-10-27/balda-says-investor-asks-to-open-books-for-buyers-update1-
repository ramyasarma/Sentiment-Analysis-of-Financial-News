             Balda AG (BAF) , which cut its profit
forecast last month, said its largest shareholder asked to give
investors interested in buying the company access to its books.  
 Cycladic Capital LLP wrote a letter to the supervisory
board, claiming only access to the books would allow investors to
assess Balda's restructuring plans, the Bad Oeynhausen, Germany-based company said in a statement to OTS newswire today.  
 Audley Capital Advisors LLP is among the potential buyers of
the world's second-largest maker of plastic handset parts. The
London-based investment company run by Julian Treger may offer to
pay as much as 8 euros ($10.14) per share. The bid would include
a premium of 40 percent to 60 percent on the current stock price,
Balda said.  
 The company cut its 2006 pretax profit forecast to a loss of
as much as 50 million euros, from an earlier prediction of 20
million euros in profit. Balda said on Oct. 24 it to plans to
sell three German factories and cut its workforce in the country
by 63 percent after sales slumped.  
 Shares of Balda rose 0.2 percent to 5.06 euros in  Frankfurt ,
after gaining as much as 5 percent earlier.
