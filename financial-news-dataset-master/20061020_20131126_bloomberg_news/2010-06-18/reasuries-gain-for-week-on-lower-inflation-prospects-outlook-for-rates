             Treasuries gained for the week on
speculation subdued inflation will persuade the Federal Reserve
to keep the benchmark interest rate at a record low, supporting
demand for government securities.  
 Ten-year notes posted a five-day increase, even as they
fell today amid fluctuating stocks, after reports this week
showed unemployment claims rose, housing starts dropped and
consumer prices declined. The Treasury will sell $108 billion in
shorter-term notes next week, $5 billion less than last month.  
 “The Fed is on hold probably until the end of the year,”
said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at Bank of Nova
Scotia in New York. “The fear out there is that the economy
could be double-dipping in the second half.”  
 The 10-year yield fell 2 basis points this week, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.22 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data.  
 The benchmark note’s yield rose 3 basis points today, after
earlier falling to 3.18 percent, the  lowest  level since June 10.
The 3.5 percent security due May 2020 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102 11/32.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index was little changed after
falling 0.2 percent and gaining as much as 0.5 percent. It
gained 2.4 percent for the week.  
 ‘Deep Into 2011’  
 “The drumbeat of the Fed on hold deep into 2011 is
attracting more votes among investors,”  Jim Vogel , head of
agency-debt research at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee,
wrote in a note to clients. “More capitulated on the
combination low-inflation, slow-employment grind signals.”  
 The consumer price index declined 0.2 percent in May, the
biggest drop since December 2008, data from the Labor Department
showed yesterday. Initial claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly rose to 472,000 last week. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had forecast a decline to 450,000. Housing
starts fell 10 percent in May, the biggest decline since March
2009, Fed data showed on June 16.  
 The difference in yields between 10-year Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities, or  TIPS , and comparable
conventional bonds show money managers expect the consumer price
index to increase an average 2.02 percent a year in the next
decade, down from 2.41 percent at the end of 2009. The  gap 
touched 1.83 percent on May 21, the narrowest since Oct. 9.  
 Rate Outlook  
 The Fed is forecast to leave the benchmark rate for
overnight loans between banks at a record low when policy makers
meet June 22-23.  
 “In this environment, we don’t expect to hear anything out
of the Fed” about a change in the benchmark interest rate, said
 Richard Volpe , co-head of interest rates in Stamford,
Connecticut, at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, one of 18
primary dealers that trade with the U.S. central bank.  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange show a 75 percent
chance the Fed will maintain or cut interest rates by its
December meeting, up from 62 percent a month ago. Policy makers
lowered the benchmark  target rate  to a range of zero to 0.25
percent in December 2008 to reduce borrowing costs and help
stimulate the economy.  
 Ten-year notes rose this week amid speculation governments
are struggling to contain Europe’s debt crisis after Greece’s
credit rating was lowered to junk by Moody’s Investors Service.
 Yields  fell almost one percentage point between April 5 and May
25, when they reached 3.06 percent, the lowest since April 2009.  
 “Foreign and domestic investors continue to prefer
Treasuries over spread products,”  Michael Pond , an interest-
rate strategist in New York at primary dealer Barclays Plc,
wrote in a research report. “Ongoing turmoil in the euro area
has certainly helped.”  
 Spanish Bonds  
 The  securities  slipped today as stocks swung between gains
and losses after increased demand yesterday at a Spanish bond
sale eased concern Europe’s debt crisis would worsen.  
 Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond  fund  at
 Pacific Investment Management Co. , boosted holdings of U.S.
government-related debt to the highest level in six months.  
 The $227.9 billion  Total Return Fund ’s investment in the
debt was increased to 51 percent of assets in May, from 36
percent the previous month, according to the  website  of Newport
Beach, California-based Pimco.  
 Treasuries, part of the government-related category, are
the premier holdings for fixed-income investors, Gross, 66, said
this month.  
 U.S. securities are set for their best first half in a
decade as the world’s largest economy starts to rein in its
budget deficit and reduces the size of bond auctions.  
 The Treasury said yesterday it will auction $40 billion in
2-year notes, $38 billion in 5-year securities and $30 billion
in 7-year debt in three daily sales that begin June 22. That
compares with offerings of $42 billion, $40 billion and $31
billion of the notes last month. Next week’s total is the lowest
for sales of the three securities since June 2009.  
 Treasuries have returned 4.7 percent since Dec. 31, heading
for the largest gain in the first six months of a year since
2000, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.
