             Tauron Polska Energia SA, Poland’s
second-largest power group, has received orders for all the
shares on sale in its initial public offering, two people
familiar with the matter said.  
 The Polish government is likely to sell 52 percent of
Tauron at close to the top of the price range, said one of the
people, who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public. The shares are being offered at between 0.55 zloty
to 0.7 zloty apiece. At the top end, Poland will raise 5.2
billion zloty ($1.6 billion) in the nation’s third-largest IPO
since 2004.  
 UBS AG and UniCredit SpA are global coordinators of the
share sale. Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch, ING Groep NV,
BRE Bank SA, PKO Bank Polski SA, Bank Ochrony Srodowiska SA,
Bank Pekao SA and Trigon will also help manage the offering.  
 Treasury Ministry spokesman  Maciej Wewior  declined to
comment. The government will announce the results on June 22.
