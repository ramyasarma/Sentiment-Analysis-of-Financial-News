             Tenaga Nasional Bhd. , Malaysia’s
state-controlled power producer, forecasts electricity demand to
grow by as much as five percent this year as the country’s
economic recovery spurs manufacturing.  
 That’s higher than the utility’s earlier estimate of 3.5
percent for the current financial year ending August 31. “When
the economy recovers then demand will jump,” Chief Executive
Officer  Che Khalib Mohamad Noh  said in an interview yesterday.  
 Malaysia emerged from its first recession in a decade in
the final quarter of 2009 and posted a 10.1 percent jump in
gross domestic product in the three months ended March 31.
Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy aims to achieve an
average six percent annual economic growth from 2011 to 2015,
according to the government’s 10th Malaysia Plan released June
10.  
 Power demand may grow by as much as four to five percent
per annum for the next five years, Che Khalib said. “The
correlation between demand for electricity and GDP growth is
close to unity,” he said. “This is something we need to
constantly review.”  
 Malaysia’s central bank forecasts growth may rebound to as
much as 5.5 percent in 2010 as exports of goods such as Sime
Darby Bhd.’s palm oil and Unisem (M) Bhd.’s semiconductors
recover. The economy contracted 1.7 percent last year amid the
global slump.
