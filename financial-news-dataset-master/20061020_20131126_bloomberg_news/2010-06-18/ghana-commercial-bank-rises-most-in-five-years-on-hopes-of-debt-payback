             Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd.  rose the
most in five years on what a trader said were hopes that a
recent government bond sale would be used to pay debt owed to
the lender.  
 Ghana Commercial, the West African nation’s biggest lender
by branches, rose 13 pesewas, or 8.8 percent, to 1.6 cedis as of
11 a.m. in the capital, Accra, today. During the session it rose
22 pesewas, or 15 percent, the most since Feb. 25, 2005.  
 “More funds will be coming” to Ghana Commercial from the
proceeds of the bond sale, said Hilary Lomotey, a trader with
Renaissance Capital in Accra.  
 The Bank of Ghana said June 4 it sold 216.64 million cedis
($150.9 million) worth of three-year bonds. A similar sale in
March was used to clear debt the state-run Tema Oil Refinery
Ltd. owed to Ghana Commercial. More bonds would be sold to clear
the remaining 403 million cedis of debt, the Finance Ministry
said.
