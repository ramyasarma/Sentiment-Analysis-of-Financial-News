             China’s exports to Europe may have
already suffered from the European debt crisis, the China
Business News cited Wang Zhiping, director general of the China
Foreign Trade Centre.  
 May export growth to Europe was less than 20 percent, “far
less” than his organization’s expectations, Wang said,
according to the report.
