             HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s largest
bank, sold $3.4 billion of undated bonds in the biggest issue of
its kind for almost two years, re-opening a market that’s been
shut since December.  
 HSBC’s bonds, which have no maturity date and are callable
after 5 1/2 years, will pay a coupon of 8 percent, according to
a person with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be
identified because the details are private. That’s at the lower
end of the marketing range of 8 percent to 8.125 percent.  
 The deal is the biggest U.S. dollar-denominated perpetual
note since  Credit Suisse Group AG  issued $3.5 billion of 11
percent securities in October 2008, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The last bank to sell perpetual bonds was Paris-
based lender BNP Paribas SA in December 2009.  
 “This shows the market is open for high-quality issuers
but even they are going to have to pay up,” said  Tim Condon ,
chief Asia economist at ING Groep NV in Singapore. “In this
environment the closer you are to a really creditworthy
government bond, the better.”  
 HSBC is  rated  Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, the third-
highest grade, and one level lower at AA- by Standard & Poor’s.  
 No bank has sold a perpetual bond in dollars with a coupon
lower than 7 percent since March 2009, Bloomberg data show. The
highest coupon paid by a dollar perpetual note that’s currently
outstanding is the 14.95 percent interest of Mizuho Financial
Group Inc.’s $850 million of bonds sold in February 2009.  
 Capital Requirements  
 Perpetual bonds are typically sold by banks, which
generally retain the right to call them after five years. They
rank as Tier 1 capital and help lenders fulfil their capital
requirements.  
 HSBC’s sale was the first dollar perpetual bond issue this
year, compared with more than $8.3 billion in the same period of
2009, Bloomberg data show. Banks including Zions Bancorporation
have sold dollar perpetual preferred stock since January, which
is stock with no fixed maturity date.  
 The issue from London-based HSBC followed conventional bond
sales from banks including  Bank of America Corp.  and JPMorgan
Chase & Co., the two largest U.S. banks by assets. Bank of
America’s $3 billion offering was its first benchmark issue of
dollar-denominated 10-year notes in a year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based  JPMorgan  boosted its sale
by 25 percent to $1.25 billion.  
 Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s biggest bank, issued 1 billion
euros of so-called lower Tier 2 bonds that were priced to yield
210 basis points, or 2.1 percentage points, over swaps
yesterday,
according to a banker involved in the deal.  
 Bond Sales Rise  
 Bank bond sales are increasing. Lenders sold $38 billion of
bonds this month globally, more than double the $14.4 billion
issued in the same period of May, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 “In the last 24 hours, we’ve seen banks in the U.S. and
Europe issue over $8 billion of securities, spanning senior,
lower Tier two and preferred,” said  Krishna Hegde , Asia credit
strategist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. “These large
transactions with broad-based investor participation are likely
to have a positive spillover.”  
 Funds from the sale will be used “in the ordinary course
of business,” Hong Kong-based HSBC spokeswoman  Vinh Tran  said.
“This was an issue targeted at U.S. investors and part of our
capital planning.”  
 Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley, UBS AG and Wells Fargo &
Co. helped HSBC to manage its sale, which was reported earlier
today by the International Financing Review. The notes are
expected to be rated A3, the fourth-lowest investment-grade, by
Moody’s Investors Service.
