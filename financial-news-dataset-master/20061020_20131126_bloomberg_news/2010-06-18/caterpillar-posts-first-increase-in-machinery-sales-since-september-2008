             Caterpillar Inc. , the world’s
largest maker of construction equipment, said worldwide retail
sales of excavators, bulldozers and mining trucks measured over
three months rose for the first time in almost two years.  
 Sales for Caterpillar’s machinery division as reported by
dealers were 11 percent higher in the period through May, the
company said in a regulatory filing today. The previous gain was
posted in September 2008, said  Jim Dugan , a spokesman for
Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar. North American sales rose 15
percent in the period, the first improvement since August 2006.  
 Caterpillar reports three-month retail sales on a rolling,
monthly basis and compares them with the same period a year
earlier.  
 Sales are rising as the U.S. economy recovers and mining
companies invest in new equipment. Caterpillar said yesterday it
would invest $700 million to produce a range of mining shovels
and boost truck production in the U.S. and India.  
 “We continue to see improving trends around the world,”
said  Jeff Windau , an analyst for Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis
who has a “buy”  recommendation  on the stock. “There is a lot
of strength in the machine side.”  
 Machine retail sales in Asia rose 38 percent, the company
said. Engine sales in the marine and petroleum business
segments, down 27 percent and 20 percent respectively, continue
to be a drag, Windau said.  
 Caterpillar  rose 90 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $65.85 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have gained 16 percent this year.
