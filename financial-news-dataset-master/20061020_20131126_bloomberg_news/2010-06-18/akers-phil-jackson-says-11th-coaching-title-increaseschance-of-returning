             Phil Jackson  said the Los Angeles
Lakers helped their chances of bringing him back as coach next
season with a title win over the Boston Celtics.  
 Jackson, who made $12 million for the season that ended
last night with the 83-79 home victory in Game 7 of the National
Basketball Association Finals, isn’t under contract for 2010-11.
The 64-year-old coach’s return has been a question all season,
with team owner  Jerry Buss  wanting him to take a pay cut and
Jackson, who extended his coaching championship record to 11,
considering retirement.  
 “It does improve my chances,” Jackson said last night at
a news conference when asked if the title improved the odds of
his returning next season if asked back.  
 “I’ve got to take a deep breath,” Jackson said during the
trophy presentation. “I’ve got to take some time and think
about this. This was great. I’ll wait to make that decision in a
week.”  
 There are 3-to-1 odds that Jackson retires, according to
online gambling website  BetUs.com , meaning a $100 bet would
return $300 in profit and the original wager if he calls it a
career. The odds on Jackson returning to Los Angeles are 1-to-3.
Only two teams, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles
Clippers, have coaching vacancies. The Cavaliers’ odds of
landing Jackson are 8-1 and the Clippers’ 10-1.  
 Jackson, whose girlfriend, Jeanie Buss, is a Lakers
executive and Jerry Buss’s daughter, said in May that a salary
cut by the owner had been “indicated.” He declined to discuss
specifics.  
 Three in Row  
 If Jackson does return to the Lakers next season, he’ll be
trying to win a title in three straight campaigns for the fourth
time in his  19-year career .  
 As coach of the Chicago Bulls from 1989 through 1998, the
team led by  Michael Jordan  and  Scottie Pippen  twice managed
three-year title streaks. Jackson joined the Lakers in 1999 and
won titles from 2000 through 2002 behind  Shaquille O’Neal  and
 Kobe Bryant .  
 Last night’s victory marked another Lakers’ repeat, having
knocked off the Orlando Magic a season ago. Bryant last night
was named the Most Valuable Player of the NBA Finals for the
second straight year. He said while accepting the honor that he
wants Jackson to return.  
 “He knows how bad I want him back,” Bryant said. “I’ve
told him that. I’ve been openly blunt about that and told him
how much I want him back. Let’s go for it again. Let’s go for it
again.”
