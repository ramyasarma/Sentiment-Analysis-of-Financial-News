             The franc climbed to a record
against the euro a day after the Swiss central bank softened its
stance on limiting the currency’s gains as the threat of
deflation faded.  
 The Swiss National Bank, which has been buying foreign
currencies since March 2009 to counter the threat of deflation,
said yesterday the risk has “largely disappeared.” It also
held the  three-month Libor  target rate at 0.25 percent while
saying it can’t keep interest rates at a record low in the
medium term without fueling inflation.  
 The franc strengthened as much as 0.9 percent to 1.3730 per
euro, the strongest level since the shared currency’s 1999
debut, before trading at 1.3745 at 11:39 a.m. in London,
compared with 1.3776 yesterday. The franc has gained 7.9 percent
against the euro this year.  
 The SNB raised its 2010 growth forecast to 2 percent from
about 1.5 percent in March. The central bank, which aims to keep
 inflation  below 2 percent, sees consumer-price growth averaging
2.2 percent in 2012 and accelerating to 3.1 percent in early
2013, based on the benchmark rate remaining at 0.25 percent.  
 “The current expansionary monetary policy cannot be
maintained over the entire forecast horizon without
compromising” price stability, SNB Chairman  Philipp Hildebrand 
said. SNB Vice Chairman  Thomas Jordan  said Swiss banks “must be
prepared for interest rates to rise.”
