             World Cup matches will be
categorized according to their risk of being the subject of
match fixing, FIFA Director of Legal Affairs Marco Viliger said.  
 Games that will be placed in the highest risk category will
be so-called dead rubbers in the final round of the group stage,
where neither team has anything left to play for, Viliger told
an invited group of reporters in Johannesburg today.  
 Soccer’s governing body is working with betting companies,
Interpol and other bodies to create an early warning system for
what Viliger described as “the biggest threat to the game.”  
 None of the 20 matches played so far at the tournament have
been investigated for suspicious activity, Viliger added.  
 A dedicated telephone hotline for players and match
officials to report approaches from match fixers hasn’t received
any calls, he said.
