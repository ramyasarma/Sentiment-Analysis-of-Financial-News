             Guinea’s army said it will hand over
anyone suspected of involvement in a massacre by the country’s
security forces of opposition supporters in September.  
 Suspects “will not be protected because we are going to
deliver them,” Colonel Nouhou Thiam, the army’s chief of staff,
said on state-owned  Radio Television Guineenne  yesterday.  
 Government troops massacred more than 150 protestors and
injured 1,000 people calling for free and fair elections on
Sept. 28 in a stadium in Conakry, the capital. A United Nations
panel has concluded the killings were “crimes against humanity.”
The U.S. State Department has called for the perpetrators of the
massacre to be “held to account.”  
 Guinea, which has been ruled by a military junta since
December 2008, holds elections on June 27. The West African
nation is the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, a raw
material used in the production of aluminum.
