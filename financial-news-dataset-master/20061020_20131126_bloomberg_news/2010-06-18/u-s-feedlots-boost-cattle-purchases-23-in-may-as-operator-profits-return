             U.S. feedlot purchases of young
cattle surged 23 percent in May from a year earlier, as profits
grew and pasture conditions improved.  
 Feedlots  bought 2.022 million head of cattle last month, up
from 1.638 million in May 2009, when placements were the lowest
for the month since 1996, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said today in a report. The estimate matches the average
forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Purchases
were 2.9 percent larger the average for the previous five years.  
 Feedlots without risk-management plans made money for a
fourth straight month in May, bringing in about $90 on each
animal sold for slaughter, compared with a loss of $55 in May
2009, said  Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the University of
Missouri in Columbia.  Spot-market steer  prices averaged about 15
percent higher in May than a year earlier, as beef demand
recovered from the recession.  
 “Some guys had some good risk management done, had cattle
hedged at higher prices, and so feedlot profitability came
back,” said  Troy Vetterkind , the owner of Vetterkind Cattle
Brokerage in Chicago. The surge in feedlot purchases is “a
reflection of last May’s placements being historically low.”  
 The overall feedlot herd on June 1 totaled 10.494 million
head, down 0.8 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected a 0.7 percent increase.  
 Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds and fatten them on corn
until they weigh about 1,200 pounds and are sold to meatpackers.  
 Improved Pastures  
 Wetter weather this year improved pasture conditions,
allowing more cattle to graze through March and April before
being sold to feedlots in May, said Tim Petry, a livestock
economist at North Dakota State University in Fargo.  
 Drought last year in the southern Great Plains spurred
farmers to sell cattle grazing on wheat grass earlier than usual
to feedlots, leaving fewer to be marketed in May, Petry said.  
 Producers sold about 1.869 million head of cattle to
meatpackers in May, down 4.3 percent from a year earlier and the
lowest for the month since at least 1996, according to the USDA
report. Analysts had expected a 3.2 percent drop.  
 Slaughter-ready cattle futures for August delivery fell
0.425 cent, or 0.5 percent, to 88.2 cents a pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Prices have gained 8 percent in the past
year. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement increased
0.025 cent to $1.10175 a pound.
