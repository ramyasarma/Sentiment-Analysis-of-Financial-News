             Wheat rose to the highest in a month
on speculation that the condition of the U.S. winter crop
declined in the past week because of excessive rain in the
southern Great Plains and Midwest.  
 Six times the normal precipitation fell in parts of Kansas,
Oklahoma and Texas in the past seven days, National Weather
Service  data  show. The rain flooded fields and damaged plants in
parts of Oklahoma, the state’s wheat commission said this week.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its weekly  crop
progress report  on June 21.  
 “Some people I’ve talked to in Chicago are concerned about
crop degradation,” said  Mike Zuzolo , president of Global
Commodity Analytics in Lafayette, Indiana. “I would be looking
for that in crop conditions on Monday.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 4.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $4.83 a bushel at 11:04 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has gained 13 percent since June 9, the last
time the most-active contract settled lower. Futures earlier
touched $4.8475 a bushel, the highest since May 13.
