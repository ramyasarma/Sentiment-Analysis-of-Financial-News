             Delta Air Lines Inc. , the world’s
biggest carrier, will hire 700 airport ticket and gate agents to
help handle increased summer traffic and operations disrupted by
weather.  
 The additions are on top of 300 pilot and 300 reservation
agent jobs recently filled by the Atlanta-based airline,  Chris Kelly , a Delta spokeswoman, said today in an interview. The 700
airport agents will be hired nationwide, primarily at about 20
of Delta’s largest airport, Kelly said.  
 “With an airline the size and scope of ours, there is an
irregular operation somewhere in the system almost daily,”
Kelly said. “We want to get better at treating those like a
regular operation and doing all we can for our customers when
they do happen.”  
 Delta  employees  will be able to apply for the open
positions and part-time workers can seek full-time status before
the company takes applications from outside the airline, she
said. Hiring for the airport jobs will begin “in the next
several weeks,” Kelly said.  
 Delta, which has more than 70,000 employees,  fell  48 cents
to $13.71 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 20 percent this year.
