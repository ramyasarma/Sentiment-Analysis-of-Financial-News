             A U.K. court has found  Total SA  and
Chevron Corp. guilty of failing to prevent the Buncefield fire
in a fuel depot in north London in 2005, according to the Health
and Safety Executive.  
 “When the largest fire in peacetime Europe tore through
the Buncefield site on that Sunday morning in December 2005,
these companies had failed to protect workers, members of the
public and the environment,” the HSE said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd., operator of the depot, is a
venture between Paris-based Total, which holds 60 percent in the
company, and San Ramon, Californa-based Chevron.  
 “We understand the decision made by the jury,” Claire
Elliot, a U.K.-based Total spokeswoman, said by phone. “We
deeply regret the events at Buncefield and would like to
apologize to all those affected by the incident.”  
 British Pipeline Agency Ltd. and TAV Engineering Ltd. were
among companies that were also found guilty or pleaded guilty to
various charges related to the fire.  
 The  Buncefield  oil depot is about 25 miles north of London
and supplies jet fuel by pipeline to Heathrow, Europe’s busiest
airport.
