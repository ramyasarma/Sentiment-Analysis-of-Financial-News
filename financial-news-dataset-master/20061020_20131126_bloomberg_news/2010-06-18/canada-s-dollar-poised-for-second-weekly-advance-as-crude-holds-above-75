             Canada’s dollar had its first back-
to-back weekly gains since April as rising oil prices and
falling risk aversion enhanced the appeal of currencies from
countries that rely on commodities for growth.  
 The Canadian currency rose to a one-month high today,
extending its five-day advance to 1.1 percent as investors
warmed to risk assets and speculated the nation’s central bank
will raise interest rates faster than other countries.  
 “The stronger performance over the week is partly on the
return of risk appetite and, more importantly, oil rallying
again and remaining above $75 a barrel,” said  Matthew Strauss ,
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto.  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.7 percent to
C$1.0211 per U.S. dollar at 4:18 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0282
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 97.95 U.S. cents.  
 Three times this week the currency stalled at C$1.0225
before appreciating today to C$1.0207, the strongest level since
May 14.  
 Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, rose as much
as 0.9 percent to $77.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange before trading at $77.35, extending
its weekly rally to 4.8 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  advanced 0.2 percent on the day and had a 2.4 percent
weekly increase.  
 Correlation to Dow  
 The Canadian dollar is 92 percent correlated to the Dow,
the tightest relationship since at least March 1991, when
Bloomberg started tracking the data. The correlation with crude
oil is 67 percent, down from the record high 83 percent in
December. A correlation of 100 percent would mean the
instruments move in lockstep.  
 Government bonds dropped today, pushing the two-year  yield 
up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.73 percent.
The price of the 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2012 fell
4 cents to C$99.56. The yield still dropped five basis points
this week.  
 Foreigners bought a net C$12.4 billion ($12 billion) of
Canadian securities in April, led by purchases of government
bonds in the secondary market, Statistics Canada said today.  
 They invested C$9.99 billion in bonds, led by the purchase
of C$6.2 billion of outstanding federal government debt. Non-
residents also bought C$2.81 billion of stocks, while divesting
C$436 million of money-market paper.  
 Economists predicted a C$2.5 billion net purchase of
Canadian securities, according to the median of five estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Carney on Rates  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  reiterated today future
interest-rate moves aren’t “preordained” because of an uneven
global recovery.  
 “The bank must balance the competing influences on
Canadian activity and inflation of momentum in domestic demand
and the increasingly uneven global recovery,” Carney said today
in the text of a  speech  in St. John’s, Newfoundland.  
 The Bank of Canada became on June 1 the first central bank
in the Group of Seven nations to raise interest rates since July
2008, increasing its target lending rate from a record low by a
quarter-percentage point to 0.5 percent.  
 Canada’s index of  leading economic indicators  increased 0.9
percent in May in a 12th straight advance, led by gains in new
orders for manufacturers, Statistics Canada also said today. The
median forecast of 13 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an increase of 0.7 percent.
