             A Subodh Gupta oil painting showing
three bicycle-riding doodhwalas, or milk sellers, sold for more
than double its estimate at an online auction as demand revived
for Indian artists.  
 The untitled work by Gupta, 46, in the semi-photorealist
technique, had a presale high estimate of $240,000 and sold for
$494,500 at the auction by  Saffronart  yesterday. A work by Syed
Haider Raza titled “La Provence Noire,” fetched $746,111. Raza,
88, graduated from the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  
 Bidders sought works by painters such as Raza and Maqbool
Fida Husain, India’s best-known artist, as economic recovery
revives demand for the country’s art. Asia’s largest economy
after Japan and China may grow at between 9 percent and 10
percent annually in the coming years,  Chakravarthy Rangarajan ,
chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said
yesterday,  
 Husain’s “8 Horses,” fetched $442,750, while  Francis Newton Souza ’s “Head of a Man” sold for $261,625, the auction
house said in a statement.  
 Yesterday’s sale follows last week’s auction at Christie’s
International in London of works by Souza, India’s priciest
modern artist. That sale raised 5.4 million pounds ($8 million)
with fees, exceeding a presale upper forecast of 2.3 million
pounds.  
 Prices for contemporary works increased sevenfold between
2000 and 2008, according to the French-based database Artprice.
Values of modern and contemporary Indian works fell less than
counterparts in many other countries during the financial crisis.  
 The Christie’s auction, from Souza’s estate, included a
work by Raza, a member of the “Progressive Artists Group,”
that sold for 2.4 million pounds, a record for a modern or
contemporary Indian work of art, the auction house said. Souza
died in Mumbai in 2002.  
 Saffronart sold $6.7 million of paintings in the auction,
with 81 percent of the lots finding buyers.
