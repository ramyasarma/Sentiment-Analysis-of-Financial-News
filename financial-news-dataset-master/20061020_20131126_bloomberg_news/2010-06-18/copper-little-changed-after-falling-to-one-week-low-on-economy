             Copper prices fell to a one-week low
on mounting concern that the economic rebound may be weaker than
forecasts in the U.S., the world’s second-largest consumer.  
 Manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in June
at the slowest pace since August, and initial jobless claims
rose in the week ended June 12, data showed yesterday. Analysts
started to lower forecasts for the economy for the first time
since the recovery began in the middle of 2009.  
 “We’re set for an industrial slowdown,” James Dailey, who
manages $145 million at TEAM Financial Asset Management LLC in
Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania , said in an interview in  New York .
Another recession is possible, he said.  
 Copper futures for September delivery dropped 2.25 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.9015 a pound on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $2.863, the lowest level for a most-
active contract since June 10. The metal, little changed this
week, has dropped 13 percent this year.  
 Copper for delivery in three months dropped $11, or 0.2
percent, to $6,435 a metric ton ($2.92 a pound) on the  London 
Metal Exchange.  
 “Some weakening” in  China , the top copper consumer, will
result from government attempts to slow economic growth, said
Jochen Hitzfeld, an analyst at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “Copper
prices will stay around $6,400” a ton in the second half, he
said.  
 Aluminum, nickel, tin, zinc and lead prices also fell on
the LME.
