             China should return to a normalized
monetary policy in the second half of the year, Xia Bin, one of
the People’s Bank of China’s academic advisers, said at a
conference in Shanghai today.  
 An 18 percent, or 7.5 trillion yuan, rise in loan growth
this year was “reasonable,” Xia said.  
 China’s property market should take two to three years to
“squeeze,” said Xia, who suggested a cumulative tax on
property sales as an alternative to a property tax as it would
be easier to implement.  
 The Asian nation’s consumer price index may rise sharply in
June and July, Xia said. Inflation should be manageable for the
full-year, he said.
