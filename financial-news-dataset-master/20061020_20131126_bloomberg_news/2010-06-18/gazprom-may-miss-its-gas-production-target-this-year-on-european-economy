             OAO Gazprom  may miss its gas
production target this year after demand in southern Europe fell
sharply because of the region’s economic situation, said Chief
Executive Officer  Alexei Miller .  
 “All that we are hearing about the crisis in the euro
zone, about the crisis of the state debts in the euro zone, we
have seen today in the real economy,” Miller said today at an
energy roundtable during the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum. “This is a fact.”  
 Gazprom, which supplies about a quarter of Europe’s gas,
said the recovery that it had been seeing from the global
economic crisis since the first half of last year stalled. Cold
winter weather boosted consumption in Russia and Europe in the
first four months.  
 While consumption in southern and southeastern Europe has
fallen since early May, gas demand in northern Europe and
Germany, in particular, has seen a “significant increase,”
Miller said. The trend in the European Union has split for the
first time “in a long time,” Miller said.  
 Earlier this month, Gazprom stepped back from a production
target of 529 billion cubic meters of gas for this year, given
by Miller in April.  
 The Russian gas export monopoly plans to produce 519.3
billion cubic meters of gas this year,  Vsevolod Cherepanov , head
of the gas, condensate and oil production department, said on
June 9. Gazprom’s output slumped to 462 billion cubic meters
last year.  
 The company aims to produce 528.6 billion cubic meters of
gas next year, Cherepanov said.
