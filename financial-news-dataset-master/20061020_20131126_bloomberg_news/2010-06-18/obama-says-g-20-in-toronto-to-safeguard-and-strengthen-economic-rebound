             President Barack Obama called on his
Group of 20 counterparts to “safeguard and strengthen” the
global economic recovery.  
 In a letter to leaders ahead of next week’s G-20 summit in
Toronto, Obama said while governments should commit to restoring
sustainable public finances in the medium term, “we should
reaffirm our unity of purpose to provide the policy support
necessary to keep economic growth strong.”
“Should confidence in the strength of our recoveries diminish,
we should be prepared to respond to act again as quickly and as
forefully as needed to avert a slowdown in economic activity,”
Obama said in the letter, released by the White House.
