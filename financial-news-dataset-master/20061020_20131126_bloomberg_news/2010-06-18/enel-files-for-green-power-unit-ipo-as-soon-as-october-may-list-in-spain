             Enel SpA , Italy’s biggest utility,
filed a request today with the Italian Stock exchange for the
initial public offering of shares in its Enel Green Power unit
as soon as October.  
 The timing of the IPO will depend on “market conditions,”
according to an Enel statement distributed by the Italian
Exchange. Enel said it also may seek a listing of EGP’s shares
on other markets including Spain.  
 The Rome-based utility said it’s continuing “to consider
agreements with long-term investors for the sale of a minority
stake in EGP, to be carried out in conjunction with or as an
alternative” to the IPO.  
 Enel Green Power manages wind, solar, biomass,
hydroelectric and geothermal power generation in 17 nations in
Europe and the Americas. The IPO is the centerpiece of Enel’s
plans to sell 7 billion euros ($8.6 billion) of assets to reduce
debt to 45 billion euros this year from 51 billion euros.  
 Enel expects to raise about 4 billion euros in the share
sale, Enel Chief Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti  said April 9.
