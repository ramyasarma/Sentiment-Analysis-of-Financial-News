             U.S. Representative Edward Markey, a
Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the Energy and
Environment subcommittee, said in an interview for Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with Al Hunt,” airing this
weekend, that Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Mitsui & Co. should
set aside money to pay a share of claims tied to the BP Plc oil
spill.  
 (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  
 AL HUNT: And we begin the program with Congressman Ed
Markey of Massachusetts and chairman of the Energy and
Environment subcommittee. Congressman, you heard from BP this
week. You looked at the whole record. Can the United States
continue to do business with a company with the current
management, Tony Hayward, the CEO?  
 REPRESENTATIVE ED MARKEY: I think that whether he stays in
his present job will be determined by his actions. This week we
saw that they are now willing to put up $20 billion as an escrow
account to ensure that people who have been harmed in the gulf
are compensated. And as each day goes by we are going to need
more evidence that this management should be able to stay in
place.  
 HUNT: From what you know do you think it should?  
 MARKEY: Honestly, they clearly are incompetent. They
clearly have been lying the whole way. If I had my way they
would be gone, but they are the management team right now.  
 They have begun to take steps. We saw that in the White
House. And we should try our best to extract what we can from
them right now and see what happens at the point at which they
go back into their ostrich-like posture, then that is the time
to say they have to go.  
 HUNT: You mentioned the $20 billion escrow fund. Two other
companies, Anadarko Petroleum and Matsui Oil, together own 35%
of the lease of that well. Should they be pressured by the
government to set aside another $10 billion for that fund?  
 MARKEY: Without question investors in these kinds of
operations are in for better or for worse. So here, yes, the
worst has happened. And so they have a responsibility to ensure
that they are contributing to any fund that is constructed for
any part of the reconstruction of the Gulf of Mexico.  
 They should not be exempt. They are part of the totality of
the solution as well as what they hoped to be a very profitable
operation. But they cannot escape responsibility.  
 HUNT: Congressman, let me ask you. You look over the next
10 years. What is preferable? What is the least bad option,
offshore drilling or dependency on foreign oil, because in the
short term that is the choice we really face, isn’t it?  
 MARKEY: Well, you have to put together a plan in either
instance. We only have 2% of the world’s oil reserves and we
consume 25% of the world’s oil on a daily basis. So, on the one
hand you need a plan that you put in place so that you can tell
OPEC that we don’t need their oil any more than we need their
sand.  
 At the same time we are out 50 miles in the ocean and five
miles deep trying to extract the final 2% of the oil which we
have in our country. So, either way we need to put in place a
comprehensive plan that moves us away from fossil fuels and
towards indigenously produced energy sources using American
technology.  
 HUNT: The Jones Act prohibits foreign operated fleets from
operating in U.S. waterways. There are apparently Saudi tankers
that some think could help with this cleanup. Should the Jones
Act be waived now and should we bring in all those foreign
tankers that could help in the gulf?  
 MARKEY: The administration has to look very closely at an
all hands on deck response to this problem. Whether -  
 HUNT: Which might include waiving the Jones Act
temporarily.  
 MARKEY: Because of the emergency situation that exists for
that purpose I think it has to be looked at. We have to look at
all parts of the world to find the help we need to ensure that
we minimize the harm that is done to the people who live in the
gulf region.  
 HUNT: Mr. Chairman, Senate Democrats say there is no way,
including Harry Reid, no way to get 60 votes for any cap on
carbon emissions. Speaker Pelosi says the House, having gone
through this, is not going to accept a bill for that greenhouse
caps. Can you outline any compromise for this seeming impasse?  
 MARKEY: One of the silver linings of what is going on in
the Gulf of Mexico is that the attention of the American public
is riveted on the energy issue. I don’t think that there is any
question that we have to move to wind, solar, biomass,
geothermal, plug-in hybrids, doubling the efficiency of the new
buildings in our country, the new appliances in our country.  
 I think that we can make this case. If the president uses
the bully pulpit for the next couple of months, challenging us
to create a new industrial sector rather than importing from
China these new energy technologies, challenging us to back out
the oil from OPEC, I think we can still pass a very good energy
and climate bill. The president called for that, that is to pass
a new -  
 HUNT: With a cap on carbon emissions?  
 MARKEY: Yes. The president -  
 HUNT: You think it can get back to the Senate.  
 MARKEY: The president on Wednesday night in his address to
the American people called for passage of an equivalent bill
like Congressman Waxman, and I and Speaker Pelosi passed through
-  
 HUNT: Right.  
 MARKEY: - the House of Representatives last year. He said
he wants a comprehensive energy and climate bill and if the case
is made and is made consistently, that we will be successful.  
 Remember, back in January of this year people said once the
Senate seat in Massachusetts was lost to the Republicans, -  
 HUNT: Right.  
 MARKEY: - that no health-care bill could pass, two months
later, signing ceremony in the Rose Garden. I think the same
thing is going to happen here.  
 HUNT: The president the other night made a big deal of gulf
restoration, said we have to rebuild that coastal area. And he
tapped Ray Mabus, former governor of Mississippi, to head it.
But Ray Mabus is going to stay on as secretary of the Navy.
Should that restoration project be run as a part-time job, or is
that a full-time job?  
 MARKEY: Well, Ray Mabus is an excellent choice. He will be
there with the, all of the Navy plus the expertise of having
been the governor of Mississippi, one of the gulf states.  
 HUNT: So you don’t think he should step down as secretary
of the Navy to do this full-time?  
 MARKEY: There are many jobs that are going to have to
actually be taken on in the next several weeks, months and
years. It is not just that. There has to be a public health
component to it.  
 Ken Feinberg is going to be running the compensation part
of it. The part that Ray Mabus is taking on fits him like a
glove, governor of Mississippi, secretary of the Navy, knows the
region and knows how to command respect and results when he
gives the orders.  
 HUNT: Okay, Chairman Markey, thank you very much after
really an extraordinary week.
