             Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  told policy makers today that China’s strengthening
recovery is spurring concern that the economy is in a bubble, a
Cabinet Office official said.  
 Shirakawa made the remarks to Cabinet members who gathered
in Tokyo today to discuss the government’s economic assessment,
 Keisuke Tsumura , a parliamentary secretary at the Cabinet
Office who was at the meeting, said at a press conference.  
 China, the fastest-growing major economy, has been driving
the global recovery.  Exports  jumped the most in six years in
May, property prices rose at a near-record pace and  inflation 
jumped to the highest in 19 months, putting pressure on Chinese
authorities to let the yuan rise and increase  interest rates .  
 Japan has relied on demand from China, the country’s
biggest overseas market, to fuel its own export-led rebound.
Shipments abroad contributed the most to Japan’s 5 percent
annualized  expansion  in the first quarter. China  grew  11.9
percent in the period, the fastest pace in almost three years.  
 Shirakawa said policy makers in China are addressing the
risk of overheating, according to Tsumura. The central bank
governor spoke in response to a question by Chief Cabinet
Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku .  
 Hitoshi Iwabuchi, a Bank of Japan spokesman, declined to
comment on the remarks relayed by Tsumura.  
 U.S. Pressure  
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said at a
congressional hearing on June 10 that a more flexible yuan
would allow China to pursue “a more effective, independent
monetary policy, which is particularly important now, with
China’s economy facing a risk of inflation in goods and in
asset prices.”  
 The People’s Bank of China has refrained from raising
interest rates this year, instead trying to tame lending by
increasing banks’ reserve requirements on three occasions.
Banks extended 639.4 billion yuan ($94 billion) of new loans in
May, more than 600 billion yuan median estimate of economists.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  has lost 23 percent this year,
the third-worst performer among 93 global indexes tracked by
Bloomberg, on concern government measures to rein in housing
prices and the European debt crisis will damp growth. The gauge
dropped 1.8 percent today, the most in three weeks.  
 Chinese officials may introduce a trial real-estate tax
after already tightening sales rules for developers, raising
some down-payment requirements and restricting loans for
multiple-home buyers, according to state media.
