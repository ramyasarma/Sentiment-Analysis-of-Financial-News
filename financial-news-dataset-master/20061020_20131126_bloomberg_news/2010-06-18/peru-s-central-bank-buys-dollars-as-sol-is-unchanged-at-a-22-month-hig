             Peru’s central bank purchased
dollars for the first time in two months to curb gains in the
sol after it rose to its strongest level since August 2008.  
 The bank  bought  $73 million at 2.8278 soles per dollar, its
first intervention since April 15, when it bought $91 million,
it said on its website.  
 The sol was unchanged at 2.8285 per dollar today as
increased demand yesterday at a Spanish bond sale and an
agreement by European Union leaders to disclose how banks
perform on stress tests damped investor concern about the
region’s financial system.  
 “The sol has risen in line with other currencies in the
region due to less uncertainty in the euro zone,” Jorge
Estrella, the central bank’s head of monetary policy, said today
in an interview in Lima.  
 The currency increased 0.6 percent this week, the best
performance since the period ending May 14.  
 South America’s sixth-largest economy may expand 6.6
percent this year, according to a central bank forecast issued
today, compared with an earlier forecast of 5.5 percent. GDP
growth is below potential and internal demand for goods and
services has room to increase without fuelling inflation,
central bank President  Julio Velarde  told reporters at the bank
in Lima.  
 The economy expanded at the fastest pace in 19 months in
April as rising company and household spending boosted
construction, manufacturing and retail output, the national
statistics agency reported June 15. GDP grew 9.3 percent from a
year earlier, beating the 8.8 percent median estimate of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.86 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local
unit.
