             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index fell
for a second day, erasing an earlier advance, as a decline in
commodities prices dragged down producers. The real rose for a
second week, the longest stretch of gains since April.  
 Iron-ore producer  Vale SA  dropped 1.3 percent and
steelmaker  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA  fell as base metals
prices slid for a third day.  Cosan SA Industria e Comercio , the
world’s biggest sugar-cane processor, declined for the first
time in seven days following a drop in sugar prices.  
 The  Bovespa  stock index slid 0.2 percent to 64,437.58,
paring its gain this week to 1.3 percent. Thirty-five stocks
fell on the index while 29 rose. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap  index
retreated for the first time in seven days, losing 0.1 percent
to 1,149.91. The real gained 0.5 percent to 1.7721 per dollar
and climbed 2.2 percent this week.  
 “Without much direction for the market, Vale is pushing it
down today,” said  Augusto Lange , who helps manage 1.25 billion
reais ($706 million) at Neo Gestao de Recursos in Sao Paulo.
“There’s a certain optimism as we near the end of the first
half.”  
 Brazil stocks gained as much as 0.6 percent earlier today
amid speculation stress tests will show Europe’s banks are
robust, easing concern the global economic recovery will stall.  
 Vale , the world’s largest iron-ore producer, declined for a
third day, losing 1.3 percent to 40.67 reais, while  CSN ,
Brazil’s third-biggest steelmaker, slid 1 percent to 26.87
reais. Cosan lost 0.4 percent to 22.51 reais.  
 Copper Retreats  
 Copper prices fell to a one-week low on mounting concern
that the economic rebound may be weaker than forecasts in the
U.S., the world’s second-largest consumer.  
 Manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in June
at the slowest pace since August, and initial jobless claims
rose in the week ended June 12, data showed yesterday. Analysts
started to lower forecasts for the economy for the first time
since the recovery began in the middle of 2009.  
 The European Union said yesterday it will publish the
results of stress tests on the region’s lenders after Spain
became the first European government to pledge to release
results on individual banks.  
 The decision comes more than a year after the U.S. issued
results of tests it carried out on 19 financial institutions.
Publication helped trigger a rally that lifted the  Standard and
Poor’s 500 Financials Index  36 percent from the start of May
through the end of last year.  
 The Bovespa index  trades  for 12.3 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 12.2 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index  of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.7
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.8 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
