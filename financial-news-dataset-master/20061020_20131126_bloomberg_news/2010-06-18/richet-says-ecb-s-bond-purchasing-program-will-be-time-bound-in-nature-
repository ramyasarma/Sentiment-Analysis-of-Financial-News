             European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the bank’s bond-purchase program is
“time-bound in nature” and doesn’t change the ECB’s monetary
policy stance.  
 “It is aimed at ensuring the proper transmission of
monetary-policy impulses to the wider economy and, ultimately,
to the general price level,” Trichet said in a  speech  in Moscow
today. “We have not changed our monetary-policy stance: we have
maintained the current level of interest rates, a level that is,
in our view, appropriate.”  
 Investor concern that a Greek deficit crisis will spread
across the 16-nation euro region last month prompted European
leaders to pledge a 750 billion-euro ($930 billion) bailout
package to backstop fiscally distressed countries. The ECB is
buying state debt and pumping unlimited funds into the banking
system as part of the strategy.  
 “The bond purchases made on the secondary market cannot be
used to circumvent the fundamental principle of budgetary
discipline,” Trichet said. At the same time, “it must be borne
in mind that the fiscal position of the euro area is, on
average, more favorable in relative terms than that of most
other advanced economies.”
