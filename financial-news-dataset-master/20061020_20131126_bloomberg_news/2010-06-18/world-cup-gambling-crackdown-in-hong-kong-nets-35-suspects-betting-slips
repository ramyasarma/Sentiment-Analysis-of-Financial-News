             Hong Kong police have arrested
35 people in a crackdown against illegal gambling on the World
Cup soccer tournament in South Africa.  
 Betting slips seized by the police show illegal bookmakers
took in more than HK$70 million ($9 million) in wagers on the
tournament, according to four statements from the Hong Kong
police. The biggest raid, code-named “Zonebuilder,” was run in
conjunction with Chinese authorities and led to 25 arrests, the
police said June 13.  
 The crackdown shows illegal gambling remains a problem for
Hong Kong police, seven years after the government authorized
the  Hong Kong Jockey Club  to be the sole soccer betting operator.
Police seized 18 computers and shut down 13 websites in the
“Zonebuilder” raid, a statement said.  
 “Police will continue taking vigorous enforcement action
against illegal bookmaking activities during the course of the
World Cup,” said Police Superintendent Man Tat-shing from the
Organized Crime and Triad Bureau. The final match is July 11.  
 Chinese bank accounts were used by the betting ring cracked
by the cross-border operation involving authorities in Shenzhen,
the Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.  
 The Jockey Club, which also operates Hong Kong’s horse
races and lottery, took in HK$35.1 billion in annual soccer
betting revenue, according to its 2009  annual report .  
 The club declined comment on the police action, which began
June 12, the day after the games started.
