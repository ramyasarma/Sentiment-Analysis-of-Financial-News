             Motricity Inc. , which sells software
to mobile-phone companies that lets users access the Internet,
retreated in its first day of trading after cutting the size of
its initial public offering by as much as 54 percent.  
 The Bellevue, Washington-based company  slipped 7.4 percent
to $9.26 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after selling 5 million
shares at $10 each yesterday. Motricity had originally offered
6.75 million for $14 to $16, according to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing. The company said in a separate
filing that  Carl Icahn , who owned an 18.5 percent stake in the
company, agreed to buy as many as 1 million shares in the IPO.  
 The reduction came after companies from  Oasis Petroleum
Inc.  to CBOE Holdings Inc. priced initial offerings within their
forecast range, making it the biggest week for U.S. IPOs this
year as the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  erased its 2010 decline.
At least 34 companies worldwide had postponed or withdrawn IPOs
since the beginning of May as the European debt crisis sent the
 S&P 500  down as much as 14 percent from its 2010 high.  
 “If you bring a good company at a fair price, it’s going
to get done,” said  Timothy Cunningham , who helps oversee $57
billion at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New
Mexico. “If you’ve got a company that’s weaker, that was priced
too aggressively, then you end up with this last minute where
you’re scrambling, cutting size, cutting price to try to get it
done.”  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  of New
York led the sale for Motricity, which has posted  losses  every
year since at least 2005, according to the SEC filing.  
 Oasis Rallies  
 Oasis Petroleum  extended its two-day rally to 14 percent
today after raising $588 million selling shares at the midpoint
of its forecast range in the second-biggest U.S. IPO this year.  
 Morgan Stanley in New York and  UBS AG  of Zurich managed
Houston-based Oasis Petroleum’s sale, which was the largest deal
of 2010 after  Sensata Technologies Holding NV’s  $654 million
offering in March, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 CBOE , the last major securities U.S. securities exchange
owned by its members, gained 6.9 percent this week after raising
$339 million selling shares at the top end of its price range on
June 14. The $1.15 billion sold in this week’s five U.S. IPOs
was the most this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Goldman Sachs managed the offering from CBOE, along with
Gaithersburg, Maryland-based BroadSoft Inc’s $67.5 million deal
with  Jefferies Group Inc.  of New York. Goldman also led this
week’s offering from  Higher One Holdings Inc. , which cut the
size of its IPO by 55 percent.  
 Higher One, the New Haven, Connecticut-based company that
provides banking services to college students,  surged  26 percent
in two days of trading.  
 “The market performance and the strong relative
performance by riskier assets over the past two weeks have
afforded an opportunity to bring successful IPOs,” said  Marc Pado , the San Francisco-based U.S. market strategist at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP. “That’s been a sign that we’ve been able to get
past some of the big concerns.”
