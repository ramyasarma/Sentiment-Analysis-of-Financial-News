             A.R. Capital Group Inc.’s  Alan Fishman , a car-service driver before he launched the hedge fund,
was sentenced to 37 months in prison for his role in stealing
from investors, federal prosecutors in New York said.  
 Fishman, 50, and Daniel Ledven, 38, a principal at the
firm, pleaded guilty in March to one count each of conspiring to
commit securities fraud, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York
said today in a statement. Ledven was sentenced to 57 months in
prison, according to the statement.  
 A.R. Capital raised about $20 million from individual
investors in its purported hedge fund between 2003 and September
2006, claiming the money would be invested in international real
estate companies and used for leveraged trading, prosecutors
said. About $18 million of the money was wired to bank accounts
in the Ukraine, prosecutors said.  
 Domenico Savatta, a lawyer for Fishman, and Henry Putzel, a
lawyer representing Ledven, didn’t immediately return calls to
their offices after regular business hours.  
 The case is U.S. v. Ledven, 09-1088, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)
