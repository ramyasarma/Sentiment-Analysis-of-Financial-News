             Spain’s  IBEX 35 Index  rose 2.2
percent to 9,971.8, for a weekly advance of 4.3 percent.  
 The following were among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market today.  
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria  (BBVA SM) gained 5.6
percent to 9.36 euros, rising for an eighth session. The
country’s second-largest bank scored the second-highest rating
among Europe’s largest banks in stress tests carried out by the
Committee of European Banking Supervisors, El Economista
reported, citing a copy of the test to which it had access.  
 The Bank of Spain is carrying out stress tests throughout
the nation’s financial system and will publish the results in
coming weeks, Deputy Bank of Spain Governor Javier Ariztegui
said today in Santander, Spain. The health of Spain’s banking
system is generally “good,” he said.  
 Bankinter SA  (BKT SM), a Spanish bank with two-thirds of
its loan book in mortgages, jumped 14 percent to 5.40 euros for
the biggest gain in Europe’s Stoxx 600 Index.  Banco de Sabadell

SA, gained 5 percent to 3.78 euros.  
 Banco Santander SA  (SAN SM), Spain’s largest bank, rose 3.5
percent to 9.35 euros. The lender said it made an offer to
acquire about 300 British bank branches being sold by Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc to expand in the U.K. Santander bid as
much as 1.7 billion pounds ($2.52 billion), according to a
person familiar with the plans.
