             The cost of protecting Australian
and Japanese corporate bonds from non-payment declined,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 3.5 basis points to
124.5 basis points as of 3:10 p.m. in Sydney, ICAP Plc prices
show. The Markit  iTraxx Japan index  dropped 3 basis points to
130 as of 2:04 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Morgan Stanley.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1 basis point to 130 as of 1:07 p.m.
in Singapore after earlier dropping 3 basis points, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
