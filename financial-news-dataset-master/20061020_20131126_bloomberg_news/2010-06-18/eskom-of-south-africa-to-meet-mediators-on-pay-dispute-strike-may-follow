             Eskom Holdings Ltd., the state-owned
South African power utility, will meet mediators this weekend to
discuss a pay increase for its workers, the National Union of
Mineworkers said.  
 The labor union may consider applying for a strike
certificate on June 21 if the mediation fails, Paris Mashego, a
spokesman for the NUM, said in a phone interview today.  
 Eskom is offering employees an 8 percent pay increase,
while the labor union has demanded 15 percent.  
 “Our members don’t want a strike, but if Eskom wants one
we will give them one,” Mashego said. “We believe there is
room for a settlement.”
