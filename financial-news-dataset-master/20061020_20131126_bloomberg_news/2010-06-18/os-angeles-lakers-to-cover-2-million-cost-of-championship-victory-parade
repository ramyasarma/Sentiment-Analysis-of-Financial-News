             The Los Angeles Lakers will cover
the cost of their championship parade after winning the National
Basketball Association title for the second straight year.  
 The Lakers will privately fund the June 21 parade, the team
said in a  news release  posted on its website. They’ll spend
about $2 million to cover costs such as police overtime and
other civic duties, according to the Associated Press.  
 A year ago, following the Lakers’ championship-series win
over the Orlando Magic, billionaires  Eli Broad  and  Haim Saban 
agreed to help the team pay for the victory parade after unions
complained the city couldn’t afford to share the expense.  
 The Lakers earned a repeat celebration last night with an
83-79 win over the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the NBA Finals,
claiming the franchise’s 16th championship.  
 They are expecting between 500,000 and 2 million fans on
the two-mile parade route, based on attendance figures from
championships in 2002 and 2009.
