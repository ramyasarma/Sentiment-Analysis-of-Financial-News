             Air France-KLM Group SA , Europe’s
biggest airline, said French unions have called a one-day
strike to protest government plans to increase the national
retirement age.  
 It’s too early to judge whether the action on June 24 will
affect flights, company spokesman  Cedric Leurquin  said. The
CGT, CFDT, CFTC, FSU, Solidaires and Unsa unions issued a joint
strike call, he said.  
 Three of the unions, CGT, CFDT and Unsa, have been joined
by Sud-Rail in a separate June 24 strike call at national rail
operator Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais, La
Tribune reported. SNCF spokeswoman Julie Vion-Broussailles
didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.
