             Eskom Holdings Ltd., the state-owned
South African electricity utility, agreed to IPSA Group Plc
becoming one of the first independent power producers to
contribute to the country’s national grid, Business Day
reported.  
 IPSA will supply nine days of electricity this month,
enabling other independent producers to contribute to power
generation in the country, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said, citing Kannan Lakmeeharan, managing director of Eskom’s
planning division.  
 Eskom has also concluded power-purchase accords with Sasol
Ltd., Sappi Ltd. and Tangent Mining, it said.
