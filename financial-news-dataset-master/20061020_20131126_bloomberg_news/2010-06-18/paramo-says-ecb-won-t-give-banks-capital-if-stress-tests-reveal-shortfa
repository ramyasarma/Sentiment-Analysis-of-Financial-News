             European Central Bank Executive
Board Member  Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo  said the central bank
will ‘absolutely not” provide banks with capital should stress
tests show they need it.  
 “That is not part of the ECB’s functions,” Gonzalez-
Paramo told reporters in Malaga, Spain, today. “It’s up to the
governments and national supervisors.”  
 European Union leaders yesterday decided to publish the
results of stress tests on the region’s lenders after Spanish
bank officials unexpectedly pledged to make public results on
individual banks.  
 While the ECB “will collaborate in the coordination” of
the publication of the results, it is ultimately “the
responsibility of the national supervisors,” Gonzalez-Paramo
said.  
 The studies will be done “institution by institution,”
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  told reporters at an EU summit
in Brussels yesterday. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said it
was important to give “maximum transparency.” Asked how the
governments would react if the tests revealed shortcomings, she
said the EU has “taken precautions,” including a 750 billion-
euro ($928 billion) financial backstop.  
 Gonzalez-Paramo said Spain faces a “singular challenge”
because of the diverse nature of its financial industry.  
 “In Spain, the banking system is very heterogeneous --
there are big banks, mid and small-sized banks and then the
whole caja sector that’s rather unknown,” he said. “Spain has
a special and singular challenge which is to be particularly
transparent with the cajas sector.”  
 When asked whether it is necessary to publish the results
of the stress tests, Gonazalez-Paramo said that “at this stage
and with the tensions we have seen in the markets the answer is
yes.”
