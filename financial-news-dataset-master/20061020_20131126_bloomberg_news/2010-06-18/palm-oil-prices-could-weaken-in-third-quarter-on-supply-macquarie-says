             Palm oil prices may decline in the
third quarter on increased supply of the tropical oil and its
substitute, soybean oil, Macquarie Capital Securities (Malaysia)
Sdn. analyst  Sunaina Dhanuka  said in an e-mailed report.  
 Palm oil futures on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange could
average 2,450 ringgit ($751) a metric ton in the third quarter,
from a forecast of 2,475 ringgit a ton this quarter, she said.  
 The most active contract has averaged 2,489 ringgit so far
this quarter. Her third-quarter forecast compares to an average
of 2,204 ringgit in the same period last year.  
 “In the near term, fundamentals remain weak and will
continue to pressure prices over the course of the year, driven
by record soybean stocks,” Dhanuka said.  
 Palm oil and soybean oil account for more than three-fifths
of edible oils consumed worldwide. Palm oil is mainly produced
in Indonesia and Malaysia, and soybeans in the U.S., Brazil and
Argentina.  
 Palm oil prices rose 57 percent in 2009 amid concern of El
Nino weather affecting oil palms, while the South American
soybean crop was ravaged by drought. Palm oil prices have fallen
10 percent this year as a record global soybean crop is
replenishing stockpiles and easing supply concerns.  
 Raised Forecast  
 OilWorld, an industry publication, raised its forecast for
global output of 10 oilseeds for 2010-2011 to a record 438.8
million tons, from 438.7 million last year. It raised its
Argentina soybean estimate by 0.7 million tons to 55 million
tons compared to a drought-affected harvest of 31.5 million tons.
Its South American crop forecast is 136 million tons, from 97
million tons last year, with harvests ending last month, it said.  
 “Supplies of soybeans have become ample,” and soybean
stocks will be “substantial” until August, which will have a
bearish impact on edible oils prices, it said in its June 11
weekly report.  
 Dhanuka forecast an average of 2,500 ringgit this year,
compared to the current year-to-date average of 2,529 ringgit,
rising to an average of 2,610 ringgit next year, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 Dry weather last year and earlier this year may hurt
fourth-quarter oil palm yields, she added, lifting average
prices to 2,550 ringgit in the last quarter and 2,750 ringgit in
the first quarter of 2011.  
 PT  Astra Agro Lestari , Indonesia’s top publicly traded
plantation company, yesterday said drought hurt palm oil output
for January-May, which fell 3 percent to 373,631 tons from a
year earlier.  
 Palm oil futures for September delivery advanced 0.4
percent to 2,408 ringgit ($742) a ton at 11:43 a.m. in Singapore.
