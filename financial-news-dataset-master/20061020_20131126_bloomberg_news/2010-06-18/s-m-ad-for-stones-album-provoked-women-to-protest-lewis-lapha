             Bound with ropes, bruises clearly
visible, a giant, scantily clad woman sprawled on the billboard
high above Sunset Boulevard. It was model Anita Russell
promoting a new album. “I’m Black and Blue from the Rolling
Stones,” she exclaimed. “And I love it!”  
 The year was 1976 and women were taking a closer look at
the way they were portrayed in popular culture. Fed up with the
flagrantly misogynistic images used to titillate men and move
product, Los Angeles feminist group Women Against Violence
Against Women staged a demonstration, getting widespread media
coverage.  
 The S&M-tinged billboard was removed. The album went on to
spend four weeks at the top of the charts, ultimately going
platinum. Debate about the imagery of the female body continues.  
 I spoke with  Christine Stansell , author of “ The Feminist
Promise ” (Modern Library), on the following topics:  
 1. Exclusion of Women  
 2. Getting the Vote  
 3. Viragos and Harpies  
 4. Body Politics  
 5. Love and Work
