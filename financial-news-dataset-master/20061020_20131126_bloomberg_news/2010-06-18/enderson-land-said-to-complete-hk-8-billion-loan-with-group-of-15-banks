             Henderson Land Development Co. ,
controlled by Hong Kong real estate billionaire Lee Shau-kee,
will finalize its list of lenders for a HK$8 billion ($1 billion)
loan today, according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 About 15 banks agreed to contribute to the loan, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the details are
private. Contracts will be signed on June 28, they said.  
 Lenders who pledged at least HK$1.5 billion will get 89
basis points more than the Hong Kong interbank offered rate, or
Hibor, comprising fees and 78 basis points of interest, said the
person. Commitments of more than HK$1 billion get 88.5 basis
points and those over HK$500 million get 88 basis points.  
 The five-year facility is split between a HK$5.6 billion
revolving loan and a HK$2.4 billion term loan, the person said.
