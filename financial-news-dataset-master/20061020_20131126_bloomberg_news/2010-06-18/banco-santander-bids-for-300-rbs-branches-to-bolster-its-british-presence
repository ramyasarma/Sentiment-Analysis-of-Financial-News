             Banco Santander SA , Spain’s biggest
bank, offered as much as 1.7 billion pounds ($2.52 billion) to
buy more than 300 bank branches from  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc  and bolster its existing British network, according to
a person familiar with the plans.  
 A transaction may be concluded within weeks, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the details are
confidential. Santander has presented an offer and doesn’t know
when the tender process will end, the Santander, Spain-based
lender said today in a statement.  
 The branch network would “fit like a glove” for
Santander,  Matias Inciarte , a vice chairman at the bank, said
yesterday. Santander has boosted its presence in the U.K. with
acquisitions of lenders including Alliance & Leicester Plc since
taking over Abbey National in 2004. It has 1,300 U.K. outlets.
The disposal follows a  European Union  ruling last year which
forced the Edinburgh-based bank to shed outlets as a consequence
of 45.5 billion pounds received in state aid.  
 The sale is “yet another nail in the coffin of the diverse
financial services sector which consumers have long benefited
from,” said  Rob MacGregor , national officer of the  Unite  trade
union. “On the basis of market competition on the high street,
this sale is bad news.”  
 Officials at  RBS  and Santander declined to comment on the
price offered.  
 Santander added 276,000 new British bank account customers
in the first quarter as it rebranded 1,000 Abbey and Bradford &
Bingley branches with its own name. Santander was Britain’s
third largest deposit-taker with 25 million customers and the
U.K.’s second-largest lender by stock of mortgages last year.  
 ‘Sole Bidder’  
 The Spanish bank is the sole remaining bidder for 318
British bank branches, a person briefed on the situation said
yesterday.  National Australia Bank Ltd.  and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA, Spain’s second-largest bank, earlier dropped out
of the bidding for the RBS branches.  
 The RBS network offered for sale is composed of RBS
branches in England and Wales, originally branded Williams &
Glyn’s, and its Natwest branches in Scotland. It also agreed to
sell other units including insurance and Global Merchant
Services, its credit card payment processing unit.
