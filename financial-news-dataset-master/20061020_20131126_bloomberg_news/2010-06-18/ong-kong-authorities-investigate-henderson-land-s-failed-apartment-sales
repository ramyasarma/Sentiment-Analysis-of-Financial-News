             Hong Kong regulatory and law
enforcement authorities are “looking into and following up on”
20 canceled apartment sales at  Henderson Land Development Co.’s 
 39 Conduit Road project , according to a government statement.  
 “The government firmly believes that transactions
involving private residential properties should be fair and
transparent, and will not tolerate any forged non-bona fide
transactions,” said the statement issued late yesterday.  
 Henderson, controlled by billionaire  Lee Shau-kee , will
provide “all necessary information” to Hong Kong authorities,
spokeswoman  Bonnie Ngan  said by telephone today. The sales were
canceled due to “the economic environment” and lending
policies that were tightened by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
Ngan said.  
 The government didn’t specify which agencies were looking
into the canceled sales. It had earlier questioned why 24
apartment sales reported in the company’s results last year had
not been completed.  
 Henderson said this week that four sales had been completed
and 20 had collapsed.
