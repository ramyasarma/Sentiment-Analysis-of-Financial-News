             President  Barack Obama  ordered
federal agencies to create a uniform “do not pay list” to
reduce some of the $110 billion in improper or erroneous
payments made by the government last year.  
 The list is intended to prevent benefit checks, grants or
contract payments from being made to individuals or companies
that aren’t qualified to receive them.  
 “We have the weapons” to find waste and fraud, Vice
President  Joe Biden  said at a news conference in Washington.
“The more who know about this, the less inclined they are
going to be” in trying to cheat the government.  
 A government-wide database, still in development while
being used for the $862 billion stimulus program, would screen
contractors, subcontractors and businesses, or individuals who
obtain federal contracts to see if they have been convicted of
federal fraud, operate phony businesses, owe back taxes, or
otherwise would be ineligible for government payments or
benefits.  
 “While identifying and recapturing improper payments is
important, prevention of payment errors before they occur
should be the first priority in protecting taxpayer resources
from waste, fraud and abuse,” Obama said in a presidential
memorandum released by the White House.  
 Limits on Lobbyists  
 In a separate memorandum to heads of departments and
agencies today, the president made formal a policy intended to
keep registered lobbyists from serving on government boards and
commissions.  
 While lobbyists sometimes can play a “constructive”
role, “their service in privileged positions within the
executive branch can perpetuate the culture of special-interest
access,” Obama wrote. The directive says department and agency
executives shouldn’t make any new appointments or
reappointments of lobbyists, making official a practice the
memo says is already in place.  
 The effort to use government databases to prevent improper
payments will first be applied to the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, which accounted for $65 billion of the $110
billion in improper payments, Biden said.  
 Some government payments have been going out for “the
wrong amount, the wrong person or for the wrong reason,” Biden
said. Over the past three years, the government paid more than
$180 million to about 20,000 people who were dead, and another
$230 million to 14,000 fugitive felons, he said.  
 Eroding Confidence  
 “It erodes the bottom line of public confidence in
federal programs,” Biden said.  
 In administering payments under the stimulus, the
government tracks names, addresses, management profiles and
amounts of money paid to contractors. In some cases, the
officials have found that there were multiple companies sharing
the same address and competing for government contracts, said
White House budget director  Peter Orszag , who accompanied Biden
at the event.  
 “One might believe that those five companies are not all
independent of one another and that there might be connections
that should be examined among and between them,” Orszag said.
