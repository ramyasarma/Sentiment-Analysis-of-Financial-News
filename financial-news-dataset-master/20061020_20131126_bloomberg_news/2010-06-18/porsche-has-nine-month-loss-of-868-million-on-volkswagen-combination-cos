             Porsche SE  improved its full-year
forecast after the carmaking division’s sales beat analysts’
estimates as the new Panamera sedan attracted buyers.  
 The loss for the year ending July 31 will be less than
1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), the maker of the 911 sports-car
said today in a statement. That compares with a “low single-
digit” billion-euro loss forecast on March 17. Nine-month sales
by the car-manufacturing unit rose 12 percent to 5.2 billion
euros, while the operating profit was 600 million euros.  
 “These are good numbers,” said  Daniel Schwarz , an analyst
at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt who has a “reduce”
 recommendation  on the stock. “The Panamera is proving a boon to
Porsche’s car business. They’re doing better than expected.”  
 The company, which took a majority stake in  Volkswagen AG 
in January 2009, posted its first  net loss  since 1994 last year
because of writedowns on the value of options on shares of
Europe’s biggest carmaker following a failed hostile takeover.
Volkswagen turned around and acquired 49.9 percent of Stuttgart,
Germany-based Porsche’s carmaking business in December.  
 Porsche  rose  as much as 1.04 euros, or 3 percent, to 35.64
euros and was up 2.1 percent as of 11:58 a.m. in Frankfurt
trading, valuing the carmaker at 6.2 billion euros.  
 Nine-month deliveries declined 0.1 percent from a year
earlier to 53,605 cars and sport-utility vehicles, Porsche said.
The company sold 13,906 Panameras in the period. The model,
Porsche’s latest and its first car with four doors, cost
1 billion euros to develop and went on sale in Germany last
September. Porsche has a fiscal-2010 target of selling 20,000
Panameras, which is priced starting at 94,600 euros.  
 ‘Major Asset’  
 “The Panamera is proving a major asset for Porsche in
difficult times,” said  Frank Biller , a Stuttgart-based analyst
with Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg who recommends buying the
carmaker’s stock.  
 Deliveries of the 911 plunged 35 percent to 13,137 cars and
Cayenne sales fell 23 percent to 18,932 SUVs.  
 The carmaker is sticking to a plan for full-year deliveries
to beat the 75,238 vehicles sold last year as a new version of
the Cayenne, Porsche’s best-selling model, and a six-cylinder
Panamera reach showrooms, according to  Albrecht Bamler , a
spokesman.  
 Porsche aims to double annual sales to as many as 150,000
vehicles over the medium term, benefiting from savings from the
combination with VW.  
 Debt Declines  
 The after-tax loss for the nine months through April 30 was
about 700 million euros, compared with profit of 4.2 billion
euros a year earlier, Porsche said.  
 Net  debt  as of April 30 fell to 6 billion euros from 6.1
billion euros on Jan. 31, Porsche said. The figure was reduced
because of cash received when VW paid 3.9 billion euros for a
49.9 percent stake in the Porsche AG carmaking unit as part of
the merger due to be completed by 2011, it said. Porsche owns
50.7 percent of Volkswagen’s ordinary shares.  
 The company is planning a capital increase of about
5 billion euros in the first half of 2011. The manufacturer
reiterated today that it’s seeking a minimum 2.5 billion euros
in the first phase as the controlling Porsche and Piech
families, who hold all of the common stock that carries voting
rights, buy the new shares.
