             Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd
indicated he may call an election late this year, three years
after winning office, and expects further “whacking” in
opinion polls because of his planned tax on resources companies.  
 “We have an election due by whenever it is, March or April
next year, and we only have three-year terms,” Rudd told the
Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s “7:30 Report” last night.
“You’ve got to use that time effectively.”  
 Rudd’s Labor Party won an election on Nov. 24, 2007, and
the next vote must be called before April 2011. Labor trailed
the Liberal-National coalition in a Nielsen poll published in
the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on June 7, the first time
the opposition has held the lead in four years.  
 “I expect that we’re going to continue to take a whacking
in the polls for some little time to come yet,” Rudd said.  
 The government’s support has fallen since it abandoned in
April its plan to combat climate change, which included an
emissions-trading program, and because of the proposed 40
percent tax on profits from companies like  BHP  Billiton Ltd. and
Rio Tinto  Group.  The levy will jeopardize investment and limit
jobs growth, resources companies say.  
 “If the government serves the full term, that means an
election in November,” Greens Party leader  Bob Brown  told
reporters in Canberra today. Asked whether Rudd would call a
vote as late as March or April he said: “I don’t think the PM
would extend the agony that far.”  
 The resource tax is forecast to earn A$12 billion ($10.4
billion) in the first two years and is due to start in 2012. The
government is spending A$38.5 million to counter an advertising
campaign by the Minerals Council of Australia and companies like
BHP warning about the dangers of the levy.  
 ‘Hard Fight’  
 The government is “engaged in a very hard fight with
various parts of the mining industry,” Rudd said. “We believe
that within the mining industry we need to move to a system
which taxes profits rather than production.”  
 “We’re also up against a forensic campaign being launched
by a very profitable industry in this country which doesn’t want
to see change,” Rudd said.  
 The Australian Parliament meets next week and isn’t due to
reconvene until Aug. 24. Rudd must ask Governor-General Quentin
Bryce to dissolve the assembly before an election and the
campaign usually lasts six weeks.
