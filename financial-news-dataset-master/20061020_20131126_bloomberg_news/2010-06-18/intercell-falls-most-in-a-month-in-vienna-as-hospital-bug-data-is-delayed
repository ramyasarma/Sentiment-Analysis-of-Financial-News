             Intercell AG , an Austrian vaccine
maker, fell the most in more than a month in Vienna trading
after saying that early data on whether its vaccine against a
deadly hospital bug works may be delayed to the first or second
quarter of 2011.  
 Intercell fell as much as 6 percent and was trading down
5.4 percent at 16.70 euros at 2:54 p.m. in Vienna, heading for 
its biggest decline since May 7.   
 “The study is being conducted by Merck & Co., who we
partner with on this vaccine, so we can’t really influence when
it will be completed,” Gerald Strohmaier, a spokesman for
Intercell, said by telephone today. The Vienna-based company on
May 11 said it expected the interim analysis of the vaccine
against Staphylococcus aureus “during the course of 2010.”
