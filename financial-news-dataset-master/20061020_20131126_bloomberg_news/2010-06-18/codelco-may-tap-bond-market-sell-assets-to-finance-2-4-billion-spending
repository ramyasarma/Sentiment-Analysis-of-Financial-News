             Codelco, the world’s biggest copper
producer, said it will probably tap bond markets this year to
finance investments after Chile’s government opted not to
reinvest the state-owned company’s profit.  
 Codelco will “most likely” sell bonds and may offload
assets to fund part of a $2.4 billion investment program this
year, Chairman  Gerardo Jofre  said in an interview late yesterday
in Santiago while attending an event.  
 The company, which supplies about 10 percent of the world’s
mined copper, needs to fund a $15 billion investment program
over the next five years. The Chilean government is seeking to
raise $8.4 billion to help pay for the reconstruction of
infrastructure damaged in February’s 8.8-magnitude earthquake.  
 Codelco’s finance needs “are going to be less than we
thought,” Mining Minister  Laurence Golborne  also said in an
interview at the same Santiago event. It has the means to
finance its own investments, and the government won’t reinvest
the company’s 2009 profit, he said.  
 The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to buy
Codelco’s $500 million 4.75 percent bonds due in October 2014
instead of U.S. Treasury bonds was unchanged at 114 basis points
today, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg, matching the
tightest spread in a month.  
 Codelco CEO  
 Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez , who took the top
spot last month after serving as head of BHP Billiton Ltd.’s
base metals division, said June 2 Codelco may raise $600 million
to $800 million selling its 40 percent stake in power company E-
CL SA within the next 18 months. The company last year made
record investments in its aging mines after four years of
declining production.  
 “Codelco doesn’t have any financing problems,” Chairman
Jofre, a former banking executive appointed to the post last
month, said yesterday in the interview.  
 Moody’s Investors Service yesterday reiterated Codelco’s A1
rating on $2.7 billion of long-term bonds, while changing its
outlook to stable from positive because of its investment
requirements.  
 “Given our expectations for increased debt to support
these strategic growth initiatives over time, and creeping
upward cost trend in line with the industry as a whole, the A1
foreign currency rating better reflects the potential for
anticipated moderation in debt protection metrics,” Moody’s
wrote in a statement.
