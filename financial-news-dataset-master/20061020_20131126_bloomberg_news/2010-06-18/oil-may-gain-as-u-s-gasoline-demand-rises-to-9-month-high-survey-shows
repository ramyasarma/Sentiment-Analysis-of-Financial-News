             Oil may rise next week after
U.S. gasoline consumption climbed to a nine-month high, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Eleven of 21 analysts, or 52 percent, forecast crude will
advance through June 25. Six respondents, or 29 percent,
predicted that it will be little changed and four saw a decline.
Last week, 42 percent of analysts said there would be a gain.  
 Gasoline  demand  climbed 1.6 percent to 9.34 million barrels
a day last week, the highest level since August, an Energy
Department report on June 16 showed. U.S. consumption of the
motor fuel peaks from the Memorial Day weekend in late May to
Labor Day in early September.  
 “The bias for prices in the short term and longer term is
upward,” said  Toby Hassall , a research analyst with CWA Global
Markets Ltd. in Sydney. “We’ve got the peak gasoline consumption
season, which has kicked off already, so there are some seasonal
issues to take into account as well.”  
 U.S. gasoline demand at the pump rose last week as prices
fell, according to MasterCard Inc. Motorists bought an average
9.276 million barrels of motor fuel a day in the week ended June
11, the second-biggest payments network company said in its
SpendingPulse report on June 15.  
 Crude oil for July delivery has increased $3.01, or 4.1
percent, to $76.79 a barrel so far this week on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 8.1 percent from a year ago.  
 The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 48 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  

 
     Bloomberg’s survey of oil analysts and traders, conducted
each Thursday, asks for an assessment of whether crude oil
futures are likely to rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming
week. The results were:

                    RISE      NEUTRAL    FALL
                     11          6        4
