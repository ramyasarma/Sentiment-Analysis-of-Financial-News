             German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government won’t compel banks to agree to the publication of so-
called stress tests, relying on market pressure for transparency
to achieve the same result.  
 Under current German law, banks can refuse publication of
the results of stress tests and the government has no plans to
amend the law, Berlin-based Finance Ministry spokesman  Michael Offer  said today in an e-mail.  
 The government is asking banks if they are willing to have
the results published and “if not, no publication,” Offer
said. Neither will the government make public which banks have
refused to comply, he said. All the same, “there’s such high
pressure for publication because  the markets  see who has
published and who hasn’t,” Offer said.  
 European Union leaders yesterday decided to publish the
results of stress tests on the region’s lenders, rejecting the
concerns of banking lobbies and executives including Deutsche
Bank AG Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  that publishing
the tests could undermine confidence in the banks unless
governments promise aid. Merkel said the step was important to
give “maximum transparency.”  
 At an earlier government press briefing in Berlin today,
Offer said that the government was reviewing the legal rules for
publishing bank stress tests. Critics of publication seemed to
be “rowing back,” he said.
