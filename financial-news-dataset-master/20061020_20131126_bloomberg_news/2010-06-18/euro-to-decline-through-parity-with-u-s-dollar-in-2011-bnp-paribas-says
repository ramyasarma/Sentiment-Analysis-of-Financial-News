             The euro will trade on a one-for-one
basis with the U.S. dollar in the first three months of next
year as Europe works to recover from its sovereign-debt crisis,
according to BNP Paribas.  
 The shared currency will “drift” to 97 U.S. cents in the
third quarter of 2011 and end the year at parity as “a weak
euro will help Europe generate the required income to deal with
the financial consequences of the crisis,” BNP said in a note
to clients. Previously the bank forecast a “gradual rebound”
in the euro in the first quarter, according to the note.  
 “The euro recovery now appears to be running out of steam
with the continued reassurances from European policy makers
regarding the stability of the euro zone providing little
comfort,” BNP wrote.  
 The euro, trading at $1.2366 at 11:47 a.m. in New York, has
gained as much as 4.6 percent since touching a four-year low of
$1.1877 on June 7.  
 Federal Reserve data showing an increase in central bank
holdings of U.S. Treasuries signal reserve diversification is
slowing, BNP said. The Fed’s  custodial holdings  of Treasuries
for overseas accounts including foreign central banks reached an
all-time high of $2.28 trillion in May.  
 “This also suggests that the current rebound in euro/
dollar is not backed by real money investment flows, implying
that gains are likely to be short-lived,” BNP said.
