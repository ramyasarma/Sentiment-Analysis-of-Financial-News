             Turkey plans to stage further short 
military incursions into neighboring Iraq if it’s necessary for
the country’s conflict with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or 
PKK, Hurriyet newspaper reported.  
 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and chief general Ilker
Basbug took the decision at a meeting in Ankara, the newspaper 
said, without saying how it got the information.  
 Turkish troops crossed about 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) into 
northern Iraq last week in pursuit of PKK gunmen, Hurriyet said.  
 Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union classify the PKK as
a terrorist group. The group has been fighting the Turkish 
state
since 1984 in a conflict that has killed some 40,000 people.
