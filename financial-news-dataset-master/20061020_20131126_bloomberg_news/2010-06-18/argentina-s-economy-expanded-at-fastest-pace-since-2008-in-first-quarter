             Argentina’s economy  expanded  at the
fastest annual pace since 2008 in the first quarter, led by an
increase in domestic consumption and investment.  
 Gross domestic product grew 6.8 percent from a year earlier
and 3 percent from the last three months of 2009, the National
Statistics Institute said.  
 The economy, South America’s second largest after Brazil,
is recovering from a slump that reduced growth to 0.9 percent
last year, the slowest rate since Argentina pulled out of a
recession in 2003. President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  last
month announced an 8 billion peso ($2 billion) loan program for
companies to help them boost production and exports.  
 “The economy is now experiencing a solid cyclical
rebound,”  Alberto Ramos , an economist at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., wrote in an e-mailed statement. “We expect to see a
visible deceleration during 2011 as the current real business
cycle expansion is being fueled by unsustainable and
distortionary macro and micro polices.”  
 Ramos said he forecasts the economy will expand 5 percent
to 6 percent this year.  
 Consumption rose 7.3 percent in the first quarter and
investment increased 13.1 percent, the report said.  Industrial
output  rose 10.2 percent in May from a year earlier and 0.2
percent from April, the statistics agency reported.
