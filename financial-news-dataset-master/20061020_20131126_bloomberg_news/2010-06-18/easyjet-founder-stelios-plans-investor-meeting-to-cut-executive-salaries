             EasyJet Plc founder  Stelios Haji- Ioannou  said he’ll call an emergency meeting of the discount
airline’s shareholders to challenge executive pay levels in the
latest step in a campaign against the board’s spending policies.  
 With Chief Executive Officer  Andy Harrison  departing on
June 30, Stelios, who prefers to be known by his first name,
aims to make executive compensation “a central topic for the
next two or three months” as he lobbies EasyJet to pay its
first-ever dividend, he said today in an interview.  
 The entrepreneur, who still controls about 38 percent of
the company stock but has no management control, resigned from
the EasyJet board on May 14 in a bid to force the carrier to
curb its expansion plans and return earnings to shareholders.  
 “Harrison has been saying Stelios wants one thing and that
62 percent of the shareholders want something else, so let’s put
it to a vote and see how many people support these bonuses,”
the 43-year-old said in an interview.  
 The meeting would also be used to challenge the composition
of EasyJet’s board with the aim of voting off a non-executive
director, said Stelios, who has been at loggerheads with the
airline for almost two years.  
 ‘Difficult Questions’  
 “The time has come to ask the difficult questions about
the fleet size,” he said. “Do we need all these aircraft? We
should go for profit-margin improvement, not passenger growth.”  
 Luton, England-based EasyJet, Europe’s second-biggest low-
cost carrier after  Ryanair Holdings Plc , said today in a
statement that it hasn’t been contacted by Stelios, adding that
he himself had helped set compensation levels before resigning.  
 “The company regrets this strategy of intimidation with
the objective of getting a cash return,” EasyJet said. “We are
happy with the board structure and the remuneration policy,
which we think appropriately incentivizes management.”  
 Stelios’s EasyGroup IP Licensing Ltd. is also engaged in a
court action with EasyJet in which it is alleged that the
carrier has gone beyond the terms of a branding agreement by
offering non-airline services using the “Easy” name.  
 Carolyn McCall , currently CEO of Guardian Media Group Plc,
will take over from Harrison in July, EasyJet said on March 24.
