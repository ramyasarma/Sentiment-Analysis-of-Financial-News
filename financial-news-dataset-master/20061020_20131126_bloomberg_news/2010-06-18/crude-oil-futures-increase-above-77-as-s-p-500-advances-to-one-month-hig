             Crude oil rose above $77 a barrel as
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased to the highest level
in a month and the dollar pared its gains against the euro.  
 Oil advanced for a second week, along with equities. The
S&P 500 climbed amid volatility related to stock futures and
options expiration. The dollar retreated after touching a three-
week high against the euro, bolstering the appeal of commodities
as an alternative investment.  
 “We’re following the stock market and we’re following the
dollar,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest
in Chicago. “Oil has no personality of its own today. It’s just
going to follow what everybody else does.”  
 Crude oil for July delivery gained 39 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $77.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices have risen 8.1 percent in the past year. They
increased 4.6 percent this week, the most in three weeks.  
 The  S&P 500  rose 1.47 points to 1,117.51, and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 16.47 points to 10,450.64. Both closed
at the highest level since May 18.  
 The dollar increased 0.2 percent against the euro to
$1.2364 from $1.2389 yesterday in New York. It touched $1.2417,
the highest level since May 28.  
 Price fluctuations throughout the financial markets were
bigger than usual today because of so-called quadruple witching,
or the quarterly expiration of stock index futures, options on
index futures, stock options and stock futures. Quadruple
witching occurs once every three months.  
 Drilling Moratorium  
 Tighter regulation of offshore rigs prompted by the BP Plc
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may delay exploration projects
and trim global output by as much as 900,000 barrels a day if a
moratorium on deep-water drilling spreads beyond the U.S.,  Nobuo Tanaka , executive director of the International Energy Agency,
said today in Fukui, Japan.  
 Total SA  Chief Executive Officer  Christophe de Margerie 
said today that the world needs the oil that can be produced
from deep-water fields, so a lasting reduction in supply is
unlikely.  
 “We’ll have to make sure this doesn’t happen again, but
this oil needs to be produced,” he told Bloomberg Television at
the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Russia. “The
world is needing it so I don’t think it will have long-term
impact.”  
 Price Rebound  
 Crude oil may extend a two-week rebound in New York with
prices ending this week above a Fibonacci level at $75.70 a
barrel, according to technical analysis by Petromatrix GmbH.  
 That corresponds to the half-way point in crude’s move this
year from a peak of $87.15 a barrel on May 3 to a low of $64.24
on May 20.  
 Oil may rise next week after U.S. demand climbed 1.6
percent to 9.34 million barrels a day last week, a Bloomberg
News survey showed. Eleven of 21 analysts, or 52 percent,
forecast crude will increase through June 25. Six respondents,
or 29 percent, predicted futures will be little changed and four
said prices will decline. Last week, 42 percent of analysts said
the market would gain.  
 Oil fell 1.1 percent yesterday after the Labor Department
reported initial jobless  applications  in the U.S. climbed by
12,000 to 472,000 in the week ended June 12, a one-month high.
U.S. housing starts  fell  10 percent in May, the biggest drop
since March 2009, the Commerce Department reported June 16.  
 Economy  
 “The fact that the economic indicators have not been good,
the unemployment numbers and housing, hasn’t been making people
feel good, especially after a $7 to $8 run-up in prices,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester, Massachusetts.  
 Oil on the Nymex surged 8.7 percent between June 7 and June
16 as the euro advanced, refiners cut operating rates and fuel
demand was forecast to climb during the peak driving season in
the U.S.  
 Gasoline consumption declined in May to the lowest level
for the month since 2003, according to a report today by the
American Petroleum Institute. Deliveries of gasoline, a measure
of demand, averaged 9.05 million barrels a day, down from 9.09
million in May 2009. Consumption averaged 0.5 percent lower in
the first five months of 2010 from the year earlier.  
 “Demand seems to have hit a wall in terms of growing any
faster,” said  Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory
company Cameron Hanover Inc. in New Canaan, Connecticut.  
 Gasoline for July delivery lost 1.64 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $2.1476 a gallon on the Nymex. Heating oil for July delivery
retreated 1.85 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.1289 a gallon.  
 Brent crude for August settlement dropped 46 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $78.22 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 414,033
contracts as of 3:24 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 772,281
contracts yesterday, 1.5 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.3 million contracts.
