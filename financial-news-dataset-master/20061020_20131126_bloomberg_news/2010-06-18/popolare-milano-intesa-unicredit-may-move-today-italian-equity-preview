             Italy’s FTSE MIB Index rose for a
second day, gaining 183.40, or 0.9 percent, to 20,752.31 in
Milan. The gauge surged 5.6 percent this week, the biggest
weekly advance in more than three months.  
 Options and futures on indexes expire today in Europe, an
event that caused unusual market movements and trading volumes.  
 The following stocks were among the most active on the
Italian market today.  
 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  (BMPS IM) rose for the
first session in three, increasing 4.85 cents, or 5.1 percent,
to 1.01 after EU leaders yesterday agreed to publish the results
of stress tests on banks.  The Bank of Italy will publish the
results of stress tests of the nation’s banks so the public can
know the financial strength of their lenders and investors may
better understand what they are buying, the central bank’s
governor, Mario Draghi, said today.  
 Separately, HSBC Holdings Plc lifted its recommendation on
the stock to “overweight” from “neutral.”  
 The brokerage also upgraded to “overweight” from
“neutral” Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl (PMI IM) and  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM). Shares of Popolare di Milano advanced 6
percent to 3.79 euros. Intesa gained 9.25 cents, or 4 percent,
to 2.4 euros, ending a two-day loss.  
 Banco Popolare SC  (BP IM), which remains an “overweight”
at HSBC, climbed 17.25 cents, or 3.7 percent, to 4.82 euros.  
 Fiat SpA  (F IM) gained for a second day, rising 17.5 cents,
or 1.9 percent, to 9.46 euros. Equita Sim SpA kept a “buy”
rating on the Italian carmaker, saying that “Fiat management’s
forecast of the 2010 Brazilian market is rather conservative for
both light commercial vehicles and trucks.”  
 Mediaset SpA  (MS IM) retreated 5 cents, or 1 percent, to
4.95 euros, a second loss this week. Italy’s biggest private
television broadcaster had its price estimate cut to 5.3 euros
from 6.2 euros at UBS AG. The brokerage kept a “neutral”
rating.  
 Milano Assicurazioni SpA  (MI IM) climbed 7.3 cents, or 4.9
percent, to 1.56 euros, the highest in more than a month. Gruppo
Banca Leonardo reiterated a “buy” rating on the stock after
Popolare di Milano completed the acquisition of a 51 percent
stake in Bipiemme Vita from Fondiaria-Sai SpA’s Milano
Assicurazioni for 113 million euros.  
 Saipem SpA  (SPM IM) gained 55 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
26.91 euros, a fourth increase this week. Morgan Stanley lifted
its price estimate on Europe’s largest oilfield-services
provider to 35 euros from 34 euros. The brokerage kept an
“overweight” rating.  
 Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA  (UNI IM) rose 2.35 cents, or
3.4 percent, to 71.3 cents. Italy’s third-largest insurer will
sell new shares at 36 percent less than yesterday’s closing
price in a planned rights offer to boost capital, the company
said in a statement distributed by the Italian stock exchange
late yesterday. Cheuvreux kept an “underperform” rating,
saying Unipol is “too expensive.”
