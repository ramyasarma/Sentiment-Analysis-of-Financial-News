             Solar Millennium AG  climbed as much
as 17 percent in German trading after the builder of solar-
thermal power plants said a special review by Deloitte dispelled
doubts about its accounting procedures.  
 The shares rose as high as 21.84 euros ($27.08), its best
intraday level in seven weeks, and traded at 21.45 euros, up 15
percent, at 10:33 a.m. in Frankfurt. The Erlangen, Germany-based
company released a summary of the findings today in a statement.  
 Solar Millennium shares dropped after its accounting
practices were questioned in a series of media reports this
year. The company responded by hiring Deloitte to review the
consolidation practices it used relating to the corporate IFRS
financial statements for the last five fiscal years.  
 The report largely endorses methods the company used, Solar
Millennium said in the statement.
