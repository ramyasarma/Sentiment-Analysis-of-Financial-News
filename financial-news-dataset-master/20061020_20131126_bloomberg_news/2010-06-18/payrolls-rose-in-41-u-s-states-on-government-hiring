             Payrolls increased in 41 U.S. states
in May, led by a surge in government hiring that probably
reflected temporary workers to conduct the decennial census.  
 Excluding government agencies, employment would have
dropped in three of the five states showing the biggest gains in
payrolls, including California, Florida and New York. Hiring in
Texas, where a 43,600 increase in jobs led all states, was paced
by gains in professional and business services, tourism and
manufacturing.  
 The government took on 411,000 employees for the 2010
census, propelling payrolls up by 431,000 last month nationally,
according to Labor Department figures issued earlier this month.
Private payrolls rose a less-than-forecast 41,000, and the
 jobless rate  dropped to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent as
discouraged jobseekers left the labor force.  
 “The bulk of the employment growth in May was because of
the census, but it comes after very strong data for April,”
said  Jim O’Sullivan , chief economist at MF Global Ltd. in New
York. “The momentum has been positive. Employment growth is key
to a self-sustaining recovery.”  
 Unemployment decreased in 37 states in May, led by declines
of 0.5 percentage-point in North and South Carolina, and 0.4
percentage-point in Illinois and Michigan. It was the first time
since April 2006 that Michigan, with a jobless rate of 13.6
percent, didn’t top the unemployment rankings.  
 Automaker Hiring  
 Automaker Chrysler Group LLC, controlled by Fiat SpA and
based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, said in May that it will hire
1,100 workers at a Detroit factory that produces Jeep Grand
Cherokees and add a second shift.  
 The jobless rate in Nevada climbed to 14 percent in May,
the highest since records began in 1976, from 13.7 percent the
prior month, surpassing Michigan as the state with the most
unemployment in the U.S. The states with the next-highest rates
of unemployment after Nevada and Michigan were California, at
12.4 percent, and Rhode Island, at 12.3 percent.  
 California’s payrolls increased by 28,300 as government
hiring surged by 30,000. Employment in Florida grew by 20,300 as
the government took on 32,100, and jobs in New York climbed by
21,000, thanks to a 30,500 gain at government agencies.  
 Virginia rounded out the top five states with the biggest
employment gains, showing a 20,300 increase. Almost half, 9,300,
was attributed to government agencies. In Texas, government
payrolls fell by 1,100.  
 New York  
 The jobless rate in New York declined to 8.3 percent, the
lowest since April 2009. Unemployment in New York City fell to
9.6 percent last month, the fifth consecutive drop. The addition
of 14,700 jobs brought the rate down from 9.8 percent in April.  
 Unemployment in New Jersey fell to a nine-month low of 9.7
percent in May, matching the nation’s jobless rate, from 9.8
percent in April. Connecticut’s unemployment rate decreased to
8.9 percent from 9 percent.  
 State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to
the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.  
 Today’s report showed 16 states had unemployment of 10
percent or higher, the same as in April.  
 Elevated unemployment and sluggish consumer spending are
reducing tax collections, worsening the revenue shortfalls for
state governments. The budget deficits in turn may force
municipalities to make their own staff reductions.  
 Newark , New Jersey’s largest city, plans to fire hundreds
of workers and seek concessions from unionized employees to help
close a $180 million budget deficit, Mayor  Cory Booker  said
today.
