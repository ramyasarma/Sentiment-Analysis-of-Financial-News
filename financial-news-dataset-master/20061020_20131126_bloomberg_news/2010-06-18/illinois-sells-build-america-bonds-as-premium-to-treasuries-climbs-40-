             Illinois  sold $300 million of Build
America Bonds at a yield premium over Treasuries about 40
percent higher than two months ago after lawmakers failed to
close a $13 billion budget deficit for the year starting July 1.  
 The fifth most-populous U.S. state sold the taxable debt
maturing in 2035 priced to yield 7.1 percent yesterday, or 297
basis points over the  2040 Treasury  to which it was benchmarked,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Illinois offered Build
Americas of similar maturity at spreads of 205 basis points and
210 basis points in two April issues, Bloomberg data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Risk aversion among investors amid Greece’s efforts to
impose austerity measures contributed to swell the state’s
borrowing costs, said  Tom Boylen , a managing director and
municipal-bond trader in Chicago for BMO Capital Markets.  
 “A lot of this is a global thing,” Boylen said. “There’s
a bigger magnifying glass on credit.”  
 Illinois lawmakers passed a provisional $25.9 billion
fiscal 2011 budget that’s about $13 billion short, and are
resisting  Governor Pat Quinn’s  plan to sell $3.7 billion in debt
to make a pension payment and help bridge the gap. Legislators
recessed last month without covering the pension obligation and
$4.5 billion in unpaid bills.  
 Citigroup Inc.  provided the winning bid for the Illinois
sale, which will finance capital projects.  Alex Samuelson , a
spokesman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment.
 Kelly Kraft , a spokeswoman for Quinn, didn’t immediately reply
to telephone or e-mail messages requesting comment on the Build
America sale.  
 Default Insurance  
 The sale took place as the price of insuring Illinois bonds
against default climbed to a record. The cost of a five-year
credit-default swap to protect Illinois debt rose 7 basis points
to 309.1 basis points, or $309,100 to insure $10 million of
debt, according to CMA DataVision, a data provider owned by  CME
Group Inc.  The Markit MCDX CDS index of 50 municipal issuers
held close to an 11-month high.  
 Illinois’s credit-swap costs surpassed  California’ s, the
largest U.S. municipal borrower, which saw its default-insurance
contracts rise 1 basis point to 299.6 basis points from 298.7
basis points yesterday. Illinois is rated A+ by Standard &
Poor’s, two levels higher than California. Moody’s Investors
Service puts both at A1, the fifth-highest, and the lowest-rated
among U.S. states.  
 “If the spread is the widest, it says the problem is
bigger than it’s ever been before,” said  Peter Hayes , who
oversees $106 billion of municipal bonds for New York-based
BlackRock Inc. “It’s a reaction to the inability to pass a
budget. We’ve seen a greater unwillingness from Illinois and the
market is reacting to that.”  
 Moody’s, Fitch Downgrades  
 Moody’s and Fitch Ratings downgraded Illinois this month,
citing the lack of political will to deal with budget issues.
Moody’s also cited strengths including a diverse economy and
changed the outlook to stable from negative.  
 Illinois plans to sell $900 million more in Build America
securities later this month. The bonds, created as part of last
year’s economic-stimulus measures, are the fastest-growing part
of the $2.8 trillion municipal-debt market. States and local
governments have sold almost $113 billion of the obligations,
according to Bloomberg data. Build America issuers are eligible
for a 35 percent federal subsidy on their interest costs.
