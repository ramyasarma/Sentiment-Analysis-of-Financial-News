             Taiwan’s dollar rose, headed for its
biggest weekly gain in nine months, as the prospect of a trade
deal with China and an improving economy spur inflows to the
stock market.  
 The currency strengthened the most this month after
overseas investors bought $921 million more of the island’s
shares than they sold this week through yesterday, their first
net purchases since April. Taiwan’s economy grew at the fastest
pace in more than 30 years in the last quarter and China’s
government said June 13 a basic agreement has been reached with
the island on goods, services and industries chosen for initial
tariff cuts in a planned trade deal.  
 “Funds are flowing back as investors seek riskier
assets,” said Tigr Cheng, a strategist at Polaris Securities Co.
in Taipei. “People have been upbeat about the economy.”  
 The local dollar climbed 0.4 percent to NT$32.186 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 10:23 a.m. local time, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It strengthened 0.8 percent this week.  
 Taiwan’s gross domestic product increased 13 percent in the
three months to March 31 from a year earlier, the most since
1978. Reports next week will show export orders rose 37 percent
from a year earlier in May and the jobless rate fell to 5.33
percent, the lowest since 2008, according to the median
estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The yield on the 1.375 percent bond maturing March 2020 was
little changed at 1.46 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market, Taiwan’s biggest exchange for bonds. Its price climbed
0.036 or NT$36 per NT$100,000 face amount, to 99.2691. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.
