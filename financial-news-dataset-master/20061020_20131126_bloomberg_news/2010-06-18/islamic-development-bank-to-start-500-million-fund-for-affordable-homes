             The Saudi Arabian-based Islamic
Development Bank plans to start a $500 million fund to provide
financing for developers of affordable houses in Muslim
countries, an executive at the bank said in an interview.  
 Khalid al-Aboodi , chief executive officer of the Islamic
Development Bank’s Islamic Corp. for the Development of the
Private Sector, said the fund would be started in the third
quarter and by the end of the year at the latest.  
 The fund will invest only in the 56 member-countries of the
Islamic Development Bank. In early stages the fund will invest
in 10 countries, and later it will expand into the rest of the
bank’s membership, he added.  
 Al-Aboodi didn’t specify which countries but said they are
distributed between the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia.  
 “We have chosen the 10 countries carefully and we already
identified a couple of projects that we will invest in,” he
added. “Once the fund is announced, work in the projects will
commence.”  
 Islamic Corp., known as ICD, is the seed-investor of the
fund and it will contribute a small portion of its capital. The
rest will be gathered from private investors and governments,
Al-Aboodi said.  
 “This fund will only invest in affordable housing. We have
no intention to finance other type of real-estate projects,” he
added.
