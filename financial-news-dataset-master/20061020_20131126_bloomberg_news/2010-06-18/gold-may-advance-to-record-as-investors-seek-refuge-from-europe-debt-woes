             Gold, little changed, traded near a
record as investors took refuge in the precious metal to protect
their wealth from Europe’s financial turbulence.  
 Bullion for immediate delivery swung between a 0.3 percent
gain and a 0.3 percent loss before trading at $1,244.50 an ounce
at 12:11 p.m. in Singapore. The metal jumped as much as 1.8
percent to $1,251.25 yesterday, near an all-time high of
$1,252.11 on June 8.  
 “We are still very bullish on gold,” said  Hwang Il Doo , a
senior trader with KEB Futures Co. in Seoul. “Gold will remain
the main beneficiary of what’s happening in Europe unless the
picture takes a turn for the better.”  
 Gold has climbed 13 percent this year, outperforming stocks,
bonds and other commodities, as investors seek to safeguard
their wealth against the crisis in Greece and other European
countries struggling to repay debt.  
 Holdings in exchange-traded funds backed by bullion reached
records, keeping the precious metal on course for a 10th annual
gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920. Gold
denominated in euros, U.K. pounds and Swiss francs has climbed
to records this year.  
 Spot gold has climbed 1.4 percent this week, heading for
its fourth consecutive weekly advance. Gold futures for August
delivery in New York fell 0.3 percent to $1,245.30, paring its
weekly gain to 1.2 percent.  
 “The overall gain in the gold price for today is likely to
be muted,” said Ong Yi Ling, Singapore-based analyst with
Phillip Futures Pte Ltd. “Ahead of the weekend, traders will be
tempted to lock-in profits and close off long positions and this
is likely to exert downward pressure on gold.”  
 ‘Healthy Shape’  
 Eighteen of 20 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 90 percent, said bullion would rise next week.
None forecast lower prices and two were neutral.  
 The euro has slumped 13 percent against the dollar this
year, while the  MSCI World Index  of shares has dropped 4.6
percent. The LME Index of six industrial metals slumped 12
percent on concern that debt-cutting measures by European
nations will slow growth in the global economy.  
 European policy makers must rein in their budget deficits
and publish stress tests on banks because the financial package
designed to fight the region’s debt crisis only buys them time,
World Bank President  Robert Zoellick  said yesterday.  
 “Gold is in very healthy shape,” said  Wallace Ng , Hong
Kong-based executive director with Fortis Nederland NV. “Gold
prices are well positioned to make new highs.”  
 China Reserves  
 China should increase its holdings of precious metals and
oil as it invests its foreign reserves, Yin Zhongqing, vice
chairman of the finance committee of National People’s Congress,
said at a conference in Shanghai today.  
 The Asian nation should reduce overseas debt holdings and
increase equity investments, Yin said. Gold accounts for 1.6
percent of the reserves held by the People’s Bank of China,
according to the World Gold Council. The country had increased
its reserves by 454 tons to 1,054 tons since 2003, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said in April 2009.  
 Assets in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, increased 1.83 metric tons to a record
1,307.96 tons yesterday, according to figures on the company’s
website. Gold will average $1,190 an ounce this year, up from a
previous forecast of $1,150, BNP Paribas SA said this week. It
averaged $973.67 in 2009.  
 Silver for immediate delivery increased 0.3 percent to
$18.765 an ounce and palladium fell 0.4 percent to $480.05 an
ounce, while platinum was little changed at $1,577.10 an ounce.
