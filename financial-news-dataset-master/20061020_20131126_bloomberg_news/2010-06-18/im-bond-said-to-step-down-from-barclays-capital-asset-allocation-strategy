             Barclays Capital’s  Tim Bond  stepped
down as head of asset-allocation strategy and is considering his
options both within the bank and elsewhere, two people familiar
with his role said.  
 Bond, who is exploring roles outside the research
department at  Barclays,  has been with the London-based
investment bank since 1998. He left the research post a month
ago, the people said.  
 Barclays Capital declined to comment. Bond, who is based in
London, couldn’t immediately be contacted.
