             Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH ’s sex-
drive drug flibanserin doesn’t provide enough benefits to
outweigh its risks, according to a U.S. panel reviewing the
first pill designed to boost women’s libidos.  
 Outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration found
the drug’s side effects unacceptable in an 11-0 vote today in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. Earlier, the panel voted 10-1 that the
drug isn’t effective. While the FDA usually follows its advisory
panels’ recommendations, it isn’t required to do so.
