             Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. , the world’s largest lender by market value, may sell
25 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) of convertible bonds as soon as
August, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  
 ICBC won shareholder approval last month to sell notes to
shore up capital, and Chairman  Jiang Jianqing  said at the time
that the bank hadn’t decided terms for a sale.  
 The lender may sell convertible notes in September or
October, or may delay the sale until 2011, the 21st Century
Business Herald reported today, citing an underwriter it didn’t
identify.  
 A spokesman for ICBC declined to be identified or to
comment on the Beijing-based bank’s funding plans.
