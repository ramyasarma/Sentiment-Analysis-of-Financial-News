             African countries should look
for more trade deals with other developing nations instead
of relying on industrialized economies, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development said.  
 Trade between African nations and developing countries
outside the continent nearly tripled between 2004 and 2008
to $283 billion,  UNCTAD said in a report  on Africa’s
economic development released today said.  
 African nations don’t have a “clear plan” on managing
trade between the continent and countries such as China,
Brazil and India, said Janvier Nkurunziza, an UNCTAD
economist.  
 Other developing countries spend money on trade,
investment and infrastructure development and bring aid
that doesn’t come with conditions, Nkurunziza told
reporters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, yesterday.
