             Brazil’s gold jewelry demand may
rise more than 20 percent this year, London-based research
company GFMS Ltd. said in a report.  
 Economic growth of 9 percent in the first quarter and a
strong real against the dollar help to explain the jump, GFMS
Executive Chairman Philip Klapwijk wrote in the report. Brazil’s
consumption fell 10 percent last year to 27 metric tons, he
wrote.
