             England manager Fabio Capello
changed goalkeepers for tonight’s World Cup match against
Algeria, selecting David James in place of Robert Green, whose
blunder allowed the U.S. to tie the opening game.  
 James, 39, has played 51 times for England. The 30-year-old
Green’s miscue on a long shot from American Clint Dempsey in the
June 12 match left England tied for second place in Group C.
Earlier today, the U.S. drew 2-2 with group leader Slovenia. The
eastern Europeans have four points, the U.S. has two, England
has 1 and Algeria has none.
