             Refugees who fled fighting
between Pakistan’s army and Taliban militants in the tribal
region of South Waziristan will begin returning to their
homes in July, a regional official said.  
 The displaced will be registered by June 26 at five
locations, Shahab Ali Shah, the senior administrator for
South Waziristan, said by phone today. The decision to go
back to villages was taken by the refugees at a community
meeting, or jirga, held in Tank district yesterday, said
Saleh Shah Qureshi, a member of the Mehsud tribe.  
 Pakistan’s military launched an offensive against
Taliban guerrillas in South Waziristan in October,
triggering retaliatory bombings and gun attacks in major
Pakistani cities. It is under U.S. pressure to spread its
offensives to neighboring North Waziristan.  
 There are about 400,000 refugees from the Mehsud tribe
in the northwestern Pakistan towns of Dera Ismail Khan and
Tank, said Khalid Fayaz Khan, director of Fida, an aid
agency.
