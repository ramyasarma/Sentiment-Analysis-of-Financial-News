             Investor Mark Mobius said he’s
“positive” about Hungary’s long-term prospects as the
goverment is expected to continue working with the International
Monetary Fund to reduce debt and support its economy.  
 Mobius, the executive chairman of Templeton Asset
Management Ltd., also said signs of a slow recovery have become
“evident” in Hungary, whose government this month pledged to
meet its deficit target. The nation’s stocks and currency had
previously dropped after a spokesman for Prime Minister Viktor
Orban said the nation’s economy is in a “very grave situation”
and warned it’s not an exaggeration to talk about default.  
 Valuations have become “even more attractive” in the
market, Mobius said a posting dated June 17 on his blog.
