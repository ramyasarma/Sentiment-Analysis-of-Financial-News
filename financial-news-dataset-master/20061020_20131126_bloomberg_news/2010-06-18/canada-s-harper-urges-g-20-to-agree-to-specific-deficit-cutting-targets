             Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper , who hosts a summit of Group of 20 leaders next week,
said advanced countries should agree to specific deficit-
reduction targets at the meeting to ease investor concerns about
rising debt levels.  
 Harper, in a letter to his G-20 counterparts, said he wants
leaders to agree to a target of reducing their deficits by half
by 2013, and to stabilize or begin reducing their ratios of
debt-to-output by 2016, a spokesman for Harper said.  
 “Advanced countries must send a clear message that as
their stimulus plans expire they will focus on getting their
fiscal houses in order,”  Dimitri Soudas  cited the letter as
saying. “This requires credible plans for fiscal consolidation
to dispel the uncertainty and financial volatility that can
impair future growth prospects.”  
 The letter, which was sent yesterday, also urges G-20
leaders to “reaffirm” their plans to follow through on
existing stimulus plans because the recovery remains fragile.  
 “We are not out of the woods yet,” Soudas said, speaking
to reporters today in Ottawa. “The recovery in private demand
is not yet assured in all G-20 countries and new risks have
emerged.”  
 President  Barack Obama , in a separate letter dated June 16,
urged the G-20 to “safeguard and strengthen” the global
economic recovery with continued stimulus.  
 Harper also said the G-20 needs to agree on a “set of
policies” to sustain global growth, including financial sector
reform and steps to boost domestic demand in emerging markets,
such as allowing currencies to be more flexible.
