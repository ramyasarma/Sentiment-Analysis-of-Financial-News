             BP Plc’s  credit rating was cut three
levels by Moody’s Investors Service on concern that costs from
cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and meeting legal
liabilities may be higher than previously expected.  
 BP’s senior unsecured ratings were lowered to A2, the
sixth-highest investment grade, from Aa2, Moody’s said in a
statement today. The ratings remain under review for possible
downgrades.  
 “Moody’s updated assessment is that the spill will have a
sustained negative impact on the group’s free cash flow
generation and overall financial profile for a number of
years,” the rating company said in the statement.  
 Moody’s “cautions” that BP’s agreement to set up a $20
billion independent fund to pay victims of the disaster doesn’t
cap its potential liabilities. Fitch Ratings this week cut BP’s
rating to two levels above “junk” after U.S. lawmakers stepped
up pressure on the company to set aside funds. BP is canceling
three quarters of dividends, selling assets and reducing
investment to free up cash for victims of the spill, the worst
environmental disaster in U.S. history.  
 “The steps BP has taken are positive, but there are
growing pressures,” said  David Staples , a managing director at
Moody’s. “Substantial uncertainties remain as to what the costs
of the spill will be.”  
 BP pared gains after the latest downgrade, to trade 1.8
percent higher at 366 pence as of 1:15 p.m. in London. The
shares earlier rose by as much as 5.5 percent.
