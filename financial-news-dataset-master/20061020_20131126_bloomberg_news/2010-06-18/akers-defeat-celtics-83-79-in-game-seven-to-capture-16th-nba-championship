             The Los Angeles Lakers claimed their
16th National Basketball Association title with an 83-79 win
over the Boston Celtics in a decisive Game 7.   
 Kobe Bryant had 23 points and Ron Artest added 20 to lead
the Lakers to the victory at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.  
 The Lakers erased a 13-point second-half deficit to win
their second straight championship and avenge their NBA Finals
loss against the Celtics from two years ago.   
 With their 16th NBA title, the Lakers are within one of the
Celtics for the most in league history. The franchises have
combined to win 33 of a possible 64 championships.   
 It’s the fifth championship ring for Bryant, who pulls
within one of Michael Jordan’s total, and the 11th title for
Lakers coach Phil Jackson. The Lakers are the first team to win
back-to-back titles since Bryant teamed with Shaquille O’Neal
for three straight in Los Angeles from 2000-02.
