             India’s stocks fell for the first
time in eight days, led by Reliance Industries Ltd., as Chairman
 Mukesh Ambani  concluded a speech at a shareholders’ meeting
without his brother, eroding speculation the two had put aside a
five-year feud and would reconcile publicly.  
 Reliance Industries, India’s largest company by market
value, declined the most since June 7.  Reliance Infrastructure
Ltd. , controlled by younger brother Anil, fell the most in a
month.  
 “The falling stocks today are a knee-jerk reaction to all
the expectation that was being built upon a public display of
truce,” said  Taina Erajuuri , who helps manage the equivalent of
$1.2 billion of emerging market stocks at Helsinki-based Fim
Asset Management, including Reliance Industries’ shares.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
dropped 45.87, or 0.3 percent, to 17,570.82. The gauge has
climbed 3 percent this week, its biggest weekly advance in more
than three months.  
 The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange fell
0.2 percent to 5,262.60. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.4 percent
to 2,215.67.  
 Reliance  Industries lost 1.6 percent to 1,054.35 rupees.
The stock had risen as much as 1.7 percent before the
shareholders meeting started. Reliance Infrastructure fell 3
percent to 1,163.10 rupees.  
 Among other companies controlled by Anil,  Reliance Power
Ltd.  fell 3.6 percent,  Reliance Communications Ltd.  dropped 3.7
percent and Reliance Capital Ltd. dropped 3.9 percent.  Reliance
Natural Resources Ltd.  fell 7.4 percent, the most since May 7.  
 The shareholder meeting took place five years after the
Ambani brothers split the business group founded by their father,
initiating years of squabbles and lawsuits as their business
interests clashed. Indian newspapers had speculated about a
rapprochement since the brothers scrapped a non-competition
accord last month, removing curbs on investments.  
 Newspapers including Hindustan Times had reported that Anil
may attend the meeting, ending a feud that delayed investments
in roads, power and telecommunications ventures.  
 Larsen & Toubro , an engineering company, advanced as
investors bought shares of companies linked to the nation’s
demand. The nation’s economy can grow by as much as 10 percent
annually in coming years,  Chakravarthy Rangarajan , chairman of
the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said yesterday.  
 “If you look at the quality of stocks that investors have
been buying, it’s a play on the domestic growth story,” said
 Gajendra Nagpal , chief executive officer at Unicon Financial
Intermediaries Pvt. in New Delhi. “A correction will have
limited downside.”  
 Larsen & Toubro gained 1.2 percent to 1,798.50 rupees, its
highest close since Feb. 6, 2008. Tata Power advanced 0.7
percent to 1,270 rupees.  
 There’s a “clear signal” that India can achieve a
forecast annual gross domestic product growth rate of between 9
percent and 10 percent, Rangarajan said yesterday. That compares
with last year’s 7.4 percent pace. India in May said it plans to
set up a 500 billion rupee ($10.8 billion) debt fund to upgrade
infrastructure and fuel growth.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  8.58 billion rupees  of Indian
equities June 16, increasing total purchases of the stocks this
year to 249.7 billion rupees, according to the nation’s market
regulator.
