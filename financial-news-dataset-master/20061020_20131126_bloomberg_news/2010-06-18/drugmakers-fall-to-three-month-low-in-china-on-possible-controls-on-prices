             China’s drugmakers , the nation’s
best performing stocks in the past year, fell to the lowest in
almost three months today on speculation planned curbs on
medicine prices will hurt profits.  
 The National Development and Reform Commission will draw up
a plan to limit “substantial” gains in medicine prices and
curb profiteering, the planning agency said in a statement
posted on its website yesterday.  
 “Mounting evidence is pointing to a more stringent policy
for drug pricing,” BofA-Merrill Lynch Global Research analysts
 Shaojing Tong  and  Binnie Wong  said in a report sent to clients
today. “We caution investors of potential headline risks for
drug-related stocks, especially after their impressive
outperformance” in the first half, they wrote.  
 A measure of health-care stocks dropped 3.8 percent on the
CSI 300 Index at 11:30 a.m., the lowest since March 25 and the
steepest decline among the 10  industry groups . A four-day, 11
percent slide has erased the index’s gains for the year after a
94 percent rally in 2009.  
 China’s pharmaceuticals market, including nutritional
products and consumer drugs, will more than double to $110
billion by 2015 from $44 billion in 2008, Credit Suisse AG
estimated in a November 2009 report.  
 Health-care stocks plunged 5.8 percent yesterday after the
State Food and Drug Administration said on its Web site that
it’s investigating a deputy director at the agency for suspected
disciplinary violations.  
 Sales Catalyst  
 Orient Securities Co. analyst Li Shuhua said yesterday the
investigation was a “catalyst” for the selling of health-care
stocks, which were overvalued after a rally pushed reported
price earnings for the industry measure to 25 times compared
with 18 for the CSI 300 Index.  
 Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co. , which makes penicillin,
fell 5.5 percent to 19.12 yuan, extending yesterday’s 8.9
percent drop.  Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co.  lost 5.5 percent to
12.50 yuan after falling 6.8 percent yesterday. The CSI 300
Index slipped 0.4 percent today.
