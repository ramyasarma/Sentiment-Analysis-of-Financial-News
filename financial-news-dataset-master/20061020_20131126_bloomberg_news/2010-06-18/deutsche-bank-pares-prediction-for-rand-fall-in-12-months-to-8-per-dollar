             Deutsche Bank AG pared its estimates
for a decline in the South African rand over the next 12 months
because of “resilient” foreign inflows into the country’s
stock market and a “subdued” current account deficit, said the
bank in a weekly note to clients.  
 Deutsche Bank predicts the rand will trade at 8 per dollar
in 12 months time compared to its previous forecast of 8.5. The
South African currency advanced to 7.5435 per dollar as of 1:31
p.m. in Johannesburg.
