             Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. slumped 9 percent to 19.24 yuan as of 10:05 a.m.
in Shenzhen trading, headed for the biggest decline since July
2009.  
 The company shelved a plan to raise as much as HK$9.09
billion ($1.2 billion) in a share sale in Hong Kong, citing poor
market conditions, according to a June 14 statement. Trading
resumed today after being halted on June 16.
