             U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses as the expiration of equity futures and options and the
quarterly rebalancing of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index spurred
price swings.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,115.8 at 12:25 p.m. in New York after rallying as
much as 0.5 percent and slipping 0.2 percent.
