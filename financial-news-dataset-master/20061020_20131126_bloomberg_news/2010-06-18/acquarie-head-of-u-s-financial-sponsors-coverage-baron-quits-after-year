             Macquarie Group Ltd. , the Australian
bank whose head of U.S. equity capital markets quit this week,
lost the head of U.S. financial sponsors coverage,  David Baron ,
after one year at the firm, according to two people briefed on
the departure.  
 Baron was a managing director at the Sydney-based bank,
according to the people, who declined to be named because the
departure wasn’t made public. Equity capital markets head  Jim Rossman  resigned earlier this week after two years at the firm,
spokesman  Stephen Yan  confirmed June 16.  
 Macquarie has lost one managing director from the U.S.
investment-banking business in the last 18 months, Yan said
today. The firm has about 250 bankers in the unit and is
continuing to hire new employees, he said.  
 Macquarie has expanded its U.S.  investment-banking business 
in the past two years, purchasing boutique investment bank Fox-
Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller LLC in December for about
$146.7 million. Baron was hired in February 2009 after having
previously worked at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the New York
Times reported at the time.  
 Macquarie generated $1.35 billion of revenue from the
Americas for the year ended March 31, more than triple that of a
year earlier.
