             Key producers of natural rubber in
Southeast Asia should establish a regional rubber market to
minimize the impacts of “excessive speculation” on prices, a
Malaysian government official said.  
 “With excessive speculation, it’s timely for major
producing countries including Thailand, Indonesia and Malysia to
consider setting up an Asean regional rubber market to stabilize
rubber prices guided by supply and demand,” said Hamzah
Zainudin, deputy minister of Plantation Industries and
Commodities, in a speech at a conference in Kuala Lumpur today.
