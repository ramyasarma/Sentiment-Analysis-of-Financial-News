             Vivendi SA  investors asked a Paris
court to order former Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Marie Messier 
and six other former executives, as well as the company, to
repay them money lost during a $77 billion acquisition spree.  
 Vivendi isn’t a defendant and has participated in the trial
claiming it was also a victim of the acquisition campaign that
preceded Messier’s 2002 ouster. The company’s lawyer said today
that its goal was to “aid in a manifestation of the truth” of
the Messier era and said it should pay no damages.  
 Vivendi joined the case “so that we might at last turn the
page, so that we can focus on what Vivendi does now,” company
lawyer  Herve Pisani  said.  
 Shareholder lawyer Frederik-Karel Canoy asked the court to
“set a precedent,” estimating the loss at 160 euros ($198) per
share and seeking 10 euros a share in prejudice. He told the
court Vivendi should join in paying. An award would tell
shareholders “if we can stay in France or do we have to go to
the U.S.”  
 French investors joined a class action in New York, where
the jury in January cleared Messier and former Chief Financial
Officer  Guillaume Hannezo  of wrongdoing while finding the
company liable for misleading investors. Vivendi has appealed
and set aside 550 million euros for any potential award.  
 The Paris prosecutor advised against the trying the case,
saying there was insufficient evidence to support the charges.
An investigating judge overruled the decision.
