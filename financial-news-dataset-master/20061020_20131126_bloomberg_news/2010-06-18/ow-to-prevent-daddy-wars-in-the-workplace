             Will daddy wars erupt in this decade the way the mommy wars did in the last one? 

 Eight years ago, when  I wrote a book  examining why accomplished women have such a hard time integrating career and children, the data found that approximately 40 percent of professional women are childless at age 40. Despite the increase of family-friendly policies in many workplaces, the figures haven't changed.  

 But now, more and more  men  are finding themselves in the same position — and the numbers are trending upward. Recent survey data from the  Center for Work-Life Policy  show that at age 40, 31 percent of professional men are childless. 

 What's going on? The decision not to have children might make some sense for unemployed or underprivileged men who would have problems supporting a family. But what about well-paid guys with solid jobs that haven't been eliminated by the " mancession ?" Are they choosing not to have children? Or are they reacting to a creeping non-choice dictated by the demands of increased hours and responsibilities and amplified by recession-related anxiety? 

 The research raises concrete concerns for companies and organizations. When research tools guaranteeing anonymity pry off the veneer of politically correct proclamations of support for colleagues with children, what comes through is active resentment against both colleagues and employers: Childless men feel that colleagues with children get special treatment in the workplace: 43 percent of childless male professionals agree with the statement "colleagues with children are given more latitude with flexibility," and 37 percent of childless men agree with the statement "my personal commitments are perceived to be less important than those of colleagues with children." Male professionals without children are 60 percent more likely than male professionals with children to think their colleagues are judgmental about their personal lives.  Childless male professionals are less likely than those with children to be invited to social gatherings by co-workers. All of which adds up to bad news for employers. It's hard for a company to drive high rates of engagement if childless employees feel disgruntled, socially marginalized, and less valued than their colleagues with kids. How can employers prevent daddy wars in the workplace or, at least, damp down the simmering anger between the "haves" and "have nots"? 

 First of all, companies need to commit to work-life support for everyone. Despite the switch in HR semantics from " work-family " to " work-life ," the term is still blatant code for the toddler set. Like a demanding two-year-old, these parents often end up with the lion's share of the goodies: the biggest range of flexible work options, the most accommodating holiday schedules, and the extra time off. In an adult version of sandbox politics favoring fathers and mothers, the "others" are left to wail "It's not fair!" — with predictable results. 

 Second, employers must realize that there has to be a core of honor and respect in order for work-life benefits to apply to everyone. People want their life choices to be equally valued and celebrated, whether it's teaching English in China, studying the cello, training for a marathon, or raising kids. 

 A handful of smart companies already understand this.  Cisco Systems'  Extended Flex Program allows workers to take unpaid breaks of between 12 and 24 months. Although most participants are women who want to stop working temporarily after childbirth, other employees take time off to resolve eldercare issues, pursue a graduate degree, do volunteer work, or refocus their careers.  Citi's Alternative Workplace Strategy  reduces the cost of Citi's real estate while satisfying workers' desire for more flexibility. Employees who do much of their work online or over the phone can work remotely as much or as little as they — and their managers — wish.  Deloitte's Personal Pursuits  enables employees who have been with the firm for a minimum of two years to take up to five years off for any reason. Participants are assigned a mentor within the company to keep them connected with the firm and are guaranteed a job at the same level (although not necessarily the same role or team) when they return. Furthermore, participants can return on reduced-hour schedules and dial back up later. As a result, "we've been able to hold on to — and win back — talent," says  Barbara Adachi,  national managing principal,  Deloitte Women's Initiative . While lifting up options for non-parents, it's critical that companies not cut back on what they offer to parents. Work-life benefits are neither a competition nor a zero-sum game. Done right, they're a win for parents and childless workers — and make for a better, tension-free workplace.
