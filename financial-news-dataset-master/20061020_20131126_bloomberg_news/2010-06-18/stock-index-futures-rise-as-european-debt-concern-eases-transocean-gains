             U.S. stocks rose, with the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  advancing for a second week for the biggest
back-to-back weekly gain since November, amid speculation
Europe’s efforts to contain its debt crisis are succeeding.  
 Energy stocks rose with  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and Newmont
Mining Corp., the largest U.S. gold producer, leading commodity
producers higher.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  rose 1.9 percent amid
speculation Europe’s debt crisis has been contained.  Walgreen
Co.  and  CVS Caremark Corp.  climbed at least 1.8 percent after
ending an 11-day dispute over drug plans.  Cisco Systems Inc. 
increased 1.4 percent after signing an agreement with China’s
biggest Internet company.  
 The  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent to 1,117.51 as of 4 p.m. in
New York after falling as much as 0.2 percent.  The Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 0.2 percent, or 16.47 points, to
10,450.64.  
 “The concerns about a slowdown coming from Europe and China
aren’t manifesting themselves yet in the companies that have
been reporting in the last week or two,” said  James Thorne , who
oversees $2 billion as chief investment officer for equities at
MTB Investment Advisors in Baltimore.  
 Futures and options contracts on indexes and individual
stocks expired at the close of trading today. So-called
quadruple witching occurs once every three months. The quarterly
rebalancing of the S&P 500 and S&P gauges of smaller companies
also occurred after the close.  
 Commodities Gain  
 Energy producers  rose the most among 10 industry groups in
the S&P 500 as oil reversed earlier losses. Exxon Mobil, the
largest U.S. energy company, climbed 0.8 percent to $63.10.
Crude oil for July delivery gained 38 cents to $77.17 a barrel
in New York.  
 Newmont Mining increased 2.6 percent to $61.25. Gold
futures for August delivery rose 0.8 percent to a record
$1,258.30 on the Comex in New York.  
 DuPont , the third-largest U.S. chemical maker, gained 1.5
percent to $38.36.  
 Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan and HSBC Holdings Plc
raised $7.65 billion in the bond market as investors grow more
confident Europe’s debt crisis will be contained, averting
another credit freeze for lenders. JPMorgan gained the most in
the Dow, rising 1.9 percent to $39.8.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained 0.2 percent to 255.5 in
its eighth day of gains, the longest winning streak since July
2009.
