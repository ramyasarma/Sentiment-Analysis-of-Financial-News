             China, the largest cotton user, may
raise its  import  quota for the natural fiber as it sells more
from government stockpiles to quench a supply shortfall, an
industry analyst said.  
 The country may import an additional 1 million metric tons
and sell 600,000 tons from government stockpiles before the new
crop enters the market in August and September,  Dong Shuzhi ,
assistant manager at Jinshi Futures Co., said today.  
 “China’s cotton supply remains tight and domestic supply
seems insufficient to satisfy demand from rising consumption,”
Dong said.  
 China’s cotton consumption is estimated at 10.34 million
tons in 2009-2010 season, while production fell to 7.1 million
tons in the same period, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. Delayed planting this spring also poses a threat to
output in 2010-2011, he said.  
 Cotton-yarn prices have risen faster than cotton this year,
increasing demand for the raw material and boosting profits for
textile mills, Dong said.  
 China will need another 2.7 million tons of cotton in the
three months between July and September, consuming 900,000 tons
a month, he said.  
 Planting delays due to cold weather in Xinjiang, China’s
biggest producer, may slow the availability of the new crop,
Dong said. Nationwide harvesting may be delayed until October,
up to 20 days later than normal, Dong said.  
 The government “is working on relevant policies to satisfy
the textile industry’s demand and to ensure stability in the
market,”  the China Cotton Association  said today in a statement
on its website, without elaborating.
