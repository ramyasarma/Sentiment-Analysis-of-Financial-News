             Reliance Industries Ltd. should cede
its rights to a petroleum exploration block off India’s eastern
coast, the Mint newspaper reported, citing a recommendation to
the government by the Directorate of Hydrocarbons. The advise
was given after the company missed a deadline to declare the
block commercial viable, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information.  
 D.N. Narasimha Raju, a joint secretary at the oil ministry,
and a Reliance Industries spokesperson who wasn’t identified
declined to comment, according to the report.
