             Facebook Inc., the world’s most
popular social-networking service, had revenue of $700 million
to $800 million in 2009, topping earlier projections, according
to a person familiar with the matter.  
 The company had expected to post at least $500 million in
2009 sales, Facebook director  Marc Andreessen  said in July. The
person who cited last year’s results declined to be identified
because the numbers haven’t been public.  
 With more than 500 million users, Facebook has become a
magnet for advertisers such as  Starbucks Corp.  and Procter &
Gamble Co. The Internet company last year doubled sales staff to
cope with a rising tide of advertisers, which has more than
quadrupled since 2009 began.  
 Facebook, based in Palo Alto, California, has emerged as
the largest U.S. site for display ads. Its market share rose to
16 percent in the first quarter, from 11 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to ComScore Inc. The site had 519.1 million
users in April, up from 411 million in September, Reston,
Virginia-based ComScore said.  
 Facebook said in September that it was generating positive
cash flow, a milestone that often means a company has high
enough sales to cover operating expenses and capital spending
requirements. The company said it reached that point earlier
than expected.  
 Jonathan Thaw , a spokesman for the company, declined to
comment. Facebook’s 2009 revenue figure was reported earlier by
Reuters.
