             U.S. stocks extended gains, led by
banks and commodity producers, amid speculation Europe’s efforts
to contain its debt crisis are succeeding.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,119.37 at 10:36 a.m. in New York, extending a second straight
weekly advance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.15
points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,473.32. Both are trading above
their highest closing levels in a month.  
 Benchmark indexes fluctuated earlier as the expiration of
futures and options and the quarterly rebalancing of the S&P 500
triggered price swings.
