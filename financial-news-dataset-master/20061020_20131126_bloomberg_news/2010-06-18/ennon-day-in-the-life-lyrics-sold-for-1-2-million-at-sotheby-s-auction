             John Lennon ’s handwritten lyrics for
the Beatles masterpiece “A Day in the Life” sold for $1.2
million at Sotheby’s in New York today.  
 An unidentified American bidding by phone bought the
lyrics, which were estimated to fetch $500,000 to $800,000.
Three buyers competed for the document.  
 Written on both sides of a single sheet of paper and signed
by Lennon, the prize once belonged to Beatles road manager Mal
Evans.  Sotheby’s London  sold the lyrics in 1992, and  Bonhams  in
New York offered them in a sealed-bid auction in 2006, where
they didn’t sell.  
 The sheet features crossed out words, corrections and
additions in different colors.  
 The $1.2 million, which included a buyer’s commission, fell
just short of the record for a Beatles handwritten lyric. “All
You Need Is Love” sold for $1.25 million in 2005 at U.K.-based
Cooper Owen auction house.  
 Considered one of the Beatles’ most influential songs, “A
Day in the Life” is the closing track on the band’s 1967 album,
“Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” The song has segments
written independently by Lennon and  Paul McCartney . Connecting
the two parts is a score performed by a 40-piece orchestra. The
song topped the U.S. and U.K. charts, and won four Grammy awards
in 1968.  
 Lennon, born in Liverpool in 1940, was shot dead outside
his New York apartment house in 1980. In 2003, his handwritten
lyrics to the Beatles song “Nowhere Man” sold for $455,500,
including commission, at Christie’s International.
