             Spain’s debt auction yesterday was
“hardly news to cheer” because local banks were likely buying
to satisfy regulatory requirements, according to Greg Gibbs, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 “We are not impressed with the better-than-expected
auction result” given “these are the same banks that are
accessing increasing volumes of liquidity” from the European
Central Bank,  Gibbs , who is based in Sydney, said in a note to
clients today. “The increased liquidity provision by the ECB is
essentially helping support the Spanish bond market.”  
 It’s more likely that the extra  yield  Spain must pay
investors when compared with German bunds will resume widening,
as RBS estimates Spain must raise a further 58 billion euros
this year, with about 15 billion euros of that in June and July,
the note said.  
 Spanish banks “may feel captive to supporting the domestic
market,” and there’s likely to be “continuing pressure on the
ECB to step up its liquidity and asset purchases,” Gibbs wrote.
