             U.K. stocks closed little changed,
ending the longest stretch of gains for the benchmark  FTSE 100
Index  since July 2009, as declines in companies from BT Group
Plc to GlaxoSmithKline Plc offset a rally by gold producers.  
 BT Group, Britain’s largest fixed-lined phone company, and
Glaxo, the biggest drugmaker, fell at least 1.5 percent.
Fresnillo Plc and Randgold Resources Ltd. climbed more than 2
percent as gold advanced to a record in New York.  
 The  FTSE 100  slipped 3.05, or less than 0.1 percent, to
5,250.84, after swinging between gains and losses at least eight
times today. The gauge is down 9.9 percent from this year’s high
on April 15 amid concern about Europe’s debt crisis. The FTSE
All-Share Index was little changed while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
rallied 0.5 percent, led by Allied Irish Banks Plc.  
 “It has been a fairly volatile session,” said Anthony
Grech, London-based head of research at IG Index. “With little
in the way of economic announcements for the market to focus on
there has been something of a lack of direction today.”  
 BT Group  paced declining shares, falling 2 percent to 136.8
pence as Standard & Poor’s lowered its recommendation for the
phone company to “sell” from “hold.”  
 Separately, Communication Workers Union Deputy General
Secretary Andy Kerr said he is confident that CWU members who
work for BT will vote in favor of a strike over pay, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  
 Glaxo Falls  
 Glaxo shares lost 1.6 percent to 1,196 pence as European
drugmakers retreated. Roche Holding AG said patients showed
hypersensitivity to an experimental diabetes treatment, while
Sanofi-Aventis SA fell on renewed concern that one of its drugs
may be linked to an increased risk of cancer.  
 Fresnillo, a gold and silver producer, climbed 3.4 percent
to 1,060 pence as gold futures rose to a record $1,262 an ounce
on demand for a haven amid Europe’s fiscal woes and dimming
prospects for the U.S. economy. The metal has climbed 15 percent
this year, outperforming equities and bonds.  
 Randgold Resources, an owner of mines in West Africa,
rallied 2.9 percent to 6,430 pence. Xstrata, a diversified
mining company, climbed 1.6 percent to 1,027 pence.  
 Allied Irish surged 10 percent to 1.11 euros in Dublin
trading amid speculation the lender will reach agreement on the
sale of its stake in M&T Bank Corp.  
 “The commencement of the disposal process should give
investors some confidence on progress ahead of the year-end
capital raising deadline,” analyst  Eamonn Hughes  at Goodbody
Stockbrokers in Dublin said in a research note today.  
 Aviva Advances  
 Aviva Plc  rose 1.5 percent to 353.4 pence, the highest
close since April 29. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its
recommendation for the shares to “overweight” from
“neutral,” citing the insurer’s dividend yield and cash flow.  
 Electrocomponents Plc , a supplier of 350,000 products
ranging from cables to calculators, rallied 3.2 percent to 226
pence after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the shares to its
“conviction buy” list.  
 BP Plc retreated, slipping 0.6 percent to 357.45 pence. The
shares reversed an earlier rally of as much as 5.5 percent after
the company’s credit rating was cut three levels by Moody’s
Investors Service on concern that costs from cleaning up the
Gulf of Mexico oil spill and meeting legal liabilities may be
higher than previously expected.
