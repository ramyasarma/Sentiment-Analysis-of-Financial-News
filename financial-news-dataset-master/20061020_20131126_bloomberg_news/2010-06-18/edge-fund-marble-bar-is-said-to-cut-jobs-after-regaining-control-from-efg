             Marble Bar Asset Management LLP , a
London-based hedge-fund firm, fired portfolio managers and
traders this week after executives regained control from EFG
International AG, people with knowledge of the cuts said.  
 The firm trimmed staff to 33 from as many as 65 when owned
by EFG, the Swiss bank controlled by Greek billionaire  Spiro Latsis  and his family, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the firings weren’t publicly disclosed.
Marble Bar management including founder  Hilton Nathanson  last
month bought back the firm from Zurich-based EFG in exchange for
a portion of its future fees.  
 The firm’s assets declined to about $1 billion from a peak
of $6 billion in the first half of 2008 and from $4.4 billion
when EFG bought the stake in December 2007, according to EFG
statements. Marble Bar’s main hedge fund will focus on European
stocks, dropping strategies that had been added since EFG’s
purchase, the people said. Nathanson, a 40-year-old Australian,
started the firm to trade European equities in 2002.  
 Keith Gapp , a spokesman for EFG, and Andrew Hood, a
spokesman for Marble Bar, didn’t return phone calls seeking
comment. Marble Bar posted a pretax profit of $9.1 million in
2009, according to EFG’s annual report.
