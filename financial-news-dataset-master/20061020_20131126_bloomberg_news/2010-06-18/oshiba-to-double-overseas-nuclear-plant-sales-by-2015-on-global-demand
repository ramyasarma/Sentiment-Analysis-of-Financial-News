             Toshiba Corp. , Japan’s second-
biggest supplier of reactors, plans to double overseas nuclear
sales by 2015 and invest 50 billion yen ($550 million) a year in
its power business to tap growing demand.  
 More than seventy percent of nuclear sales should come from
abroad by 2015, compared with 60 percent in the year ended March
2010,  Yasuharu Igarashi , senior vice president and head of the
power systems division, said in an interview in Tokyo yesterday.
Toshiba’s nuclear power unit  targets  700 billion yen of overseas
sales by 2015 compared with about 360 billion yen in fiscal 2009,
said  Ken Shinjo , a company spokesman.  
 Toshiba has developed a cheaper 4S model mini-reactor and
is expanding its nuclear fuel business in a bid to win new
customers as it vies for a larger share of the growing atomic
energy market. A total of 142 new reactors are  planned  worldwide
by 2030, led by China and India, which account for 42 percent of
new plants, according to  the World Nuclear Association .  
 Toshiba will target countries such as the U.S. and U.K.,
whose governments plan rapid expansions of existing nuclear
programs to increase low-carbon power generation, Igarashi said.
“After that, there are developing countries that have oil money
and want to change their energy mix,” he said.  
 Most of the 50 billion a year earmarked for power
investment will go on developing the nuclear division, including
atomic fuel, Igarashi said. Toshiba is following the lead of
Areva SA, the world’s biggest nuclear reactor maker, in
marketing fuel together with reactors.  
 “The balance between demand and supply in uranium and the
enrichment business may shift by 2015 as many countries are
planning to build nuclear plants,” Igarashi said.
