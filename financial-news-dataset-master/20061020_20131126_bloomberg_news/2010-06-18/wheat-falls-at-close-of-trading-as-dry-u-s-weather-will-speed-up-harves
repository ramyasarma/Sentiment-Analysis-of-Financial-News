             Wheat fell for the first time in
seven sessions, dropping in the closing minutes of trading, on
speculation that dry, warm weather will allow farmers to speed
up the collection of the U.S. winter-wheat crop.  
 Little rain is expected this weekend in southern Kansas and
parts of Oklahoma and Texas, the three biggest growers of winter
wheat, according to a report by Accuweather.com. Northern Kansas
and Nebraska may get some moisture. Before today, the price
gained 12 percent since June 9 on concern that wet weather would
delay the harvest and damage the crop.  
 “It’s a harvest Friday in Kansas,” said  Mike Zuzolo , the
president of Global Commodity Analytics in Lafayette, Indiana.
“The longs may be liquidating, so we could see some profit-
taking, especially without news. Wheat needs to be watched the
closest.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 0.75 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $4.7775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after rising as much as 1.6 percent. The price was up until the
final minutes of trading, and ended up gaining 4.5 percent for
the week.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
