             A commission in Turkey’s parliament
approved fiscal rule legislation that forces governments to
target a budget deficit of 1 percent of economic output.  
 The legislation will be discussed in the main chamber of
the Ankara assembly in the coming days. The law will go into
effect from the start of 2011, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan
said today.
