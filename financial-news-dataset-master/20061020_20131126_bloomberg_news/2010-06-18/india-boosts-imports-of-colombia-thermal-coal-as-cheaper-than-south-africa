             Colombia boosted sales of power-
plant coal to India as Agarwal Coal Corp. imported a second
consignment late last month, according to a trader and ship-
tracking data.  
 Awobasan, a 150,275 tons bulk carrier, unloaded a 40,010
metric tons shipment of Colombian coal at Gangavaram, a port in
south-eastern India, on May 26, according to AISLive on
Bloomberg and mjunction Services Ltd., a trader. Colombian coal
cost about $92 a ton on a delivered basis compared with $110 for
supplies from South Africa, mjunction said.  
 South Africa and Colombia, which last year were the biggest
exporters of steam coal to countries with ports on the Atlantic
Ocean, are boosting supplies to India, where they get better
prices. Both shipped 63 million tons of coal to Atlantic
countries last year, according to a January report from Euracoal,
a lobby group.  
 Adani Enterprises Ltd. , India’s biggest coal importer,
agreed to buy thermal coal from Colombia for the first time as
surging  electricity  demand prompted diversification of purchases,
an official said in March.  
 Colombian coal supplies may rise by 8 million tons in 2010
to 71 million after falling by about 6 million tons last year,
according to a report in March by Macquarie Group Ltd.  
 Indian thermal coal imports surged last year to a little
less than 60 million tons from about 30 million in 2008,
Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report in March. India plans to
almost double electricity generation capacity by 2012, when the
shortage of coal will exceed 200 million tons, according to the
report.
