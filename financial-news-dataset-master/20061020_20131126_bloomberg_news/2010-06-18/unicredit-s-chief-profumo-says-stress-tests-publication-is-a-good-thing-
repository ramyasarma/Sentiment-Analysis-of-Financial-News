             UniCredit SpA  Chief Executive
Officer  Alessandro Profumo  welcomed the Bank of Italy’s decision
to publish the results of stress tests on the nation’s lenders.  
 “For countries with strong banks like Italy, it’s
absolutely a good thing,” Profumo told reporters at the
sidelines of a conference in Rome. “I think it’s a good thing
for all, and certainly it’s something important for Italy.”  
 The Italian central bank’s announcement today came after an
agreement by European Union leaders to publish the results of
stress tests on major banks by the end of July to boost
confidence in financial institutions. EU leaders also agreed
yesterday to pursue a banking levy and a financial transaction
tax that would apply worldwide to ensure fair burden-sharing and
rein in systemic risks.  
 Profumo said plans for a bank tax are “deeply wrong,”
favoring the introduction of a fund to support troubled lenders.  
 “I think it would be opportune to contribute to a fund,
which may be able to intervene in a situation of difficulty,”
he said.  
 Banking shares have been among the biggest decliners in
Europe this year amid the region’s sovereign debt crisis.
UniCredit has dropped 17 percent in the period, compared with an
8.6 percent retreat in the 52-member  Bloomberg Europe Banks and
Financial Services Index .
