             Soybeans rose, notching the first
weekly gain since April, on speculation that unusually heavy
rain will leave U.S. Midwest fields too muddy to plant. Corn
also gained.  
 Farmers in parts of Iowa and Illinois, the biggest U.S.
soybean producers, must decide by June 20 to receive crop
insurance payments instead of planting. Some areas received six
times the normal rainfall in the past month, delaying soybean
seeding and threatening to damage newly planted corn crops.  
 “The rain amounts are looking extremely heavy for corn and
for beans,” said  Mike Zuzolo , the president of Global Commodity
Analytics in Lafayette, Indiana. “The preventive planting date
is coming up for beans on June 20. That keeps shorts from
pressing the downside and keep longs from taking profits.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 5.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $9.305 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price gained 2.3 percent this week, the first since April
23.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, at $3.805 a bushel on the CBOT. Helped by a 2.6 percent
increase this week, the price has jumped 13 percent since June
7, the last time futures declined.
