             Acer Inc., the world’s largest
supplier of notebook computers, forecasts better-than-expected
third quarter revenue, Chairman J.T. Wang said today in Taipei
at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting.  
 Sales for the third quarter may grow about 10 percent and
15 percent from the second quarter, Wang said. This is higher
than an earlier estimate of a rise of 10 percent.
