             Canada’s spring-wheat crop may be of
reduced quality if harvesting is delayed by rain and cool
weather, forecaster Martell Crop Projections said.  
 The weather conditions may hurt baking properties for the
grain, Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin-based Martell said in an online
 report  dated yesterday.  
 The country, the world’s second-largest wheat exporter
after the U.S., also faces a shrinking planted area. Excess rain
means as much as 12.5 million acres of  farmland  won’t be sown
this year, the Canadian Wheat Board said June 11.  
 “Wheat quality may be in jeopardy,” Martell said. “Hard
red spring wheat is valued for its high protein that makes it an
excellent bread wheat. History shows lower-protein wheat comes
from wet growing seasons.”  
 Late ripening of wheat would push the harvest into October
and November, increasing exposure to damp conditions, frost and
snow, according to Martell.  
 “In the past, when harvesting occurred very late, immature
green kernels and mold were present at the harvest, causing
sharp downgrades to crop quality,” Martell said. “In the
extreme case, a big fraction of hard red spring wheat is
degraded to feed quality and cannot be used for bread.”  
 Canada’s western prairies require warm weather to boost
crop development and dry out soggy fields, the forecaster said.
