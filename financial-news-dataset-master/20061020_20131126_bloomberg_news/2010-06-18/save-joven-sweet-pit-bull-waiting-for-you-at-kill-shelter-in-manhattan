             Joven, a neutered 2-year-old male
pit bull mix, was rescued from a building on Eighth Avenue.  
 The 48-pound sweetie came to  New York’s Animal Care &
Control , the city’s largest rescue and adoption agency. He gets
food, shelter and TLC, yet Joven’s days there are numbered.  
 Have a drink tonight and extend a helping hand to Joven and
his friends at the AC&C. Every year, the shelter does its best
to protect and find homes for about 40,000 dogs and cats that
come through its doors.  
 But that’s a lot of critters and the agency is condemned to
euthanize many.  
 The fundraiser tonight features Andy Troy, radio show host
on the  Centanni Broadcasting Network , and  Maria Milito  of New
York radio’s Q104.3.  
 The event will be held at  BLVD , a nightclub on the Lower
East Side with 18,000 square feet and seven rooms spread over
two floors.  
 There’ll be cheap booze, free entertainment and admission,
and lots of people you want to meet with a $5 drink in your
hand. Raffle prizes include a three-day all-inclusive stay at
Cove Haven Entertainment Resorts in the Pocono Mountains of
Pennsylvania; an original lithograph of an 1898  Harper’s
magazine  cover by Edward Penfield; and a $300 gift certificate
to Saks Fifth Avenue.  
 Dog Dates  
 Adoptable animals like Joven will greet you at the door.
Consider Layla, a 3-year-old female long-hair Chihuahua mix.
Some bad person left her tied to a fence near Bruckner
Boulevard.  
 Then there’s sweet-tempered Bella, a 2-year-old female
beagle mix, who was roaming the streets. She would be perfect
for a more-active family that can give her the exercise this
breed needs.  
 Archie, a jet-black Chihuahua mix would also like a human
companion. He’s about 18 months old.  
 You can bring your own dog. Raffle tickets will be sold by
the ladies of Tall Outstanding Women, a charity-awareness
organization that boasts a 6-foot minimum height requirement for
membership. Conclusion: Even if your date is a real dog, this is
a big night out.  
 Help Me Please  
 Ultimately, of all the breeds, pit bulls and pit bull
mixes, like Joven, often need the most help. Of the 38 adoptable
dogs listed on the New York City AC&C’s website, 30 are “pit
bull terriers” or “pit bull mixes,” often perceived as
dangerous despite the fact that there is no clear evidence to
support that opinion.  
 Many insurance companies will not insure a house or
apartment if there’s a pit bull in residence, in part due to the
association with dog fighting and violence.  
 Football player  Michael Vick , of course, is a notorious
example of pit bull abuser. He bet on dog fights and yet
returned to the game after a brief stay behind bars.  
 “They have a P.R. problem. The 24/7 news cycle is partly
to blame,” said Stacy Coleman, executive director of Animal
Farm Foundation Inc. in Bangall, New York, which is devoted to
pit bulls and their problem.  
 “When you go to a shelter, consider all dogs and get to
know them as individuals,” Coleman said.  
 Don’t write off a pit because it doesn’t look like a
poodle.  
 The AC&C fundraiser is from 6 to 11 p.m. tonight at 199
Bowery. For more information on the event: +1-917-754-4329. Go

 Animal Farm Foundation,
 http://www.animalfarmfoundation.org , offers educational and
financial support, on-site internships and classes, and has a
small shelter.
