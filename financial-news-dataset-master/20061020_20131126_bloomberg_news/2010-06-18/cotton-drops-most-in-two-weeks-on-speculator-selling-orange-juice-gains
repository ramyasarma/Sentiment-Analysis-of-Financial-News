             Cotton prices fell the most in two
weeks on signs that speculators reduced their holdings. Orange-
juice futures advanced.  
 Cotton closed below its 100-day moving average yesterday.
In the week ended June 8, hedge-fund managers and other large
speculators lowered their net-long positions, or bets prices
will rise, to the lowest level in nine months.  
 “We have lost momentum and broken some short-term
technical support and may see some follow-through in specs
getting out of positions,” said  Peter Egli , the director of
risk management in Chicago for U.K.-based Plexus Cotton Ltd.  
 Cotton for December delivery fell 0.47 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 78.95 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since June 4.
Earlier, the commodity fell to 78.29 cents, the lowest level
since June 10. The fiber, little changed for the week, has
climbed 4.4 percent this year.  
 U.S. production will be 16.7 million bales in the year that
begins Aug. 1, up from an estimated 12.2 million in the current
season, according to the Department of Agriculture. Next
season’s output may be “raised considerably” amid favorable
conditions, especially for plants in Texas, Egli said yesterday
in a report. The state is the biggest U.S. grower. (A bale
weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.)  
 “We don’t remember having seen a better Texas crop ever,”
Egli said. “Plenty of subsoil moisture, a great start, low
abandonment and intermittent rainfall are all combining to what
promises to be a record yield.”  
 The December contract is “likely to retreat” because of
the size of the crop in the U.S., the world’s largest cotton
supplier, he said.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery gained 0.15
cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.4425 a pound in New York. The
commodity gained 0.6 percent for the week and 78 percent in the
past 12 months.
