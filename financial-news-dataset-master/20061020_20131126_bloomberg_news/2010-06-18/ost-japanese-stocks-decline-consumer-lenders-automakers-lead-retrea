             Japanese  stocks  fell with consumer
lenders sliding and dragging down banks as a stricter lending
rule clouded earnings prospects. Softbank Corp. and Daikin
Industries Ltd. climbed on analysts’ ratings.  
 Acom Co. , the nation’s largest consumer lender by market
value, slumped 5.6 percent, while Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., which owns 37 percent of the company, lost 1.4 percent.
Softbank, Japan’s sole provider of Apple Inc.’s iPhone, jumped
2.7 percent after Nomura Holdings Inc. raised its price estimate.
Daikin, an air-conditioner maker, advanced 2.1 percent after
Credit Suisse lifted its rating to “outperform.”  
 The  Topix index  dipped 0.3 percent to 884.64 at the close
in Tokyo. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  lost 0.04 percent to
9,995.02, trimming its weekly gain to 3 percent.  
 “The business environment for consumer lenders is very
challenging,” said  Seiichiro Iwamoto , who helps oversee about
$35 billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “With good
earnings this year already priced in, the outlook for the
second-half is increasingly hazy.”  
 The Topix has climbed 2.1 percent this week, the steepest
weekly advance since the period ended April 2, as improved
sentiment among American consumers and growth in New York
manufacturing boosted expectations that demand for Japanese-made
goods in the U.S. will increase. The  value  of stocks traded in
Tokyo has been less than its 12-month average this week.  
 Foreign Investors  
 The advances have lifted the average price of shares in the
gauge to 17 times  estimated earnings , compared with an 18-month
low of 16.4 times on June 9, according to analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. A report from the Tokyo Stock Exchange
showed yesterday that sales of Japanese equities by overseas
investors last week swelled to the highest level in more than
two years.  
 “Investors have become more cautious after yesterday’s
report on share sales by foreign investors,” said  Toshiki Morimoto , head of program trading at Tokyo-based Okasan
Securities Co.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dipped 0.2
percent. The gauge was down most of the day in New York
yesterday before a strengthening euro boosted the index to a 0.1
percent gain at the close.  
 Consumer lenders  collectively  posted the steepest plunge
among the Topix’s 33 industry groups as the stricter rules took
effect today. The new law caps interest rates at 20 percent and
prohibits lending to borrowers with consumer debt equal to a
third or more of their annual income.  
 IPhone 4  
 Acom dropped 5.6 percent to 1,129 yen, while  Mitsubishi UFJ ,
the nation’s biggest listed bank, slid 1.4 percent to 420 yen.
Promise Co., Japan’s second-biggest consumer lender by market
value and an affiliate of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. ,
sank 6.1 percent to 648 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan’s No. 2 bank
by market value, fell 1.7 percent to 2,650 yen.  
 Mizuho Securities Co. cut its price estimate on Acom by 16
percent to 800 yen and on Promise by 7.7 percent to 600 yen and
reiterated its “ underperform ” ratings on the stocks.  
 Softbank and Daikin gained, helping narrow the Nikkei 225’s
decline. Softbank, Japan’s No. 3 mobile-phone carrier, jumped
2.7 percent to 2,488 yen, the highest close since December 2007.
 Daisaku Masuno , an analyst at Nomura, raised his price estimate
by 4.4 percent to 3,380 yen, saying Apple’s iPhone 4 will help
increase customers.  
 Softbank said it will halt pre-orders of the iPhone 4 at
the end of business today, citing “excess demand.”  
 Daikin , the nation’s first maker of air conditioners for
trains, rose 2.1 percent to 2,960 yen. Credit Suisse lifted its
ratings from “neutral,” saying demand for air conditioners
will increase in China.  
 “Emerging economies, particularly in Asia, remain
robust,” said  Naoteru Teraoka , general manager at the
investment unit of Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about $22 billion.
