             Tyson Foods Inc.,   Smithfield Foods
Inc.  and other large meatpackers would be barred from buying
animals from each other and limits would be set on their
exclusive contracts with livestock suppliers, under a rule
proposed by the government to address antitrust concerns.  
 Agriculture Secretary  Tom Vilsack  said the proposal
“represents an aggressive rule-making effort.” Producers
“should not be treated less favorably because they’re small,”
he said today in a conference call with reporters.  
 The rule addresses longstanding concerns about competition
in the livestock industry that have been discussed at a series
of hearings by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the
Justice Department, the USDA said in e-mailed  statement .
Hearings have been held in Iowa, Alabama and Wisconsin and are
scheduled in Colorado and Washington D.C. later this year.  
 Farmers and their lobbyists have called for regulators to
examine whether large packers such as Springdale, Arkansas-based
 Tyson Foods , the biggest U.S. meat producer, control the prices
they pay for cattle, hogs and poultry.  
 Under the proposed rule, meatpackers would be required to
communicate prices to competitors. Sample contracts would also
be made available on a USDA website, in a move to improve
transparency, the department said.  
 The proposed rule will be published on June 22 and will be
open for comment until Aug. 23, the USDA said. After that, the
department will consider a final rule.
