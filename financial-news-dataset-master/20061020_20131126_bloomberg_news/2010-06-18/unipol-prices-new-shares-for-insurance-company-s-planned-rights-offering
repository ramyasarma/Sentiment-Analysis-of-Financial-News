             Unipol Gruppo finanziario SpA,,
Italy’s third-largest insurer, will sell new shares at 36
percent less than yesterday’s closing price in a planned rights
offer to boost capital.  
 Unipol will sell ordinary shares at 44.5 cents each and
offer three shares for every seven held, the Bologna-based bank
said in a statement late yesterday. The company will also offer
new preference shares at 30 cents apiece in a sale to raise as
much as 500 million euros ($620 million).  
 The insurer has been hurt as the economic slowdown and
credit shortage have reduced demand for policies and cut
margins. Unipol is also facing tougher competition in its home
market, while rising claims related to natural disasters curbs
profit.  
 Unipol investors can exercise rights to buy stock from June
21 to July 9, while its main shareholder, Finsoe SpA, with a
50.7 percent stake, will purchase new shares to maintain its
holding.  
 Unipol rose 0.2 percent to 69 cents in Milan trading
yesterday, giving the company a market value of 1.4 billion
euros.
