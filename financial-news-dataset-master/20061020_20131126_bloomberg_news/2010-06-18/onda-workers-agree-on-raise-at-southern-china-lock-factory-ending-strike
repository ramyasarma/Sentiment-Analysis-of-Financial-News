             Honda Motor Co. raised employee
wages at a lock factory in southern China today, ending the
third strike by a supplier to the Japanese carmaker within a
month.  
 Workers, who started their walkout June 9, and then
suspended it June 15 while talks were held with management,
agreed to Honda Lock (Guangdong) Co.’s offer, Takayuki Fujii, a
Beijing-based spokesman for Honda, said in a phone interview.
