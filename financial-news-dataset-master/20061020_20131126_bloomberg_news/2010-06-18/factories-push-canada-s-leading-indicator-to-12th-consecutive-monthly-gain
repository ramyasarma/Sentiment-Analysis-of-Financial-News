             Canada’s index of  leading economic
indicators  advanced for a 12th straight month in May, led by
gains in new orders for manufacturers.  
 The index rose 0.9 percent, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said the index
would gain 0.7 percent, based on the median of 13 estimates.
Overall, six of the index’s 10 components increased.  
 Canada’s economy, which started contracting in the fourth
quarter of 2008, emerged from its slump last year at a faster
pace than the Bank of Canada anticipated, prompting it to become
the first G-7 central bank to raise  borrowing costs  earlier this
month.  
 Statistics Canada reported June 4 that  employment  rose for
a fifth straight month in May, a gain of 24,700 jobs that was
greater than economists predicted, after a record 108,700 jump
in April. Gross domestic product grew 6.1 percent at an
annualized pace in the first quarter, Statistics Canada said May
31, the fastest pace in a decade.  
 New orders for manufacturers led gains, rising 4 percent
from the previous month. The ratio of factory shipments to
inventories strengthened for a 10th consecutive month, while the
average workweek grew by 0.3 percent, rising for the first time
since September. The housing index, a composite of housing
starts and existing home sales, fell 1.2 percent.  
 Sales at furniture and appliance stores rose 1.4 percent on
the month, Statistics Canada said, while sales of other durable
goods such as cars sales fell 0.4 percent.  
 In a separate report, Statistics Canada said the number of
Canadians receiving jobless benefits dropped 0.1 percent in
April to 667,380.
