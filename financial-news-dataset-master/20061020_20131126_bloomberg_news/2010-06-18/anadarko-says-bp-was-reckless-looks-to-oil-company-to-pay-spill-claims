             Anadarko Petroleum Corp. said the
Deepwater Horizon accident that led to the oil spill in the Gulf
of Mexico was preventable and the direct result of BP Plc’s
“reckless decisions and actions.” Anadarko also said it looks to
BP to pay all legitimate claims.  
 “BP’s behavior and actions likely represent gross
negligence or willful misconduct and thus affect the obligations
of the parties under the operating agreement,” Anadarko Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett said. “We recognize that
ultimately we have obligations under federal law related to the
oil spill, but will look to BP to continue to pay all legitimate
claims as they have repeatedly stated that they will do.”
