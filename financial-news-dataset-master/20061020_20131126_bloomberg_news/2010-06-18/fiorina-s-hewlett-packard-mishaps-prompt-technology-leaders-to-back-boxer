             Carly Fiorina , the former head of
Hewlett-Packard Co., faces a wall of opposition from her Silicon
Valley peers as she campaigns to win one of California’s U.S.
Senate seats.  
 Her victory in the Republican primary last week puts
Fiorina up against Democrat incumbent  Barbara Boxer , a senator
since 1993. Boxer has the financial support of local executives,
including Cisco Systems Inc.’s  John Chambers , Oracle Corp.’s
 Larry Ellison , Netflix Inc.’s  Reed Hastings , and  John Doerr  from
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.  
 Fiorina’s inability to win the backing of technology
leaders contrasts with EBay Inc.’s former chief,  Meg Whitman ,
who’s racking up funding from Silicon Valley in the state’s
gubernatorial race. Fiorina’s lack of support, even from
executives such as Chambers who are known to back Republicans,
may reflect misgivings about her tenure at  Hewlett-Packard ,
which lost half its  market value  on her watch. It also stiffens
the challenge of beating a Democrat in a Democratic state.  
 “It makes it a harder hill to climb for Carly,” said  Jim Cunneen , who served as a Republican state assemblyman in Silicon
Valley from 1994 to 2000. He’s currently a principal at
political consulting firm California Strategies in San Jose.
“She has a lot of work to do to reach out to independents and
moderates, but also to reach out to this tech community that
certainly knows her private-sector experience the best of
anybody in the state.”  
 Boxer’s Lead  
 Fiorina, 55, aims to beat a senator who’s spent almost
three decades in the house and senate working on legislation to
support Silicon Valley. As of May 19, Boxer, 69, had raised
$16.3 million in donations for the November election, more than
double Fiorina’s $7.4 million, according to the  Center for
Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan group in Washington.  
 Boxer has received $229,487 from computer and Internet
companies, compared with $45,550 for Fiorina, the group found.  
 Among voters, Boxer leads Fiorina 48 percent to 43 percent,
a Rasmussen Reports  poll  found. The June 9 telephone survey of
500 likely voters had an error margin of plus or minus 4.5
percent. With statewide  unemployment  at almost 13 percent and
California having the fourth-highest home-foreclosure rate in
the country, the incumbent could face a challenge, Cunneen said.  
 “This election is really about jobs and the economy, and
there aren’t many jobs and the economy is still sputtering,”
said Cunneen, who previously worked for Fiorina’s primary
opponent, former Congressman  Tom Campbell . “Despite early
returns and contributions, this will still be a very competitive
race.”  
 Worker Visas  
 Boxer’s popularity in Silicon Valley is due in part to her
role as chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, where she has focused on creating clean-energy jobs
and reducing carbon emissions. She’s also backed policy for the
granting of more  H-1B visas , which bring technology engineers to
the U.S. from overseas. And in 2004 she opposed rules that
forced companies to expense stock options for employees, saying
it would eliminate an incentive for attracting top talent.  
 “Barbara has worked with our industry on critical issues
impacting Silicon Valley, including education, promoting
innovation, stock options and tax policies,” Chambers,  Cisco ’s
chief executive officer and a founding member of Technology
Leaders for Boxer, said in an e-mail.  
 Chambers, 60, often backs Republicans, including
presidential candidate  John McCain  in 2008. In that election,
Democrat  Barack Obama  won 61 percent of votes in California to
McCain’s 37 percent. Fiorina served with Chambers on Cisco’s
board from 2001 to 2003. She also was an economic adviser to
McCain’s campaign.  
 Executives’ Support  
 Boxer’s backers for the 2010 election also include EBay CEO
 John Donahoe , Autodesk Inc. CEO  Carl Bass , Symantec Corp.
Chairman  John Thompson  and Yahoo! Inc. co-founder  Jerry Yang .  
 “It isn’t surprising that a three-term incumbent senator
is supported financially by many in the tech industry,” said
Amy Thoma, a spokeswoman for Fiorina. “Carly enjoys a broad
range of support both from the Silicon Valley and throughout the
state and now that the primary has ended we expect that support
to continue to grow.”  
 Fiorina’s most high-profile support so far in Silicon
Valley comes from Intel Corp. CEO  Paul Otellini  and Kleiner
Perkins co-founder  Tom Perkins .  
 Fiorina joined Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard
as CEO in 1999 after spending 20 years at AT&T Corp. and its
spinoff Lucent Technologies Inc. Two years later, she
orchestrated the $18.9 billion  acquisition  of Compaq Computer
Corp. to grab a bigger piece of the personal-computer market.
The strategy backfired and HP lost its lead in the industry to
Dell Inc., leading to Fiorina’s ouster in 2005.  
 ‘Lot of Animus’  
 “There’s a lot of animus about her business decisions at
HP,” said  Barbara O’Connor , director of the Institute for the
Study of Politics and Media at California State University,
Sacramento. “It’s mostly the Compaq decision and how she handled
it.”  
 In the governor’s race, Whitman, 53, is having little
trouble finding support in Silicon Valley. She’s challenging the
state’s Democratic attorney general,  Jerry Brown , for the chance
to succeed Republican Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger , who is
departing because of term limits.  
 The $54 million Whitman has raised this year, through May
22, trumps the $16.7 million brought in by Brown, according to
data from the California Secretary of State. Her donors include
Chambers, Donahoe, Yang, Otellini, Apple Inc.’s former finance
chief  Fred Anderson , Intuit Inc. CEO  Brad Smith  and Microsoft
Corp. CEO  Steve Ballmer .  
 Record at EBay  
 In Whitman’s decade as CEO of EBay, she took the e-commerce
company public and built its  market value  to about $40 billion,
with about $7.5 billion in annual  revenue .  
 Her record wasn’t without blemish. In her final years at
the helm, she failed to reignite slowing sales. And a bidding
war between Google Inc. and Yahoo forced Whitman to pay $2.6
billion for Skype in 2005.  EBay  wrote down the division’s value
by $900 million in 2007 before selling it last year.  
 Whitman is less conservative politically than Fiorina on
one key issue: abortion. Fiorina is opposed to it, while Whitman
favors abortion rights. California Republicans winning statewide
office in recent years -- such as Schwarzenegger and  Pete Wilson , who was governor in the 1990s -- have supported abortion
rights.  
 Whitman’s position on abortion is part of what makes her
“the kind of Republican who can win in California,” said Thad
Kousser, associate professor of political science at the
University of California, San Diego.  
 For Fiorina, it’s just one more issue to overcome.
