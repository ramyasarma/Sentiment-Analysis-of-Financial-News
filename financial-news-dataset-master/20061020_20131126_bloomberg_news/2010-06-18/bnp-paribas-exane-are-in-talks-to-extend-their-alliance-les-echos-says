             BNP Paribas SA and Exane are in
talks to extend their alliance, Les Echos reported, without
saying where it got the information.  
 The companies aim to extend their presence in mergers and
acquisitions in the U.K., and to generate cost savings in equity
derivatives, the newspaper said.
