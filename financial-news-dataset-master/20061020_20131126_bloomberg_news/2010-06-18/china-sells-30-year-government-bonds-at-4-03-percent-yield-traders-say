             China’s finance ministry sold 28
billion yuan ($4.1 billion) in 30-year bonds at an average yield
of 4.03 percent, according to traders at Industrial Bank Co. and
BOC International (China) Ltd. in Beijing.  
 The highest winning-bid yield at the sale was 4.12 percent,
said the traders at the primary dealers required to bid at the
government auctions.  
 The average yield at today’s auction was higher than the
4.015 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 13
finance companies.
