             Mexico’s peso is headed to a third
weekly gain, the longest winning streak in two months, on
speculation the European debt crisis will not derail economic
growth.  
 The peso rose 0.7 percent to 12.5665 per dollar at 8:55
a.m. New York time, from 12.6548 on June 11. The peso has
climbed 4.1 percent this year against the dollar, the best
performance among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The currency last gained for three weeks in the period ending
April 9. The peso gained 0.2 percent today.  
 “The only clear positive is that volatility is coming off,
which provides a more favorable backdrop for the currencies,”
said  Mike Moran , a New York-based senior currency strategist at
Standard Chartered Plc. “The general feeling is that risk is
back on, which I think is premature.”  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.26 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.1 centavo to 124.48 centavos per peso.
