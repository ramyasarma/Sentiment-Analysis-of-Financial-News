             ARM Holdings Plc , the chip designer
that rose last week to an eight-year high on takeover talk, is
more valuable as a standalone company and a buyer would be
wasting money, said Chief Executive Officer  Warren East .  
 “It makes no economic sense,” East said in an interview in
San Francisco. “The only reason you would want to do it would be
to shut it off from your competition.”  
 ARM ’s chip technology is at the heart of most of the
world’s smartphones such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone and its
customers include semiconductor makers Qualcomm Inc. and Texas
Instruments Inc. Licensees pay “tens of millions” for  ARM 
designs and have scant cause to pay the more than $5 billion it
would cost to clinch an acquisition, East says.  
 Customers share ARM’s research efforts and benefit from its
ability to design chips that are more efficient than those by
Intel Corp., East said. While the research is valuable to
multiple users, making the technology exclusive to a single
chipmaker wouldn’t generate a high enough return, he said.  
 “You might as well throw it on the fire,” East said of
money a buyer would have to spend.  
 ARM is best known for the technology behind the A4
processor that runs the iPhone. Yet the company is making
inroads in the market for  microcontrollers , small computers on
chips that control automobile engines, remote controls, power
tools and toys, East said. The capabilities of his processor
designs make ARM technology more attractive as it becomes
cheaper to produce in smaller chips, he said.  
 ARM fell 1.1 pence, or 0.4 percent, to 289.7 pence at the
end of trading in London yesterday, giving the Cambridge,
England-based company a market value of 3.8 billion pounds ($5.6
billion).
