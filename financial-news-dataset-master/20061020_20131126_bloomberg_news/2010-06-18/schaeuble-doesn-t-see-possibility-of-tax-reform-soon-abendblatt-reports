             Germany’s Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  doesn’t see enough fiscal leeway to enact a major tax
reform in the country during this legislative period,  Hamburger
Abendlatt  reported, citing an interview.  
 “You can’t do a big tax reform that’s neutral in terms of
government revenue, but you need some leeway for a tax relief,”
Schaeuble told the newspaper. “And I don’t see that leeway
during this parliamentary term.”  
 Schaeuble doesn’t favor ending lower rates on value-added
tax for food and hotels and some other items, according to the
report.
