             Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Europe’s
second-biggest airline, reached 70 percent of its annual savings
target as of June, program director Thomas Kluehr said in the
carrier’s employee magazine Lufthanseat.  
 The company will achieve the target of 300 million euros
($371 million) in cost cuts by the end of the year at its
passenger unit “if there are no major incidents,” Kluehr said.
Cologne, Germany-based Lufthansa will complete its Climb 2011
program with a 1 billion-euro cost reduction in 2012, he said,
according to the report.  
 The carrier is slashing costs as it tries to raise
operating profit in the face of depressed ticket prices and
rising fuel charges. The Climb 2011 savings program began in
July and includes cutting administrative jobs by 20 percent by
not replacing people who leave. The European airline industry
will be the only one globally to lose money this year even as
demand for air travel and freight transport picks up, the
International Air Transport Association said June 7.  
 “I am happy with the progress the project has made so
far,” Kluehr told Lufthanseat. “But we’ll need to be
tenacious. Cost cuts of this magnitude are the result of hard
and sustained effort.”  
 Lufthansa  rose  as much as 1.3 percent to 11.72 euros and
traded at 11.66 euros as of 1:43 p.m. in Frankfurt trading,
poised for the highest close since May 13. The stock has slipped
0.7 percent this year, giving the carrier a market value of 5.34
billion euros.  
 High kerosene prices and a weakening euro may mean the
airline will have to intensify its cost-savings efforts, Kluehr
said according to the report.
