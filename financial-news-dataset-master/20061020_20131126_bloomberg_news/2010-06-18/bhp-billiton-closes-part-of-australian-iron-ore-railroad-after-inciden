             BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
largest mining company, closed part of its main iron ore
railway in Western Australia’s Pilbara region after an
incident today.  
 “The affected part of our main rail line from Newman to
Port Hedland has been closed and all rail construction work
has been suspended until further notice,” BHP spokeswoman
 Fiona Martin  said in an e-mailed statement. Mining is
continuing.  
 Police are investigating the death of a man at the site
of the incident, Police Acting Inspector Graham Clifford said
today by phone from Perth.  
 The 426-kilometer (265-mile)  railroad  is one of
Australia’s longest, privately owned lines, according to BHP.
The line takes ore from mines at Newman to the port of Port
Hedland for export. A typical train will haul 26,000 metric
tons of ore and can be as long as 3.75 kilometers.  
 BHP rose 0.8 percent to A$39.13 at the 4:10 p.m. Sydney
time close on the Australian stock exchange. The benchmark
gained 0.5 percent.  
 BHP is the  third-largest exporter  of iron ore, behind
Brazil’s Vale SA and London’s Rio Tinto Group, which also has
most of its iron ore operations in the Pilbara.
