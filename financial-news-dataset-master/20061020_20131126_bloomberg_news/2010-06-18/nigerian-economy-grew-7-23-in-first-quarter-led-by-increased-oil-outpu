             Nigeria ’s economy grew 7.2 percent
in the first quarter of the year, up from 4.5 percent in the
same period a year earlier, as oil production increased
following the restoration of peace in the Niger Delta.  
 Growth in the oil and natural gas industry was 3.2 percent
in the three months compared with a decline of 8.1 percent a
year ago, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said in a statement
e-mailed from the capital, Abuja, today.  
 A drop in rebel activities in the oil-rich delta since
October helped to increase production by 9.6 percent during the
quarter to 202.4 million barrels.  
 “The oil sector story is particularly emphatic, showing a
complete reversal” from the previous year, Pabina Yinkere, a
Lagos-based analyst with  Access Bank Plc , said in a telephone
interview.  
 Oil and gas account for 16 percent of gross domestic
product in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and the
fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. Companies including
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Eni SpA , operate
joint ventures with the state-owned  Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp.   
 Militants who say they are battling for more of the
region’s resources called for an indefinite cease-fire in
October as fighters accepted an amnesty offer by then-President
 Umaru Yar’Adua .  
 Non-oil industries grew 8.2 percent from 7.9 percent a year
earlier, according to the statistics bureau. Agriculture, which
accounted for 42 percent of GDP last year, grew by 5.5 percent.
