             Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other
international retailers will possibly enter the South African
market and have been “very active in engagement” with local
operators, Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. Chairman Gareth Ackerman said.  
 New entrants would have profound implications for the South
African retail market, Ackerman said in a copy of speech to be
presented at the company’s annual general meeting in Cape Town
today.
