             Russian wheat exports are lagging
behind last year’s pace because of limited infrastructure,
financial constraints on farmers and marginal land, a unit of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a  report .  
 Exporters shipped 15.434 million metric tons from July 1
through April 30, the USDA’s Foreign Agriculture Service said in
the report. That’s down from 16.225 million tons during the same
period a year earlier, USDA data show.
