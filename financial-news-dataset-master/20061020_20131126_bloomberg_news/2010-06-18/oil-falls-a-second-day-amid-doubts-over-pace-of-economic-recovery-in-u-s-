             Crude oil futures fell for a second
day to trade around $76 a barrel in New York as the dollar
strengthened and concerns persisted that fuel supplies in the
U.S. are excessive.  
 Crude may advance next week after U.S. gasoline consumption
climbed to the highest level in nine months, a Bloomberg News
survey showed. The commodity lost 1.1 percent yesterday after
the Labor Department said the number of Americans seeking
jobless benefits last week climbed to a one-month high. U.S.
crude inventories are 8.4 percent above their seasonal norm,
according to the Energy Department.  
 “The high and rising inventory levels reflect that the
market is still in oversupply,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst with Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “Financial
developments are more important than fundamentals right now in
supporting the price.”  
 Oil for July delivery fell as much as $1.23, or 1.6
percent, to $75.56 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and traded for $75.85 at 1:10 p.m.
London time. The contract is up 2.7 percent this week. Brent
crude for August settlement dropped $1.10 to $77.58 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  
 The euro fell to $1.2374 from $1.2389. A stronger dollar
decreases the investment appeal of commodities priced in the
U.S. currency.  
 Drilling Moratorium Impact  
 Global oil production may fall by 800,000 to 900,000
barrels a day if a moratorium on deepwater drilling spreads
beyond the U.S., Executive Director of the International Energy
Agency  Nobuo Tanaka  said today in the Japanese city of Fukui.  
 Tighter regulations because of the BP Plc oil spill in the
Gulf of Mexico may delay exploration projects, Tanaka said.  
 Initial jobless  applications  in the U.S. increased by
12,000 to 472,000 in the week ended June 12. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News projected 450,000 claims, according to the
median forecast. The number of people receiving unemployment
insurance rose, while those getting extended benefits dropped.  
 Oil may rise next week after U.S. demand climbed 1.6
percent to 9.34 million barrels a day last week, a Bloomberg
News survey showed. Eleven of 21 analysts, or 52 percent,
forecast crude will increase through June 25. Six respondents,
or 29 percent, predicted futures will be little changed and four
said prices will decline. Last week, 42 percent of analysts said
the market would gain.  
 Crude oil may extend a two-week rebound in New York if
prices can end this week above a Fibonacci level at $75.70 a
barrel, according to technical analysis by Petromatrix GmbH.  
 That corresponds to the half-way point in crude’s move this
year from a peak of $87.15 a barrel on May 3 to a low of $64.24
on May 20.
