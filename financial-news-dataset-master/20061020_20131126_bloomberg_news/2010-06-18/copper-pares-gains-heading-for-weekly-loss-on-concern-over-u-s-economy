             Copper erased early gains in Asia,
and headed for a weekly decline, after economic reports raised
concerns that the U.S. economic recovery is not as strong as
expected. Aluminum, zinc and lead dropped.  
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded 0.5
percent lower at $6,413 a metric ton at 3:13 p.m. in Singapore,
down 1 percent this week, after adding as much as 0.6 percent
earlier. Futures in Shanghai dropped for the first time in five
days, losing as much as 1.5 percent to 50,880 yuan ($7,452) a
ton, before ending at 50,930 yuan a ton.  
 “The global economic recovery is being called into
question,” Guo Weijun, an analyst at First Futures Brokerage
Co., said from Guangzhou today. “There is further room to fall
as prices are weighed down by the ongoing debt crisis in Europe
and the slow seasonal demand period.”  
 Manufacturing in the region covered by the Philadelphia Fed
expanded in June at the slowest pace since August and initial
jobless claims increased by 12,000 to 472,000 in the week ended
June 12, data released yesterday showed. Reports on June 16
showed U.S. housing starts fell the most since March 2009 and
building permits, a sign of future construction, declined to a
one-year low.  
 “During this slow demand season, Chinese prices are
largely being led by what happens in the international
markets,” said Guo. “The poor performance of the Chinese stock
market is also affecting domestic sentiment.”  
 China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was set for a
weekly loss, as drugmakers slumped on government plans to curb
gains in medicine prices and consumer companies dropped on
concern employee protests will raise costs.  
 Aluminum in London fell 0.8 percent to $1,949.50 a ton,
zinc dropped 1.9 percent to $1,731 a ton and lead dropped 1.4
percent to $1,740 a ton. Nickel declined 0.5 percent to $19,710
a ton, and tin lost 0.5 percent to $17,651 a ton by 3:11 p.m.
Singapore time.
