             German stocks  dropped for a third
day on growing concern Europe’s debt crisis may harm the global
economic recovery.  
 Adidas AG , the world’s second-largest sporting goods maker,
and Siemens AG, Europe’s biggest engineering company, retreated
more than 2 percent after analysts downgraded the shares.
 Deutsche Bank AG  and Commerzbank AG, the country’s biggest
banks, followed European banking shares lower.  
 The  DAX Index  lost 1.4 percent to 6,115.48, while the
broader  HDAX Index  fell 1.5 percent. The DAX has climbed 7
percent following the European Union’s May 10 unveiling of a 750
billion-euro ($921 billion) loan package aimed at stopping the
euro region’s weakest members from defaulting. The measure has
still retreated 3.4 percent from this year’s high on April 26.  
 “European governments followed the right steps to support
indebted countries with a 750 billion rescue package but it
seems that investors don’t believe those countries can pay back
their debt entirely,” said  Philipp Musil , who helps oversee $10
billion at Semper Constantia Privatbank AG in Vienna. “We’re
just at the beginning of a very uncomfortable period where
governments and countries will have to save a lot of money to
pay back their debt.”  
 The Federal Reserve yesterday left the interbank lending
rate target unchanged in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where
it’s been since December 2008, after signaling that European
indebtedness may harm U.S. growth.  
 ‘Main Protagonist’  
 Germany is the “main protagonist” in the European debt
crisis and risks inflicting deflation on the euro region because
of its insistence on budget austerity, billionaire investor
 George Soros  said.  
 “As the strongest and most creditworthy country it is in
the driver’s seat,” Soros said in a speech at Humboldt
University in Berlin yesterday. “As a result Germany
objectively determines the financial and macroeconomic policies
of the euro zone without being subjectively aware of it. When
all the member countries try to be like Germany they are bound
to send the euro zone into a deflationary spiral.”  
 Adidas declined 4 percent to 40.99 euros as Kepler Capital
Markets lowered its recommendation to “reduce” from “hold.”
Rival  Nike Inc. , the world’s largest maker of athletic shoes,
dropped 3.7 percent to $69.82 at 11:57 a.m. in New York trading
after reporting fourth-quarter earnings late yesterday.  
 Siemens slid 2.7 percent to 75.20 euros as Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. LLC cut the engineering company to “market
perform” from “outperform.”  
 Banks Drop  
 Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank retreated 2.3 percent to
47.68 euros and 2.7 percent to 5.83 euros, respectively.
European banking shares lost 3.2 percent today for the worst
performance among 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  
 Porsche SE’s  preferred shares slid 3.6 percent to 35.08
euros as DZ Bank AG cut its recommendation on the stock to
“sell” from “buy” and reduced its price forecast by 43
percent to 31 euros.  
 E.ON AG, Germany’s biggest utility, dropped 2.1 percent to
23.27 euros. German electricity for delivery next year held
steady near its lowest level in two weeks.  
 KTG Agrar AG  surged 1.3 percent to 14.95 euros as the
company plans to pay its first dividend. The proposal is for a
payment of 10 cents per share, KTG Agrar said.  
 Roth & Rau AG  surged 3.4 percent to 22.60 euros after
receiving a 92 million-euro order for a wafer production system
from an Indian solar company.
