             Soybeans rose in Chicago, headed for
the first weekly gain in eight weeks as rainfall in Canada
delayed plantings of the canola crop, boosting demand for the
U.S. oilseed. Corn declined for the first time in three days.  
 Soybean futures in Chicago have risen 1.9 percent this
week, the first such gain since the week ended April 23. Excess
rain in Canada, the largest canola exporter, means as much as
12.5 million acres (4.9 million hectares) of farmland won’t be
planted this year, the Canadian Wheat Board said June 11.  
 “Wet conditions in Canada have pushed wheat as well as
soybeans,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager of research
at Tokyo-based IDO Securities Co. More rain is forecast in the
coming days, he said.  
 Soybeans for November delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent
to $9.29 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at
$9.265 a bushel at 11:40 p.m. Paris time.  
 Canola for November delivery traded on the ICE Futures
Canada exchange in Winnipeg dropped 1.4 percent to C$420.40
($407.93) a metric ton at 12:32 p.m. after touching C$428
yesterday, the highest level since Aug. 31. The contract is set
for a 5 percent climb this week.  
 Rapeseed for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 0.8 percent to 331.75 euros ($410.37) a ton, heading
for a 3.5 percent gain this week. Soybeans, rapeseed and canola,
a rapeseed variety, are used to produce animal feed, vegetable
oils and biodiesel.  
 Canada Rains  
 Korea Agro-Fisheries Trade Corp., a state-run food
importer, issued a tender to buy 30,000 tons of non-genetically
modified yellow soybeans for food use for delivery by Sept. 5.
The tender will be on June 24, according to a tender notice on
its website.  
 Wheat for September delivery fell 0.1 percent to $4.78 a
bushel. The contract has advanced 4.6 percent this week, the
second straight weekly gain, as rain curbed planting in Canada
and delayed harvesting in the southern Great Plains of the U.S.  
 Paris-traded milling wheat for November delivery rose 0.9
percent to 141.25 euros a ton, climbing 3.5 percent this week.  
 “The market should continue to find support from the
weather conditions in Canada, where new rain is expected
today,” French farm adviser Agritel said in an  online comment.   
 Farmers in Canada may seed 19.15 million acres of wheat,
the lowest since 1971 and 18 percent less than a year ago, the
CWB said in a  report  last week. Acres devoted to durum wheat
will total 3.4 million, the lowest since 1980 and a 39 percent
decline from last year, the CWB said.  
 In Saskatchewan, the top grain grower in Canada, 73 percent
of crops were seeded as of June 14, up from 70 percent a week
earlier, the province’s Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday.
Excessive rainfall slowed planting and has stressed crops, the
ministry said in a  report .  
 Corn for December delivery in Chicago shed 0.3 percent to
$3.7725 a bushel at 12:55 p.m. Paris time. The grain advanced
1.7 percent this week, gaining for the second week. The contract
touched $3.815 on June 16, the highest level since May 12.
