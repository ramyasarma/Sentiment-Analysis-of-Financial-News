             Key components of Australia’s planned
“super profits” tax on mining companies will be dumped by the
government, the West Australian said, without citing sources.  
 The government, intent on keeping a 40 percent tax rate for
the resource super profits tax and applying it to existing
projects, is poised to axe the idea of underwriting losses in
failed mining ventures, the West said. The government is
planning to “significantly” lift the threshold at which the 40
percent tax kicks in, from a planned 6 percent now, it said.  
 The government is also considering whether the threshold
could vary according to the mineral, the paper said. It may
allow mining companies to write-off capital expenditure before
it applied, it said.
