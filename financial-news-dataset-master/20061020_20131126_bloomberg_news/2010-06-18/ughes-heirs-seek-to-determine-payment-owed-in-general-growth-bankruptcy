             The heirs of  Howard Hughes  sought
court permission to determine a payment they say they’re owed by
 General Growth Properties Inc. , the bankrupt U.S. mall owner,
which acquired assets once belonging to the Hughes Corp.  
 The Hughes heirs, which are part of a larger group of
 creditors , want to complete a process for quantifying the
payment and if necessary go to arbitration to settle their
claim, they said in a court filing today.  
 “Any attempt to deprive the Hughes heirs of the benefit of
their bargain -- including the streamlined valuation and
arbitration procedures -- would effectively be an inappropriate
transfer to other constituencies in this case of the Hughes
heirs’ valuable contractual rights,” they said.  
 The heirs’ involvement in the General Growth  bankruptcy 
stems from the mall owner’s 2004 acquisition of the Rouse Co.,
which had acquired Hughes Corp. in 1996. General Growth, at the
time, assumed an agreement that would pay the Hughes heirs and
others over time.  
 The group said it’s entitled to half of the appraised fair-
market value of certain unsold real estate assets. In today’s
court filing, the group didn’t put a value on what it says it’s
owed. The group also has filed claims for other payments,
according to court papers.  
 David Keating , a spokesman for General Growth, declined to
comment.
