             Arabica coffee rose, capping the
biggest weekly gain since 2006, amid tight supplies and quality
problems with the crop in Brazil, the world’s biggest grower.
Robusta prices also gained in London, and cocoa rose.  
 Coffee futures climbed to a 27-month high in New York,
while prices in London have rallied 17 percent this month.
Brazilian farmers are having quality issues with the crop that
will keep supplies “limited,” said  Judith Ganes-Chase , a
Katonah, New York-based commodity consultant.  
 “The physical market is tight,” said Ganes-Chase. “The
Brazilian crop isn’t going to save the market from itself here.
There just isn’t that much coffee around.”  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 4.3 cents, or
2.7 percent, to $1.621 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Prices jumped 11 percent this week, the biggest such gain since
Jan. 6, 2006. Earlier, prices touched $1.6305, the highest level
for a most-active contract since March 6, 2008.  
 Robusta-coffee futures for September gained $20, or 1.3
percent, to $1,571 a metric ton on London’s Liffe exchange.  
 Compared to the arabica market, robusta supplies are bigger
because of stockpiles in supplier and consumer markets,  Kona Haque , an analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd. in London, wrote in
a report this week. The variety is used in instant coffees and
blends.  
 “The extent of the surge was mostly due to technical
factors, and this could mean that an equally sharp retraction
could be on the cards,” researcher F.O. Licht said in a note
released today and dated June 17.  
 Through June 16, coffee  stockpiles  have declined 27 percent
this year to 2.3 million bags in warehouses monitored by ICE.  
 In New York, cocoa for September delivery advanced $3, or
0.1 percent, to $2,957 a ton. The chocolate ingredient climbed
0.7 percent this week, the first such gain this month. On Liffe,
cocoa for July delivery rose 38 pounds, or 1.6 percent, to 2,456
pounds ($3,637) a ton.
