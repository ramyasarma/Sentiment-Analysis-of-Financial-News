             Zain Kenya Ltd. , a unit of  Bharti
Airtel , said its plan to start offering third-generation phone
services in Kenya is at a “very advanced stage” and welcomed the
East African country’s reduction of license fees.  
 The Communications Commission of Kenya last week reduced
the cost of a 3G permit by 60 percent to $10 million to boost
competition in the industry.  
 “This is a giant step in the effort to make Kenya the ICT
hub for Africa,” Managing Director Rene Meza said today in a
statement published in the  Daily Nation  newspaper. The previous
fee of $25 million “was prohibitive and served as an entry
barrier for other operators,” he said.  
 Safaricom Ltd. , Kenya’s biggest mobile-network operator and
owner of the country’s only 3G license, plans to seek a rebate
after it paid $25 million in 2007 to acquire its permit, the
Business Daily newspaper reported on June 11, citing Chief
Executive Officer  Michael Joseph .  
 Safaricom competes with Zain, Telkom Kenya Ltd., a unit of
 France Telecom SA  in a partnership with the government, and
Essar Telecom Kenya Ltd., a unit of India’s Essar Group.
