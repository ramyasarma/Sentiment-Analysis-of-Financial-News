             Hong Kong stocks  advanced, driving
the Hang Seng Index to its longest winning streak in more than
four years, as a Spanish bond sale eased concerns about Europe’s
debt crisis.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, gained 1.1
percent, while London-based  Standard Chartered Plc  climbed 3.8
percent.  Zijin Mining Group Co. , China’s largest gold producer,
rose 3.2 percent as bullion traded near a record high. Tencent
Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest Internet company by market value,
jumped 3.8 percent after China Business News said the company
agreed to develop services with Cisco Systems Inc.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  closed 0.7 percent higher at 20,286.71
in Hong Kong, the highest level since May 13. The  index  has
risen 2.1 percent in the past five days, the most since the week
ended April 9. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of Chinese
companies’ so-called H-shares added 0.3 percent to 11,622.69.  
 “There was a lot of pessimism about what’s happening in
Europe that took the market down,” said  Tim Leung , who helps
manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“It’s rebounding from that pessimism.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  slumped 7.3 percent this year, as
worries about budget deficits in Europe and credit tightening by
China dented confidence in strength of the global economy.
Shares on the benchmark index are priced at an average  13.4
times  estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Eight-Day Streak  
 June futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.9 percent to
20,378. The gauge today completed its eighth straight advance,
the longest winning streak since the 10 trading days to Feb. 27,
2006. The streak four years ago came amid optimism that a cycle
of interest-rate increases in Hong Kong was coming to an end.  
 Stocks with ties to Europe advanced after Spain sold 3.5
billion euros ($4.3 billion) of bonds, the maximum set for the
auction, as a decline in prices enticed buyers and eased concern
that it will struggle to finance looming debt maturities.  
 Standard Chartered  advanced 3.8 percent to HK$202.  HSBC 
increased 1.1 percent to HK$74.85. The company sold $3.4 billion
of perpetual securities with a coupon of 8 percent, according to
a person familiar with the matter.  
 “Investors are less worried about European governments
failing to pay their debt,” said  Francis Lun , general manager
at Fulbright Securities Co.  
 Record Gold Prices  
 Gold producers gained as the price of the metal for
immediate delivery traded little changed at $1,244.72. Bullion
jumped as much as 1.8 percent to $1,251.25 yesterday, near an
all-time high of $1,252.11 on June 8. Zijin Mining rose 3.2
percent to HK$5.87. Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. jumped 5.2
percent to HK$18.10.  
 Gold may climb to $1,300 an ounce this year as investment
demand shifts from the euro and the dollar,  Bruce Ikemizu , the
head of commodity trading and managing director at Standard Bank
Plc’s Tokyo branch, said in an interview yesterday.  
 Tencent surged 3.8 percent to HK$129.70, the second-biggest
 advance  in the Hang Seng Index today. The company signed a
memorandum of understanding with Cisco Systems Inc. to jointly
develop data and communications services in China, China
Business News reported on its website today.  
 Some textile companies climbed after Credit Suisse Group AG
rated the stocks “outperform.”  
 Shenzhou International Group Holdings Ltd. , a textile
company, surged 8.1 percent to HK$8.97.  Texhong Textile Group
Ltd.  advanced 3.6 percent to HK$3.48, while  Pacific Textile
Holdings Ltd.  increased 8.4 percent to HK$3.99.  Victory City
International Holdings Ltd.  soared 15 percent to HK$1.77.  
 Credit Suisse analysts assigned the companies
“outperform” ratings in new coverage, saying a supply shortage
and the ability of manufacturers to pass on cost increases will
bolster the Hong Kong and China textile industry over the next
six-to-12 months.  
 Henderson Land Development Co.  sank 1.1 percent to HK$46.20.
The stock was the third-biggest drag on the Hang Seng Index
after the government said regulatory and law enforcement
authorities are “looking into and following up on” 20 canceled
apartment sales at one of the company’s projects. Henderson
slumped 2.3 percent yesterday after the cancellations were
announced.
