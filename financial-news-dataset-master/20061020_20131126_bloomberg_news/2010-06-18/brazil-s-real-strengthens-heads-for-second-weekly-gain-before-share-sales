             Brazil’s real rose, heading for a
second weekly gain, on speculation share sales by the country’s
state-controlled oil company and the continent’s biggest lender
will boost demand for the currency.  
 The real rose 1.7 percent to 1.7802 per dollar at 8:31 a.m.
New York time, from 1.8107 on June 11. The currency jumped 3
percent last week. The real increased 0.2 percent today.  
 “We’re seeing traders holding back their dollar purchases
until huge share sales are defined by Petrobras and Banco do
Brasil,” said  Francisco Carvalho , head trader at Sao Paulo-
based BGC Liquidez DTVM, the country’s second-largest currency
brokerage.  
 Banco do Brasil SA , Latin America’s biggest bank by assets,
plans to price on June 29 the sale of 286 million new shares,
valued at 7.8 billion reais ($4.39 billion) based on yesterday’s
closing price.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 11.30 percent.
