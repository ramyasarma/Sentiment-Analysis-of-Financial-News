             LG Electronics Inc. , South
Korea’s second-largest electronics maker, plans to invest 1
trillion won ($828 million) by 2015 in its solar cell
business.  
 The Seoul-based company aims to generate revenue of 3
trillion won by 2015 and boost production capacity to almost
1 gigawatt within three years, from 240 megawatts at the end
of this year, according to a statement today.  
 LG completed construction of a solar cell production
line in 2008 and plans to add another this year. The company
began production this year and is selling the cells in Europe
and South Korea, according to the statement.  
 LG Group, South Korea’s fourth-largest industrial group,
said in April it plans to invest 20 trillion won by 2020 to
cut the group’s greenhouse-gas emissions and develop energy-
saving products.
