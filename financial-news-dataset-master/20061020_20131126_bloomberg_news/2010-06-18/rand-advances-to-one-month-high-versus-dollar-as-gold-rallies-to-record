             South Africa’s rand gained to the
strongest level in a month as gold rallied to a record and
investors speculated Europe’s debt crisis will be contained,
spurring demand for higher-yielding  assets.  
 The currency rose as much as 1 percent to 7.5175 per
dollar, the strongest intraday level since May 18. The rand
traded 0.4 percent higher at 7.5592 by 4:20 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a close of 7.5908 yesterday, extending this
week’s gain to 1.7 percent.  
 Concern that European governments will struggle to fund
deficits eased yesterday after Spain sold the maximum amount of
bonds set for its auction. Investors’ growing comfort with
measures taken by the region’s banks to improve their financial
strength has bolstered the euro, and the resulting weaker dollar
has seen precious metals prices rise, Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s
 Michael Keenan  wrote in a client note today.  
 Sentiment is “slightly better” and “generally people buy
back into the currency then,”  Marc Copeland , a currency trader
at Investec Capital Markets, said in a phone interview from Cape
Town today. “The Spanish bond auction yesterday encouraged
investors.”  
 Gold, one of South Africa’s largest foreign exchange
earners, for immediate delivery reached a record $1,259.68 an
ounce, while spot platinum traded as high as $1,582.25 an ounce.
In 2009 gold production in the country earned 48.7 billion rand,
according to the Chamber of Mines of South Africa.
Government bonds rose, with the benchmark 13.5 percent security
due September 2015 adding 13 cents to 123.36 rand. The yield on
the bond fell 3 basis points to 7.94 percent.
