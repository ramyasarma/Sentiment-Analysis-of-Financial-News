             BP Plc  has appointed an internal
team to review BP’s U.S. portfolio and select $20 billion in
assets that will be used to guarantee a fund it will set up to
pay oil spill claims,  Robert Dudley , BP managing director, said
in an interview at BP’s Washington office.  
 In an agreement worked out with President  Barack Obama  on
June 16, BP agreed to contribute $20 billion over four years to
a fund that will be used to pay people who have suffered losses
related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The move was intended
to reassure the U.S. government that BP will stand by its
pledges to pay for the damage caused by the spill, while at the
same time clearing up uncertainty for BP shareholders and
creditors, Chief Financial Officer  Byron Grote  said at the time.  
 BP appointed Dudley, a U.S. citizen, to take charge of
cleanup operations related to the spill in the Gulf of Mexico
earlier this month. Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  will
remain in charge of the company. Dudley said Hayward has shown
strong leadership “from the very beginning” of the disaster.  
 It will “take a long time” to restore BP’s image in the
U.S., Dudley said. To start, BP needs to plug the leaking well;
clean up the oil from the water and the beaches and meet the
company’s commitments in the region, he said. BP will play a
role in improving “the safety of oil and gas drilling around the
world,” he said.  
 Dudley said BP will need to divest assets and trim capital
spending to “pace ourselves for what happened in the U.S.” BP,
which has been a leader in deep-water drilling and in projects
in countries such as Iraq and Libya, “still has the capacity to
operate on the frontiers,” he said.
