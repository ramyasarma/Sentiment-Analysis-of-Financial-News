             Companies in Europe sold 23 percent
more bonds this week after a successful fundraising by Spain
eased concerns the region’s government deficit crisis will
worsen and hurt corporate earnings.  
 RTE EDF Transport SA, the region’s largest power network,
and water utility Suez Environnement SA led 10.3 billion euros
($13 billion) of note sales, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, compared with 8.4 billion euros last week and an
average for the year of 12.2 billion euros. Cognac maker  Remy
Cointreau SA  said it plans to raise 200 million euros in
Europe’s first high-yield offering in more than a month.  
 “Good deals for good companies will get done,” said
 Kenton Jernigan , managing director and head of European credit
sales at Jefferies International Ltd. in London.  
 Spain’s sale of 3.5 billion euros of bonds eased concern
it will struggle to finance looming debt maturities. The extra
yield investors demand to hold investment-grade corporate debt
rather than government securities fell three basis points to
205, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  
 RTE in Paris sold 750 million euros of 12-year notes that
were priced to yield 85 basis points more than the benchmark
swap rate. The issuer last tapped the market with a 1.25
billion- euro, seven-year issue in May 2008 at a spread of 48
basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company is ranked A+ by Standard & Poor’s, the fifth-highest
investment-grade rating.  
 Investor Demand  
 Suez raised 500 million euros of 12-year notes that were
priced to yield 108 basis points over swaps in its first
benchmark sale in almost a year. Europe’s second-biggest water
company paid a spread of 160 basis points when it offered 500
million euros of 15-year notes in July 2009. The company is
ranked A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, the seventh highest
investment-grade level.  
 “There is good investor demand for safe, highly-rated
credits especially from the core countries,” said Maureen
Schuller, a senior credit strategist at ING Groep NV. “We’re on
the brink of seeing further corporate issuance as confidence
returns to the market.”  
 America Movil SAB  made its debut in the euro and pound bond
markets when the largest wireless carrier in Latin America
raised a total $3 billion in a three-part note sale.  
 The Mexico-city based company sold 1 billion euros of seven
year bonds priced at 135 basis points more than the swap rate,
and 750 million euros of 12-year notes yielding 175 basis
points. The 650 million pounds ($965 million) of notes due in 20
years were priced at 165 basis points over U.K. gilts.  
 Carlos Slim  
 America Movil is controlled by Carlos Slim, the world’s
richest person according to Forbes, and is ranked A2 by Moody’s
Investors Service, the sixth-highest investment-grade rating.  
 Banks returned to the market as the cost of insuring
financial company debt in the credit-default swaps market
dropped to the lowest in a month.  Credit Suisse Group AG  added
550 million euros to its 4.75 percent bonds due August 2019,
while Deutsche Bank AG raised 1 billion euros from a lower Tier
2 note offering.  
 The subordinated securities from Germany’s biggest lender
“received good demand, which is positive for the market,” said
ING’s Schuller. The sale garnered about 1.7 billion euros in
orders, according to a person with knowledge of the sale.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold debt from
financial companies rather than government notes fell four basis
points this week to 258 basis points, Bank of America’s EMU
financial corporate index shows.  
 Renault Finance  
 RCI Banque SA, the financial unit of France’s second-
biggest carmaker Renault SA, raised 500 million euros of three-
year bonds. They currently trade 4 basis points tighter at 249
basis points over swaps, according to Rabobank Nederland NV
prices on Bloomberg.  
 Paris-based Remy Cointreau said it plans to sell six-year
bonds yielding about 5.625 percent as it redeems 192 million
euros of 5.2 percent notes that mature in January 2012. The
liquor company is offering holders of its 2012 notes 1,015 euros
per 1,000-euro security, according to a statement.  
 Remy Cointreau is rated Ba2 by Moody’s, two-levels below
investment grade, and a step lower at BB- by Standard & Poor’s.
High-yield bond issuance dropped 85 percent in May to $1.3
billion compared with the previous month, Bloomberg data show.
