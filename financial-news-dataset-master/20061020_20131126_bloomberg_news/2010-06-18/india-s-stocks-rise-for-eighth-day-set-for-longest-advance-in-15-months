             India’s benchmark stock index rose
for an eighth day, set for the longest stretch of gains in 15 
months, as investors bought shares in companies that may benefit 
from accelerating economic growth.  
 Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , the nation’s biggest engineering
company, climbed to its highest in more than two years.  Tata
Power Co. , the largest non-state electricity generator, advanced
1.2 percent. India’s economy can grow by as much as 10 percent
annually in coming years, Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chairman of
the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said yesterday.  
 “More and more people are convinced that this domestic
growth story will play out strongly and that 24 months down the
road, these stocks will look cheap,” said Gajendra Nagpal,
chief executive officer at Unicon Financial Intermediaries Pvt.
“That’s why plenty of institutional money is flowing into the
market now.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 65.67, or 0.4 percent, to 17,682.36 at 11 a.m. in Mumbai.
The gauge has climbed 3.6 percent this week, poised for its
biggest weekly advance this year. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the
National Stock Exchange rose 0.4 percent to 5,293.70. The  BSE
200 Index  increased 0.4 percent to 2,232.16.  
 Larsen & Toubro gained 2.2 percent to 1,815.9 rupees,
poised for its highest close since February 2008. Tata Power
advanced 1.5 percent to 1,279.95 rupees.  
 ‘Clear Signal’  
 There’s a “clear signal” that India can achieve a
forecast annual gross domestic product growth rate of between 9
percent and 10 percent, Rangarajan said yesterday. That compares
with last year’s 7.4 percent pace.  
 Emerging market equities got the second-largest net inflows
this year in the week to June 16 as investors’ risk appetite
returned, EPFR Global said in an e-mailed statement. Fitch
Ratings raised the credit rating outlook for local currency debt
to “stable” from “negative” this week, citing India’s
“strong growth prospects” and a reduction in the debt-to-gross
domestic product ratio as the government collects higher-than-
expected revenue.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  8.58 billion rupees  ($186
million) of Indian equities June 16, increasing total purchases
of the stocks this year to 249.7 billion rupees, according to
the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.
