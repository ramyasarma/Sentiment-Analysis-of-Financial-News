             Business tax receipts in German
municipalities fell 20 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing data from the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden.  
 Tax revenue dropped to 6.8 billion euros ($8.4 billion)
from 8.5 billion euros in 2009, according to the report.
Business tax receipts in cities, which make up a comparatively
small share of total receipts, are not included in the data, the
newspaper said.
