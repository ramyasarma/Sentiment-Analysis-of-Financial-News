             Andy’s leaving for college and his
toys don’t know what to do. Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Mr. and Mrs.
Potato Head and the gang hope to go with him, but suspect
they’ll end up in the attic or even the trash.  
 If you’ve had a kid or been a kid -- or just been a movie
lover -- over the past 15 years, you’ll know what this means.
“ Toy Story 3 ” is another funny, heartwarming visit with a
group of toys who take their jobs seriously.  
 Their jobs? As Woody (voiced by  Tom Hanks ), the group’s
chief executive, says at one of their “staff meetings”: “This
job isn’t about being played with. It’s about being there for
Andy.” If that means spending years in the attic gathering
dust, so be it.  
 But that wouldn’t make much of a movie. Through a series of
mixups, the toys end up being donated to the Sunnyside Daycare
Center, whose rainbow palette hides a regime resembling Attica
more than Sesame Street. Not for the children, who seem
perfectly happy, but for the toys.  
 Lots-O’-Huggin’ Bear, known as Lotso, is a plush pink
dictator who rules Sunnyside with an iron fist and the Southern
drawl of Ned Beatty. He throws Andy’s toys to the wolves -- or,
more accurately, the toddlers -- who use cowgirl Jessie ( Joan Cusack ) as a paintbrush, separate the Potato Heads ( Don Rickles 
and Estelle Harris) from their plug-in parts, and terrorize the
toys with all the enthusiasm of extreme youth.  
 ‘Dream Weaver’  
 Director Lee Unkrich, screenwriter  Michael Arndt  and their
team provide Pixar’s usual attention to detail. When Andy’s
sister’s Barbie meets Ken ( Michael Keaton ) at Sunnyside, the
Earth moves for both of them. To the sounds of “Dream Weaver,”
Ken emerges from his Dream House in vintage turquoise shorts and
a leopard-print shirt.  
 “Love your leg warmers,” he tells his perfect woman.  
 “Nice ascot,” she replies.  
 The pace speeds up once Woody and the gang decide to escape
from Sunnyside. The only way out is through the garbage chute,
and the toys wind up on a slow ride to the incinerator (which
makes the film’s best use of 3-D) before reaching their well-
deserved happy ending.  
 The filmmakers at  Pixar Animation Studios  find a way for
Woody and Co. to “be there” for the grownup Andy while
bringing joy to their new owner, an imaginative little girl.
Like “The Incredibles” and “Up,” “Toy Story 3” speaks to
adults and children about larger questions of love and loyalty
while taking them on a rollicking adventure.

 ‘Jonah Hex’  
 Jonah Hex isn’t your typical Western gunslinger. He’s got a
hideously scarred face, straps two Gatling guns to his saddle
and talks to the dead.  
 Josh Brolin  brings the sardonic comic-book antihero to life
in “ Jonah Hex ,” but the rest of this strange  Clint Eastwood / M. Night Shyamalan  hybrid is pretty lifeless.  
 The troubled production lost its original co-directors and
required some reshooting, which may explain its truncated 82-
minute length. The jumbled final product, officially directed by
Jimmy Hayward, looks like something stitched together by
committee.  
 Brolin, who once called the script “awful,” is the film’s
saving grace. He pulls off the macho swagger and deadpan one-
liners of the 1870s bounty hunter with the ease of an old-
fashioned Western star.  
 John Malkovich  does his twisted evil shtick as Quentin
Turnbull, the Confederate loyalist who murdered Hex’s family and
mutilated him with a branding iron.  Megan Fox  supplies the sex
appeal as a crafty prostitute who helps Hex seek revenge against
Turnbull and stop him from destroying the country with a
doomsday weapon.  
 Hex can bring the dead back to life, but he can’t save this
movie.
