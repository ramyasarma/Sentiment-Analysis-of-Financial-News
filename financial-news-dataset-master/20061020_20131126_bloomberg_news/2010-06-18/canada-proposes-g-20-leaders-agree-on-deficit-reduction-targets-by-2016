             Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper has proposed that the Group of 20 nations agree to
putting their debt-to-GDP ratios on a downward path by 2016,
Harper spokesman Dimitri Soudas said.  
 Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, Soudas said Harper has
written another letter to his G-20 counterparts ahead of their
June 26-27 meeting in Toronto that says the countries should put
together credible plans for fiscal consolidation.
