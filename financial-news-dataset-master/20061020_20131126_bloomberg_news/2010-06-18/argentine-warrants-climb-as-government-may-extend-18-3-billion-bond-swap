             Argentine warrants rose for an
eighth day, the longest streak since March, as Economy Minister
 Amado Boudou  said the government may again extend its offer to
restructure $18.3 billion in defaulted bonds held out of a 2005
settlement.  
 The dollar-denominated GDP warrants rose 0.08 cent on the
dollar to 7.93 cents at 9:29 a.m. New York time, the highest
level since April 26.  
 Argentina may extend the swap offer past its June 22
deadline if the government feels that the exchange is
progressing well, Boudou told Buenos Aires-based newspaper El
Cronista.  
 Economy Ministry spokesman Sergio Poggi, returning today
from a trip to meet with creditors in Italy with Finance
Secretary  Hernan Lorenzino , did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.  
 Lorenzino said at a June 16 press conference in Milan that
he was confident the swap offer will be accepted by the holders
of at least 60 percent of defaulted notes. He also said the
deadline wouldn’t be extended.  
 Argentina’s restructuring offer includes warrants linked to
economic growth, as well as dollar bonds due in 2033 and bonds
due in 2017 to pay past-due interest. The offer doesn’t include
past-due payments on the GDP warrants.  
 Italian Creditors  
 Italy is home to up to $4 billion in defaulted bonds,
according to the Argentine government. Earlier this week,
Lorenzino traveled to Tokyo, where he met with Japanese bankers
and government officials.  
 Creditors have turned in most of the remaining Japanese-law
bonds, bringing total participation to 99 percent, the Economy
Ministry said in a June 15 statement.  
 As of June 11, creditors tendered about 56 percent of the
outstanding bonds, Poggi said on June 14.  
 President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  opened the debt
swap May 3, five years after her husband and predecessor,  Nestor Kirchner , offered creditors about 30 cents on the dollar, the
harshest restructuring terms since at least World War II,
according to  Arturo Porzecanski , an international finance
professor at American University in Washington. The exchange was
originally slated to close June 7.  
 Argentina defaulted on $95 billion in 2001 and a successful
restructuring will help the country regain access to
international credit markets. It will also lower borrowing costs
for provinces and companies that seek to sell debt.  
 The peso was little changed at 3.9257 per dollar, from
3.9244 yesterday. The currency has declined 0.1 percent this
week.
