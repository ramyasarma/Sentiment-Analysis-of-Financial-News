             Brazilian Energy Ministry official
Marco Antonio Almeida said it is “indispensable” that  Petroleo
Brasileiro  SA offers new shares at the same time as the
government swaps oil for the state-controlled company’s stock.  
 “Things will have to match somehow, this marriage looks
indispensable to me,” Almeida, the ministry’s secretary for
Oil, Gas and Renewable Fuels, said yesterday in an interview in
Brasilia. “Either the capital increase happens a bit later or
we succeed in accelerating the oil pricing process,” he said.  
 Petrobras  said on June 11 it plans to sell stock by the end
of July to finance investments and wants to swap about 5 billion
barrels of government-owned oil for stock. The Brazilian oil
regulator, known as the ANP, is expected to hire a private
consulting company to assess the reserves by June 25 and it will
request that the job is done “as fast as possible,” according
to Almeida. Energy Minister  Marcio Zimmerman  said June 10 the
country expected to set the price for the reserves by October.  
 Petrobras, whose planned share sale is set to be the
biggest in the Western Hemisphere in at least a decade, is
seeking to fund as much as $220 billion of spending through
2014, the world’s biggest oil-industry investment program, to
develop reserves including Tupi, the largest discovery in the
Americas since Mexico’s Cantarell in 1976.
