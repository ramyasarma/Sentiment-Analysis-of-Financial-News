             An overhaul of the U.S. mortgage-
finance system “should rise to the top of the agenda” as soon
as Congress finishes its rewrite of financial-industry rules,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman  Sheila Bair  said today.  
 Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the mortgage firms 80 percent
owned by the federal government, should be reshaped as part of a
broader effort to make the nation’s housing policy “more
definitive about where the financial obligation of taxpayers
begins and ends,” Bair said in  prepared remarks  at the
University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School in Philadelphia.  
 “The goal must be to clarify once and for all which
functions should be governmental, and which are strictly subject
to the discipline of the marketplace,” Bair said.  
 The House and Senate have passed regulatory bills in
response to an economic crisis that led to the September 2008
government takeover of Washington-based Fannie Mae and McLean,
Virginia-based Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee more than
half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market. Lawmakers have
largely excluded housing finance from the overhaul, leaving it
to be addressed after the bill is signed into law, according to
Representative  Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat who is
leading talks on the legislation.
