             Poland’s economy is “doomed” to
cope with a strengthening currency in the long term, central
bank Governor  Marek Belka  said in an interview with Gazeta
Wyborcza.  
 The bank’s April currency purchase, its first zloty
intervention in 12 years, didn’t target any specific exchange
rate, Belka told Gazeta. “Such operations may occur but they
are not the rule,” he told the Warsaw-based newspaper.  
 Belka also said he expects the government to present an
“ambitious” budget plan for 2011 as the economy’s recovery
outlook necessitates tighter fiscal policies, according to
Gazeta. The central bank will “not to tolerate inflation,” he
told the newspaper. The May annual  inflation rate  of 2.2 percent,
reported June 15, doesn’t change the monetary policy outlook, he
told Gazeta.
