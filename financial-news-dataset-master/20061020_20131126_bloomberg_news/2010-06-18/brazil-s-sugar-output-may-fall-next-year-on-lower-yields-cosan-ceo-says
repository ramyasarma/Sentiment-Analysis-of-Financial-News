             Brazil’s sugar production may
decline next year, prompting prices to rise 15 percent as soon
as the fourth quarter, according to  Cosan SA Industria &
Comercio , the world’s top cane processor.  
 Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the world’s largest
producing region, may be lower than this year’s 28 million
metric tons, Cosan Chief Executive Officer  Marcos Lutz  said in
an interview yesterday at his office in Sao Paulo. Futures may
increase to 18 cents a pound starting in October from 15.6
yesterday in New York, Lutz said.  
 “People are expecting sugar output in Brazil to grow next
year, but most mills didn’t invest to fertilize or renew sugar-
cane fields,” Lutz said today. “Yields are going to suffer.”  
 Futures have plunged 43 percent in New York this year on
expectation favorable weather will lead Brazil and India, the
world’s largest growers, to harvest record crops. Raw sugar for
October delivery fell 1.4 percent to 15.38 cents per pound on
ICE Futures U.S. at 2:27 p.m. in New York.  
 Sugar-cane yields may fall this year because many mills,
lacking cash, failed to invest in maintenance, Lutz said. Cane
output for the current crop, which runs through November, may
also be lower than expected on lack of rains, he said.  
 “It’s been a very dry season which will be good for
sucrose content, but bad for crop yields,” he said. Sucrose is
the substance that is processed into sugar and ethanol.  
 Output of 580 Million Tons  
 This year’s output may be close to 580 million metric tons
of sugar-cane in the Center-South, down from 595.9 million tons
estimated by industry association  Unica  on March 31, according
to Lutz. Sugar production, he said, may be 2.5 million tons
lower than expected, or 7.3 percent lower than Unica’s last
estimate of 34.1 million tons.  
 Cosan  grows sugar-cane in an area of about 600,000 hectares
(2,316 square miles), bigger than the state of Delaware. It
produces sugar and ethanol from 23 sugar-cane processing plants,
four sugar refineries and ships through two port terminals.  
 In 2008, the company acquired  Exxon Mobil Corp .’s fuel-
distribution assets in Brazil for $826 million while in
February, it agreed with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  to combine
ethanol, sugar and fuel distribution assets in Brazil.
