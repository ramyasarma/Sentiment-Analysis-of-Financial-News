             Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
reopened the first of 35  Cada brand  supermarkets, previously
majority-owned by France’s  Casino Guichard Perrachon SA , as the
state boosts its control over the distribution of food in an
attempt to rein in spiraling inflation.  
 Chavez, who toured the market today and highlighted the
difference in price of basic goods sold by the state and
“capitalist” businesses, said the supermarkets will now be
known as “Abastos Bicentenarios,” Spanish for Bicentennial
Bodega.  
 “We’re increasing the production and distribution of food
to satisfy the needs of the people. What was capitalist is now
socialist,” Chavez said in a nationwide broadcast on  television 
and radio. “We’re removing the label of merchandise from food
and lowering prices.”  
 Chavez nationalized Casino’s Exito hypermarkets and Cada
stores in January after accusing the company of illegally
raising prices after a devaluation of the bolivar. The
government has increased expropriations of food distributors and
threatened the country’s largest food maker,  Empresas Polar SA ,
in a bid to resolve sporadic shortages and quell the fastest
inflation rate of 78 economies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 The other markets seized this year should all be open or
will open in the coming days, the government has said.  
 Chavez said in February that he was in talks with Casino to
offer the Saint-Etienne-based company a minority stake in the
food markets. He didn’t provide details on a possible venture
today.
