             Asian  stocks  rose, driving the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to its longest winning streak in 11 months,
as gold close to a record high boosted producers of the metal.  
 Newcrest Mining Ltd., Australia’s biggest gold producer,
gained 1.7 percent in Sydney and Zijin Mining Group Co., No. 1
in China, advanced 3.2 percent in Hong Kong. Softbank Corp., the
exclusive seller of Apple Inc.’s iPhone in Japan, climbed 2.7
percent as orders for a new model outstripped supply.  Toyota
Motor Corp. , which gets 28 percent of its sales in North America,
lost 1.7 percent in Tokyo after a report showed U.S. jobless
claims increased and the dollar weakened against the yen.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.3 percent to 116.22 as
of 7:14 p.m. in Tokyo, with about eight stocks advancing for
every seven that declined. The index has lost 3.5 percent this
year on concern that Greece and other European countries will
struggle to curb their budget deficits and repay debt. It rose
as much as 0.4 percent earlier today after a Spanish bond sale
yesterday boosted confidence.  
 “There was a lot of pessimism about what’s happening in
Europe that took the market down,” said  Tim Leung , who helps
manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“Stabilization in the European funding probably made a lot of
investors less worried about the situation.”  
 Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  was little changed at
9,995.02, the fifth week in a row it has closed below 10,000.
South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.2 percent and Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index gained 0.7 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index
retreated 1.8 percent.  
 MSCI Advance  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen for  seven consecutive
days , its longest winning streak since July. It has climbed 3.4
percent this week, on course for its biggest weekly increase
since the period ended Dec. 4. The index traded at its highest
level in four weeks today after swinging between a 0.1 percent
drop and a 0.4 percent climb.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  lost 0.1 percent.
The gauge was down most of the day yesterday in New York before
gains in the euro drove the index to close with a 0.1 percent
increase.  
 Newcrest rose 1.7 percent to A$35.24.  Lihir Gold Ltd. , the
second-largest gold producer on the Australian stock exchange,
gained 2.1 percent to A$4.35. Zijin Mining advanced 3.2 percent
to HK$5.87 in Hong Kong and Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. jumped
5.2 percent to HK$18.10, the highest level since March 2008.  
 IPhone Boost  
 Gold futures for delivery in August rose $18.20, or 1.5
percent, to $1,248.70 on the Comex in New York yesterday, the
biggest gain since June 7. Earlier, the metal reached $1,252.80.  
 Telecommunication-services companies  increased the most 
today among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index. Softbank, Japan’s third-biggest mobile-phone network, and
SK Broadband Co. of South Korea led the advance.  
 SK Broadband, a provider of Internet services, surged 5.2
percent to 6,090 won in Seoul, a one-month high. Korea
Investment & Securities Co. raised its recommendation on the
stock to “buy” from “hold” on the outlook for earnings.  
 Softbank climbed 2.7 percent to 2,488 yen and was the
 biggest contributor  to the Nikkei 225 after the company said
orders for the iPhone exceeded expectations. Nomura Holdings Inc.
boosted its share-price estimate to 3,320 yen from 3,180 yen.  
 Wintek Corp. , which makes parts for the iPhone, gained 2.4
percent to NT$25.40 in Taipei. Largan Precision Co., a maker of
camera modules for mobile phones, advanced 2.3 percent to NT$525.
They had the two biggest gains in the MSCI Taiwan Index.  
 ‘Key Demand Driver’  
 “We see the iPhone installed base rising from
approximately 30 million subscribers at the end of 2009 to over
100 million by the end of 2011,” Morgan Stanley analyst  Katy Huberty  said in a report dated June 16. “Upgrades will emerge
as a key demand driver in the coming years,” with demand for
the soon-to-be-released iPhone 4 helping to persuade more buyers
to embrace the smartphone, Morgan Stanley said.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has slumped 10 percent from its
high this year on April 15 as swelling budget deficits prompted
Standard & Poor’s to cut ratings of Greece, Spain and Portugal.
The retreat has driven down the average price of shares in the
gauge to 14.8 times  estimated earnings . The ratio sank to 13.8
times on May 18, the lowest level since December 2008.  
 A gauge of consumer-discretionary stocks, which include
carmakers, had the only decline among the 10 industry groups on
the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index . U.S. reports yesterday showed
claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly increased to the
highest level in a month, and manufacturing growth in the
Philadelphia Fed region slowed down.  
 Carmakers, Consumer Lenders  
 “The economic climate has to further improve in countries
like the U.S. for the stock market to enter a full-fledged
recovery phase,” said  Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at
Tokyo-based Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.  
 Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, sank 1.7 percent to
3,240 yen and was the heaviest single drag on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest automaker,
lost 1.7 percent to 2,690 yen.  Nissan Motor Co. , the third-
biggest, slid 2.5 percent to 671 yen.  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 90.75 per dollar from
91.29 at yesterday’s close of stock trading in Tokyo,
threatening to cut the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  
 Toyoda Gosei Co., a supplier of parts to Toyota, fell 0.4
percent to 2,410 yen after workers at a plant in the northern
Chinese city of Tianjin went on strike.  
 Acom Co., Japan’s largest consumer lender by market value,
fell 5.6 percent to 1,129 yen. A law taking effect today caps
interest rates at 20 percent and prohibits lending to borrowers
with consumer debt equal to a third or more of their annual
income.  
 Promise Co., the second-largest, plunged 6.1 percent to 648
yen. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Acom’s biggest
shareholder and Japan’s largest publicly traded bank, lost 1.4
percent to 420 yen.  
 “The number of consumer lenders could easily halve,” said
 Shiro Yoshioka , a Tokyo-based analyst at Japaninvest KK, an
independent research firm.
