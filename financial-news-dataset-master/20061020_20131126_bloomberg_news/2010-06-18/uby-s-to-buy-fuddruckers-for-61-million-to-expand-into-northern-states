             Luby’s Inc. , the owner of cafeteria-
style restaurants in the southern U.S., will buy insolvent
burger chain Fuddruckers for about $61 million in cash,
expanding into northern U.S. states.  
 Luby’s won the assets, which include Fuddruckers Inc.,
Magic Brands LLC and other affiliates, in an auction June 17,
according to a statement from the company today. The deal is
subject to bankruptcy court approval, Luby’s said.  
 The acquisition will help Luby’s, led by Chief Executive
Officer  Christopher Pappas , gain locations in states such as
Michigan, New York, New Jersey. Fuddruckers has 60 restaurants
throughout the U.S., and franchises run 138 more.  
 Luby’s plans to fund the deal with cash and by expanding
its credit facility. The Houston-based company will assume some
real estate leases and contracts as part of the deal. The
company had $7.7 million in cash and $18.4 million available
under its credit facility as of the end of the third quarter.  
 The company may have to pay an additional $2.45 million in
cash if it doesn’t assume certain contracts, Luby’s said.  
 Luby’s rose 47 cents, or 12 percent, to $4.30 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock was
halted before the announcement.
