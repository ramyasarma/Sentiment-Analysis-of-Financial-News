             France’s CAC 40 Index rose 4.13, or
0.1 percent, to 3,687.21 in Paris, climbing for an eighth day.
The broader SBF 120 Index also rose 0.1 percent.  
 The following is a list of companies whose shares either
rose or fell in the French capital. Stock symbols are in
parentheses after company names.  
 Credit Agricole SA  (ACA FP) rallied 6.1 percent to 9.88
euros amid speculation stress tests will show European banks are
robust.  Societe Generale SA  (GLE FP) gained 3 percent to 38.23
euros.  Dexia SA  (DEXB BB) increased 2.5 percent to 3.34 euros.  
 Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA scored the
second-highest rating among Europe’s largest banks in tests
carried out by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors,
according to El Economista. The newspaper cited a copy of the
test to which it had access.  
 Separately, Societe Generale’s Chief Executive Officer
Frederic Oudea said the results of a “stress test” on European
banks will “bring confidence to the market.”  
 Ipsen SA  (IPN FP) plunged 4.88 euros, or 15 percent, to
27.08 euros. Roche Holding AG delayed development of the
experimental diabetes drug taspoglutide by at least 12 to 18
months after more people than expected suffered from side
effects. Roche had planned to ask regulators to approve the
diabetes drug, which it licensed from Ipsen in 2006, next year.  
 Oddo & Cie lowered his recommendation for Ipsen to “add”
from “buy.” Analysts at Natixis, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank
of America-Merrill Lynch all cut their ratings on the shares to
“neutral.”  
 Saft Groupe SA (SAFT FP) rose 1.02 euros, or 3.8 percent,
to 27.94 euros, one of today’s biggest gains in Paris. The
company’s battery technology was selected for a pilot program by
the Sacramento municipal utility district in California.  
 Sanofi-Aventis SA  (SAN FP) retreated 1.54 euros, or 3
percent, to 49.57 amid renewed concern that the drugmaker’s
Lantus diabetes treatment may be linked to an increased risk of
cancer.  
 A study published this week in the journal Diabetes Care
tied insulin glargine, as Lantus also is known, to a higher
cancer risk, according to a note today from Hobart Capital
Markets, a London brokerage. The study is “unclear” and
“lacks precision,” Jean-Pierre Lehner, Sanofi’s chief medical
officer, said in a telephone interview. The study can be
“methodologically challenged,” the company said.
