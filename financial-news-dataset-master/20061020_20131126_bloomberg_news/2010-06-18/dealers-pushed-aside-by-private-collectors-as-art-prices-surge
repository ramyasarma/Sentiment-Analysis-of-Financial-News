             Private collectors have become more
powerful than dealers and museums in influencing the art market,
according to  Adam Lindemann , the man who in 2007 briefly made
 Jeff Koons  the world’s most expensive living artist.  
 “The value of art has changed forever. It’s never going to
go back,” the New York-based collector and writer said in an
interview at Art Basel in Switzerland. Lindemann is one of the
thousands of collectors visiting the world’s largest fair of
modern and contemporary works.  
 “The market has split. It’s bipolar,” said Lindemann.
“There’s no middle market money any more. There’s the
affordable stuff, and there’s a top tier of trophy works priced
at $1 million up. Anything in between is in no man’s land.”  
 “Power” collectors such as Don and Mera Rubell, Dakis
Joannou and  Francois Pinault  have changed the art market during
the last decade, Lindemann said. Wealthy individuals are holding
shows of emerging artists before they are discovered by dealers,
striking fear into the exhibition programs of cash-strapped
museums, he said.  
 “The private foundations have taken on such momentum that
the museums are afraid of them,” said Lindemann, 48, wearing an
open-necked shirt, blazer and cream slacks.  
 He gave the example of the U.S. artist Matthew Day Jackson,
recently exhibited at Pinault’s Punta della Dogana museum in
Venice. In February, the artist’s 2007 oval canvas “Bucky”
sold for a record 601,250 pounds ($891,293) at a Christie’s
International auction in London. Jackson has just been signed by
the Zurich, London and New York-based dealers Hauser & Wirth,
who sold a new wood sculpture by the artist on the first day of
Art Basel priced at $150,000.  
 Koons Profit  
 Lindemann himself was an influence on the market when he
sold the Koons sculpture “Hanging Heart (Magenta/ Gold)” at
 Sotheby’s  in New York for $23.6 million with fees, the most paid
for a work by a living artist at that time. He was reported to
have bought the sculpture from the  Gagosian Gallery  for $4
million in 2005.  
 Koons was overtaken as the most expensive living artist in
2008 when  Lucian Freud’s  1995 painting, “Benefits Supervisor
Sleeping,” fetched $33.6 million at Christie’s International.  
 “I don’t talk about what I sell,” Lindemann said. “What
I would say is that I’ve never sold anything I didn’t wish I 
still had.”  
 The son of cell-phone billionaire entrepreneur  George Lindemann , who developed the soft contact lens, Lindemann worked
on Wall Street after Yale Law School. He later started his own
investment firm.  
 He began collecting contemporary art in the early 1980s and
acquired works by  Julian Schnabel ,  Andy Warhol ,  Jean-Michel Basquiat , Koons,  Urs Fischer ,  Takashi Murakami  and  Damien Hirst .
He is married to the gallerist Amalia Dayan, granddaughter of
the Israeli general  Moshe Dayan .  
 Bigger, Better  
 “I’m more risk-averse these days,” said Lindemann. “I
feel safer with more established contemporary artists. I’m
looking to buy better works, bigger works.” He declined to
mention any specific purchases.  
 The market for contemporary art became more conservative
after a crisis that in 2009 reduced the prices of some
fashionable names by more than 50 percent, he said.  
 “Sadly there’s less bandwidth for new artists to emerge,”
said Lindemann. “A lot of galleries got stuffed. They’re
struggling to maintain their programs.”  
 Rising prices for established artists also reduced
opportunities for museums to acquire the works to boost visitor
numbers. Rather than donate valuable pieces to public
institutions, many collectors will create their own museums,
like the  Beyeler Foundation  in Basel, currently showing a
Basquiat exhibition. One of its star works -- the 1982 painting
“Untitled (Devil)” -- is owned by Lindemann.  
 “There’s room for a lot more private museums,” he said.
“Perhaps one day, if I’m lucky enough to have the right works,
I might even have my own ‘Beyeler.”  
 Art Basel’s main sponsor is  UBS AG . The event takes place
at Messe Basel, Messeplatz, 4005 Basel.
