             Structured note issuers have sold a
range of equity-linked securities tied to the World Cup soccer
tournament in South Africa with returns based on what team will
win to how much beer is sold during the competition.  
 Spanish lender  Banco de Sabadell SA  issued securities in
April tied to the EuroStoxx 50 index of companies that pays a 7
percent bonus on half the initial investment if Spain wins the
cup, according to the prospectus. The three-year notes guarantee
investors will be repaid in full. Spain, one of the favorites to
win, lost their first game against Switzerland on June 16.  
 Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Germany issued two-year
index-linked securities that pay a one-time bonus of 2 percent
if Germany wins. Germany is currently fifth-favorite to win,
according to betting exchange Betfair Ltd.  
 Societe Generale SA’s SG Football 2010 two-year note, which
tracks a basket of 16 companies including brewers Heineken NV
and Carlsberg A/S as well as retailers Tesco Plc and Hennes &
Mauritz AB, has risen 1.7 percent since June 11, according to
SocGen prices on Bloomberg. That compares with a 2.8 percent
gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index in the same period.  
 BNP Paribas SA issued securities based on a basket of 13
stocks tied to consumer spending and a fund that tracks South
African companies. The notes due in December 2011 returned 1.8
percent since June 11, though have gained 11.5 percent since
they were issued in February.
