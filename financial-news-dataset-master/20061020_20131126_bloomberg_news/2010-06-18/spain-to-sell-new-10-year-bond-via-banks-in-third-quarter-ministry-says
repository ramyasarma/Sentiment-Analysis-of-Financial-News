             Spain said it will sell a new 10-
year note through banks in the third quarter, a day after
garnering increased demand at a debt auction.  
 The government, which is grappling with the third-largest
deficit in the euro region, will also sell bonds maturing in
2013, 2015, 2025 and 2041 at auctions in the next three months,
the Finance Ministry said in a statement.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish
debt over benchmark German bunds of the same maturity fell 11
basis points to 199 basis points today. Spain, which faces 24.7
billion euros of maturing debt in July, had seen the risk
premium on its debt soar amid concerns over the solvency of its
banks amid a two-year economic slump.  
 “Spain is now sufficiently confident with its issuance
schedule that it’s pushing ahead with the syndication,” said
Ciaran O’Hagan, a fixed-income strategist at Societe Generale
SA. The deal will be for a “few billion” euros, he said.  
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of bonds
yesterday, the maximum set for the auction, prompting a rally in
the euro and regional equity markets. Investors bid for 2.45
times the amount of 30-year debt on offer, higher than the 1.38
at the previous sale on March 18.  
 The nation’s yield premium over bunds surged to 211 basis
points on June 16, the highest since before the start of the
euro, from 160 basis points at the end of May amid speculation
that Spain would need to tap the European Union for a financial
lifeline.
