             China Sci-Tech Holdings Ltd .,
raising $1 billion to buy two copper projects, surged to a
16-month high in Hong Kong after three investors pledged to
buy more than a third of the new stock.  
 China Sci-Tech  gained  as much as 20 percent, the most
since April 27, and were up 17.3 percent, or 7 cents, to 47.5
Hong Kong cents before being suspended pending a “possible
launch of the placing,” it said in a statement to the Hong
Kong stock exchange today.  
 The Hong Kong-based company, changing its business from
property and securities investment, is acquiring mines in
Peru and Australia, betting on growing metal demand from
emerging markets including China. It plans to produce about
250,000 metric tons of copper annually within three to five
years.  
 The share sale’s three cornerstone investors -- CCBI
International Asset Management Ltd., the investment arm of
China Construction Bank Corp., Chow Tai Fook Nominee Ltd. and
Bondic International Holdings Ltd. -- will buy $370 million
worth of China Sci-Tech stock, it said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 China Sci-Tech’s chairman,  Chiu Tao , will subscribe to
$100 million worth of shares, it said. China Sci-Tech is
selling the stock at 20 Hong Kong cents apiece.  
 The company will spend about $260 million to purchase
Chariot Resources Ltd., giving it control of the Mina Justa
project in Peru, and about $130 million on the Lady Annie
copper mine in Australia, according to slides presented by
the company in May.
