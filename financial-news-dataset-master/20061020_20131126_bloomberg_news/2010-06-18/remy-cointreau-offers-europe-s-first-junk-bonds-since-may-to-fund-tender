             Remy Cointreau SA , the maker of Remy
Martin cognac and Bols liqueur, said it plans to sell new high-
yield bonds to fund a tender offer for outstanding notes.  
 The sale of at least 200 million euros ($250 million) of
bonds due 2016 by the Paris-based liquor firm is the first by a
European company rated below Baa3 at Moody’s Investors Service
and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s in more than a month. Brake-pad
maker TMD Friction Holding GmbH raised 160 million euros on May
14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Remy Cointreau is offering holders of its 2012 notes 1,015
euros per 1,000-euro note, according to a statement. It has 192
million euros of 5.2 percent bonds that mature in January 2012,
as well as a revolving credit line that matures in June 2012,
Bloomberg data show. The offer closes June 25.  
 Corporate debt issuance in Europe has stalled amid investor
concern austerity measures to ease the euro-area’s sovereign
debt crisis will curb growth and hurt corporate earnings. High-
yield bond issuance dropped 85 percent in May to $1.3 billion
compared with the previous month, Bloomberg data show.  
 Remy Cointreau is  rated  Ba2, two steps below investment
grade, by Moody’s, and a level lower at BB- by S&P. The company
hired Credit Suisse Group AG and Credit Agricole CIB to organize
investor presentations in Paris earlier this week and the two
banks are managing the tender offer, according to the statement.
