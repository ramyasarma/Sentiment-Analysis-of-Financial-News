             Brazilian pension funds  Previ  and
 Petros  and BNDES Participacoes SA plan to sell their stakes at
 Paranapanema SA , Valor Economico reported, without saying where
it obtained the information.  
 Previ, the pension fund for Banco do Brasil SA employees,
has a 24 percent stake in the company and Petros, the pension
fund for workers at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, has 12 percent, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper reported.  BNDESPar  has 17 percent of
Paranapanema, Valor said.  
 The shareholders hired Banco Itau BBA SA to seek a buyer
for the stake, Valor said, citing an unidentified person from
one of the pension funds.  
 Previ and Petros didn’t immediately return Bloomberg News
calls seeking for comments. A BNDESPar spokeswoman said the
company can’t comment on plans to sell or buy shares of public
traded companies.
