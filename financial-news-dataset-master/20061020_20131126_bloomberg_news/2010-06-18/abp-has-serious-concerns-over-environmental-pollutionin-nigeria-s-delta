             Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP has
“serious concerns” over reports about environmental pollution
in Nigeria’s Niger River Delta as a result of crude spills and
flaring, the Dutch pension fund said in a statement on its Web
site.  
 “As an involved Royal Dutch Shell Plc shareholder, we
continue to press for attention for the problems in Nigeria," ABP
said.
