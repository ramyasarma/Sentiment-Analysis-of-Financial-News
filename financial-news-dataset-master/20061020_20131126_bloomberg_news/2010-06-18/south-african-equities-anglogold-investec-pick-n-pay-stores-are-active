             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  slid 37.33, or 0.1 percent, to 27,761.70. The
measure rose 3.4 percent in the week, a second weekly increase.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that accounts for more than 10 percent of the benchmark, dropped
3.95 rand, or 1.3 percent, to 296.83 rand. Copper fell in New
York and London, heading for a weekly decline, after reports
stoked concern that the economic rebound may be weaker than
expected in the U.S., the world’s second-largest consumer of the
metal.  
 FirstRand Ltd.  (FSR SJ), South Africa’s second-biggest
banking group, lost 72 cents, or 3.7 percent, to 18.95 rand, the
biggest decline in a month.  Absa Group Ltd. , South Africa’s
largest retail bank, dropped 2.50 rand, or 2 percent, to 124.99
rand.  
 German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said that all 27 European
Union members agreed to bank stress tests, with the results to
be published “at the latest the second half of July.”  
 Naspers Ltd.  (NPN SJ), Africa’s biggest media company,
increased 7.75 rand, or 2.9 percent, to 280 rand, the biggest
gain since May 26. Core headline earnings, which the company
regards as its best performance measure, will increase by
between 15 and 25 percent from 11.79 rand a year earlier,
Naspers said. A median forecast by 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg put adjusted earnings at 14.20 rand. The sale of its
Greek pay-television unit caused a once-off accounting profit a
year earlier.  
 Pick n Pay Stores Ltd.  (PIK SJ), South Africa’s second-
largest food retailer, rose 94 cents, or 2.1 percent, to 45
rand, the biggest gain in three weeks. The company plans to open
more than 50 express stores at BP Plc gas stations in South
Africa over the next two years,  Nick Badminton , the company’s
chief executive officer, said at an annual general meeting in
Cape Town today.
