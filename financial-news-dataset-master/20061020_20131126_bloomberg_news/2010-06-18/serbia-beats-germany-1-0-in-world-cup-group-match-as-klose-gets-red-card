             Serbia upset Germany 1-0 in a World
Cup Group D game. Germany’s  Miroslav Klose  was red-carded in the
first half and teammate  Lukas Podolski  had a penalty kick saved.  
 Milan Jovanovic scored after 38 minutes in Port Elizabeth,
South Africa, immediately after Klose was ejected for a second
yellow-card offense. Serbia goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic then
stopped Podolski’s penalty in the 60th minute.  
 It was Germany’s first defeat in a World Cup group game
since 1986. It remains atop the group because of a superior goal
difference after beating Australia 4-0 in its first game.  
 Serbia and Ghana, which plays Australia tomorrow, are tied
for second with three points. The top two teams after three
rounds of games advance.  
 “It was a very important game for us,” Stojkovic told
reporters. “Everybody believed in this win.”  
 Klose was ejected after tripping Serbia captain  Dejan Stankovic , the German’s second yellow card and one of nine
handed out in the match. A minute later, Jovanovic scored from
eight yards out, then jumped over advertising boards to
celebrate with some compatriots.  
 Germany’s  Sami Khedira  smashed a shot against the crossbar
in the last minute of the first half. Stojkovic dived to his
left to save Podolski’s penalty in the 60th minute after a
handball against  Nemanja Vidic . Jovanovic and  Milos Krasic  then
hit the post and the crossbar with shots.  
 “In the second half we played a lot better with a man
down,” Germany coach  Joachim Loew  told reporters.
