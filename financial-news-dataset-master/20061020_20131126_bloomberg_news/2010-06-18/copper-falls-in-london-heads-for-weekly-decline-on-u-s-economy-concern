             Copper fell in New York and London,
heading for a weekly decline, after reports stoked concern that
the economic rebound may be weaker than expected in the U.S.,
the world’s second-largest consumer of the metal.  
 Manufacturing in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank’s
region expanded in June at the slowest pace since August, and
initial jobless claims rose in the week ended June 12, data
showed yesterday. U.S. housing starts fell the most since March
2009 and building permits, a sign of future construction, slid
to a one-year low, reports showed on June 16.  
 “The U.S. data was not great,” said  Jesper Dannesboe , a
strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. Still, “we expect
the U.S. recovery to continue, helped by super-lax monetary
policy and pent-up demand,” he said.  
 Futures for September delivery declined 4 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.884 a pound at 8:12 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The most-active contract retreated to the lowest intraday
price since June 10 and is down 1.4 percent this week. Copper
for delivery in three months dropped 1.5 percent to $6,350.25 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  
 LME copper has slid 14 percent this year on concern about
European nations’ ability to reduce budget deficits and steps
taken by China, the biggest copper user, to cool its real-estate
market. Governments in countries from Greece to Portugal are
slashing wages for state employees and increasing taxes in an
effort to rein in borrowing.  
 ‘Overdone’ China Concern  
 “European governments are about to tighten fiscal
policies, and the market is worried about the impact on the
global economy,” Dannesboe said. Concern about the possibility
of “a sharp economic slowdown” in China stemming from
government policy measures is “vastly overdone,” he said.  
 China should make more use of the exchange rate and
interest rates to help manage its economy and reduce risks from
surging housing prices and overinvestment, the World Bank said
today in a quarterly report on the nation’s economy.  
 Still, UniCredit SpA expects “some weakening” in China
linked to the government measures, analyst  Jochen Hitzfeld  in
Munich said by phone. “Copper prices will stay around $6,400”
a ton in the year’s second half, he said.  
 LME copper has slid 4.9 percent since June 15, erasing a
3.1 percent gain in this week’s first two days, as the U.S.
housing-start and building-permit figures weighed on prices.
Construction accounts for a quarter of copper demand, according
to the  Copper Development Association .  
 Nickel, Tin  
 Nickel for three-month delivery on the LME fell 2.2 percent
to $19,375 a ton. World production exceeded demand in April,
2010’s first surplus, according to the International Nickel
Study Group. Demand was 116,900 tons against primary-metal
output of 119,500 tons, it said in a report yesterday.  
 Aluminum slipped 0.2 percent to $1,962 a ton and zinc
dropped 1.4 percent to $1,740 a ton. Lead shed 1.7 percent to
$1,733.50 a ton and tin fell 1.1 percent to $17,550 a ton.  
 Stockpiles of copper tracked by the LME fell 0.6 percent to
457,425 tons, the lowest since Dec. 8. Inventories monitored by
the Shanghai Futures Exchange shrank for a seventh week to the
lowest level in more than three months. They fell 2.4 percent to
135,944 tons, the exchange said in a statement today.  
 Bookings to remove metal from LME warehouses declined 3.5
percent to 27,400 tons.  
 LME-monitored aluminum inventories fell for a third day to
4.47 million tons. One party held between 30 percent and 39
percent of available inventories as of June 16, according to the
latest data from the bourse. That’s down from 40 percent and 49
percent in the previous session and between 50 percent and 79
percent on June 14.
