             America's Cup challenger Team New Zealand cadged everything from timber to electrical fittings to build its training base in  Valencia ,  Spain . Defending-champion Alinghi had no such problem: it had enough cash for a basketball court and roof terrace.    ``Financially, it's David against Goliath,'' Grant Dalton,  Team New Zealand's  managing director, said as the teams prepared to vie for sailing's most-prestigious prize in a rematch of their 2003 contest in Auckland.    More than a silver trophy is at stake in the best-of-nine regatta that starts June 23. Because of the financial gulf between the two teams, the result may determine the future of the 156-year-old America's Cup. The winner earns the right to make the rules for the next edition.    While Team  New Zealand  plans to preserve tradition and hold the next event in four years time, Ernesto Bertarelli's Alinghi wants it to be in 2009 to help maintain the surge in sponsorship revenue that accompanied the first race in  Europe  since 1851. Alinghi would also schedule a series of warm-up races in Europe and possibly the  Middle East .    ``The America's Cup is in the modern world,'' says Michel Bonnefous, chief executive officer of  Alinghi 's America's Cup management organization. ``It's good for the America's Cup to have companies supporting this event. They make the event live, they make people come.''    Bertarelli, the 41-year-old Swiss billionaire, has overseen an economic boom in the America's Cup since Alinghi ended the Kiwi team's eight-year dominance in 2003.    Formula One    Borrowing ideas from Formula One motor racing, which grosses $1 billion a year, the organizing committee pushed revenue to 230 million euros ($306 million), a 10-fold increase from four years ago, Bonnefous said. Valencia paid 90 million euros to host the event, the first time a city has paid for the honor.    Organizers also signed up new sponsors, including Spain's  Banco Santander (SAN)  Central Hispano SA, Spain's biggest bank, and Paris-based  Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) , the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment. Most of the revenue went back into improving TV coverage and promoting the America's Cup with warm-up regattas from Malmo,  Sweden , to Sicily, Bonnefous says.    Team New Zealand says smaller teams can't afford to hold the event more frequently, which would increase costs and reduce preparation time.    ``A two-year cycle works if you're a big, powerful team because the machine rolls on,'' says Kevin Shoebridge, the team's director of sailing and operations. ``But there's no way we could have been ready in less than three years.''    Commodore Stevens    The first America's Cup took place in 1851, when John Cox Stevens, commodore of the  New York Yacht Club , challenged U.K. skippers to a race off the Isle of Wight. Cox's boat, America, won and his club defended the trophy for 132 years until an Australian challenger snapped the streak. Alinghi was the first European winner.    The contest, whose fans have included former U.S. President  John F. Kennedy , attracted sponsorship from  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  and Prada Holdings NV beginning in the 1980s as the luxury-goods makers sought wealthy fans.    Yacht racing remained a rich-man's hobby until the 1990s, says Grant Simmer, Alinghi's managing director.    As a navigator on the Australian team in 1983, Simmer says he earned $15 a day and slept in a bunk bed in a girls' school dormitory in Newport,  Rhode Island . Now he has a four-year contract and a rented apartment in Valencia.    ``The game has changed,'' says  Tom Cannon , the dean of business at the U.K.'s Buckingham University, who in May published a study of the economic benefits of hosting the America's Cup. ``It might be nice to go back to the good old days in Newport, but it's hard to turn the clock back.''    Protecting Roots    Traditionalists say that putting more focus on economic interests may mean that the competition loses its roots and smaller teams will have to drop out.    ``We must not change the true nature of the America's Cup by changing it into a racing circuit -- that would take away its charm,'' said Patrizio Bertelli, CEO of Prada, which controls unsuccessful challenger Luna Rossa. ``If the America's Cup is every two years, we will weigh our participation.''    While advocating a four-year race cycle, Team New Zealand backs Alinghi's idea of holding warm-up regattas in different countries and would consider having them in Europe if it were to win this year's America's Cup.    ``They've taken it to a far wider audience,'' Shoebridge said. ``The cup has now got serious presence in Europe and it would be a shame to lose that.''    Such races may give Europe-based sponsors a reason to keep bankrolling teams, even if the next America's Cup is in New Zealand, said Bjoern Widemann, group marketing director at  Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe's biggest insurer and the main sponsor of the BMW-Oracle team, which failed to qualify for the final.    Still, the time difference would mean that races in New Zealand would be televised in the middle of the night in Europe, diluting sponsors' exposure, Widemann said.    ``That's not our concern,'' Shoebridge said. ``If we win it, we'd like nothing more than to take it back to New Zealand.''
