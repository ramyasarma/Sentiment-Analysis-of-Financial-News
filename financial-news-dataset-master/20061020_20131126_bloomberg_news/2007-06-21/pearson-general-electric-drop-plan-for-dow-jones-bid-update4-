             Pearson Plc (PSON)  and  General Electric Co. (GE) 
abandoned a possible bid for Dow Jones & Co., increasing  Rupert Murdoch 's chance of succeeding with his $5 billion offer for the
publisher of the Wall Street Journal.  
 GE, owner of the CNBC cable-TV channel, and London-based
Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, said in separate
statements that they held preliminary talks on combining those
operations with New York-based Dow Jones.  
 The decision eliminates one potential way for the
controlling Bancroft family to sell Dow Jones without turning it
over to Murdoch's  News Corp. (NWSA)  The Bancrofts have been reluctant
to accept Murdoch's $60 a share bid out of concern for editorial
independence. Yesterday, Dow Jones's  board  took over
negotiations with Murdoch, a move that may accelerate a sale.  
 ``Rupert, all along, has been the logical and only buyer
for these assets, and the Bancrofts at this point would be well
advised to entertain the offer,'' said Lawrence J. Haverty Jr.,
associate portfolio manager at Gamco Investors Inc. in Rye, New
York, owner of 884,650 Dow Jones shares as of March. ``No one
will pay more.''  
 News Corp. spokesman  Andrew Butcher , and Dow Jones
spokeswoman Andrea Grinbaum and Bancroft family representative
Roy Winnick all declined to comment.  
 Murdoch's bid was 65 percent more than Dow Jones's market
value before the offer was made public on May 1. Without
competition from GE and Pearson, Murdoch may not have to
increase it, said Joe Bonner, an analyst with Argus Research in
New York who rates News Corp. shares ``buy.''  
 Back to Level  
 Shares of Dow Jones, which closed as high as $61.20 on June
1, an indication that higher, competing bids were a possibility,
have settled back to the offer price. They dropped 94 cents to
$59.71 at 4:02 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading. Class A  shares  of New York-based News Corp. fell 2
cents to $22.08, and General Electric, based in Fairfield,
 Connecticut , rose 1 cent to $38.80. Pearson declined by 7.5
pence to 824.5 pence in  London .  
 ``He's played it about as well as he could,'' Bonner said.
``I see no reason why he needs to raise his bid now.''  
 Negotiations with News Corp., owner more than 110
newspapers in  Australia , the U.K. and the U.S., including the
New York Post, stalled while the Bancrofts put together a
proposal to guarantee editorial independence under Murdoch.  
 At a Dow Jones board meeting yesterday, family
representatives presented a proposal to create a special
committee that would protect Journal editors and reporters from
outside pressure.  
 Opposition to Murdoch  
 The Dow Jones Foundation and certain family trusts would
have responsibility for the oversight and enforcement of the
agreement, Winnick said.  
 Murdoch's bid is opposed by the Wall Street Journal's
employees' union and by James Ottaway Jr., whose family controls
6.2 percent of the  voting rights  at Dow Jones. Ottaway said GE
and Pearson would be better owners for the Wall Street Journal
than News Corp.  
 Also yesterday, MySpace.com founder Brad Greenspan offered
$60 a share for 25 percent of Dow Jones, matching Murdoch's
price. The offer is a ``wild card,'' said  Ken Doctor , an analyst
at Outsell Inc., a media researcher in Burlingame,  California .  
 Greenspan opposed the 2005 sale of MySpace parent Intermix
Media Inc. to News Corp. and made a competing bid that was
rejected by Intermix's board. He had earlier been ousted as the
company's chief executive officer.  
 Faded Vision  
 GE and Pearson had envisioned giving the Bancrofts a
minority stake in a venture that included CNBC and the Financial
Times, a person with knowledge of the talks said this week. The
companies said today they continue to discuss ways for CNBC and
the Financial Times to work together.  
 ``The combination of a complicated structure and a very
high-priced deal makes it not surprising that GE and Pearson
won't pursue a deal with Dow Jones,'' said Robert Broadwater,
managing director of Broadwater & Associates, a media investment
firm. ``Ultimately, it goes back to price, and $60 a share is a
steep hill to climb.''
