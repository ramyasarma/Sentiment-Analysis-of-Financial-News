             Russian stocks fell by the biggest
percentage this month, dragging the  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  down from a
seven-week high, on renewed concern that global interest rates
will rise.  
 OAO Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank, and OAO Unified Energy
System, the country's electricity holding company, paced the
retreat.  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  fell after Deutsche Bank AG recommended
selling shares in the nation's largest publicly traded company.  
 The ruble-denominated Micex lost 1.6 percent to 1673.59. The
index closed yesterday at the highest since April 26. All but one
stock declined today. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  decreased
1.2 percent to 1893.22.  
 Standard & Poor's 500 Index declined in early U.S. trading
today. The gauge lost the most in two weeks yesterday as bond
yields, which influence rates on mortgages and corporate loans,
increased.  
 ``All  Russia  has done is fall down on sympathy with the
U.S.,'' said Julian Rimmer, head of sales trading at UralSib
Financial Corp. in  London . ``Russia has had a big run. There's a
little profit taking.''  
 The Micex has climbed 9.9 percent since May 30, compared
with a 6.4 percent gain for Morgan Stanley Capital
International's Emerging Market Index, a global benchmark.  
 Sberbank lost 1.4 percent to 99,455 rubles. Unified Energy
fell 2 percent to 34.613 rubles. OAO Surgutneftegaz, the
country's fourth-biggest oil producer, slid 2.6 percent to 29.291
rubles. The stock has lost 27 percent this year.  
 ``The sell-off in U.S. equities on concern about rising bond
yields creates a negative backdrop,''  Chris Weafer , chief
strategist at Alfa Bank in Moscow, wrote in a research note
today.  
 Gazprom  
 Gazprom fell 1.8 percent to 263.14 rubles on the Micex Stock
Exchange, its worst decline in June. Deutsche Bank's Moscow
brokerage unit cut its recommendation on the shares to ``sell''
from ``hold,'' saying the stock had recently risen above its
price estimate of $9 (234 rubles). The bank also warned about the
risk that the Russian government may raise the tax on gas
production.  
 Deutsche Bank also cut its recommendation on OAO Tatneft,
the oil producer in Russia's Tatarstan republic, to ``sell'' from
``hold.'' Tatneft shares dropped 1.5 percent to 123.31 rubles.  
 Lebedyansky, Aeroflot  
 Shares of OAO Lebedyansky, Russia's biggest juice maker,
climbed 0.7 percent to 2,205.08 rubles. Bank of Moscow, the bank
partly owned by the Moscow city government, raised its
recommendation on the stock to ``buy'' from ``hold,'' citing
Lebedyansky's projected growth in juice and mineral water sales.
The bank raised its price estimate on the shares 6.2 percent to
$100.83 (2,617 rubles).  
 Moscow-based Lebedyansky said that revenue in the first
quarter climbed 38 percent to $183.2 million.  
 OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia's biggest cellular telephone
company, climbed 0.3 percent to $59.70 in New York. Credit Suisse
Group raised its price estimate on the shares 7.4 percent to $64,
saying Russian cellular companies were ``significantly
undervalued.''  
 OAO Aeroflot (AFLT) , the No. 1 airline in eastern Europe, sank 1.4
percent to 71.68 rubles. Deputy Chief Executive Officer Lev
Koshlyakov said the Russian government's involvement in the
airline was ``very important'' and that it isn't ready for
complete privatization.
