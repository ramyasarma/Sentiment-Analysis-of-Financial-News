North Korea may have three or four
more plants for enriching uranium for nuclear use, including one
in Pyongyang, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported, citing a South
Korean intelligence official it didn’t identify. The U.S. and
South Korea suspect North Korea of enriching uranium at
locations other than a Yongbyon plant the country revealed to
U.S. scientists last month, the Korean-language newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
