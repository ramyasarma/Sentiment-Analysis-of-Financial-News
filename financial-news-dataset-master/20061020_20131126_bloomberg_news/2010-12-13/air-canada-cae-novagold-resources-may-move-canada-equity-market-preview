     Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  rose for a third
day, led by oil and metal producers, as China refrained from
boosting interest rates after reporting higher inflation than
most economists forecast.  Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
advanced 1.2 percent as crude oil climbed the most in eight
days. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer of the
metal, gained 0.9 percent after China’s statistics bureau said
consumer prices increased 5.1 percent in November from a year
earlier. Precious-metals reseller Gold Wheaton Gold Corp. jumped
14 percent after agreeing to be purchased by Franco-Nevada Corp.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 56.39
points, or 0.4 percent, to a 15-month high of 13,295.86.  “We got the relief that there was no China rate hike over
the weekend -- which was rumored -- even with inflation being a
little higher than people thought it was going to be,” said
 Greg Taylor , who helps oversee C$5 billion ($4.98 billion) as a
money manager at Aurion Capital Management in Toronto. “We have
a little of a window to year-end with no Chinese rate hikes.
That’s got the commodities going.”  The index rallied 13 percent this year through Dec. 10, led
by a 34 percent surge in shares of raw-materials companies.
Copper gained 22 percent and oil 11 percent as  industrial
production  in China increased 16 percent over last year through
November 30.  Firms including UBS AG and Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. had
forecast the People’s Bank of China would raise interest rates
over the weekend for the second time in two months. The central
bank did extend a temporary 0.5-percentage-point increase in
banks’ reserve requirements, two people briefed on the matter
said today.  Energy Shares  Thirty-nine of 55  S&P/TSX energy companies  gained after a
Chinese report said refineries in the country ran at record
rates last month. Crude oil for January delivery advanced 0.9
percent to $88.61 a barrel.  Suncor increased 1.2 percent to C$36.63. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., the country’s second-largest energy company by
market value, rose 2.4 percent to C$43.26 after  Michael P. Dunn ,
an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp., boosted his 12-month
share-price estimate on the stock to C$50 from C$46. Oil-sands
developer BlackPearl Resources Inc. gained 7.1 percent to a
four-year high of C$6.  Gold futures gained 0.9 percent and silver 3.6 percent in
New York as the  U.S. dollar  fell for the first time in six days
against a basket of world currencies.  Mining Shares  Barrick advanced 0.9 percent to C$54.32. Silver reseller
Silver Wheaton Corp. climbed 2 percent to C$39.65.  Gold Wheaton, spun off from FNX Mining Co. in 2008 to
resell the precious-metal byproducts of FNX’s base-metals
mining, soared 14 percent to C$4.99 after agreeing to be bought
by Franco-Nevada Corp. for shares and cash. Gold Wheaton, which
touched a 25-month high, valued the deal at C$830 million, or
$5.20 a share.  Franco-Nevada, which owns gold, oil and gas royalties in
North America, lost 3.8 percent to C$32.15. Quadra FNX Mining
Ltd., the result of a May merger between FNX and Quadra Mining
Ltd., rallied 5.9 percent to C$16.04 after agreeing to sell its
 35 percent  stake in Gold Wheaton for C$262.6 million.  Fronteer Gold Inc., which explores for gold in Nevada,
jumped 7.3 percent to a three-year high of C$11.45 after
reporting what it called “robust” drilling results.  Semafo Inc., which mines gold in Africa, sank 4.6 percent
to C$11.75 to extend its five-day decline to 17 percent. The
shares had tripled in a year before  Dan Rollins , an analyst at
UBS, began coverage of the company with a “neutral” rating,
saying the company’s valuation might deter a potential takeover
bid.  Cameco Corp., the world’s second-largest uranium producer,
advanced 1.3 percent to C$39.15, extending a 16-month high. The
volume of the nuclear fuel sold in the spot market this year hit
a record last week due to demand from Asia, TradeTech LLC said.  Insurers Climb  Sun Life Financial Inc., Canada’s third-biggest insurer,
climbed 2.2 percent to C$30.18. An  index of S&P/TSX insurers  has
gained nine straight days, the longest streak since 2003, as
bond yields have risen. Bank of Nova Scotia, the country’s
third-largest bank, increased 1 percent to a record C$56.56 as
the six biggest lenders rallied.  BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. dropped 2.3
percent to C$61.25 after  Alexander Peterc , an analyst at Exane
BNP Paribas, cut his rating on the stock to “neutral” from
“outperform.” In a note to clients, Peterc cut his earnings
estimate for the fourth quarter, citing a potential lack of new
models before the release of the PlayBook tablet next year.  To contact the reporters on this story;
