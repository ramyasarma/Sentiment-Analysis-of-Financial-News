Treasuries rose, erasing their drop,
as less U.S. debt was submitted to the Federal Reserve in its
buyback today.  “People were taken aback that the securities offered in
the buybacks was only $18 billion, way down from $30 billion,”
said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading at Bank of Nova
Scotia in New York. “It’s just less securities being offered,
meaning people’s positions have been pared down.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
