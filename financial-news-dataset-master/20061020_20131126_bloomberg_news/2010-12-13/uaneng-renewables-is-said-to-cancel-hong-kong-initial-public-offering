Huaneng Renewables Corp. has
cancelled its initial public offering in Hong Kong because the
company didn’t want to price its shares at the bottom of a range
offered to investors, two people with knowledge of the
transaction said.   The renewable-energy unit of China’s biggest electricity
producer received enough orders to price the 2.5 billion shares
in its IPO at HK$2.98, said the people, who declined to be
identified before an announcement. The stock had initially been
offered at HK$2.98 to HK$3.98 each. Huaneng Renewables had until
Dec. 14 to price its shares before the initial offering lapsed,
according to the company’s IPO prospectus.  Wang Hongmei, the director of China Huaneng Group’s news
office in Beijing, did not immediately answer telephone calls
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
