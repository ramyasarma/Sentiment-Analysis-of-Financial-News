South Africa’s National Treasury
today released proposals on how to phase in a  tax on carbon
emissions  to encourage businesses to use green energy.  The ministry proposed directly taxing either carbon
emissions, fossil fuel inputs, or products generated with the
use of fossil fuels as an energy source, the Pretoria-based
Treasury said in an e-mailed statement.  “A carbon tax imposed directly on all measured emissions
of carbon dioxide appears to be the most appropriate,” the
Treasury said.  South Africa, the continent’s largest economy, last year
committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 34 percent by
2020 and 42 percent by 2025 below the “business as usual
scenario,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
