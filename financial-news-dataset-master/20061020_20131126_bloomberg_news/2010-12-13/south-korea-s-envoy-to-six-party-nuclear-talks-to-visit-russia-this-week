South Korea’s chief envoy to
multilateral talks on North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs
will visit Russia this week to discuss the tensions prompted by
the North’s artillery attack last month.  Wi Sung Lac ’s trip comes as North Korean Foreign Minister
 Pak Ui Chun  also visits Russia. Wi is scheduled to meet his
Russian counterparts on Dec. 15, a foreign ministry official in
Seoul said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  North Korea’s Nov. 23 deadly shelling of a South Korean
island in disputed waters was followed by separate U.S. military
drills with the South and Japan. China has resisted U.S.
pressure to use its influence as the North’s only ally to push
 Kim Jong Il ’s regime to change its behavior. Kim met Chinese
State Councilor  Dai Bingguo  on Dec. 9 in Pyongyang and “reached
important consensus,” China’s Foreign Ministry said on its
website.  China’s proposal for “emergency” talks with countries
involved in North Korea disarmament negotiations has been
rejected by South Korea, Japan and the U.S. Russia, which also
takes part in the six-party talks, hasn’t taken a position. The
forum last met in December 2008.  In the meeting with Dai, Kim expressed willingness to
accept China’s suggestion for dialogue,  Yonhap News  reported
late yesterday, citing South Korean diplomats it didn’t
identify. Chinese Foreign Minister  Yang Jiechi  said his country
is “working hard” to ease tensions in the region, the China
Daily reported today, citing a Dec. 10 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
