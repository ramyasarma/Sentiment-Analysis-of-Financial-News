U.S. stocks pared gains as consumer
shares such as J.C. Penney Co., Urban Outfitters Inc. and New
York Times Co. dropped, offsetting a rally triggered by China’s
decision not to raise interest rates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent to
1,243.36 at 3:38 p.m. New York time after rising as much as 0.5
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
