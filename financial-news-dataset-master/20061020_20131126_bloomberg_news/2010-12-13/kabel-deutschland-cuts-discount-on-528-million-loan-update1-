Kabel Deutschland Holding AG 
completed the syndication of a 400 million-euro ($528 million)
leveraged loan, cutting the discount offered to some lenders
because of demand for the debt.  Germany’s largest cable-television operator increased the
price of the six-year borrowing to 99.75 cents on the euro for
non-bank investors, compared with 99.5 cents when the loan was
first marketed, Kabel Deutschland said in a statement. The loan
was quoted above par today, according to a dealer, who declined
to be identified because the financing is private.  “Strong demand from both existing and new lenders resulted
in a book that was well oversubscribed and led to a tightening
of the initial announced pricing,” the Unterfoehring, Germany-
based company said in the statement.  The new loan, which pays 4 percentage points more than
benchmark rates, will reduce the company’s  interest  bill by
about 20 million euros a year, Kabel Deutschland said.  The loan proceeds will repay 226 million euros of its 10.75
percent notes due in 2014 and $145 million of its 10.625 percent
notes maturing the same year, the company said. It already
agreed to repay $465 million of the 10.625 percent bonds by Dec.
17.  Kabel Deutschland said on Dec. 3 it completed an amendment
to its 2 billion-euro senior credit facility that will allow it
to increase senior debt, cut junior-ranked borrowings and make
dividend payments. It also extended maturities on a revolving
credit and a term loan A by two years to March 2014.  Leveraged loans are graded below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
