Regal Beloit Corp., the electric
motor and generator manufacturer, said it will buy A.O. Smith
Corp.’s electric motor division for $875 million.  Regal, based in Beloit, Wisconsin, will acquire 100 percent
of the stock and assets of  A.O. Smith’s  Electric Products
Company for $700 million in cash and about $175 million in

transaction provides us with a more complete  product  and
technology portfolio.”  The boards of both companies agreed to the deal, which is
expected to close in the first half of 2011, according to a
