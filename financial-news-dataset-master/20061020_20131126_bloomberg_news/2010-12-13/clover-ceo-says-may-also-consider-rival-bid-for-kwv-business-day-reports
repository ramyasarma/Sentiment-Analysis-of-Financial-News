Clover Industries Ltd. may also bid
for South African wine and spirits producer KWV Holdings Ltd.,
which is considering a takeover offer from Pioneer Food Group
Ltd., Business Day said, citing Clover Chief Executive Officer
Johann Vorster.  Vorster’s interest in KWV is preliminary and hasn’t yet
been discussed with Clover’s board, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper cited the CEO as saying. Halewood International
Holdings Plc, the U.K.-based distributor of ready-made spirits,
said last week it also wants to buy KWV.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
