The outlook for the Spanish banking
system remains negative because profitability will be “severely
tested” as loan demand falls and defaults and funding costs
increase, Moody’s Investors Service said.  The country’s banking industry faces a net capital
shortfall of 17 billion euros ($22.5 billion), based on a
calculation that assumes a minimum 8 percent Tier 1 capital
ratio, Moody’s said in its outlook report today. The Tier 1
ratio is a key measure of financial strength.  Spanish lenders are grappling with mounting bad loans, weak
demand for credit and higher costs for wholesale and retail
funding as the country attempts to trim the third-biggest budget
deficit in the euro region and emerge from the worst recession
in 60 years.  Banks  in the country have only recognized 88 billion euros
of losses through writedowns and use of reserves, compared with
Moody’s base-case scenario of 176 billion euros of losses
estimated across the whole life of the industry’s loan books,
according to the ratings firm.  “We expect profitability to be seriously tested going
forward, as demand for loans will likely fall and funding costs
increase at a time when provisioning requirements remain high,”
said the report’s authors, Alberto Postigo and  Antonio Garre .  To contact the reporter on this story:
