ConocoPhillips sees Qatar as being
“at the top of the list of countries” where the company is
likely to invest, Chief Executive Officer James Mulva said.  ConocoPhillips “continues to look for opportunities” to
cooperate with the Persian Gulf state in areas such as
petrochemicals, oil and gas infrastructure, Mulva said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The Houston-based company this year pulled out of two
projects in the region, one in Saudi Arabia and the other in Abu
Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and in 2007 withdrew from a
U.A.E. refinery project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
