Nampak Ltd. , the South African
packaging company, agreed to sell its European cartons and
healthcare operations to Maximus Holding II SARL in a
transaction that values the businesses at 80 million pounds
($126 million).  The estimated net proceeds of 65 million pounds will be
used to reduce debt and invest in existing operations,
Johannesburg-based Nampak said in a statement today.  The European businesses have performed poorly since 2002,
when they were  acquired  as part of Nampak’s takeover of Malbak
Ltd., Nampak said. A review found that they were unlikely to
achieve the returns required by Nampak, it said.  Nampak  gained  the most since Nov. 25, adding 75 cents, or
3.3 percent, to 23.20 rand at the 5 p.m. close of trading in
Johannesburg, giving the company a market value of 15.3 billion
rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
