Al Golden accepted the head coaching
job at the University of Miami after leading the Temple
University football program the past five years, ESPN reported
without saying where it got the information.   Golden, 41, has helped the Owls win 17 games over the past
two years after the Philadelphia school went 1-11 in his first
season. Temple went 8-4 this season.   Golden would succeed Randy Shannon, who was fired Nov. 27
after a 7-5 season. Shannon had a 28-22 record over four seasons
at Miami, which will play Notre Dame in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
