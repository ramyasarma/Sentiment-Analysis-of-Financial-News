The homes and offices of  Ford Motor
Co.  employees and suppliers in the German cities of Cologne and
Leverkusen were searched today by prosecutors as part of a probe
into fraud and bribery allegations.  Employees at a  Ford  unit for remodeling production sites
may have accepted payments from the carmaker’s business
partners, Cologne prosecutors’ spokeswoman Christina Pohlen said
in an interview. In turn, the employees may have approved
invoices to overcharge Ford, she said.  “One person was arrested, but at the moment, we don’t want
to comment on who the person is or for whom the person is
working,” Pohlen said.  Ford’s Cologne site, where the European division is based,
was also raided.  Ford  is the victim and has been cooperating,
Pohlen said. The case stems from a similar investigation by
prosecutors in Saarbruecken, Germany. Cologne started its probe
in September.  Ford “fully backs” the investigations and is seeking
damages from the respective workers,  Bernd Meier , a spokesman
for the carmaker said today by phone. Ford may have suffered a
loss in the “single-digit” millions of euros, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
