Two U.S. senators are preparing to
propose a China currency measure as an amendment to legislation
extending tax breaks, according to two people familiar with the
proposal.  Senators  Sherrod Brown , an Ohio Democrat, and Olympia
Snowe, a Maine Republican, plan to submit the amendment today,
said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
amendment hasn’t been filed. The action may lead to a vote in
the Senate this week on the measure aimed at pressing China to
revalue it’s currency.  China amassed a $201 billion  trade surplus  with the U.S.
for the first nine months of this year, more than the U.S.
deficit with the next seven-largest trading partners combined,
according to Commerce Department data.  Lawmakers such as Senator  Charles Schumer , a New York
Democrat, have said a weak Chinese yuan is one reason for the
trade gap, and have pressed China to curb its purchase of
dollars and let its currency rise. The House passed legislation
in September letting U.S. companies petition for duties on
Chinese imports to compensate for the effect of a weak yuan.  The amendment would incorporate the House-passed measure in
the larger Senate tax bill, according to the people. It’s not
clear if Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat,
would allow a vote on the amendment, one person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
