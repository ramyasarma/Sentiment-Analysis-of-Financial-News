Franco-Nevada Corp. , a Canadian
company that gets its income from mining royalties, agreed to
acquire  Gold Wheaton Gold Corp.  for about C$830 million ($824
million) in stock and cash to boost revenue from gold
production.  Franco-Nevada will pay 0.0934 of a share and C$2.08 in
cash, valuing each Gold Wheaton share at about C$5.20,
Vancouver-based Gold Wheaton said today in a statement. Franco-
Nevada also agreed with  Quadra FNX Mining Ltd.  to acquire 56.5
million Gold Wheaton shares, representing a stake of about 35
percent in the company.  The takeover bid is 25 percent more than Gold Wheaton’s 20-
day average share price, which compares with the 27 percent
average premium in 280 gold-mining takeover offers this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Franco-Nevada manages a portfolio of royalty agreements
with mining properties. The Toronto-based company had interests
in 310 mining properties as of mid-2010, according to its
 website . Gold Wheaton purchases gold produced as a byproduct at
mines operated by other companies.  Gold Wheaton  climbed  60 cents, or 14 percent, to C$4.98 as
of 3:59 p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  Franco-Nevada 
dropped C$1.26, or 3.8 percent, to C$32.15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
