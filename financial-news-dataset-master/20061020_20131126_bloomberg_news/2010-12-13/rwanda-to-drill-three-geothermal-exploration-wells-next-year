Rwanda plans to drill three
geothermal exploration wells next year at a cost of about $20
million, said Stephen Onacha, an energy expert in the Ministry
of Infrastructure.  “When we confirm geothermal resources in the first well,
we will begin developing it for electricity generation
immediately,” Onacha said in an interview on Dec. 11 from
Gishenyi, western Rwanda, where geologists think the resource is
located. It won’t “wait to drill all other exploration wells.”  Rwanda wants to expand its generating capacity to 1,000
megawatts in seven years from 85 megawatts, Coleta Ruhamya,
state minister for energy told reporters on Dec. 7. That
generating capacity will include 300 megawatts of geothermal
energy, she said.  The government secured grants of $4.5 million from the
World Bank’s Global Environment Facility and 4 million euros
($5.3 million) from the Nordic Development Fund for a renewable
energy project, the Ministry of Infrastructure said on Dec. 9.
The money will form a grant and credit program for electricity
consumers to buy solar systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
