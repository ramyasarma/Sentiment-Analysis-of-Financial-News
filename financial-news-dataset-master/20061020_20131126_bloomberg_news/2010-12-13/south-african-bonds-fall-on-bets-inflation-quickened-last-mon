South African bonds fell for the
first time in three days on speculation a government report
tomorrow will show inflation accelerated for a second month,
reducing the likelihood of further interest rate cuts.  The benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 fell
20 cents to 123.95 rand by 4:28 p.m. in Johannesburg, lifting
the yield by 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.42
percent. The rand gained 0.5 percent to 6.8317 per dollar.  Consumer price growth  in Africa’s biggest economy
accelerated to 3.5 percent in November, from 3.4 percent in
October, according to the  median forecast  in a Bloomberg survey.  “In a thin market most of the focus for the next day or so
will be on the inflation data tomorrow,”  Jonathan Myerson , head
of fixed-interest at Cadiz Asset Management, which oversees
about 50 billion rand ($7.3 billion), said in a telephone
interview from Cape Town. “The number is likely to be
marginally higher than the previous month.”  South African inflation slowed to a five-year low of 3.2
percent in September, nearing the lower limit of the central
bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range, as a 37 percent
rally in the rand since the start of 2009 curbed the cost of
imported oil. The slowing inflation enabled the  Reserve Bank  to
cut its benchmark interest rate to 5.5 percent last month, the
lowest level since the so-called repurchase rate was introduced
in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
