New Zealand’s economy will expand at
a slower pace than previously predicted amid sluggish consumer
spending, according to a survey of economic forecasters.  Gross domestic product will increase by 2.1 percent in the
year ending March 31, 2011, according to the average estimate of
10 economists surveyed by the Wellington-based New Zealand
Institute of Economic Research Inc. Three months ago, they
forecast a 2.8 percent expansion. Growth will be 3.5 percent in
the year through March 31, 2012, stronger than the previous
prediction of 3.1 percent, according to the survey.  “Economic data has been disappointing since the September
release,” the institute said today in an e-mailed statement.
“These are consistent with slowing economic conditions before
recovery from mid-2011.”  Slower near-term growth adds to signs that the central bank
will keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged until the second
quarter next year. Governor  Alan Bollard  last week lowered his
2010 growth forecast and increased his 2011 projection, saying
rebuilding after a magnitude 7 earthquake that struck the South
Island city of Christchurch in September will buoy activity over
the next two years.  The quarterly survey includes the forecasts of the Reserve
Bank, Treasury Department, seven bank economists and the
institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
