All-Star forward  Carmelo Anthony 
told the Denver Nuggets he won’t sign the $65 million contract
extension he’s been offered unless he’s traded to the New York
Knicks,  ESPN reported , citing an unidentified person familiar
with the private discussions.  Anthony, 26, received a standing ovation from Knicks’ fans
during player introductions before New York’s 129-125 win over
the Nuggets yesterday at Madison Square Garden. It was the
Knicks’ eighth straight win, their longest winning streak since
the 1994-95 National Basketball Association season.  The Nuggets have until the NBA’s Feb. 24 trade deadline to
deal Anthony otherwise they’d probably lose him without
compensation as an unrestricted free agent after the season.  Anthony has told the Nuggets he won’t sign a three-year
extension unless he’s traded to the Knicks, ESPN said. Anthony,
who was born in New York and attended Syracuse University, told
reporters yesterday that he doesn’t think the Nuggets will trade
him to a team he doesn’t want to play for.  The 6-foot-8 Anthony has averaged 22.8 points and eight
rebounds this season for the Nuggets, who fell to 14-9. He had
31 points and 13 rebounds against the Knicks yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
