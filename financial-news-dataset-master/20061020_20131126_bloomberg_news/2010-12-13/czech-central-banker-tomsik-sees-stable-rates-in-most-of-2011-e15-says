Czech interest rates will probably
remain stable for “a majority” of 2011, central bank Vice
Governor Vladimir Tomsik said in an interview with newspaper
e15.  A debate about timing of adoption of the euro is “not a
realistic or interesting theme,” Tomsik told the newspaper in
the interview published today. “I am deeply convinced that the
Czech Republic is being helped by its own currency.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
