U.S. stocks pared gains as declines
in financial shares helped offset optimism after China refrained
from raising interest rates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,242.32 at 9:41 a.m. New York time after climbing as much as
0.3 percent. Huntington Bancshares Inc., the Ohio bank that has
yet to repay $1.4 billion in U.S. bailout funds, lost 6.3
percent after saying it will sell $920 million of shares.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
