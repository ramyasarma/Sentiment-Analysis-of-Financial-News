Ken Oberkfell will be  Terry Collins ’s bench coach for the New York Mets’ 2011 season, with
 Dave Hudgens  replacing  Howard Johnson  as hitting coach and
 Mookie Wilson  reassuming the first-base coach role.  Jon Debus will become the team’s bullpen coach,  Dan Warthen 
will again serve as pitching coach and  Chip Hale  will return at
third base, the Mets said in a news release.  Oberkfell, a 16-year Major League Baseball infielder, was
promoted from Triple-A Buffalo, where he went 76-68 last season
as the team’s manager. In six years managing at that level for
New York, Oberkfell went 379-409.  He’ll assist Collins, who was hired Nov. 22 by new Mets
General Manager  Sandy Alderson .  Hudgens was the Cleveland Indians’ field coordinator for
the past five seasons and was the hitting coach for the Oakland
Athletics in 1999 and from 2003-2005.  Under Johnson’s direction, the Mets’ .249 batting average
last season was 22nd among baseball’s 30 franchises, while their
656 runs scored  ranked 24th . New York finished with a 79-83
record, 18 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies in the
National League East.  Wilson, who played for the Mets from 1980-1989, was the
team’s first-base coach from 1997-2002. He returned to the
organization last season as minor-league outfield and base-
running coordinator after being out of baseball the four
previous years.  Debus was a professional scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers
the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
