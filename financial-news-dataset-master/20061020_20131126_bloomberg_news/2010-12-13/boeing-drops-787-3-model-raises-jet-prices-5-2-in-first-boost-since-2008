Boeing Co . is raising aircraft
prices by about 5.2 percent, the first increase in two years,
and dropping the short-haul version of the 787 Dreamliner.  Higher costs for wages, goods and services are driving the
boost, said  Jim Proulx , a spokesman at Boeing’s commercial
headquarters in Seattle. He confirmed the changes made to the
price list on Chicago-based Boeing’s  website  today as well as
the withdrawal of the 787-3 variant.  Boeing’s last price increase, an average 2.6 percent boost,
was for 2008, Proulx said. Prices were raised 5.6 percent in
2007. Most carriers and leasing companies get discounts.  “If I were an airline, I’d be reading this as a message
that Boeing thinks it can get higher prices because demand is
rising and supply is limited, but you’ll still have the usual
discussion over discounts,” said  Rob Stallard , an analyst at
RBC Capital Markets in New York. “Boeing and Airbus deeply
discount to airlines, so theoretically they could raise list
prices and boost the discounts, and it would all be the same.”  Boeing  and larger rival  Airbus SAS  are pushing production
rates to records to work through a seven-year backlog of orders
from carriers seeking to expand and refresh their fleets with
more fuel-efficient jets. Demand is recovering this year after
dipping in 2009 amid the recession.  The average price for the smallest Boeing jet, the single-
aisle 737, is now about $71.4 million, up from about $69.3
million. The 777’s list price rose to about $258.2 million from
$246 million. The two 787 models still being offered now average
$201.7 million, up from $183.3 million, according to Boeing’s
website.  Japanese Airliner Market  The 787-3 was designed to carry as many as 330 passengers
as far as 3,500 miles (5,600 kilometers), compared with the 787-
8’s top capacity of 250 people and 9,400-mile range. Boeing has
been reviewing the model’s future after All Nippon Airways Co.
swapped its 787-3 order for another variant in January.  All Nippon had been the last carrier to hold an order for
the 787-3, which was designed specifically for the Japanese
market.  Boeing diverted resources from the short-haul model in 2008
as it struggled to move the long-distance 787-8 toward
production amid problems with parts shortages, redesigns and
incomplete work by suppliers. The Dreamliner’s entry into
service is now running about three years behind schedule.  Boeing fell 37 cents to $63.79 at 4:15 p.m. in New York

percent since the first Dreamliner delay was announced in
October 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
