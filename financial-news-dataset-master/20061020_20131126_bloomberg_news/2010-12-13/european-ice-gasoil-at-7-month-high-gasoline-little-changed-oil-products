European gasoil pared gains after
earlier hitting a seven-month high on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Gasoil prices were still buoyed by freezing
weather in the region and rising crude prices, analysts said.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc was active in oil products markets,
buying gasoline and jet fuel.  Light Products  Premium unleaded gasoline barges for immediate loading in
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $834 to $840 a metric ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  BP Plc, Statoil ASA and Neste Oil Oyj were the main
sellers. Shell and Trafigura Beheer BV were buyers.  Eurobob-grade gasoline barges changed hands at $816 to $823
a ton throughout the day, according to traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That’s down from the Dec.
10 trading range of $819 to $824. Ethanol is added to Eurobob
grade to make the finished fuel.  The  gasoline crack , or premium to Brent crude, was at $5.68
a barrel, little changed from Dec. 10, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for January delivery rose as much as 1.8 percent, or
$13.75 a ton, to $774.75 a ton. That’s the highest price since
May 3, when the contract settled at $781.50 a ton. It was at
$762.50 a ton as of 5:48 p.m. local time.  “In the next few days, temperatures in northwest Europe
are expected to return to very cold levels, supporting heating
oil and fuel oil demand,” Christophe Barret, global oil analyst
at Credit Agricole SA in London, said in a research note.  Increased heating oil consumption in Germany is likely to
deplete consumer stocks there, Barret said.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profit, narrowed 52
cents to $11.16 a barrel versus Dec. 10, ICE data show. Brent
crude for January rose 0.4 percent to $90.83 a barrel.  Shell also bought a barge of jet fuel from Gekol
Mineraloelhandel GmbH at a premium of $57.50 to ICE’s January
gasoil futures contract. The differential shrank from Dec. 10
trades at $58 and $59.  Refinery News  Dow Chemical Co. started a naphtha cracker at its Terneuzen
chemicals site in the Netherlands today after a fault.  “There was a technical problem with the process of cracker
2,” Drea Berghorst, a Dow spokeswoman, said in a telephone
interview from the site. “The problem is already solved and
it’s already starting up again.”  The cracker, which has a capacity to produce 580,000 tons
of ethylene a year, is one of three at the Terneuzen site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
