Taipei Financial Center Corp., owner
of the world’s second-tallest building, expects to report its
first annual profit since it began operating in 2004 as the
number of Chinese tourists more than doubled.  Net income will likely reach about NT$200 million ($6.65
million) this year from a loss of NT$178.5 million in 2009,
Michael Liu, spokesman for Taipei Financial Center, said in an
interview. The company posted a NT$123.6 million profit in the
first half of the year, Liu said.  Chinese visitors are increasing their presence in Taiwan
after the governments in Taipei and Beijing eased restrictions
and improved economic ties following Taiwan President  Ma Ying- jeou ’s inauguration in May 2008. Average daily Chinese tourist
numbers more than doubled to 3,440 in the first half of this
year from 1,661 in 2009,  Janice Lai , director-general of the
Tourism Bureau, said last month.  “Chinese tourists are a great help to our business,” Liu
said. “They boost ticket sales at our observatory. They also
contribute about 13 percent of the sales to our mall business.”  Lower interest payments also helped cut expenses of the
skyscraper, Liu said.  The 508-meter (1,667-foot) Taipei 101, completed in 2004,
ceded its position as the world’s tallest building to Burj
Khalifa in Dubai in January. More than 10,000 people work in its
offices and it also has a shopping mall.  Taipei 101  targets a full occupancy rate at the end of next
year, from about 85 percent currently, Liu added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
