JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut a large
position in the U.S. silver futures market, the Financial Times
said, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.
The decision was made to try to deflect public criticism of its
dealings in silver, the FT said. The bank declined to comment on
whether it had cut its position, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
