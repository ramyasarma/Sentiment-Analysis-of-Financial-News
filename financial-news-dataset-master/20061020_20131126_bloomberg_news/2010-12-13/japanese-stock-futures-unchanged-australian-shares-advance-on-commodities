Japanese  stock   futures  were
unchanged as the yen strengthened while a proposed reduction in
Japan’s corporate tax boosted expectations for earnings.
Australian stocks rose on commodities.  American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. , a
carmaker that counts North America as its biggest market, slid
0.3 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of
Komatsu Ltd., the world’s second-largest maker of construction
and mining equipment, climbed 0.7 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd.,
the world’s No. 1 mining company, advanced 0.7 percent in Sydney
today after oil and metal prices increased yesterday.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 10,275 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,275 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,270
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:20 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index rose 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.1 percent in Wellington.  “The yen’s appreciation will weigh on exporters,” said
 Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tachibana
Securities Co. “A tax cut would be positive for Japanese
companies and expectations for corporate earnings will increase.
This should support the market.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. In New York, the index gained 0.06 point to
1,240.46, after rising as much as 0.5 percent, as the Senate
started to vote on President Barack Obama’s tax-cut agreement
with Republicans, and investors turned their attention to the
Federal Reserve meeting on Dec. 14.  Tax Vote  After U.S. exchanges closed, Obama’s deal to extend tax
cuts enacted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, received enough
votes to proceed in the Senate. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and
policy makers meet tomorrow for the last time in 2010.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 11 percent through
yesterday in 2010, matching the gain by the S&P 500 and beating
the 9.1 percent increase by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.9 times estimated
 earnings  on average, compared with 14.5 times for the S&P 500
and 12.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called for a 5
percentage point cut in the nation’s corporate tax rate, Kyodo
News reported, citing government officials it didn’t identify.  The yen appreciated to 83.11 against the dollar, compared
with 84.15 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 112.07 from
111.03.  Crude oil for January delivery increased 0.9 percent to
settle at $88.61 a barrel in New York yesterday. Copper futures
rose to a record of $9,235.25 in London. The London Metal
Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals including
copper and aluminum rose 2.2 percent yesterday.  The 25-day Toraku index, a measure of daily stock winners
and losers on the Topix, was 149 yesterday. A level of more than
120 suggests to some investors the market is poised to fall.  To contact the reporter for this story:
