Petroleos de Venezuela SA plans to
sell $2 billion of bonds to the central bank to repay a loan,
said a government official with direct knowledge of the
transaction.  The bond sale will take place before the end of December,
said the official, who asked to stay anonymous because the plan
isn’t public. With the bond sale, the state-run oil company will
have practically repaid the full amount of the loan, the person
said.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is known, sold $3
billion of 8.5 percent bonds in 2017 at par value in October.
The company sold the central bank $1.6 billion of bonds due in
2014 in August to repay part of the loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
