Copper prices climbed to a record in
London and closed at an all-time high in New York after China
refrained from raising borrowing costs over the weekend,
bolstering speculation that metal demand will continue to rise.  Last week, China increased reserve-requirement ratios for
banks by half a percentage point amid accelerating inflation.
The country, the world’s largest metal user, said on Dec. 10
that imports of copper and copper products gained for the first
time in three months.  “The fact that China didn’t raise rates provided
optimism,” said  Phil Streible , a senior strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “We’re seeing a continuation of
investor buying.”  Copper for delivery in three months gained $235, or 2.6
percent, to close at $9,225 ($4.18 a pound) at 6:11 p.m. on the
London Metal Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $9,248, the
highest ever.  The rally will continue next year, and copper at “$10,000
is definitely in sight,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
 Commerzbank AG  in Frankfurt.  In New York, copper futures for March delivery rose 9.5
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $4.207 a pound on the Comex, the
highest closing price ever. After the settlement, the metal
reached $4.222, the highest intraday price since May 5, 2008,
when the commodity climbed an all-time high of $4.2605.  Copper may reach $4.30 by the end of the year and advance
to $4.50 in the first quarter of 2011, Streible said.  In New York, copper has surged 46 percent since July 1 as
global inventories dwindled. The introduction of exchange-traded
products backed by the metal also boosted prices.  Lead, nickel, tin, zinc and aluminum also gained in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
