Sugar climbed to a one-month high in
New York on signs that heavy rains may limit supplies and reduce
exports from India. Cocoa was little changed.  Sugar production in India, the world’s biggest grower after
Brazil, will drop for a second consecutive year, ABN Amro Bank
NV and VM Group said Dec. 10, after a “terrible” monsoon in
2009 cut output and this year’s monsoon flooded fields in some
areas such as Uttar Pradesh. Prices have doubled in New York
since the end of May.  “The polls coming out on the Indian surplus are slowly
reducing,”  Jonathan Bouchet , an analyst at OTCex Group in
Geneva, said today by e-mail. “Demand for Indian sugar remains
strong.”  Raw sugar for March delivery added 1.36 cents, or 4.7
percent, to settle at 30.49 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York at 2 p.m. New York time. Earlier, the price reached
30.53 cents, the highest since Nov. 11.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery gained
$32.70, or 4.5 percent, to settle at $755.20 a metric ton on
NYSE Liffe. Earlier, the price reached $759 a ton, the highest
for a most-active contract since Nov. 11.  Cocoa futures for March delivery rose $3, or 0.1 percent,
in New York to $2,890 a ton. In London, cocoa futures for March
