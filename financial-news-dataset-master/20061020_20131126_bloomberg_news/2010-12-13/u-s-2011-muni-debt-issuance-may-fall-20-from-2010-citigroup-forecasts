Municipal-bond issuance may drop 20
percent next year to about $340 billion, in part because of a
likely decline in advance refundings,  Citigroup Inc.  analysts
said in a research note.  First-quarter sales may fall as much as 25 percent to $75
billion because borrowers moved up issues planned for early 2011
to this year to take advantage of expiring federally supported
debt programs, the analysts said in the Dec. 10 report. The 30
new governors entering office next month and possible “fiscal
conservatism” related to the Tea Party’s influence may help
slow municipal sales, according to the research note.  “This is not meant to suggest that longer-term demands for
funding of infrastructure aren’t large and growing,” the
analysts, led by  George Friedlander  in New York, wrote in the
report. “We are only suggesting that 2011 is not likely to be a
year in which large amounts of this are funded through muni
issuance.”  Advance refundings, whereby issuers refinance debt to take
advantage of lower prevailing interest rates, may decline in
2011 because many states and localities did so this year,
Citigroup said.  Issuance in 2010 is approaching the $430 billion record set
in 2007, Citigroup said. Municipal yields are unlikely to move
“significantly higher” next year because the reduced supply
should meet demand, according to the report.  Build America Bonds, which include a 35 percent federal
subsidy on interest rates, have allowed state and local
governments to borrow at a lower cost than traditional tax-
exempt debt does. President  Barack Obama  and congressional
Republicans left the program out of a tax deal they reached last
week, hastening issuers to market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
