The benchmark DAX Index was little
changed after German investor confidence improved for a second
month and U.S. retail sales surpassed estimates.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  climbed 1.7 percent after Credit
Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation on the shares.
 ThyssenKrupp AG , Germany’s largest steelmaker, fell after
Finnish rival  Outokumpu Oyj  said fourth-quarter earnings would
be weaker than expected.  The  DAX  slipped less than 0.1 percent to 7,027.4 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, a day after reaching its highest
level since May 2008. The gauge has jumped 18 percent in 2010 as
corporate profits rose, the Federal Reserve unveiled a $600
billion bond purchase program to assist the U.S. economic
recovery and the European Union bailed out Greece and Ireland.
The broader HDAX Index also fell less than 0.1 percent today.  “The DAX is at its highest in over two years so it isn’t
strange investors are taking a bit of a breather,” said  Peter Braendle , a fund manager at Swisscanto Asset Management AG in
Zurich, which oversees $62 billion. “It’s reassuring that
today’s ZEW figure beat estimates. It shows the rebound is still
headed in the right direction.”  German investor confidence improved for a second month in
December as the recovery in Europe’s largest economy shows signs
of broadening.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict developments six months ahead, increased to 4.3 from
1.8 in November. Economists expected a gain to 3.9, according to
the median of 36 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. Retail Sales  Sales at U.S. retailers climbed in November for a fifth
consecutive month as holiday shopping got under way, a sign
consumers will play a bigger role in the recovery, economists
said before a report today.  Purchases increased 0.8 percent, following a 1.7 percent
gain in October that was larger than previously estimated,
Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for
a 0.6 percent rise. Excluding autos, gasoline and building
materials, which are the figures used to calculate gross
domestic product, sales climbed 0.9 percent, the most since
August.  Lufthansa rose 1.7 percent to 17.34 euros, rebounding from
yesterday’s 0.4 percent fall. The airline was raised to
“outperform” from “neutral” at Credit Suisse, which said it
“expects premium revenues are set to continue to grow at
attractive rates in 2011.”  ThyssenKrupp, ProSiebenSat.1  ThyssenKrupp fell 1.5 percent to 31.16 euros. Outokumpu
fell as much as 8.9 percent in Helsinki after saying its fourth-
quarter result will be weaker than previously forecast.
Operating profit will be “clearly negative” rather than around
breakeven, the company said.  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG  slumped 5.7 percent to 21.68 euros,
its second decline. Germany’s biggest private broadcaster may be
sold by  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  & Co. and Permira LLP in 2011,
the Die Welt newspaper reported, citing unidentified people in
the financial markets.  TUI AG  climbed 5.1 percent to 9.83 euros, its sixth day of
gains. The tour operator reported full-year net income fell to
101.8 million euros from 170.4 million euros, as revenue
declined.  Carmakers  Volkswagen  and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG 
retreated 1.9 percent to 128.90 euros and 1.5 percent to 62.47
euros, respectively. Automobile related shares were the biggest
loser today among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, falling 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
