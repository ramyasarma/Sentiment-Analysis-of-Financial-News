World steeplechase champion  Marta
Dominguez  may lose multiple titles if there’s proof she doped,
 Jose Maria Odriozola , president of the Spanish track and field
federation, said today.  Dominguez, described as Spain’s “Grand Dame” of track and
field by El Pais newspaper, is one of 14 people being
investigated after police said they broke up a doping ring last
week. Dominguez, 35, denied drugs were found in a raid on her
house in Palencia last week, Efe newswire reported, citing
written answers to its questions. Her responses didn’t directly
address whether she doped.  The situation may mirror that of American sprinter  Marion Jones , who was stripped of the five medals she won at the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney after confessing she used steroids in
2007. Dominguez, who holds several Spanish records and titles,
was questioned by police last week when she was also suspended
as vice-president of the national track and field federation.  “There will be a retrospective investigation, and if
necessary, all the results and titles will be canceled, as in
the case of Marion Jones,” Odriozola told a televised news
conference.  Dominguez said police had told her she was “simply a
witness” in an investigation into drug trafficking that began
eight months ago, Efe reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
