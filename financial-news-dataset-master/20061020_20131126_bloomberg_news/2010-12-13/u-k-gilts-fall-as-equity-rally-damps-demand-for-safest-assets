U.K. government bonds fell for a
second day as equity markets advanced, diminishing demand for
the perceived safety of fixed-income securities.  The decline drove the  yield  on the 10-year gilt within
three basis points of the highest in almost six months after
better-than-forecast economic U.S. data last week spurred demand
for riskier assets. U.S. consumer  confidence  rose in December to
a six-month high, a report showed on Dec. 10. China refrained
from increasing interest rates, boosting Asian stocks. The FTSE
100  Index  rose the most since Dec. 2, climbing 0.8 percent.
Sterling, which weakened against most of its main counterparts,
erased earlier losses against the dollar.  “Equity markets are stronger and making good headway, so
gilts are losing out as safe-haven demand recedes,” said  Peter Chatwell , an interest-rates strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate and Investment Bank in London. “The market may
struggle to hold the 3.5 percent yield level on the 10-year.”  The 10-year gilt yield gained four basis points to 3.56
percent as of 4:30 p.m. in London. The 4.75 percent security due
March 2020 fell 0.35, or 3.5 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,585)
face amount, to 109.30. The yield reached 3.58 percent on Dec.
9, the highest since June 15, according to Bloomberg generic
data. The two-year yield rose six basis points to 1.16 percent.  Inflation  Gilts stayed lower after a report showed U.K. raw material
costs increased in November for a third month.  Input prices  rose
0.9 percent, compared with 2.2 percent in October, the Office
for National Statistics said today in London. The median
forecast of 11 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
0.5 percent increase. On the year, prices climbed 9 percent.  Bank of England policy makers last week held their asset-
purchase program unchanged at 200 billion pounds after inflation
remained above the 3 percent limit for an eighth month. Governor
 Mervyn King  has said that consumer-price gains will stay
“elevated” next year. Inflation has been stoked by higher
costs of imports, partly reflecting the weakness of the pound.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee kept the
central bank’s benchmark interest rate at a record low 0.5
percent at its meeting on Dec. 9.  Deputy Governor  Charles Bean  said the strength of inflation
has increased the risk to price expectations and there may also
be less spare capacity in the economy than previously assumed.  “Given the unexpected strength of inflation in recent
months, this risk has probably increased of late,” Bean said in
a speech at an event organized by Market News International in
London today. Moreover, the high rate of inflation “could
indicate that the margin of spare capacity is not as large as
the collapse in activity might suggest,” he added.  ‘Highly Uncertain’  The outlook for growth still “remains highly uncertain,”
Bean said.  Gilts returned 6 percent this year, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries gained 5.6 percent and
German debt, the euro-area’s benchmark securities, returned 6
percent, the EFFAS indexes show.  The U.K.’s Debt Management Office plans to sell 3.5 billion
pounds of securities maturing in January 2016 on Dec. 15.  The pound weakened against 11 of its 16 most-actively
traded peers as a report showed U.K. house prices fell for a
second straight month.  Pound  Home sellers cut  asking prices  for a second month in
December to the lowest level in almost a year and may reduce
them by a further 5 percent in 2011,  Rightmove Plc  said.  Average asking prices in England and Wales fell 3 percent
to 222,410 pounds from November, when they dropped 3.2 percent,
the operator of Britain’s biggest property website said in a
report published in London today. That’s the biggest consecutive
monthly drop since Rightmove’s index began in 2002.  Sterling depreciated 0.8 percent to 84.33 pence per euro.
The pound strengthened against the dollar as the greenback
depreciated against most currencies, gaining 0.3 percent to
$1.5852, after earlier dropping as much as 0.5 percent to
$1.5720. It reached $1.5862 on Dec. 10, its strongest level
since Nov. 23.  “Investors may be underestimating the scale of the
anticipated slowdown in the U.K. next year,”  Ian Stannard , a
senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London, said in
an interview today. He said sterling may move towards 85.20
pence this week.  Sterling has gained 0.6 percent in the past week, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track
a basket of 10 developed-country currencies.  Since the end of 2009, Britain’s currency has lost 4.1
percent, compared with a 9.2 percent decline by the euro and a 2
percent loss by the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
