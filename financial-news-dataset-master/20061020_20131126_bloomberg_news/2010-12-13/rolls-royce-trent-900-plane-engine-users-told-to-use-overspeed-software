Users of Rolls-Royce Group Plc Trent
900 engines, the type that exploded on a Qantas Airways Ltd.
flight on Nov. 4, should install software in order to detect
turbine discs spinning too quickly, the European Aviation Safety
Agency said.  Rolls-Royce developed software to detect conditions which
may lead to the engine exceeding a safe speed and shut it down
before it reaches a speed at which the disc would burst, the
regulator said today in a so-called airworthiness directive on
its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
