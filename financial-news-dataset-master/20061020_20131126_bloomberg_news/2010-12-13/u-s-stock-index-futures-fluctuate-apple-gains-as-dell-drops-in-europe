U.S. stocks erased gains in the
final hour of trading as the Senate started to vote on President
 Barack Obama ’s tax-cut agreement with Republicans and investors
turned their attention to the Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow.  Consumer shares led losses in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, which rallied earlier after China refrained from raising
interest rates. J.C. Penney Co. fell 3.3 percent and Urban
Outfitters Inc. retreated 2.8 percent. Compellent Technologies
Inc. declined 2.5 percent after Dell Inc. agreed to buy the
storage area network producer for $960 million.  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc.  rose 2.4 percent as metals prices jumped.  Four stocks fell for  every  three that rallied on U.S. stock
exchanges. The S&P 500 rose 0.06 point to 1,240.46 at 4 p.m. New
York time. It climbed as high as 1,246.73, almost surpassing
1,251.70, or its last closing level before Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s 2008 bankruptcy sent the S&P 500 to a 46 percent
plunge through March 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
advanced 18.24 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,428.56.  “I suspect the Senate cloture vote is the reason” stocks
dropped at the end of the day, said  Barry Knapp , head of equity
strategy for Barclays Plc in New York. “The trading floor was
extremely quiet.”  After U.S. exchanges closed, Obama’s deal to extend tax
cuts enacted by his predecessor,  George W. Bush , received enough
votes to proceed in the Senate. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
convenes policy makers tomorrow for their last meeting of 2010.  S&P 500 Performance  The S&P 500 has risen 21 percent since July 2 as the Fed
pledged another $600 billion to buy bonds and as more than 70
percent of companies in the index beat analysts’ estimates for
third-quarter profit, a record sixth straight period that many
exceeded projections.  “The market’s probably showing people aren’t sure what the
Fed’s going to say tomorrow,” said  Walter Todd , who helps
manage about $900 million at Greenwood Capital Associates in
Greenwood, South Carolina. “This morning there were some pretty
good indications that this tax deal was going to get done, we
had the China news out over the weekend, all those things were
positive for the market. As you’ve gone throughout the day
people started to say, ’Well, the Fed’s coming tomorrow, we’re
not sure what they’re going to say, we have some economic data
coming out later this week.’”  Consumer Companies  Consumer discretionary companies dropped the most out of 10
industry groups in the S&P 500, declining 0.5 percent.  J.C.
Penney  slumped 3.3 percent to $32.83. Urban Outfitters slid 2.8
percent to $36.15, while the New York Times Co. sank 2.7 percent
to $9.35.  Stocks earlier gained as much as 0.5 percent after the
People’s Bank of China, which on Dec. 10 raised reserve-
requirement ratios for banks by half a percentage point, didn’t
increase interest rates.  The benchmark index for U.S. stock options pared losses,
falling 0.3 percent, after declining as much as 5.3 percent
earlier. The VIX, as the  Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index  is known, slipped to 17.55.  Compellent Technologies declined 2.5 percent to $27.98.
Dell agreed to buy Compellent for $27.75 a share, to gain data-
storage technology. Dell, the world’s third-largest personal-
computer maker, fell 3.9 percent to $13.36.  Technology companies 
had the second-biggest decline in the S&P 500, falling 0.3
percent, after earlier rising as much as 0.5 percent.  Energy Shares  Freeport-McMoRan rose 2.4 percent to $115.53 as copper
reached a 31-month high. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S.
energy producer, helped lead energy shares to the biggest gain
out of the 10 S&P 500 industry groups, as crude oil rose above
$88 a barrel in New York and General Electric Co. bought
Wellstream Holdings Plc for $1.3 billion.  Shares of San Ramon, California-based Chevron climbed 1.5
percent to $88.37, the  biggest gain  in the Dow, while National
Oilwell Varco Inc. gained 2.1 percent to $63.99. Cabot Oil & Gas
Corp. jumped 4.5 percent to $36.95, the second-biggest rise in
the S&P 500. Cabot, a Houston-based natural gas producer,
received an air quality permit for its Lathrop Compressor
Station to begin construction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
