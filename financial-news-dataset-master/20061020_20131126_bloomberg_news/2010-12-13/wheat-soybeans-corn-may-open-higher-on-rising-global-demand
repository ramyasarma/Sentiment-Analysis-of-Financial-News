What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on speculation that demand for
U.S. supplies will increase as heavy rains erode grain quality
in Australia, said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 14 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT after China’s central bank refrained from an
interest-rate increase that would curb demand for animal feed
and cooking oils made from the oilseed, Grow said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open up 0.7 cent to 0.8 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that rising demand for animal
feed and ethanol will leave smaller U.S. inventories than the
15-year low forecast by the government on Dec. 10, Grow said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
