Former  UBS AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Marcel Rohner  will take a 5 percent stake in a new Swiss
bank that will open for business next year.  The bank, founded by  Thomas Matter  and  Daniel Hefti , will
have equity capital of 20 million francs and 10 million francs
($10.3 million) in additional paid-in capital, according to an
e-mailed statement from the company today.  Rohner, 46, who worked for UBS and its predecessors since
1992, was appointed CEO of Switzerland’s biggest bank in July
2007 as it began recording the first of more than $50 billion in
writedowns and losses related to the credit crisis. He was
replaced by  Oswald Gruebel , 67, in February 2009.  The new bank, which received a license from the Swiss
regulator earlier this month, will focus on wealth management
and advice, corporate finance and research. The name of the
company, which will employ about 30 employees at the beginning,
has not been disclosed.  Hefti, a former chief financial officer of bank Swissfirst
AG, will be the CEO and own 8 percent of the company, according
to the statement. Matter, a co-founder and former CEO of
Swissfirst, will be the chairman with a 30 percent stake.  Swissfirst changed its name in 2006 to Bellevue Group AG
after Matter resigned as CEO amid a probe into possible insider
trading. The investigation was dropped by Zurich prosecutors in
2008 because of a lack of evidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
