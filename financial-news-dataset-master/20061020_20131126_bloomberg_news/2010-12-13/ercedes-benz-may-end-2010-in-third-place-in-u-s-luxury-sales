Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz brand may
sell fewer luxury vehicles in the U.S. this year than Toyota
Motor Corp.’s Lexus and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s namesake
BMW brand, a Mercedes executive said.  “I’m pretty sure we’ll be No. 3,”  Ernst Lieb , president
of Mercedes-Benz’s U.S. unit, told reporters yesterday at an
event in Detroit. Mercedes and BMW this year have narrowed the
gap in luxury cars and sport-utility vehicle sales with Lexus,
which has held the top spot in the U.S. since 2000.  Lexus maintained its lead over BMW by 4,936 vehicles sold
through November, according to data released by the companies,
while BMW outsold Mercedes by 545 vehicles. The totals don’t
include non-luxury models such as  BMW’s  Mini cars and Stuttgart,
Germany-based Daimler’s Smart cars and Sprinter vans.  Lexus will keep its lead for the year, Lieb said in an
interview following a lunch with reporters. “Nobody’s going to
make up” the difference, he said.  He expects BMW to finish second, he said. “They are
pushing extremely hard,” he said.  “If you go back four years ago, Lexus was 75,000 units
ahead of us and  BMW  was over 40,000 units ahead of us,” Lieb
said. “At the end of the year with Lexus being, I don’t know,
6,000 units ahead of us, and BMW, 1,500, I think that’s a pretty
good achievement.”  Shares Drop  Daimler  fell as much as 52 cents, or 1 percent, to 54.24
euros and was down 0.3 percent as of 12:59 p.m. in Frankfurt
trading. The shares have gained 47 percent this year, valuing
the carmaker at 58.1 billion euros ($78.2 billion). BMW was down
1.3 percent to 62.62 euros.  Early sales data for December don’t show Mercedes and BMW
surging past Lexus’s lead for the year, said  Jesse Toprak , an
industry analyst with TrueCar.com, a website that tracks vehicle
sales.  “It will be very difficult for Benz or BMW to catch up to
them unless they do something unusual for the remainder of the
month,” Toprak said in a telephone interview Dec. 10.  Luxury sales have been more robust than last year with the
U.S. economy improving and better access to leasing deals, he
said. “We are seeing more than usual increases in luxury
sales,” Toprak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
