Copper advanced from London to
Shanghai as China, the world’s largest consumer, refrained from
raising borrowing costs even as inflation surged, and as the
country’s imports of the metal rebounded.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.8 percent to $9,065 a metric ton by
9:07 a.m. Singapore time. It reached a record $9,091 on Dec. 9.  Copper for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained as much as 1.7 percent to 68,480 yuan a ton, the highest
price since Nov. 12, while  futures on the Comex in New York
climbed as much as 0.7 percent to $4.140 a pound.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
