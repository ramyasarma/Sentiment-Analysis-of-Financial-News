Andras Simor, governor of Hungary’s
central bank, said the government will be disappointed if it
tries to influence the bank’s interest-rate decisions by gaining
control over the Monetary Policy Council, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing an interview. New members of the MPC
will find their responsibilities determined by the Central Bank
Act “not by who appointed you or what they said to you last
week,” Simor said, according to the Journal.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
