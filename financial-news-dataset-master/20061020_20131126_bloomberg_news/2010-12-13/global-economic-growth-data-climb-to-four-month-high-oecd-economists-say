The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said its leading indicator rose to
the highest in four months in October as faster growth in China
and the U.S. offset signs of slowdowns in Brazil and India.  The  measure  increased 0.1 point from September to 102.6,
the Paris-based organization said in an e-mailed statement
today. October’s number was the highest since June and gains
were led by the U.S., China and Russia, the OECD said.  The data “suggest a stabilization in the pace of expansion
across the OECD,” the organization said. The indicators show
signs of improvement for the U.S., China and France and
continued expansion in Russia, though “downturn signals” are
evident for Canada, Italy and India, while Brazil “remains in a
slowdown phase.”  The OECD’s leading economic indicator aims to signal when
the direction of the economy is changing, with any level below
100 signifying a contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
