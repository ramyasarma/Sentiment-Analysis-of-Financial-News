China’s relationship with India is
“fragile,” the Financial Times cited the Chinese ambassador as
saying.  The links between the two countries are “very easy to be
damaged and very difficult to repair,” Ambassador Zhang Yan
said yesterday, according to the report. India’s Foreign
Secretary Nirupama Rao said the two countries need to cooperate
in a spirit of “competition and collaboration,” the Financial
Times said. The comments come ahead of a visit to India by
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
