Freeworld Coatings Ltd. , a South
African maker of decorative coatings, rose the most in 16 months
after Japan’s biggest paint maker,  Kansai Paint Co. , offered to
buy shares in the group that it doesn’t already own for 12 rand
each, valuing the company at 2.45 billion rand ($360 million).  Freeworld climbed as much as 1.25 rand, or 12 percent, the
biggest advance since Aug. 6, 2009, to 11.50 rand. Shares in the
company were 11 percent higher at 11.40 rand at the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg.  Kansai, which owns 27.6 percent of Freeworld, made the
offer in a letter delivered to the board, the Osaka-based
company said in a statement today distributed by Johannesburg’s
stock exchange. The offer price is 17 percent above Freeworld’s
price of 10.25 rand on Dec. 10, it said.  The transaction would allow Kansai to “expand into other
countries in sub-Saharan Africa,” Nauman Malik, the company’s
head of corporate strategy, said by phone from Johannesburg.
Freeworld’s board said in November a takeover by its Japanese
rival could raise antitrust concerns and brought the matter
before South Africa’s Competition Commission.  Kansai doesn’t expect any antitrust concerns to be
‘insurmountable,” Malik said. Two-thirds of Freeworld’s
business is in decorative painting, a segment which it isn’t in,
he said. “We believe we can come to a resolution,” Malik said.  Kansai has received undertakings from fund managers
representing about 42.3 percent of Freeworld’s shares, including
the Public Investment Corp., Africa’s largest pension fund
manager, to accept the offer, it said in a statement.  Freeworld shareholders in June rejected a 10.45 rand a
share offer led by a group of private-equity funds controlled by
Brait SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
