The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Tevez Wants Out  Carlos Tevez  will quit soccer if Manchester City doesn’t
grant him a transfer next month,  the Sun  reported.  The 26-year-old striker misses his two children, who live
with his estranged wife in Argentina, the Sun said.  Tevez, who could persuade his family to move to Spain,
first sought to quit City in August, the newspaper said. At the
time, he rejected a 1.5 million pound ($2.4 million) bonus to
stay, saying money wasn’t the issue, the Sun added.  Speed to Wales  Gary Speed  has agreed to coach Wales, four months after
starting as Sheffield United manager,  the Daily Mail  reported.  The 41-year-old’s appointment will be made public today
after United -- 20th of 24 teams in the Championship -- agreed
compensation with Welsh soccer officials, the Mail said.  Grant’s Hopes  West Ham coach  Avram Grant  wants the club to spend 10
million pounds on up to three players in the January transfer
window, the  Daily Mail  reported.  The Hammers are in last place, five points off the safety
of 17th place, after losing 3-1 to Manchester City two days ago,
the Mail said.  Drogba Return?  Marseille coach  Didier Deschamps  said “maybe one day”
 Didier Drogba  will return after he failed to sign the Chelsea
striker in the offseason, the  Daily Mail  reported. Drogba left
Marseille for Chelsea in 2004.  Deschamps also hopes to beat Liverpool to the signing of
Rennes right-back Rod Fanni next month, the Mail added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
