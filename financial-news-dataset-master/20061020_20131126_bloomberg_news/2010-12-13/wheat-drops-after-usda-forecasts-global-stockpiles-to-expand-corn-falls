Soybeans and corn rose in Chicago
after China refrained from raising interest rates and amid
increasing optimism that the U.S. economic recovery is
gathering steam, lifting demand for commodities.  Soybeans for January delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent
to $12.89 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$12.8325 at 12:08 p.m. Paris time. The oilseed lost 2.1 percent
last week, after gaining 8.2 percent the previous two weeks.  China won’t raise rates because that would lead to fund
inflows from overseas and exacerbate inflation, said  He Zhen ,
who helps manage $301 million as general manager at Shanghai
Huili Asset Management.  Chinese soybean imports jumped 47 percent to 5.48 million
metric tons in November, the first gain in five months,
according to Bloomberg News calculations based on  data  posted
on the website of the General Administration of Customs on Dec.
10. China that day ordered banks to set aside larger
reserves and didn’t announce an interest-rate rise. Data
released the next day showed inflation reached 5.1 percent in
November while industrial-output growth and retail sales grew.  Corn for March delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent to
$5.79 a bushel in Chicago before trading at $5.785.  Wheat for March delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent to
$7.8125 a bushel, reversing a drop of as much as 1.2 percent,
before trading at $7.8075 a bushel. The grain declined 0.5
percent last week, the first drop in three weeks.  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris slipped 0.3 percent to 241.25 euros a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
