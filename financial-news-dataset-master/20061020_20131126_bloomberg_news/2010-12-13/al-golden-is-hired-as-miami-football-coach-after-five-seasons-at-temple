Al Golden  was hired as head football
coach at the  University of Miami  after leading Temple University
in Philadelphia to back-to-back winning seasons for the first
time in 30 years.  Golden, 41, succeeds  Randy Shannon , who was fired Nov. 27
after a 7-5 season.  Golden has spent the past five seasons at  Temple  and led
the Owls to 17 wins the past two years. Temple had a 0-11 record
in 2005, the season before Golden took over the program.  “His desire, leadership, communications skills and
preparedness stood above the rest and he is the right man to
meet the championship expectations of this program,” Miami
Athletic Director  Kirby Hocutt  said in a  statement .  Temple had an 8-4 record under Golden this season and beat
Big East Conference champion Connecticut. The Owls went 9-4 last
season and reached their first bowl game since 1979.  Golden, who had an overall 27-34 record at Temple, takes
control of a Miami program that won the last of its five
national championships in 2001. The Hurricanes’ last two coaches
-- Shannon and  Larry Coker  -- were promoted from coordinator
jobs and the Miami Herald said some trustees were wary of again
following that route.  Shannon, 44, was fired after the Hurricanes lost to the
University of South Florida to finish the regular season.
Offensive line coach  Jeff Stoutland  will coach the team when
Miami plays Notre Dame in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31.  Shannon was 0-2 in bowl games at Miami. A member of the
Hurricanes’ 1987 national championship team, Shannon’s .560
winning percentage was the worst by any Miami coach since Lou
Saban went 9-13 in 1977-78.  From 1979 through 2006, Miami’s football team won five
championships and had a 267-69 record.  Howard Schnellenberger coached the school to its first
title in 1983,  Jimmy Johnson  won the second in 1987 and  Dennis Erickson  won championships in 1989 and 1991. The Hurricanes’
most recent title came in the first season under Coker, who had
succeeded Butch Davis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
