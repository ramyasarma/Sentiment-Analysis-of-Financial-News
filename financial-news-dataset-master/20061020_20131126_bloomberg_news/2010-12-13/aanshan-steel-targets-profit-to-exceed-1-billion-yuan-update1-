Maanshan Iron & Steel Co. (323) ,  China ’s
second-biggest Hong Kong-traded steelmaker, forecast net profit
for 2011 will exceed 1 billion yuan.  The target was announced in a statement posted on parent
Magang (Group) Holding Co.’s  website  today. Maanshan may post
net income of 2.2 billion yuan next year, according to the mean
estimate of 23 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “The statement suggests Maanshan’s profit probably won’t
exceed 2 billion yuan,” said  Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based
analyst with UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. “The profit will rise, but is
unlikely to return to 2007 levels.”  China has stepped up measures to rein in property
speculation, trimming steel demand and making it hard for
steelmakers to pass on higher raw material costs. Coking coal
prices may double next year from 2007 levels and iron ore prices
may rise 20 percent, Lau estimated.  Maanshan may boost its earnings almost fourfold to 1.54
billion yuan this year, according to a Bloomberg survey, from
392 million yuan in 2009. It had a profit of 2.47 billion yuan
in 2007.  --Helen Yuan. Editors: Alan Soughley, Indranil Ghosh  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
