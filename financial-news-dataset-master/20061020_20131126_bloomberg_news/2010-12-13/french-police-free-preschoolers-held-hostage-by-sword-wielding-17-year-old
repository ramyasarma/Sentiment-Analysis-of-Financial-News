A French teenager who held 20
nursery school children and their teacher hostage in Besancon,
eastern France, for more than four hours today is now in police
custody, the interior ministry said.  Local police SWAT teams “succeeded in bringing to a close,
very quickly and without casualties, the detention of 20
children, their teacher and a teacher’s aide,” the ministry
said in an e-mailed statement.  The 17-year-old-boy, who was “depressed and suicidal,”
according to  BFM TV , walked into the Charles-Fourier nursery
school at 8:30 a.m. local time, armed with two 30 centimeter-
(12 inches) long swords.  He released eight of the children, aged between four and
six years old, at about 9:45 a.m. and others during the morning.
He also asked police for a “weapon to commit suicide,”
according to national radio station  France Info .  After negotiations with police officers, the last five
children and their teacher were released shortly before 1:00
p.m. and are now receiving counseling and psychiatric
evaluation, BFM TV reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
