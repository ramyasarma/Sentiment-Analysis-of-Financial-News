Crude rose in New York as China held
off raising interest rates, boosting speculation that oil demand
will continue to grow in the world’s largest energy user.  China refrained from increasing borrowing costs after a
report on Dec. 11 that  inflation  in the country climbed 5.1
percent, easing concern the economy may slow and limit fuel
usage. The International Energy Agency on Dec. 10 raised its
demand outlook for 2011 on increases in North America and Asia.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries maintained
production quotas at a Dec. 11 in Quito.  “China’s delaying of an interest rate increase has added
to the other more positive fundamental factors,” said  Yingxi Yu ,
a commodity analyst with Barclays Capital in Singapore. “We’re
seeing draws in inventories and that’s a clear sign demand is
outpacing supply.”  The January contract rose as much as 67 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $88.46 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $88.43 at 3:35 p.m.
Singapore time. It earlier dropped as much as 0.4 percent to
$87.44 a barrel.  The contract closed Dec. 10 at $87.79, the lowest in seven
days, capping the first weekly decline in three.  Prices also gained after China Mainland Marketing Research
Co. said the nation’s refiners increased  crude processing  10.3
percent to a record 36.65 million metric tons in November, or
8.96 million barrels a day. That exceeded the record of 8.76
million barrels a day in October.  China Shipments  China increased net imports of crude by 26 percent in
November from a month earlier as refineries ramped up processing
rates to ease a diesel shortage. Net purchases were 20.3 million
metric tons, or 5 million barrels a day, the highest since
September’s record 22.9 million tons, data from the Beijing-
based General Administration of Customs showed.  Oil inventories in the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development in November dropped by 8.4 million barrels, the
IEA said in its Oil Market Report, citing preliminary data.  The Paris-based adviser raised its 2011 demand forecast by
260,000 barrels to an average of 88.8 million barrels a day, the
third month it has increased its outlook.  Brent crude oil for January settlement climbed as much as
91 cents, or 1 percent, to $91.39 a barrel. The contract on Dec.
10 fell 51 cents, or 0.6 percent, to end the session at $90.48 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Long Positions  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
their net-long position in crude-oil futures and options in the
week ended Dec. 7, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Managed-money bets that prices will rise outnumbered short
positions by 206,807 futures, the Washington-based regulator
said in its weekly Commitments of Traders report. Net long
positions rose by 42,603 contracts, or 25.95 percent, from a
week earlier.  Producers and merchants increased so-called net-short
positions by 13 percent in the week ended Dec. 7, according to
the CFTC report. Sales increased for the first time in four
weeks as producers secured profits near $90 a barrel, reversing
a two-year contango and raising speculation that stockpiles will
decline.  OPEC maintained its output quotas, forecasting demand
growth will slow as the global economy struggles to recover amid
ample supplies.  Oil supply and demand are “in balance,” and $70 to $80 is
“a good price” for oil, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al- Naimi  said at the group’s meeting in Quito, Ecuador, on Dec. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
