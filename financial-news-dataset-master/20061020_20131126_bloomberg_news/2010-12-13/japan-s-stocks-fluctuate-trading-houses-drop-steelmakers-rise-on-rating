Japanese  stocks  rose, sending the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to its highest close since May, as U.S.
consumer confidence boosted the outlook for the global economic
recovery and China refrained from raising interest rates.  Nippon Steel Corp. , Japan’s largest maker of the alloy,
climbed 2.7 percent after JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased its
investment recommendation to “overweight.” Honda Motor Co.,
Japan’s second-biggest carmaker by sales that gets 44 percent of
its revenue from North America, gained 1.1 percent. TDK Corp.,
an electronics maker that derives more than 30 percent of its
sales in China, advanced 2.8 percent.  “People were worried about the reaction in Asia to China’s
increased reserve ratio, but it seems that didn’t spark concern,
so a sense of ease is increasing,” said  Hideyuki Ookoshi ,
general manager in Tokyo at Chuo Securities Co. “If the U.S.
economy stabilizes, the trend to buy the dollar will continue
and that is positive for Japanese stocks.”  The Nikkei 225 increased 0.8 percent to 10,293.89 in Tokyo,
the highest close since May 14. The broader  Topix  index rose 1
percent to 897.40, with more than six stocks advancing for each
that fell. All 33 industry groups in the gauge rose.  Shares also gained as the yen weakened, improving the
earnings prospects for exporters, and on speculation Japan will
extend a capital-gains tax break by a year.  The Topix has lost 1.1 percent in 2010, compared with gains
of 11 percent by the S&P 500 and 8.8 percent by the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at 15.6
times estimated  earnings  on average, compared with 14.5 times
for the S&P 500 and 12.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Machinery Makers Gain  Nippon Steel rose 2.7 percent to 301 yen and  JFE Holdings
Inc. , Japan’s second-biggest steelmaker, climbed 3.3 percent to
2,854 yen after the companies had their ratings increased to
“overweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Machinery makers advanced after Credit Suisse AG raised its
view on Japanese factory automation-related companies to bullish
from bearish, saying orders for machine tools will likely
increase.  SMC Corp. , a maker of directional-control devices,
rallied 2.4 percent to 14,250 yen, the highest close since
November 2007. THK Co., which makes industrial machinery, leapt
5.6 percent to 1,912 yen. Nabtesco Corp., a maker of hydraulic
equipment, jumped 5.9 percent to 1,690 yen, a level not seen
since January 2008.  U.S. Consumer Sentiment  Honda Motor increased 1.1 percent to 3,175 yen. Toyota
Motor Corp., the largest carmaker worldwide, gained 0.6 percent
to 3,250 yen.  Toshiba Corp. , a maker of electronics and power
equipment that gets more than half of its revenue abroad,
climbed 1.9 percent to 440 yen.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S.  consumer sentiment  rose to 74.2 in December from
71.6 at the end of November. Economists projected a December
reading of 72.5, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  “The U.S. economy is better than I thought and excessive
pessimism about the economy is receding,” said  Kiyoshi Noda , a
chief fund manager at Tokyo-based MU Investment Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $14 billion in Tokyo.  The yen depreciated to 84.17 against the dollar, compared
with 83.67 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo on Dec. 10. A
weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  China’s Inflation  TDK advanced 2.8 percent to 5,900 yen, the highest since
May 18.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. , which is the world’s
biggest maker of giant excavators and gets more than one-fourth
of its sales in China, increased 1 percent to 1,992 yen. Komatsu
Ltd., a maker of earth movers that gets about 20 percent of its
sales in China, rose 1.4 percent to 2,462 yen.  China refrained at the weekend from raising interest rates
to combat inflation and instead ordered banks to increase
reserves at the central bank for the third time in five weeks.
Reserve requirements will increase 50 basis points starting Dec.
20, the People’s Bank of China said on its website on Dec. 10.  Consumer prices in China rose a more-than-forecast 5.1
percent in November from a year earlier, the fastest pace in 28
months, a statistics bureau report showed in Beijing on Dec. 11.
Producer-price inflation was 6.1 percent, higher than the
estimates of any of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Stocks extended gains after two Japanese government
officials said Japan may extend a capital-gains tax break by a
year after the Financial Services Agency opposed ending it in
2011 as scheduled.  Brokerages Advance  Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s  largest brokerage , jumped 2.8
percent to 519 yen while Daiwa Securities Group Inc., the
second-biggest, leapt 4 percent to 415 yen, a level not seen
since May 18. An index group that includes the companies had the
 largest increase  in the Topix.  Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., the nation’s biggest
telecommunications company, declined 1.1 percent to 3,785 yen
and was the  heaviest drag  on the Topix. The Japanese government
may request the company to halve fiber-optic fees by 2015 in a
bid to provide ultra-fast communications networks to all
households in the country, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter for this story:
