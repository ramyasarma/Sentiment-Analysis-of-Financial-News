Harley-Davidson Inc. , the largest
U.S. motorcycle maker, said it has bought back senior unsecured
notes with a face value of $297 million that were scheduled to
mature Feb. 1, 2014.  The purchase will lower fourth-quarter pretax profit by
about $82.7 million, Milwaukee-based Harley said in a statement
sent by PRNewswire.  Harley said it repurchased the notes Dec. 10 for
$380.8 million from Davis Selected Advisers LP using cash on
hand. Had the company held the notes until they matured, it
would have cost $438 million more in principal and interest.  Harley rose 18 cents to $33.69 Dec. 10. The shares rose
34 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
