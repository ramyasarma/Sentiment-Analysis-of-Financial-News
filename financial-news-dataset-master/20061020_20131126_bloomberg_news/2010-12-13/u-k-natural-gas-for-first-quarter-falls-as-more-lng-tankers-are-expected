U.K. natural gas for delivery next
quarter declined as more liquefied gas carriers headed to the
U.K. and Belgium. Power for delivery tomorrow rose on forecast
increased demand.  The port of Milford Haven in south Wales will receive two
additional LNG deliveries this month, according to its  website .
Belgium’s Zeebrugge terminal, linked to the U.K. by pipeline,
will also get a shipment, AISLive shipping data show.  Gas for the first quarter slipped 1.7 pence, or 2.9
percent, to 57 pence a therm as of 4:30 p.m. in London. That’s
equal to $9.05 a million British thermal units. A therm is
100,000 Btu.  The Al Samriya LNG tanker will dock at the South Hook
terminal on Dec. 18 from Qatar. The Bluesky will arrive at BG
Group Plc’s neighboring terminal two days later while the Grace
Acacia LNG tanker is due at Zeebrugge on Dec. 28. That brings
the total number of ships due in the two countries to 11.  Gas for immediate delivery gained 1.2 percent to 61 pence a
therm as  long-term storage levels  declined to 25,291 gigawatt-
hours, 31 percent less than at the same time last year.  “Given the low levels of storage as well as the forecasted
return of extremely cold temperature from the middle of this
week through the new year, we would expect there to be further
upside to prompt prices,” Barclays Capital said today in an e-
mailed report.  Temperatures in London may fall as low as minus 8 degrees
Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) on Dec. 19, from a minimum of
zero today, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  U.K. baseload power for tomorrow rose 50 pence, or 0.9
percent, to 56.5 pounds a megawatt-hour as of 4:30 p.m. in
London according to broker data on Bloomberg.  National Grid Plc forecast electricity consumption may peak
today at 58,444 megawatts today, 12 percent higher than
yesterday, as factories and businesses return after the weekend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
