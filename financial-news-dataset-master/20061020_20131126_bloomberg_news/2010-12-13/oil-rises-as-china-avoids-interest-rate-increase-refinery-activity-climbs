Crude oil rose the most in a week
after China left interest rates unchanged and a report showed
the country’s refineries ran at record levels last month,
signaling demand will climb in the world’s biggest energy user.  Futures gained 0.9 percent as China increased reserve
requirements for the country’s banks for the third time in five
weeks, avoiding a rate increase. China’s refiners boosted  crude
processing  to a record in November, according to the China
Mainland Marketing Research Co., which compiles data for the
National Bureau of Statistics.  “There was the potential that China would raise interest
rates last weekend, and the market took off because that didn’t
happen,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc. in New York. “Chinese refiners also increased
processing rates to a record. This market wants to continue to
climb.”  Crude oil for January delivery increased 82 cents to settle
at $88.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
are up 27 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for January settlement climbed 71 cents, or
0.8 percent, to end the session at $91.19 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Refineries in China, which last year overtook the U.S. as
the world’s biggest energy-consuming country, processed 36.65
million metric tons of crude oil in November, or 8.96 million
barrels a day.  Chinese Imports  Chinese net imports of crude jumped 26 percent in November
from a month earlier, the Beijing-based General Administration
of Customs said. Net purchases were 20.3 million metric tons, or
5 million barrels a day, the highest level since September’s
record 22.9 million tons.  “The market moved sharply higher on Chinese headlines
earlier,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “Both record refinery crude runs and
the lack of an interest rate boost pushed prices higher.”  China’s interest-rate decision sent the dollar lower
against 15 of its 16 major counterparts. A weaker U.S. currency
increases the appeal of commodities to investors. The dollar
declined 1.3 percent against the euro to $1.3399 at 3:02 p.m. in
New York from $1.3226 on Dec. 10.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.3 percent to
1,243.92 at 3:17 p.m. in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  climbed 0.4 percent to 11,458.30.  “Oil is up because equities are higher and the dollar is
down,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors
in Houston. “This has been the general relationship for quite a
while, not the fundamentals.”  OPEC Targets  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries kept its
output quota unchanged at a Dec. 11 meeting in Quito, Ecuador.
OPEC has maintained a target of 24.845 million barrels a day
since December 2008, the longest period without a change since
it was first used in 1982.  Oil supply and demand are “in balance,” and $70 to $80 is
“a good price,” Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said
at the group’s meeting.  Global oil demand has exceeded supply by more than 900,000
barrels a day on a seasonally adjusted basis since May, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said in an e-mailed report today. Goldman
expects the world oil market to remain in deficit in the first
half of next year, it said. Crude will average $100 a barrel in
2011 and $110 a barrel in 2012, according to Goldman estimates.  CFTC Report  Oil producers increased sales for the first time in four
weeks to lock in gains near $90 a barrel, reversing a two-year
contango and raising speculation that stockpiles will decline.  Producers and merchants  increased so-called net-short
positions in crude futures and options by 13 percent in the week
ended Dec. 7, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s said in
its Commitments of Traders report. It was the second-largest set
of sales in two years.  Hedging oil for future delivery pressured the longest-
maturity contracts, erasing the contango, or premium paid for
later shipments. Hedge funds exaggerated the move as oil for
delivery in December 2011 began trading at a premium to December
2012 for the first time since the week Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. declared bankruptcy in September 2008.  “This rally is vulnerable,” said  Richard Soultanian , co-
president of NUS Consulting Group, a Park Ridge, New Jersey-
based energy procurement adviser. “The fundamentals today don’t
justify the run-up in prices. Once it runs out of steam, there
will be nothing to hold it up.”  Oil volume on the Nymex was 573,150 contracts as of 3:03
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 589,210
contracts on Dec. 10, 16 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.36 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
