Pfizer  Inc., the world’s biggest
drugmaker, will raise its quarterly dividend 2 cents to 20 cents
a share, after cutting the payout to help fund its $68 billion
Wyeth acquisition.  The estimate fell short of the Bloomberg dividend forecast
of  21 cents . Pfizer, based in New York, also named  George Lorch 
board chairman, replacing  Jeffrey Kindler , who resigned from his
positions as chairman and chief executive officer on Dec. 5,
according to a company statement.  Pfizer reduced its dividend in half to 16 cents in May 2009
to help pay for its Wyeth purchase. Pfizer raised its dividend
last December to 18 cents a share. The dividend may rise by
about 10 percent a year through 2013,  Barbara Ryan , an analyst
with Deutsche Bank in New York, said in a Dec. 7 report.  Lorch, 68, has been a Pfizer director since 2000 and is
former chairman and CEO of Armstrong Holdings Inc., a company
that manufactured wood floors, cabinets, insulation and
ceilings. He resigned from his positions as chair of the
compensation committee and member of the science and technology
committee in order to take on his new role, Pfizer said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
