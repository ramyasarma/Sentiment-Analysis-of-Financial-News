Algeria is withholding 100 billion
yen ($1.2 billion) in payments owed to Japanese contractors,
including Kajima Corp., for a highway construction project in
the northern African country, the Asahi newspaper said.  Algeria refused to pay the money on grounds that the
companies had failed to meet the terms of the contract, the
newspaper reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with
the situation.   Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci, after meeting
with his Japanese counterpart, Seiji Maehara, told the newspaper
in an interview that he believes that the problem will be solved
quickly, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
