Kansai Paint Co. , Japan’s biggest
paint maker, offered to buy the shares it doesn’t already own in
 Freeworld Coatings Ltd.  in a deal that values the South African
company at 2.45 billion rand ($357 million).  Kansai, which owns 27.6 percent of Freeworld, offered 12
rand a share in a letter delivered to the board today, the
Osaka-based company said in a statement distributed by
Johannesburg’s stock exchange. The offer price is 17 percent
higher than Freeworld’s last trade at 10.25 rand.  Kansai is seeking acquisitions to support growth, President
 Yuzo Kawamori  said last month. Freeworld said in November a
takeover by its Japanese rival could raise antitrust concerns
and brought the matter before South Africa’s Competition
Commission.  Freeworld shareholders in June rejected a 10.45 rand a
share offer led by a group of private-equity funds controlled by
Brait SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
