South Africa’s government will back
a request by farmers for preferential access to European markets
for its sugar exports, Business Day said, citing Department of
Trade and Industry spokesman, Charles Mnisi.  The free-trade agreement between South Africa and the
European Union, which has been in force since 2001 and which
excludes sugar, is under review, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper quoted Mnisi as saying. The country’s government is
waiting for a response to its request, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
