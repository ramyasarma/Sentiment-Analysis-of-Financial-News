Rising  profits  and cash balances
will push the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  to the biggest three-
year advance since the 1990s, surpassing forecasts for below-
average returns, strategists at Wall Street’s biggest banks say.  The benchmark gauge for American equities will rise 11
percent from last week’s close to 1,379 in 2011, bringing the
increase since 2008 to 53 percent, the best return since 1997 to
2000, according to the average of 11 strategists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s  David Kostin , the most
accurate U.S. strategist this year, said sales growth will spur
a 17 percent rally in the S&P 500 through the end of 2011.  Market analysts say earnings will hit record highs, keeping
 valuations  below historical averages at the same time government
spending aids the economy. Reaching their average forecast for
2011 would give the index annualized gains of 15 percent over
three years, twice the rate anticipated by Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s new normal theory that anticipates deficits and
increased regulation will limit returns.  “Your new normal may not be quite so new,” said  Barry Knapp , the New York-based head of equity strategy for Barclays
Plc, who expects the S&P 500 will reach 1,420. “There’s nothing
to worry about with earnings. We’ll get some margin expansion,
and we’re still at a pretty good stage in the economic cycle.
From my perspective, I’ve tried to think about all the risks. I
just think the outlook is favorable, so favorable that I
struggle to see how the equity market doesn’t perform well.”  Tax Breaks  Stocks rose last week, pushing the S&P 500 up 1.3 percent
to an almost 27-month high of 1,240.40, after President  Barack Obama  said he would agree to a two-year extension of tax cuts
enacted under his predecessor,  George W. Bush . The index has
gained 11 percent this year.  The S&P 500 erased gains in the final hour of trading
today, advancing 0.06 point, or less than 0.1 percent, to
1,240.46 at 4 p.m. New York time.  A Dec. 10 report showed U.S. consumer confidence jumped to
a six-month high and the trade deficit narrowed more than
economists estimated as exports rose to the highest level since
2008.  “Company balance sheets have never been stronger,” said
Kostin, citing Goldman Sachs data showing companies hold more
than $1 trillion in cash, the most ever compared with the value
of their assets. “We expect  S&P 500 firms  will increase
spending in all categories, with the fastest growth in
acquisitions and share repurchases.”  Hiring Slump  Equities climbed on Dec. 9 when  Mohamed El-Erian , the chief
executive officer and co-chief investment officer of Pimco,
raised his forecast for next year’s U.S. growth as policy makers
spend up to $600 billion to buy Treasuries through so-called
quantitative easing. Pimco said the economy may grow 3.5 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the year-earlier period, up
from 2.5 percent.  Pimco, manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, said since
May 2009 that gains in financial assets would be below
historical averages for years to come.  Bill Gross , the other co-
chief investment officer, said on Dec. 3 that a Labor Department
report showing hiring trailed forecasts in November shows gross
domestic product isn’t expanding fast enough to sustain market
rallies.  ‘Stable Wings’  “The old normal was 6 to 7 percent,” Gross said in a Dec.
3 radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .
“The new normal is a 3 percent plus or minus nominal GDP. It
speaks to 2 percent growth and 1 percent inflation. We are
running at a half-size-paper-airplane type of economy as opposed
to one with stable wings and full thrusting jet engines.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in an
interview broadcast Dec. 5 by CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes” program
that the economy is barely expanding at a sustainable pace and
that he may increase bond purchases. China, the world’s fastest-
growing major economy, said this month it’s moving to a more
“prudent” monetary policy to counter inflation.  Kostin, Goldman Sachs’ New York-based strategist who said
last year the S&P 500 would end 2010 at 1,250, wrote in a note
Dec. 6 that below-average bond yields help create a “superb
backdrop” for equities. He expects the S&P 500 to finish 2011
at 1,450, the second most-bullish call among 11 firms surveyed.
Total per-share earnings among companies in the index may rise
to $94 next year, he said.  The profit forecast would be a record and compares with an
average prediction of $92 a share in the Bloomberg News survey
of strategists. The index trades at 13.5 times that estimate,
compared with a median price-earnings ratio of 16.4 since 1956,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher Yield  The S&P 500’s earnings yield, or annual profit divided by
share price, was 6.45 percent at the end of last week, according
to Bloomberg data. That was 3.13 percentage points more than
payouts on 10-year Treasuries and about 2.4 points more than the
average interest on U.S. corporate bonds as measured by Barclays
Plc. The spread between S&P 500 earnings and corporate bond
yields is close to the highest level in more than two decades.  That suggests stocks are cheap relative to bonds and may
spur investments by individuals, institutions and companies in
2011, Kostin said.  More than 70 percent of companies  exceeded  analysts’ profit
estimates in the third quarter. That was the sixth straight
period that many beat projections, the longest stretch since at
least 1993, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Chance of Great’  Jonathan Golub  at UBS AG in New York expects a 6.8 percent
rise to 1,325 in the S&P 500 through 2011, fueled by sales
growth of as much as 7 percent. Next year looks “good, with a
chance of great” for equities, he said in an interview. “You
really get to good based on earnings alone. We’re entering into
a self-sustained recovery,” and there’s “a very accommodative
backdrop being provided by the Fed,” he said.  Record cash means companies can increase mergers,
acquisitions and share repurchases, Golub said. Buybacks will
amount to $375 billion by the end of this year, the fourth-
largest annual total since at least 1985, should they continue
at the current rate, according to Birinyi Associates Inc.  Hewlett-Packard Co., which has $10.9 billion in  cash  and
equivalents, plans to repurchase shares, Chief Financial Officer
 Cathie Lesjak  said Dec. 8 at an investor conference in San
Francisco. The Palo Alto, California-based personal-computer
maker added $10 billion in August to $4.9 billion already
available for buybacks.  Shares for Takeover  Schlumberger Ltd. , the largest oilfield services provider,
is considering buying back some of the 176 million shares issued
this year after an acquisition, Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Gould  said on an Oct. 22 conference call.  Golub said earnings valuations based on profit estimates
for 2011 are the best way to judge value, and they show prices
have been depressed by an overly pessimistic view of the
economy. UBS’s forecast for the  S&P 500  in 2010 a year ago
matched Goldman Sachs’ at 1,250.  “Is the market discounting weaker growth rates? You have a
multiple that’s so substantially below normal it would appear
that that’s the case,” Golub said. “But as the economy
continues to surprise on the upside, there’s a process by which
the market starts to discount greater success. I’m not calling
for a lower-return year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
