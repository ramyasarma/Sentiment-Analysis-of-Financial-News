Weber-Stephen Products Co., the
closely held maker of Weber charcoal and gas grills, said
investment firm BDT Capital Partners LLC will acquire a majority
stake in the company.  Terms weren’t disclosed. Bank of America Corp. was Weber’s
financial adviser, and the transaction is expected to close in
December, Palatine, Illinois-based Weber said in a statement
today. The Stephen family, which has owned the company since it
was founded by George Stephen in 1952, will retain the four
Weber-branded restaurants and work with BDT as a minority
investor in the grill maker.  BDT Capital, based in Chicago, is backed by  Byron Trott , a
former banker at Goldman Sachs. Trott facilitated  Warren Buffett ’s $4.5 billion acquisition of Marmon Holdings Inc., a
holding company with manufacturing and servicing businesses, in
2008 and the $1.45 billion takeover of consumer products
distributor McLane Co. in 2003. BDT Capital oversees a $2
billion fund, according to the statement.  “This investment is a perfect example of our business
model -- to partner and invest alongside best-in-class and
enduring family businesses with strong management teams and
loyal customers,” Trott said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
