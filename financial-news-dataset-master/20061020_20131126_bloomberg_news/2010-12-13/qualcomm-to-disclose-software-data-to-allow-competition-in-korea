Qualcomm Inc. , the largest maker of
chips that run mobile phones, will start disclosing information
that will allow South Korean companies to develop software for
its chips, the country’s antitrust regulator said.  Qualcomm will disclose the information in the next 2 to 10
months, Korea’s  Fair Trade Commission  said in a statement today.
The company made customers buy its software by keeping the data
exclusive, the Korean regulator said. Kim Seung Soo, a Seoul-
based Qualcomm spokesman, declined to comment.  The commission fined Qualcomm a record 270 billion won
($236 million) last year for discriminatory acts that included
charging higher royalties to some customers, according to the
statement.  Keeping the mobile-chip software information exclusive was
part of the probe that led to the fine and the company was put
under further review because of the complexity of the matter,
the commission said. Qualcomm volunteered to make the
information available during the investigation, the Korean
regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
