The possibility of Electricte de
France SA raising its stake in  Areva SA  may not be the best
idea,  Les Echos  reported, citing an interview with French
Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.  EDF and Areva are in talks on a strategic partnership and
any move for the nuclear reactor utility to increase its holding
in Areva needs to fit in with their industrial strategy, Lagarde
was quoted as saying.  A shareholders’ pact between the government and Kuwait as
part of Areva’s capital increase allows the oil emirate to sell
its stake to the state if Areva shares aren’t listed by June 30,
the newspaper reported, citing the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
