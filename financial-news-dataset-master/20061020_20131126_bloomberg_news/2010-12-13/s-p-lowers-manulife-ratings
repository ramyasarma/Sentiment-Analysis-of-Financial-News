Manulife Financial Corp. , the
Canadian insurer that owns Boston-based John Hancock Financial,
had credit ratings cut by Standard & Poor’s on concern that U.S.
earnings “will be weaker than historical levels.”  The long-term counterparty credit rating was lowered to A-
from A, S&P said today in a statement. Ratings on Manulife
insurance subsidiaries including the Manufacturers Life
Insurance Co. and John Hancock Life Insurance Co. fell to AA-
from AA. Manulife halved its  dividend  last year and has missed
the analyst profit estimates in 8 of the last 11 quarters.  “The prospective earnings profile of the U.S. operations
will be weaker than historical levels given the current economic
environment,” S&P said in the report. “The firm’s equity and
interest rate risk, while declining, still remains high relative
to its peers.”  Manulife fell 10 cents to C$16.79 at 4:06 p.m. in composite
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It has fallen 13 percent
this year, compared with the 9.5 percent gain by the  S&P/TSX 60 
index of Canada’s largest and most heavily traded companies.  Laurie Lupton , a spokeswoman for Toronto-based Manulife,
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
