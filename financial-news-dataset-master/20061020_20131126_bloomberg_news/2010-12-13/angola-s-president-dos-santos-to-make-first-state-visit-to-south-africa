Angolan President  Jose Eduardo Dos Santos  will visit South Africa this week, in the first official
trip by a head of state since apartheid ended in 1994, as the
countries pledge stronger trade and political ties.  Dos Santos will be accompanied by Cabinet ministers and
business executives during his three-day visit starting today,
Clayson Monyela, a spokesman for South Africa’s Department of
International Relations and Cooperation, said in a phone
interview from Washington.  South African President  Jacob Zuma  has strengthened links
with Angola, Africa’s second-biggest oil producer, visiting the
country in his first official trip as head of state in August
last year. Angola, which is rebuilding its economy after three
decades of civil war ended in 2002, will next year take over as
head of the Southern African Development Community, a 15-nation
regional bloc.  “Angola is a strategic partner,” Monyela said. “There
are political agreements to be signed and we are also looking at
how the two countries can expand on trade relations.”  Oil accounts for about 90 percent of Angola’s 12 billion
rand ($1.8 billion) in exports to South Africa, according to the
ministry.  Zuma signed six cooperation agreements with Dos Santos in
Angola last year, covering areas including trade and air
services. During the visit, Dos Santos announced plans for
state-run energy companies Sonangol SA and PetroSA Ltd. to
cooperate on refining oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
