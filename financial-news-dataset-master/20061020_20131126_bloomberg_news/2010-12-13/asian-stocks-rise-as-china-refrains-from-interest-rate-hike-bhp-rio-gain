Asian  stocks  rose as raw-material
producers gained after China refrained from raising interest
rates to cool inflation, while Australia’s biggest banks
advanced on speculation they will benefit from increased
competition.  Cnooc Ltd. , China’s biggest offshore oil producer, climbed
1.4 percent in Hong Kong as crude oil futures rose. Rio Tinto
Group, the world’s third-largest miner, gained 0.5 percent after
copper futures climbed to a record.  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , the nation’s No. 1 lender by market value, advanced
1.2 percent after Treasure  Wayne Swan  proposed to bolster credit
unions to spur competition in banking.  Samsung Electronics Co. ,
the world’s No. 1 maker of televisions and flat screens, climbed
1.2 percent in Seoul after U.S. consumer confidence increased.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.5 percent to 133.72 as
of 7:21 p.m. in Tokyo, with about seven stocks gaining for every
three that declined. The gauge dropped 0.3 percent last week as
concern grew that China’s central bank would raise interest
rates. The bank instead increased lenders’ reserve ratio
requirements.  “The government seems to be using reserve requirements at
the moment as a more effective tool,”  Hugh Simon , co-manager of
the Dreyfus Greater China Fund, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. “They need to have some relief about inflation. The
market is not expensive.”  Regional Benchmarks  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  climbed 0.8 percent, and
Taiwan’s  Taiex Index  increased 0.2 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.2 percent. China’s  Shanghai Composite Index 
rose 2.9 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 0.7
percent.  While China’s inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in
28 months in November, building the case for Premier  Wen Jiabao 
to raise interest rates, China instead ordered lenders to park
more money with the central bank to counter the inflation threat.  The central bank’s lack of action “is fairly positive
news,”  He Zhen , who helps manage $301 million as general
manager at Shanghai Huili Asset Management, said in an interview
on Dec. 11. “The central bank will be very cautious about
raising interest rates.”  Raw material producers gained after crude oil rebounded and
the price of copper reached a record high.  Cnooc gained 1.4 percent to HK$18.34 in Hong Kong. Jiangxi
Copper climbed 3.3 percent to HK$25.10. Rio, which receives
about 24 percent of its revenue from China, gained 0.5 percent
to A$87.77.  Copper, Crude Oil  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 1.8 percent to $9,150 a metric ton. It
breached the previous record of $9,091, which was set on Dec. 9.
Crude oil for January delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent to
$88.56 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Nippon Steel Corp. jumped 2.7 percent to 301 yen in Tokyo,
while JFE Holdings Inc. gained 3.3 percent to 2,854 yen. Both
steelmakers had their stock ratings raised to “overweight”
from “neutral” by JPMorgan.  China’s consumer prices rose a more-than-forecast 5.1
percent in November from a year earlier, a statistics bureau
report showed in Beijing on Dec. 11. Producer-price inflation
was 6.1 percent, higher than any of 28 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News had estimated. Banks’ reserve requirements will
increase 50 basis points starting Dec. 20, the People’s Bank of
China said on its website on Dec. 10.  Consumer Confidence  China’s decision to refrain from increasing interest rates
will benefit stocks, Shanghai Huili’s He Zhen said. China’s
“large” banks will be the “major beneficiary” of tighter
liquidity and higher interest rates this year and in 2011,
Deutsche Bank AG said.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. In New York, the index gained 0.6 percent to
1,240.40 on Dec. 10 after General Electric Co. boosted its
dividend, and reports on consumer confidence and the trade
deficit beat forecasts.  Confidence among U.S. consumers increased more than
forecast in December to the highest level in six months at the
same time Americans began stepping up holiday spending. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment rose to 74.2 from 71.6 at the end of November.
Economists projected a December reading of 72.5, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Australian Banks  Samsung, which gets about 22 percent of sales from America,
climbed 1.2 percent to 930,000 won. Techtronic Industries Co.,
maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners and Ryobi power tools, gained
3.1 percent to HK$9.90. Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., the
world’s biggest maker of athletic shoes, increased 3.4 percent
to HK$28.80.  A  gauge  of finance companies posted the second-biggest
advance among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index. Australia’s biggest lenders increased on speculation they
will emerge as winners from Treasurer  Wayne Swan ’s measures to
promote banking competition.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia increased 1.2 percent to
A$51.20.  Westpac Banking Corp.  climbed 1.5 percent to A$22.90.
National Australia Bank Ltd. rose 1.5 percent to A$24.57.
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. gained 1.1 percent to
A$24.10.  “We see this as a major win for the major banks,”
analysts led by  Jarrod Martin  at Credit Suisse in Sydney said in
a note to clients dated today. A proposal to let Australian
financial-services providers issue covered bonds and broaden
access to funds will help the top lenders the most, the
brokerage said.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 10 percent this year
through Dec. 10, compared with gains of 11 percent by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 8.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Shares in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.7
times  estimated earnings  on average, compared with 14.5 times
for the S&P 500 and 12.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters for this story:
