House Majority Leader  Steny Hoyer , a
Maryland Democrat, told reporters that the U.S. House of
Representatives will approve a tax-cut bill after the Senate
passes the measure this week.  “I think we’ll pass a bill, as opposed to simply not
passing anything” said Hoyer, in an appearance at the National
Press Club in Washington.  House Democrats plan to push for significant changes to the
provisions dealing with the estate tax included in the Senate
bill.  The bill would extend all existing income tax rates for two
more years beyond their scheduled Dec. 31 expiration. It also
would extend expanded unemployment insurance benefits through
2011, cut payroll taxes by 2 percentage points, and set the
estate tax with a $5 million per-person exemption and 35 percent
top rate. Couples would receive a $10 million allowance.  “There’s much consternation in the House about the estate
tax,” he said. “I expect there to be some consideration of
that.”  Obama had previously backed, and House Democrats in 2009
passed, a 45 percent rate and a $3.5 million tax-free allowance.  Once the Senate passes a bill, said Hoyer, lawmakers in the
House will have a chance to introduce amendments to the
legislation. The House aims to conclude all its business by Dec.
17, said Hoyer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
