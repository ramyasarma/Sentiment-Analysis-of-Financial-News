U.S. transportation companies will
continue to outperform the broader stock market in 2011 amid a
boom in global exports, according to  Edward Yardeni , chief
investment strategist at Yardeni Research Inc.  “Global exports are absolutely booming and the U.S.
benefits from that and our railroads do extremely well and so do
our airfreight companies,” Yardeni said in an interview today
on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .  The Dow Jones Transportation Average, the 20-company gauge
of railroads, trucking companies and airlines that includes
FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., has returned 24
percent this year, doubling the return in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  Of the 19 Dow Transportation companies that  reported 
results since Oct. 7, 74 percent have topped analysts’ per-share
earnings estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales increased 17 percent for the group.  The broader U.S. stock market will increase based on
earnings growth, he said.  “I’m just betting on all of the billions of people out
there that want cars, apartments and refrigerators,” New York-
based Yardeni said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
