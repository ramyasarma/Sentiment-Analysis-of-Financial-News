Gold rebounded from the biggest
weekly loss in a month after China’s decision to refrain from
raising borrowing costs boosted demand for the precious metal.
Silver and palladium also climbed.  Last week, commodities dropped on bets that China would
increase interest rates over the weekend, damping consumption of
raw materials. Before today, gold rose 26 percent this year,
reaching a record $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7. Copper jumped to
a record in London.  “The world was pricing in an interest-rate hike, and it
didn’t happen, so the industrial metals are pulling gold
higher,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services in Chicago.  Gold futures for February delivery rose $9.80, or 0.7
percent, to $1,394.70 at 11:48 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Last week, the price dropped 1.5 percent.  The metal is headed for a 10th straight annual gain. The
Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent for two years to stimulate the economy.  India is the world’s biggest gold buyer, followed by China.  The metal will climb to $1,690 next year and peak in 2012,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today in a report.  “At current price levels, gold remains a compelling trade,
but not a long-term investment,” Goldman said. “We expect that
as U.S. real rates begin to rise in 2011, the cycle will turn,
and gold prices will begin to move lower.”  Silver futures for March delivery rose 88 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $29.485 an ounce on the Comex. On Dec. 7, the metal
reached $30.75, the highest since March 1980. Before today, the
price gained 70 percent this year.  Palladium, Platinum  Palladium futures for March delivery gained $22.40, or 3.1
percent, to $755.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Before today, the metal surged 79 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $23, or 1.4
percent, to $1,698.30 an ounce. Before today, the price climbed
14 percent in 2010.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper rose to an all-time
high of $9,235.25 a metric ton. Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and
zinc also gained.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
headed for the biggest gain since Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
