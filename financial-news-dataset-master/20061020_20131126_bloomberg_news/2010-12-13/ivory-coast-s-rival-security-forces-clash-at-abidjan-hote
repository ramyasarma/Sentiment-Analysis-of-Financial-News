Security forces loyal to  Laurent Gbagbo , the Ivory Coast leader enmeshed in a political standoff,
blocked a road leading to an Abidjan hotel where his rival
 Alassane Ouattara  has been staying, leading to a clash between
the two factions today.  Shots were fired when the Republican Guard members were
confronted by the pro-Ouattara Forces Nouvelles, according to
 Amadou Coulibaly , a spokesman for Ouattara’s party, who spoke to
reporters after the incident. It wasn’t clear who fired the
shots, he said. There were no reports of injuries.  The United Nations and French security forces stepped up
their presence, moving personnel from the grounds of the hotel
to the contested route.  The Forces Nouvelles, who were part of the 2002 uprising
that split the country into a government-controlled south and
rebel-held north, have been stationed at the Golf Hotel for more
than a week as the post-election dispute between Gbagbo and
Ouattara deepened.  On Dec. 2, the country’s electoral commission declared
Ouattara winner of the Nov. 28 presidential vote, a move that
was annulled by the Constitutional Council the next day. Both
men have taken oaths of office and both have appointed prime
ministers and cabinets. The United Nations, the U.S. and the
European Union have supported Ouattara and called on Gbagbo to
transfer power to his rival.  The African Union and Economic Community of West African
States both suspended Ivory Coast from their regional blocs last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
