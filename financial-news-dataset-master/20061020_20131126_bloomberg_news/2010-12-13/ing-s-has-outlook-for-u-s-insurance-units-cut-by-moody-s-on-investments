ING Groep NV , the largest Dutch
financial-services company, had the outlook for its U.S. life-
insurance units cut by Moody’s Investors Service on investment
losses, charges and preparations for an initial public offering.  Moody’s changed the outlook on the U.S. units, as well as
ING Verzekeringen NV, to “negative” from “developing,”
according to a statement today. The Dutch company agreed to
separate U.S. and European insurance businesses from its banking
units by the end of 2013 to gain European Commission approval
for a government bailout.  “ING U.S.’s net income remains weak, due to both
continuing legacy variable annuity issues, as well as above-
average investment losses,” Moody’s said in the statement.
“The current negative outlook also incorporates the uncertainty
and execution risk associated with the IPO process.”  Moody’s left the financial-strength rating on the U.S.
units unchanged at A2. ING climbed 1 cent to 7.75 euros at the
close of Amsterdam trading. It has gained  12 percent  this year.  “Moody’s decision brings it in-line with the decision that
S&P published last week affirming all ratings,”  Raymond Vermeulen , a spokesman for ING, said in a phone interview. “We
think the outlook is a reflection of the developments in our
insurance and our U.S. insurance units.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
