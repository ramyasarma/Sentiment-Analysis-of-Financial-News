Renault SA , France’s second-largest
carmaker, forecast record sales in 2010 as government incentives
spurred demand for the automaker’s smaller models and no-frills
Dacia brand.  Sales this year will beat the 2005 high of 2.5 million
vehicles, spokeswoman  Caroline De Gezelle  said by telephone.
Renault also expects to record the industry’s highest net income
as a percentage of revenue, she said.  Renault will sell 2.6 million vehicles this year, Le Figaro
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn . Renault
expects 38 billion euros ($50.3 million) in revenue and net
income of 3.3 billion euros in 2010, the newspaper said, giving
the carmaker an 8.7 percent margin. Renault posted a 2 billion-
euro gain from the October sale of a 15 percent  Volvo AB  stake.  Medium-term objectives to be announced next February
include a 2013 operating-margin target between 4 percent and 5
percent, Le Figaro reported. Ghosn spoke with journalists from
seven French publications at a Dec. 9 dinner, Gezelle said,
declining to confirm the contents of the report.  Renault rose as much as 1.42 euros, or 3.2 percent, to
45.44 euros and was up 2.5 percent as of 12:44 p.m. in Paris
trading, the biggest gainer in the Bloomberg EMEA Auto
Manufacturers  Index . The stock has advanced 25 percent this
year, valuing the company at 13.3 billion euros.  Ghosn said in September he intended to present new medium-
term objectives with the company’s full-year results. The plan
would be split into a first period with quantitative targets and
a second with more qualitative goals, he said at the time.  Under a previous program introduced in 2006 and scrapped
two years later, Ghosn had pledged to achieve a 6 percent
operating margin and 3.3 million annual sales by last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
