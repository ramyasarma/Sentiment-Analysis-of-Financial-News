The Philadelphia Eagles’ Dec. 26
home game against the Minnesota Vikings was moved to an 8:20

flexible scheduling policy.  The San Diego Chargers’ game at the Cincinnati Bengals that
day, originally scheduled for primetime, was moved to 4:05 p.m.,
while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ home game against the Seattle
Seahawks will now begin at 4:15 p.m. instead of 1 p.m., the NFL

There are no schedule changes for Week 15 (Dec. 19) and the
matchup between the Eagles (9-4) and Vikings (5-7) marks the
