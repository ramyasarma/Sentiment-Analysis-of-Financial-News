At a time when U.S.  bond yields  are
rising at the fastest pace in more than a year, the amount the
government pays to service its record deficit is the lowest
since 2005 compared with the size of the economy.  While interest costs rose 8 percent to $414 billion in the
fiscal year ended Sept. 30 from $383.4 billion in 2009, they
fell to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product from 3.1 percent,
U.S. Treasury Department data show. That’s the lowest in five
years, when it was the same percentage, and below the 3.6
percent in 2001, when the U.S. last had a  budget surplus .  Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields rose last week by
the most since August 2009. Bond prices tumbled as President
 Barack Obama ’s agreement to extend Bush-era tax cuts showed the
government is ready to increase the deficit to lower the  jobless
rate  at the same time the Federal Reserve prints money to ward
off deflation.  “It is an inflection point when the interest costs on the
government’s debt starts to rise because the amount of debt is
so high,” said  Phillip Swagel , assistant secretary for economic
policy at the Treasury in 2007 and 2008 who’s now a professor at
Georgetown University in Washington. “Rates are still
reasonably low. But at some point increasing interest costs is
going to be what forces more action on this issue.”  Adding to Debt  The agreement between Obama and Senate leaders set the
estate tax at the lowest rate in 80 years, extended jobless aid
and cut payroll taxes by 2 percentage points. The proposed
legislation would add $857 billion to the federal debt over 10
years, government analysts said.  On Dec. 7, the day after Obama announced the tax deal,
demand at the government’s auction of $32 billion in three-year
notes was the least since February. The Treasury said it
received $2.91 in bids for each $1 of the notes sold, down from
$3.26 a month earlier.  Ten-year yields rose 31 basis points last week, or 0.31
percentage point, the most since August 2009. The benchmark note
 yielded  3.37 percent at 7:19 a.m. in New York, according to
BGCantor Market Data, the highest since June. The 2.625 percent
security due in November 2020 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000
face amount, to 93 26/32.  Even with the increase, yields remain more than two
percentage points  below  the 5.44 percent average of the past two
decades. The average for Treasury notes and bonds fell to about
1.90 percent on Dec. 10 from 2.07 percent a year ago, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Treasury Master Index.  Yield Forecasts  Ten-year yields will be little changed at 3.30 percent by
the end of the third quarter, according to the median estimate
of more than 60 economists and strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Two-year note yields may rise to 1 percent from 0.68
percent, according to the survey.  “The deficit situation will improve as long-term growth
improves,” said  Jeffrey Caughron,  associate partner in Oklahoma
City at Baker Group LP, which advises community banks on
investing assets totaling $23 billion. “Bond yields will move
back to the range we’ve seen for the last 12 to 18 months, but
they won’t move dramatically higher.”  Obama has directed his economic team to begin analyzing
options for overhauling the U.S. tax code to help trim the  long-
term deficit , an administration official said Dec. 10. No
decisions have been made about options or a timeline for
presenting a plan to lawmakers, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity because no formal action has been taken.  Rising Expense  Interest paid by the Treasury to service its debt in the
first two months of fiscal 2011 rose 6.9 percent to $43.5
billion from $40.7 billion in the period a year earlier in part
because the government has taken advantage of record-low
borrowing costs to sell more longer-dated securities.  The  average  maturity of  marketable Treasury debt  rose to 59
months from 49.4 months in March 2009 while the outstanding
amount jumped 25 percent to $8.75 trillion in November from
$7.01 trillion at the end of fiscal 2009, according to
government data.  “The Treasury is still going to be borrowing an enormous
amount and interest rates are off the lows,” said  Ward McCarthy , chief financial economist at New York-based Jefferies
& Co. “There is a good chance that interest expense will
continue to increase, which is a consequence of the massive
budget deficit that we are running these days.”  Fiscal Deficit  Economists at New York-based Morgan Stanley project the
2011 fiscal deficit will total $1.295 trillion, assuming the tax
plan is implemented, compared with $1.3 trillion in the year
ended Sept. 30. That would equal 8.6 percent of GDP, based on
the firm’s economic growth forecast. The shortfall would total
$1.11 trillion, or 7 percent of the economy, in 2012, they said.  At the start of the year, Morgan Stanley expected 10-year
yields to reach 5.5 percent by the end of December. Now, the
firm says they may only rise to 4 percent by the end of 2011.  The deficit swelled from $455 billion in 2008 because of
government programs to jolt the economy out of its deepest slump
since the Great Depression. U.S. debt sales rose to a record
$2.15 trillion this year from $2.109 trillion in 2009.  Bond yields fell, with the 10-year Treasury rate bottoming
at 2.33 percent in October when the consumer price index
excluding food and energy rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier,
the smallest increase on record. It’s rising now on speculation
the Fed’s plan to buy $600 billion of U.S. debt through June
will help spark the economy and inflation.  Pimco’s Outlook  Bill Gross , who oversees the world’s largest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said in October that asset
purchases by the Fed likely signifies the end of the 30-year
bull market in bonds. Fiscal stimulus will help the economy
expand as much as 3.5 percent next year, according to  Mohamed El-Erian , the chief executive officer of Pimco, which oversees
$1.24 trillion. That compares with the 2.2 percent gain forecast
for this year by the International Monetary Fund.  “The U.S. is using fiscal and monetary policy to try to
attain escape velocity for the economy,” El-Erian said in a
telephone interview on Dec. 9 from Newport Beach, California.
“What we don’t know yet is whether that will be enough not just
to change the economy’s trajectory for one year but to place it
on a medium-term sustainable path.”  Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5 percent annual
rate in the third quarter, according to a government report on
Nov. 23. Then on Dec. 3 the Labor Department said the
unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent in November, the highest
since 9.9 percent in April.  Bond Losses  U.S. government debt has lost 3.4 percent on average,
including reinvested interest, since 10-year Treasury yields
bottomed on Oct. 8, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index. That compares with a total return of about 7
percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index.  The five-year, five-year  forward  breakeven rate the Fed
uses to chart investor expectations for inflation surged to 3.09
percent last week from an almost two-year low of 2.18 percent on
Aug. 24. The rate averaged 2.6 percent the five years before the
beginning of the financial crisis.  “All the talk about deficits has re-awakened bond
investors to the realization that we have a very serious long-
run problem,” said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington and  former  associate
director of the Office of Management and Budget in 1995 and
1996.  “There has been bond market ostrich behavior with people
thinking ‘well deficits don’t matter,’” he said. “The rise in
yields is a natural correction as we had a semi-bond market
bubble beforehand with interest rates being too low for too
long.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
