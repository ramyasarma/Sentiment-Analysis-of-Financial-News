The number of applications
downloaded to smartphones made by  Apple Inc. ,  Motorola Inc . and
other manufacturers will surge by 60 percent a year and generate
more than $35 billion by 2014, a report says.  Mobile-phone users will download 76.9 billion programs for
games, news and entertainment by 2014, up from 10.9 billion this
year, Framingham, Massachusetts-based research firm IDC said
today in a statement.  Apple’s iPhone has become the most sought-after phone in
the U.S., according to Nielsen Co., in part because of the more
than 300,000 apps that can be downloaded from the company’s App
Store, including the “Angry Birds” game and “TuneIn Radio”
music program. The 80,000-plus apps available for phones based
on  Google Inc. ’s Android platform has helped spur sales of the
Motorola Droid, and other Android phones made by  HTC Corp.  and
Samsung Electronics Co.  Google shares rose $2.41 to $594.62 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Apple gained $1.11 to $321.67.  To contact the reporters on this story:
