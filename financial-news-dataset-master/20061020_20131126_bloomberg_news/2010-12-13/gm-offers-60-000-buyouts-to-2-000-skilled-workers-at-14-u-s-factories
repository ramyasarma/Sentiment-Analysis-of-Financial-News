General Motors Co. , the largest U.S.
automaker, said it will offer early-retirement packages worth
$60,000 each to about 2,000 skilled-trades workers at 14 U.S.
plants.  GM announced the offer today and aims to eliminate the
positions by March, said  Tom Wilkinson , a company spokesman.
Eight of the 14 plants are scheduled to close and two may shut
if GM doesn’t need them.  GM has been adjusting its North American manufacturing
staff since emerging from bankruptcy on July 10 last year.
Detroit-based GM has invested more than $3 billion in U.S.
factories and will keep line workers at the 14 plants.  GM said Nov. 30 that it will hire 1,000 engineers in
Michigan over the next two years to help expand the automakers’
lineup of electric-drive vehicles.  GM fell 1 cent to $33.80 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 2.4 percent
from their $33 sale price in an initial public offering last
month.  CNBC reported the retirement incentives earlier without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
