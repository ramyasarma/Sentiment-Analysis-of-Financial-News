India plans to hold global bidding
by mid 2011 for developers to set up power plants that use a mix
of solar and fossil fuels.  “We propose a demonstration of solar-thermal hybrid
plants,” Deepak Gupta, secretary of the Ministry of New and
Renewable Energy, said at a conference today in Mumbai. “We’re
deciding right now how much capacity it should be.”  Gupta said the plants will be allowed to use a mix of solar
and natural gas or other fossil fuels depending on what is most
suitable to the location.  To contact the reporter on this story:
