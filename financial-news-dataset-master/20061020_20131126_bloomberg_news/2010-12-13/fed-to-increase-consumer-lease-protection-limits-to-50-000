The U.S. Federal Reserve proposed
two rules that would raise consumer protection coverage limits
for credit transactions and leases.  The rules would increase the limits to $50,000, according
to a Fed  statement  today. Amounts will be adjusted annually to
reflect any increase in the consumer price index, the Fed said.
Consumer loans of more than $25,000 are generally exempt from
the protections of the Truth in Lending Act, and leases where
the consumer’s total obligation exceeds $25,000 are also exempt
from safeguards of the Consumer Leasing Act.  The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to disclose
important terms of consumer loans and prohibits lenders from
engaging in certain practices. The Consumer Leasing Act requires
lessors to provide consumers with disclosures regarding the cost
and other terms of personal property leases, such as automobile
leases. The $50,000 limit for leases would apply to everything
consumers are required to pay under the lease excluding taxes,
the Fed said.  The financial overhaul bill enacted July 21 included a
provision to extend coverage to $50,000 effective July 21, 2011.  Consumer Credit  Consumer credit  climbed by $3.38 billion in October after
increasing a revised $1.23 billion in September, the Fed  said
Dec. 7 in Washington. Non-revolving loans rose for a third month
as federal government education-related lending jumped an
unadjusted $31.8 billion.  The report showed credit-card debt fell for a 26th
consecutive time, as Americans continue to pay down debt, one
reason spending has been slow to recover.  Car sales  last month
climbed to the highest level in a year and holiday purchases
have perked up, indicating households may soon start borrowing
again.  Private education loans and loans secured by real property,
such as mortgages, are already covered by the Truth in Lending
Act, regardless of the amount of the loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
