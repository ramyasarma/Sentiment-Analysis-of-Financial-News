An advance above a level of 1,228 on
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  is adding to bullish signals for
the U.S. stocks gauge that may indicate further gains, according
to BGC Partners.  The S&P 500 closed above that level on Dec. 8 and rallied
to 1,240.4 on Dec. 10, the  highest  since the week following the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008. The
move suggests that the trading range that existed between April
and November has ended and investors should maintain bullish
positions, said  Jamie Coutts , a Singapore-based technical
analyst at BGC.  On Dec. 7, the S&P 500 reversed 61.8 percent of its plunge
from October 2007 to March 2009, breaching the  Fibonacci level 
at which rallies in April and November had stalled, according to
Coutts. In Fibonacci analysis, the difference between high and
low points on charts is divided into retracement levels such as
23.6 percent, 38.2 percent and 61.8 percent. The ratios were
identified by 13th century mathematician Leonardo of Pisa and
correspond to proportions found in nature.  “The pattern is bullish,” Coutts said in a telephone
interview from Singapore today. “Liquidity is being actively
pumped in and these conditions can be sustained.”  The S&P 500 is 21 percent above this year’s low on July 2
after companies reported higher-than-estimated  profit  and the
Federal Reserve unveiled a plan for increased asset purchases.
Still, Coutts cautioned against investors that do not currently
hold bullish positions making new bets on gains in stocks.  “Just about every sentiment indicator is showing
overwhelmingly bullish readings and from a contrarian standpoint
you’d want to be cautious,” Coutts said. “The market is
continuing to rise but with fewer and fewer participants.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
