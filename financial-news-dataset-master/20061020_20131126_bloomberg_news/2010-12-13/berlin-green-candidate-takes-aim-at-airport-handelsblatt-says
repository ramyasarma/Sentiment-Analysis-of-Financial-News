Berlin’s Green Party candidate for
mayor,  Renate Kuenast , said the development of Berlin-
Brandenburg International airport should take complaints about
noise pollution and flight routes into consideration,
 Handelsblatt  reported citing an interview.  Taking advantage of growing objections by Berliners against
flight routes for the new airport, scheduled to open in 2012,
Kuenast recommended mediation between developers and protesters
similar to a process used for the controversial construction of
a train station in the city of Stuttgart, Handelsblatt said.  Kuenast will challenge Berlin’s Social Democratic Mayor
 Klaus Wowereit  in state elections next November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
