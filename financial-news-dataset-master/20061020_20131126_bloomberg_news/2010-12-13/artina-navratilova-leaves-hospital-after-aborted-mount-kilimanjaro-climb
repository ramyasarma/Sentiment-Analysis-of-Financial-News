Martina Navratilova  was discharged
from a Nairobi hospital after recovering from high-altitude
pulmonary edema, which forced her to give up climbing  Mount
Kilimanjaro  three days ago, organizers of the fundraising event
said.  “I am feeling much better and really pleased to be going
home,” the 18-time Grand Slam singles tennis champion said in a
statement on the website of  Laureus , the climb’s sponsor.  The 54-year-old was helped down Africa’s highest peak by
porters after feeling unwell on the fourth day of the charity
climb. Medical tests showed she was suffering from an
accumulation of fluid in the lungs.  The nine-time Wimbledon champion had been leading a team of
27 climbers to raise money for the  Laureus Sport for Good
Foundation . The charity supports community sports projects
around the world.  Despite blizzards and torrential rain, 18 team members
reached the 5,895-meter top of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania
yesterday.  “I was so pleased to hear that so many of them made it to
the summit despite the weather conditions, and I hope people
reward their efforts by continuing to donate,” to the Laureus
charity, Navratilova said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
