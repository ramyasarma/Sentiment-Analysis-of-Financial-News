Public Investment Corp., which
manages the pensions of South African government workers, is in
talks to buy the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront property in Cape
Town, Wayne van der Vent, the PIC’s general manager of real-
estate investment, said.  “We have not secured a transaction,” he said in a mobile-
phone interview. “We have always been involved in the V&A
Waterfront discussions since day one, four years ago. We have
never left those negotiations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
