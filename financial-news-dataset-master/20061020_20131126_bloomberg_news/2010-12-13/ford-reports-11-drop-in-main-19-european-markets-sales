Ford Motor Co.  said vehicle sales in
its primary European market fell 11 percent in November from a
year earlier as the overall market contracted and competitors
maintained “heavy” discounts.  Registrations in the 19-nation region declined to 100,500
cars, the U.S. carmaker’s Cologne, Germany-based European
division said today in a statement. Ford’s share of the market,
which it called “very weak overall,” slipped 0.5 percentage
points from a year ago to 8.1 percent.  Ford’s registrations in the first 11 months this year
dropped 10 percent to 1.2 million vehicles with the carmaker’s
market share declining 0.6 percentage points to 8.5 percent.
Overall industry European sales fell for an eighth consecutive
month, by 5.2 percent to 1.23 million units.  The carmaker, based in Dearborn, Michigan, posted its
largest quarterly profit ever in the third quarter as buyers
were prepared to pay higher average prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
