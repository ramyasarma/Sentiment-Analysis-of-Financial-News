Toyota Motor Corp ., the world’s
largest automaker, is recalling 94,126 model year 2011 Sienna
minivans because brakes may become partially stuck.  Toyota, based in Toyota City, Japan, said it will recall
Siennas produced from December 2009 through early November to
replace the brake light switch bracket, which may become
deformed when a driver presses on the foot-operated parking
brake. That may cause brake lights to remain on or the brakes to
partially engage, Toyota said in an e-mailed statement today.  Toyota said it doesn’t know of any accidents or injuries
related to the defect.  Toyota, which conducted the U.S. recall voluntarily, said
in a filing with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration that it began receiving reports about brake
pedals remaining partially engaged and brake lights staying on
without the brake pedal being applied in December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
