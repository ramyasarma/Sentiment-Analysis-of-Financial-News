Almost two-thirds of U.K.  retailers 
predict Christmas sales will be the same or better than last
year as stores step up discounts, the British Retail Consortium
said.  Thirty-five percent of retailers surveyed said sales will
be better than last year, and 29 percent predicted they will be
the same, while 36 percent expected sales to decrease, the
London-based group said in an e-mailed statement today. Forty-
one percent of stores are offering more discounts and promotions
to customers than they did last year.  Christmas sales may also be boosted as consumers bring
forward purchases ahead of an increase in the sales-tax rate in
January. Prime Minister David Cameron’s government is increasing
the rate as part of the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War
II, aimed at reducing the record  budget deficit.  Officials have
warned the measures may harm Britain’s economic recovery, and
 consumer confidence  has declined.  “Promotions have hit a new level of intensity, retailers
believe the next VAT rise is bringing sales forward and
Christmas is usually a time when people spend despite their
economic worries,” BRC Director General  Stephen Robertson  said
in the statement. “But ultimately December could prove to be
the ninth month in a row of weak year-on-year growth.”  Seventy-one percent of retailers said they believe
customers are bringing forward purchases to avoid the VAT
increase, according to the report. The BRC surveyed 17
retailers, representing 51 percent of the U.K. retail industry,
between Nov. 22 and Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
