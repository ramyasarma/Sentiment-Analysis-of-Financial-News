The U.S. Department of
Transportation said it assessed a $600,000 civil penalty against
JetBlue Airways Corp. for violating rules protecting air
travelers with disabilities and for failing to disclose when
flights sold by the carrier were being operated under a code-
sharing arrangement.  The agency said $350,000 of the pentalty must be paid by
the carrier and as much as $250,000 may be used to improve its
service to disabled passengers. The information was disclosed in
an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
