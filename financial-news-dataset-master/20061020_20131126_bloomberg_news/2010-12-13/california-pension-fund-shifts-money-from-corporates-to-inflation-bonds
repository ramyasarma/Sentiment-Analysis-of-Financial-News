The California Public Employees
Retirement System, the largest public pension plan in the U.S.,
will reduce its holdings in corporate bonds by 4.1 percentage
points, moving the money into cash, inflation-linked bonds and
infrastructure.  The fund’s governing board today agreed to invest 15.9
percent in bonds, down from its 20 percent target. To reach that
goal, Calpers would have to sell about $14.6 billion of the
fixed-income holdings it reported as of Oct. 31. The board will
increase investments in U.S. Treasuries and cash to 4 percent
from 2 percent.  The $218 billion fund earned 13.3 percent on its holdings
in fiscal 2010, following a loss of 23.4 percent in 2009, the
biggest annual drop in the pension’s  78-year history . The loss,
coming as the economic crisis felled Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and pushed global  stock markets  down 31 percent, prompted
Calpers to seek more from taxpayers to cover retiree benefits.  “We are signaling the direction of the fund we’d like to
take,” Chief Investment Officer Joe Dear said today.  The board agreed to keep its private-equity holdings at
about 14 percent of assets and real estate at 10 percent. It
will increase to 3 percent from 1 percent the amount it invests
in inflation-linked bonds. Calpers will continue to put about 49
percent in public stocks.  The asset allocation shift assumes the fund will earn 7.38
percent, the same it estimated before today’s change.  Changes Every 3 Years  The board last changed its asset allocation in June 2009 in
response to the recession. Calpers usually makes such changes
every three years.  The fund’s 13-member administration board will decide as
early as February whether to lower its assumed minimum annual
rate of return on assets, currently at 7.75 percent. If the rate
is cut, the plan will seek larger contributions from taxpayers
to cover pension costs unless benefits are curtailed. The plan
serves about 1.6 million current and retired government workers.  The fund held $225 billion the day before Lehman collapsed
in September 2008, triggering a  slide  in equity markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
