Palm oil futures surged to the
highest level in more than 30 months on speculation that a drop
in November output and stockpiles in Malaysia, the second-
largest producer, may strain global supplies.  February-delivery futures gained as much as 2.8 percent to
3,736 ringgit ($1,190) a metric ton, the highest since May 27,
2008, and traded at 3,730 ringgit at 4:38 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.
The contract advanced 3.3 percent last week.  “The production outlook for December is looking no better
as rainy weather continues to plague estates and the sector is
going into its seasonal down cycle which typically occurs in the
January-March period,”  Bernard Ching , an analyst at ECM Libra
Capital Sdn., said in a report today.  Output in Malaysia fell to the lowest level in five months
while stockpiles slid for the first time in four months. Heavy
rainfall caused by a La Nina weather event has reduced oil-palm
yields in Indonesia and Malaysia, the biggest producers.  Production declined 11 percent to 1.46 million tons last
month from 1.64 million tons in October, according to data from
the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Inventory dropped 8.7 percent to
1.64 million tons from 1.79 million tons, and exports gained 2.7
percent to 1.5 million tons.  Malaysian inventory may decline further with a pick-up in
demand for the festival season, Ching said. Chinese purchases
rise before the Lunar New Year, when demand for food soars. The
celebration will take place in early February.  Trading Curbs  Palm oil has rallied 38 percent this year, headed for its
second straight annual advance, on optimism that rising demand
in China may strain global supplies curbed by rain and drought
in producing nations. The gains may extend in early 2011, ECM
Libra’s Ching said. Prices of more than 4,000 ringgit may cool
demand among consumers and prompt China and India to impose
trading restrictions to cool inflation, he said.  India, the world’s second-biggest cooking oil user,
imported 668,917 tons of vegetable oils last month, 11 percent
less than the 753,966 tons bought a year earlier, the Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India said today.  China will offer 300,000 tons of reserve soybeans stored
under the so-called inter-province stock rotation program in
auctions on Dec. 14, the official information provider National
Grain & Oil Trade Center said today on its website.  March-delivery soybean oil rose as much as 1.5 percent to
55.47 cents a pound in Chicago and traded at that level at 4:27
p.m. in Singapore, while soybeans for delivery in January traded
1 percent higher at $12.8625 a bushel.  Palm oil on the Dalian Commodity Exchange for September
delivery climbed 2.4 percent to 9,414 yuan ($1,413) a ton, the
highest close in more than a month, while soybean oil for
delivery in the same month added 1.8 percent to 9,986 yuan, the
highest since Nov. 12.  CME Group Inc.’s March palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, surged as much as 2.3 percent to
$1,163 a ton, the highest level since the contract began trading
in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
