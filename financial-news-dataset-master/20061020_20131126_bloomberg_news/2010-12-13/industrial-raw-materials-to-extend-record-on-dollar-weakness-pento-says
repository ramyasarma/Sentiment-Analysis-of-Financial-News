An index tracking industrial raw
materials has surged to a record and may keep rising as a weaker
dollar boosts U.S. exports and demand from investors, said
 Michael Pento , a senior economist at Euro Pacific Capital Inc.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Spot Raw Industrials
Index, which includes items that don’t trade on futures
exchanges such as copper scrap, burlap and cattle hides, climbed
to 575.07 on Dec. 10, the highest since at least May 1981. The
gauge of 22 commodities, up 19 percent this year, may jump
another 10 percent next year, Pento said by telephone from New
York.  “The crumbling of the currency, and the fear and reality
of inflation, are being priced into these commodity values,”
said Pento, who correctly predicted the 2008 commodity collapse.  The  U.S. Dollar Index , a six-currency gauge, touched an 11-
month low on Nov. 4, the day after the Federal Reserve said it
planned to buy $600 billion of U.S. Treasuries to shore up the
economy. The dollar has gained about 4.7 percent since then,
while still 11 percent below a peak in June. The currency
dropped as much as 1.2 percent today, while 17 of the 19
exchange-traded commodities tracked by the CRB gained.  Rising demand in emerging markets including China, Brazil
and Chile has contributed to the jump in commodity prices, Pento
said. Still, the surge “has been maybe 30 percent on supply and
growth concerns, and 70 percent dollar concerns,” he said.  Copper prices are up 26 percent this year and cotton jumped
to a record $1.5195 a pound on Nov. 10 as world supplies of both
commodities trailed burgeoning demand from China. Since the end
of June, corn surged 56 percent and wheat is up 62 percent, on
reports of shrinking global inventories.  Precious metals may provide “the best bang for your buck”
in 2011, with gold extending a rally to a record $1,800 an ounce
next year, Pento said. Gold futures closed at $1,398 today on
the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
