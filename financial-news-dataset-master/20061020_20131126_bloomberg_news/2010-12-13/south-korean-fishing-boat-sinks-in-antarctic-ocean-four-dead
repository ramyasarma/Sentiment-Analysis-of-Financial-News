A South Korean fishing vessel sank
in waters near Antarctica today, killing five sailors and
leaving 17 others missing, with hopes for their survival in
near-freezing water fading.  “As time passes, the chances of any of the remaining crew
surviving are increasingly slim,” Maritime New Zealand said in
a  statement  posted on its website. Twenty people were rescued
after the 614-ton boat, named No. 1 In Sung, sank in an area
about 1,400 miles (2,250 kilometers) south of New Zealand, the
 foreign ministry  in Seoul said.  No information about the cause of the sinking is available,
and the search for survivors will continue through the night,
Maritime New Zealand said. The ship sunk quickly, forcing those
on board to jump into the water without life jackets, according
to the statement. The sea temperature is about 2 degrees Celsius
(36 degrees Fahrenheit), and people without lifejackets can die
in 10 minutes, it said.  South Korea has asked New Zealand to help with rescue
efforts, the ministry said. Two adjacent New Zealand fishing
vessels assisted with searching until 4:30 p.m., and Rescue
Coordination Centre New Zealand will decide whether it will
continue searching in the morning, the maritime authority said.  The 42 from the vessel included sailors and fishermen from
South Korea, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia and
Vietnam, the foreign ministry said.  The 20 survivors and five bodies are on a fishing vessel
named No. 707 Hongjin, Maritime New Zealand said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
