Legg Mason Inc ., the Baltimore-based
asset manager, hired  Peter H. Nachtwey  from private-equity firm
Carlyle Group as chief financial officer.  Nachtwey will join Legg Mason’s executive committee, the
firm said today in a statement. He was Washington-based
Carlyle’s chief financial officer from 2007 to 2010, according
to the statement.  The hiring of Nachtwey ends a six-month search for Legg
Mason after former finance chief Charles J. Daley left to join
another asset manager. Legg Mason Chief Executive Officer  Mark Fetting  has said one of his priorities is to expand the firm’s
investment units by offering new products, hiring new managers
and through acquisitions.  At Carlyle, Nachtwey oversaw the structuring, reporting and
budgeting of more than $90 billion in assets in more than 70
funds. Before that, he spent 25 years at Deloitte & Touche LLP.  Legg Mason’s manages $668 billion through investment
affiliates including Western Asset Management and  Bill Miller ’s
Legg Mason Capital Management.  Terrence Murphy , who had served
as interim CFO, will return to his earlier role as chief
operating officer of ClearBridge Advisors, Legg Mason’s largest
stock-fund unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
