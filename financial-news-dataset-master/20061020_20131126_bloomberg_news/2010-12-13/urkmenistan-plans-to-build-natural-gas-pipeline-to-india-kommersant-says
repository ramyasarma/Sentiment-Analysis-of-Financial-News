Turkmenistan signed an agreement
Dec. 11 to build gas pipeline to India via Afghanistan and
Pakistan, known as TAPI link,  Kommersant  reported.  The 1,730 kilometers (1,075 miles) pipeline may be
completed by the end of 2015 and will supply 33 billion cubic
meters of Turkmen gas a year to the Asian countries, the
newspaper said, citing the agreement.  India and Pakistan will each receive 14 billion cubic
meters of gas a year, while Afghanistan will get 5 billion cubic
meters, Kommersant said. Russia is not participating in the
