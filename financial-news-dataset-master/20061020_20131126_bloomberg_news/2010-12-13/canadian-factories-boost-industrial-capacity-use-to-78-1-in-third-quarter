Canadian industrial companies’ use
of their production capacity rose more than predicted in the
third quarter, the fifth straight advance from last year’s
record low, led by manufacturing.  The share of plant  capacity  in use increased to 78.1
percent in the July-September period from a revised 76.9 percent
in the previous quarter, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted the rate would be
76.5 percent, based on the median of 14 estimates.  Industrial production has rebounded this year from a record
low 67.8 percent in the second quarter of last year when the
Canadian economy was shrinking, echoing rebounds in employment
and output.  Manufacturing  capacity use  increased to 81.2 percent from
78.7 percent in the second quarter, as 15 of 21 industries
tracked by the agency recorded a gain. Transportation equipment
manufacturers gained 4 percentage points to 74.3 percent on
higher demand for vehicles. Machinery factories advanced 8.7
percentage points to 85.4 percent, Statistics Canada said.  Fabricated metals plants operated at 76.7 percent of
capacity, up from 71.9 percent. Outside of manufacturing,
forestry and logging operations increased capacity use to 95.9
percent from 90.8 percent in the second quarter, reflecting the
closure of operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
