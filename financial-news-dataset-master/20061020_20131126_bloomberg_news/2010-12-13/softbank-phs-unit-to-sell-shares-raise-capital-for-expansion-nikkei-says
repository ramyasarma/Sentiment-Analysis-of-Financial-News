Softbank Corp.’s personal handyphone
system affiliate, Wireless City Planning Inc., will receive
investment from five non-Japanese companies to raise its capital
to 20 billion yen ($240 million), the Nikkei newspaper reported,
without citing anyone. The report didn’t provide the current
level of capital.  Softbank and Advantage Partners LLP will retain stakes of
33.3 percent each, with Ericsson LM, Nokia Siemens Networks,
Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. holding
the rest, the report said. Wireless City will invest 100 billion
yen to increase coverage to 90 percent of the Japanese
population by 2013, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
