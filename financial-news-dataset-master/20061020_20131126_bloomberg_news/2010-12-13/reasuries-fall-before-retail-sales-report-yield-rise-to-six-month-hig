Treasury notes fell before
tomorrow’s Federal Reserve meeting, pushing 10-year  yields  to a
six-month high, on speculation reports this week will add to
signs the recovery is sustainable.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year notes over
2-year debt was the highest since April as economists raised
growth estimates after President  Barack Obama ’s agreement to
extend tax cuts. Ten-year notes, which declined  last week  by the
most since August 2009, also fell as stocks gained.  “The economy is certainly one of the reasons why yields
are going higher,” said  Glenn Marci , a fixed-income strategist
at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt. “On a 2011 perspective, we think
yields will still go higher a bit.”  The yield on the 10-year note gained three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.36 percent at 7:28 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 fell 9/32, or $2.81
per $1,000 face amount, to 93 7/8. The yield earlier climbed to
3.39 percent, the highest level since June 3.  Two-year yields advanced two basis points to 0.67 percent
after increasing to 0.69, the highest since June 23. The  spread 
between 2- and 10-year yields touched 2.73 percentage points,
the widest on an intraday basis since April 30.  Fed policy makers meeting may signal tomorrow that they are
open to boosting debt purchases beyond the $600 billion already
announced to spur job growth and avoid deflation.  Bernanke’s View  Buying more government bonds is “certainly possible,”
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in an interview broadcast on CBS
Corp.’s “60 Minutes” program aired on Dec. 5, referring to the
Fed’s policy of quantitative easing. “It depends on the
efficacy of the program” and the outlook for inflation and the
economy, Bernanke said.  Sustaining growth may be challenging without an improvement
in the  unemployment rate,  which climbed to a seven-month high of
9.8 percent in November.  Retail sales  rose for a fifth month in November, increasing
0.6 percent, as Americans began their holiday shopping,
according to the median forecast of 62 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey before tomorrow’s report from the Commerce
Department. Sales rose 1.2 percent in October.  Production at factories, mines and utilities increased 0.3
percent in November after stalling in October, economists
projected before a Fed report on Dec. 15.  Last Week’s Drop  Treasuries slumped last week, pushing 10-year yields up by
31 basis points, after Obama agreed on Dec. 6 to a two-year
extension of current tax rates in exchange for another 13 months
of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and cutting the
payroll tax by $120 billion for a year.  Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages the
world’s biggest bond fund, raised its forecast for U.S. growth
in 2011 as policy makers pump a “massive amount” of stimulus
into the economy, Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian said
on Dec. 9.  Treasuries also declined as the  MSCI Asia Pacific  index of
shares climbed 0.5 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
advanced 0.4 percent.  Consumer prices excluding food and fuel costs rose 0.6
percent in November from a year earlier, matching October’s
increase that was the smallest annual gain on record, according
to a Bloomberg News survey before a report from the Labor
Department on Dec. 15.  Fed Debt Buying  The Fed will purchase about $105 billion of Treasuries
during the next month, the New York Fed said in a schedule
posted Dec. 10 on its  website . The central bank will buy today
$7 billion to $9 billion of debt maturing from June 2016 to
November 2017.  The amount the U.S. government pays to service its record
deficit is the lowest since 2005 compared with the size of the
economy.  While interest costs rose 8 percent to $414 billion in the
fiscal year ended Sept. 30 from $383.4 billion in 2009, they
fell to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product from 3.1 percent,
Treasury Department data show. That’s the lowest in five years,
when it was the same percentage, and below the 3.6 percent in
2001, when the U.S. last had a  budget surplus .  To contact the reporters on this story:
