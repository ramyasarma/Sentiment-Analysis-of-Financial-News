South Africa’s new economic growth
plan was endorsed by Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and
former chief economist of the World Bank, Business Day reported,
citing Stiglitz.  The policies outlined in the plan have the right focus on
creating jobs, investing in infrastructure and boosting
competition, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Stiglitz as
saying. Stiglitz also agreed with the plan’s emphasis on a
stable currency, adding that successful emerging market
economies have “taken seriously the task of exchange rate
management,” Business Day said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
