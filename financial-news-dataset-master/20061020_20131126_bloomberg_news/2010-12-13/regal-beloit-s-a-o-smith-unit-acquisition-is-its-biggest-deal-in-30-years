Regal Beloit Corp., the electric
motor and generator manufacturer, said it will buy A.O. Smith
Corp.’s electric motor division for $875 million in its largest
acquisition since at least 1980.  Regal, based in Beloit, Wisconsin, will acquire 100 percent
of the stock and assets of  A.O. Smith’s  Electric Products Co.
for $700 million in cash and about $175 million in Regal common
stock, according to a statement by Regal. The purchase will be
the company’s largest in 30 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Combined technology from Regal and the motor division will
help Regal focus on new products, said  Mark Gliebe , president
and chief operating officer of Regal, in a conference call
today.  “EPC does have a patent portfolio of roughly 150 unique
patents,” Gliebe said. “That’s quite an asset for the
company.”  The boards of both companies agreed to the deal, which is
expected to close in the first half of 2011, according to a
statement by Milwaukee-based A.O. Smith.  “We believe the transaction may be $0.25-$0.50 accretive
in the first full year of operation,”  Scott Graham , an analyst
for New York-based Jefferies Group Inc., said in a note today.  Regal expects the acquisition to add annual sales of more
than $700 million in the first full year after the acquisition,
according to its statement.  Acquisition Strategy  Regal rose $2.96, or 4.6 percent, to $66.71 at 1:32 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had gained
23 percent this year before today.  The sale will help reposition A.O. Smith for an acquisition
strategy that will “develop brand equity in new high-growth
markets around the world such as South America, Australia and
even parts of Africa,” while expanding the brand in Asia, said
 Paul Jones , the company’s CEO, in a conference call today.  The deal with Regal represents more than eight times 2010
estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, Jones said.  A.O. Smith advanced $1.21, or 2.8 percent, to $44.28 at
1:32 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares had risen 49 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
