Covered bonds sold by Canadian banks
in U.S. dollars are fetching a premium over those of other
countries, as investors see the securities as a relative haven
from the sovereign debt crisis roiling Europe.  The bonds paid 49 basis points on average over benchmarks
as of Dec. 9, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.
That compares with 153 for European-issued U.S. dollar covered
bonds, 189 for British and 179 for Korean.  Canada has the lowest net debt to gross domestic product
ratio among the Group of Seven countries, drawing investors
seeking safety as Ireland taps a $112 billion European bailout
and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  pushes for bondholders to
take losses to help pay for restructurings. Covered bonds, a
$2.7 trillion market, are typically backed by mortgages or
public-sector loans.  “The very good news for covered bonds is the product is
perceived as being external both to sovereign-debt concerns and
also the conversations” around burden sharing, said  Derry Hubbard , head of covered-bond marketing and execution at BNP
Paribas SA in London. He spoke at a Euromoney conference in New
York on Dec. 9. “If you look at the Canadian market, spreads
are very reflective of just how robust that safe-haven bid is.”  ‘Back In’  U.S. dollar covered-bond issuance from Canadian lenders
including Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce accounted for about half the $30 billion total this
year, and should “dominate” in 2011, said  Heiko Langer , senior
credit analyst for covered bonds at BNP Paribas in London. He
foresees $30 billion to $40 billion in issuance next year.  “I’m hearing similar numbers,” to the BNP forecast,  Peter Walker , associate vice president of treasury and balance sheet
management at TD Bank Group, said in an interview in New York.
TD issued a $2 billion covered bond in July. “People are
expecting the Canadians to be back in there, and you’ll maybe
see some more issuers coming over from Europe.”  Walker said TD saved about 20 basis points in interest
expense by issuing covered bonds in the U.S. compared with
issuing senior debt in Canada. On a $2 billion debt sale, that
would equate to annual savings of $4 million in interest costs.  Elsewhere in credit markets,  Southern Pacific Resource
Corp. , the Canadian oil and gas company, is seeking a $275
million term loan to help finance its STP-McKay oil sands
project, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.  Alberta, Teranet  The Alberta Capital Finance Authority that lends money to
local school boards and municipalities sold C$250 million ($248
million) in a reoffering of its floating-rate notes due October
2012, bringing the total outstanding to C$450 million. The debt
pays interest at the quarterly Canada dealer offer rate, or
CDOR, plus 7 basis points, or 0.07 percentage point.  Teranet Holdings LP , whose unit owns Ontario’s electronic
land registry system, sold C$1.6 billion of debt in four parts
with maturity dates ranging from December 2015 to December 2040.
Spreads over benchmarks were 105 basis points for the five-year,
3.531 percent bonds; 192 basis points for the 21-year, 3.27
percent debt; 150 basis points for the 10-year, 4.807 percent
bonds and 200 basis points for the 30-year, 5.754 percent debt.  Financement Quebec, which seeks loans on behalf of schools,
universities and hospitals, reoffered C$100 million of floating-
rate notes due June 2016, bringing the total outstanding to
C$1.53 billion. The debt pays interest at quarterly CDOR plus 27
basis points. Three-month CDOR ended last week at 1.296 percent,
approaching its highest level since January 2009.  Corporate Spreads  The extra yield investors demand to own the debt of
Canadian investment-grade corporations rather than the federal
government narrowed to 142 basis points on Dec. 10, from 143 a
week earlier, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index. Yields increased to 4.07 percent, from 3.99 percent.
Corporate bonds have lost 1.05 percent this month.  The yield on Canada 10-year bonds increased 12 basis points
last week to 3.31 percent, as the price of the 3.5 percent
security due in June 2020 dropped C$1.01 to C$101.56. The  yield ,
which traded at 3.32 percent today, is up from 2.678 percent on
Oct. 12, the lowest level since March 2009. The bond yields
about three basis points less than the similar U.S. Treasury,
down from 26 basis points at the end of November.  Canadian two-year bonds yield 111 basis points more than
equivalent-maturity  Treasuries , down from 117 on Nov. 30.  The share of Canadian industrial companies’  plant  capacity
in use increased to 78.1 percent in the July-September period
from a revised 76.9 percent in the previous quarter, Statistics
Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
predicted the rate would be 76.5 percent.  Household Debt  Canadian households posted higher debt ratios than their
U.S. counterparts for the first time in 12 years. The ratio of
household credit market debt-to-personal disposable income rose
to 148.1 percent from 143.4 percent as income fell 1.5 percent,
Statistics Canada said in a report. In the U.S., debts represent
147.2 percent of households’ disposable income, according to the
U.S. Federal Reserve.  In the provincial bond market, relative yields were
unchanged last week at 54 basis points. Yields rose to 3.35
percent, from 3.27. The securities lost 1.2 percent in November,
the biggest drop since December 2009, and are down 1.6 percent
this month.  Covered bonds have a preferential claim on the underlying
assets and a senior claim on the issuer in the event of default.
Canada’s banks can only issue covered bonds equal to 4 percent
of balance-sheet assets.  Soundest Banks  Canadian banks are perceived as safe because they didn’t
require government assistance during the financial crisis. The
World Economic Forum has ranked them the world’s soundest for
three years running. Canada’s housing market has rebounded from
recession, with resale prices rising for 16 straight months
before declining in September.  Issuance of $30 billion to $40 billion next year is “not
an unreasonable level,” said  Andrew Kriegler , senior vice
president and treasurer at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
Toronto. CIBC sold $4.25 billion of covered bonds in the U.S.
this year, as well as smaller amounts in Australia and
Switzerland.  “We see the U.S. dollar covered-bond market as being an
important component of our funding plans going forward,”
Kriegler said. “The U.S. market is the sole biggest capital
market in the world, and it’s right next to us.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
