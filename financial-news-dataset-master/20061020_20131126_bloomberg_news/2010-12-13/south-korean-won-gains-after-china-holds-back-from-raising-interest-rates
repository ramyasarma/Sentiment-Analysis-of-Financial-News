The won rose after China refrained
from increasing interest rates, easing concern efforts to tame
inflation will dent demand for South Korea’s exports.  The People’s Bank of China last week said reserve
requirements will increase 50 basis points starting Dec. 20,
instead of adding to October’s rate increase. Inflation
accelerated to a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November. China
is South Korea’s largest export market.  “Investors are relieved that China didn’t raise interest
rates, but concern that it eventually will is a negative factor
lingering,” said  Kim Jin Ju , a currency trader at Korea
Exchange Bank in Seoul.  The won climbed 0.3 percent to 1,140.54 per dollar as of
9:34 a.m. in Seoul, after dropping 0.4 percent last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,130.80 on
Dec. 7, the strongest level since Nov. 23. The currency rose 9.4
percent in the past six months, the best performance among
Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen.  The currency dropped 0.4 percent on Dec. 10 after two
Chinese newspapers reported the inflation figure. China’s
central bank has raised rates once since December 2007, pushing
the benchmark one-year deposit rate to 2.5 percent and the
lending rate to 5.56 percent. Overseas shipments account for
about 40 percent of South Korea’s gross domestic product.  South Korean government bonds fell. The yield on the 3
percent bonds due December 2013 rose three basis points to 3.17
percent, according to the Korea Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
