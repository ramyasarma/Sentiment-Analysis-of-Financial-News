Air Liquide SA , the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, said it aims to boost annual sales
by 8 percent to 10 percent on average through 2015, helped by
demand for energy, health and electronics in emerging nations.  Air Liquide will invest 12 billion euros ($16 billion) in
the period and improve its return on capital employed, a measure
of the efficiency of its investments, to a range of 12 percent
to 13 percent, the Paris-based company said today in a
statement. The company also aims to generate more than 200
million euros per year in “operational efficiencies.”  "We are convinced that we can outpace the market, which
means that we will grab market share, both in geographic and
segment terms,’’ Chief Executive Officer  Benoit Potier  told
reporters in Paris.  Air Liquide , which reported a return on capital employed of
11.6 percent in  2009 , is making a majority of its investments in
China, Russia, the Middle East and other fast-growing regions to
meet rising demand for oxygen, hydrogen and other gases used by
the oil-and-gas industry and makers of steel, cars, flat and
solar panels, as well as hospitals and the home-care industry.  The company is targeting “sustained” profit growth in
2011 through 2015 as sales rise, Potier said. The company plans
to keep paying a  dividend  representing 45 percent to 50 percent
of net profit and wants its  credit rating  to remain in the ‘A’
range or higher, he said.  Bolt-On Acquisitions  About 70 percent of Air Liquide’s 10 billion euros of
capital spending in the next five years will be in emerging
markets, the CEO said. On top of that, more than 2 billion euros
will be used for “bolt-on, small or medium-sized  acquisitions ”
of regional companies, with a preference for those serving the
health industry, he said.  In 2015, the group will get about 33 percent of its sales
of gases and services in emerging  markets , up from 16 percent
last year, Potier said.  The market for industrial and medical gases will probably
expand by an average 7 percent to 8 percent a year from about
53 billion euros this year to about 75 billion euros at the end
of 2015, “based on present trends,” Air Liquide said.  Air Liquide  shares  rose 0.8 percent to 95.78 euros at 3:07
p.m. in Paris. They have risen 23 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 27.1 billion euros. Germany’s Linde
AG, its largest rival, has risen 32 percent, giving it a market
value of 18.9 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
