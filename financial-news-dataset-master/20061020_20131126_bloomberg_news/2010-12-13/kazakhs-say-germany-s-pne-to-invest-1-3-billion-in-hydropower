Germany’s Pure Nature Energy GmbH
may invest 1 billion euros ($1.32 billion) to construct small
hydropower plants in Kazakhstan, central Asia’s biggest oil
producer, the Industry and New Technologies Ministry said.  Lossburg-based PNE  plans to invest in building 5-megawatt
to 60-megawatt plants, mostly in eastern and southern
Kazakhstan, in the next 10 years, the Astana-based ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement. The German investors estimate
Kazakhstan’s hydropower potential at 4 gigawatts, the ministry
said.  No one was available at PNE when Bloomberg News called
before working hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
