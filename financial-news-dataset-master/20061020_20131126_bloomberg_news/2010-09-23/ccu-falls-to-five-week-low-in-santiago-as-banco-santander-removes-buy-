Cia. Cervecerias Unidas SA , Chile’s
largest brewer, slid to the lowest price in five weeks as Banco
Santander SA withdrew a “buy” rating on Chile’s biggest brewer
after it rallied to “fair levels.”  CCU dropped 1.8 percent to 5,429.2 pesos at 3:59 p.m. New
York time, the lowest closing price since Aug. 13. The Ipsa
index fell 0.9 percent to 4,730.86.  The stock had rallied 59 percent in the previous 12 months
to a record 5,899.4 pesos on Sept. 13. It fetches 17.5 times
estimated 2011 profit, an 8.2 percent premium to global peers,
Santander analysts  Carlos Herrera  and  Luis Miranda  wrote in an
e-mailed noted dated today, cutting the rating to “hold”.  “Given such valuations, further upside in the stock is
limited, and we see no triggers for multiple expansion,” they
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
