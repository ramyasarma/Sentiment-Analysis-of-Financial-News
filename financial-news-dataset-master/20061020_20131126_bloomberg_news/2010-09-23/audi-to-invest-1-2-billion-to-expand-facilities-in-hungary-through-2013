Volkswagen AG ’s Audi division will
expand production in Hungary and extend job guarantees at its
two German factories as it aims to dethrone Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG as the world’s biggest luxury-car maker by 2015.  Audi will invest 900 million euros ($1.2 billion) at a
plant in Gyor, Hungary, by 2013, creating 1,800 jobs, the
Ingolstadt, Germany-based carmaker said today in a statement.
Job guarantees at factories in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm in
Germany will be extended until Dec. 31, 2014, Audi said.  “We’re further developing our international
competitiveness by expanding the location in Gyor and are taking
steps to meet our ambitious growth targets,” Audi Chief
Executive Officer  Rupert Stadler  said in the statement.  Audi is targeting record  sales  of more than 1.08 million
cars and sport-utility vehicles this year, an increase of
14 percent from a year earlier. The carmaker aims to introduce
a dozen models in 2010, including the A1, Audi’s smallest
vehicle, and a coupe dubbed the A7, as it increases the lineup
to 42 vehicles by 2015 from 34 last year.  The VW division said it plans to make 125,000 cars a year
in Gyor starting in 2013, including the TT Coupe and TT Roadster
models.  To contact the reporter on this story:
