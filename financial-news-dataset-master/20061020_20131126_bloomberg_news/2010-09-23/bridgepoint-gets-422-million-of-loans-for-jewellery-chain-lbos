Bridgepoint Capital Ltd., a U.K.
buyout firm, got 315 million euros ($422 million) of leveraged
loans to back the buyouts of French jewelers Histoire d’Or and
Marc Orian SA.  The underwritten debt includes a 115 million-euro six-year
term loan paying interest of 450 basis points more than
benchmark lending rates, and a 145 million-euro seven-year term
loan at an interest margin of 500 basis points, according to a
statement from lenders.  Credit Agricole CIB, Lloyds Banking Group Plc, Natixis and
Societe Generale SA are coordinating the deal. Banca IMI SpA is
joining as an arranger, the lenders said. The banks will
syndicate the financing to a wider group of buyers later this
week and meeting investors in Paris on Sept. 29.  The acquisition debt represents 3.6 times the jewelers’
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization,
according to the statement. That compares with an average of
five times for new leveraged financing transactions in Europe in
the second quarter, according to Fitch Ratings.  Bridgepoint, based in London, entered exclusive talks to
acquire Histoire d’Or and Marc Orian in August. Private-equity
firms pay for takeovers by loading a target company with debt
and using its cash flow to repay lenders.  The loans also include a six-year revolving credit of 25
million euros and a six-year 30 million-euro credit to fund
capital expenditure, both paying an interest margin of 450 basis
points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
