Nine Chinese asylum seekers
protesting at an Australian detention center plan to jump from
the roof of the complex today if they aren’t released and their
cases aren’t reviewed by immigration officials, according to
refugee advocates in contact with the group.  “They’ve threatened to jump, come 5 p.m., if they haven’t
got a response from the Immigration Department,” Ian Rintoul, a
representative with the Refugee Action Coalition, said by
telephone from Sydney. “There’s no indication that officials
have gone in to speak to them.”  The two-day demonstration at the Villawood complex in
western Sydney follows a similar protest by Tamil, Iraqi and
Iranian immigrants after a Fijian facing deportation leaped from
the roof Sept. 20, focusing attention on Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s support for mandatory  detention  as the number of
detainees across the nation nears 5,000.  “There are still nine on the roof,” Sandi Logan, a
spokesman with the Immigration Department, said in a telephone
interview. Staff from the Australian unit of  Serco Group Plc ,
which manages the nation’s detention centers, are talking to the
detainees “to try to get them to come down safely,” he said.  The demonstration involves nine Chinese nationals facing
deportation, including five men and four women, one of whom is
pregnant, refugee advocate Jamal Daoud said by phone yesterday
from outside Villawood. The immigration department has
identified the protestors as Chinese.  To contact the reporter on this story:
