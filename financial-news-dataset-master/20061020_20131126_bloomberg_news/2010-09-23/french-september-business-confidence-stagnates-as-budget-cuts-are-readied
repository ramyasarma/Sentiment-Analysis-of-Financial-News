Confidence among French factory
executives was unchanged in September as the nation’s economic
recovery shifted from exporters to consumers.  An  index of sentiment  among factory executives held at 98,
matching the level of August and up from 97 in July, national
statistics office Insee said today. Confidence among retailers
jumped to 107 from 103 in August and 100 in July.  The figures show how France’s recovery from its worst
recession since World War II is now being driven by domestic
demand as well as exports, previously the main driver of the
pickup. Growth accelerated to 0.6 percent in the second quarter
from 0.2 percent in the first as companies such as BNP Paribas
SA and cosmetics maker  L’Oreal SA  begin hiring again.  “This is frankly positive, more positive than it looks at
first glance,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP
Paribas in Paris. “Above all the retail number is interesting.
All the losses from the recession have been wiped out.”  Growth may slow in the second half as President Nicolas
Sarkozy seeks to slash the government’s budget deficit,
economists said. Sarkozy has pledged to trim the budget gap to 6
percent of gross domestic product next year and to 3 percent by
2013 from about 8 percent in 2010. That’s the biggest deficit
reduction since at least 1991 and threatens to curb demand as
France recovers from its worst recession since World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
