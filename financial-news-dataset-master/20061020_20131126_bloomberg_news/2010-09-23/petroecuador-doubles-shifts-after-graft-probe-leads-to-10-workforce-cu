PetroEcuador, the South American
country’s state oil company, said it doubled employee shifts at
refineries and oil fields to maintain output after about 10
percent of its total workforce was fired amid corruption
allegations.  Crude output is normal at the nation’s refineries, which
have a combined processing capacity of about 156,000 barrels a
day, a company official who isn’t authorized to speak publicly
said today in a telephone interview.  PetroEcuador on Sept. 17 fired 628 employees accused of
operating an illegal business to sell fuel to fishermen. The
workers have 30 days to contest the allegations before they are
replaced, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
