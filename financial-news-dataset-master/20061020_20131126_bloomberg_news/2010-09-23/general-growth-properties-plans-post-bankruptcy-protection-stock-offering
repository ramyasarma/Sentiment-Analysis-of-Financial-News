General Growth Properties Inc.  said
it expects to pursue a stock offering after it emerges from
bankruptcy to replace financing commitments from some investors
instead of selling notes that would convert to equity.  The company, the second-largest U.S. mall owner, is
planning a post-bankruptcy offering that would replace “a
substantial portion” of the shares slated to be issued to an
investor group, it said in a filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan.  General Growth, based in Chicago, is approaching the end of
its bankruptcy case, which started in April 2009. It’s scheduled
to seek court approval next month for its plan to exit
bankruptcy with financing commitments from  Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. , Fairholme Capital Management LLC and Pershing
Square Capital Management LP.  General Growth has the right to replace portions of the
investors’ equity commitments through a public offering of notes
that convert to shares or through a post-bankruptcy public stock
offering, according to court papers.  General Growth has an underwriting agreement from  Goldman &
Sachs Co. ,  Deutsche Bank AG ,  Wells Fargo Securities , RBC Capital
Markets Corp.,  Barclays PLC ,  UBS Securities LLC , Macquarie Bank
Ltd. and TD Securities (USA) LLC.  General Growth also has exit-financing commitments of as
much as $1.8 billion in loans, according to the court filing.  The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
