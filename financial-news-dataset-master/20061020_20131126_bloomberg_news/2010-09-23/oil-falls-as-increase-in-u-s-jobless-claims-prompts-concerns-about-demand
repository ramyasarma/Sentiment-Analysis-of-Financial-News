Oil declined in New York after a
U.S. government report showed that initial jobless claims rose
for the first time in a month, signaling fuel demand recovery in
the world’s largest crude user may falter.  Futures erased some of yesterday’s 0.6 percent gain after
the Labor Department reported claims unexpectedly increased by
12,000 to 465,000 in the week ended Sept. 18, as the
unemployment rate holds near a 26-year high. Growth in Europe’s
services and manufacturing industries weakened more than
economists forecast in September.  “There is negative sentiment sweeping the market,” said
 Jonathan Barratt , managing director at Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney. “We’ve got enough oil. We need to see
more confidence going through the economy.”  The November contract lost as much as 52 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $74.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
and was at $74.89 at 2:24 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, it
climbed 47 cents to settle at $75.18. The contract is little
changed this week. Crude prices are down 5.5 percent this year.  “A surprise jump in jobless claims and disappointing
European economic data rattled investor sentiment,”  Ben Potter ,
a market strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said in an e-
mailed note.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.4 percent to 125.07,
paring its fourth straight weekly gain.  Brent crude for November settlement fell as much as 37
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $77.74 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange and was at $77.79. Yesterday, it
gained 16 cents to end the session at $78.11.  Tropical Storm  U.S. stocks dropped yesterday, bringing the decline in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its longest in a month. The S&P
500 fell 0.8 percent to 1,124.83, retreating for a third day,
the longest losing streak since Aug. 24. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average decreased 76.89 points, or 0.7 percent, to
10,662.42.  Tropical Storm Matthew formed in the Caribbean Sea east of
Nicaragua and may grow into a hurricane by next week, as
Tropical Storm Lisa re-emerged in the central Atlantic, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said yesterday.  Total  consumption of petroleum products  averaged 19.2
million barrels a day last week, down 1.8 percent from the seven
days ended Sept. 10, the Energy Department reported Sept. 22.
U.S. oil stockpiles rose 970,000 barrels to 358.3 million last
week. They were forecast to drop 1.75 million barrels, according
to the median of analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  West Texas Benchmark  The eight-day closing of the Enbridge Energy Partners LP 6A
pipeline, which moves 670,000 barrels a day of Canadian oil to
the U.S., caused West Texas Intermediate crude futures to trade
in a $5.29 range on the New York Mercantile Exchange last week.
That compares with $2.65 for the Brent contract in London.  Oil traders say the combination of last week’s price gap,
the widest since May, and near-record supplies at the U.S.
futures delivery point in Cushing, Oklahoma, has made West Texas
Intermediate, or WTI, an inaccurate indicator for global demand
at a time when the world economy is growing. Saudi Arabian Oil
Co., the world’s biggest producer, stopped using WTI in January.  “WTI has proven itself over the last year to be a less-
than-ideal proxy for global oil demand,” said  Jason Schenker ,
president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based
consultant.  Short-Term Consolidation  Futures may drop as low as $71.50 a barrel in a short-term
consolidation period, according to technical indicators used by
traders to predict price movements.  Oil will fall toward intraday lows of $74.25 a barrel
reached on Sept. 7 and $73.10 on Aug. 31, said  Stephanie Aymes ,
a London-based cross-commodity technical analyst at Societe
Generale SA. The top range of crude’s consolidation is $76.25 a
barrel, which is close to the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the contract’s drop from its $83.91 high on Aug. 4 to $71.49
on Aug. 25.  Crude prices may drop next week on speculation that U.S.
inventories will climb as fuel demand declines, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  Seventeen of 30 analysts, or 57 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through Oct. 1. Nine respondents, or 30 percent,
predicted little change, and four estimated prices will rise.
Last week, 52 percent said crude would decrease.  To contact the reporters on this story:
