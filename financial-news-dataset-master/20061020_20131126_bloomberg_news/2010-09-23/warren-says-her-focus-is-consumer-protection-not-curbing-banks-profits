Elizabeth Warren , President  Barack Obama ’s new U.S. consumer-protection adviser, said she is
focused on making it easier for Americans to understand loan and
credit-card agreements, not on curbing banks’ profits.  “This is not about price controls,” she said on CNBC’s
“Squawk Box” today. “It’s really about saying, make clear
what it costs” and “let a consumer make a good, informed
decision.”  Warren, named by Obama to advise the new Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, said the agency would use the powers and
staffing of existing agencies to carry out its mission and not
be a new layer of bureaucracy.  “It scissors that responsibility” of protecting consumers
“from the seven other agencies, brings it into this one agency,
and will permit us to reduce the total amount of rules,” said
Warren, 61.  Warren’s appointment avoided what was expected to be a
battle with Republicans over her Senate confirmation to head the
agency because of what her critics see as her anti-business
views.  Republican Representatives  Darrell Issa  of California and
 Spencer Bachus  of Alabama, in a letter to White House Counsel
 Robert Bauer , have questioned whether “the president bypassed
the Senate confirmation process” with the appointment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
