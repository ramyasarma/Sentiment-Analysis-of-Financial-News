Billionaire investor  Rakesh Jhunjhunwala  said he is “cautious” as this months 11 percent
gain in India’s benchmark stock index may have been excessive
even as he predicts further gains.  “At the moment, I surely see a probability of a market
which is going to go up,” Jhunjhunwala said in an interview
with Bloomberg UTV channel today. “But since the rise has been
very rapid in the last 15 to 20 days, we also need to be
cautious.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex , has
climbed 24 percent from its May 25 low, helping it breach 20,000
this week for the first time since January 2008. The measure
advanced 11 percent this month, making it the best performer
among benchmark indexes in the world’s 10 largest stock markets.  Foreign fund inflows to India’s equities have increased 61
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China. The 14-day  relative strength index  of the main
stock gauge has exceeded the 70 level, which some investors view
as a signal to sell, for the past two weeks.  “The Indian economy and the Indian growth story is on a
continuous uphill climb,” he said. “I think it is good to be
bullish in bullish times.” He advised investors to “never try
to time markets” and “continuously invest month to month.”  Jhunjhunwala was named by Forbes magazine as the Warren
Buffett of India after he turned a $100 investment into $1
billion over two decades.  “There will always be cloud and always be doubt,” he
said. “In the next nine to 12 months at least, I don’t think
anything seriously going to go wrong in the Western world.”  The Sensex fell 0.4 percent to 19,861.01 at the 3:30 p.m.
