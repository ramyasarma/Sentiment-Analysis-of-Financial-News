Gold traded near a record as the
dollar slumped on prospects for a further easing of monetary
policy by the U.S. central bank to safeguard the economic
recovery. Silver reached a 30-month high before declining.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.2 percent
to $1,293.52 an ounce, before trading little changed at
$1,291.22 at 1:32 p.m. in Singapore. Bullion, set for a 10th
annual gain, reached a record $1,296.30 yesterday.  The Federal Reserve this week indicated it’s prepared to
pump more money into the U.S. economy, helping to weaken the
dollar and driving precious metals higher. The  Dollar Index , a
six-currency gauge of the dollar’s value, touched the lowest
level yesterday since March 17.  “With the prospect of quantitative easing coming on board,
money is flowing into riskier assets, such as commodities,”
said  Justin Smirk , chief economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in
Sydney. “Gold is benefiting from demand for a safe haven and
also getting pushed along by higher commodities prices.”  The  dollar  traded little changed today against the six-
currency basket before a report that may show existing U.S. home
sales were near the lowest in 10 years, backing the case for the
Federal Reserve to keep borrowing costs low.  The Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate at zero to
0.25 percent and purchased mortgage-backed securities and
Treasuries to bolster the world’s biggest economy.  Silver’s Rise  Spot silver fell as much as 0.5 percent to $21.0425 an
ounce after earlier rising to $21.2225, the highest price since
March 2008. The metal, which, traded at $21.1063 an ounce at
1:31 p.m. in Singapore, may climb to the highest price since
1980, said Smirk, referring to an increase to more than $21.355.  “Silver is rising alongside gold: that said, gold does
look expensive compared to silver,” said  Geoff Clear , head of
Asia commodities at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
“Weakness in the U.S. economy and now talk of quantitative
easing has increased demand.”  Silver has beaten gold in the past month, gaining about 17
percent compared with the yellow metal’s 5.3 percent climb, on
investor demand for a cheaper haven. An ounce of gold  bought  as
little as 60.88 ounces of silver today, the smallest amount
since January, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Silver doubles as a store of value for investors concerned
that the recovery may falter, hurting currencies, and as a raw
material for industry. Holdings in the iShares Silver Trust, the
biggest exchange-traded fund backed by silver, rose yesterday to
9,509.55 metric tons, the highest level since reaching a record
9,514.35 tons in December.  Silver traded at more than $49 an ounce in 1980, according
to Bloomberg data, after the Hunt brothers hoarded the metal.
Commerzbank AG forecast in June that silver, dubbed as “gold’s
little brother,” may surge to as much as $23 next year on
increased investment and industrial demand.  Among other precious metals, platinum for immediate
delivery gained as much as 0.4 percent to $1,640.38 an ounce,
the highest price since May 19, before trading at $1,636.35.
Palladium was little changed at $546.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
