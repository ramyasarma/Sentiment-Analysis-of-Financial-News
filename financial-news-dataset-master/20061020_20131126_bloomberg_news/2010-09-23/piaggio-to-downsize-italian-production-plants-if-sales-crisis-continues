Piaggio & C. SpA Chairman Roberto
Colaninno said the scootermaker may “downsize” its Italian
plants if the sales crisis continues, speaking at a press
conference in Milan today.  The company plans to close its factory in Spain, he added.
Sales in Italy are “still very difficult,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
