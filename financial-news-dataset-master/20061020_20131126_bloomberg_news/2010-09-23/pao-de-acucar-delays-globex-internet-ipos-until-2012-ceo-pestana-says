Grupo Pao de Acucar , Brazil’s largest retailer, is delaying
plans to sell shares in its e-commerce and electronics units
until 2012, Chief Executive Officer  Eneas Pestana  said.  Pao de Acucar, based in Sao Paulo, had planned to sell
shares in the Internet unit and Globex Utilidades SA as early as
the second half of 2010. The retailer wants to focus on
integrating its operations after  making acquisitions , Pestana
said at an event in Sao Paulo today.  Pao de Acucar wants to postpone the share sales until it
“get results” after buying Globex in June 2009 to take over
the Ponto Frio electronics chain and agreeing in December to buy
Casa Bahia Comercial Ltda., Pestana said. He said integrating
the companies’ operations will probably take more than eight
months.  “In 2011, we’ll be focusing on the integration of the two
platforms,” Pestana told journalists today. “Selling shares
with such a strong upward curve of results doesn’t make sense.
We want to take a company to market with significant upsides to
be had, but not at the level they’re at now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
