Ghana’s  government signed a $10.4
billion concessionary-loan agreement with  Export-Import Bank of
China  for the development of rail, road and energy
infrastructure in the West African nation.  An accord was signed in Beijing on the third day of a five-
day visit to China by Ghanaian President  John Atta Mills , the
government said on its  website . The loan will be repaid over 20
years, it said.  The facility is the second to be announced during the
Ghanaian president’s visit to China, following a $3 billion
loan-accord signed with the China Development Bank for the
development of Ghana’s energy industry, the statement shows.  “The total facility so far clinched amounts to $14
billion, including a $260 million package for expansion works
projects and $150 million for Ghana’s e-governance project,”
and a grant of 100 million yuan ($15 million), it said.  Ghana will become Africa’s newest oil producer later this
year when crude starts flowing from the offshore Jubilee oil
field in December. Output is expected to total 120,000 barrels a
day by 2011.  Mills also signed an agreement with the Bosai Minerals
Group that will enable the Chinese mining company to spend $1.2
billion building an alumina refinery in Ghana, the  Ghanaian
Times  reported today. The funds will be invested in Ghana
Bauxite Co., of which Bosai owns 80 percent, the Accra-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
