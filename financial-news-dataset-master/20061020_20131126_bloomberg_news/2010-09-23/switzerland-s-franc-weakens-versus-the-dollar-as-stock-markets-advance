The Swiss franc strengthened
against the euro after growth in Europe’s manufacturing
industries weakened for a second month, fueling concern the
region’s economic recovery is losing steam and boosting demand
for the currency as a haven.  The franc snapped two days of declines after a  composite
index  based on a survey of euro-area purchasing managers in both
services and manufacturing fell to 53.8 from 56.2 in August,
London-based Markit Economics said today. Economists expected a
reading of 55.7, according to the median of 15 forecasts in a
 Bloomberg News survey . The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  fell as much
as 1.2 percent to 258.14, its lowest level in over three weeks.  “The euro is coming under pressure and is having a bit of
a correction back as the PMIs from the eurozone were much weaker
than expected,” said  Ian Stannard , a currency strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in London. “The Swiss franc will continue to perform
well as currency flows into the country remain very strong, and
there is little sign of the authorities having the appetite to
counterbalance that. We now expect a move back towards the lows
we saw earlier in the week.”  The franc appreciated 0.7 percent against the euro to
1.3127 as of 4:50 p.m. in London. The franc reached a record
1.2766 per euro on Sept. 8.  The franc also climbed against the dollar for the fifth day
after applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly
rose last week, a sign companies remain cautious about hiring as
economic growth slows. Initial jobless claims increased by
12,000 to 465,000 in the week ended Sept. 18, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington.  The franc strengthened as much as 0.6 percent to 98.05
centimes per dollar, the strongest level since a record of 97.86
centimes in March 2008, and traded later at 98.42 centimes.  Investors traditionally buy the franc during times of
economic turmoil because of the perceived stability of
Switzerland’s economy and its current account surplus, and
offload their holdings of the currency when they want to take on
more risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
