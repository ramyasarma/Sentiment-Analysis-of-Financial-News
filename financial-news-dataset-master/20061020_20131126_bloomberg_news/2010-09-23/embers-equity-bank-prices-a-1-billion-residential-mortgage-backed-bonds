Members Equity Bank Pty Ltd., the
Australian lender known as ME Bank, issued A$1 billion of bonds
backed by residential mortgages, according to an e-mailed
statement from Westpac Banking Corp., which helped manage the
sale.  The lender priced the main class of notes, which totaled
A$645 million and had a weighted average life of about 1.5
years, to yield 100 basis points more than the one month bank
bill swap rate, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
