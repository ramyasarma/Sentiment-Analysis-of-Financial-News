Australia’s dollar may trade at a
one-for-one basis with its U.S. counterpart for the first time
by the end of the year as economic growth accelerates and the
Federal Reserve adds to easing measures, BNP Paribas SA said.  The Aussie, as the South Pacific nation’s currency is
known, may gain to $1.02 by the end of the year as the Fed
reintroduces quantitative easing, or the large-scale purchase of
debt, and as the Bank of Japan steps in to sell yen to curb its
currency’s strength. The Aussie may also benefit as policy
makers bolster domestic demand in China, its largest trading
partner.  “Countries which export raw materials to China will remain
supported and Australia remains at the top of this list.” BNP
analysts led by  Paul Mortimer-Lee  in London wrote in a note to
clients.  The Aussie dropped 0.6 percent to 95.11 U.S. cents at 11:03
a.m. in New York. It last approached parity in July 2008, when
it traded at 98.50, the highest level since it was freely
floated in 1983.  Australia’s  economy  expanded 1.2 percent in the second
quarter, more than forecast, signaling the Reserve Bank of
Australia may resume increasing  interest rate s as early as its
next meeting on Oct. 4, BNP said. The central bank has left the
benchmark lending rate unchanged since it increased it by 0.25
percent to 4.5 percent in April.  BNP last month forecast the Aussie to end the year at 90
U.S. cents. The median estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg
News is for the currency to trade at 88 cents by year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
