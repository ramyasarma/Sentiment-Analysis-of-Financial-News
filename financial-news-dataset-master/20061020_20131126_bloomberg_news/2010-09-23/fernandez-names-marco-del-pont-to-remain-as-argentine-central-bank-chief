Argentine central bank President
 Mercedes Marco del Pont , who backed the government’s use of
international reserves to pay debt, was nominated to remain in
her post.  Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
designated the Yale-trained economist to keep running the bank
until a Senate vote on her nomination, according to a statement
on the presidential  website . Marco del Pont, 51, took office in
February to finish the mandate of  Martin Redrado , whom Fernandez
fired for opposing her plan to pay creditors with  reserves ,
currently at a record $51.2 billion.  Marco del Pont’s first action as central banker was to
transfer more than $6.6 billion to the Treasury to pay debt due
this year, $4.7 billion of which has been spent, according to
Economy Minister Amado Boudou. The former lawmaker with the
ruling Victory Front coalition was named to the post after
running state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina.  “Marco del Pont has shown sufficient submission to the
executive branch to continue in her post,” said  Aldo Abram ,
head of research company Exante SA, in a Sept. 21 telephone
interview. “She doesn’t follow the bank’s charter but she acts
in line with what she believes.”  In a March 4 televised speech, Fernandez described Marco
del Pont as “a respected economist with personal, academic,
political and professional aptitudes.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
