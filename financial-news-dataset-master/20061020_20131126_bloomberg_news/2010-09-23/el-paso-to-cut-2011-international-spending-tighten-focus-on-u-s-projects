El Paso Corp. , the owner of the
largest U.S. network of interstate natural-gas pipelines, plans
to reduce spending on international exploration and production
in 2011 to focus on U.S. output.  El Paso estimates 2010 investments in Brazil and Egypt, the
company’s only international markets, at $200 million,  Bruce L. Connery , a spokesman, said today in a telephone interview from
Houston. El Paso’s total production rose 1.4 percent to 788
million cubic feet a day of gas equivalent in the second
quarter.  The company plans to put one rig next year in the Texas
Wolfcamp oil-shale play, Connery also said. El Paso won a bid
for 123,100 acres in Reagan, Crockett, Upton and Irion counties,
according to a company statement today.  As of Aug. 4, El Paso has four rigs in the Haynesville
shale formation, two in Eagle Ford and two in Altamont.  El Paso fell 15 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $12 as of 4 p.m.
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
