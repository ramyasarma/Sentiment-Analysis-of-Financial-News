Silver advanced to a 30-month high
as the dollar slumped on prospects for a further easing of
monetary policy by the U.S. central bank to safeguard the
economic recovery. Gold traded near a record.  Spot silver gained as much as 0.3 percent to $21.2225 an
ounce, the highest level since March 2008, before trading at
$21.1512 at 12:15 p.m. in Singapore. Gold was little changed at
$1,292.55 an ounce, after reaching a record $1,296.30 yesterday.  “With the prospect of quantitative easing coming on board,
money is flowing into riskier assets, such as commodities,”
said  Justin Smirk , chief economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in
Sydney. Silver may climb to the highest price since 1980, said
Smirk, referring to an increase to more than $21.355 an ounce.  The Federal Reserve this week indicated it’s prepared to
pump more money into the U.S. economy, helping to weaken the
dollar and driving precious metals higher. The  Dollar Index , a
six-currency gauge of the dollar’s value, touched the lowest
level yesterday since March 17.  Silver has beaten gold in the past month, gaining about 18
percent compared with the yellow metal’s 5.4 percent climb, on
investor demand for a cheaper haven. An ounce of gold  bought  as
little as 60.88 ounces of silver today, the smallest amount
since January, according to Bloomberg calculations.  ‘Increased Demand’  “Silver is rising alongside gold: that said, gold does
look expensive compared to silver,” said  Geoff Clear , head of
Asia commodities at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
“Weakness in the U.S. economy and now talk of quantitative
easing has increased demand.”  Silver traded at more than $49 an ounce in 1980, according
to Bloomberg data. Commerzbank AG forecast in June that the
metal, dubbed as “gold’s little brother,” may surge to as much
as $23 next year on increased investment and industrial demand.  Silver doubles as a store of value for investors concerned
that the recovery may falter, hurting currencies, and as a raw
material for industry. Holdings in the iShares Silver Trust, the
biggest exchange-traded fund backed by silver, rose yesterday to
9,509.55 metric tons, the highest level since reaching a record
9,514.35 tons in December.  “Silver does face a dilemma if the outlook for the economy
is poor” because of its industrial applications, which include
batteries, said Clear. “There are still people out there who
buy silver to keep as an investment, and as long as gold
continues to rally, silver will find that support.”  Borrowing Costs  The  dollar  traded little changed today against the six-
currency basket before a report that may show existing U.S. home
sales were near the lowest in 10 years, backing the case for the
Federal Reserve to keep borrowing costs low.  The Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate at zero to
0.25 percent and purchased mortgage-backed securities and
Treasuries to bolster the world’s biggest economy.  The U.S. central bank will continue to monitor the economic
outlook and is “prepared to provide additional accommodation if
needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation,
over time, to levels consistent with its mandate,” the Federal
Open Market Committee said Sept. 21.  Among other precious metals, platinum for immediate
delivery gained as much as 0.4 percent to $1,640.38 an ounce,
the highest price since May 19, before trading at $1,636.75.
Palladium dropped 0.3 percent to $544.85 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
