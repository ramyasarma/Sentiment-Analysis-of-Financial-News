India’s  10-year bond yields  held at
their lowest level in two weeks on speculation banks will
increase debt purchases to meet the central bank’s reserve
requirement rules.  Indian banks must hold a quarter of their  deposits  in
government bonds. Deposits rose 14.4 percent from a year earlier
to a record 46.7 trillion rupees ($1 trillion) as of Aug. 27,
according to data published by the Reserve Bank of India. The
government will finalize the borrowing calendar for the second
half of the fiscal year ending in March today, a  finance
ministry  official, who declined to be identified, said yesterday.  “Demand from banks to meet the statutory liquidity ratio
needs is likely to increase,” said  Krishnamurthy Harihar , a
treasurer at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. “I expect a token
reduction in the borrowing program.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 was little
changed at 7.94 percent as of 10.15 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
the central bank’s trading system. The price was at 99.07 per
100 rupee face amount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
