The pound may be the worst-
performing currency of the Group of 10 nations through the end
of next year as the government cuts spending and the central
bank expands asset purchases, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  “Aggressive fiscal tightening, along with household and
bank deleveraging evident in a softening housing market and
consumer demand, likely will compel the Bank of England to
implement further quantitative easing,” JPMorgan strategists
led by  Gabriel de Kock  in New York, wrote in an investor note
dated yesterday. “With Bank of England policy relegating the
pound to funding-currency status,” sterling may depreciate to
88 pence per euro by June and drop to $1.47 by the end of 2011,
the analysts wrote.  The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.5690 and strengthened 0.6
percent to 85.03 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
