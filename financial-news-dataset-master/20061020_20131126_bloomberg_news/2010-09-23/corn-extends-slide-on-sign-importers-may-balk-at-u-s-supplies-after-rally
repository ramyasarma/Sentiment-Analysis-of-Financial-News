Corn fell the most in a month as a
drop in export sales by the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
shipper, signaled importers are balking at prices that reached
the highest level in 23 months.  Export sales  for delivery in the year that began Sept. 1
fell 3.8 percent to 561,812 metric tons in the week ended Sept.
16 from a week earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today. It was the smallest total in seven weeks for grain
earmarked for the current marketing year. Before this week, corn
prices jumped 37 percent since the end of June.  “Export sales were disappointing for a second straight
week,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “Buyers are starting
to back away to wait for lower prices.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 1.1
percent, to close at $4.9925 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since Aug. 24. On Sept. 20, the price reached $5.2375,
the highest level since Sept. 30, 2008.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
