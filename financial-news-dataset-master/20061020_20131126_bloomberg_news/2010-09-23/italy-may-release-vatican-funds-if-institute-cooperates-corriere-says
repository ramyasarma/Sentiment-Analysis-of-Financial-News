Italian prosecutors probing Vatican
Bank executives for possible money-laundering violations may
unfreeze 23 million euros ($31 million) in seized funds if the
institute reveals who the cash was intended for, Corriere della
Sera reported, without saying how it got the information.  Prosecutors have already spoken with executives at  Credito
Artigiano SpA , the lender the Vatican Bank used for the
transactions, Corriere said. They may also question Vatican Bank
chief  Ettore Gotti Tedeschi , the newspaper said.  The Holy See said in a Sept. 21 statement that the sums
“are cash transactions with non-Italian credit institutions,
the beneficiary of which is the IOR itself.” The Vatican Bank’s
official name is the Institute for Works of Religion, or IOR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
