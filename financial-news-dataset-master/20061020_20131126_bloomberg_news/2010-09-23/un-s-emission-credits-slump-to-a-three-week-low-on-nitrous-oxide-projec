United Nations emission offsets
dropped to their lowest level in three weeks after regulators
yesterday issued more credits to projects than on any day since
Nov. 16.  UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for December
dropped 2.1 percent to 13.22 euros ($17.71) as of 12:27 p.m. on
London’s European Climate Exchange. European Union allowances
for December fell 1.1 percent to 14.87 euros.  Regulators of the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism, the
world’s second-largest carbon market,  yesterday issued  6.4
million credits, including 5.98 million tons to a PetroChina Co.
project that decomposes nitrous oxide.  “It’s a hard chunk to swallow,” said  Emmanuel Fages , a
Paris-based analyst with Orbeo, the carbon-trading venture of
Societe Generale SA and Rhodia SA.  Credits have jumped 20 percent this year as utilities seek
supply and regulators increase scrutiny of projects. The offsets
can be used in EU carbon market, the world’s biggest emission
trading place, where allowances have risen 19 percent in the
same period.  Regulators have supplied a weekly average of about 1.8
million tons in CERS this year, said  Marisa Beck , a Bloomberg New
Energy Finance analyst in London. The discount of CERs over EU
allowances, traded as a separate contract, widened 7.8 percent
to 1.66 euros a ton today, its biggest gap since Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
