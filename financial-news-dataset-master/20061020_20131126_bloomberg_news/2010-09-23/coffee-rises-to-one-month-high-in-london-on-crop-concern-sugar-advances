Coffee futures climbed on concern
that a lack of rain will reduce crop prospects in Brazil, the
world’s largest producer. Sugar and cocoa gained.  Brazil had dry weather since April and needs rain this
month as coffee trees start flowering to produce beans for next
year’s harvest. In the seven days starting Sept. 30, as much as
200 millimeters (7.9 inches) of rain may fall, said  Expedito Rebello , the head of research at the government’s Meteorology
Institute, known as Inmet.  “We had a dry weather pattern which was very, very
worrisome for some people,” said  Rodrigo Costa , the vice
president of institutional sales at Newedge USA LLC in New
York. “The market is waiting for a confirmation that we’re
going to see rains in a regular way that usually takes place
from October on.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery advanced 0.7 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $1.8065 a pound at 10:16 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Before today, the commodity jumped 32 percent
this year.  Robusta-coffee futures for November delivery gained $18, or
1.1 percent, to $1,714 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.
Earlier, the price reached $1,727, the highest level for a most-
active contract since Aug. 24.  “Unrest persists on the coffee market,” Commerzbank AG
said in a report. “We are seeing daily changes in the key
estimates of the impact of the drought in Brazil and whether the
forecast rainfall will be enough to prevent substantial damage
to the crops.”  Brazil Forecast  Brazil may harvest 47.2 million bags this year, more than
last year’s 39.5 million bags, as trees entered the higher-
yielding half of a two-year cycle, the Agriculture Ministry’s
forecasting agency said on Sept. 9.  Crops in Brazil may be hurt by hail next week as a cold-
weather front approaches major producing regions, Inmet’s
Rebello said.  Refined-sugar futures for December delivery rose $3, or 0.5
percent, to $610 a ton in London. Raw-sugar futures for March
delivery rose 0.05 cent, or 0.2 percent, to 23.24 cents a pound
in New York.  Cocoa futures for December delivery gained $23, or 0.8
percent, to $2,785 a ton in New York.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery was little
changed at 1,887 pounds ($2,960) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
