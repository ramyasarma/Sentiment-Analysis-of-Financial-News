Gerdau SA, Latin America’s largest
steelmaker, plans to sell $1.25 billion of bonds that mature in
2021 to yield 5.875 percent, according to a person familiar with
the transaction.  The company may sell the bonds as soon as today, said the
person, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.
HSBC Holdings Plc, Banco Santander SA and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
are underwriting the sale, according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
