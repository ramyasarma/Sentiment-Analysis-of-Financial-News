ThyssenKrupp AG has resolved “with
immediate effect not to enter into any new contracts with
Iranian customers,” it said in an e-mailed statement, adding
that it was complying with the sanctions policies of Germany,
the European Union and the United States.  The policy “prohibits all new business” with Iran and
“goes beyond the current sanctions measures, which relate
primarily to the petroleum sector, the company said. ‘‘Existing
group interests in Iran are to be terminated as quickly as
possible,’’ the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
