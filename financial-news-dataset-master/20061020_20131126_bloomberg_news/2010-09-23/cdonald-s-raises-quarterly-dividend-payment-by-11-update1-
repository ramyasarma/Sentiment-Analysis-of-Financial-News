McDonald’s Corp.  raised its
quarterly cash  dividend  11 percent to 61 cents a share as the
company boosted sales 88 months straight even in the weak
economy.  The 6-cent increase indicates the world’s largest
restaurant chain has the cash flow to cover growth initiatives
such as new stores in Asia and remodeling programs in the  U.S.
and Europe ,  Tom Forte , analyst with Telsey Advisory Group in New
York, said in a telephone interview.  “The state of their business is very strong,” Forte said.
“The company remains confident that it will continue to take
market share in this still-challenging consumer environment.”  The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company last increased its
quarterly dividend a year ago, to 55 cents from 50 cents.  The dividend payout will be approximately $650 million, the
company said. McDonald’s will pay investors about $5 billion in
dividends and share buybacks in 2010, Chief Executive Officer
 Jim Skinner  said in a statement today.  McDonald’s fell 49 cents to $74.64 at 4:02 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The  shares  have gained
20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
