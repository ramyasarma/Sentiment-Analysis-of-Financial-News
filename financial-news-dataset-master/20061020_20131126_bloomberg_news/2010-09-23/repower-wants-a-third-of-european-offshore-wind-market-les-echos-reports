Repower Systems AG  aims for a one-
third share of the European offshore wind-energy market and will
compete for a French government turbine contract, Les Echos
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer
 Andreas Nauen .  The global wind-turbine industry is producing 15 percent
more equipment than is needed, creating a “buyer’s market,”
the newspaper cited Nauen as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
