KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer, rose the most in three weeks as Citizen TV reported
that a dispute over processing fees between the company and
Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd. was resolved.  The stock advanced 20 cents, or 2.2 percent, to 9.45
shillings, the highest since Sept. 2, at the 3 p.m. close in
Nairobi, the capital.  KenolKobil was today allowed to resume processing crude oil
at the East African nation’s sole refinery, Citizen, a closely
held broadcaster, said on its  website , citing government
officials it didn’t identify.  KenolKobil said on Sept. 6 it wants arbitrators to review
increases that KPRL, as the refinery is also known, introduced
in 2006 and 2008 and that the company has refused to pay.
KenolKobil said July 19 the refinery is holding more than 4
billion shillings ($49.3 million) of its refined fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
