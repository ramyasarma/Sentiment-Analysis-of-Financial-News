U.S. airlines must determine
whether  Koito Industries Ltd.  seats on 278 planes meet safety
standards and remove those that don’t, aviation regulators said.  The  order , which covers 40,365 seats on planes made by
companies such as  Airbus SAS  and  Boeing Co. , would cost about
$875,000, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The
agency is scheduled to publish the directive tomorrow.  Koito may have to fix as many as 150,000 seats in about
1,000 aircraft owned by 32 airlines after falsifying tests and
making unauthorized design changes, Japan’s transport ministry
said Feb. 8. The European Aviation Safety Agency last year
withdrew approval for the Yokohama, Japan-based company’s seats.  Airbus and Boeing have said some aircraft deliveries were
delayed because of the need to make safety checks of the seats.  Carriers must replace seats, or parts of them, within
either six years or two to three years, depending on the types
of flaws found in inspections, according to the FAA order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
