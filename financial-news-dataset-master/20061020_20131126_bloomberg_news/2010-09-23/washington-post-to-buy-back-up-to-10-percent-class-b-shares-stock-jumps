Washington Post Co. , the namesake
owner of the fifth-largest U.S. newspaper by circulation, said
it plans to buy back as many as 750,000 Class B shares.  The amount is about 10 percent of the Class B stock
outstanding and includes 16,312 shares that remained under a
previous buyback authorization. Post Co. didn’t give a price
ceiling or time limit for the purchases in its statement today.  Post Co. has been moving to limit losses from its media
units, which include newspapers and Newsweek magazine, as
readers turn to Web publications, where stories are updated more
frequently. It agreed this year to sell Newsweek, which lost
$2.3 million in the first quarter, and has trimmed sections at
the Washington Post.  Post Co. shares  jumped  $15.53, or 4.3 percent, to $375.75
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They
have lost 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
