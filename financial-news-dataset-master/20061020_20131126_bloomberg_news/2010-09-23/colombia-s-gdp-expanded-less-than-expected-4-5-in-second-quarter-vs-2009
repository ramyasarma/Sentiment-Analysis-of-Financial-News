Colombia’s economy expanded at the
fastest pace since 2007 in the second quarter as the global
credit crunch eased and local demand for household goods boosted
manufacturing.  Gross domestic product  rose  4.5 percent from a year ago,
lower than the 5.5 percent median forecast from 31 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The economy grew 1 percent from the prior
 quarter , according to the statistics  agency .  “Domestic demand is a really strong component driving the
economy right now,” said  Andres Jimenez , international sales
director at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage.
“People feel confident that the economy is growing, that they
have money in their pockets, and so they are spending.”  Annual growth was led by a 14.9 percent pickup in mining
activity, 8.4 percent in manufacturing, and 4.2 percent in
transport and communications. Construction fell 5.6 percent.  President  Juan Manuel Santos , who took office Aug. 7, has
pledged to increase spending on public works such as roads and
bridges to help accelerate annual economic growth to 6 percent a
year and create 2.4 million jobs.  “Investors may begin to ask how long growth can be
maintained like this without causing inflationary pressure,”
said  Jimena Zuniga , a Latin America economist at Barclay’s Plc
in New York. “We think inflation will not put the central bank
against the wall soon. Growth will remain solid, but we think
that the quarters of highest sequential growth are behind us.”  Inflation Estimates  The  central bank  has said inflation this year is in line
with its estimate of 2 percent to 4 percent, although it may
increase next year. Annual inflation rose 2.31 percent in August
and 0.11 percent from the previous month.  “It’s important the central bank starts to consider
economic growth at 5.5 percent for next year in its analysis,
because that is inflationary growth, so we could see an increase
in interest rates next year,” said Citigroup Inc. economist
 Munir Jalil  in Bogota.  The central bank meets tomorrow to decide on the benchmark
lending rate. All 30 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg expect the
board to leave the overnight rate at a record low of 3 percent
for a fifth month.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell 0.028 percentage point to 7.265 at 1:15 p.m. New York
time, according to Colombia’s stock exchange.  The  peso  fell 0.5 percent to 1,811.73 per dollar from
1,803.18 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
