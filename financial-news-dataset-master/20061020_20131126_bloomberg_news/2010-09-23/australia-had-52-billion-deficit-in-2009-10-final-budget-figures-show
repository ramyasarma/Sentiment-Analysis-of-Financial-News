Australia’s budget deficit in the
year to June 30 was less than forecast four months earlier due
to lower spending, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said today.  The government said the shortfall was A$54.8 billion ($51.9
billion) in 2009-10, compared with the A$57.1 billion forecast
in the May budget. The smaller deficit reflected lower interest
costs and under-spending on government programs, Swan said.  “The government remains committed to its strict spending
limits and fiscal strategy, which will see us return the budget
to surplus in 2012-13, comfortably ahead of any major advanced
economy,” the treasurer said in a statement in Canberra.  The Treasury  document  released today said economic growth
in Australia is “now strengthening and tax receipts are
recovering.” The government projected a deficit of A$40.7
billion this year, narrowing to A$10.4 billion in 2011-12, and a
surplus of A$3.5 billion the following year, according to
figures released before the Aug. 21 election.  That ballot was the closest in seven decades and forced
Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  to form a minority government.  Her political partners, independent lawmakers  Robert Oakeshott ,  Tony Windsor  and  Andrew Wilkie , and Greens Party
member  Adam Bandt  pledged support for budget measures over the
next three years, without endorsing Labor’s broader legislative
agenda. The deal risks slowing the passage through parliament of
laws such as Gillard’s planned mining tax.  The new parliament will start on Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
