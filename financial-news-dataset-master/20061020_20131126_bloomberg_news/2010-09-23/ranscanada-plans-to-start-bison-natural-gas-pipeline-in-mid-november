TransCanada Corp.  expects the Bison
natural-gas pipeline project to be in service by mid-November, a
company executive said today.  “One of the two meter stations is under construction now
and we continue to push for that Nov. 15 on-stream date,” Dean
Ferguson, vice president of western U.S. pipelines at
TransCanada, said at the Platts Pipeline Development and
Expansion conference in Houston.  TranCanada’s Bison Pipeline Project, a 30-inch interstate
conduit that runs more than 300 miles (483 kilometers), will
move gas from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming to markets in
the U.S. Midwest.  The pipeline is projected to have a capacity of about 477
million cubic feet a day with the potential to be expanded to
about 1 billion cubic feet a day, according to the company’s
 website .  Calgary-based TransCanada is the sole owner of the Bison
pipeline system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
