David Villa  scored the only goal as
Barcelona beat Sporting Gijon to move to within a point of the
leaders in Spanish soccer’s Primera Division.  Villa’s 49th-minute goal at the Nou Camp last night lifted
the defending champion to third in the standings with nine
points behind Real Madrid and Valencia, which missed the chance
to go clear at the top by drawing 1-1 with Atletico Madrid.  In Italy, Inter Milan’s  Diego Milito  and  Samuel Eto’o  each
scored twice in a 4-0 home win over Bari that took the defending
champion top with 10 points after four games. Brescia and Chievo
are a point back following victories last night.  Cesena, which was top on goal difference at the start of
the evening, conceded for the first time since being promoted in
a 2-0 defeat at Catania that dropped it to fifth place.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
