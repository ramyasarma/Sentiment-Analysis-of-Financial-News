The euro dropped from almost a
five-month high against the dollar as growth in Europe’s
services and manufacturing industries slowed this month more
than economists forecast.  The 16-nation currency fell versus most of its major
counterparts on concern the region’s recovery is losing
momentum. The franc strengthened against the euro as a drop in
stocks boosted demand for the Swiss currency as a haven.  “The data has been on the soft side of expectations pretty
much across the board, and that’s not helping,” said  Adam Cole ,
London-based global head of currency strategy at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit. “Longer-term, the dynamic is
negative for the euro.”  The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.3328 at 7:32 a.m. in New
York, from $1.3406 yesterday, when it advanced to $1.3440, the
highest level since April 21. The euro depreciated 0.5 percent
to 112.70 yen, from 113.27. The dollar traded at 84.53 yen,
compared with 84.50 yen yesterday, when it dropped to 84.28, the
lowest level since Japan’s intervention on Sept. 15. That day
the yen reached a 15-year high.  A  composite index  based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both services and manufacturing fell to 53.8 from
56.2 in August, London-based Markit Economics said today. The
median forecast of 15 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a reading of 55.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The franc rose for the first time in three days against the
euro, appreciating 0.5 percent to 1.3151.  Falling Stocks  European stocks erased earlier gains, leaving the benchmark
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index  0.5 percent weaker after rising as much
as 0.7 percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in
December dropped 0.7 percent.  Sterling was little changed at $1.5682 after a report
showed mortgage approvals in the U.K. fell in August to a 16-
month low. The pound remained stronger versus the euro, trading
at 85.06 pence.  Home loans granted by lenders to buy properties dropped to
31,767 from a revised 34,219 in July, the London-based British
Bankers’ Association said in an e-mailed statement today. The
reading is down 22 percent from a year earlier.  The pound may be the worst-performing currency of the Group
of 10 nations through the end of next year as the government
cuts spending and the central bank expands asset purchases,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  “Aggressive fiscal tightening, along with household and
bank deleveraging evident in a softening housing market and
consumer demand, likely will compel the Bank of England to
implement further quantitative easing,” JPMorgan strategists
led by  Gabriel de Kock  in New York, wrote in an investor note
dated yesterday.  Pound Outlook  Sterling may depreciate to 88 pence per euro by June and
drop to $1.47 by the end of 2011, the analysts wrote.  New Zealand’s dollar dropped for the first time in five
days as a report showed the economy grew less in the second
quarter than economists predicted.  Gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent from the prior
three months, Statistics New Zealand said. The median forecast
of 12 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase
of 0.7 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar slumped 1.5 percent to 72.75 U.S.
cents and slid 1.6 percent to 61.42 yen.  The U.S. currency was little changed versus the yen before
an industry report forecast to show sales of existing homes were
close to the weakest in 10 years.  Sales of existing  U.S. homes  rose 7.1 percent in August to
an annual rate of 4.1 million, behind only July’s 3.83 million
pace as the weakest in a decade’s worth of data, according to
median forecast of 72 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
report from the National Association of Realtors is due at 10
a.m. New York time.  “The data has been disappointing and the Fed will have to
resort to quantitative easing,” said  Neil Jones , head of
European hedge fund sales at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in
London. “There’s momentum to sell the dollar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
