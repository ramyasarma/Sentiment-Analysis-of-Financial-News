Kenya’s  Nairobi Stock Exchange 
plans to start a new market targeting small businesses within 12
months, Head of Market and Product Development Donald Ouma said.  “We have formed a technical committee with the Capital
Markets Authority to develop the segment,” Ouma said in an e-
mailed response to questions by Bloomberg News from Nairobi.  The listing criteria for the new market will be developed
after studying regulations in countries with similar markets, he
said. The study by the exchange will focus on the  Johannesburg
Stock Exchange’s AltX , the London Stock Exchange’s  Alternative
Investment Market , Bursa Malaysia’s  ACE Market  and the Stock
Exchange of Mauritius’  Development and Enterprise Market , he
said.  Kenya’s bourse plans to double the number of listed
companies over the next two years by “demystify the process of
raising medium- to long-term capital through the NSE and working
with the Capital Markets Authority to simplify the process,
without compromising on the quality of disclosures,” Ouma said.
The Nairobi All-Share Index, which has risen 43 percent this
year, is the second-best performing measure in Africa after
 Uganda’s index , which has surged 51 percent.  The East African nation has a fixed-income securities
market that deals in bonds, while the Main Investment Market is
for companies with a minimum share capital of 50 million
shillings ($616,000) and assets worth 100 million shillings. The
Alternative Investment Market is for companies with a minimum
share capital of 20 million shillings and a similar amount in
assets, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
