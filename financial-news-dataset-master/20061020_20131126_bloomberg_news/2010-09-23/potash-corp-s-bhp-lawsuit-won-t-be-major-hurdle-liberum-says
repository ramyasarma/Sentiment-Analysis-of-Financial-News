Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ’s
lawsuit filed against BHP Billiton Ltd. yesterday is
unlikely to be a major hurdle for the Australian mining
company’s $40 billion  bid , according to Liberum Capital Ltd.  “We see little substance to the lawsuit and to us seems
suggestive of a dearth of emerging ‘white knights,’” London-
based Liberum analysts said today in an e-mailed note. “While
it may delay the bid process for a period, we do not envisage
this becoming a major hurdle.”  Potash Corp., the world’s biggest  producer  of the crop
nutrient, sued Melbourne-based BHP in a Chicago federal
court, alleging BHP made “false and misleading” statements,
according to the complaint.  BHP  said the lawsuit is “entirely
without merit,” adding that it doesn’t expect the court filing
to interfere with or delay its all-cash offer.  Potash  rejected the $130-a-share offer from BHP last
month and said it had started talks with third parties. BHP
Chief Executive Officer  Marius Kloppers  has been in Canada this
week and has met with lawmakers to discuss the plan.  The Canadian company is seeking a 60-day freeze on BHP
taking any further steps to acquire it, until “misleading
statements to the market have dissipated and shareholders have
had the opportunity to review and consider the corrective
disclosures,” according to the lawsuit.  The case is Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan v. BHP Billiton,
10-06024, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
