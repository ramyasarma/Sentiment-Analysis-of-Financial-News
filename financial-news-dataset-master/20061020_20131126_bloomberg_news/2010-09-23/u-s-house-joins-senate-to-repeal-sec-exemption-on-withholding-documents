The U.S. House of Representatives
voted to repeal language in the Dodd-Frank financial-regulation
law that was faulted for giving the Securities and Exchange
Commission too much power to withhold documents from the public.  The House approved the repeal today after the Senate voted
on a similar measure this week. Representative  Barney Frank ,
chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said his
chamber acted so President  Barack Obama  could enact removal of
the Freedom of Information Act exemption as quickly as possible.  “We decided that the best way to proceed was to concur
with the Senate so that the president could sign legislation
that solves the immediate problem,” Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat, said in a statement. “We have bipartisan agreement
that further action is necessary and we will begin that work.”  The financial overhaul law signed by Obama in July says the
SEC doesn’t have to release records gathered for “surveillance,
risk assessments, or other regulatory and oversight
activities.” Lawmakers criticized the SEC for seeking the FOIA
provision, saying the agency might use the authority to limit
transparency and hide regulatory failures.  SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro , testifying before Congress last
week, said her agency sought the measure to encourage money-
managers and brokerages to turn over documents during
inspections. Firm are sometimes hesitant to release information
out of concern that it will later be made public through a FOIA
request, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
