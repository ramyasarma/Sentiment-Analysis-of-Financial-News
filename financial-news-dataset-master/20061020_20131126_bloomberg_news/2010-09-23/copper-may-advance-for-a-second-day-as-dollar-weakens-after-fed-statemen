Copper rose to the highest price in
five months as stockpiles of the metal headed for the 31st
straight weekly drop.  Inventories  monitored by the London Metal Exchange are down
1.1 percent this week to 380,125 metric tons, the lowest level
since November. Prices extended gains after a report showed
sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose last month. Builders
are the biggest consumers of the metal used for pipes and
electrical wiring.  “Continued stock drawdowns mean the market is looking very
tight,” said  Gayle Berry , an analyst at Barclays Capital in
London. “Demand is very robust,” and prices may continue to
climb, she said.  Copper futures for delivery in December rose 2.55 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $3.5905 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price touched $3.595, the
highest level for a most-active contract since April 16.  Home resales  rose to a 4.13 million annual pace in August,
the National Association of Realtors said. Economists forecast a
4.1 million pace, the median of 72 projections in a Bloomberg
News survey. The U.S. is the world’s largest copper user after
China.  Futures gained 28 percent in the past year as Chinese
manufacturing increased.  “Copper is up on emerging market demand,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “Supply is
tight for copper, and LME stocks have been low.”  In London, the metal for delivery in three months rose $40,
or 0.5 percent, to $7,885 a ton ($3.58 a pound). Aluminum, tin,
zinc, nickel and lead also gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
