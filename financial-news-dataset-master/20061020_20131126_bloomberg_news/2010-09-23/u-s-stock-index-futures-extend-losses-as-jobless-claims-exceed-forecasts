U.S. stock-index futures extended
losses after initial jobless claims unexpectedly increased,
fueling concern the economic recovery is in jeopardy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December lost 1 percent 1,119 at 8:31 a.m. in New York. Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures decreased 79 points, or 0.7
percent, to 10,594.  Initial jobless claims  increased by 12,000 to 465,000 in
the week ended Sept. 18, Labor Department figures showed today
in Washington. The total number of people receiving unemployment
insurance declined, while those getting extended payments rose.  The S&P 500 slid 0.5 percent yesterday, the most since
Sept. 7, a day after the Federal Reserve said it’s willing to
ease monetary policy further to spur growth. The gauge has
gained 1.7 percent so far this year, leaving it 6.8 percent
below its peak for 2010.  European stocks dropped for a third day, led by bank and
construction shares, as concern intensified that countries on
the periphery of the euro area will fail to repay their debt.
Irish and Portuguese 10-year government bond yields widened to
records relative to similar-maturity benchmark German bunds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
