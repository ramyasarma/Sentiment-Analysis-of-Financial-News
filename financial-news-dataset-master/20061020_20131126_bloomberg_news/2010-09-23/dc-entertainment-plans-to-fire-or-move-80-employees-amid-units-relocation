DC Entertainment, the New York-
based comic-book division of  Time Warner Inc. , plans to fire or
relocate 80 employees amid an announced move of its multimedia
and digital-production businesses to California.  About a third of the unit’s estimated 250 employees will be
affected. The job changes, to take place between December 2010
and August 2011, were disclosed in a  filing  dated Sept. 22 with
the New York State Department of Labor.  “The reorganization of DC Entertainment includes
promotions, relocations and layoffs, and beyond that we are not
commenting on any specifics,” Paul McGuire, a spokesman for
Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner, said today in an e-mail.  DC Entertainment announced this week that it will transfer
its operations tied to film, TV, digital media, video games,
consumer products and administrative work to Burbank,
California, to work more closely with the Warner Bros. film
studio. The move is to be completed by the end of next year, the
company said.  The comic-book and graphic-novel publishing operations are
remaining in New York, DC Entertainment said.  The notice filed with New York state says that the affected
employees aren’t represented by a union.  Time Warner fell 49 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $30.76 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have gained 5.6 percent  this year .  To contact the reporter on this story:
