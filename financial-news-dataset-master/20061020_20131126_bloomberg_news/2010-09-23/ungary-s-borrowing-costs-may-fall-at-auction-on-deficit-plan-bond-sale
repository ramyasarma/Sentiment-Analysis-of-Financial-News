Hungary’s borrowing costs fell at a
debt sale today where investors bid for more than double the
amount offered after the government pledged to cut its 2011
deficit and said its funding needs will “significantly
decline.”  The government raised 56.3 billion forint ($267 million) in
bonds due in 2014, 2016 and 2020 at the auction and subsequent
non-competitive sale, 6.3 billion forint more than planned, as
yields dropped on all three maturities from the previous sale on
Sept. 9, according to the debt management agency’s Bloomberg
page. Bids totaled 128 billion forint at the auction.  “The government’s pledge to narrow the shortfall to 3
percent of output changed investors’ attitude toward Hungarian
debt,”  Sandor Jobbagy , an analyst at Intesa SanPaolo Spa’s
local unit, said before the auction.  The deficit in Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted
eastern member, will be about 2.8 percent of economic output in
2011, according to Andras Karman, a state secretary at the
Economy Ministry, Magyar Nemzet newspaper reported yesterday.
That went further than Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Sept. 13
pledge to narrow the gap to no more than 3 percent, and would
bring Hungary in line with targets mandated by the  International
Monetary Fund  and EU, which bailed out the country in 2008.  The government today sold 21.3 billion forint of bonds due
in 2014 at an average yield of 6.78 percent, compared with 7.18
percent on Sept. 9. It also raised 20 billion forint of 2016
notes at 6.82 percent versus 7.21 percent and 15 billion forint
for 2020 notes at 6.93 percent, compared with 7.35 percent.  About-Face  Hungary sold almost double the amount of bonds it planned
on Sept. 9, a day after the Economy Ministry began the latest
round of budget-cutting promises by saying the government was
committed to keeping the  deficit  below 3 percent of economic
output in 2011. The pledge marked an about-face after a row with
the IMF and the EU that ended with loan talks breaking off in
July as the government sought to widen the deficit to boost
economic growth.  On Sept. 21, the country sold 65 billion forint of three-
month Treasury bills, 15 billion forint more than offered, at a
yield five basis points lower than an auction a week earlier.  The country will need “about 850 billion forint” in debt
sales and loans next year after an estimated 1.03 trillion
forint this year, the  Economy Ministry  said on its website on
Sept. 14.  The yield on Hungary’s five-year bonds has declined 58
basis points and the forint has appreciated the most among
emerging-market currencies this month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Insufficient’  “We struggle to see value at these levels,”  Esther Law ,
an emerging-markets strategist at Societe Generale SA in London,
wrote in a note to clients today. “Recent verbal commitments by
the government to cut its budget deficit to below 3 percent next
year are insufficient to change our cautious view on Hungary at
this juncture.”  Hungary’s commitment to cut the budget deficit hasn’t
removed the threat to its investment-grade debt rating because
the government needs to clarify its economic policies, Standard
& Poor’s said on Sept. 15. Moody’s Investors Service said fiscal
plans will steer its decision on whether to downgrade the
country’s debt  “Investors are still faced with risks as the measures that
would ensure a narrower budget deficit haven’t yet been
presented,” Jobbagy said.
