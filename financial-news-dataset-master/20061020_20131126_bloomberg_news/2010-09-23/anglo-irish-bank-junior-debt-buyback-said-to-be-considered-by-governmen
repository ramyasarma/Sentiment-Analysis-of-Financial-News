Ireland’s government is considering
options for  Anglo Irish Bank Corp.,  including allowing the
company to buy back subordinated debt, a person with knowledge 
of the situation said.  Anglo Irish, the Dublin-based lender taken over by the
government last year, said as recently as Sept. 8 that it sought
approval from authorities to repurchase more subordinated debt.  The company generated more than 1.5 billion euros ($2 
billion) of profit from previous buybacks, said the person 
who declined to be identified as no final decision has been
made. The cost to insure Ireland’s debt climbed to a record 
today on concern Anglo Irish may default on some securities.  “Anglo wants to do a buyback of subordinated debt at a
punitive discount,” said  Cathal O’Leary , head of fixed-income
sales at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. “That’s an acceptable form
of capital raising. It is not a default.”  Swaps on subordinated debt of Anglo Irish now cost 5
million euros in advance and 500,000 euros annually to insure 10
million euros of debt for five years.  The company has 2.45 billion euros of subordinated debt
outstanding, after buying back securities last year at an
average level of 32 cent in the euro.  “The government could save 2 billion euros with a
subordinated buyback,” said O’Leary. “This is a good thing.
