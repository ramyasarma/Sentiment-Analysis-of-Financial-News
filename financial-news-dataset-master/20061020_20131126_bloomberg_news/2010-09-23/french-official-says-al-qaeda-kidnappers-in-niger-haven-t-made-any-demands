The al-Qaeda-linked group that
kidnapped seven people in Niger a week ago has yet to make any
demands, French Defense Minister  Herve Morin  said.  “At this point our interest is in making contact with the
group,” Morin said in an interview with RTL radio. “They
should at least just put some demands on the table.”  Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, which operates in the southern
Sahara desert, has issued two statements claiming the kidnapping
of the five French, one Togolese, and one Madagascan, and
warning the French military not to intervene. The group killed a
78-year old French hostage in July after French and Mauritanian
soldiers attacked an AQIM base in Mali.  Morin said there was no link to the kidnapping two days ago
of three French from an oil services boat owned by  Bourbon SA 
off the Nigerian coast.  The Niger hostages, five workers from Vinci SA’s Satom
subsidiary and one  Areva SA  employee and his wife, were
kidnapped in Arlit, near a uranium mine, during the night of
Sept. 15 or early Sept. 16, the companies have said. French
officials say they think they’ve been moved to Mali.  “It’s an area with wide deserts, rocky mountains and few
roads,” said Morin. “It’s an area where it’s very difficult to
locate people.”  Morin wouldn’t confirm French news reports that France has
sent special forces and aircraft to Niger to track the hostages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
