Czech policy makers voted 6-1 today
to leave the two-week benchmark interest rate unchanged at a
record low as inflation risks remain “balanced,” Governor
Miroslav Singer said.   One policy maker voted for an increase of 25 basis points,
Singer said today at a press conference after the seven member
board voted to keep the rate at 0.75 percent for a third
meeting.  Plans by the government for “fiscal consolidation” are an
“anti-inflationary” risk, Singer told a press conference today
in Prague.    To contact the reporter on this story:
