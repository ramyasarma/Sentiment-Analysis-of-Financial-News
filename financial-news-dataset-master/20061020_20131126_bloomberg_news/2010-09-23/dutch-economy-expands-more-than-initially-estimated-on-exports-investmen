The Dutch economy grew more than
initially estimated in the second quarter, as exports profited
from a pickup in world trade and company investments rose.  The fifth-largest economy in the euro region expanded 1
percent from the previous three months compared with an Aug. 13
estimate of 0.9 percent second-quarter  growth , national
statistics bureau CBS in The Hague said on its website today.
From a year earlier, the  economy  grew a revised 2.2 percent.  The Netherlands, the second-largest exporter in the euro
area after neighboring Germany, said exports climbed 12 percent
from a year earlier and 2.2 percent on the quarter. Company
investments advanced, for the first time in two years, gaining
3.5 percent from the previous three month, though still falling
4.6 percent from a year earlier, according to CBS data.  Europe’s economy is showing mixed signals on the recovery.
While euro-area industrial orders declined more than economists
forecast in July, Belgian  business confidence  unexpectedly
improved for a third month in September, data showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
