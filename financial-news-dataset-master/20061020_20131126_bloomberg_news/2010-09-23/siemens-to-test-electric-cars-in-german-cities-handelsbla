Siemens AG plans to start a test
with 100 electric cars in the German cities of Berlin, Munich
and Erlangen and set up electric charging stations to gain
experience with the technology,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
Richard Hausmann, the head of smart grids at the company.  The vehicles, made by Suzuki and turned into electric cars
by closely-held Fraeger Group, will begin rolling out in
November, the newspaper said. Siemens is about to conclude
agreements with utilities and car rental companies, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
