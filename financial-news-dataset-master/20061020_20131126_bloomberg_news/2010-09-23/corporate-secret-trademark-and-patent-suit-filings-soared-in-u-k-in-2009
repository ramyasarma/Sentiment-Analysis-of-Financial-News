Lawsuits to shield corporate
secrets more than  quadrupled  in London last year and trademark
cases rose 20 percent as more companies seek to protect
intellectual property during the economic slowdown.  Disputes over trade secrets at the High Court increased
from 23 two years ago to 95 last year, while intellectual-
property cases overall rose 37 percent, the U.K.  Ministry of
Justice  said today. Patent cases rose 17 percent.  “Protecting IP becomes more, rather than less, important in
a downturn,” said Karen Seward, a lawyer at Allen & Overy LLP
in London, in an interview today. “Employees are increasingly
leveraging their value in the marketplace by trying to take
valuable information with them when they go to new jobs.”  Intellectual-property lawsuits doubled over the past five
years to account for 16 percent of all cases, the ministry
report said. Last year, cases included Diageo Plc’s lawsuit
against grocer  J Sainsbury Plc  over the Pimm’s drink label and
Pernod Ricard SA’s case against Absolute Radio to protect the
Absolut vodka trademark.  Eighty percent of a company’s commercial value resides in
intellectual property, requiring additional protection during
economic declines, said Thayne Forbes, a director at the
consulting firm Intangible Business in London.  “These latest statistics show that brand owners are more
prepared than ever to take their battle all the way to the
courts to protect the value sitting in their intangible assets,”
Forbes said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
