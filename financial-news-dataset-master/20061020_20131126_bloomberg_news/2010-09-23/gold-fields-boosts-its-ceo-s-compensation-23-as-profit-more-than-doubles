Gold Fields Ltd. , Africa’s second-
largest gold producer, boosted Chief Executive Officer  Nick Holland’s total compensation 23 percent last year to 14.4
million rand ($2.04 million) as profit more than doubled.  The payout included a salary of 6.3 million rand and a
performance bonus of 5.9 million rand, as well as pension
contributions and an expenses allowance, the company said in its
 annual report , published on its website today.  Gold Fields posted net income of 3.63 billion rand for the
year through June, up from 1.54 billion rand a year earlier,
after benefiting from rising prices for the precious metal. The
company, which is based in Johannesburg, gets about 58 percent
of its metal from South Africa, and also has mines in Ghana,
Peru and Australia.  The miner, which owns two of Africa’s biggest gold mines,
said on Aug. 5 that it expects attributable gold production of
between 3.5 million ounces and 3.8 million ounces this year.
Earlier today the company said it expects to meet its goal, with
output for the September quarter at 906,000 ounces.  South African gold producers, seeking to maintain or expand
their output, face rising costs as they dig deeper to exploit
shrinking reserves. The country has the world’s deepest mines
and workers extract the metal out of rock as far as 2.35 miles
underground.  Shares in Gold Fields fell 1.19 rand, or 1.1 percent, to
104.41 rand at 4:22 p.m. in Johannesburg, valuing the company at
75.1 billion rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. , the continent’s
biggest gold miner, was 1.1 percent higher at 322.29 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
