George “Beau” Taylor, head of
commodities proprietary trading at  Credit Suisse Group , is
leaving to start his own hedge fund backed by Blackstone Group
LP, according to two people briefed on the plans.  Taylor is leading an eight-person team to start a firm next
year with about $150 million from  Blackstone , said the people,
who asked not to be named because the information is private.  Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are
planning to close their proprietary-trading units in response to
a new rule that limits the amount of capital banks may risk in
investments for their own accounts. Blackstone, based in New
York, is the world’s biggest private-equity firm and invests in
hedge funds.  The Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
