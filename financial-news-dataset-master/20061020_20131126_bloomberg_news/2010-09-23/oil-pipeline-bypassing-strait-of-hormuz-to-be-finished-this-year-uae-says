A pipeline to send oil from the
United Arab Emirates directly to the Indian Ocean, instead of
being shipped by tanker through the Strait of Hormuz, probably
will be finished this year, said  Mohamed Al-Hamli , the nation’s
oil minister.  The $3.3 billion pipeline to the U.A.E.’s easternmost
emirate, Fujairah, aims to “bypass” the Strait and will carry
about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, Al-Hamli said in an
interview in Washington.  The waterway is a chokepoint at the mouth of the Persian
Gulf for a fifth of the world’s oil supplies. Iran has
threatened to block the Strait if attacked because of its
nuclear program.  While the U.A.E. is confident the Strait will remain open
to tankers, the purpose of the pipeline is “to really not put
too much pressure on the ships coming into the Gulf,” Al-Hamli
said.  The U.A.E. is the fourth-largest crude producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which next meets
Oct. 14 in Vienna. Al-Hamli declined to comment on whether OPEC
members would agree at the meeting to raise or lower oil
production levels.  In a speech to an energy conference in Washington, Al-Hamli
said current world oil prices aren’t high when measured against
higher exploration and production costs.  “The age of easily accessible oil is coming to an end,”
Al-Hamli said. “Oil prices are not high at all” while “the
costs of oil exploration and production have exponentially
increased.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
