Safran SA ’s  Messier-Dowty  unit,
the world’s biggest maker of landing-gear, has positioned
itself to benefit from demand for widebody planes, which it
expects will grow faster in the next five years than sales of
other aircraft, said the division’s chief.  Widebody production will pick up “significantly” between
now and 2015, even as demand for single aisle-planes is still
growing, with both Airbus SAS and  Boeing Co.  increasing output,
said Messier-Dowty Chief Executive Officer Pascal Senechal.
Messier-Dowty has relied mainly on Airbus to buy its landing
gear in past decades, with A320 narrowbodies taking more than
4,500 sets to date.  The  Safran  unit’s widebody business was boosted when
Boeing chose it, rather than Goodrich Corp., to equip the 787
Dreamliner. Messier-Dowty has also won contracts to supply the
nose landing gear on the Airbus A380 superjumbo, and the main
landing gear on the new long-range A350, Senechal said.  In “tomorrow’s market, with the 787 coming on stream, and
the A350, and the tapering off of the Airbus A330, our
activities will be principally focused on the big twin-aisle
planes,” said Senechal at in interview in Bidos, a village on
the edge of the French Pyrenees where Messier-Dowty specializes
in making hydraulic shafts for landing gear.  Increased Production  Airbus is raising single-aisle production to 40 a month in
2012 from 34, and Boeing is lifting it to 38 a month in 2013
from 31.5 now. Narrowbody production will stabilize between
2015 and 2020, Senechal predicted.  Growth will come mainly in the twin-aisle market, Senechal
said. Messier-Dowty is building eight to nine landing gear sets
for twin-aisles each month, and that will grow to more than 20
by 2015, he said. He declined to give revenue projections for
the unit.  Last year, 92 percent of Messier-Dowty’s Bidos-plant sales
came from commercial planes and 8 percent from military.  Until now less than 1 percent of Messier-Dowty’s sales have
come from Boeing commercial planes, because the 787 is Messier-
Dowty’s first Boeing commercial plane program and the model’s
not yet in service, Senechal said.  After 787 deliveries start,  Boeing  will contribute 15
percent of sales by 2015, Senechal predicted. Deliveries of the
Dreamliner are set to begin early next year, after delays
pushed the plane program back by three years.  Deliveries of the A350 are set to start in 2013. A380
deliveries began at a crawl in 2007 and are now coming at a
rate of two a month.  Lead Time  The price of landing gear shipsets represents as much as 2
percent of a plane’s total cost, with widebodies selling
generally for between $150 million and $250 million.  Landing gear is the longest lead item after engines in
commercial aircraft, because of the early planning required
with aircraft makers for integrating the landing gear into the
airframe and also due to sourcing, requiring as much as 18
months.  “Landing gear is a good thermometer for measuring
activity in the planemaking sector,” said Senechal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
