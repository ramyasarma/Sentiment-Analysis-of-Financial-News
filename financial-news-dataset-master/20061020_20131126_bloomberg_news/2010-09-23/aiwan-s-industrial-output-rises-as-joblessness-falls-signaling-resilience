Taiwan’s industrial production rose
more than estimated, gaining for a 12th straight month, while
the jobless rate fell to a 20-month low, increasing the central
bank’s scope to boost borrowing costs.  Output  advanced 23.4 percent in August from a year earlier,
after rising a revised 20.93 percent in July, the  Ministry of
Economic Affairs  said in Taipei today. The median of 11
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey  was for a 21.6 percent
increase.  Taiwan’s 13.1 percent first-half economic growth spurred
factory output and employment as well as home prices, raising
the risk of a property bubble. The central bank may increase its
 benchmark interest rate  next week to tackle the threat, even as
slower U.S. growth and European austerity cloud the outlook for
the exports fueling the island’s expansion.  “Today’s numbers would justify another rate hike by the
central bank as it shows they’ve further room to roll back
monetary stimulus,” said  Tony Phoo , an economist at Standard
Chartered Plc in Taipei. Phoo expects policy makers to raise the
benchmark rate by 0.125 percentage point at their quarterly
meeting on Sept. 30.  The central bank increased the benchmark by 0.125
percentage point from a record-low 1.25 percent in June. It also
capped loans for second homes in the Taipei metropolitan area to
curb real estate speculation.  Jobless Rate  A separate report today showed Taiwan’s  jobless rate 
declined to 5.11 percent in August from 5.17 percent in July.
The median estimate of seven economists in a Bloomberg News
 survey  was for unemployment of 5.13 percent.  The Taiwan dollar climbed 0.5 percent to NT$31.6 against
its U.S. counterpart by the 4 p.m. close in Taipei, while the
benchmark Taiex share index finished little changed at 8,202.54.  The island’s currency has pared gains or weakened at the
end of most trading days in the past five months due to
intervention by the central bank, according to traders.  A weaker local dollar boosts industrial output by aiding
export competitiveness at companies including Hsinchu-based
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co ., the world’s largest
custom manufacturer of chips, and Miaoli-based  Chimei Innolux
Corp ., Taiwan’s biggest maker of liquid-crystal displays.  Production at manufacturers rose 24.69 percent from a year
earlier in August, after climbing a revised 22.44 percent in
July, today’s figures showed. Output in the mining and quarrying
industries advanced 16.35 percent, and declined 6.08 percent in
the construction sector.  Export Outlook  Export orders , an indication of shipments in the next one
to three months, jumped 18.2 percent from a year earlier to
$34.88 billion in August, data this week showed. The strength of
the yen has been helping the island’s exporters, Huang Ji-Shih,
head of the economic ministry’s statistics division, told
reporters on Sept. 20.  The number of unemployed people declined to 576,000 in
August from 578,000 in July. Without adjusting for seasonal
factors, the jobless rate fell to 5.17 percent from 5.2 percent.  The government aims to cut the unemployment rate to 5
percent by the end of 2010, Premier  Wu Den-yih  said earlier this
month. State-monopoly Taiwan Water Corp. has announced plans to
take on 200 temporary workers, while Chimei intends to hire
3,500 workers by the end of the year.  The $355.5 billion economy expanded by 12.53 percent in the
three months through June. Growth will slow to 6.9 percent in
the third quarter from a year earlier and 1.37 percent in the
fourth, according to a forecast by the nation’s statistics
bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
