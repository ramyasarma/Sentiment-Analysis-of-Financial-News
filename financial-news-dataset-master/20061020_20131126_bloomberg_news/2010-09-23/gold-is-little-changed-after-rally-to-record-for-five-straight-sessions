Gold prices rose, approaching
another record, on speculation the precious metal will
outperform stocks and other investments.  Futures reached an all-time high of $1,298 an ounce
yesterday as the dollar slumped. Gold has gained 18 percent this
year, while the MSCI World Index of equities has dropped 0.3
percent and the greenback climbed 2.8 percent against a basket
of major currencies.  “I see no reason why gold should stop going higher,” said
 Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset Management in
Evanston, Illinois. “There’s nowhere else to put your money, so
people are going to pile into gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $4.20, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,296.30 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $1,297.50. The
metal climbed to a record in the previous five sessions.  U.S. stocks fluctuated and Treasuries gained, pushing the
10-year note yield below 2.5 percent for the first time in three
weeks. The dollar rose as much as 0.4 percent against a basket
of six major currencies.  “The stock market is in a defined trading range,” Kaplan
said. “You can’t buy Treasury bills and bonds because they pay
next to nothing. Gold has been rising, and that’s where the
money is going, but it’s going to be a hard day for gold to get
to $1,300 because the dollar is higher.”  Some investors may sell the metal as the price trades close
to a record, analysts said.  ‘Take Profit’  “Gold’s had a good advance, so short-term traders will
take profit,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading
LLC in Chicago. “Some of this advance has been a bit much, so
we could see a correction at any time now.”  The 14-day relative-strength index for gold futures rose to
75 today, a signal to some traders that the price is poised to
fall.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 15.8 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $21.213 an ounce, the highest closing price for
a most-active contract since Oct. 15, 1980. Earlier, the price
reached $21.265, the highest intraday level since March 2008.  Platinum futures for January delivery climbed $17.50, or
1.1 percent, to $1,654.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery jumped $14.95, or
2.8 percent, to $556.85 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
