MTN Group Ltd. ’s Rwandan unit
temporarily cut the cost of mobile-phone text messages by as
much as 67 percent amid increased competition, the  New Times 
reported, citing Yvonne Makolo, a senior marketing officer.  MTN Rwanda subscribers will pay 10 Rwandan francs (2 cents)
to send messages to other MTN customers, compared with 30 francs
previously, while an SMS to a rival network will be reduced to
25 francs from 53 francs, the Kigali-based newspaper said.  Rival  Rwandatel SA  charges 10 francs for messages on its
network and 15 francs to competitors’ networks, while  Tigo
Rwanda  charges 3 francs and 25 francs respectively, it said.  MTN Rwanda’s tariff changes are a promotion and are not
permanent, the newspaper said, without saying how long the offer
will last.  To contact the reporter on this story:
