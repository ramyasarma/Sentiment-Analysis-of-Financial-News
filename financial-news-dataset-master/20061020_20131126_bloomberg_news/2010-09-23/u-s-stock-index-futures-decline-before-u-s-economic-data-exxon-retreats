U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its longest drop in a month, as a
deteriorating profit outlook for banks and an increase in
jobless claims overshadowed a rally in technology shares.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and Citigroup Inc. fell more than
2 percent as Bank of America Corp. cut profit projections and
former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker  said the U.S.
mortgage market is “absolutely broken.”  Real estate  companies
in the S&P 500 slumped 2.7 percent as a group.  Apple Inc.  rose
for the 17th time in 19 days, briefly passing PetroChina Co. to
become the world’s second-largest company by market value.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.8 percent to 1,124.83 at 4 p.m. in New
York, retreating for a third day, the longest losing streak
since Aug. 24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 76.89
points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,662.42.  “It got ugly,” said  Michael Cuggino , who manages about $8
billion at Permanent Portfolio Funds in San Francisco. “We got
less than thrilling economic news today coupled with comments by
a prominent person. On top of that, the market has had a nice
run. That’s the recipe for a selloff. We’re in a period of
anemic economic growth. Investors are reacting accordingly.”  The S&P 500 has climbed 7.2 percent in September as
technology bellwethers announced buybacks, dividends and
acquisitions. The  benchmark for U.S. equities  has declined 7.6
percent from this year’s high in April on concern that American
unemployment and widening budget deficits in Europe would derail
global growth.  Jobless Claims  U.S. stocks started the day lower after applications for
unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, a sign
companies remain cautious about hiring as growth slows. Initial
 jobless claims  increased by 12,000 to 465,000 in the week ended
Sept. 18, Labor Department figures showed.  The S&P 500 recovered from its lows in the first half hour
and swung between gains and losses for much of the day after the
National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned
homes rose 7.6 percent in August, more than the median economist
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey that called for a 7.1
percent increase.  “It’s just a mixed picture,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who
helps oversee $13.3 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. “It’s difficult to say that we’re seeing material
strengthening of economic activity. The market will be bouncing
between overbought and oversold.”  Financial Slump  The  S&P 500 Financials Index  sank 2 percent, the biggest
decline among 10 industries.  Lenders retreated after Bank of America cut its third-
quarter earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and
Morgan Stanley, saying that a “severe summer slowdown weighs on
trading.”  Goldman Sachs , the most profitable firm on Wall Street,
declined 2.1 percent to $144.91.  Citigroup  slid 2.1 percent to
$3.80, and Morgan Stanley slipped 0.8 percent to $24.74.  Analyst  Dick Bove  at Rochdale Securities LLC also slashed
his 2010 and 2011 earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley and cut
this year’s profit projection for Goldman Sachs.  Simon Property Group Inc. led a gauge of real-estate
companies down 2.7 percent, the biggest decline among 24
industries in the S&P 500. Creating a new framework for the
private mortgage market “is a matter of first priority,”
Volcker, an adviser to President  Barack Obama , said at a banking
conference in Chicago. Simon Property fell 2.6 percent to
$92.78.  Apple Tops PetroChina  Apple rose 0.4 percent to $288.92, and earlier reached
$292.76. Apple was valued at $267.1 billion as of 2:28 p.m. New
York time, topping PetroChina to become the second-biggest in
the world by market value. At its close, Apple’s value fell to
$263.9 billion, putting it back in third place. Exxon Mobil
Corp. is the world’s biggest company, with a value of $311
billion.  Piper Jaffray Cos. analyst  Gene Munster  raised his 2011
earnings estimate for Apple to $17.75 a share from $16.87 a
share, while boosting his 12-month projection on the shares to
$390 from $371. Munster forecast 2011 Apple iPad sales of 21
million, up from 14.5 million units. He also estimated that the
company will sell 10.7 million units in 2010, making up 94
percent of the global computer-tablet market.
       Red Hat Inc.  surged 9 percent to $40.07, the highest price
since April 2000. The largest seller of the Linux operating
system reported second-quarter profit of 19 cents a share,
beating the average analyst estimate by 2.7 percent.  Nvidia Corp.  gained 2 percent to $11.62. The maker of chips
for computer-graphics cards was raised to “outperform” from
“market perform” at BMO Capital Markets.  ‘Stocks Look Cheap’  “Stocks look cheap, especially in the technology
industry,” said  David Goerz , who oversees $17 billion at
Highmark Capital Management Inc. in San Francisco. “If the
economy is not going to experience a double dip, earnings will
continue to grow and the equity market should do very well.”  Bed Bath & Beyond  gained 3.2 percent to $43.40. The home
furnishings retailer increased its profit-growth forecast for
2010 to 20 percent from 15 percent.  Washington Post Co.  rallied 4.3 percent to $375.75. The
namesake owner of the fifth-largest U.S. newspaper by
circulation plans to buy back as many as 750,000 Class B shares.
The amount is about 10 percent of the Class B stock outstanding
and includes 16,312 shares that remained under a previous
buyback authorization.  To contact the reporters on this story:
