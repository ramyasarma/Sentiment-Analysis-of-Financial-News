The German goverment’s net new
borrowing requirement for 2010 will be 54 billion euros at most,
Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified people at the Finance
Ministry.  Economic growth that’s better than expected means net new
borrowing may even be less than 54 billion euros, compared with
an initial government plan to borrow 80 billion euros, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
