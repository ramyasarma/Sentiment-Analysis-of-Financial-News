India’s wholesale-price inflation
rate is likely to fall to 5.5 percent by the end of the
financial year in March 2011, a top adviser to Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh  said today.  “Our estimate is that inflation will fall to 6.5 percent
by December and 5.5 percent by March,”  Chakravarthy Rangarajan ,
chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said
in the southern Indian city of Chennai.  The government is counting on stronger monsoon rains to
boost food production and rein in an inflation rate that has
prompted the central bank to raise interest rates five times
this year. Rainfall this month has been 122 percent of the 50-
year average as of Sept. 14, according to the  weather office , in
contrast with last year, when rains were the least since 1972.  Rangarajan said the central bank’s monetary policy will
“depend on inflation in the next six-to-eight weeks.” India’s
benchmark  wholesale-price inflation  slowed to 8.5 percent in
August from July’s 9.8 percent pace, after staying above 10
percent for four straight months earlier this year.  India’s food inflation rate climbed to a six-week high of
15.46 percent in the week ended Sept. 11, a report showed in New
Delhi today.  Reserve Bank of India Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said on
Sept. 20 inflation remains the “dominant” concern for the
central bank and will determine any future rate increases.  The Reserve Bank boosted the repurchase rate to 6 percent
from 5.75 percent, and the  reverse repurchase rate  a half point
to 5 percent on Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
