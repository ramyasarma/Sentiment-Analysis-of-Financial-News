U.S. stocks trimmed losses after
better-than-estimated reports on existing home sales and leading
economic indicators.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slipped 0.5 percent to
1,128.99 at 10:02 a.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 1
percent in the first half hour of trading. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 45.03 points, or 0.4 percent, to
10,694.28.  Purchases of existing houses climbed to a 4.13 million
annual pace, in line with the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News and second only to July’s 3.84
million rate as the weakest in a decade’s worth of data, the
National Association of Realtors said today in Washington.  The 0.3 percent gain in the New York-based Conference
Board’s gauge of the prospects for the economy in the next three
to six months follows a 0.1 percent increase in July.
The index was forecast to rise 0.1 percent, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 56 economists.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
