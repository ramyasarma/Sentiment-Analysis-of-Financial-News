An Italian investigation of the
Vatican Bank and its two top executives for alleged violations
of money-laundering laws is the result of a misunderstanding, a
Vatican newspaper said.  The probe stems from a “misunderstanding, which is being
cleared up,” between the Institute for Works of Religion, or
the IOR as the Vatican Bank is called, “and the bank that had
received the wire-transfer order,” daily L’Osservatore Romano
said today in an  editorial .  The IOR “cannot be considered a bank as it is commonly
understood,” the newspaper said. The IOR manages the Catholic
Church’s global assets and, “based in Vatican City, is outside
the jurisdiction of the various national banks” of Italy.  Italian police this week temporarily seized 23 million
euros ($31 million) from an account at Credito Artigiano SpA
registered to the IOR, as Rome prosecutors probe its Chairman
 Ettore Gotti Tedeschi  and Director General Paolo Cipriani for
allegedly omitting information from two wire transfers in
possible violation of money-laundering laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
