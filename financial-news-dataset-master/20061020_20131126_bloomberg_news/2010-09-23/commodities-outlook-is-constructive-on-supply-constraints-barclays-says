Commodities have a “constructive”
outlook, with supply constraints becoming a more dominant theme
in the fourth quarter, Barclays /Capital said.  “The current quarter has proved the strongest for
commodity investments so far this year, and we expect further
upside price risk in a number of markets heading into the fourth
quarter, especially in oil and base metals, but in some
agriculture markets as well,” Barclays Capital said in a global
outlook report e-mailed today. “  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
