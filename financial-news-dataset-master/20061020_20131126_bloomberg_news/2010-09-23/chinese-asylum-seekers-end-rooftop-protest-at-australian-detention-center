Nine Chinese asylum seekers
protesting on the roof at an Australian detention center ended
their demonstration after earlier today threatening to jump if
their cases weren’t reviewed, according to refugee advocates in
contact with the group.  “They’ve all come down,” Ian Rintoul, of the Refugee
Action Coalition, said by phone today from outside the Villawood
detention center in western Sydney. “We don’t have any details
about what has been agreed.”  The two-day demonstration follows a similar protest by
Tamil, Iraqi and Iranian immigrants after a Fijian facing
deportation leaped from the roof to his death on Sept. 20. The
protest focuses attention on Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s
support for mandatory  detention  as the number of detainees
across the nation nears 5,000.  “Anybody who thinks that a protest will change the way the
Australian Government deals with their application to stay in
Australia is wrong,” Immigration Minister  Chris Bowen  told
reporters in Broome, Western Australia, today. “They’re not
achieving anything.”  The immigration department identified the protesters as
Chinese.  “They are very weak and distressed,” Jamal Daoud, of the
Justice Action Network, a refugee advocacy group, said by phone
today from outside Villawood.  The demonstration at the complex managed by the Australian
unit of  Serco Group Plc  involved nine Chinese nationals,
including five men and four women, one of whom is pregnant,
Daoud said. The protestors had been on a hunger strike since
Sept. 20, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
