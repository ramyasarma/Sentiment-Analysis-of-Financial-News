PT Perusahaan Gas Negara ,
Indonesia’s biggest distributor of the fuel, may allocate $250
million to build a liquefied natural gas receiving terminal in
Belawan, North Sumatra province, next year, an executive said.  Gas Negara, based in Jakarta, will use internal cash and
bank loans to finance the project, Finance Director  Riza Pahlevi Tabrani  said today in Jakarta. He didn’t provide details.  Indonesia, the world’s largest LNG exporter after Qatar and
Malaysia, is increasing investment in infrastructure to meet
rising domestic and overseas demand for the cleaner-burning fuel.  The Belawan terminal will receive LNG shipments from
Tangguh field in Indonesia’s Papua, Investor Daily Indonesia
reported Sept. 7, citing President Director Hendi Prio Santoso.  LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to liquid for
shipping to markets beyond the reach of pipelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
