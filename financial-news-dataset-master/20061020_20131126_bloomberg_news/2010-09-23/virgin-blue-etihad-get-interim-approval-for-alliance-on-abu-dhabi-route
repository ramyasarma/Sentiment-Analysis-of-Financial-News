Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd. ,
Australia’s second-largest airline, gained interim approval from
the nation’s antitrust regulator for an alliance with Etihad
Airways PJSC on flights to Abu Dhabi.  The endorsement allows both airlines to prepare for an
alliance and promote it to customers before a final ruling, the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a
statement today.  Qantas Airways Ltd. , Australia’s largest carrier, had
opposed interim approval and cited concern about the impact on
prices between Abu Dhabi and Europe. Today’s decision follows
the rejection of two other alliances involving Brisbane-based
Virgin Blue earlier this month.  Virgin Blue Chief Executive Officer  John Borghetti  said in
a separate statement the carriers would begin sales from Oct. 1.
The airlines will operate 27 flights a week between Australia
and Abu Dhabi, he said.  The ACCC blocked a tie-up with Air New Zealand Ltd. for
flights across the Tasman Sea on concern it may reduce
competition. Both carriers can provide more information by
tomorrow before a final decision, the antitrust regulator said
in its Sept. 10 draft ruling.  A day earlier, the U.S. Transportation Department blocked
Virgin Blue’s plan to ally with  Delta Air Lines Inc.  on flights
between Australia and the U.S. east coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
