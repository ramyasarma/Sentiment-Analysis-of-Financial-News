Diageo Plc , the world’s largest
spirit maker, will focus on expanding sales of its  Guinness 
stout in Southeast Asia, according to  Brian Duffy , the managing
director for the brand.  “It’s less about China and more about Southeast Asia,”
Duffy said today in an interview with Bloomberg News in Dublin.
“I think we can expand our footprint.”  London-based Diageo said Aug. 26 that demand for Guinness
was “flat” in the year through June as a decline in Europe was
offset by growth in Southeast Asia, which accounts for just over
10 percent of sales of the stout. Duffy said today that there’s
also scope to grow in African markets.  Guinness is increasing  sales  versus competitors in its home
market of Ireland in a “difficult” market, according to Duffy.  “People’s readiness to spend is reduced, but within that
we’re growing share,” he said.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
