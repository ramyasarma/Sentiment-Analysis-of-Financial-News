Rite Aid Corp. , the third-largest
U.S. drugstore chain, reduced its sales forecast for the year,
sending the shares down as much as 11 percent.  Sales will amount to as much as $25.4 billion, the Camp
Hill, Pennsylvania-based company said today in a statement. That
compared with a previous top target of $25.6 billion. The
company also posted a wider second-quarter loss than analysts
projected.  Sales fell 2.5 percent in the quarter ended Aug. 28, hurt
by a “sluggish economy,” Rite Aid said. The chain, led by
Chief Executive Officer John Standley, has more than 4,700
stores across the U.S.  Rite Aid  fell  15 cents, or 14 percent, to 95 cents at 9:42
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
had  fallen  27 percent this year before today.  The second-quarter loss widened to $199.3 million, or 23
cents a share, from $120.4 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier.
Analysts on average  projected  16 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
