Anglo American Plc expects its
Minas Rio iron-ore project in Brazil to come on stream in the
“foreseeable future,” following delays and cost overruns.  The venture is “progressing well,” Robert Brownlee, a
general manager in Anglo American’s iron ore division, said
today at a conference in London. The infrastructure is in place
and the first phase of the project is already “fully
committed,” he said.  Anglo, which initially planned to begin mining at Minas Rio
this year, said in July the earliest possible start date is now
in 2013, following delays in getting permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
