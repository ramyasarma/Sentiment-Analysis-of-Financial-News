Crude oil is poised for a drop to
$61 a barrel after prices fell below a “bearish pennant”
formation, according to a technical analysis by Kase and
Company.  The bearish pennant that “recently broke lower indicates
that major support should be tested at $71.49 and then $70.50 in
the near-term,” said  Dean Rogers , an analyst at the
Albuquerque, New Mexico-based consulting company. “Upon a close
below $70.50 a barrel, oil prices will likely drop into the mid-
to low-$60 range with $61.20 as the major lower support
target.”  A bearish pennant pattern is signaled by a series of higher
highs and lows featuring narrower intraday trading ranges.  “There is still a bit of indecision surrounding the
market, and a move back above $77.10 would jeopardize the
formation, but on balance, odds favor the move lower
continuing,” Rogers said in an e-mail.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 26 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $74.71 a barrel yesterday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The contract has fallen 4.3 percent since
reaching a high settlement of $78.03 on Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
