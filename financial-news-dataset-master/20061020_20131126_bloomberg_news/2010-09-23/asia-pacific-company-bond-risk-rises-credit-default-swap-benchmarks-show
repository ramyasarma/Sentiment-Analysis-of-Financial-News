The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index jumped 3.5 basis points
to 121 basis points as of 10:41 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Nomura Holdings Inc.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1 basis point to 123 as of 9:23
a.m. in Singapore, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. Markets in
Japan were closed for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
