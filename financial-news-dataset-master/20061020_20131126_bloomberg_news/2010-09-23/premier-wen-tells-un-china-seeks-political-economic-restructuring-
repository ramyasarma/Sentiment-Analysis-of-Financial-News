Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  told the
 United Nations  General Assembly that his government will seek
political “restructuring” while creating a more conducive
environment for foreign investors.  “While deepening economic restructuring, we will also push
forward political restructuring,” Wen said in his speech today.
“Otherwise, we cannot achieve the ultimate goal of economic
reform and we will lose what we have gained from our
modernization drive.”  In remarks he said were dedicated to describing the
“real” China, Wen pledged his nation will be “even more open
to the world.” He said the Chinese government is trying to
narrow the gap between the rural poor and prospering city
dwellers.  The movement of hundreds of millions of Chinese farmers to
towns and cities in the coming decades “will create more
domestic demand than ever, open up broad market and development
space and serve as a powerful engine” for the Chinese and world
economies, he told the UN.  China, the fastest-growing major economy, will “follow
established international rules in expanding business ties with
other countries,” Wen said. “We will continue to improve the
environment for foreign investors, optimize the structure of
foreign capital utilization and explore new ways for overseas
investment and cooperation.”  China’s development is an “opportunity to the world,” Wen
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
