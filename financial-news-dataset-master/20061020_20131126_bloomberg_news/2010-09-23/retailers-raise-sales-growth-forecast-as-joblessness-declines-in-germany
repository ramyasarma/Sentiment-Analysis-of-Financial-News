Germany’s  retail sales  will
increase about 1.5 percent this year as unemployment declines
and the economy recovers, an industry group said.  The German Retail Federation, or HDE, previously predicted
flat sales this year after the economic  crisis  led to a revenue
decline of 2 percent last year. Sales will probably total 407
billion euros ($543 billion), still below 2008’s record, the
group said.  “This isn’t much more than a return to normal” after last
year’s drop, HDE Executive Director  Stefan Genth  said at a press
conference in Dusseldorf today.  Germany’s economy expanded at a record pace in the second
quarter and unemployment declined in August as companies such as
 Daimler AG  and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG added workers.  The HDE, the country’s biggest retail association, “isn’t
pessimistic” about 2011 as Germans have high savings and
expectations for the labor market are positive, Genth said,
without providing a more detailed forecast.  Clothing sales added 1.9 percent in the eight months
through August, while consumer-electronics sales rose 3.8
percent, according to the  HDE , which represents an industry
with about 2.9 million full-time and part-time workers.  German retail sales have been held back in the past decade
as sales of cheaper private labels rose to a record last year
and discount grocers including Aldi and Lidl increased their
market share. Retail sales were 398 billion euros in 2000,
according to the HDE’s statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
