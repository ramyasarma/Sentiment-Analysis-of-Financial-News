Societe Generale  SA, France’s
second-largest bank by market value, hired  Fidelio Tata  to head
U.S. interest rates strategy in New York.  Tata, 44, was chief derivative strategist at RBS Securities
Inc., the U.S. broker-dealer unit of Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, until January. He began work Aug. 4, according to  Jim Galvin , a New York-based spokesman for Societe Generale. Tata
will report to  Stephen Gallagher , the chief U.S. economist.  In the newly created position, Tata will seek to expand the
bank’s fixed-income research in the U.S. in line with the firm’s
overall goal of gaining a bigger market share of U.S. dollar-
bond origination, sales and trading, according to a statement
released by the Paris-based bank.  Tata, who is part of Societe Generale’s Corporate &
Investment Banking unit, was most recently a global product
manager at TradingScreeen Inc., a provider of electronic trading
systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
