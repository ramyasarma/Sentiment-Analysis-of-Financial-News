PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s
largest bank, and PZU SA, the country’s biggest insurer,
consider placing a bid for Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka AS, a
Czech unit of KBC Groep NV, Puls Biznesu reported, citing a
person close to the PKO’s management.  The companies may fail with their offer as KBC doesn’t plan
to sell the entire subsidiary, Puls said. It maintains the plan
to sell a minority stake in CSOB in a public offering at a
“right moment,” KBC’s spokesman Stef Leunens told the Warsaw-
based newspaper.  PZU’s spokesman Michal Witkowski declined to comment, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
