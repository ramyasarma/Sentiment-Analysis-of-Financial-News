Sri Lankan President  Mahinda Rajapaksa  said he has set the nation on a course toward
political reconciliation with the Tamil minority and economic
recovery following a three-decade civil war.  “The entire focus of our nation is now on building a
lasting peace, healing wounds, ensuring prosperity and
guaranteeing the rights of the whole nation to live in
harmony,” Rajapaksa said in a speech today to the  United
Nations  General Assembly in New York.  Sri Lankan soldiers defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam in May last year, ending their struggle for a separate
homeland. The war killed more than 100,000 and has left about
76,000 Tamils displaced.  “No nation on earth can wish Sri Lanka’s Tamil community
more good fortune than Sri Lanka itself,” Rajapaksa said. “Sri
Lanka has already returned over 90 percent of the internally
displaced persons to their original villages that were
previously riddled with landmines and provided the essential
infrastructure necessary to resume normal life.”  The  economy  expanded 8.5 percent in the three months ended
June 30 from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2002, the
statistics department said on Sept. 16.  Rajapaksa said the aim of his second term in office, which
begins in two months, was to make Sri Lanka “one of the top 30
countries for doing business by 2014” and to double per capita
income by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
