Bonds from  Microsoft Corp. , the
world’s largest software maker, rose on their first day of
trading amid investor demand for top-rated corporate debt that’s
outstripping limited supply.  Microsoft’s $1 billion of 30-year, 4.5 percent debt rose
0.274 cent to 99.185 cents on the dollar, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The company’s bonds were the most actively
traded U.S. corporate securities, with 314 transactions of more
than $1 million, Trace data show.  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is one of only four
non-financial U.S. companies with top credit ratings, making it
attractive to institutional investors that are required to buy
investment-grade debt, said  Guy LeBas , a fixed-income strategist
with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. The others with the same AAA
grade --  Automatic Data Processing ,  Johnson & Johnson  and  Exxon
Mobil Corp.  -- aren’t likely to issue bonds soon, LeBas said.  “There’s virtually no supply of that debt,” said LeBas,
whose Philadelphia-based firm provides financial advisory
services. Johnson & Johnson issued 30-year debt last month
that’s tied with Microsoft for the lowest coupon.  Microsoft sold $4.75 billion of bonds yesterday in a four-
part offering, including three- and five-year maturities at the
lowest coupons on record. The software maker issued $1 billion
of 0.875 percent notes due in 2013 and $1.75 billion of 1.625
percent debt maturing in 2015.  The company’s debt is “almost Treasury like” in its lack
of risk, said  William Larkin , who helps manage $500 million in
fixed-income assets at Cabot Money Management in Salem,
Massachusetts. The software maker reported $36.8 billion in cash
and short-term investments at the end of last quarter.  Microsoft’s $1 billion of 3 percent bonds due in 2020
climbed 0.872 cent to 100.008 cents on the dollar. Bonds often
rise in first-day trading because initial offerings are priced
with slightly wider spreads to make sure they’re sold, LeBas
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
