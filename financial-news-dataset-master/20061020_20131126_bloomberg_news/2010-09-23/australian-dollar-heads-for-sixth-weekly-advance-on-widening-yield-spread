The Australian dollar rose to a
two-year high and extended toward a sixth weekly gain versus the
greenback as stocks and commodities rose, spurring demand for
currencies linked to growth.  Australia’s currency has the longest weekly winning streak
since September 2009 as the spread between two-year yields in
 Australia  and the U.S. was near the widest in two years after
better-than-forecast data from the U.S. and Europe helped
bolster investor appetite for higher-yielding assets. New
Zealand’s dollar slid for a second day versus the Aussie on
speculation the smaller nation’s economy is slowing.  “Declining yields in the U.S. will boost the yield
advantage of Australian debt over U.S. securities,” said
 Toshiya Yamauchi , a senior currency analyst in Tokyo at Ueda
Harlow Ltd.  Australia’s dollar advanced 1 percent to 95.79 U.S. cents
at 12:16 p.m. in New York from 94.89 cents yesterday, having
gained 2.5 percent this week. The currency climbed to 96.15
cents, the strongest since July 2008. The Aussie added 0.9
percent to 80.76 yen from 80.08 yen.  New Zealand’s currency rose 0.6 percent to 73.32 U.S.
cents, from 72.92 cents and advanced a 1.2 percent this week.
The currency was at 61.81 yen from 61.54 yen.  The MSCI World Index of equities gained 1.5 percent, the
most since Sept. 1. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials added 1 percent.  Bond Spreads  The kiwi, as the currency is nicknamed, was near a five-
month low against Australia’s dollar as the yield advantage of
New Zealand’s 10-year bonds dropped yesterday to the least since
July 2009. The New Zealand dollar slid to NZ$1.3068 per
Australian dollar, from NZ$1.2905 last week, after touching
NZ$1.3082 yesterday, the weakest since April 21.  Orders  for goods such as computers and communications gear
in the U.S. climbed 4.1 percent after a 5.3 percent decline in
July that was smaller than previously estimated, figures from
the Commerce Department showed today in Washington.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its  business climate
index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.8
from 106.7 in August. That’s the highest since June 2007.
Economists had expected a drop to 106.4, according to the median
of 36 forecasts in Bloomberg News survey.  The  yield  on the two-year Treasury rose two basis points to
0.43 percent. The  extra return  investors get for investing in
two-year Australian debt compared with similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries increased to 4.42 percentage points yesterday, the
most since June 2008.  Higher Yields  Benchmark interest rates of 4.5 percent in  Australia  and 3
percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in  Japan  and
close to zero in the U.S., attract investors to the South
Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades
is that currency market moves will erase profits.  Minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s meeting this
month showed policy makers said higher interest rates may be
needed to cope with the nation’s economic expansion. The RBA
raised borrowing costs in six, quarter-percentage-point steps
from October to May.  The Federal Reserve said this week it’s willing to ease
monetary policy further to spur growth and support prices.  “Our short-term model’s fair value band for the Aussie
dollar-U.S. dollar is 96 cents,” said  John Kyriakopoulos , head
of currency strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney.
“We will likely need to see further improvements in its drivers
such as risk-appetite to break above this level.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
