Germany is home to 1,000 companies
that are world market leaders, more than any other comparable
industrialized nation, Manager-Magazin reported, citing a study
by Munich company researcher Bernd Venohr.  They have combined sales of 1.7 trillion euros and employ
about 7 million people worldwide, with the most important of the
companies producing such industrial goods as machines, plant
installations and automobiles, according to the report. It said
Baden-Wuerttemberg has more market-leading companies than any
other German state, followed by North Rhine-Westphalia and
Bavaria.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
