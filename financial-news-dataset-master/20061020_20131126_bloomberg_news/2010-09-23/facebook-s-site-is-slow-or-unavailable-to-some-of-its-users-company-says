Facebook Inc., the world’s biggest
online social-networking service, said some users are having
difficulty reaching the site for the second time in two days.  The service is slow or inaccessible for some users,
Meredith Chin, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
statement. The site was inaccessible yesterday for some users
because of an issue with a third-party networking provider for
part of the day, the Palo Alto, California-based company said.  “We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as
possible,” Chin said today.  Facebook, which has grown to more than 500 million members,
is grappling with access difficulties as the company tries to
woo more advertisers to use the website to reach potential
customers. Facebook may double its sales to at least $1.4
billion in 2010 from $700 million to $800 million last year, two
people familiar with the closely held company said in July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
