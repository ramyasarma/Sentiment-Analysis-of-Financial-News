Nomura Holdings Inc. forecast a
weaker dollar ending the year and into 2011 amid expected
purchases of Treasuries by the Federal Reserve starting in the
fourth-quarter.  The company lowered its projection for the dollar to end
2010 at $1.35 per euro, compared with $1.25. Nomura forecast the
greenback at 1.04 Swiss franc, compared with 1.12.  The Federal Open Market Committee said Sept. 21 it would be
willing to ease monetary policy to bolster the U.S. economy
boosting expectations of a second round of quantitative easing.  “We are revising our U.S. dollar forecasts lower, taking
in to account the effect from expected QE2 during the fourth
quarter,” a group of Nomura analysts led by  Jens Nordvig  wrote
in a note to investors. “In terms of specific crosses European
currencies are likely to respond the most, especially now that
Japan has started to intervene to reduce strengthening pressure
on the yen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
