Avis Budget Group Inc.  increased
its offer for  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc.  to $1.52
billion, topping a proposal from  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. 
while declining to match its breakup fee.  The cash portion of the bid was raised 12 percent to $45.79
a share while the stock portion remained at 0.6543 of an Avis
share, Parsippany, New Jersey-based Avis said today in a
statement. The offer values Dollar Thrifty at $53 a share.
Hertz’s most recent bid is worth $50.25 a share, or $1.44
billion.  Dollar Thrifty agreed to Hertz’s offer and its  shareholders 
are set to vote on the proposal Sept. 30. The owner of the
Dollar and Thrifty car-rental brands has said it wants Avis to
match Hertz’s $44.6 million breakup fee in case the acquisition
doesn’t win regulatory approval.  “The problem all along with what Avis has been doing is
they have a clear path to getting Dollar Thrifty’s attention --
put a reverse termination fee in the bid,”  Fred Lowrance , an
analyst at Avondale Partners LLC in Nashville, Tennessee, said
in an interview. “For the third time in this process they
haven’t done that.”  David Reno , a Dollar Thrifty spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a phone message seeking comment.  Dollar Thrifty, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, gained 97 cents,
or 1.9 percent, to $52.34 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading . Park Ridge, New Jersey-based Hertz fell 42
cents, or 3.9 percent, to $10.45. Avis dropped 44 cents, or 4
percent, to $10.58.  Hertz Divestitures  Hertz has begun divesting its Advantage Rent-a-Car discount
brand to speed the closing of the Dollar Thrifty deal,  Richard Broome , a spokesman, said in an interview Sept. 12.  Dollar Thrifty has gained 35 percent since the day before
Hertz’s offer of $41 a share in cash and stock was announced in
April. The  shares  traded for less than $1 as recently as March
2009.  Hertz is the largest worldwide airport car-rental brand,
operating from more than 8,200 locations in 146 countries.  Ford
Motor Co.  in December 2005 sold Hertz to Clayton Dubilier & Rice
Inc., the Carlyle Group and Merrill Lynch’s buyout unit. The
car-rental company raised $1.32 billion in an initial share sale
less than a year later.  Citigroup Inc.  and Morgan Stanley are providing financial
advice to Avis, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Arnold & Porter LLP
are acting as legal counsel.  Barclays Plc and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch
advised Hertz on its April offer, with Debevoise & Plimpton LLP
and Jones Day providing legal advice. Dollar was advised by
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and law firm
Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
