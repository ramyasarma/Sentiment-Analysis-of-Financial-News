Five U.K. government departments
have agreed the details of budget cuts over the next four years,
the Treasury said.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has reached
agreements with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, led by  Caroline Spelman , and the Department for
Communities and Local Government, headed by  Eric Pickles , the
Treasury said. The Treasury, the Foreign Office and the Cabinet
Office have already settled their budgets.  Pickles and Spelman will be appointed to the government
committee that oversees the cuts, a spokesman for the Treasury
said.  All five departments have agreed to cutting headcount and
administration costs while capital budgets are still being
negotiated. Local government spending also remains to be
settled, the Treasury said.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition of Conservatives
and Liberal Democrats is proposing expenditure cuts and tax
increases totaling 113 billion pounds ($178 billion) to reduce a
record deficit of 11 percent of economic output. Osborne is due
to set budgets for each department in a spending review on
October 20.  The Treasury has told most ministers to draw up scenarios
for spending reductions of both 25 percent, the average figure
specified by Osborne in the June budget, and 40 percent by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
