Punjab National Bank , India’s
second-largest government-controlled lender, may drop its
proposed $24 million acquisition of a controlling stake in
Kazakhstan’s  JSC Dana Bank .  The Indian lender hasn’t completed buying the 63.6 percent
holding in the Kazakh lender because of problems that arose
during the due diligence process, Punjab National Bank Chairman
and Managing Director  K.R. Kamath  said in an interview in New
Delhi yesterday.  “We have done nothing other than starting the due
diligence, and will walk away if things are not as we earlier
perceived,” Kamath said, declining to elaborate. The New Delhi-
based lender in October said its board approved plans for the
acquisition.  The 115-year-old Indian bank, which has foreign branches in
Hong Kong, Kabul and Dubai, as well as a subsidiary in the U.K.,
is expanding in more overseas markets. It plans to open a
subsidiary in Canada and upgrade its representative office in
Norway into a full-fledged branch, the company said in July.  Executives at Dana Bank couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment at the Almaty-based company’s offices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
