The Egyptian economy may grow at
least 6 percent in the fiscal year through June, helped by
tourism and foreign investment, Prime Minister  Ahmed Nazif  said.  “We could at least achieve a growth rate of 6 percent, and
maybe more,” Nazif told reporters today in the city of Kafr El-
Zayyat in the province of Gharbiya in northern Egypt. “The
indicators of the first quarter, which will be out in mid-
October, show that there is economic growth, especially in
tourism, foreign investment and the Suez Canal.”  Those three sources of revenue were key to helping Egypt’s
gross domestic product grow by an average of 7 percent in the
three fiscal years through June 2008. The global financial
crisis slowed growth to 4.7 percent in the following 12 months.
It accelerated to 5.3 percent last fiscal year, and the
government is targeting a rate of 5.8 percent this year.  Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30 index  rose 0.7 percent at 11:55
a.m. in Cairo, extending its gains this year to 8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
