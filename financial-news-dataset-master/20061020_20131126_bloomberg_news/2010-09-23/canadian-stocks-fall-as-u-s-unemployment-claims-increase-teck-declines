Canadian stocks  fell for a third
day after the U.S. reported an unexpected increase in initial
jobless claims and European purchasing managers reported slower
growth.  Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s third-largest
insurer, dropped 1.7 percent after the U.S. Labor Department
said first-time unemployment applications climbed 12,000 to
465,000 last week. Suncor Energy Inc., the country’s largest oil
and gas producer, slipped 1.4 percent as crude oil decreased 1.1
percent. Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s biggest base-metals and
coal producer, lost 2.3 percent after rising for the first time
in seven days yesterday.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  retreated 19.12
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,128.14 as of 10:46 a.m. in
Toronto. The index has dropped 0.9 percent since closing at a
four-month high Sept. 20.  “People are taking a bit of time here to reason whether
the valuations or the expectations that are built into some of
the stocks are reasonable,” said  Greg Eckel , who helps oversee
C$900 million ($870 million) as a money manager at Morgan
Meighen & Associates Ltd. in Toronto. “Europe had some bad news
on the purchasing number, and the jobs number was bad. It’s a
real mixed picture.”  The S&P/TSX has underperformed all but three of 23 other
developed markets’ equity benchmarks this month, hampered by a
decline in energy stocks. Energy companies make up 25 percent of
Canadian stocks by market value.  Economist Estimates  Economists had forecast the U.S. would report 450,000 new
jobless claims today, according to the median of 47 estimates in
a  Bloomberg survey . The total had dropped to a revised 453,000,
the lowest in nine weeks, in the week ended Sept. 11.  An  index  of service and manufacturing industries based on a
Markit Economics survey of euro-area purchasing managers fell to
53.8 from 56.2 last month. The median estimate of 15 economists
was 55.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The  S&P/TSX Banks Index  declined for a fourth day, while S&P/TSX
insurers retreated for a third day.  Manulife, which derived  64 percent  of its revenue from the
U.S. last quarter, lost 1.7 percent to C$12.57. Toronto-Dominion
Bank, which has 1,049 U.S. branches, decreased 0.9 percent to
C$73.58.  Crude futures retreated to $73.87 a barrel in New York.
Suncor fell 1.4 percent to C$31.90. Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company by market value,
dropped 1.1 percent to C$33.11. Canadian Oil Sands Trust, the
largest owner of the Syncrude project, declined 1.8 percent to
C$25.86.  Teck, which produces raw materials used in industry, lost
2.3 percent to C$39. Copper producer Inmet Mining Corp.
decreased 1.3 percent to C$57.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
