Rwanda ’s central bank expects the
franc to remain stable against major currencies for the
remainder of the year after it depreciated in the second
quarter,  New Times  reported, citing Governor  Francois Kanimba .  The bank “accommodated the depreciating trend in the second
quarter simply by not selling a significant amount” of foreign
exchange to lenders, the Kigali-based newspaper quoted Kanimba
as saying.  The currency is expected to remain steady as the dollar
depreciates on international markets, it said. The Rwandan
central bank may buy or sell foreign exchange to keep the market
stable in the remaining months of the year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
