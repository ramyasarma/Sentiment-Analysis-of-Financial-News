GlaxoSmithKline Plc will keep its
diabetes pill Avandia on the U.S. market with new warnings about
heart risks after a three-year battle that divided staff at the
Food and Drug Administration.  London-based Glaxo must add new cautions to Avandia’s
prescribing information, the agency said today. While the
decision to allow continued sales of the drug follows the
recommendations of an FDA advisory panel in July, analysts say
it is likely to spark increased criticism from doctors,
lawmakers and consumer groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
