German stocks declined as growth in
Europe’s services and manufacturing industries weakened more
than economists forecast in September and concern intensified
that the sovereign debt crisis will harm economic growth.  ThyssenKrupp AG and  Salzgitter AG , the country’s biggest
steelmakers, both fell more than 2 percent. Daimler AG and
Volkswagen AG paced declines in carmakers, both losing more than
1.1 percent.  The  benchmark  DAX Index retreated 0.4 percent to 6,184.71
at the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt. The gauge has fallen 2.6
percent from its high for 2010 in August as Europe’s most
indebted nations slash spending and China moves to slow its
economy. Even so, the measure has rallied 14 percent from its
low this year on Feb. 5 as investors speculated that the
sovereign-debt crisis won’t choke off the recovery. The broader
HDAX Index also slid 0.4 percent today.  “Services and manufacturing data were disappointing this
morning,”  Robert Halver , head of research at Baader Bank AG in
Frankfurt, said. “The worry that the sovereign crisis will damp
economic growth is regaining momentum. In the U.S., we are still
facing the picture of a weak economy.”  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both industries declined to 53.8 from 56.2 in
August, London-based Markit Economics said today. Economists
expected a reading of 55.7, according to the median of 15
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Bond Yields  Portuguese, Italian and Spanish 10-year bond yields rose
relative to benchmark German bunds as the weaker-than-forecast
economic data raised concern that the countries at the periphery
of the euro area will struggle to trim their budget deficits as
growth slows. The extra yield that investors demand to hold
Irish debt rather than German securities widened to a record 418
basis points, or 4.18 percentage points. The Portuguese-German
spread also reached a record 402 basis points.  U.S. economic reports proved conflicting accounts of the
strength of the world’s largest economy. Applications for
unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, yet sales of
previously owned homes in the country climbed in August to the
second-lowest level on record. Leading indicators increased more
than forecast.  ThyssenKrupp and Salzgitter lost 2.2 percent to 23.22 euros
and 3.5 percent to 48.06 euros, respectively. European
steelmakers declined as BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research said
that the price of European Hot Rolled Coil steel has fallen.  Daimler, Volkswagen  Daimler , the maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, retreated
1.1 percent to 44.35 euros. Volkswagen, Europe’s largest
carmaker, slipped 2.2 percent to 88.75 euros, while Porsche SE
sank 1.4 percent to 35.63 euros.  E.ON AG, the country’s largest utility, fell 0.7 percent to
21.57 euros, while  RWE AG , the second-biggest, slid 0.8 percent
to 50.28 euros. German electricity for delivery next year was
little changed near an eight-week low, broker data showed, on
stable emissions and natural gas prices.  Gerry Weber International AG added 3.3 percent to 29.41
euros after saying nine-month net income rose to 28.6 million
euros ($38.18 million) from 25.2 million euros a year earlier.
Group sales gained 5 percent, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
