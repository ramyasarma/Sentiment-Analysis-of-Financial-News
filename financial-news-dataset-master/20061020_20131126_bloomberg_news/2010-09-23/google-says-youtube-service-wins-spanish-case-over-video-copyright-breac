Google Inc. , owner of the most
popular search engine, said it won a case in Spain over claims
its YouTube video service was liable for copyright violations.  A federal court in Madrid rejected claims by  Gestevision
Telecinco SA  that YouTube is liable when people post copyright
infringing videos on its site, Google said in  a blog post  today.  Telecinco, a unit of  Mediaset SpA  and Spain’s largest
commercial television station, lost the suit because the court
decided YouTube offers companies whose copyright was breached
the opportunity to have any infringing content removed. The
responsibility doesn’t lie with YouTube, Google said.  “This decision demonstrates the wisdom of European laws,”
said Google on the blog. “More than 24 hours of video are
loaded onto YouTube every minute. If Internet sites had to
screen all videos, photos and text before allowing them on a
website,” sites including Twitter and Facebook “would grind to
a halt.”  Telecinco representatives couldn’t immediately be reached
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
