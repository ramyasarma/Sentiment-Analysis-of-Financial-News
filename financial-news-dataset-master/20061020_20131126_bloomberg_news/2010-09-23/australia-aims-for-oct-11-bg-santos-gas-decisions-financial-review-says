The Australian government plans to
stick to an Oct. 11 deadline to make a decision on gas projects
proposed by BG Group Plc and Santos Ltd., the Australian
Financial Review said, citing Environment Minister Tony Burke.  Burke visited the sites of the proposed BG and Santos
ventures on Sept. 22 and met with people concerned about the
effect of the coal-seam gas projects on water and farming, the
newspaper said. Australia’s previous environment minister Peter
Garrett had set the October date, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
