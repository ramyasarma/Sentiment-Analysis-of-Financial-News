Evolution Group Plc,  a London-based
stockbroker, said it’s considering an offer for smaller rival
Panmure Gordon & Co.  The company is “keen to assess Panmure Gordon’s upcoming
trading results before determining whether there is any merit in
taking its deliberations further,” London-based Evolution said
in a statement today. “No formal discussions have taken place
between management of the company and Panmure Gordon.”  U.K. brokers are seeking to consolidate after the credit
crisis cut off financing for takeovers, hurting revenue from
advising on fundraisings and mergers. Panmure, which has about
64 corporate clients, said in March its net  loss  shrank to 11.1
million pounds ($17.4 million) in 2009. A purchase would follow
broker Execution Holdings Ltd.’s December takeover of Noble
Group Holdings Ltd.  Panmure Gordon said in a separate statement that it hasn’t
held talks with Evolution. The broker also said the first half
“represented particularly challenging markets” though it
“expects a bias in revenues towards the second half.”  Panmure Gordon  gained  8.6 percent to 31.5 pence in London,
giving it a market value of about 45.7 million pounds ($71.8
million). Evolution fell 0.6 percent to 85.25 pence, paring its
market value to about 198 million pounds.  QInvest LLC, a Qatari investment bank, owns about 44
percent of Panmure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
