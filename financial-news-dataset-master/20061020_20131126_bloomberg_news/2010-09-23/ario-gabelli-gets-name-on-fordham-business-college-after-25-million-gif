Mario J. Gabelli, chairman and
chief executive officer of GAMCO Investors Inc., gave $25
million to his alma mater, Fordham University, which will rename
the undergraduate business college the Gabelli School of
Business.  Gabelli, 68, was born in the Bronx, New York, and graduated
from Fordham in 1965. His gift is the largest for the school,
which has been around for 169 years and is trying to raise $500
million. The funds will also go towards creating the Center of
Global Investment Analysis at Fordham.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
