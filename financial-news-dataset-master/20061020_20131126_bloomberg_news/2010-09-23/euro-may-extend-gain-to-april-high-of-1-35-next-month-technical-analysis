The euro may extend gains to $1.35,
the most since April, by the middle of next month, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said citing trading patterns.  The euro has surged 13 percent since June 7 when concern
Europe’s debt crisis would spread sent the currency to $1.1877,
the lowest since March 2006. The common currency broke above its
200-day moving average on Sept. 21 and touching a one-month high
of $1.3314 the following day.  “The market is dominated by dollar selling,”  Teppei Ino ,
an analyst at the unit of Japan’s largest banking group, said in
an interview. “The euro’s moving averages, from short to medium
terms, all indicate the currency will strengthen.”  It took two months for the euro to rebound by $0.1457 from
June to August, so it will probably reach $1.35 by mid-October,
Ino said. The $1.35 level represents a 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of a decline from the currency’s Nov. 25 high to the
June 7 low, Ino said.  The currency hasn’t traded above $1.35 since April 20. It
was at $1.3318 as of 7:53 a.m. in Tokyo.  Other indicators suggest the euro may enter a short-term
correction, Ino said. The currency’s Bollinger band, which
traders use to judge support and resistance levels based on a
currency’s moving average, and its Williams %R, a momentum
indicator, suggest the euro is overbought, he said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
