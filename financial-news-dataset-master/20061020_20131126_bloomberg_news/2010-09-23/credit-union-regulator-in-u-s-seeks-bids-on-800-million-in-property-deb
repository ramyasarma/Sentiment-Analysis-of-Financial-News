The federal agency that regulates
credit unions and insures more than 90 million U.S. accounts
sought bids on about $800 million in bonds backed by commercial
mortgage debt, according to a spokesman for the group.  The National Credit Union Administration offered securities
backed by commercial-property loans from Western Corporate
Federal Credit Union and U.S. Central Corporate Federal Credit
Union, both institutions seized in March 2009, said  John McKechnie , a spokesman for the NCUA in Arlington, Virginia.  The regulator is seeking to dispose of $50 billion in
assets including mortgage-related securities from failed
institutions, according to the National Association of Federal
Credit Union’s  website .  “One of our main goals is to devise a way to safely deal
with legacy assets at the lowest possible cost consistent with
sound public policy,”  Debbie Matz , chairman of the NCUA, told a
meeting of the trade groups Congressional Caucus on Sept. 21,
according to its website.  Barclays Capital managed the offering, according to two
people familiar with the proposed sale.  Kristin Friel , a spokeswoman for Barclays, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
