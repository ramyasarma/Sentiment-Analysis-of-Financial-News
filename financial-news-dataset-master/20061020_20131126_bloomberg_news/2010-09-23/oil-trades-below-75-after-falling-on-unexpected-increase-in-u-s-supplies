Oil fell in New York as the dollar
recovered from its weakest level against the euro since April,
while an increase in U.S. crude supplies reinforced concern that
the recovery is not fast enough to whittle down excess supplies.  Futures declined as much as 1.5 percent after the Energy
Department said yesterday stockpiles rose 970,000 barrels to
358.3 million last week. They were forecast to drop 1.75 million
barrels, according to the median analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline supplies also rose and are now
15 percent higher than their five-year average and distillate
stockpiles are now 23.3 percent above the five-year mean.  “We’re still sitting in a tight range,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , a VTB Capital analyst in London. “Yesterday’s data
was moderately bearish, with rising imports and refinery
processing rates still up. A slowdown in imports would really
help reduce stockpiles.”  The November contract fell as much as $1.13 to $73.58 a
barrel and traded at $73.88 in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange as of 1:31 p.m. London time. Brent
crude oil for November settlement fell $1.05 to $76.90 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The dollar gained 0.6 percent to trade at 1.3325 against
the euro, after sinking yesterday to $1.344, its weakest level
since April 21. A stronger dollar reduces the appeal of
commodities priced in the U.S. currency.  Analysts had forecast supplies would shrink after the
eight-day shutdown of the Enbridge Energy Partners LP 6A
pipeline that sends Canadian crude to the U.S. Midwest. Prices
surged on speculation the closure would cause refineries in the
Midwest to divert supply from Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery
hub for West Texas Intermediate oil traded in New York.  “A shortfall in U.S. supply from Canada after a major
pipeline closure was more than met by rising imports in other
regions,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in an e-
mailed note today.  Imports Climb  Crude oil  imports  rose 295,000 barrels a day to 9.3
million. Overseas transfers of fuel products jumped 11 percent
to 2.5 million barrels a day, the Energy Department said.  Total U.S. domestic oil product inventories reached 768.1
million barrels for the week ended Sept. 17, according to
Bloomberg calculations. That’s the highest level since 1990 when
the Energy Department began reporting weekly data. The figure
doesn’t include ethanol stockpiles.  Total consumption  of petroleum products averaged 19.2
million barrels a day last week, down 1.8 percent from the seven
days ended Sept. 10, the Energy Department report showed.  Gasoline inventories rose 1.59 million barrels to 226.1
million, the highest level since March, the report showed.
Stockpiles were forecast to drop 250,000 barrels, according to
the median of 18 analyst estimates.  Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, climbed 347,000 barrels to 174.9
million. Inventories were forecast to increase 100,000 barrels.  “The builds aren’t good for the market,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National Australia
Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “There just doesn’t seem to be the
demand around at the moment. The major industries that use oil
intensely in the U.S. are still sluggish.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
