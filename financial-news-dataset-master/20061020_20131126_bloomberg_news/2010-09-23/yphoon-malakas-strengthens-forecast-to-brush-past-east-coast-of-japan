Tropical Storm Malakas has
strengthened as it tracks north over the Pacific Ocean on course
to brush past the east coast of the main Japanese island of
Honshu in two days, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.  The agency’s  forecast  shows the typhoon churning toward the
islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima before turning north-
northeast, indicating it won’t make landfall on Japan’s main
islands. The storm is estimated to make its closest approach
about 390 kilometers (242 miles) off Hachijojima island, south
of Tokyo, at around 9 a.m. on Sept. 25, the agency said on its
website.  Malakas is expected to gain strength in the coming two days
to maximum winds of 55 meters per second (123 miles per hour)
from 40 meters per second, with a storm warning area extending
about 440 kilometers, the Japanese weather service said. The
storm’s intensity will probably weaken to an extra-tropical
cyclone by 9 a.m. on Sept. 26, it said.  Malakas was 500 kilometers south of Iwo Jima moving slowly
north-northwest at noon Japan time today, the agency  said .  Malakas means “strong” or “powerful” in the Philippines,
according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which  lists  names
assigned to storms in the northwest Pacific and South China Sea.
Malakas is the 13th storm of the northwest Pacific season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
