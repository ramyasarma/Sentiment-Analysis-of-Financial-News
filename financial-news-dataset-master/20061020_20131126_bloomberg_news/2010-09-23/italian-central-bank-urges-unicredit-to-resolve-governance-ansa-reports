The Bank of Italy has urged
UniCredit SpA to quickly resolve its governance following the
resignation of Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Profumo, Ansa
news agency reported.  The central bank, in a letter to the lender, noted that
UniCredit’s chairman should have a non-executive role only, Ansa
said.  Chairman Dieter Rampl has assumed the CEO’s
responsibilities until a replacement for Profumo is named.  The central bank also requested details on Profumo’s
severance agreement, Ansa said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
