CFS Retail Property Trust  is
seeking to  raise  about A$500 million ($477 million) to buy as
many as four shopping malls owned by  Direct Factory Outlet  in
Australia, according to two people familiar with the matter.  CFS Retail expects to complete the capital raising today,
according to one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the details aren’t public.  The real estate trust that invests in Australian shopping
centers is interested in buying DFO shopping malls in Homebush
in Sydney’s west, in South Wharf in Melbourne’s Docklands and
two others in Victoria state, with a total value of about A$600
million, the Australian Financial Review  reported  yesterday.  Malvina Zayats, a spokeswoman at Colonial First State
Property Retail Pty, which manages CFS Retail, declined to
comment.  The raising will proceed regardless of the outcome of CFS
Retail’s attempt to acquire the DFO shopping centers, one of the
people said. Melbourne-based Austexx Pty Ltd., DFO’s parent, is
trying to sell DFO’s A$1.5 billion of shopping outlets and has
agreed to refinance A$1 billion of debt to avoid going into
administration, the Financial Review reported on Aug. 20.  The purchase by Sydney-based CFS Retail looks about 70
percent likely, the person said.  CFS Retail aims to announce the result of the talks with
Austexx by the time their shares, which were halted yesterday,
begin trading tomorrow morning. The outcome may be delayed until
next week, according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
