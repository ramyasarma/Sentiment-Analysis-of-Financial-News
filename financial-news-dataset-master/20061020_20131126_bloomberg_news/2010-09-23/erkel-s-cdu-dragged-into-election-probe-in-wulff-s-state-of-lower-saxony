German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
party said it gave evidence to prosecutors investigating the
financing of its 2003 state election campaign in Lower Saxony, a
ballot that the country’s current president won.  The Christian Democratic Union’s regional head office in
Hanover handed over records on the campaign today, the state
 party  said on its website. “The prosecutor’s office told us
that the CDU in Lower Saxony isn’t under suspicion,” the state
party’s general secretary, Ulf Thiele, said in the statement.  Detectives searched 16 sites in the state today as part of
an investigation into allegations that Stadtwerke Wolfsburg AG,
the utility in the city of Wolfsburg, may have improperly
financed the CDU’s campaign, prosecutor  Klaus Ziehe  said by
phone from Braunschweig. The investigation is “at the very
beginning” and no one has been charged, he said.  The CDU won the 2003 vote in Lower Saxony, ending 13 years
of Social Democratic rule and lifting  Christian Wulff  to the
post of state premier. Wulff gave up the role after Merkel
nominated him as German president in June. Parliament elected
him to the largely ceremonial post on June 30.  Merkel and Wulff haven’t commented publicly on the
investigation in Lower Saxony, which is home to steelmaker
 Salzgitter AG  and Wolfsburg-based  Volkswagen AG , Europe’s
biggest carmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
