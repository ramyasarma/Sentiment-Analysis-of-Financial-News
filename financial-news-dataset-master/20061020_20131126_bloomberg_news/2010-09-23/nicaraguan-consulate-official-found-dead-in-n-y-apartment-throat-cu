A senior official at the Nicaraguan
consulate in New York was found dead in his Bronx apartment with
his throat slashed.  The body of Cesar Mercado, 34, was found about 10:35 a.m.
today just inside the door of his apartment on the Grand
Concourse. The body was discovered by his driver, who was
planning to take him to the United Nations, a New York police
spokesman,  Paul Browne , said by e-mail.  The victim had been working in New York for about eight
years and was the highest-ranking official at the consulate,
said an official at the Permanent Mission to the UN who declined
to give his name.  Mercado was to attend the annual meeting of the UN General
Assembly, which began Sept. 14, the official said.  A knife was found near the body, and the apartment didn’t
appear to have been ransacked, the New York Times reported,
citing Browne, the police spokesman. Mercado was seen by
neighbors yesterday, the newspaper said.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is working on the
investigation in “close coordination” with the NYPD,  Richard Kolko , an FBI spokesman in New York, said in an e-mail.  U.S. Ambassador  Robert Callahan  assured Nicaraguan
officials that the FBI would do everything it could to
investigate the case, the Associated Press reported, citing
Nicaragua Vice President  Jaime Morales .  Browne and Kolko didn’t respond to questions about whether
the death was being considered a homicide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
