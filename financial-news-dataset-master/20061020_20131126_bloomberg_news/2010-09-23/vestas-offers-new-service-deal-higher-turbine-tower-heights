Vestas Wind Systems A/S , the
world’s largest maker of wind turbines, will provide Central and
East European customers with a new type of service agreement and
higher towers to help increase productivity at wind farms.  Vestas will offer a service that guarantees a defined
turbine availability and productivity, the Randers, Denmark-
based company said in a statement published on its  website 
today. The deal will give customers the security that the
turbine will provide revenue and make the return on the
investment “more secure,” Vestas said.  Vestas will also from the third quarter of 2011 introduce
towers with a hub height of 140 meters for the new V112-3.0 MW
turbine to give customers more flexibility with forested sites.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
