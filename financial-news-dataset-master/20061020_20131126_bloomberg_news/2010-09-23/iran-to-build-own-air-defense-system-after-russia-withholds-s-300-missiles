Iran’s Defense Ministry said the
country will produce its own advanced anti-aircraft missile
system similar to THE S-300 which Russia decided not to supply
in compliance with international sanctions.  “We have planned to build a long-range air defense missile
system similar to S-300,” Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi was
quoted as saying by the state-run  Mehr  news agency in a report
published on its website late yesterday. “By God’s grace and
with Iranian engineers’ efforts, we will reach self-
sufficiency.”  Russia’s Defense Minister  Anatoly Serdyukov said in an
interview Sept. 20 that the decision not to deliver S-300
missiles to Iran  was “dictated by a complicated military and
political situation in the region and support of the United
Nations sanctions against Iran.”  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree yesterday
banning the sale of weapons, including S-300 air defense
systems, to Iran.  Iran is subject to four sets of United Nations sanctions
over uranium enrichment activities as part of its nuclear
program. Enriched uranium can fuel a nuclear reactor or form the
core of a bomb.  Iran rejects allegations that it may seek to develop
nuclear weapons, saying its program is needed to generate
electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
