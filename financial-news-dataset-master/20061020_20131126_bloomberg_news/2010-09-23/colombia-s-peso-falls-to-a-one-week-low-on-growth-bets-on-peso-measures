Colombia’s peso fell to a one-week
low after a report showed the economy grew less-than-forecast in
the second quarter.  The peso also declined on bets the central bank will
announce further measures to ease the currency’s world-beating
rally after tomorrow’s monetary policy meeting.  The currency declined 0.6 percent to 1,813.25 per dollar at
12:49 p.m. New York time, from 1,803.18 yesterday. It touched
1,813.90, its weakest level since Sept. 15. Today’s drop pared
the peso’s jump this year to 12.7 percent, still the best
performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Colombia’s economy expanded 4.5 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, the country’s national statistics
institute reported in Bogota today. That was less than the 5.5
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 31 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
