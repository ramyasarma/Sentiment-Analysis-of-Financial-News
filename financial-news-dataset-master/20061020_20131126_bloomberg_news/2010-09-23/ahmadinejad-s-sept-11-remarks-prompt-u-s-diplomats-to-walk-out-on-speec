U.S. and European diplomats walked
out of the United Nations General Assembly hall today when
Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks possibly were orchestrated to bolster the U.S.
economy and “save the Zionist regime.”  Envoys representing Australia, Canada, Costa Rica and New
Zealand also left the speech as Ahmadinejad spoke about the
terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon near Washington.  “Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of
the Iranian people, Mr. Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to
spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are
as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable,” Mark
Kornblau, spokesman for the U.S. mission to the UN, said in a
statement.  During the speech, Ahmadinejad repeated accusations he made
earlier in the week that capitalism was the cause of injustice
in the world. He also said the U.S. was building up its own
nuclear arsenal while pressuring Iran to curtail what he
described as legitimate nuclear-energy development work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
