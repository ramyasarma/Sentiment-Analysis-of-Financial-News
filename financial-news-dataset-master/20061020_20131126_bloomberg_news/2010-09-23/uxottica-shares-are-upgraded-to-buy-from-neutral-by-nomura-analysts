Luxottica Group SpA , the world’s
biggest maker of eyewear, was upgraded to “buy” from
“neutral” at Nomura Holdings Inc., which cited “prospects for
stronger growth, margin expansion, unique/dominant position, top
management team.”  The brokerage also said in a note today that “Luxottica is
relatively underexposed to emerging markets compared with core
luxury names,” but it is “well-placed to capitalize on market
positioning and see this area grow in importance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
