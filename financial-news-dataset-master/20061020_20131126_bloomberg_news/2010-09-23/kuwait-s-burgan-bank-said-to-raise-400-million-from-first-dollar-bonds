Kuwait’s Burgan Bank SAK , a lender
part-owned by Kuwait Projects Co., raised $400 million in the
first overseas sale of U.S. dollar bonds to take advantage of a
decline in borrowing costs.  The bank sold 10-year subordinated notes maturing in
September 2020 to yield 8.125 percent, or 560.6 basis points
over similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, Bloomberg data shows.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered Plc
managed the sale.  Bond sales are picking up in the Persian Gulf after Dubai
World reached an agreement with 99 percent of its creditors this
month to restructure $24.9 billion of debt.  Qatar Islamic Bank
SAQ , the Gulf state’s biggest Shariah-compliant lender, plans to
sell its first dollar sukuk and will start meeting investors
tomorrow, according to a statement from the lender.  “The market is liquid and there is a lot of cash looking
to be put to work,” said  Abdul Kadir Hussain , chief executive
officer in Dubai at Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. “Pricing was fair
given that it’s a subordinated debt issue, and was the first
subordinated debt issue from the region in a while.”  The lender in 2002 sold 30 million dinars ($105 million) of
five-year bonds that matured in April 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Declining Yields  Proceeds from the sale will be used to strengthen the
bank’s “business locally as well as supporting its expansion
strategy, which has primarily targeted high growth markets” in
the Middle East and North Africa, Burgan Bank Chairman  Majed Essa Al Ajeel  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Borrowers from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council
including Qatar and Bahrain, sold $16 billion of bonds so far in
2010, compared with $22.2 billion in the year-earlier period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kuwait Projects Co., the country’s biggest privately-owned
investment company, in July sold $500 million of 10-year debt to
yield 647.3 basis points over similar-maturity Treasuries. The
spread has narrowed 56 basis points this month to 5.68
percentage points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
securities yielded 8.19 percent today, the data shows.  The  spread , or extra yield, investors demand to hold
 emerging-market  securities rather than Treasuries narrowed 14
basis points this month to 2.89 percentage points today,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ Index. It sank to 2.31
percentage points on April 15, the lowest level since December
2007. A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.  Burgan Bank’s dollar bonds were rated a preliminary BBB at
Standard & Poor’s on Sept. 22, the second-lowest investment
grade. Moody’s Investors Service gave the subordinated notes an
A3 rating, the fourth-lowest investment grade ranking, with a
negative outlook.  The bank posted a second-quarter loss of 8.7 million dinars
after a profit of 760,000 dinars in the year-earlier period, it
said Aug. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
