Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.  climbed the
most in two months in Nasdaq trading after forecasting third-
quarter profit that may exceed some analysts’ estimates and
projecting faster full-year growth.  Earnings in the quarter that began Aug. 29 may range from
61 cents to 65 cents, the Union, New Jersey-based company said
yesterday in a statement after the markets closed. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg  estimated  64 cents on average. Full-year
earnings-per-share may advance by 20 percent, compared with a
June projection of 15 percent, the company said.  The home-furnishings retailer is “cautiously optimistic”
about the second half, Chief Executive Officer  Steven Temares 
told analysts yesterday on a conference call. He said
unemployment and the economic outlook may “continue to pressure
consumers and affect their spending.”  The shares increased $1.69, or 4 percent, to $43.74 at
10:57 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, after advancing as
much as 4.6 percent, the biggest intraday jump since July 22.
The stock gained 9.1 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
