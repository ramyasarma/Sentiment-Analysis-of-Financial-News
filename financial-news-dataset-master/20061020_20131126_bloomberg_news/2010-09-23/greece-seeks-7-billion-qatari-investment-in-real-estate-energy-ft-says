more than $7 billion from Qatar in real estate, energy and
tourism, the Financial Times reported, citing an unnamed Athens

Minister  George Papandreou  and Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al- Thani , Emir of Qatar, “shows that Greece is a place that can
attract credible investors,” the official said, according to
the FT.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
