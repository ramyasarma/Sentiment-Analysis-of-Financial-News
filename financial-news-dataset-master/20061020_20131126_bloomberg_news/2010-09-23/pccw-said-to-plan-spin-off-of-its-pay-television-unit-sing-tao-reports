PCCW Ltd. plans to seek a separate
listing for its pay-television unit, Sing Tao Daily reported,
citing people it didn’t identify. PCCW may list its Now TV unit
on Hong Kong’s Growth Enterprise Market board instead of the
main board because of profitability requirements, according to
the report. PCCW Chairman Richard Li didn’t reply to requests
for comment, while Managing Director Alex Arena declined to
comment, Sing Tao said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
