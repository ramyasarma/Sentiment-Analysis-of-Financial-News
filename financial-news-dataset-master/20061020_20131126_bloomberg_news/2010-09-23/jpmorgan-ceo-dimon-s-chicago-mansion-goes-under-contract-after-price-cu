The Chicago mansion owned by  Jamie Dimon , chairman and chief executive officer of  JPMorgan Chase &
Co ., went under contract for an undisclosed amount after the
price was cut by about $2.6 million.  A sales agreement for the Gold Coast neighborhood home is
pending, Janet Owen, the listing agent at Sudler Sotheby’s
International Realty, said in an e-mail yesterday. She declined
to comment further. The property was taken off the market and
put under contract on Sept. 21, according to a local multiple
listing service report.  The eight-bedroom property was listed at $6.95 million by
Sudler Sotheby’s, after having an asking price of $9.5 million
earlier this year. It was previously advertised at $10.5 million
by Koenig & Strey GMAC Real Estate.  Dimon and his wife, Judith, bought the house in 2000 for
$4.7 million, according to records on the website of the Cook
County Recorder of Deeds. The mansion, which has nine full
bathrooms, was built in the late 1800s and is near Lake Michigan
and Oak Street Beach. Dimon first listed it for sale in April
2007 for $13.5 million.  Thomas Kelly , a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment.  The contract was reported yesterday by Crain’s Chicago
Business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
