U.K. stocks erased gains, as
declines by Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Shire Plc offset gains
by Randgold Resources Ltd. and Experian Plc.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index was little changed, slipping
less than 0.1 percent to 5,551.28 at 8:56 a.m. in London, after
earlier climbing as much as 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
