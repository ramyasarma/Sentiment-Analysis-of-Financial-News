Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. further reduced its stake in  Moody’s Corp. , continuing a
selloff after the billionaire said the ratings company had lost
some of its competitive advantage.  Berkshire, the  largest investor  in Moody’s, sold 560,000
shares on Sept. 20 at an average price of $25.73, cutting its
stake to 28.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The sale
leaves Omaha, Nebraska-based  Berkshire  with about 12 percent of
the stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in June called New
York-based Moody’s a “triple-A factory,” assigning top ratings
to residential mortgage-backed securities from 2000 that were
later cut. Buffett said the same month that Moody’s may no
longer be “bullet proof,” and the firm mistakenly assumed that
U.S. housing prices couldn’t fall nationwide.  Moody’s fell 0.4 percent to $25.44 in New York trading
yesterday. The stock has fallen 5.1 percent this year.  Buffett has sold Moody’s stock throughout this year,
including 1.35 million shares  this month , reducing a stake that
had remained steady at 48 million shares since 2000. The holding
had a value of $3.5 billion at its high in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
