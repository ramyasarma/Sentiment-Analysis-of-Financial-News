Bank of America Corp ., the largest
U.S. bank, formed a futures and derivatives clearing services
group in anticipation of greater demand in the $615 trillion
over-the-counter derivatives market.  Bob Burke  and  Gonzalo Chocano  were named co-heads of the
group, reporting to  Denis Manelski  and  Syl Chackman , co-heads of
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s global markets financing and
futures platform, according to a statement today. The new group
contacted more than 3,000 clients in its planning over the past
year, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said.  Congress sought to regulate over-the-counter derivatives,
including swaps, after the trades complicated efforts to solve
the financial crisis. Creating clearinghouses and transparent
trading systems are components of the new rules.  “Establishing an industry-leading derivatives clearing
service is a top priority for our global markets business,”  Tom Montag , president of global banking and markets, said in the
statement. “Every client we serve will be impacted by the
financial reforms transforming the OTC derivatives market.”
