Alessandro Profumo  didn’t resign as
chief executive officer of UniCredit SpA because of divisions
between managers over Libyan holdings in the bank, Chairman
 Dieter Rampl  told Corriere della Sera in an interview.  “Libya as an investor has never been an issue,” Rampl
said in the interview. The problem was “the way in which new
investors came in.”  Rampl said he isn’t able to discuss the reasons for
Profumo’s departure due to a confidentiality agreement.  Rampl said he was informed in an April 2009 meeting with
Profumo and the head of the Libyan Central Bank of a “general
interest” in buying a stake in UniCredit. He said he expressed
opposition to any stake of more than 5 percent and didn’t know
that the Libyan Investment Authority would also buy shares, the
newspaper reported.  The selection of a new CEO for UniCredit is a “question of
weeks at the most,” Rampl said.  Rampl said pressure from the Northern League’s  Umberto Bossi  and other politicians didn’t influence UniCredit’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
