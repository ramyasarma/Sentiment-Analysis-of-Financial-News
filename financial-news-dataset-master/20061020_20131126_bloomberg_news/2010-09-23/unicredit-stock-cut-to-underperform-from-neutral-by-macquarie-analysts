UniCredit SpA , Italy’s biggest
bank, was downgraded to “underperform” from “neutral” at
Macquarie Group Ltd. It said Chief Executive Officer Alessandro
Profumo’s resignations is “negative for the stock due to the
lack of a replacement and the growing political influence on the
bank.”  The brokerage, which trimmed its price estimate to 1.7
euros from 2.1 euros, also said “UniCredit should deliver
structurally low profitability in the next two years,”
according to a note dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
