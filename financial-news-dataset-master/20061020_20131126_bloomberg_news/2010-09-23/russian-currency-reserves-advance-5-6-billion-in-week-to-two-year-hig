Russia’s  international reserves 
rose to the highest level since October 2008 as the
strengthening euro caused a currency revaluation.  The value of the world’s third-largest stockpile jumped
$5.6 billion in the week ended Sept. 17 to $481.3 billion, the
largest gain in two months, after dropping $1.6 billion in the
previous week, Bank Rossii  said  on its website today.  The gain in reserves was “purely due to valuation
changes” in the euro and the dollar, which accounted for about
$4.9 billion of the gain,  Clemens Grafe , chief economist in
Moscow at UBS AG, said by telephone. Central bank interventions
accounted for the rest of the increase, according to UBS.  The euro gained 2.9 percent against the greenback last week
for the biggest weekly advance since May 22, 2009. U.S. dollars
made up 46.4 percent of Russia’s foreign currency holdings at
the end of last year, while euros accounted for 42.3 percent,
British pounds 10.1 percent and Japanese yen 1.2 percent, the
central bank said on Aug. 23.  Bank Rossii used up more than a third of its reserves from
August 2008 until January 2009 to manage the ruble’s decline
before accepting a wider trading band. The stockpile has gained
$105.2 billion from a record low $376.1 on March 13, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
