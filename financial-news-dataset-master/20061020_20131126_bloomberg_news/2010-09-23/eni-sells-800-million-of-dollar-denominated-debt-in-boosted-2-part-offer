Eni SpA, Italy’s biggest oil
company, sold $800 million of dollar denominated debt in a
boosted two-part offering, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  A $450 million portion of 10-year notes yields 162.5 basis
points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, and $350
million of 30-year bonds pay a spread of 200 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Eni previously offered $750 million of debt, according to a
person familiar with the transaction who declined to be
identified because the marketing was private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
