China committed itself to mineral-
processing projects in South Africa following President  Jacob Zuma ’s recent state visit to the Asian country,  Sake24  reported,
citing Economic Development Minister  Ebrahim Patel .  The two nations will hold talks “in coming months” about
establishing partnerships between Chinese and South African
companies, the Johannesburg-based news agency said. Government
officials from the two countries have already held talks about
altering “trade structures” to allow for more “value-added”
exports from South Africa to China, Sake24 quoted Patel as
saying.  China wants “security of supply” of mineral resources from
South Africa, the news agency added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
