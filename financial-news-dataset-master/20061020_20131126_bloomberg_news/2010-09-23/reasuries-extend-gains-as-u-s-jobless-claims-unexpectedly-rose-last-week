Treasuries gained, pushing the 10-
year note yield below 2.50 percent for the first time in three
weeks, on speculation the Federal Reserve may increase purchases
of U.S. debt to support the economy.  The 10-year  note  advanced for a fifth day in its longest
winning streak in about a year as initial jobless claims
unexpectedly climbed last week. Two-year note yields were within
a basis point of the  record low  two days after the central bank
said it’s willing to ease monetary policy further.  “For the next two or three weeks, every single economic
statistic will be picked over, and anything showing weakness
will lead to market rallies and lower yields,” said  Ray Remy ,
head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Securities Group Inc.,
one of the 18 primary dealers that trade directly with the
central bank. “Everybody will expect the Fed to step in, step
in at any second.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield dropped 1 basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.56 percent at 5:17 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in August 2020 rose 2/32, or 63 cents
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 18/32.  The yield touched 2.48 percent, the  lowest level  since
Sept. 1. The 2-year yield slid 2 basis points to 0.42 percent,
compared with the record 0.41 percent reached yesterday. The 30-
year bond yield fell 2 basis points to 3.73 percent.  Jobless Claims  Treasuries rose after the Labor Department reported that
initial jobless  claims  increased to 465,000 in the week ended
Sept. 18 from a revised 453,000 in the previous week. The median
forecast of 47 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for no
change in applications for unemployment benefits.  U.S. debt pared its  advance  as sales of existing homes
climbed from a record low in August and an index of leading
indicators increased more than economists forecast.  Sales  of existing U.S. homes climbed 7.6 percent in August
to an annual rate of 4.13 million, the National Association of
Realtors reported. The median forecast of 72 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 7.1 percent increase.  “The mindset is very much that the data has softened for
the last three months or so,” said Suvrat Prakash, an interest-
rate strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, a primary dealer.
“Because of that, the housing market number doesn’t do much.
That’s why we’re still richer on the day.”  The New York-based Conference Board’s gauge of the
prospects for the economy in the next three to six months rose
0.3 percent last month following a 0.1 percent increase in July.
The index was expected to rise 0.1 percent, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 56 economists.  Fed ‘Accommodation’  The Fed said in its statement on Sept. 21 that it’s
prepared “to provide additional accommodation if needed to
support economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to
levels consistent with its mandate.”  Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased in
August for a fifth month at an annual rate of 0.9 percent,
matching the slowest year-over-year rate of gains since 1966,
the Labor Department said Sept. 17.  The central bank retained its stance from its Aug. 10
meeting of keeping its portfolio of securities stable at about
$2 trillion to keep money from draining out of the financial
system. It has purchased $30.172 billion of Treasuries since
Aug. 17.  “My feeling is I want to be a buyer on dips because I do
think QE will take place in November,” said  Thomas L. di Galoma , head of U.S. rates trading in New York at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a brokerage for institutional investors.  Fed Debt Buying  The Fed completed a program of quantitative easing to
purchase $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and
about $175 billion of agency debt in March. The central bank was
the biggest buyer of Treasuries when it bought $300 billion of
U.S. debt in 2009.  The Treasury announced today that it will sell $100 billion
in two-, five- and seven-year notes at auction next week. The
government reduced two- and five-year note offerings by $1
billion to $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively, while
keeping the offering of seven-year securities at $29 billion.
The sales amounted to $102 billion the last time the government
sold this combination of securities in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
