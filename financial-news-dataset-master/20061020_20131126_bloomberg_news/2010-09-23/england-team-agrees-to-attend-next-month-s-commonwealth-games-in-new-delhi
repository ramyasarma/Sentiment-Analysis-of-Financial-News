The England team will be attending
the Commonwealth Games, Commonwealth Games England said in an e-
mailed statement.  “Commonwealth Games England and its 17 member sports today
unanimously agreed that they will go to the Delhi Games,” the
statement said.  CGE will continue to “press the organizing committee of
the Commonwealth Games Federation for assurances on both the
stadia and the accommodation as well as liaising with the
British government,” it also said.  The team may withdraw if assurances on the athletes’
village and security aren’t fulfilled and if there is a “major
structural issue,” CGE Chairman Andrew Foster said on Sky News.
