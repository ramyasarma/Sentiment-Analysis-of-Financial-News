A medium-intensity earthquake
struck central Chile at 12:37 p.m. New York time today, shaking
buildings in capital Santiago, the government said.  The temblor measured three on the Mercalli scale in
Santiago, six in the southern city of Talca and five in
Rancagua, according to  preliminary information  published by the
national emergency office known as Onemi. There were no reports
of any emergencies resulting from the quake, Onemi said.  The quake had a magnitude of 5.3, the  U.S. Geological
Survey  said on its website. The epicenter was 176 kilometers
(110 miles) south-southwest of Santiago at a depth of 44.5
kilometers, the USGS said.  State-owned copper producer Codelco had no immediate
reports of any impact to its operations, said an official who
declined to be named citing company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
