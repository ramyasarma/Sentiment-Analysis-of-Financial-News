The European Union said it
disbursed 1.15 billion euros to Romania, the third installment
of a 5 billion-euro loan that was agreed in May 2009 as part of
a multilateral financial assistance package.  The disbursement to Romania follows a positive assessment
by the European Commission of the implementation by the Romanian
authorities of the conditions agreed in the Supplemental
Memorandum of Understanding, the EU said today in a statement
issued in Brussels.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
