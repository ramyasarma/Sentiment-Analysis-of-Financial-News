Ireland’s government is considering
options for Anglo Irish Bank Corp., including allowing the
company to buy back subordinated debt, a person familiar with 
the situation said.  Anglo Irish, the Dublin-based lender taken over by the
government last year, said as recently as Sept. 8 that the bank
had sought approval from authorities to repurchase subordinated
debt. Anglo Irish generated more than 1.5 bilion euros of
profit from previous buybacks, said the person who declined to
be identified because no final decision has been made.   The government is in talks with the European Commission on
Anglo Irish, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
