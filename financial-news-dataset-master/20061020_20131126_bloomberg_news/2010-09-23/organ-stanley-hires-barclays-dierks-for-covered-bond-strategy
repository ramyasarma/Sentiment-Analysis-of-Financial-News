Morgan Stanley  is hiring  Leef Dierks  from Barclays Capital as its head of covered bond
strategy, according to three people familiar with the matter.  Dierks will join the U.S. investment bank’s London office
in January after working for Barclays in Frankfurt, said the
people, who declined to be identified before a public
announcement. He will report to  Laurence Mutkin , Morgan
Stanley’s head of European fixed-income strategy.  Marc Hazelton , a London-based spokesman at Barclays, and
Morgan Stanley spokesman  Sebastian Howell  declined to comment.  Covered bonds are notes that package mortgages or public-
sector loans into securities that also have the issuer’s promise
to pay.  To contact the reporters on this story:
