John Lipsky , the No. 2 official at
the International Monetary Fund, said global economic growth in
the second half of the year will fall short of the fund’s
forecast, predicting a “continued moderate recovery.”  “Growth has slowed in this year’s second half,” Lipsky
said in the text of a Sept. 27 speech posted on the IMF’s
website today, adding that “this sluggishness will persist into
early 2011.” The Washington-based fund had forecast growth at a
3.75 percent annual rate for the second half, he said.  The IMF plans to release growth forecasts next week and
chief economist  Olivier Blanchard  predicted Sept. 23 “positive
but low growth in advanced countries” with growth in emerging
markets “staying very high.”  Growth in the first half was “a bit” stronger than the
fund anticipated, with an annual rate of about 4.75 percent,
Lipsky said.  While the IMF expects the slowdown to be temporary, risks
to the outlook in advanced countries include renewed strains in
sovereign debt markets and weakness in real property markets,
Lipsky said.  “The process of financial sector repair is unfinished, but
successful repair will be critical to opening a path toward the
stronger and sustained growth needed to make a meaningful dent
in the current high rates of unemployment in many advanced
countries,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
