U.S. stocks trimmed losses as a
rally in technology shares and better-than-estimated data on
home sales and economic indicators helped the market recover
from an early slump.  Apple Inc. climbed for a fourth straight day, rising 1
percent, after analysts lifted their forecasts for iPad sales.
Red Hat Inc. surged 11 percent after the largest seller of Linux
software reported better-than-estimated earnings. Nvidia Corp.
rallied 4.5 percent after BMO Capital Markets advised buy shares
of the graphics-chip maker.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,132.4 at 10:54 a.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 1
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared its
decline to 11.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,727.81. The Nasdaq
Composite Index rose 0.4 percent to 2,342.77.  “It’s just a mixed picture,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who
helps oversee $13.3 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. “The latest economic figures in the U.S. are still
mixed. It’s difficult to say that we’re seeing material
strengthening of economic activity. There’s still concern about
Europe. The market will be bouncing between overbought and
oversold.”  The early slide in stocks came after widening yield spreads
for Irish and Portuguese debt and an unexpected increase in
American jobless claims fueled concern that the global recovery
is stalling.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
