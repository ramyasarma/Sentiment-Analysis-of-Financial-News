United Basalt Products Ltd. , a
Mauritian building-materials maker, said profit for the year
through June surged 59 percent as revenue increased.  Net income advanced to 236.97 million rupees ($7.8 million)
from 149.43 million rupees a year earlier, the company said in a
statement published on the  Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s  website
today. Revenue gained to 2.23 billion rupees from 2.02 billion
rupees, it said.  Performance in the 2011 financial year depends “on the
prevailing economic climate to favor the timely realization of
major infrastructure, shopping mall and other property-
development projects,” the company said.  Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth on June 22 reduced the
Indian Ocean island nation’s growth forecast for this year to
between 3.5 percent and 4 percent compared with a Central
Statistics Office forecast of 4.6 percent, citing the euro-zone
crisis. The statistics office on June 30 cut its prediction to
4.2 percent.  The company’s unit in Madagascar reported a loss of 6.5
million rupees from a profit last year and United Basalt doesn’t
expect an improvement there “unless the political and economic
climate changes drastically.” Madagascar, the world’s largest
vanilla grower and sapphire producer, has been engulfed in
political turmoil and was suspended from the African Union and
the Southern African Development Community since President Andry
Rajoelina, a 36-year-old former disc jockey, won army backing to
oust  Marc Ravalomanana  in March 2009.  Performance at the company’s Sri Lankan subsidiary, where
the loss narrowed to 14.2 million rupees, is expected to
improve, the company said.  United Basalt increased its stake in Pre-mixed Concrete
Ltd. to 49 percent from 30 percent, and also bought a further 21
percent of Dry Mixed Products Ltd., in which it how has 51
percent. Both transactions cost 99.7 million rupees, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
