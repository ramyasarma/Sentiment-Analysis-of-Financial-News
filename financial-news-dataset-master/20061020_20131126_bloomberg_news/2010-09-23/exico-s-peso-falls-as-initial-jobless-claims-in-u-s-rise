Mexico’s peso dropped for the first
time this week as initial jobless claims in the U.S., the
nation’s largest trading partner, exceeded forecasts, fueling
concern the economic recovery is slowing.  The peso dropped 0.2 percent to 12.6572 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.6287 yesterday. The loss pared the
peso’s gain this year to 3.4 percent against the dollar. The
decline was the first in four days and the biggest since Sept.
7, when the currency plunged 0.9 percent.  “The market has been focusing on the initial jobless claim
numbers more closely for the last five months,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency strategist at Base Internacional Casa de
Bolsa SA in Monterrey, Mexico. “The market went negative right
after the data today.”  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose 12,000 to 465,000
in the week ending Sept. 18, the Labor Department said today,
above the median estimate of 450,000 in a Bloomberg survey. The
U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.46 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.86 centavo to 132.81 centavos per peso.  Consumer prices in Mexico rose 0.4 percent in the first
half of September, less than the median estimate for an increase
of 0.45 percent in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  The unemployment rate dropped to 5.44 percent in August,
the national statistics agency said today. Economists had
forecast a jobless rate of 5.65 percent, according to the median
estimate of 17 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Traders triggered $113 million in dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website. So far this month, $457
million in options have been exercised.  The bank has been auctioning $600 million in options
monthly, allowing it to buy dollars as it seeks to boost foreign
reserves after the peso weakened to a record low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
