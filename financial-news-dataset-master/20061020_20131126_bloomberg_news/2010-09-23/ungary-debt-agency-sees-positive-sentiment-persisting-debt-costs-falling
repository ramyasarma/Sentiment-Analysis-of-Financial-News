Hungary’s state debt management
agency expects investors’ sentiment to remain positive toward
local debt, triggering a gradual decline in financing costs,
Gyula Pleschinger, the agency’s chief executive officer said.  “The government’s communication has been clear that the
budget deficit target will be set in stone and this helped
improve sentiment,” Pleschinger said in an interview today. “I
expect this sentiment will persist.”  Financing costs are unlikely to decline “dramatically,”
especially as bond yields in the euro zone have been increasing
lately, Pleschinger said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
