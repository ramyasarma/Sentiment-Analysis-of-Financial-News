European stocks were little
changed, paring earlier gains, as declines by banks offset a
rally in Bayer AG. U.S. futures and Asian stocks fluctuated.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.1 percent at
8:58 a.m. in London, after yesterday tumbling 1.4 percent, its
biggest loss in a month. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose 0.1 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
slipped less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
