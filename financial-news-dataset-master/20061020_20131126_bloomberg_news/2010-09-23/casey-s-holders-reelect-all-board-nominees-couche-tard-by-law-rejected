Casey’s General Stores Inc. said,
based on a preliminary vote count provided by its proxy
solicitor, shareholders have reelected by a “wide margin” all
eight of the company’s incumbent directors.  Based on these preliminary results, the Alimentation
Couche-Tard Inc. director nominees received less than 10 percent
of shares voted. These preliminary results also indicate that
shareholders have rejected Couche-Tard’s by-law proposal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
