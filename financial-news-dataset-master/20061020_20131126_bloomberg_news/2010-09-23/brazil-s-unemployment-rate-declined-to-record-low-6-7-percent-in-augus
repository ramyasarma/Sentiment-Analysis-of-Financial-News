Brazil’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly fell to a record low in August, putting pressure on
the central bank to resume interest rate increases in the first
quarter of 2011.  Unemployment fell to 6.7 percent from 6.9 percent in July,
the lowest since the government began publishing the data in
March 2002, the national statistics office said today in Rio de
Janeiro. Economists had forecast unemployment of 7 percent in a
survey of 35 analysts by Bloomberg.  Today’s result, taken with faster inflation and higher-
than-forecast bank lending, signals that the economy continues
to expand at a pace that may refuel inflation, said  Neil Shearing , a senior emerging-markets economist at Capital
Economics Ltd. Latin America’s biggest economy is heading to the
fastest expansion in more than two decades this year.  “The good growth story continues,” Shearing said in
telephone interview from London. “Clearly events over the last
month have turned in favor of monetary tightening.”  The number shows that Brazil’s economic expansion will
probably pick up speed in the fourth quarter, said  Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist at CM Capital Markets, said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  The yield on the interest rate future contract maturing in
January 2012, the most traded today on Sao Paulo’s BM&F
Exchange, rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
11.57 percent at 9:46 a.m. New York time. The real weakened 0.2
percent to 1.7214 per U.S. dollar.  Falling Rate  The jobless rate has fallen from 8.1 percent in August 2009
as the economy recovered from the worldwide economic downturn.
Brazil’s economy will grow 7.47 percent this year, its fastest
pace since 1986, according to a Sept. 17 central bank survey of
about 100 economists.  Brazil’s economy added 299,415 government-registered jobs
in August, a record for the month, up from 181,796 in July, the
Labor Ministry said Sept. 16. The ministry registered a record
1.95 million jobs for the January-August period.  Brazilian inflation as measured by the IPCA-15 index
accelerated to 4.57 percent in the year through mid-September,
the statistics agency said Sept. 21.  Bank lending rose 2.2 percent in August from the previous
month, its fastest pace since July 2009, the central bank said
in a statement yesterday.  Policy makers on Sept. 1 kept the benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 10.75 percent, after raising the Selic a total of
two percentage points over their three previous meetings to
prevent the economy from overheating.  Analysts forecast policy makers will resume rate increases
in March, lifting the Selic to 11.75 percent by June, according
to the median forecast in the central bank survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
