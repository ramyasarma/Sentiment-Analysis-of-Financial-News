Spencer Dale said that the U.K. faces “substantial headwinds”
and the economy needs “sustained” growth before companies will
see normal order books, the Western Mail reported.  “For businesses to feel like their orders books are closer
to normal capacity, we need to see a sustained period of strong
growth,” the Mail cited him as saying in an interview. 
“There are substantial headwinds, we are undertaking major
fiscal consolidation and banks are still in a position where
they can’t lend yet.”  Dale said that that output figures in the first half were
“encouraging” and he wasn’t focusing on the prospect of a
double-dip slump, the newspaper reported.  “The main risk I think is not about what the growth rate
has been, but rather will we see this sustained period of robust
growth to get the level of GDP back to normal,’’ he said,
according to the newspaper.   The government’s budget squeeze to curb the record deficit
was the correct thing to do, otherwise there was a risk of
higher interest rates and inflation, the Mail cited Dale as
saying.    To contact the reporter on this story:
