Blockbuster Inc. , which aims to cut
debt in bankruptcy to about $125 million, from $1.46 billion,
wants to pay fees to lenders and their advisers without asking a
judge’s permission, according to a court filing.  The company said today it also seeks to be able to alter
the terms of its bankruptcy loan without court approval, as long
as the changes “do not materially and adversely impair” its
rights as a bankrupt company.  The fees include non-refundable payments to creditors who
provide $125 million for Blockbuster to reorganize and parties
willing to step in if the money isn’t advanced, along with
“reasonable fees and expenses” of lawyers, financial advisers
and other professionals hired by the lenders or the agent for
the loan, according to the filing.  The so-called backstop lenders who guarantee the
$125 million loan get 1.5 percent of the amount for standing by
to lend, plus additional amounts later. Other fees weren’t
specified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
