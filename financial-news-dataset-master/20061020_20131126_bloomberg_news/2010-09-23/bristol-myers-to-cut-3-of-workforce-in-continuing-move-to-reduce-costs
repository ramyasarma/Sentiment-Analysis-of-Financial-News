Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , the New
York-based drugmaker, said it will cut 3 percent of its global
workforce, about 840 jobs, during the next six months.  “The ultimate goal of the effort is not only to reduce
cost, but also to create an organization that is more agile,”
 Tracy Furey , a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman, said today in an e-
mail. Before the cuts, Bristol has 28,000 workers, she said.  The company previously announced plans to slash more than
$2.5 billion in expenses by 2012, and eliminated 7,000 jobs last
year. Bristol-Myers is narrowing its focus on biotechnology and
making acquisitions to replace medicines facing generic
competition during the next two years.  “These companies get smaller and realize they can still
cut more jobs to become even more efficient,”  Linda Bannister ,
an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in Des Peres, Missouri, said in
a telephone interview. “With the patent cliff all these
companies are facing, they need to reduce costs as quickly as
possible to navigate what is going to be a very challenging
couple of years for the industry.”  The company fell 14 cents, to $27.68, at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has  advanced  24
percent in 12 months.  Furey declined to specify the positions to be eliminated or
to comment on the effect of the job cuts on the company’s
financial results.  To contact the reporters on this story:
