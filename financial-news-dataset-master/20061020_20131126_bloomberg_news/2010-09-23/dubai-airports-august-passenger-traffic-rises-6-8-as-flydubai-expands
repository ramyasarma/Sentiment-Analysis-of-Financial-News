Dubai Airports, home to the biggest
Arab airline Emirates, said passenger traffic grew 6.8 percent
in August from a year ago mainly because of the expansion of
budget carrier FlyDubai.  Passenger traffic increased to 3.98 million from 3.73
million in the year-earlier period, the state-run facility said
in an e-mailed statement today. Cargo handled by the airport
jumped 21.5 percent to 198,543 tons.  FlyDubai is now the second-largest source of passenger
traffic at Dubai International Airport, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
