President Barack Obama said Iran
must give a clear demonstration of its promise of the peaceful
intent of its nuclear program.  While the U.S. and other nations remain willing to
negotiate, the government of Iran must recognize that there will
be consequences for its actions, Obama said in an address to the
United Nations General Assembly in New York.  “The door remains open to diplomacy should Iran choose to
walk through it,” Obama said. “But the Iranian government must
demonstrate a clear and credible commitment, and confirm to the
world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
