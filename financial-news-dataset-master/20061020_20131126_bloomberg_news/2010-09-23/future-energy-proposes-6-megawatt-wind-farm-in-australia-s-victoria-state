Future Energy Pty Ltd. plans to
build a 6 megawatt wind farm near Ballarat in Australia’s
Victoria state.  The Chepstowe project would generate enough power for 3,400
homes, according to a proposal posted on the website of
Australia’s Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and
the Arts. The wind farm would save 18,000 metric tons of carbon
dioxide emissions a year, Future Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
