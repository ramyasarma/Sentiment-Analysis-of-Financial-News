Aberdeen Asset Management Plc , the
U.K.’s largest independent fund-management company, climbed the
most in three weeks after the FT Alphaville blog reported
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. may raise its stake.  Mitsubishi UFJ may increase its holding in Aberdeen to
almost 30 percent from 16 percent, the FT said on its  Markets
Live  blog. It didn’t give a source for the information. The
stock climbed 5.4 pence, or 3.6 percent, to 154.3 pence at
12:14 p.m. in London trading, the most since Sept. 1.  Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan’s biggest bank, took a 10 percent
stake in Aberdeen in 2008 as part of a plan to distribute the
company’s products in Japan. The firm said previously it planned
to raise its stake to 19.9 percent. It’s currently the fund
manager’s second-biggest shareholder.  Aberdeen spokesman  James Thorneley  didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
