Kathmandu Holdings Ltd. , a New
Zealand-based retailer of outdoor equipment, said full-year
earnings fell 37 percent as the company cut prices to bolster
sales, reducing profit margins.  Net income fell to NZ$9.4 million ($7 million) in the year
ended July 31 from NZ$14.9 million a year earlier, the
Christchurch-based company said in a statement today. Full-year
sales rose 14 percent to NZ$245.8 million.  Kathmandu, which has 36 stores in New Zealand, 55 in
Australia and six in the U.K., said there was a “challenging”
economic environment in all three countries it operates in and
same-store sales contracted in the second half. The company
expects consumer demand to improve and plans as many as 15 new
outlets in the current year to further boost earnings.  “We’ll be targeting the same level of increase in sales
and profitability that we achieved this year,” Chief Executive
Officer  Peter Halkett  said on a conference call today, without
providing any detailed forecasts.  Kathmandu shares rose 1 cent to NZ$1.78 as at the 5 p.m.
market close in Wellington. The stock has slumped 17 percent the
past three months, the worst performer in the NZX 50 index.  In the year, the gross profit margin fell 120 basis points
on the year earlier reflecting promotions and pricing levels,
the company said. Demand was curbed by unfavorable warm weather
in Australia during the third quarter and weak trading in New
Zealand in the fourth quarter, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
