Applications for U.S. unemployment
benefits unexpectedly rose last week, a sign companies remain
cautious about hiring as economic growth slows.  Initial  jobless claims  increased by 12,000 to 465,000 in
the week ended Sept. 18, Labor Department figures showed today
in Washington. The total number of people receiving unemployment
insurance declined, while those getting extended payments rose.  Employers that have slowed firings since the recession
ended in June 2009 haven’t stepped up the pace of hiring enough
to reduce an  unemployment rate  hovering near a 26-year high. A
lack of job growth may signal consumer spending will be
restrained in the second half of the year, economists said.  “The economic recovery remains painfully slow and the
proof of this is companies are still reluctant to hire,” said
 Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. “Those who lost their jobs in
this recession will have to wait because the economy’s wheels
are not turning fast enough to employ them.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  expiring in
December extended losses after the report, declining 0.9 percent
to 1,119.50 at 8:57 a.m. in New York.  First-time claims for jobless benefits were projected to
hold at 450,000 last week, according to the median forecast of
47 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates ranged from
440,000 to 475,000. The Labor Department revised the prior
week’s figure to 453,000.  The  four-week  moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, dropped to 463,250 last week from 466,500,
the fourth straight week of declines, today’s report showed.  Continuing Claims  The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
fell by 48,000 in the week ended Sept. 11 to 4.49 million. They
were forecast to drop to 4.47 million, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended and emergency benefits under
federal programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional
benefits and are now collecting  emergency  and extended payments
increased by about 208,000 to 5.17 million in the week ended
Sept. 4.  The unemployment  rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, declined to 3.5 percent
in the week ended Sept. 11 from 3.6 percent the prior week.  Forty-four states and territories reported a decline in
claims, while nine reported an increase in the ended Sept. 11.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Unemployment Rate  Private employers in August added 67,000 workers while
total payrolls fell by 54,000, the Labor Department said earlier
this month. Unemployment rose to 9.6 percent last month, and
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast joblessness will
stay near that level for the rest of the year.  Some companies are still firing workers while others are
beginning to hire.  Textron Inc ., a Providence, Rhode Island-based maker of
airplanes, said Sept. 21 it is cutting 700 jobs and adjusting
production schedules at its Cessna unit because of continued
weakness in new orders.  “While we are seeing solid performance in most of our
other businesses, we have not yet seen a discernable improvement
in business-jet order activity,” Chief Executive Officer  Scott Donnelly  said in a statement.  Appliance Retailer  Indianapolis-based appliance and electronics retailer
 hhgregg  Inc. this week announced it was seeking to fill 50 sales
positions each at new stores in Manassas, Virginia, and Erie,
Pennsylvania.  President  Barack Obama  this month proposed a package of
$180 billion in business tax breaks and infrastructure spending
to boost job growth. That would come on top of the $814 billion
in stimulus measures enacted last year that the administration
said in July would have saved or created 3.5 million jobs by the
end of this year.  Polls reflect diminishing support for Obama and his
Democratic party ahead of midterm elections in November as
growth slows and employment stagnates. A poll by Quinnipiac
University taken Aug. 31 to Sept. 7 showed 56 percent of voters
disapproved of Obama’s handling of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
