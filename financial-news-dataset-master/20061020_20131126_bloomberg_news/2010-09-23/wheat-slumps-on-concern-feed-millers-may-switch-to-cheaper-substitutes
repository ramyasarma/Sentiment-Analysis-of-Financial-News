Wheat fell in Chicago on
speculation that world stocks suffice to meet demand, calling
the recent rally into question, and higher prices may spur users
such as animal-feed makers to seek cheaper substitutes.  December-delivery wheat dropped 1.6 percent to $7.085 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris time.
Prices advanced to a 23-month high last month.  The most-active contract has shed 4 percent since Sept. 9,
the day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its
estimate for global wheat stocks on lower demand for feed use.
Wheat rose as high as $8.68 a bushel last month after Russia,
the third-largest grower last year, announced a ban on exports.  “Supplies, while not as significant as we were expecting
at the start of the year, are still at reasonably comfortable
levels when we look across the globe as a whole,”  Luke Mathews ,
a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said by phone
from Sydney today. “We must question whether we are in a
situation that warrants U.S. wheat prices above $7 a bushel.”  The USDA this month lifted its estimate for global wheat
stocks at the end of 2010-11 by 3 million metric tons to 177.8
million tons.  Milling wheat for November delivery fell 1.9 percent to
223.50 euros ($297.81) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  Corn for December delivery declined 1.5 percent to $4.975
a bushel in Chicago. November-delivery soybeans slipped 0.3
percent to $10.85 a bushel, erasing an advance as high as
$10.9825, near a 15-month high for the most-active contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
