The Australian dollar will rise to
a record and exceed parity with the U.S. currency as low
volatility and the widening yield advantage boosts demand for
the so-called Aussie, Commonwealth Bank of Australia said today.  The Aussie will reach 97 U.S. cents by the end of this year
and then rise to $1.02 by March 2011, analysts led by  Richard Grace , chief currency strategist in Sydney, wrote in a note to
clients. Commonwealth Bank also increased its forecast for the
New Zealand dollar, which will rise to 74 U.S. cents by December
and 76 cents by March, according to the report.  “Low market volatility, widening Australia-U.S. interest
rates and firm 2011 Asia-led global growth suggest Australian
dollar upside,” Grace and Sydney-based  Joseph Capurso  wrote.
“The Australian dollar will rise through parity to the U.S.
dollar by early 2011.”  Australia’s dollar fetched 95.56 U.S. cents as of 2:27 p.m.
in Sydney from 95.68 cents yesterday, when it reached as high as
96 cents, the most since July 2008. The median estimate of
analysts polled by Bloomberg News is for the currency to decline
to 88 U.S. cents by year-end, where it is predicted to remain
into the first quarter of 2011.  The Aussie reached its record high of 98.50 cents in July
2008. It fell to as low as 60.09 cents three months later as the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. froze credit markets
and prompted investors to dump higher-yielding assets.  Yield Spreads  The Aussie dollar has gained 7.3 percent this month as a
Credit Suisse AG  index  shows that swaps traders increased to 44
percent the chance that the Reserve Bank of Australia will
increase its  benchmark rate  when it meets Oct. 5.  Investors have also purchased the currency amid growing
speculation the Federal Reserve will expand monetary stimulus
measures to spur U.S. growth.  Australia ’s benchmark rate is 4.5 percent, compared with as
low as zero in the U.S., attracting investors to the South
Pacific nation’s assets. The  extra yield  investors get by
purchasing two-year Australian government debt compared to
similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries climbed to 4.40 percentage
points today, the most since June 2008.  “The medium-term economic outlook suggests the Australia-
U.S. two-year bond spread will remain at elevated levels for an
extended period of time,” the Commonwealth Bank analysts wrote.  The bank’s previous forecast was for the Aussie to fall to
88 U.S. cents by December and 87 cents by March next year.  Australian policy makers expect the economy’s annual growth
rate to accelerate to 4 percent by the end of 2012. The
International Monetary Fund forecasts the U.S. will expand 2.5
percent that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
