Canada’s dollar depreciated to a
three-week low as investors shunned higher-yielding assets as
reports in Europe and U.S. added to investor’s dimming views on
the sustainability of the global economic recovery.  Canada’s currency fell 0.7 percent during five days, the
worst performer among the U.S. dollar’s 16 most-traded
counterparts. Reports this week showed inflation rose slower
than forecast in August and retail sales unexpectedly fell in
July. The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, rallied from its
weakest level as global stocks advanced.  “A dash of ‘risk off’ with the economic data out of
Europe” is weighing on the Canadian dollar,  David Watt , senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets, said via e-mail. Recent Canadian data “suggests a very
humbling start to the third quarter.”  The Canadian currency depreciated as much as 0.7 percent to
C$1.0380 per U.S. dollar, the lowest level since Sept. 9, before
trading down 0.3 percent to C$1.0335 at 4:17 p.m. in Toronto,
compared with C$1.0308 yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 96.76
U.S. cents.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 0.8 percent.  CIBC Forecast  The Canadian currency will weaken to 92 U.S. cents as the
economy expands less than 2 percent in each of the next three
quarters through March 2011, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
said yesterday. The economy will grow only 1.9 percent in 2011,
CIBC said.  “As a result, the Bank of Canada will wait until spring
before renewing a very gradualist path to normalcy in interest
rates,” CIBC chief economist  Avery Shenfeld  wrote in the report
yesterday.  Canadian central bank policy makers have raised interest
rates three times since June 1 to 1 percent from a record low
0.25 percent. They next meet Oct. 19 to determine rates.  “The Bank of Canada looks more and more likely to put the
tightening campaign on ice,” Watt said.  The spread between U.S. Treasuries and 2-year Canadian
government bonds narrowed six basis points yesterday to 98 basis
points after a report showed retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.1
percent in July, calling into question the strength of Canada’s
recovery. The  yield gap  widened to 100 basis points today.  Bond Yields  Canada’s benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped 3 basis
points to 2.83 percent today as the price of the 3.5 percent
security due in June 2020 rose 27 cents to C$105.66.  The greenback rose against 11 of its 16 major counterparts,
climbing the most against the Norwegian krone. Canada’s currency
dropped 0.4 percent to C$1.6208 against the British pound and
lost 0.4 percent to 81.60 yen.  “With the Canadian dollar left without any fundamental
drivers until next week’s industrial price and July GDP data,
the tone set by broad U.S. dollar movements will take
precedence,”  Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist in Toronto at
Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit, wrote in a note to
clients.  The loonie extended losses after U.S. Labor Department
figures showed applications for unemployment benefits
unexpectedly rose last week, a sign companies remain tentative
about hiring as economic growth slows.  Initial jobless claims increased by 12,000 to 465,000 in
the week ended Sept. 18. The total number of people receiving
unemployment insurance declined, while those getting extended
payments rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
