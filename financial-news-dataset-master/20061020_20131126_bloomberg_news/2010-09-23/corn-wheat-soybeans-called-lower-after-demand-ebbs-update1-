What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 7 cents to 8 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade after a government report
showed less export demand for U.S. grain, said  Mark Schultz , the
chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange after rains improved soil moisture for winter-
crop prospects from Romania to Kazakhstan, Schultz said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that global demand may slow after prices
rose to a 15-month high this week, Schultz said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $2 to $3 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open steady to up 0.1 cent a pound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
