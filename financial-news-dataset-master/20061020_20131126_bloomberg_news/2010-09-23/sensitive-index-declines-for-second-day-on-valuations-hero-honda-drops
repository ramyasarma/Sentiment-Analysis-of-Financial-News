Indian stocks advanced as investors
judged the nation’s economic growth outlook provides a haven for
equities after a drop in U.S. jobless rates damped the outlook
for global expansion.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. , the local unit of the world’s
second-largest consumer-goods maker, climbed for a seventh day
to its highest level in at least 19 years.  DLF Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest real estate developer, advanced 5 percent, its
steepest gain since May. India’s government lifted the cap on
foreign investment in bonds to increase funds available for
roads and power plants.  “Investors have looked at the quality of companies in
India and clearly they’re much better than what we see elsewhere
in the region,” said  Rahul Chadha , head of India equities at
Mirae Asset Global Investment, in a Bloomberg Television
interview today. “It’s a good structural story with strong
domestic consumption and the economy remains in a sweet spot.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
rose 184.17, or 0.9 percent, to 20,045.18, completing its
longest weekly winning streak since April 9. The gauge has
climbed 25 percent from a May 25 low, helping it breach 20,000
this week for the first time since January 2008, and putting it
on course for its longest stretch of quarterly gains since at
least 1979.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
advanced 1 percent to 6,018.30. The  BSE 200 Index  added 0.9
percent to 2,532.46.  Spending Plans  Hindustan Unilever advanced 3.8 percent to 314.95 rupees,
its highest close since at least January 1991.  DLF  added 5
percent to 365.25 rupees, its steepest gain since May 10.  The foreign limit on government bonds due in more than five
years was doubled to $10 billion, the Ministry of Finance said
late yesterday. Investors were also allowed to buy $5 billion
more obligations with similar maturities sold by infrastructure
companies, boosting the permitted amount in corporate debentures
to $20 billion.  India plans to double spending on building infrastructure
projects to $1 trillion in the five years to 2017, according the
country’s Planning Commission. The economy expanded 8.8 percent
last quarter from a year earlier, the most among major economies
after China and Brazil.  Valuations  U.S. applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly
rose last week, a sign companies in the world’s largest economy
remain cautious about hiring as growth slows. The U.S. has
fallen behind emerging markets in Brazil and India as the
preferred place to invest, a September Bloomberg poll showed,
while still ranking highest among all major developed countries.  Foreign  fund  inflows to India’s equities have increased 64
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China. Stocks on the Sensex are valued at 19 times
earnings, compared with 13 times for Brazil’s Bovespa Index, 7.7
times for Russia’s Micex Index and 15.9 times for China’s
Shanghai Composite Index.  “Whether the market is going to fall or rise will depend
on the fund inflows,” said  Yogesh Radke , head of quantitative
research at Edelweiss Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “The current
rally has been driven by foreign investors.”   Overseas  funds
bought a net 15.1 billion rupees ($331 million) of Indian
equities on Sept. 22, taking total investments in the stocks
this year to 802.4 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  Foreigners have invested 208.6 billion rupees in equities
this month, compared with 116.9 billion rupees in August. The
flows pushed the Sensex to the  highest  level in more than 2 1/2
years on Sept. 21 and helped the rupee rebound 4.8 percent from
an eight-month low in May. Equity purchases this year include
216.4 billion rupees from the primary market, the regulator said.  Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
