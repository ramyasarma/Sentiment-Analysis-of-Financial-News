Statoil ASA , Norway’s biggest oil
and gas producer, paid Nautical Petroleum Plc 87.5 million
pounds ($137 million) for a 21 percent stake in the North Sea
Mariner field as it seeks to raise production abroad.  Statoil, operator of the Mariner and Bressay heavy-oil
fields, will hold 65.1 percent in Mariner after the transaction,
while Nautical will keep 6 percent, the Stavanger-based company
said today in a  statement . The Norwegian producer will also pay
Nautical as much as 3 million pounds in costs up to the final
investment decision within two years, it said.  “The increased ownership in Mariner gives an even stronger
position in offshore heavy oil, a core area in Statoil’s
international growth strategy,”  Peter Mellbye , Statoil’s head
of international exploration and production, said in the
statement.  Statoil, which operates about 80 percent of Norway’s oil
and gas production, is expanding abroad to counter declining
domestic output. The company’s reserve-replacement ratio hasn’t
been above 100 percent since 2005. The company this year sold a
stake in its Brazilian Peregrino field to China’s Sinochem Group
for $3.07 billion and raised $2 billion in a bond sale to
“increase the financial flexibility.”  Statoil rose 0.1 krone to 122.9 kroner as of 10:31 a.m. in
Oslo. Nautical soared as much as 28 percent to 399.75 pence, the
highest since March 2003, and traded at 372 pence as of 9:31
a.m. in London.  The producer became operator of Mariner and Bressay in 2007
and has drilled and tested one successful appraisal well at
Bressay and performed two seismic studies at Mariner,
“confirming material volumes in the area,” the company said.  The fields are estimated to hold at least 450 million
barrels of recoverable resources and production would start in
2015 at about 55,000 barrels of oil a day, Lars Helge Floelo,
Statoil’s project manager for U.K. heavy oil, said today by
phone. Floelo estimates development costs at “roughly $9-10
billion.”  Statoil is in the process of evaluating production concepts
and will make a decision by year-end, Floelo said. The company
is likely to place a fixed installation at each field and will
hold bidding rounds at the turn of 2011-2012, Floelo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
