China’s government has put an
embargo on sales to Japan of rare earths, minerals used in
hybrid cars and electrics parts, because of a dispute over
detention of a fishing captain, the New York Times reported
today, citing industry figures it didn’t name.  Chinese customs halted mineral shipments because Japan has
refused to free a Chinese fishing captain  who is being held
after his boat collided with coast guard vessels in waters near
islands claimed by both nations, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
