South Africa, the biggest corn
producer on the continent, cut its corn crop  forecast  to 13.04
million metric tons from 13.09 million tons.  Farmers may reap 7.82 million tons of white corn, unchanged
from an earlier forecast, and 5.22 million tons of yellow corn,
1 percent less than previously estimated, Marda Scheepers, an
official at the government’s  Crop Estimates Committee , said by
phone from Pretoria today.  Analysts had forecast that the size of South Africa’s corn
crop would be reduced to 12.9 million tons in the season that
started on May 1, according to the median estimate of 10 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg. Forecasts ranged from 12.5 million tons
to 13.09 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
