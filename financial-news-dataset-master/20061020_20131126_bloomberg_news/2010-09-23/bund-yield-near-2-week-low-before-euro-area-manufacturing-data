German bonds rose after the nation
said it will sell less debt than previously planned and bonds
from periphery euro-area nations slumped as manufacturing growth
slowed, boosting demand for the safest assets.  The 10-year bund yield fell to a two-week low as Germany
cut scheduled fourth-quarter issuance of bonds and bills by 33
percent to 60 billion euros ($80 billion). A Markit Economics
composite index of services and manufacturing slid to 53.8 from
56.2 in August, less than economist estimates for a reading of
55.7. The extra yield investors demand to hold Portuguese and
Irish 10-year debt instead of German bonds reached a record.  “This is by far the largest change to the downside I can
remember” for debt sales, said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “It should definitely be
a positive factor for the bund market in addition to the data
which have been quite weak.”  The 10-year bund yield dropped 6 basis points to 2.28
percent, the lowest since Sept. 9, as of 4:05 p.m. in London.
The 2.25 percent security due in September 2020 rose 0.56, or
5.60 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.72. The two-year
note yield also fell 6 basis points, to 0.69 percent.  The yield on the Euribor futures contract expiring in
December 2011 fell six basis points to 1.27 percent as investors
added to bets for lower borrowing costs.  Investors are shunning the debt of so-called periphery
nations in favor of the safest fixed-income assets including
bunds on concern a slower economic recovery may dent their
efforts to rein in their budget deficits. Greece abandoned
attempts to auction bonds in April and turned to the European
Union and International Monetary Fund for aid.  Growth Outlook  Ireland’s  gross domestic product  shrank 1.2 percent in the
three months through June compared with the first quarter, the
country’s statistics office said today. Applications for U.S.
unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, according to
Labor Department figures today. Data yesterday showed European
industrial orders declined in July more than economists
estimated and consumer confidence in the region improved less
than economists forecast.  “An increasingly lackluster growth outlook is enough to
make people think, ‘how on earth are they going to extricate
themselves from these situations?’” said  John Davies , a fixed-
income strategist at WestLB AG in London. “If the growth
doesn’t come through fast enough it’s not good for the deficits
nor for the banking-sector outlook.”  The Irish-German  spread  widened to a record 418 basis
points, or 4.18 percentage points, from 394 points yesterday.
The Portuguese-German spread also reached a record, at 402 basis
points. The Italian-German spread increased 6 basis points to
160 basis points, and the Spanish 10-year-bund gap rose 5 basis
points to 183 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 countries increased to 165 basis points,
nearing its record high of 168.5 basis points.  Ireland auctioned 400 million euros of bills today, less
than the maximum sought by the debt agency. It sold 300 million
euros of securities due in February 2011 at an average yield of
1.907 percent, compared with 1.925 percent at a Sept. 9 sale. It
auctioned 100 million euros of bills maturing in April 2011 at
an average yield of 2.23 percent, up from 2.19 percent at the
previous sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
