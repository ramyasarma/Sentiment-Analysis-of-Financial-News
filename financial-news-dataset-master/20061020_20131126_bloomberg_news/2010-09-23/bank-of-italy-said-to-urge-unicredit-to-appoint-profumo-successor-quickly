The Bank of Italy urged  UniCredit
SpA , Italy’s largest bank, to move quickly in naming a successor
to Chief Executive Officer  Alessandro Profumo , three people with
knowledge of the matter said.  The Rome-based central bank, in a letter, asked UniCredit
to explain the executive powers assumed by Chairman  Dieter Rampl , who replaced Profumo as interim CEO yesterday, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the communication
was private. The Bank of Italy called for a “rapid” return to
stability and asked for information on Profumo’s compensation,
they said.  Profumo, 53, stepped down this week after relations soured
with some of the bank’s largest Italian shareholders over Libyan
investments in the company. UniCredit won’t be influenced by
“any pressure” on how to replace Profumo, a succession that
will be managed quickly “but with great diligence,” Rampl, 63,
said in a letter to employees yesterday.  Central bank and UniCredit officials declined to comment.
The central bank’s letter was reported earlier today by Italian
newspapers including Corriere della Sera.  To contact the reporters on this story:
