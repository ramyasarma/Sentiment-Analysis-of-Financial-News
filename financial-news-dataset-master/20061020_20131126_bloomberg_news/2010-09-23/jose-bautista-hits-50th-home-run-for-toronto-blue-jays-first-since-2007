Toronto’s  Jose Bautista  hit his
50th home run of the season in today’s game against Seattle,
becoming the first Major League Baseball player in three years
to reach the milestone.  Bautista, 29, extended his major league-leading total with
a solo homer off Mariners pitcher  Felix Hernandez  during the
first inning at the Rogers Centre in Toronto.  The Blue Jays’ outfielder is the  26th player  in major-
league history to hit at least 50 homers in a season and the
first since  Alex Rodriguez  (54) and  Prince Fielder  (50) in 2007.
 Barry Bonds  hit a record 73 homers in 2001.  Bautista didn’t hit more than 16 home runs in any of his
previous six major-league seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
