Henkel AG ,  Beiersdorf AG  and
competing adhesives manufacturers in Germany are forecasting a 6
percent increase in sales from existing operations this year,
driven by exports.  Industry revenue will rise to about 3.1 billion euros ($4.1
billion), the IVK trade association said today at a press
conference in Dusseldorf, Germany. The increase contrasts with a
3 percent drop last year during the recession.  Carmakers  and the electronics industry are boosting demand,
the group said. Sales abroad by German companies including
 Henkel , the world’s largest gluemaker, rose 13 percent in the
first half and led an 11 percent gain in the manufacturers’
revenue in the period. The IVK said it expects record adhesives
production this year at factories in Germany.  “The global economic recovery has brought about growing
demand for adhesives, especially in Russia, the U.S. and
China,” IVK President Boris Tasche, a Henkel executive, said at
the press conference.  Rising prices for raw materials such as crude oil are the
association’s biggest concern, according to Tasche. The IVK,
which represents adhesives manufacturers, producers of self-
adhesive tapes and glue producers, doesn’t expect any shortages
as the industry will be able to substitute some commodities with
other materials, he said.  Packaging accounted for 35 percent of adhesives-industry
revenue last year, carmaking represented 17 percent and
electronics producers 7 percent, according to the IVK.  To contact the reporter on this story:
