German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said that Germany and other euro-area members must cut
excessive budget deficits to meet their European Union
“responsibilities.”  “It is a necessary consequence and mandatory that we with
our relative weight in the EU” meet our responsibilities,
Schaeuble said in a speech in Frankfurt today. “If we aren’t up
to our responsibility we’d be a bad example. I’m in favor of us
meeting our responsibilities.”  Schaeuble said it’s important “that in the eurozone we
stay with the commitment to reduce deficits.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
