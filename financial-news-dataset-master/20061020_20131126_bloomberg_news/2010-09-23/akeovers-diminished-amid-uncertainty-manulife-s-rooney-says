Manulife Financial Corp. ’s Canadian
head  Paul Rooney  says insurers are less likely to pursue large
takeovers around the world because of uncertainty over global
accounting and capital rules.  “The prospects for big ones anywhere in the world by
anyone is greatly diminished because there are certain
uncertainties in the world right now,” said Rooney, president
and chief executive officer of Manulife Canada said during an
investor conference in Montreal hosted by CIBC.  Manulife, Canada’s largest insurer, is focusing on smaller
“tuck-in” acquisitions in Canada, and may consider larger
transactions outside North America, Rooney said.  “Elsewhere in the world, especially Asia, there could be a
possibility of things more transformational,” Rooney said.
“And in the U.S., given the state of the U.S., I would think it
would be a bigger challenge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
