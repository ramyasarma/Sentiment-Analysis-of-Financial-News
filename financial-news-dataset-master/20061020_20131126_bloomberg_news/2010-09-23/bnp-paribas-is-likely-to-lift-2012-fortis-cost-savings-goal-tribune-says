BNP Paribas SA is likely to
increase its 2012 cost-savings target from Fortis from the
current 900 million euros, La Tribune reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Savings had reached 402 million euros by the end of June, a
level that was to have been reached in 2011, the newspaper said.  The newspaper separately cited Chief Operating Officer
Jean-Laurent Bonnafe as saying that the bank will raise the
target if the time comes to do it, but for the moment an
increase is not on the agenda.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
