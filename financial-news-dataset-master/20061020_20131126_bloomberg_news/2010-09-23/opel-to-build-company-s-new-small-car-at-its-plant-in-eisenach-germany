General Motor Co. ’s Adam Opel unit
said it plans to build a new small car at its Eisenach, Germany
plant beginning in 2013 as the company boosts investment in its
model lineup to reverse losses and counter falling market share.  The new car, which will be smaller than the Corsa sub-
compact, is targeted at urban drivers focused on fuel
efficiency, Opel said in a statement. Opel will invest 90
million euros ($120 million) to allow it to build the car on the
plant’s existing production line, according to the statement.  The new model, along with an upcoming electric car, a new
“sporty coupe,” and a small SUV, is part of a plan to expand
Opel’s lineup, Chief Executive Officer  Nick Reilly  said in the
statement.  GM has pledged to invest 11 billion euros until 2014 in its
Opel and Vauxhall units to win back customers disheartened by
more than a year of uncertainty about the brands’ ownership and
funding. Opel said this month it will strengthen component and
engine production at its Kaiserslautern, Germany plant and vowed
to invest 500 million euros in engine manufacturing at the
Szentgotthard, Hungary site.  The carmaker’s factory in Zaragoza, Spain will build more
Corsas as the new car “comes on stream” in Eisenach, Opel said.
There may be an electric version of the new model in the future,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
