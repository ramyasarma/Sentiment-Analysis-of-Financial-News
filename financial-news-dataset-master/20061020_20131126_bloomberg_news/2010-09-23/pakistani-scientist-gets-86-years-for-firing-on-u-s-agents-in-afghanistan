Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani
scientist convicted of trying to kill U.S. soldiers and federal
agents in Afghanistan in 2008, was sentenced to 86 years in
prison.  U.S. District Judge Richard Berman imposed the sentence
today in New York on the American-educated Siddiqui. She was
found guilty in February of grabbing a U.S. soldier’s rifle and
firing on soldiers and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents
after being detained in Ghazni, Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
