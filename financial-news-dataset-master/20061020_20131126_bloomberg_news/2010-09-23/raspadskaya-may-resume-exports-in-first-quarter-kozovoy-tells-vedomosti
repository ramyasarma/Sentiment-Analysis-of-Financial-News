OAO Raspadskaya , a Russian producer
of steelmaking coal, may resume exports in the first quarter of
2011 after fatal blasts in May halted two-thirds of production,
Chief Executive Officer  Gennady Kozovoy  told  Vedomosti .  Exports may become possible when the company’s output
reaches about 500,000 metric tons a month, fulfilling demand
from domestic customers, Kozovoy said, according to the Moscow-
based newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
