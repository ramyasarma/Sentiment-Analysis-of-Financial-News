South Africa’s ruling African
National Congress broadly agrees on “state intervention” in
the country’s mines, deputy chairman of its economic policy
committee Enoch Godongwana said.  The party has had a “heated debate” on nationalization of
mines and is “at odds” about the form and extent of state
control of the country’s mines, Godongwana said in an interview
in the eastern port city of Durban today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
