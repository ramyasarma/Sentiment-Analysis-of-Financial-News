Former world light-welterweight
champion Ricky Hatton ’s boxing license was revoked by a British
panel after media reports about the fighter’s behavior.  “Hatton is not an active boxer and his current physical
condition is such that the board decided to withdraw his boxer’s
license,” the Cardiff, Wales-based board of control said today
in an e-mailed statement.  The 32-year-old, who lost his title to Manny Pacquiao in
2009, put out a  statement  Sept. 13 saying he was going into the
hospital for treatment after being pictured using drugs in the
previous day’s News of the World newspaper.  He was fined 20,000 pounds ($31,300) and lost his manager’s
and second’s licenses, which brought him in close contact with
boxers, the board said. He will retain his promoter’s license.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
