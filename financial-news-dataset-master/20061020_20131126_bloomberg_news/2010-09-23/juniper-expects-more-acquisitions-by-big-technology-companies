Kevin Johnson , chief executive
officer of  Juniper Networks Inc. , said he expects more
acquisitions by large technology companies as they step up
competition against one another.  Companies are trying to add a broader range of products and
services to compete with rivals that are doing the same, Johnson
said in an interview today at an analyst conference in San Jose,
California.  Juniper, which ranks second to  Cisco Systems Inc.  in the
networking-equipment market, won’t expand into areas that carry
lower  profit margins  than its current business, he said. The
company plans to focus on helping carriers and corporate
customers find cheaper ways to deal with exploding demand for
mobile Internet services.  The economic recovery will vary in “pace and trajectory,”
Johnson told analysts at the event. “But as an innovator and a
share taker, our opportunities are very good.”  Juniper, based in Sunnyvale, California, fell 9 cents to
$29.47 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange  trading . The shares
have climbed 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
