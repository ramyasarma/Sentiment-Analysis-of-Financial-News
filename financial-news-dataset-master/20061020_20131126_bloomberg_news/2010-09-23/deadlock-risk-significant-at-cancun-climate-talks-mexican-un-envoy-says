Deadlock remains a “significant”
risk at United Nations climate talks that start in November in
Mexico, a year after a summit in Copenhagen failed to produce a
binding global treaty, a top UN official said.  Proponents of a deal “seem to have accepted” that no treaty
will be written during two weeks of talks in the Mexican city,
and that bodes well for the prospects of taking smaller steps,
said Halldor Thorgeirsson, a director at the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change, which organizes the talks.  “The obstacles to a significant outcome in Cancun remain
formidable, and the likelihood of a continued deadlock remains
significant,” Thorgeirsson said today in a speech at the
political analyst Chatham House in London. Still, “a new treaty
is by no means the only measure of success,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
