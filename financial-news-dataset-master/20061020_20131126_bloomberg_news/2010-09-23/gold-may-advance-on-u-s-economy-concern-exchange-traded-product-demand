Gold, trading near a record in
London, may climb on concerns over the strength of the U.S.
economic rebound and rising inflows into exchange-traded
products. Silver pared gains after advancing to a 30-month high.  Global holdings  of gold by ETPs rose to a record yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data from 10 providers. Reports today may
show that existing home sales in the U.S. climbed in August to
the second-lowest level on record, indicating housing remains
depressed a year after the economic recovery began, while
jobless claims held at a two-month low.  The euro declined from near a five-month high against the
dollar after growth in Europe’s services and manufacturing
industries weakened more than forecast, fueling concern the
region’s economic recovery might lose steam. The 16-nation
currency snapped a three-day run of gains against the greenback,
which was given impetus by the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 21
statement that it was willing to ease monetary policy further to
boost the world’s largest economy.  “To overcome the $1,300 mark with gold should only be a
question of time,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. Precious metals prices were
“driven by a very weak dollar after the Fed statement,” and
are being reinforced by “massive inflows into gold and silver
exchange-traded funds as well as high speculative interest.”  Bullion for immediate-delivery was little changed at
$1,291.55 an ounce at 10:28 a.m. in London. It reached a record
$1,296.30 yesterday. Gold for December delivery was 0.1 percent
higher at $1,292.80 an ounce on the Comex in New York, after
touching an all-time high $1,298 yesterday.  ETP Holdings Rise       Global holdings  of gold by ETPs gained 0.22 metric tons to
2,089.7 tons yesterday, according to Bloomberg data from 10
providers. Holdings are up 16 percent this year. Silver held
through four providers of ETPs gained 1 percent to 13,412.25
tons yesterday, the highest in at least seven months, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Both gold and silver will go up further,” Briesemann
said. The U.S. economy is “still not out of the woods,” he
added.  Bullion declined to $1,291.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,293.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Silver for immediate delivery in London eased 0.4 percent
to $21.0662 an ounce, after earlier today gaining as much as 0.3
percent to $21.2225, the highest level since March 2008. Silver
is up 25 percent this year.  Home Sales  The dollar dipped near a five-month low against the euro
earlier today before rebounding 0.5 percent. The National
Association of Realtors report, which is scheduled at 10 a.m. in
Washington, is expected to show sales of existing U.S. homes
rising to a 4.1 million annual pace in August. That is behind
only July’s 3.83 million as the weakest in a decade’s worth of
data, according to a Bloomberg survey. A Labor Department report
at 8:30 a.m. will show claims for unemployment benefits held at
450,000 last week for a second time, according to the Bloomberg
survey.  “If the data is disappointing, then it will definitely
weigh on the dollar,” Briesemann said.  Gold, up 18 percent this year, is heading for its 10th
consecutive annual gain, the longest winning streak since at
least 1920. Bullion has outperformed global equities, Treasuries
and most industrial metals. The metal rallied as central banks
and governments maintained low borrowing costs and spent
trillions of dollars to stimulate their economies.  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent and purchased mortgage-backed securities
and Treasuries to help bolster the economy.  Inflation and Gold  Policy makers said in their Sept. 21 statement they are
“prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to
support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over
time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”  Gold has gained this year even as U.S. inflation slowed.
Bullion is traditionally bought as a hedge against rising
consumer prices. Inflation expectations, based on the  10-year 
U.S. Treasury breakeven rate, have fallen to 1.89 percent from
2.21 percent six months ago.  “Inflation seems to be below target and new quantitative
measures might be imminent,” Briesemann said.  Platinum rose 0.1 percent to $1,634.25 an ounce, after
reaching $1,640.38, the highest level since May 19. Palladium
slipped 0.7 percent to $542.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
