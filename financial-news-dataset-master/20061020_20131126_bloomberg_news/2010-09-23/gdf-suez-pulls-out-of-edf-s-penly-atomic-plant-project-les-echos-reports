GDF Suez SA is ending its
involvement in Electricite de France SA’s planned atomic plant
at Penly in northern France, Les Echos reported, without saying
how it got the information.  GDF’s Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet wrote to
Prime Minister Francois Fillon to inform him of the decision,
the newspaper said. Total SA will keep its 8.3 percent stake,
Les Echos added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
