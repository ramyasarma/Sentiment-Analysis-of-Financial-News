Orange-crop acreage in Florida, the
world’s second-biggest producer, fell to a 24-year low as
growers removed trees to slow the spread of disease affecting
citrus crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.  The state has 483,418 acres of orange groves this year,
down 1.8 percent from 492,529 acres in 2009, the USDA said today
in a  report  on its Web site. That marked the smallest area since
1986 after several major freezes hurt groves.  “The citrus greening is still doing its dirty work,”  Tom Spreen , a professor at the University of Florida’s Food and
Resource Economics Department in Gainesville, said before the
report. “The greening is really, really putting a damper on
people planting new trees.”  Orange-juice futures have gained 22 percent this year on
signs of increasing global demand and forecasts for a smaller
crop in Brazil, the biggest producer.  The number of orange trees in Florida fell 1.9 percent to
63.8 million this year from 65 million in 2009, the USDA said.
Citrus greening is a bacterial disease, spread by insects, that
can kill orange trees. It was first found in Florida in 2005.  The acreage report is a “big deal because the number of
trees in the ground estimates the amount of fruit that can be
produced,” Spreen said.  Canker, Real Estate  Florida orange-grove acreage has been declining since at
least 2000 because of citrus canker, another disease, and real-
estate development.  The state’s orange production fell to a 17-year low of 129
million boxes in 2007 after storms in 2004 and 2005 damaged
groves. Florida growers picked 133.6 million boxes this season,
down 18 percent from the prior year, USDA data showed in July. A
box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  Independent forecaster  Elizabeth Steger  in August projected
Florida’s orange harvest will increase 15 percent, to 154
million boxes in the coming season.  “The number of fruit per tree is greater than last year,
but the fruit size is smaller,” Steger said in an e-mail last
week. She has been forecasting Florida’s orange crop since 1992
and her estimates are widely followed by the citrus industry.  The USDA on Oct. 8 will release its first official estimate
for the harvest, which begins next month and runs through June.  Florida’s total citrus acreage, including grapefruit and
specialty trees, fell 2.6 percent to 554,037 acres, the USDA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
