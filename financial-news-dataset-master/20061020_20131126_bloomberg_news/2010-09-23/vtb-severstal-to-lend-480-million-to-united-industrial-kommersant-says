VTB Group and OAO Severstal plan to
lend Russian lawmaker Sergei Pugachyov’s United Industrial Corp.
$480 million to repay international lenders of his bank, which
defaulted on Eurobonds this year, Kommersant said.   The six-month loan has an annual interest rate of 20
percent and is guaranteed by the license Pugachyov holds to the
Elegest coal deposit in Siberia, the Moscow-based newspaper said
today. Severstal will manage the Elegest project as part of the
deal, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
