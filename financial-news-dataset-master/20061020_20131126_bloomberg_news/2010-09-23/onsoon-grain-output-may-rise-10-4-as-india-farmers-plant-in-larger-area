India’s monsoon-sown food grain
output may rise 10.4 percent from a year earlier after farmers
planted crops such as rice and lentils in a larger area, the
farm ministry said.  Production of grains sowed at the start of the June to
September rainy season may rise to 114.63 million metric tons,
from 103.84 million tons a year earlier, the farm ministry said
in a statement issued in New Delhi today. Rice output may rise
to 80.41 million tons, from 75.91 million tons, it said.  The better harvest will not end a ban on shipments of non-
Basmati rice and wheat as the government seeks to fulfill an
election promise of ensuring food for the poor, Farm Minister
 Sharad Pawar  said in New Delhi today.  “We are not ready to take any risk on allowing export of
wheat and rice, unless some definite view is taken about food
security,” Pawar said.  Production of corn may rise to 14.06 million tons from 12
million tons a year earlier, the farm ministry said. Output of
lentils may increase to 6 million tons from 4.3 million tons, it
said.  Cotton output may rise to 33.5 million bales of 170
kilograms each from 23.9 million bales, according to the
statement.  Output of monsoon-sown oilseeds such as peanuts and
sunflower may rise to 17.3 million tons from 15.7 million tons a
year earlier, the ministry said. Soybean production may drop to
9.8 million tons from 10.05 million tons a year earlier, it said.  India’s sugar cane production may rise to 324.9 million
tons in 2010-11 from 277.7 million tons a year earlier, the farm
ministry said.  Sugar output may total 24 million tons in the year starting
Oct. 1 as farmers planted the crop in a larger area, Pawar said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
