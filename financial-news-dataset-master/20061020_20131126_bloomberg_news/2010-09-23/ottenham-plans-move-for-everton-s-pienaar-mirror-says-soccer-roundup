for Everton midfielder  Steven Pienaar , who hasn’t agreed to a
new deal with the Liverpool club,  the Daily Mirror  said. The
South African’s contract expires at the end of the season.  Everton rejected several offers from Spurs before the
season, the newspaper said.  Ferguson Shops  Manchester United coach  Alex Ferguson  missed last night’s
League Cup victory at Scunthorpe to look at Atletico Madrid
goalkeeper David de Gea, the  Mirror said.   The 19-year-old was playing at Valencia, United’s next
opponent in the Champions League, and Ferguson took the
opportunity to scout the player and the team, the newspaper
said.  Arsene’s Plans  Arsenal’s  Arsene Wenger  said he’ll continue to coach as
long as he’s healthy, according to an  interview  with L’Equipe.  The 60-year-old’s contract in London runs through 2014, and
he didn’t rule out a return to France, the newspaper said.  Fiesta Fallout  Arsenal forward Carlos Vela and Celtic midfielder Efrain
Juarez have been banned from playing on the Mexico national team
for six months for organizing a party after an exhibition match
earlier this month, the  Guardian said .  Eleven other players were fined about 2,500 pounds each
after the 1-0 victory over Colombia in Monterrey, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
