Croatia plans infrastructure
investments exceeding 15 billion kuna ($2.6 billion) to revive
its faltering economy and create more work places, Prime
Minister  Jadranka Kosor  said.  Projects being considered include thermal plants Sisak C
and Plomin 3, eight hydro-electric plants, and the new railroad
from the capital Zagreb to the country’s major port Rijeka.  Croatia, which aims to become the European Union’s 28th
member by 2012, has seen its economy shrink for six consecutive
quarters as investment and consumption faltered  and the
unemployment rate climbed to more than 16 percent.  The government has announced it will sell minority stakes
in state-owned companies, as well as sell or lease its buildable
land, in order to fill the budget gap and service a growing
external debt.  A top-heavy economy with public workers, retirees, welfare
recipients and veterans depending on the heavily strained
budget, Croatia is also under pressure to reform its
administration, eradicate corruption and improve competition
before it can join the EU.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
