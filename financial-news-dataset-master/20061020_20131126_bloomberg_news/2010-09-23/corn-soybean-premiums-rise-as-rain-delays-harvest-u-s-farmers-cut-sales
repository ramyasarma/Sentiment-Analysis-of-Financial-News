Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans increased relative
to Chicago futures as rains across parts of the Midwest this
week stalled harvesting and crop sales.  The spot-basis  bid , or premium, for corn delivered in
September was 34 cents to 35 cents a bushel above December
futures, compared with 17 cents to 35 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data showed. Soybean premiums rose to
52 cents to 57 cents above November futures from 50 cents to 56
cents yesterday.  “The rains have slowed harvesting, and farmers have not
been big sellers of either corn or soybeans this week,” said
 Bryce Stremming , a market consultant at Mid-Co Commodities LLC
in Bloomington, Illinois.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 1.1
percent, to close at $4.9925 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Aug.
24. On Sept. 20, the price reached $5.2375, the highest level
since Sept. 30, 2008.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to close at $10.935 a bushel. Earlier, the price
reached $10.9825. On Sept. 20, the oilseed climbed to $10.995,
the highest level since June 2009.  Sales of corn for delivery in the year that began Sept. 1
rose to 16.5 million metric tons as of Sept. 16, up 16 percent
from a year earlier,  USDA data  show. Soybean sales are up 4
percent to 19.5 million.  Freight Costs  Corn sales represent 31 percent of the 53.34 million tons
expected by the USDA in the year, up from 26 percent on average
for the date in the prior five years. Soybean sales are equal to
48 percent of the season’s forecast.  Today, the  cost  of moving grain along the upper Illinois
River to New Orleans rose to 545 percent of the 1976 published
tariff rates to the highest level in 10 months, the USDA said.
The rate was 484 percent a week ago and 389 percent a year
earlier, USDA data show.  “Shipping is backlogged until the first of the year,”
Stremming said. “Once harvesting is completed, basis will rise
to buy some corn and soybeans from farmers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
