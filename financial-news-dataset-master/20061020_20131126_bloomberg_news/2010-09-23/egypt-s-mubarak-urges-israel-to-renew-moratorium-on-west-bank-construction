Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak 
urged Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  to extend a
temporary moratorium on the building of settlements in the West
Bank and called on the international community to stay united
behind the peace talks.  Israel should “extend the moratorium on settlement
construction that is about to end,” Mubarak said today in Rome
after meeting Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. His
comments were translated into Italian from Arabic.  “I repeat the need for everyone to unite their efforts for
the success of the negotiations,” said Mubarak, who is in Rome
to attend the opening of an Egyptian museum.  U.S.-sponsored peace talks between the Palestinians and
Israel are nearing a critical juncture with the scheduled Sept.
26 expiration of Israel’s 10-month moratorium on settlement
construction. Netanyahu has said repeatedly he doesn’t plan to
extend the freeze. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas
has said he’ll abandon the talks, which began earlier this
month, if construction resumes.  Mubarak hosted the second round of talks in Sharm el-Sheikh
on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
