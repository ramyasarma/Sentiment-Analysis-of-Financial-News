Eni SpA plans to sell 10- and 30-
year U.S. dollar-denominated debt in a benchmark offering,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The senior unsecured notes may be sold as soon as today,
said the person, who declined to be identified because terms
aren’t set. Proceeds may be used for the repayment of existing
debt and for general corporate purposes, the person said. A
benchmark sale is typically at least $500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
