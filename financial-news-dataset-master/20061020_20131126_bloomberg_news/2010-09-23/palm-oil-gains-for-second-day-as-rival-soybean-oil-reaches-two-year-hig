Palm oil futures, which closed the
day little changed, may decline on concern that the rally to a
one-month high may cool demand from India and China, the biggest
users of the tropical commodity.  December-delivery futures ended at 2,671 ringgit a metric
ton ($861) on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange after rising as
much as 1 percent to 2,699 ringgit intraday as rival soybean oil
jumped to a two-year high and the dollar dropped. Prices closed
at 2,708 ringgit, a one-month high, on Sept. 20.  “There isn’t much demand for physical palm oil from buyers
like China and India at the current price,” said  Amol Tilak , an
analyst at Kotak Commodity Services Ltd. Futures may drop by 50
ringgit to 60 ringgit a ton before demand revives, he said.  The tropical oil has rebounded 18 percent from an eight-
month low on July 7 on speculation that demand will increase
from Asian countries celebrating festivals and that harvesting
in Malaysia and Indonesia will be disrupted in November and
December if La Nina causes flooding in growing areas.  Palm oil climbed earlier as December-delivery soybean oil
rose as much as 2 percent to 44.13 cents a pound on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the highest since Oct. 2, 2008. Soybean futures
for November delivery gained 0.9 percent to $10.9825 a bushel.
The oilseed reached a 15-month high of $10.995 on Sept. 20.  The dollar declined for a fourth day against a six-currency
basket before a report that may show existing U.S. home sales
were near the lowest in 10 years, backing the case for the
Federal Reserve to keep borrowing costs low. U.S. shippers sold
226,000 tons to China, the Department of Agriculture said
yesterday, bringing this week’s total to 621,000 tons.  Futures may rally another 3 to 4 percent before an increase
in production weighs on prices, said  Kishore Narne , head of
research at AnandRathi Commodities Ltd. said. A rally in
Malaysian ringgit has increased the cost for buyers, he said.  The ringgit has risen 10.9 percent this year, the best
performance among Asia’s 10 most-active currencies. Markets in
China, Japan and Hong Kong are closed for holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
