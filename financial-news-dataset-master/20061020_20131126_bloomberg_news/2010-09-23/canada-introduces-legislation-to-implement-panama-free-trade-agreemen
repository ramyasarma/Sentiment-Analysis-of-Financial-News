Canadian Trade Minister Peter Van
Loan introduced legislation today to implement the country’s
free-trade agreement with Panama.  The trade agreement was signed in May, and will give
Canadian companies access to the government procurement market
in the Central American country, including the expansion of the
Panama Canal, Van Loan said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
