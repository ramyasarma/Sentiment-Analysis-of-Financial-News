Most developing-nation stocks fell,
with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index retreating from a two-year
high, as more Asian central banks are expected to raise interest
rates to combat rising inflation.  The MSCI index dropped 0.1 percent to 1,047.19 as of 4:44
p.m. in Singapore, with two stocks declining for every one that
gained. India’s Sensex index dropped 0.6 percent, led by banks
and developers after a government report showed the nation’s
food inflation accelerated to a six-week high, increasing
pressure on the central bank to increase interest rates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
