Johnson Controls Inc. , which is
involved in more than 500 renewable-energy projects worldwide,
expects “exponential” growth in India’s low-carbon market as
companies plan investments to cut energy costs.  Indian companies are planning on average to spend 12
percent of their budgets on energy-efficiency investments in the
next year, Pramoda Karkal, managing director of Johnson
Controls’s India unit, said today, citing an April survey
conducted by the Milwaukee-based company.  “This is creating a market for such projects,” Karkal
said by telephone from New Delhi. “It’s likely to grow at an
absolutely exponential curve.”  Indian companies expect energy costs to rise 17 percent
this year and are prioritizing such investments more than
counterparts in nine other countries surveyed, including the
U.S., Germany and China, the poll of 311 companies found.  India plans to start a market for trading energy-efficiency
credits that is expected to grow to $16 billion in five years,
 Ajay Mathur , director-general of the Bureau of Energy
Efficiency, said in an interview on Jan. 14. The number of
energy-service companies in India, which audit consumption and
help to reduce it, has more than doubled this year to 80, the
bureau said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
