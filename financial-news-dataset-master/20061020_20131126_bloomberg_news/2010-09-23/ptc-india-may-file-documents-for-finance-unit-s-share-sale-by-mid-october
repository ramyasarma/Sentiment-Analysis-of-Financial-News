PTC India Ltd., the nation’s
largest power trader, may file share-sale documents for a unit
backed by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Macquarie Group Ltd.  by
mid-October, a company official said.  “The process is on,” PTC India Chairman  Tantra Narayan Thakur  said by telephone from New Delhi today, without giving
details. The unit,  PTC India Financial Services Ltd. , invests in
electricity generation plants and assets.  India is drawing investment to its electricity and
infrastructure companies as the third-fastest growing major
economy targets increasing generation capacity to meet demand
and reduce blackouts. Indian companies may raise about $12.3
billion from share sales by year end, lagging behind only China
in Asia, according to Citigroup Inc. estimates.  PTC  has a 77 percent stake in the unit, known also as PFS,
and plans to retain a 51 percent holding after the sale, Thakur
said in May. Goldman Sachs and Macquarie hold 11.5 percent each,
he said then.  PFS needs to raise as much as 10 billion rupees ($219
million), Thakur said at the time.  India requires an installed generation capacity of  200
gigawatts  to sustain economic growth of 8 percent, the power
ministry said on its website. The country had 165 gigawatts as
of Aug. 31, according the Central Electricity Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
