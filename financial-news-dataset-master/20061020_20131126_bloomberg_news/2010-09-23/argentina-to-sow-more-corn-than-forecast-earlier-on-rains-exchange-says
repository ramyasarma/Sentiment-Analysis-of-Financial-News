Corn farmers in Argentina, the
world’s second largest exporter, will plant more than previously
forecast this year as rains may increase yields for the next
harvest, the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said.  The crop will cover 3 million hectares (7.4 million), more
than the 2.93 million forecast a week ago, the exchange said in
its weekly  crop report  sent by e-mail today. About 13 percent of
the area has been planted, the exchange said.  The Argentine corn growers association expects a record
crop of 3.5 million to 3.8 million hectares for the 2010-2011
season, the group’s director  Martin Fraguio  said in an Aug. 31
interview. Output may reach a record of about 26 million tons,
he said. The previous record was 22 million tons in the 2007-
2008 season.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 1.1
percent, to close at $4.9925 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  The U.S. is the world’s largest corn exporter and Brazil is
the third biggest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
