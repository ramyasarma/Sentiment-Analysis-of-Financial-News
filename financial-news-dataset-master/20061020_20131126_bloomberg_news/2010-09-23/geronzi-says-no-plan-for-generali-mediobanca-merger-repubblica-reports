Assicurazioni Generali SpA Chairman
Cesare Geronzi doesn’t plan a merger with the insurer’s biggest
shareholder Mediobanca SpA, the executive told la Repubblica in
an interview.  Geronzi also said he didn’t act to oust Alessandro Profumo
from UniCredit SpA and that what happened in the last few days
at UniCredit created “great damage to Italy” and gave the
“international markets a poor demonstration of what is the
Italian financial system,” the Italian daily reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
