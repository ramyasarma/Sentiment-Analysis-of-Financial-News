Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  wants the Treasury’s Director General  Vittorio Grilli 
to succeed  Alessandro Profumo  as chief executive officer of
 UniCredit SpA ,  Milano Finanza  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  UniCredit Chairman  Dieter Rampl  prefers that an internal
candidate take over as CEO, the newspaper also said today.
Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Roberto Nicastro  is a leading
contender for the job, MF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
