Apollo Global Management  and CVC
Capital Partners Ltd. extended their offer to buy Brit Insurance
Holdings NV to Jan. 10 after receiving acceptances from 71
percent of shareholders.  Achilles Netherlands Holdings BV, the unit set up by the
private equity firms to purchase Brit, had agreed to buy 56
million Brit shares as of 1 p.m. yesterday, the closing date of
the original offer, the company said in a statement today.  Apollo and CVC agreed to buy Brit for as much as 888
million pounds ($1.4 billion) on Oct. 26, ending four months of
takeover negotiations. Lloyd’s of London insurers have become
cheaper takeover targets after premiums fell because of more
competition caused by an abundance of capital built up after two
years of relatively few natural catastrophes.  The bid for Brit, part of which is dependent on the size of
the company’s assets at the end of the year, values the insurer
at as much as 51 percent more than its closing price of 729
pence on June 10, the day before the first offer was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
