Soybean futures fell for the first
time in eight sessions as demand eased after a rally to a 28-
month high. Corn rose, extending the longest rally since 2008.  Before today, soybeans climbed 12 percent this month and
corn advanced 15 percent as hot, dry weather in threatened crops
in Argentina, a leading producer and exporter. Rains early next
month may revive oilseeds before plants begin to set pods and
fill them with beans.  “Everybody is expecting to see some of these demand
numbers shrink, but we haven’t seen it yet,” said  Dax Wedemeyer , a broker at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines,
Iowa. “We’ve had quite a run in all these markets.”  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 10 cents, or 0.7
percent, to close at $13.77 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Yesterday, the price reached $13.9675, the
highest for the most-active contract since August 2008.  Some parts of central and northern growing regions in
Argentina got as much as 1.9 inches (4.8 centimeters) of rain in
the past week, and more precipitation next week will reduce
stress on some fields in southern areas, said  Don Keeney , a
senior agricultural meteorologist for MDA Information Systems
Inc. in Rockville, Maryland.  “Rains next week may be too late for corn,” said  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president for the Linn Group in
Chicago. “Today’s selling is all about profit-taking ahead of
the year-end.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $6.24 a bushel. The grain climbed for the ninth
straight session, the longest rally since April 2008. Earlier,
the price reached $6.265, the highest since August 2008.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
