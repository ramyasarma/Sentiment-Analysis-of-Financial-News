Oil declined from near a 26-month
high in New York on speculation the economic recovery in the
U.S. isn’t fast enough to reduce excess fuel supplies in the
world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures slipped as much as 0.8 percent after a report
yesterday showed an unexpected decline in U.S. consumer
confidence. The Energy Department may say tomorrow that gasoline
stockpiles increased for a fourth week.  “Inventories are still high,” said  Thorbjoern Bak Jensen ,
an analyst at Global  Risk Mangement  in Middelfart, Denmark.
“Consumer confidence was worse than expected yesterday, with
low confidence in the present situation.”  Crude for February delivery fell as much as 69 cents to
$90.80 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $91 at 1:28 p.m. London time. The contract
traded at $91.88 on Dec. 27, the highest level since Oct. 7,
2008. Brent crude for February settlement fell 53 cents to
$93.85 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Government data published yesterday showed a decline in
U.S. consumer confidence and a bigger-than-projected drop in
home values. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of U.S. property values
fell 0.8 percent in October from a year earlier, the group said
yesterday, and the New York-based Conference Board’s confidence
index dropped to 52.5, lower than the most pessimistic forecast
of 61 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Consumers Anxious  “Consumers are clearly still anxious about the future,”
said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an energy
adviser in New Canaan, Connecticut. “Expectations had been for
an improvement to 56, so the figure was not helpful.”  The Energy Department may say  gasoline stockpiles  rose by
1.63 million barrels last week from 217.2 million, according to
a Bloomberg News survey. Crude supplies  probably dropped  2.85
million barrels from 340.7 million, while distillate fuel
inventories, including heating oil and diesel, probably fell
875,000 barrels from 160.7 million, the survey showed.  The Energy Department will release its weekly report at 11
a.m. tomorrow in Washington, a day later than usual because of
Christmas. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute,
which collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis, will
issue its report today, also a day later than usual.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump jumped 4.6 percent last
week, according to  MasterCard Inc.  Motorists bought an average
9.613 million barrels a day of gasoline in the week ended Dec.
24, up from 9.19 million barrels a day in the previous week,
 MasterCard Inc.  said in its weekly SpendingPulse report.  Oil, which rallied 78 percent in 2009, has advanced 15
percent this year as a decline in supplies bolstered speculation
fuel demand is recovering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
