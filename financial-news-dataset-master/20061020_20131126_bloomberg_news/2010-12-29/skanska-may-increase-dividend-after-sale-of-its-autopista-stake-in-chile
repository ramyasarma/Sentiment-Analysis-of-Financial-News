Skanska AB, the Nordic region’s
largest construction company, may distribute the cash it
generated from the sale of its 50 percent stake in joint venture
PPP Highway Autopista Central in Santiago, Chile, to
shareholders, spokesman Peter Gimbe said by phone today.  “This opens up the possibility of a higher dividend to the
shareholders,” Gimbe, who is based in Stockholm, said. “But
that will be up to the board to decide next year.”  Skanska said today it sold its share in PPP Highway
Autopista Central for 6 billion kronor ($877 million) to Alberta
Investment Management Corporation of Canada. The Stockholm-based
company will make a capital gain after tax of 5 billion kronor
from the sale, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
