The executors of  Michael Jackson ’s
estate asked  Discovery Communications Inc.  Chief Executive
Officer  David Zaslav  to cancel a televised re-enactment of the
pop star’s autopsy.  A Discovery channel in Europe plans to air “Michael
Jackson’s Autopsy: What Really Killed Michael Jackson” next
month, executors  John Branca  and  John McClain  said in a letter
released today.  “Your decision to even schedule this program is in
shockingly bad taste, insensitive to Michael’s family, and
appears motivated solely by your blind desire to exploit
Michael’s death,” the executors said in the letter.  Michelle Russo , a Discovery spokeswoman, said the company
had no comment. The show is set to air in the U.K. on Jan. 13,
CNN reported Dec. 14, citing the network.  Jackson, 50, died in 2009, leaving about $500 million in
debt. Since his death, the estate, the owner of interests in
songs by the Beatles and other artists, has generated about $275
million.  A posthumous album, “Michael,” was released on Dec. 14 by
 Sony Corp.   Discovery, based in Silver Spring, Maryland, gained 40
cents to $42.20 in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The Class A
shares have climbed 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
