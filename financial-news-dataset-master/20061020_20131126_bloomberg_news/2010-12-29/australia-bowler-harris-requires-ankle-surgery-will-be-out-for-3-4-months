Australia fast bowler Ryan Harris
will undergo ankle surgery today that will rule him out of
action for as many as four months, Cricket Australia said.  Harris, 31, broke down during his run-up midway through day
three of the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne yesterday and scans
later revealed a stress fracture of his left ankle. He was
reviewed today by a specialist, who recommended the surgery.  “This surgery will occur today and we expect Ryan’s
recovery time to be 3-4 months,” Cricket Australia Doctor
Trefor James said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
