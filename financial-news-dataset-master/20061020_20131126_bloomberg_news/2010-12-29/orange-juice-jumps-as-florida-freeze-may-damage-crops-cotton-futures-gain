Orange-juice gained for the eighth
time in nine sessions on speculation that an overnight frost
damaged crops in Florida, the second-largest producer. Cotton
fell for a fifth day.  Sub-freezing temperatures may have caused “spotty
damages” to groves in southwestern Florida, according to Kyle
Tapley, a meteorologist at Rockville, Maryland-based MDA
EarthSat Weather. Prices have risen 27 percent this year partly
as adverse weather threatened crops in the U.S. and Brazil, the
largest grower.  “The market reacts every time there is some talk of
frost,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures
Group Inc. in Chicago, said.  Orange juice for March delivery gained 2.05 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1.638 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York.  Prices surged to a three-year high of $1.706 on Dec. 13
after Florida declared a state of emergency amid severe cold and
prospects of crop damage.  The state will produce 143 million boxes of oranges in the
harvest that began in October and runs into July, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said on Dec. 10. That’s down from an
October estimate of 146 million boxes.  In the previous season, output dropped to 133.6 million
boxes, the second-smallest crop in two decades, after a January
freeze damaged fruit. A box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  Cotton futures for March delivery declined 3.92 cents, or
2.7 percent, to $1.4043 a pound on ICE. The price has declined
for five straight sessions, the longest string of declines since
early June, dropping 12 percent. The commodity has surged 86
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
