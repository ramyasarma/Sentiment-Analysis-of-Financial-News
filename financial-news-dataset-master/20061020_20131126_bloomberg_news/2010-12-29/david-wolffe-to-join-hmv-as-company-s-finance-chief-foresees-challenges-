HMV Group Plc , the U.K. music and
DVD retailer that owns Waterstone’s bookstores, appointed David Wolffe  as group finance director as it moves into live music to
boost sales.  Wolffe will join the company, based at Maidenhead, west of
London, on Jan. 10, according to a statement distributed by the
Regulatory News Service today. He arrives from broadcaster  ITV
Plc , where he was a finance director. Wolffe has also worked for
AOL Europe and the British Broadcasting Corp.  HMV’s markets are “not without their challenges,” Wolffe
said in the statement. The retailer is adding loyalty cards and
diversifying into live music venues and festivals to increase
revenue as competition from supermarkets and online retailers
sharpens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
