ITE Technology Inc. shares rose to
its highest in a year in Taipei trading after the Liberty Times
reported HTC Corp. may acquire the company.  The stock jumped 5.3 percent to NT$67.1 at 9:09 a.m. local
time, set for the highest since Jan. 21. HTC lost 0.5 percent to
NT$889.  HTC, the world’s largest maker of handsets using Google
Inc. and Microsoft corp. operating systems, may acquire the
Hsinchu, Taiwan-based ITE for supply of semiconductors used in
touch screens, the Chinese-language daily reported, without
saying where it got the information.  ITE spokesman Stanley Wang denied the report. “The report
was groundless, we aren’t in talks with HTC or anyone else on
selling the company,” Wang said by phone today. HTC chief
financial officer Cheng Hui-ming didn’t immediately answer calls
made to his mobile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
