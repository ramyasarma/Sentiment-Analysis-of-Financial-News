Tower Australia Group Ltd.  shares
jumped the most on record after  Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. 
agreed to take over the insurer.  Tower shares jumped 42 percent to A$3.87 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney trading, the biggest gain since the insurer was
spun out of its former New Zealand parent Tower Ltd. in November
2006. Dai-ichi Life, Japan’s second-biggest life insurer which
already owned 29 percent of Tower Australia, said yesterday it
will pay A$1.2 billion ($1.2 billion) to buy the remainder in
its biggest overseas acquisition.  Tower Australia’s independent directors unanimously
recommend shareholders vote in favor of Dai-ichi Life
Insurance’s takeover offer in the absence of a superior proposal,
according to a statement from the Sydney-based company today.
Dai-ichi Life’s offer of A$4 a share was 46.5 percent more than
 Tower Australia ’s share price before the announcement.  “The Independent Directors believe that this offer
represents a compelling premium and a highly attractive outcome
for our shareholders,” Tower Chairman  Rob Thomas  said.  Before the offer, Tower was trading at 1.3 times its  book
value , the second lowest among six Australian insurers  tracked 
by Bloomberg. Dai-ichi’s offer values the stock at 1.95 times,
higher than the 1.8 multiple for the six companies, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tokyo-based Dai-ichi, established in 1902, purchased about
30 percent of Tower Australia from Guinness Peat Group Plc for
37.6 billion yen ($456 million) in 2008. The Japanese company
also has operations in Vietnam, India and Thailand.  Japan’s life insurers are struggling for new customers
after the first global recession since World War II. One in five
 Japanese citizens  is over 65 years old. Only 13 percent are
under 15, according to government statistics.  The transaction is expected to close in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
