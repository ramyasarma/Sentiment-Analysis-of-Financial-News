Liberia is expecting about 100,000
refugees from Ivory Coast because of the political situation in
the neighboring country, Liberia’s Internal Affairs Minister
Harrison Kanwea said.  More than 16,000 refugees crossed the border since
November, Kanwea told reporters today in the capital, Monrovia.  “The government of Liberia has decided that there will be
refugee camps established in Liberia for Ivorian refugees,” he
said. The refugees will only be integrated into local
communities where international aid groups offer support, Kanwea
said.  Laurent Gbagbo  has refused to relinquish power in Ivory
Coast to  Alassane Ouattara , who is regarded by the United
Nations, the African Union, the U.S. and France as the winner of
a Nov. 28 presidential election. The Economic Community of West
African States on Dec. 24 said it would consider using
“legitimate force” to remove Gbagbo if he continues to ignore
international calls to quit.  More than 170 people have been killed in political violence
since the election, according to the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
