Uganda’s foreign direct investment
may rise 20 percent in 2011 on higher inflows into the
petroleum, mining and agricultural industries, the  Uganda
Investment Authority  said.  Investment may increase to $1.2 billion from the estimated
$1 billion this year, Maggie Kigozi, the agency’s executive
director, said today in an interview in the capital, Kampala.  “Interest in petroleum is huge” and that is pulling in
investment in other areas, she said. Some investors may wait
until after elections in February, Kigozi said.  Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest economy, is to hold
presidential and parliamentary elections on Feb. 18. President
 Yoweri Museveni , who has ruled the country since 1986, is being
challenged by seven candidates.  Most of the 550 mining companies licensed in the last three
years are about to start operations and this should bring in
investments, Kigozi said. “Agriculture is another exciting
sector, with interests in agro-processing from India and
China,” she said.  Total investment by both foreigners and Ugandans may rise
to $3 billion next year from $2 billion in 2010, Kigozi said.  Uganda, with a population of 32 million, will become a
crude producer when  Tullow Oil Plc  starts production at its
Kasamene field next year. The country has an estimated 2.5
billion barrels of oil, with 1 billion barrels already
discovered, according to Tullow. Uganda attracted $799 million
in direct investment in 2009, Kigozi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
