U.K. first-time buyers’ ability to
afford a  mortgage  improved this year to the highest since 1998
after house prices weakened and home loans became cheaper,
Halifax said.  The proportion of disposable income needed for mortgage
payments by individuals buying homes for the first time was 27
percent, the lowest in 12 years, the division of Lloyds Banking
Group said in a statement today. That compares with a peak of 50
percent in September 2007.  “Whilst the tightening in lending criteria experienced
across the mortgage industry since the onset of the credit
crunch in 2007 deterred first-buyers from trying to secure
mortgage finance, there are now encouraging signs of a modest
improvement in mortgage availability,”  Martin Ellis , an
economist at Halifax, said in the statement.  House prices fell 1.6 percent in 2010 and may decline a
further 2 percent next year, Hometrack Ltd. said on Dec. 27.
Weakening  consumer confidence  and the prospect of 330,000
public-sector job cuts have weighed on the outlook for the
property market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
