Kenya’s shilling pared earlier
losses to the dollar as investors maintained demand for the East
African nation’s currency to service the tourism industry.  The currency of the region’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.5 percent to 81.01 shilling before trading at 80.65 as
of 1:56 p.m. in Nairobi from a close of 80.62 yesterday.  “Businesses in the tourism sector are active in the market
due the festive season, with demand for the local currency high
to cover expenses,” Steve Lagat, a dealer at CFC Stanbic Bank
Ltd., said in a telephone interview from Nairobi today.  Tourism accounts for 11 percent of gross domestic product
in Kenya, and is the second-biggest foreign-exchange earner
after horticulture.  The central bank said it planned to buy 5 million pounds
($7.7 million) in the domestic foreign-exchange market today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
