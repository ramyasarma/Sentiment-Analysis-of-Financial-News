The U.S. Navy plans to award
multibillion-dollar contracts today for construction of as many
as 10 Littoral Combat Ships to each of two teams led by  Lockheed
Martin Corp.  and  Austal Ltd. , said three industry officials
familiar with the matter.  Congress approved the Navy’s plans last week to buy ships
from each of the two teams under a dual-design approach, rather
than choosing just one supplier as announced in September. The
bids submitted averaged $440 million per ship, including
construction and potential changes, Navy officials told the
Senate Armed Services Committee in Dec. 14 testimony.  Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Maryland, and Marinette Marine
Corp. of Marinette, Wisconsin, are working together on one
model, while the other is being developed by Mobile, Alabama-
based U.S. subsidiary of Australia’s Austal Ltd. and  General
Dynamics Corp.  General Dynamics is providing combat systems
designed at its Pittsfield, Massachusetts, facility for the
Austal vessel.  The awards will be disclosed by the Pentagon after 5 p.m.
Washington time, said the officials, who requested anonymity
because the formal announcement hasn’t yet been made. Captain
Cate Mueller, a Navy spokeswoman, declined to comment on the
timing.  Littoral Combat Ships are designed to operate closer to
coastlines than existing surface vessels, such as destroyers, in
missions such as clearing mines, hunting submarines and
providing humanitarian relief. The Navy projects buying 55 ships
under the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
