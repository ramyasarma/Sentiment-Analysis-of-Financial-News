MTR Corp. , Hong Kong’s subway
operator and a property owner, said Chief Executive Officer  Chow Chung Kong  will retire in December 2011 when his contract
expires.  MTR will begin a worldwide search to replace Chow, 60, who
became CEO in December 2003, the company said in a statement to
Hong Kong’s stock exchange today.  Since Chow took over, MTR’s  shares  have risen more than 170
percent, compared with an 84 percent increase in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index . During his tenure, the company has merged with
another railway operator in the city and also started
constructions of a HK$66.9 billion ($8.6 billion) train line
that will connect Hong Kong to mainland China’s planned 16,000-
kilometer (10,000 mile) high speed rail network.  MTR has also expanded outside Hong Kong to run metro lines
in Beijing and Shenzhen, with other rail franchise operations in
Melbourne, London and Stockholm.  MTR, 76 percent-owned by the Hong Kong government and one
of the biggest owners of undeveloped residential sites in the
city, has seen its earnings boosted by real estate prices, which
have risen more than 50 percent since the beginning of 2009.  The company sells land to developers for a cut of their
profits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
