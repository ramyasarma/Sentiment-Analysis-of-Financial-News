Sales of new homes in Hong Kong
dropped to the lowest level in 27 months in November, the South
China Morning Post reported, citing property agent Hong Kong
Properties.  The sale of just 27 properties can be attributed to
government cooling measures designed to drive out speculators,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
