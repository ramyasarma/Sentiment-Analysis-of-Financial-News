A suspicious package found at the
 U.S. embassy  to the Vatican turned out to be a false alarm, the
latest bomb scare after parcel explosions in Rome injured two
people Dec. 23.  Bomb experts who rushed to the scene determined that the
parcel contained ordinary stationery supplies, a spokesman for
Italy’s  Carabinieri  police said by phone. The embassy, located
on Rome’s Aventine hill, was not evacuated, said the spokesman,
who asked not to be identified because of internal policies.  Police on Dec. 27 defused a package bomb at the Greek
embassy in Rome, four days after two people were injured when
similar explosives blew up at the diplomatic missions of Chile
and Switzerland in the Italian capital. There have also been
several suspicious packages that turned out to be false alarms
at other embassies in Rome, including Finland’s mission to the
Holy See on Dec. 27.  The attacks on the Swiss and Chilean embassies probably
were carried out by anarchists, Deputy Interior Minister  Alfredo Mantovano  told Milan newspaper Il Giornale in an interview
published on Dec. 24, adding that there are several hundred
anarchists in Italy.  A spate of parcel bombs in November in Athens prompted a
48-hour suspension of international mail deliveries in Greece.
Devices exploded at the Swiss and Russian embassies in Athens.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Lorenzo Totaro  in Rome
