The potential share of London Metal
Exchange copper stockpiles held by one unidentified company fell
to 80 percent to 89 percent, from at least 90 percent.  The holding covers inventory already owned and contracts
expiring in the next two trading days, according to the Dec. 23
data, released today. The figures are used by the LME to apply
guidelines that oblige the owner to lend metal at fixed rates.  One party actually owned 50 percent to 79 percent of the
stockpiles, not counting open futures positions, as of Dec. 23,
according to the exchange. A dominant position holder, to whom
the lending guidelines are applied, is anyone owning at least 50
percent of LME registered stockpiles. There has been a dominant
owner in copper since Nov. 24.  Copper’s cash contract, for delivery in two trading days,
was trading at a $50  premium  to the benchmark three-month
contract by 12:23 p.m. in London. That futures market structure,
known as backwardation, is an indication of concern about near-
term supply.  The premium is attracting additional supply to warehouses,
with inventory rising for an 11th consecutive session today, LME
data show. That’s the longest streak since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
