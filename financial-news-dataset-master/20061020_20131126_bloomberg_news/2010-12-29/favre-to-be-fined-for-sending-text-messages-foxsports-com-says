Commissioner  Roger Goodell  is
expected to fine Minnesota Vikings quarterback  Brett Favre  for
sending suggestive text messages in 2008 to a female New York
Jets employee, without suspending the three-time National
Football League most valuable player,  FoxSports.com reported .  Goodell is expected to announce a decision in the league’s
review of the situation today or tomorrow, the website said
without citing a source for its information.  NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  didn’t immediately return an
e-mail seeking comment.  The case involves Favre and Jenn Sterger, who was a
sideline television hostess for the Jets when the quarterback
played for the team in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
