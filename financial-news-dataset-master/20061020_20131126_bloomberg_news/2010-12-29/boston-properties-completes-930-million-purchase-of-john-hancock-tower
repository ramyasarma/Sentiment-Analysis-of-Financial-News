Boston Properties Inc.  completed its
$930 million acquisition of Boston’s John Hancock Tower, New
England’s tallest building, as the biggest U.S. office real
estate investment trust expands in its home market.  The REIT paid $289.5 million in cash and took over about
$640.5 million in debt, according to a statement from the
company today. It expects to record about $3 million in costs,
with about $1 million to be expensed in the current quarter.  High-quality office towers in attractive markets are luring
investors after the 2008 credit crash froze lending and sent
values tumbling. Prices for eastern U.S. office buildings gained
22 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, Moody’s
Investors Service said last week. A gauge of overall commercial
property values rose less than 1 percent in the same period.  Boston Properties Chief Executive Officer  Mortimer Zuckerman  said in October that the 790-foot Hancock Tower was
“right in our sweet spot.” The company focuses on owning high-
end assets in the center of the most expensive markets, which
tend to attract renters looking to move up in slower economies,
he said. The  Boston -based REIT also owns the Prudential Center
and 888 Boylston St. in the city’s Back Bay neighborhood.  The Hancock tower’s seller was a joint venture between
affiliates of Normandy Real Estate Partners and Five Mile
Capital Partners LLC. The partnership bought the building at
auction for $661 million, about half of what previous owners
Broadway Partners paid for it in 2006.  Boston Properties rose 12 cents to $86.51 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has  gained 
29 percent this year, exceeding the 16 percent advance in the
17-member  Bloomberg REIT Office Property Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
