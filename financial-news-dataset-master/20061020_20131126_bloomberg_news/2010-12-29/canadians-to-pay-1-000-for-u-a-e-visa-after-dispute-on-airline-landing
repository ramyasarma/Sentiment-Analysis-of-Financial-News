The United Arab Emirates will
require Canadian visitors to buy a visa for the first time to
enter the country, paying as much as C$1000 ($1000) when
applying from Jan. 2.  The move is the latest in a dispute over airline landing 
rights between the two countries.  Canadians must apply for a visa 15 days prior to departure,
reversing the current regulation allowing them to enter the oil-
rich country without a prior visa and at no cost.  A short-term 30-day visa will cost C$250 and a three-month
visa will cost C$500, the U.A.E. Embassy in Ottawa said on its
 website . A multiple-entry visa will cost C$1000 and is valid for
six months for a maximum stay of 14-days per visit.  The U.A.E. embassy announced in November it will require
Canadians to apply for visas after an aviation dispute between
the two countries over landing rights for commercial flights.  U.A.E. carriers, including Emirates, have been seeking
dozens of new landing slots in Canada, contending that the six
weekly flights currently allowed are not enough to meet demand.
 Transport Canada , the government agency that oversees the
airline industry, and Air Canada opposed granting more slots on
concerns that U.A.E. carriers may eat into Air Canada’s traffic
to cities such as Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
