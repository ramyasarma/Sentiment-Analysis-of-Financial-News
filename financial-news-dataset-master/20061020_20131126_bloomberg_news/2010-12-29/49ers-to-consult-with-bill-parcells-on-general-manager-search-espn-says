The San Francisco 49ers will talk
with former New York Giants coach and Miami Dolphins consultant
 Bill Parcells  for his opinion on the team’s search for a coach
and general manager,  ESPN reports .  Jed York , the 49ers’ president, will contact Parcells this
week to talk about both the direction of the franchise and Vice
President of Player Personnel Trent Baalke,  ESPN said , citing an
unidentified person in National Football League.  Baalke was hired by Parcells when he was with the New York
Jets and has run the 49ers’ football operations since  Scot McCloughan  left the team in March. York said his plan to turn
the five-time Super Bowl-champion 49ers back into a playoff team
starts with hiring a new general manager.  The 49ers will miss the postseason for the eighth straight
year, and York fired coach  Mike Singletary  after last week’s
loss to St. Louis. The team yesterday interviewed Tony Softli, a
former personnel executive for the Rams and Carolina Panthers,
as its first GM candidate, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
