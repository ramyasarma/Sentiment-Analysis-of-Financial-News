Canadian stocks  rose, extending a
sixth straight monthly gain, as commodity and materials
producers gained on speculation global economic growth will
accelerate next year.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, gained 2
percent and Silver Wheaton Corp. advanced 3.8 percent. Potash
Corp., the biggest fertilizer producer by market value, climbed
4.5 percent.  Research In Motion Ltd.  fell 1.2 percent after an
analyst said it may have to re-engineer its BlackBerry PlayBook
tablet computer to improve battery life.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  increased 66.01

in the first trading session since Dec. 24. It has gained 3.8
percent since Nov. 30 and 19 percent since June 30.  “We will drift higher as sentiment improves around the
world,” said  Greg Eckel , a money manager at Morgan Meighen &
Associates Ltd. in Toronto, which oversees about C$900 million
($900 million). “We are setting ourselves up for a good near-
term scenario if China gets its economic growth under control,
and the U.S. economy is shaking off its doldrums.”  The stock index has rallied 15 percent in 2010, outgaining

year. The S&P/TSX is posting its biggest December advance since

Ireland and Spain. Bullion priced in euros and British pounds
climbed to all-time highs today.  Silver Wheaton climbed 3.8 percent to C$38.63.  Reports from the U.S. tomorrow may provide more evidence
about the strength of the economic recovery. The Institute for
Supply Management-Chicago Inc. may report that businesses in the
U.S. expanded in December for a 15th consecutive month, while
pending sales of previously owned homes probably rose 2 percent
in November from the prior month, according to Bloomberg surveys
of economists.  Potash rallied 4.5 percent C$152.56 as materials producers

the  S&P/TSX Composite Index . Agrium Inc., the fertilizer maker
based in Calgary, surged 4.3 percent to C$90.22.  Research In Motion fell 1.2 percent to C$58.15. Developers
