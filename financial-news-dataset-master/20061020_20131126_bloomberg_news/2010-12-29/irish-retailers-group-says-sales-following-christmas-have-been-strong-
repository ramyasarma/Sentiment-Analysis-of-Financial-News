Retail Ireland, a lobby group for
Irish retailers, said while post-Christmas sales have been
“strong” only three percent of survey respondents are more
confident about their business than three months ago.  “The strong post Christmas sales are some badly needed
good news after the 10 percent fall in last week’s retail sales
by comparison with the same week last year,” said Torlach
Denihan, director of Retail Ireland, which represents about
3,000 stores, in an e-mailed statement.  Sixty six percent of Irish retailers, polled by Retail
Ireland, said the prospects for business in the three months
from December to February are poor or very poor. The poll of 159
retailers was conducted prior to Ireland’s budget on Dec. 7 and
snowfalls, according to the statement.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
