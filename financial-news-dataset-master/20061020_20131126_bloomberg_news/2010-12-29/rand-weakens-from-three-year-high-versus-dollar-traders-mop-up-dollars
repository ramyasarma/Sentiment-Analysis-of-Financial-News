South Africa’s rand weakened the
most in eight trading days versus the dollar on speculation its
advance to a three-year high yesterday was encouraging some
investors to purchase foreign currency at cheaper levels.  The rand declined as much as 0.6 percent to 6.6981 per
dollar, its steepest intraday slide since Dec. 17. The currency
traded little changed at 6.6599 by 4:16 p.m. in Johannesburg,
from a previous close of 6.6602.  “A few speculative traders here and there are probably
trying to mop up some dollars at slightly cheaper levels,”
 George Glynos , managing director of  Econometrix Treasury
Management , a Johannesburg-based bond and foreign-exchange
company, said in a telephone interview. “In such thinned-out
holiday-period trading a few speculative orders can have an
impact on the market.”  The rand rallied to its strongest level since December 2007
yesterday as rising precious metals prices and South Africa’s
higher interest rates compared with developed markets lured
investors. The currency has surged 41 percent since the start of
last year as near-zero interest rates in developed countries
encouraged investors to place their money in higher-yielding
emerging markets, a strategy known as the carry trade.  Central bank rates as low as 0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25
percent in the U.S. compare with deposit returns of  5.5 percent 
in South Africa, even after nine reductions since December 2008.  Government bonds were little changed, with the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 steady at 123.81 rand.
The yield was little changed at 7.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
