Simon Property Group Inc. , the
largest U.S. mall owner, got a 3 billion-pound ($4.6 billion)
loan that will help the company bid for  Capital Shopping Centres
Group Plc .  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Morgan Stanley led a group of banks that agreed to provide
the loan, Indianapolis-based Simon said today in a statement.
The agreement will be completed next week.  The loan “would enable Simon to satisfy in full
acceptances due under a firm offer for CSC,” Simon said. The
company’s own board has given its approval to make a bid for the
London-based landlord.  The U.K. Takeover Panel gave Simon until Jan. 12 to
announce a “firm intention” to make an offer for Capital
Shopping. Simon made a conditional offer of 425 pence a share on
Dec. 15, valuing the U.K. company at 2.9 billion pounds. The bid
depends on Capital Shopping abandoning a 1.6 billion-pound
purchase of the Trafford Centre in Manchester that would give
Peel Group, the seller, as much as 25 percent of Capital
Shopping.  Capital Shopping, which delayed a shareholder vote on the
Peel transaction by more than a month to Jan. 26, has refused to
allow Simon access to its books, saying the offer “very
substantially undervalues the company and its prospects.”  CSC  declined by half a penny to 419.5 pence in London
trading, valuing the company at 2.9 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
