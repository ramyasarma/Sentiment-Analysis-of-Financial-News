German government bonds fell as
rising stock markets reduced demand for the safest assets.  The declines sent the  yield  on the 10-year bund, Europe’s
benchmark government security, to more than 3 percent for the
second time in three days as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.2
percent, climbing for the second consecutive day. Italy sells
8.5 billion euros ($11.2 billion) of 178-day Treasury bills and
5.5 billion euros of zero-coupon securities due 2012.  “We see some headwinds for bunds as riskier assets are
stable to higher, which undermines demand” for fixed-income,
said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG
in London.  The 10-year bund yield climbed three basis points to 3.03
percent as of 8:18 a.m. in London. It reached 3.08 percent on
Dec. 16, the highest since April 29, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The 2.5 percent security due January 2021 fell
0.27, or 2.7 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 95.52. Two-
year note yields slipped one basis point to 0.87 percent.  Italian 10-year yields climbed five basis points to 4.80
percent, rising for the third straight day. Spanish 10-year
bonds rose, snapping a two-day drop, with the yield two basis
points lower at 5.51 percent. Irish 10-year yields were two
basis points lower at 9.26 percent, while equivalent Greek
yields were 10 basis points higher at 12.54 percent.  Bunds have returned 6.2 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries gained 5 percent,
the indexes show. Spanish debt has lost 4.4 percent, Italian
securities have slipped 0.2 percent, while Greek bonds have
tumbled 20 percent. Irish debt has lost 14 percent in the
period, according to the EFFAS indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
