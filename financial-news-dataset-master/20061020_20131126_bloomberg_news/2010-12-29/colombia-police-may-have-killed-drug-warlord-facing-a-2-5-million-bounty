Colombian police killed a drug
trafficker responsible for more than 3,000 deaths and for whose
capture authorities were offering a reward of up to $2.5
million, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said.  Pedro Guerrero, better known by his alias Cuchillo, Spanish
for knife, was killed Dec. 25 in a gun battle with police in
central Meta province after intelligence provided information on
his whereabouts, Santos said today. The reward will be paid to
several informants, Santos said.  “He did so much damage to this country and that’s why this
hit is so important,” Santos said during a press conference
broadcast on  Caracol  Television. “The murderer of murderers is
dead.”  The former paramilitary warlord’s body was  formally 
identified at 2:30 a.m. New York time, Santos said. Police also
arrested Harold Humberto Rojas, the  second-in-command  of
Guerrero’s so-called Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army
of Colombia.  Colombia’s police this year captured 2,653 members of
criminal gangs that emerged after more than 30,000 paramilitary
fighters and their leaders laid down their weapons in peace
deals struck with the government between 2003 and 2006.
Hundreds, like Guerrero, later returned to crime and went into
hiding.  Of those arrested this year, 301 are demobilized fighters
entitled to government retraining and reduced prison sentences
in exchange for confessing their crimes and human rights abuses,
according to the police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
