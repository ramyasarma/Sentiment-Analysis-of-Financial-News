The Canadian dollar exceeded parity
with its U.S. counterpart for a second day as commodities
including crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, changed hands at
almost the highest levels since at least 2008.  An advance by the currency, known as the loonie, was
limited as a drop in U.S. consumer confidence spurred bets the
recovery in the world’s largest economy and Canada’s biggest
trading partner may be protracted. The greenback fell against
all of its 16 most-traded counterparts. Canada’s dollar headed
for a monthly gain versus most peers.  “The Canadian dollar is pretty strong, sitting right at
parity and supported by copper at record highs and oil above
$90,”  Camilla Sutton , chief currency strategist in Toronto at
Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit, said via e-mail.  Canada’s currency traded at C$1.0009 per U.S. dollar at 5
p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0010 yesterday, when it
traded on a one-for-one basis with the greenback for the first
time in seven weeks. It appreciated today as much as 0.4 percent
to 99.75 Canadian cents, the strongest since April 26, and
weakened as much as 0.5 percent.  Canadian  house prices  decreased 0.4 percent in October, the
second straight monthly drop, the Teranet-National Bank
Composite House Price Index showed. Prices fell 1.1 percent in
September, ending 16 straight gains, according to a report
released today by National Bank Financial. The decline reported
today matched the prediction in a Bloomberg News survey.  Major Peers  Canada’s currency fell against 15 of its 16 major peers
today, sliding the most against New Zealand’s dollar while
appreciating versus the greenback. The loonie has risen this
month against most counterparts, strengthening 2.6 percent
against the U.S. dollar. It has gained the most versus the
pound, advancing 3 percent, and fallen the most against South
Africa’s rand, losing 4 percent.  For the year, the Canadian dollar, nicknamed the loonie for
the image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, strengthened
against half of its major counterparts. It advanced the most
against the Danish krone, 14 percent, and fell the most versus
the yen, 7.6 percent.  Canada’s government bonds have returned 6 percent in 2010,
after losing 1.5 percent last year, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index. The securities gained 12 percent in
2008. Global sovereign bonds are up 3.4 percent this year,
according to a separate Merrill Lynch index.  Canadian corporate debt has returned 7.1 percent this year,
and provincial bonds have gained 7 percent.  Bonds Erase Losses  Government bonds erased losses today. The  two-year note 
yield was little changed at 1.69 percent, after earlier
increasing seven basis points to 1.77 percent, the highest level
since July 9. The 1.5 percent security due in December 2012 rose
one cents to C$99.65. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Crude oil for February delivery traded at $91 a barrel in
New York, down 0.5 percent. It rose to $91.88 on Dec. 27, the
highest level since Oct. 7, 2008. Canada is the largest supplier
of crude to the U.S.  Copper futures for March delivery traded at $4.318 a pound
after climbing yesterday to an all-time high of $4.335 a pound.
The Thomson Reuters /Jefferies CRB  Index  of raw materials
hovered near the highest level since Oct. 2, 2008. Canada
derives about half of its export revenue from commodities.  U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in December to a
reading of 52.5, lower than the most pessimistic forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, figures from the Conference
Board showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
