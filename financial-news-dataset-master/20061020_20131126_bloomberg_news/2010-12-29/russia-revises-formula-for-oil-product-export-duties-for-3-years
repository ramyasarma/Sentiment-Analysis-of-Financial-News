Russia will begin lowering the
export tax on light oil products such as gasoline while
increasing the levy on heavy crude products to encourage
domestic production of higher-value fuels.  The new duties, which are set monthly, may be levied as
early as Feb. 1,  Alexander Sakovich  a Finance Minister adviser,
said today by phone in Moscow. Light products include gasoline
and jet fuel, while heavy products include fuel oil and bitumen.  An increase on heavy products will affect  OAO Bashneft  and
Alliance Oil Co. the most in term of earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, said  Julia Novichenkova ,
an analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. OAO Lukoil will be the
least hurt because it already makes high-grade fuels, she said.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
want domestic refiners to produce more higher-quality products
to increase the value of Russia’s oil resources. The proposed
cuts are designed to encourage refinery upgrades and lower
exports of raw crude.  While Bashneft’s refineries are among the most up to date
in Russia, they produce lots of fuel oil, Novichenkova said.  2013 Convergence  The light-product export tax will be reduced to 67 percent
of the crude export duty next year and to 64 percent in 2012,
according to an order today on the government’s website. The
duty on heavy products will be raised to 46.7 percent of the
crude tax next year and 52.9 percent in 2012.  The levies for both heavy and light products will converge
at 60 percent of the crude export duty in 2013, the order said.  The state raised crude export duties 4.5 percent to $317.50
a metric ton ($43.30 a barrel) from Jan. 1, according to
calculations before the decision, the government said today.
