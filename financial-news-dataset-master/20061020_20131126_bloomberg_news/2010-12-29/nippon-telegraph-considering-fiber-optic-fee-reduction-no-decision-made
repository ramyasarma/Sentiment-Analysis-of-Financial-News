Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.
said it’s considering a reduction in fees for fiber-optic
services. No final decision has been made, according to a
statement on the company’s website.  The Nikkei newspaper earlier said NTT plans to cut fees for
fiber-optic service by as much as 40 percent, and may lower fees
charged to other phone companies for access to the fiber-optic
network by 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
