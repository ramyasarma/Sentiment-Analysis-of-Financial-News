Samsung Electronics Co.  will next
month unveil a digital media player that can play video, take
photos and connect to the Internet as the company adds another
product to compete with  Apple Inc. ’s touch-screen devices.  The “Galaxy Player,” powered by  Google Inc. ’s Android
software, has a front-facing camera that allows users to have
video chats and upload photos online using wireless networks,
Samsung said in a statement today. The device will go on sale in
the domestic market next month, Nam Ki Yung, a spokesman for the
Suwon, South Korea-based company, said by telephone.  Samsung has sought to challenge Apple’s iPhone and iPad
with its own Galaxy brand devices, using Android software. The
new product will directly compete with Apple’s iPod Touch and
help Samsung lure a wider range of customers with a brand name
it established with its Galaxy S smartphone, said  Kim Chang Yeul , a Seoul-based analyst at Mirae Asset Securities Co.  “It’s a natural extension of the product line-up,” he
said. “Apple put out the iPhone and iPad after promoting the
iPod as a revolutionary MP3 player. In case of Samsung, their
MP3 player didn’t do so well but they have a successful phone,
so they’re trying to build their product line-up on it.”  Samsung has sold more than 8 million units of the Galaxy S
handset globally since it began selling in June.  In September, Apple introduced the new iPod Touch which has
a sharper screen, front-facing camera and features that allow
video editing and face-to-face chats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
