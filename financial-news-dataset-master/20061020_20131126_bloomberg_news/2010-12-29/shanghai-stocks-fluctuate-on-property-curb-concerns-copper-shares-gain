China’s stocks  rose for the first
time in six days, led by drugmakers and retailers, on
speculation the benchmark index’s recent declines were excessive
relative to the outlook for earnings.  Shanghai Bailian Group Co. , the listed unit of China’s
biggest retailer, and  Suning Appliance Co.  advanced more than 2
percent. Yunnan Baiyao Group Co. and  Beijing Tongrentang Co. ,
traditional medicine companies, paced a rebound for drugmakers,
the worst performers in the past month. A weekend interest-rate
increase fueled concerns the government will take more measures
to curb asset bubbles, contributing to the Shanghai Composite
Index’s five-day, 5.9 percent slide, the longest since July.  “The recent drop has already largely reflected the
government’s tightening,” said  Zhang Ling , a fund manager at
Shanghai River Fund Management Co. “Stock valuations should be
fair at this level and the decline should come to a halt now.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 18.54, or 0.7 percent, to
2,751.53 at the 3 p.m. close. The gauge now trades at 17.7 times
reported earnings, compared with 32 times at the same time last
year, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg. The  CSI
300 Index  gained 0.6 percent 3,061.83 today.  The benchmark measure has fallen 16 percent in 2010, the
worst performer among the world’s 14 biggest stock indexes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The government has
ordered banks to set aside more reserves six times this year and
boosted rates twice to tame inflation and curb asset bubbles
after record gains in lending and property prices.  The expansion in the Chinese economy, which is set to
overtake Japan as the world’s second-biggest this year, will
sustain earnings growth of as much as 22 percent next year,
according to Morgan Stanley Huaxin strategist  Zhao Lisong .  Earnings Growth  China’s banking industry may have 800 billion yuan in
profit this year, the China Securities Journal reported, citing
Yang Zaiping, vice chairman of the nation’s banking association.
Industrial companies’ profits rose 49 percent in the 11 months
through November from a year earlier, a report showed, compared
with a 7.8 percent gain in the same period in 2009.  A measure tracking health-care stocks advanced 0.8 percent
on the CSI 300. The gauge has fallen 12 percent over the past
month, the most among the 10 industry groups.  Yunnan Baiyao rose 1.5 percent to 58.94 yuan. Tianjin Tasly
Pharmaceutical Co. added 1.8 percent to 38.15 yuan.  Beijing
Tongrentang Co.  gained 3.2 percent to 32.20 yuan.  Retailers including Suning Appliance are offering discounts
to drive sales before the New Year holidays from Jan. 1 to Jan.
3. The Chinese lunar new year holidays are from Feb. 2-8.  New Year Holidays  Shanghai Bailian climbed 3.4 percent to 15.05 yuan.  Suning, 
China’s biggest home appliance retailer by market value, gained
2.3 percent to 12.90 yuan. Dashang Group Co. climbed 2.5 percent
to 47.01 yuan.  A measure of energy stocks slid 1 percent, the most among
the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. slid
1.7 percent to 26.81 yuan.  Jiangxi Copper Co. , China’s biggest
producer of the metal, lost 1.5 percent to 40.56 yuan.  “Inflation will probably continue into next year and the
central bank will have to raise interest rates to fight
inflation,” said  Zhang Qi , an analyst at Haitong Securities Co.
in Shanghai. “That’ll squeeze valuations of stocks.”  China on Dec. 26 raised borrowing costs for the second time
since mid-October to counter the fastest inflation in more than
two years. The government will place more emphasis on inflation
controls and maintain “long term, stable and relatively fast”
economic growth, China National Radio reported yesterday, citing
Vice Premier  Li Keqiang .  The central bank will raise rates two more times in the
next six months to curb faster inflation, according to HSBC
Holdings Plc. The benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates
will rise by 25 basis points in each move,  Qu Hongbin  and  Sun Junwei , economists at HSBC, wrote in a report. They also
forecast banks’ reserve requirements will be increased 2
percentage points and that credit growth will be less than 16
percent in 2011.  -- Zhang Shidong ,  Irene Shen . Editors:  Allen Wan ,  Richard Frost   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
