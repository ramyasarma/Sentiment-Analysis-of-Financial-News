Desire Petroleum Plc , the U.K.
energy explorer, fell to the lowest since May after saying it
found no hydrocarbons in the Jacinta Prospect off the Falkland
Islands.  The shares fell 29 percent to 42.5 pence as of the 4:30
p.m. market close in London.  A well at the Jacinta field was drilled to target depth of
1,313 meters (4,000 feet) without finding oil or gas and will
now to about 1,670 meters to evaluate the Dawn Prospect, Desire
said today in a statement.  The company’s shares have slumped more than 70 percent
since October, when it said it failed to make a potentially
commercial discovery at the Rachel prospect. Rockhopper
Exploration Plc is the only company so far with a viable strike
near the South American islands over which Margaret Thatcher
went to war with Argentina to keep British in 1982.  To contact the reporter on this story:
