Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ,
the world’s largest producer of its namesake crop nutrient, rose
the most in more than four months in New York amid speculation
corn and soybean futures will extend price gains into next year.  Potash Corp.  climbed  $7.40, or 5.1 percent, to $152.07 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
percentage gain was the biggest since Aug. 17. The Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan-based company has risen 40 percent  this year .  “Supply and demand balances in corn and soybeans are tight
and are expected to remain tight,”  Horst Hueniken , a Toronto-
based analyst at Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., said today in a
telephone interview. “Crop prices are the only tangible
explanation for higher Potash Corp. shares.”  Corn and soybeans, which both climbed to 28-month records
this week in Chicago, are among the world’s most fertilizer-
intensive crops, according to the Paris-based  International
Fertilizer Industry Association .  Mosaic Co. , the world’s largest maker of phosphate-based
fertilizers, advanced $3.36, or 4.7 percent, to $74.80 in New
York.  Agrium Inc. , the largest retailer to U.S. farmers,
increased $3.90, or 4.5 percent, to $90.16.  World supplies of grain are likely to be tight until well
into 2011, according to  Alberto Weisser , chief executive officer
of  Bunge Ltd. , the Financial Times reported. Weisser predicted
in an interview with the newspaper that grain prices will stay
volatile in the next 12 months.  Increased Plantings  “Rising crop prices will lead farmers to plant more
acreage and spend more on fertilizer and the best-available
seeds to maximize crop yields,” Hueniken said.  Shares of crop-nutrient producers may also be rising
because of expectations that Canpotex Ltd., the international
potash marketing arm of Potash Corp., Mosaic and Agrium, may
soon sign a supply agreement with China for the first six months
of 2011, Hueniken said.  Potash Corp. CEO  Bill Doyle  told an investor conference
earlier this month in New York that a deal with China was
possible before the end of this year or early in 2011.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.75 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $6.24 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, corn advanced as high as $6.265, the highest since
August 2008.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 10 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $13.77 a bushel in Chicago. Yesterday, the price
reached $13.9675, the highest for the most-active contract since
August 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
