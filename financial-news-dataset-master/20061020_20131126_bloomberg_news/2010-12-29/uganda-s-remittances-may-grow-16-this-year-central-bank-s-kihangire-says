Remittances from Ugandans living
abroad may grow 16 percent this year, helped by a recovery from
the global financial crisis, the central bank said.  Inflows may climb to $930 million from $800 million in
2009, David Kihangire, executive director of research at Bank of
Uganda, said today in an interview in the capital, Kampala.  “There has been an improvement in the inflows,” he said.
“The worst of the global financial crisis is over.”  About 800,000 Ugandans live abroad, where many of them have
well-paid jobs that will help maintain a steady inflow of
remittances, Kihangire said.  Exports are the main source of the country’s earnings,
bringing in $3 billion annually, followed by foreign aid and
remittances, which contribute almost similar amounts, Kihangire
said. Uganda’s economy may expand as much as 7 percent in fiscal
2011, the central bank said on Dec. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
