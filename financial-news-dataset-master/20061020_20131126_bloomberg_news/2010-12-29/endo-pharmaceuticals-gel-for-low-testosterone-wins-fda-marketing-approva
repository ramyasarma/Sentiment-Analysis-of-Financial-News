Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. ,
the maker of pain medications, won U.S. approval to sell
Fortesta, a testosterone replacement therapy for men.  The Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug, a
transdermal gel that contains 2 percent testosterone, the
company said today in a statement.  Endo, based in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, will market the
drug for men with low testosterone. The condition, known as
 hypogonadism , can cause erectile dysfunction, infertility,
osteoporosis and muscle loss, according to the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota. Endo licensed Fortesta in August 2009 from
 ProStrakan Group Plc , based in Galashiels, Scotland. The drug is
sold in Europe under the names Tostran, Tostrex and Itnogen.  “The symptoms of low testosterone can be non-specific and
often associated with other chronic medical problems,” Adrian
Dobs, a professor at  Johns Hopkins University  School of Medicine
in Baltimore, and a principal investigator of the drug’s late-
stage trial, said in Endo’s statement. “Fortesta gel is an
important new treatment option for men who are diagnosed with
low testosterone.”  Endo plans to begin selling the treatment in early 2011,
the company said in its statement.  Endo increased 4.9 percent at 4:28 p.m. New York time in
extended  trading  after gaining 1 cent to $35.22 at the close of
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares have increased
72 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
