Treasuries gained after the
government’s $29 billion auction of seven-year notes produced
the highest demand from a group of investors including foreign
central banks since June 2009.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year security dropped the
most since the Labor Department’s payrolls report on June 4 as
the last U.S. note sale of 2010 spurred buying. Treasuries
tumbled yesterday after the $35 billion five-year auction
attracted the lowest demand in six months.  “It was a decently strong above-average auction,” said
 Joseph Leary , an interest-rate strategist in New York at
Citigroup Inc., one of the 18 primary dealers obligated to
participate in U.S. debt sales. “Foreigners and investment
funds showed up as they are trying to move out the curve to pick
up yield.”  The yield on the current seven-year note fell 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 2.72 percent at 5:17 p.m.
in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the
2.25 percent security maturing in November 2017 rose 30/32, or
$9.38 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 2/32.  The 10-year note  yield  dropped as much as 16 basis points
to 3.32 percent in the biggest decrease since June 4, when the
U.S. payrolls report showed employers added fewer jobs in May
than economists forecast.  Year-end rebalancing of portfolios buoyed U.S. debt today.
The duration of Barclays Plc’s U.S. Treasury Index will rise by
0.9 years this month, matching the historical high for any
December, according to a report from the primary dealer released
after yesterday’s close. Duration measures price sensitivity to
changes in yield and is partly a function of maturity.  ‘Window Dressing’  “We are seeing some window dressing of balance sheets
going into year-end, which should bode well for Treasuries the
rest of the year,” said  Christian Cooper , head of U.S. dollar
derivatives trading in New York at Jefferies Group Inc., another
primary dealer.  U.S. debt has returned 4.9 percent in 2010, more than
erasing last year’s 3.7 percent loss, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index. Investment-grade corporate debt has
returned 8.2 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
increased 13 percent.  At today’s offering of the December 2017 maturity, indirect
bidders, including foreign central banks, purchased 64.2 percent
of the notes, the highest level since June 2009. Direct bidders,
non-primary dealer investors that place their bids directly with
the Treasury, purchased 4.6 percent of the notes, compared with
8.5 percent last month and the 10-sale average of 10.4 percent.  Auction Yield  The seven-year notes drew a yield of 2.830 percent,
compared with the average forecast of 2.864 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 6 of the 18 primary dealers. The bid-
to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, was 2.86, compared with 2.63
at the Nov. 24 sale.  The 10-year note yield rose 15 basis points yesterday, the
most in two weeks, following the five-year note sale. The bid-
to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, was 2.61, the least since
June. Primary dealers ended up buying 58.2 percent of the
offering, the most since July 2009.  Treasuries advanced on Dec. 27, when the $35 billion sale
of two-year notes drew the highest level of demand in three
months. The government auctioned $99 billion in notes this week.  ‘Important Event’  “The seven-year auction was a very important event for
market direction into year-end,” Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts
including  George Goncalves  in New York wrote in a research note
today. The firm is a primary dealer. “Dealer balance sheets
were already strained by the two-year and five-year auctions,
but indirects stepped up, and that made for a stellar auction.”  U.S. government debt maturing in more than a year has
handed investors a loss of 2.7 percent in December, according to
figures compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. That’s the worst monthly
performance among 26 sovereign indexes.  Bond bears speculate that U.S. economic growth will pick up
in 2011, driven by the Federal Reserve’s second round of
government debt purchases known as quantitative easing, an
extension of tax cuts that President  Barack Obama  signed into
law this month and a widening of deficits.  Gross domestic product will expand at a pace of 3 to 3.5
percent in 2011,  Dean Maki , chief U.S. economist at Barclays in
New York, said yesterday in an interview with  Pimm Fox  on
Bloomberg Television’s “Bottom Line” program. The rate of
expansion was 2.6 percent in the third quarter.  “Growth in general will be fairly robust,” said Maki,
whose firm is a primary dealer. “We are favorable on the U.S.
stock market.”  The  Fed  bought $5.387 billion of Treasuries maturing from
June 2012 to June 2013 in the last scheduled operation of the
year under the asset-purchase program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
