South Korea raised its alert for
foot-and-mouth disease to the highest level on concern that an
outbreak that began last month may widen.  The government will set up a central disaster and safety
center involving related ministries to prevent the spread of the
disease, Maeng Hyung Kyu, the minister for public administration
and security, said today in a briefing broadcast on television.  The foot-and-mouth virus is one of the most contagious
animal diseases and can have high mortality rates in young
animals, according to the Paris-based  World Organization for
Animal Health , or OIE.  An outbreak of the disease reported in North Gyeongsang
Province on Nov. 28 had spread to five other Korean cities and
provinces, according to a public administration ministry
statement. The country has culled 480,551 animals, including
cattle and pigs, an agriculture ministry statement said.  The government has mobilized 172,348 quarantine personnel
including public servants, soldiers and the police for the
decontamination and culling process, the government said.
Authorities plan to complete limited vaccinations of animals
ahead of schedule, it said.  The North Asian nation was hit by foot-and-mouth disease in
2002 and two more times earlier this year. The virus infects
cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, pigs and sheep and can
cause foot lesions, weight loss and permanently reduce milk
production in cows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
