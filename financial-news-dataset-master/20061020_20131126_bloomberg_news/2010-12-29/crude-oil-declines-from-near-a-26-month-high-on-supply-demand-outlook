Crude oil fell from near a 26-month
high on speculation U.S. inventories will climb in January as
fuel demand drops in the world’s biggest oil-consuming country.  Futures slipped 0.4 percent after a report yesterday showed
an unexpected decline in U.S. consumer confidence. An Energy
Department report tomorrow may show that oil stockpiles shrank
last week as refiners delay delivery until 2011 to reduce tax
bills. Supplies have climbed during January in each of the past
four years.  “There’s a feeling that the market has gotten ahead of
itself,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest
in Chicago. “We’re now looking ahead to the new year and figure
that a lot of the bullish factors will fade away. After the
first of the year inventories should start to rise and the pre-
holiday rise in gasoline demand should come to a halt.”  Crude for February delivery fell 37 cents to settle at
$91.12 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract reached $91.88 on Dec. 27, the highest price since Oct.
7, 2008. Futures are up 15 percent this year.  Brent crude for February settlement declined 24 cents to
settle at $94.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Prices dropped from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
supplies increased 3.06 million barrels to 345.1 million last
week. February oil was down 49 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $91 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:33 p.m.  Consumer Confidence  Government data published yesterday showed a decline in
U.S. consumer confidence and a bigger-than-projected drop in
home values. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of U.S. property values
fell 0.8 percent in October from a year earlier, the group said
yesterday, and the New York-based Conference Board’s confidence
index dropped to 52.5, lower than the most pessimistic forecast
of 61 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The Energy Department will probably report that supplies of
crude oil  dropped  2.85 million barrels in the week ended Dec.
24, according to the median of 14 analyst responses in a
Bloomberg News survey. Inventories slipped 19 million barrels,
or 5.3 percent, in the three weeks ended Dec. 17.  The department will release its weekly report at 11 a.m.
tomorrow in Washington, a day later than usual because of the
Christmas holiday. The industry-funded API, which collects
stockpile information on a voluntary basis, also released its
report a day later than usual.  ‘Major Impact’  “We’re in the midst of light intra-holiday trading,” said
 Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin,
Texas-based energy consultant. “Tomorrow’s inventory report
could have a major impact on the market. We’ve had a series of
significant draws and this report could show yet another.”  Gasoline inventories  probably rose 1.5 million barrels,
according to the survey. It would be the sixth-straight gain.
Distillate inventories likely sank 625,000 barrels, the survey
showed.  Gasoline for January delivery slipped 1.52 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.3904 a gallon in New York. January-
delivery heating oil fell 0.28 cent to end the session at
$2.5215 a gallon.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump jumped 4.6 percent last
week, according to  MasterCard Inc.  Motorists bought an average
9.613 million barrels a day of gasoline in the week ended Dec.
24, up from 9.19 million barrels a day in the previous week,
 MasterCard Inc.  said in its weekly SpendingPulse report.  Brazilian Fields  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
producer, said that two oil fields in the Tupi and Iracema
deepwater areas hold 8.3 billion barrels of recoverable crude,
exceeding previous estimates.  The Lula field in the Tupi area has 6.5 billion barrels of
recoverable crude oil and equivalents and the Cernambi field at
Iracema holds 1.8 billion barrels, Rio de Janeiro-based
 Petrobras  said in a regulatory filing today. That’s up from a
previous estimate of a combined 5 billion to 8 billion barrels.  Petrobras, which currently has proven reserves of 14.9
billion barrels, aims to increase that volume to as much as 35
billion barrels by 2014 as it develops discoveries in the deep
waters of the Atlantic Ocean, where Tupi and Iracema lie. Tupi
is the second-biggest find in the Americas since Mexico
discovered Cantarell in 1976.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 226,703
contracts as of 4:33 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 208,060
contracts yesterday, 68 percent lower than the average over the
last three months. Open interest was 1.4 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
