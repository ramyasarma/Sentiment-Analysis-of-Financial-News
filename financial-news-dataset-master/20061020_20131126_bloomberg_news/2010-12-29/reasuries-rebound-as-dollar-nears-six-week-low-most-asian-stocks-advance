Treasuries rallied from the steepest
loss in two weeks and the dollar was near a six-week low against
the yen amid U.S. data that signaled an uneven recovery in the
world’s largest economy. Asian stocks rose, lifting the region’s
benchmark index to a 2 1/2-year high for a second day.  Ten-year  yields  slid three basis points to 3.45 percent at
5 p.m. in Tokyo, paring the 15 basis point gain yesterday. The

yen from 82.38 yen in New York. Copper jumped to a record in
London, where markets reopen after a two-day holiday. The  MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index  added 0.7 percent to 136.90, set for its
highest close since June 2008. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index and
futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index both rose 0.1 percent.  A surge in U.S. holiday spending was countered by reports
showing that consumer confidence unexpectedly fell and home
values dropped, with data tomorrow forecast to show businesses
expanded at a slower pace. Additional stimulus measures by the
Federal Reserve, which is preparing to buy notes today, have
fueled speculation the recovery will strengthen, helping Asian
stock and commodity markets to their second year of gains.  “The economy is growing gradually, but not enough to get
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates,” said  Yusuke Tanaka , senior dealer Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp. in
Singapore, part of Japan’s largest bank. “The yield’s rise is
overdone.”  Treasuries tumbled yesterday after a $35 billion sale of
five-year securities attracted the lowest demand since June,
sending yields to near a seven-month high.  Businesses, Consumers  Bonds have returned 4.9 percent in this year, recouping all
of 2009’s 3.7 percent loss, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. U.S. securities pared gains this quarter as Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  implemented a plan to pump $600 billion
into the banking system to maintain the expansion. The Fed today
may buy $4 billion to $6 billion of debt due from June 2012 to
June 2013 as part of its plan to spur the economy.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. will say
tomorrow its business  barometer  fell to 61.0 this month from
62.5 in November, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. The Conference Board’s  consumer
confidence  index fell in December to 52.5, lower than the most
pessimistic forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
figures showed yesterday.  South Korea’s benchmark five-year bonds fell for a fifth
day, their longest losing streak in seven weeks, after the surge
in U.S. yields. The yield on the 4 percent notes due September
2015 rose five basis points to 4.11 percent, the highest level
in more than a week, according to the Korea Stock Exchange.  Dollar, Euro  The U.S. currency yesterday touched 81.82 yen, the lowest
since Nov. 12. The greenback was at $1.0121 per Australian
dollar from $1.0100 yesterday, when it reached $1.0152, the
weakest since Nov. 9.  The euro fell against most of its 16 major counterparts
after the European Central Bank said it failed to fully
neutralize the extra liquidity created by its bond purchases for
a second time since the program began in May.  Oil for February delivery was little changed at $91.40
after yesterday climbing 0.5 percent to $91.49 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil closed at $91.51 on Dec. 23,
the highest since October 2008.  Copper rose as much as 1.1 percent to a record $9,447 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, which reopens today
after a two-day holiday. Futures on the Comex in New York was
little changed after yesterday reaching an all-time high of
$4.3350 a pound.  Cnooc Jumps  Cnooc Ltd.  gained 2.6 percent, helping energy producers to

wholesaler of rare earth products, jumped 16 percent in Hong
Kong trading after China cut its export quota for the minerals
in the first round of permits for 2011.  Sojitz Corp. , Japan’s
biggest rare earth importer that last month reached a deal with
Australian mining company  Lynas Corp. , gained 3.5 percent to the
highest level since April 21. Lynas soared 11 percent.  “Markets are thin and the moves we’re seeing right now
mean little,” said  Prasad Patkar , who helps manage about $1.8
billion in Sydney at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. “Investors
will look for resolution to Europe’s debt issues and China’s
inflation problems, but risk appetite will be better next year
than it was this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
