Crude oil may rise to $97.90 a
barrel after breaking higher from a “bullish flag” formation,
according to a technical analysis by Kase & Company Inc.  February crude futures rising from the flag formation last
week was “the most important factor” for the projected gain,
said  Dean Rogers , an analyst at the Albuquerque, New Mexico-
based consulting firm. “The move up may be choppy, especially
during the low-volume holiday week, but should test $94 over the
next few weeks.”  A bullish flag pattern shows trading consolidating within a
narrow range, preceded and followed by sharp rises. The latest
flag formed from Dec. 8 through Dec. 20 was very similar to
earlier flags that formed in September and October, both of
which broke higher and went on to make new highs, Rogers said in
an e-mail.  If prices decline, the first support level is at $90.60,
which should hold, Rogers said. “A test of support as low as
the $87.43 swing low could take place without significantly
dampening the likelihood of a continuation higher,” he said.  Crude oil for February delivery rose 49 cents, or 0.5
percent, yesterday to $91.49 a barrel. The contract reached
$91.88 on Dec. 27, the highest intraday price since May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
