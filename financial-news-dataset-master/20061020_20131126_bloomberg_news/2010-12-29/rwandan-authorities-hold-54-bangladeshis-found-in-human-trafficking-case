Rwandan police said they are holding
54 Bangladeshis who were on a human-trafficking route to
Mozambique.  The Bangladeshis were found in two groups and are now in
the capital, Kigali, where authorities are working with the
government of Bangladesh to return them to their homeland, Eric
Kayiranga, the police spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview.  “We suspect they were being trafficked to go and work on
farms of farmer-immigrants who left Zimbabwe for Mozambique,”
said Kayiranga.  A man who held the Bangladeshis’ travel documents was
arrested yesterday on suspicion of being behind the trafficking
operation, the spokesman said. He will be transferred to
Mozambique, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
