Rice futures rose the most allowed
by the Chicago Board of Trade on expectations for lower
production from Thailand, the world’s biggest exporter, because
of flooding.  Output from Thailand’s main harvest, which started in
October, may drop 5.3 percent, the Office of Agricultural
Economics said last week. As of Dec. 16, U.S. export sales in
the marketing year that started Aug. 1 were 22 percent higher
than a year earlier, government  data  show. A state-run South
Korean agency said it purchased 168,905 metric tons of the
grain last week from unspecified sources.  “Asian destinations are more aggressive buyers of U.S.
rice,” said  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president for the
Linn group in Chicago.  Rice futures for March delivery rose by the exchange limit
of 50 cents, or 3.7 percent, to close at $13.88 per 100 pounds
at 1:15 p.m. on the CBOT. Yesterday, the price touched $13.33,
the lowest for a most-active contract since Nov. 29.  The commodity has jumped 43 percent since the end of June
as flooding damaged crops in Thailand and Pakistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
