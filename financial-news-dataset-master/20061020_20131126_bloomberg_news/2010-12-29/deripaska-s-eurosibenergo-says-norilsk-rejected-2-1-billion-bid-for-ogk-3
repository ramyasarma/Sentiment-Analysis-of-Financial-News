EuroSibEnergo Plc, Russian
billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s power utility, said OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel’s board rejected its $2.1 billion cash offer for a 79
percent stake in OAO OGK-3.  EuroSibEnergo is “disappointed that Norilsk Nickel chose
to ignore” the company’s cash offer for the OGK-3 power
generator, Elena Rollins, a spokeswoman for Deripaska’s company,
said today in an e-mail.  Norilsk decided to sell OGK-3 to OAO Inter RAO UES, the
state-run utility, Interfax reported late yesterday, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the board decision. Maria
Uvarova, a spokeswoman for the nickel producer in Moscow,
declined to comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
