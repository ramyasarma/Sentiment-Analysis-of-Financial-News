Chinese prosecutors investigated
more than 240,000 embezzlement, bribery and other cases
involving official corruption from 2003 to 2009, according to a
government report released today.  China’s State Council , the country’s cabinet, said in a 39-
page report that official corruption has evolved in the more
than three decades since China initiated economic policies
opening the country to private enterprise and foreign
investment.  Officials recently have been prosecuted for crimes such as
aiding “underworld and evil forces” and corruption causing
“mass disturbances and major accidents,” the report said. In
the 1980s prosecutions focused on corruption that took advantage
of a two-tiered price system, and 1990s corruption centered on
embezzlement, misappropriation of public funds and “bending the
law,” it said.  Today’s report comes after several official graft cases
made headlines across the country. Last year authorities in
central China’s Chongqing Municipality arrested more than 1,500
people in connection with bribing police and government
officials, smuggling and running illegal businesses. In 2008
 Chen Liangyu , the former Communist Party head of Shanghai, was
sentenced to 18 years in jail for taking bribes and abuse of
power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
