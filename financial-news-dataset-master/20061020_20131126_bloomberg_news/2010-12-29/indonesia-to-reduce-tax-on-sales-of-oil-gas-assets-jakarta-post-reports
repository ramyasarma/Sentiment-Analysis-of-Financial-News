The Indonesian government will cut
the income tax on the sales of oil and gas blocks to help boost
investment in the energy sector, the Jakarta Post reported,

the exploration stage will be reduced to 5 percent from 20
percent and for assets at the exploitation stage to 7 percent,
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
