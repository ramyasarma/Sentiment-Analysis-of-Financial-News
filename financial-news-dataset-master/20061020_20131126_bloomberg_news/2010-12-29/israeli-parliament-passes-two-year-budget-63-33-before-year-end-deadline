Israel’s parliament approved Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s two-year budget for 2011-12, which
increases spending for education and employment programs, ahead
of a year-end deadline.  The 120-member Knesset backed the  spending package  by 63
votes to 33 today. The balloting, the last of three needed to
pass the budget, was broadcast live on parliamentary television.  The 367 billion-shekel ($103 billion)  budget  for 2011 and
385 billion-shekel spending plan for 2012 is the second two-year
budget instituted by the government. The budget was submitted in
October to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, which passed it in
a first reading and sent it to the  Finance Committee , which
approved it last week.  The  Knesset  had to pass the proposal by midnight Dec. 31 or
the current budget would have continued to run until a new
spending plan was approved for this country of 7.7 million
people.  The budget calls for a deficit of 3 percent of gross
domestic product next year and 2 percent in 2012, the Finance
Ministry said in an e-mailed statement. Expenditure will
increase by 2.7 percent in both years. The Finance Ministry said
the deficit target is based on the assumption of 3.8 percent GDP
growth in 2011 and 4 percent growth in 2012.  The budget allocates more spending for education, adding
about 2 billion shekels for schooling, Finance Minister  Yuval Steinitz  said in an interview on Army Radio yesterday.  Children, Mothers  The budget plan includes more funding for subsidies for day
care for children, which will encourage mothers to go out to
work, reducing poverty, the prime minister’s office said in an
e-mailed statement. The plan also includes funding for special
programs to encourage Arab women and ultra-Orthodox men to join
the labor force, it said.  The Israeli economy will expand 4 percent in 2011, compared
with 2.3 percent on average for Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development countries, the Paris-based group
said on Nov. 18. Unemployment is expected to fall to 6.1
percent, compared with the OECD average of 8.1 percent,
according to the forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
