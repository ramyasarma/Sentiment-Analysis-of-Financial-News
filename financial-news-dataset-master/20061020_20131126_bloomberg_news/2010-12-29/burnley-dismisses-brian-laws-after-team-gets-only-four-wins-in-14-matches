Burnley soccer club fired manager
Brian Laws after the English second-division team won only four
of its last 14 matches.  Burnley chairman Barry Kilby said he called Laws today and
asked him to resign. The manager took over in January, and
wasn’t able to keep the team from being relegated from the
Premier League last season. Burnley is in ninth place in the
Championship.  “Everyone is naturally disappointed and frustrated that
recent results have not gone as we would have hoped,” Kilby
said in a statement on the club website. “We need a fresh
approach in order to achieve our goal of returning to the
Premier League.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
