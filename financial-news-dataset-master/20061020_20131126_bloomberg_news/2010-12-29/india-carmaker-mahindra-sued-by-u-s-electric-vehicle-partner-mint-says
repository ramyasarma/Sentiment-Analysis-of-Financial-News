Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.’s Reva
Electric Vehicles unit was sued by New York-based Bannon
Automotive LLC, which alleges the carmaker violated its
agreement, the  Mint newspaper  said, citing court documents.  Bannon seeks a permanent injunction to prevent Reva from
making or selling electric vehicles in the U.S., saying the
company reneged on an agreement by failing to cooperate on
sharing technology and prototypes of the two-seater NXG and
four-seater NXR, according to the newspaper report. Mahindra
has 20 days to respond to the complaint, the report said.  “We have not received any formal communication from
Bannon or its lawyers,” Mahindra Reva said in an e-mailed
reply to questions. “Once we receive it and are able to
review the matter, we will respond appropriately.”  Bannon didn’t immediately return calls to its office
after business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
