BYD Co., the Chinese automaker
backed by Warren Buffett, will likely miss its 600,000 unit
target for auto sales in 2010, spokesman Paul Lin said by phone
today.  The Hong Kong-listed carmaker will likely sell 520,000 to
550,000 cars this year, he said. BYD cut its target to 600,000
vehicles from 800,000 in August.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
