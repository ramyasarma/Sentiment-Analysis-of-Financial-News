Uganda’s stock exchange approved a
secondary listing of shares by  Centum Investment Co.  of Kenya,
said Joseph Kitamirike, chief executive officer of the bourse.  Centum, East Africa’s biggest public traded investment
company, is expected to start trading on the Ugandan Securities
Exchange by February, Kitamirike said in an interview today in
the capital, Kampala. The listing will boost investment options
in Uganda and raise the capitalization of the bourse, he said.  The Ugandan bourse, which began operations in 1998, has 13
listed companies, six of which are secondary listings by Kenyan
companies. The exchange’s market capitalization is currently
12.8 trillion shillings ($5.5 billion), according to its
 website .  The exchange expects “four or five major listings” next
year, Kitamirike said. He declined to name the companies.  Uganda’s  All Share Index  has advanced 62 percent so far in
2010 to 1,190.77 and is Africa’s best-performing market this
year, according to Bloomberg data.  “The improvement is big because we are going through a
period of recovery” after the global financial crisis,
Kitamirike said. “We are going to do our best next year because
we shall increase in the number of listings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
