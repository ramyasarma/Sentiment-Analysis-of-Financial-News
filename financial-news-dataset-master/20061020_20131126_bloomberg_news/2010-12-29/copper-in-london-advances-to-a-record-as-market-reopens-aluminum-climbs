Copper jumped to a record on the
London Metal Exchange, catching up with gains in other metals
markets as trading resumed today after a two-day holiday.
Aluminum, zinc and lead also climbed.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose as
much as 1.1 percent to $9,447 a metric ton, surpassing the
previous peak of $9,392 reached on Dec. 21. The contract traded
at $9,436.25 by 7:28 a.m. London time, up 28 percent this year
and on track for a second annual gain.  “The industrial metals are going to be strong,”  Edward Morse , head of commodity research at Credit Suisse Group AG.,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “They’re at record
prices, copper’s at a record price but it should go to even
higher heights because it’s highly supply-constrained,”  Futures on the Comex in New York were little changed at
$4.3270 a pound after reaching a record $4.3350 yesterday. The
metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
advanced for a second day, rising 0.7 percent to close at 69,510
yuan ($10,497) a ton.  Copper stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 7,410 tons to 120,426 tons last week, the
biggest decrease since the week ending Sept. 9, boosting the
demand outlook in China, the world’s largest user.  Inventories 
in LME warehouses are down 26 percent this year, on course for
the first annual decline since 2004.  “This momentum we’re seeing in commodities as an asset
class will probably continue into 2011,”  Edward Meir , senior
analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd., said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “However, the danger with these things,
as with all these spirals, is that when prices get too high you
inevitably trigger some consequences. In the case of
commodities, we could get inflationary pressures, you could
trigger demand destruction, you can generate substitution.”  Aluminum in London climbed 2.1 percent to $2,462 a ton,
zinc jumped 2.7 percent to $2,371 a ton, and lead advanced 2.5
percent to $2,490 a ton. Nickel was little changed at $24,170 a
ton, while tin rose 0.2 percent to $26,850 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
