The U.S. dollar will keep its
reserve currency status in 2011 amid broad demand for
Treasuries, according to Pacific Investment Management Co.,
which controls the world’s biggest bond fund.  China isn’t ready to absorb the world’s reserve assets and
Europe “isn’t even close” to reserve status, according to an
e-mailed report by Anthony Crescenzi, a bond strategist
at Newport Beach, California-based Pimco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
