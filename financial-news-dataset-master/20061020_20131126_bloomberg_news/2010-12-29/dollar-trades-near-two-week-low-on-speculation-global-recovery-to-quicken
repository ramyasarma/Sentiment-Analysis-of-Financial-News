The  Dollar Index  fell, paring a
yearly advance, as signs the global recovery is gathering
momentum spurred demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Australian dollar traded at the strongest since it was
freely floated, South Korea’s won gained, South Africa’s rand
rose to the highest in three years. Japan’s yen reached a seven-
week high amid speculation China will allow the yuan to
appreciate at a faster pace. The Swiss franc climbed to a record
and the euro strengthened against the U.S. currency.  “Emerging-market currencies are stronger,” said  You-Na Park , a currency strategist at  Commerzbank AG  in Frankfurt. “We
have monetary-policy tightening so these currencies are
attractive compared with the U.S. dollar.”  The  Dollar Index , which  IntercontinentalExchange Inc . uses
to track the dollar against the currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, slipped almost 0.2 percent to 79.66 as of 7:22 a.m. in
New York. It’s headed for a 2.3 percent advance from the end of
last year.  The dollar weakened to $1.3256 per euro from $1.3225 in New
York yesterday. The U.S. currency declined to 93.83 Swiss
centimes from 94.56 centimes, after touching a record low of
93.74 centimes. The franc appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to
an all-time high of 1.2402 against the euro.  U.S., Italian Data  Data today may show U.S. initial jobless claims declined,
while Italian business confidence rose to the highest level in
almost three years, helping boost demand for currencies that
benefit the most from global growth.  First-time filings for U.S. jobless insurance decreased to
415,000 in the week ended Dec. 25 from 420,000 in the previous
week, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists before
the Labor Department data.  The Isae institute’s index of Italy’s manufacturing-
sentiment climbed to 103, the highest since February 2008. The
Eurocoin index measuring economic expansion in the euro area
rose to 0.49 percent in December from 0.45 percent the previous
month, the London-based Center for Economic Policy Research and
the Bank of Italy, which co-produce the index, said today. Italy
sold 6 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2013 and 2021 and 2.1
billion euros of floating-rate notes due 2015 and 2017.  South Korea’s won gained the most in two months versus the
dollar as the central bank forecast its current-account surplus
will widen. The nation’s industrial output expanded 10.4 percent
in November from a year earlier, its 17th straight increase,
Statistics Korea said in Gwacheon today.  Korean Surplus  Bank of Korea official Lee Young Bog forecast his nation’s
current-account surplus will widen in December, reaching some
$29 billion for the year. South Korea’s currency rose for a
fourth day, gaining 1 percent, the most since Oct. 6, to
1,134.85 per dollar. Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.9 percent to
NT$29.125 against its U.S. counterpart. The nation’s central
bank raised borrowing costs today for the third time this year.  “There are a lot of real-money managers who are looking to
put on long Asian-currencies positions going into 2011,” said
 Kurt Magnus , executive director of foreign-exchange sales at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in Sydney. “It’s a lot to do with growth.
There’s a clear move away from the dollar into Asia.”  Japan’s currency gained for a ninth day versus the dollar,
its longest winning streak since October 2004, after the
People’s Bank of China set the reference rate for the yuan
stronger for an eighth day. The value of Japanese exports to
China, Japan’s biggest market, advanced 18.3 percent in November
from a year earlier, compared with a 17.6 percent increase in
October, the Finance Ministry in Tokyo said last week.  ‘Gradual Appreciation’  Small and gradual appreciation of the yuan has helped more
than it’s hurt China’s economy, Sheng Shongcheng, head of the
central bank’s statistics and analysis department, said in a
speech published today by the Financial News newspaper.  “China appears to be letting its currency strengthen to
fight inflation,” said  Marito Ueda , senior managing director at
 FX Prime Corp . a foreign-exchange margin company in Tokyo. “The
bias is for the yen to appreciate.”  The PBOC set its daily reference rate at 6.6229 per dollar,
compared with 6.6247 yesterday.  Japan’s currency strengthened to 81.58 yen per dollar from
81.62 yesterday. It earlier touched 81.29, the strongest since
Nov. 9. The yen and Australian dollar have risen more than 12
percent against the dollar this year, the most amongst major
currencies.  Rand Rises  South Africa’s rand, the third-best performer this year,
strengthened 0.3 percent to 6.6355 per dollar after reaching
6.5826 per dollar, the strongest since November 2007, as prices
for precious metals advanced.  Australia’s dollar weakened to $1.0152 from $1.0179
yesterday. It earlier touched $1.0198, the highest level since
July 1982, before the December 1983 move by the nation to stop
pegging the so-called Aussie to a trade-weighted basket of
currencies.  The euro was at 108.13 yen from 107.94 yen, after earlier
slipping to 107.61 yen, the weakest since Sept. 14.  Switzerland’s central bank may increase interest rates
before the European Central Bank or Federal Reserve,
Commerzbank’s Park said. The nation’s leading economic
indicator, which aims to predict the economy’s direction about
six months ahead, was 2.1 in December, the KOF research
institute in Zurich said yesterday, matching analyst estimates.
The 10-year  average  for the gauge is 1.13.  The Fed reiterated this month its commitment to keep
borrowing costs low for an “extended period.” Policy makers
said Dec. 14 they would keep the  target rate  for overnight
lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent, where it has been
since December 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
