A new German law will help the state
to restructure lenders and avoid having to bail out banks whose
collapse may hurt the industry and wider economy, the Federal
Agency for Financial Market Stabilization said.  Beginning in 2011, the FMSA will oversee a restructuring
fund and collect a bank levy that’ll enable it to reorganize
lenders and protect systemically relevant parts of struggling
banks, according to an e-mailed statement today.  Under the new law, German authorities can transfer
systemically relevant parts of a bank to another lender or place
those activities in a newly created “bridge bank” to allow the
continuation and restructuring of operations, the FMSA said. The
remaining assets may be wound down in insolvency proceedings.
The restructuring fund can provide capital or guarantees to the
bridge bank using money from the levy.  Germany passed a law in November that includes a levy on
the country’s lenders to set up a 70 billion-euro ($92 billion)
fund for future bailouts and measures to help wind down lenders,
as the country seeks to reduce the risk of taxpayers footing the
bill for financial crises.  “In the future, the banking sector will contribute to the
costs of stabilization measures, reducing the likelihood that
the state will be forced to rescue systemically relevant banks
because of the ‘too big to fail’ argument,” said  Hannes Rehm ,
head of the FMSA’s management committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
