Asian gasoline’s premium to naphtha
widened after prices of the motor fuel reached a two-year high.
Glencore International AG was said to sell its second naphtha
cargo to BP Plc this week.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent crude, or
the crack spread, fell to $172.15 a metric ton at 5:15 p.m.
Singapore time from $176.16 a ton yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Open-specification naphtha  for delivery
to Japan dropped $1, or 0.1 percent, to $882 a ton.  Benchmark  92-RON gasoline  rose 0.5 percent to $103.10 a
barrel, the highest since September 2008. Gasoline’s premium to
naphtha, or the  reforming margin , rose to $6.85 a barrel from
$6.20 yesterday, Bloomberg calculations showed. A wider gap
signals that naphtha production is less valuable to refiners
relative to gasoline.  BP bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for first-half March
delivery from Glencore at $880 a ton, traders said. The European
refiner yesterday bought a second-half February cargo from
Glencore at $884 a ton.  ConocoPhillips sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline
loading Jan. 13 to Jan. 17 to BP at $103.20 a barrel. BP bought
50,000 barrels of the same grade from Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. at
$103.10 a barrel. Total SA sold 50,000 barrels of 97-RON motor
fuel to Royal Dutch Shell at $106.40 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Benchmark  gasoil  cargoes in Singapore with 0.5 percent
sulfur rebounded 70 cents, or 0.7 percent, from yesterday to
$104.85 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Jet fuel  gained 5 cents
to $105.35.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude fell 39 cents to $13.56 a
barrel, according to PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage. This  crack
spread , a measure of refining profit, was at the narrowest since
Dec. 21.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil declined for a second day,
losing 5 cents to $1.35 a barrel, PVM said. The so-called
 regrade  has gained 17 percent in the past two weeks, indicating
aviation-fuel production remains profitable compared with
gasoil, or diesel.  Fuel Oil  Losses from refining fuel oil in Singapore narrowed for a
second day.  Asian benchmark fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or the
 crack spread , narrowed to $10.64 a barrel from $11.35 yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The price of  180-centistoke fuel oil  cargoes rose 0.5
percent to $515.75 a ton while  380-centistoke fuel oil , mainly
used as marine fuel, increased 0.6 percent to $506.75 a ton.
Dubai crude fell 0.4 percent to $90.60 a barrel.  Westport Petroleum Inc. bought 40,000 tons of 380-
centistoke fuel oil from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at a premium of
75 cents a ton over Singapore assessments published by Platts,
according to two traders. The cargo will load between Jan. 13
and Jan. 17.  -- Editors: Alexander Kwiatkowski, Clyde Russell  To contact the reporter on this story:
