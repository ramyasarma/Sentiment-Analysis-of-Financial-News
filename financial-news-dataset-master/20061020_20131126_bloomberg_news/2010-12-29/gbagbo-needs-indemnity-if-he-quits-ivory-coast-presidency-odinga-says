Ivory Coast’s President,  Laurent Gbagbo , should receive indemnity if he agrees to step down, said
Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga , the African Union’s special
envoy on the political crisis in the West African nation.  “Gbagbo should be given the guarantee that by stepping
down nothing will happen to him,” Odinga said in an interview
broadcast today by Citizen TV, based in the Kenyan capital,
Nairobi.  Gbagbo has refused to relinquish power to  Alassane Ouattara , regarded by the United Nations, the African Union, the
U.S. and France as the winner of the Nov. 28 election.
Presidents  Thomas Boni Yayi  of Benin,  Pedro Pires  of Cape Verde
and  Ernest Koroma  of Sierra Leone held talks with Gbagbo in the
commercial capital, Abidjan, yesterday to urge him to leave
office or risk possible military intervention by states in the
region.  The political crisis has driven up the price of cocoa and
pushed the yields of Ivory Coast’s Eurobonds to a record 14.71
percent on Dec. 27. Cocoa has risen 8.3 percent since the
election on London’s Liffe exchange and was trading as high as
2,049 pounds ($3,153) per metric ton today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
