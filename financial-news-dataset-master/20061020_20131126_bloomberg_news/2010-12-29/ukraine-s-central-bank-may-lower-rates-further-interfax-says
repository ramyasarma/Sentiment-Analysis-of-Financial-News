Ukraine’s central bank will probably
continue lowering borrowing costs next year if inflation
expectations remain positive,  Interfax-Ukraine  newswire
reported, citing the deputy head of bank’s monetary policy
department.  The  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  will sustain its trend of
gradually lowering rates, the Kiev-based newswire quoted
Oleksandr Arsenyuk as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
