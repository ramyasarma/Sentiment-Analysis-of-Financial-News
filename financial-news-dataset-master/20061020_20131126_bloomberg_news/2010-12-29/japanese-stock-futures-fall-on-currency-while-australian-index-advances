Japanese  stock   futures  fell as the
dollar weakened to a seven-week low against the yen, reducing
the outlook for Japanese companies’ overseas earnings.
Australian stocks rose.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. , which is the
world’s largest maker of cameras and gets about 80 percent of
its sales outside Japan, lost 0.7 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-biggest
automaker by sales, retreated 1.1 percent. Newcrest Mining Ltd.,
Australia’s largest gold producer, rose 1.3 percent today, the
biggest gain in Australia’s blue-chip index.  “The yen’s appreciation will hang over the market” in
Japan, said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in
Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “I don’t think
people are rushing to sell stocks to lock in profits, because
there are strong expectations that stocks will rise next year.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 10,310 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,340 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,300
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.4 percent today, and New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index was little changed.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index gained 0.1 percent yesterday, led by
energy companies as crude oil remained above $90 a barrel for a
fifth straight day.  Crude oil for February delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
settle at $91.12 a barrel in New York yesterday. Copper futures
declined 0.4 percent, after rising to a record this week.  Valuations, Currency  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 14 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 13 percent by the S&P
500 and 11 percent the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.9 times estimated earnings on
average at yesterday’s close, compared with 14.8 times for the
S&P 500 and 12.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  The dollar weakened against the yen for an eighth straight
session yesterday, the longest streak since 2004. It depreciated
to 81.61 yen, the strongest intraday level since Nov. 10. A
lower dollar reduces the value of U.S. income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  The yen is headed for its strongest annual average level
against the dollar since currencies began trading freely in 1971,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s
closing price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
