U.S. stocks rose, with the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  extending its biggest December rally since
1991, led by energy companies as crude oil remained above $90
for a fifth straight day.  Schlumberger Ltd., the largest oilfield services provider,
and Occidental Petroleum Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. oil and
natural gas producer by market value, led energy companies to
the biggest gain among 10 industries in the S&P 500. BJ’s
Wholesale Club Inc. jumped 7.1 percent after the New York Post
said it may receive a takeover bid. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Morgan Stanley declined after  Mike Mayo , an analyst, reduced
earnings estimates.  The S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent to 1,259.78 as of 4 p.m. in
New York, the highest since Sept. 8, 2008, and its 13th gain in
the past 15 trading days. The  Dow  average climbed 9.84 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 11,585.38, its highest on a closing basis
since August 2008.  “The longer oil stays above $90, the more people are
convinced there’s a more stable price deck above $80 and
potentially higher,” said  Michael Shinnick , a money manager in
South Bend, Indiana, for Wasatch Advisors Inc., which has $8.5
billion under management. “As a group, energy stocks haven’t
priced in $80- to $90-a-barrel oil.”  The  S&P 500  has gained 6.7 percent this month. Last week it
closed above 1,251.70 for the first time since Sept. 12, 2008,
the last trading day before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed
the world’s biggest bankruptcy and prompted a 46 percent drop
for the benchmark gauge through March 2009. Industry reports on
business conditions and pending home sales tomorrow are expected
to show growth, according to economist forecasts.  Spur Growth  The index has surged 20 percent since Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  suggested on Aug. 27 that he was
prepared to purchase more bonds to spur economic growth. The
central bank eventually announced that second round of
quantitative easing in November, while President  Barack Obama 
this month agreed to extend tax cuts to aid the recovery.  “We are going to have more of the same next year,” said
 Thomas Steinemann , chief strategist at Vontobel Asset Management
Ltd. in Zurich, whose parent company manages about $80 billion.
“There is enormous fiscal stimulus. Where it all leads is
another question, but the surprise is probably on the upside for
the economy and for equities.”  The S&P 500 may end 2011 at 1,374, or 9.2 percent higher
than yesterday’s close, according to the average of 11 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Trading Slows  Trading slowed this week as a snowstorm hit the U.S. east
coast after the Christmas holiday break. About 468 million
shares changed hands on the NYSE on Dec. 27, the fewest for a
full-day session since May 1998, while 560 million shares were
traded in yesterday’s session and 520 million today. The average
over the past 100 days is 1.01 billion.  As many as 1.2 million airline customers may have been
affected by almost 8,000 flight cancellations as the storm that
hit three days ago closed major airports.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.’s business
barometer, a gauge of business conditions, is forecast to show a
15th consecutive month of expansion in December. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey is 61 after a reading of 62.5 in
November. Readings above 50 indicate improving conditions.  Pending sales of previously owned homes probably rose 0.5
percent in November from the prior month, according to the
median estimate.  Schlumberger, Occidental  Schlumberger rose 1.7 percent to $83.63 and was the biggest
contributor to the S&P 500’s gain. Occidental advanced 1.4
percent to $99.03. Energy companies in the index rose 0.8
percent as a group.  Crude oil is trading over $90 for the first time since
October 2008 amid signs global demand is picking up. Crude for
February delivery fell 37 cents to $91.12 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange today.  BJ’s jumped 7.1 percent to $47.62. Private-equity firm
Leonard Green & Partners LP may present a hostile takeover bid
for the third-largest U.S. wholesale chain if the retailer
doesn’t auction itself “in the coming weeks,” the New York
Post said, citing unidentified sources.  Goldman Sachs  declined 0.9 percent to $167.63 and Morgan
Stanley fell 1.4 percent to $27.28.  Mike Mayo  at Credit Agricole
Securities USA Inc. lowered fourth-quarter earnings estimates
for the two securities firms, citing lower-than-expected trading
in their fixed-income, currencies and commodities units.  Noble Energy Rises  Noble Energy Inc. advanced 2.6 percent to $87.16. The oil
and natural-gas producer announced in a statement a
“significant” natural gas discovery at the Leviathan
exploration prospect off Israel’s coast.  Monsanto Co.  rose 2.7 percent to $68.92. The world’s
biggest seed company may get an earnings boost of 15 cents to 30
cents a share from a recent 20 percent increase in glyphosate
prices in China,  Michael Cox , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos.
in Minneapolis, said in a report.  MBIA Inc. jumped 8.8 percent to $10.36 after JPMorgan Chase
Bank NA and Barclay’s Bank Plc said they are withdrawing from a
lawsuit over the company’s decision to split its insurance unit
in two. The lawsuit filed in May 2009 by 18 of the world’s
largest financial companies will continue for the remaining
plaintiffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
