The value of the world’s most
expensive items sold at auction more than doubled in 2010 as the
top end of the market bounced back from the financial crisis.  The priciest 10 lots amounted to $698.6 million, compared
with the combined $326.1 million of 2009, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  Buyers around the globe snapped up works by trophy-name
20th-century artists, and historic Chinese art ousted European
Old Masters as the other main contributor.  Sotheby’s  and  Christie’s International  sold 1,201 lots for
$1 million or more, including 75 lots that ranged from $10
million to $106.5 million.  Here are the year’s 10 most valuable artworks at auction.  1.  Pablo Picasso ’s 1932 painting of his mistress Marie-
Therese Walter sold for $106.5 million, an auction record for
any artwork, at Christie’s in New York on May 4. Consigned by
the estate of Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Brody, “Nude,
Green Leaves and Bust” went to an anonymous phone bidder.  2.  Alberto Giacometti ’s 1961 bronze “Walking Man I”
fetched an artist record 65 million pounds (then $103.4 million)
at Sotheby’s in London on Feb. 3. From the collection of
Germany-based Dresdner Bank AG, the statue was one of 10 cast in
the Swiss artist’s lifetime and was estimated to sell for
between 12 million pounds and 18 million pounds. The buyer was
the London-based billionaire  Lily Safra , said dealers.  3. A Qianlong-dynasty vase sold for a surprise 51.6 million
pounds (then $83.2 million) -- a record for Chinese art -- at
 Bainbridges  in west London on Nov. 11. The elaborately decorated
Imperial porcelain, valued at 800,000 pounds to 1.2 million
pounds, had been discovered during a routine house clearance in
the London suburb of Pinner. Auctioneer Peter Bainbridge broke
his gavel as he sold the vase to a Beijing-based agent sitting
at the front of the salesroom.  4.  Amedeo Modigliani ’s 1917 languid, pink-fleshed nude
fetched $68.96 million at Sotheby’s in New York on Nov. 2, an
auction record for the artist. Five bidders competed for “Nu
Assis sur un Divan (La Belle Romaine),” propelling the work
past the $40 million presale estimate.  5. A Song Dynasty scroll painting sold to a phone bidder
for 436.8 million yuan ($65.9 million) at  Beijing Poly
International Auction Co.  on June 3. The 38-foot-long collection
of inscriptions, titled “Di Zhu Ming,” had been amassed over
800 years and was completed by the calligrapher Huang Tingjian
in 1095.  6.  Andy Warhol ’s black-and-white silkscreen showing images
of  Elizabeth Taylor , her third husband Mike Todd and her future
husband  Eddie Fisher  sold for $63.4 million at Phillips de Pury
in New York on Nov. 8. This was the second-priciest Warhol sold
at auction. The 1962 canvas “Men in Her Life” appeared in a
sale put together by private art dealer  Philippe Segalot .  7. Following the success of his “Walking Man,”
Giacometti’s flattened bronze head, said to be of his brother
Diego, fetched $53.3 million at Christie’s on May 4, more than
doubling its low estimate of $25 million. Brody, whose estate
consigned the work, bought it for $1,800 in 1955.  8. A modernist limestone head by Modigliani sold at an
auction in Paris for 43.2 million euros (then $53 million) on
June 14. The price, paid by a phone buyer, was more than 10
times the low estimate and a record for any work of art sold at
a French auction.  9. Picasso’s 1903 portrait of the artist Angel de Soto
raised 34.8 million pounds ($52 million) for  Andrew Lloyd Webber ’s charitable foundation at Christie’s London on June 23.
The “Blue Period” canvas, bought by a phone bidder, had been
estimated to sell for as much as 40 million pounds. It had been
acquired by the composer’s foundation for $29.2 million in 1995.  10.  Henri Matisse ’s bronze relief of a nude woman depicted
from the back drew $48.8 million, establishing an auction record
for the French master at Christie’s on Nov. 3. Cast in 1978, 24
years after the artist’s death, the piece came from an edition
of 10. Dealer  Larry Gagosian  bought the work for a client.  To contact the reporters of this story:
