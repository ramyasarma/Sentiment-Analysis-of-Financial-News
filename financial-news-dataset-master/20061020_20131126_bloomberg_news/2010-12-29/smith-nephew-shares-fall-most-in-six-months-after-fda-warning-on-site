Smith & Nephew Plc  fell in London
trading after the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  said it sent
a  warning letter  to the British medical device maker about
quality control at its German plant.  The London-based manufacturer of artificial knees and hips
dropped 9 pence, or 1.3 percent, to 677 pence, giving it a
market value of 6 billion pounds ($9.3 billion).  In a letter dated Dec. 21, and posted on its website
yesterday, the FDA said its inspectors noted quality control
problems with the sterilization of hip implant parts at the
company’s Tuttlingen plant during a visit in mid-July. The FDA
said Smith & Nephew’s response was inadequate.  Liz Hewitt , a spokeswoman for the company, said the warning
has no effect on customers or product supply because Smith &
Nephew also makes the parts at plants in Memphis, Tennessee, and
Warwick, England. She said the sterilization process noted by
the FDA is performed by a subcontractor and that new procedures
have been put in place since the inspection.  “We’ve been working with the FDA since the summer,” she
said.  Smith & Nephew has not yet received the warning letter by
mail, according to Hewitt. The company has 15 days to respond
once it receives it, according to the FDA statement. The FDA
said it will conduct a follow-up inspection to make sure changes
have been made at the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
