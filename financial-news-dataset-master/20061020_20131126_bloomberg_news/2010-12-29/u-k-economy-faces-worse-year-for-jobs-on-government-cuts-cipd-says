U.K. unemployment will rise in 2011
in what will be a “worse” year for hiring as the government
cuts public jobs as part of plans to reduce the  budget deficit ,
the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said.  Payrolls will drop by 200,000 next year, with public-sector
employment falling by 120,000 and private-sector jobs by 80,000,
the London-based  group  said in a report today. Unemployment may
rise to 9 percent, it said. Consumers’ spending power will also
be eroded, with the CIPD forecasting below-inflation pay
increases of 2 percent in 2011.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s plans to lower the budget
gap will cost the economy about 330,000 government jobs by 2015,
according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. Still, the
watchdog has said the loss will be more than offset by the
creation of about 1.5 million private-sector jobs.  “It will be a ‘fingers crossed’ year for the economy,”
CIPD Chief Economic Adviser  John Philpott  said in the report.
“This doesn’t mean that we are facing a return to the dire
recession days of late 2008 and 2009, but nonetheless 2011 will
probably feel like another year in the economic doldrums, rather
than the start of a return to prosperity.”  While  jobless claims  fell for a second month in November,
according to a Dec. 15 report, the decline was less economists
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. In the quarter through
October, unemployment measured by International Labour
Organization methods rose by 35,000 to 2.5 million people and
the  jobless rate  increased to 7.9 percent.  Also in November, inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 3.3
percent, the fastest in six months. The Bank of England
forecasts that annual consumer-price growth will remain above
its 2 percent target through 2011.  “Most workers will feel a squeeze in their real living
standards, with pay rises still relatively modest against a
backdrop of higher prices,” Philpott said. It will be a “jobs
light-pay tight” year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
