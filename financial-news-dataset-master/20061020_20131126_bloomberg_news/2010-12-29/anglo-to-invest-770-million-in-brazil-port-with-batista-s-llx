Anglo American Plc , the world’s
fifth-largest base-metals producer by market value, agreed to
invest as much as 1.3 billion reais ($770 million) in its iron-
ore port project with billionaire  Eike Batista ’s  LLX Logistica
SA  to export the mineral from Brazil.  Under a revised 25-year agreement, Anglo will pay $7.10 for
each metric ton of iron ore shipped from the Porto Acu joint
venture, LLX said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The accord
will generate $190 million of annual revenue for LLX, according
to the filing. London-based Anglo owns 49 percent of the port.  Anglo, suffering delays and cost overruns at its Minas Rio
development in Brazil, is spending about $17 billion to expand
production of copper, iron ore, nickel and other metals as
demand from Asian nations grows. The Minas Rio iron-ore complex,
its biggest project, includes a mine, a processing plant and a
326-mile (525-kilometer) pipeline that will transport the
mineral to Porto Acu.  The company secured a key license from Brazil this month
allowing it to progress with building Minas Rio after delays in
getting permits and design changes increased costs. It said in
July the cost of the development may rise by about a fifth to
$4.6 billion because of the delays.  Anglo said Dec. 10 that it will start work on the project
in March and deliver its first ore 27 to 30 months after that.
It had initially planned to start mining this year.  Anglo  rose 1.7 percent to 3,364 pence in London trading at
11 a.m. Before today, it climbed 22 percent this year, less than
a 28 percent rally in the FTSE All-Share Mining Index.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
