Bon Jovi , the New Jersey rock band
known for the song “Livin’ on a Prayer,” had the top-selling
2010 concert tour, beating AC/DC and U2, according to Pollstar.  The tour, promoted by Anschutz Entertainment Group,
garnered $201.1 million from 80 concerts worldwide, Fresno,
California-based  Pollstar  said today on its website. AC/DC
collected $177 million in 40 shows, and U2 took in $160.9 million in 32
appearances, the researcher said.  Sales for the top 50 tours worldwide dropped 12 percent
amid economic weakness including in the U.S., where growth has
been too slow to rein in  unemployment .  Live Nation Entertainment
Inc ., the world’s biggest concert organizer, discounted tickets
and canceled shows. Chief Executive Officer  Michael Rapino  told
analysts in November that the company next year will cut prices,
reduce show costs and organize fewer concerts with low margins.  The top 50 tours worldwide combined for $2.93 billion, down
from $3.34 billion in 2009 sales, Pollstar  said . Tours sold 38.3
million tickets worldwide, 7 percent less than the 45.3 million
from the year before. Total shows fell 8 percent to 2,650.  Pop singer Lady Gaga, whose given name is  Stefani Joanne Germanotta , claimed the fourth-biggest selling tour with
$133.6 million in worldwide sales. Rock band Metallica ranked
fifth with $110.1 million, Pollstar said.  Live Nation, based in Beverly Hills, California, fell
6 cents to $11.92 at 3:30 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange

before today. Closely held Anschutz Entertainment is based in
