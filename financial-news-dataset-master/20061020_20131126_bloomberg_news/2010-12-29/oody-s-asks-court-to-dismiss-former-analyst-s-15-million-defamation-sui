Moody’s Corp.  asked a court to
dismiss a $15 million defamation lawsuit filed by  Eric Kolchinsky , a former employee who claims the firm damaged his
professional reputation.  “Plaintiff’s defamation claim is rife with deficiencies
that require dismissal of the claim as a matter of law,”
Moody’s argued in a filing in federal court in Manhattan.  Kolchinsky, the former head of the structured-products
group at Moody’s that rated collateralized debt obligations,
claimed publicly that Moody’s failed to properly rate the
securities, which collapsed in value with the spike in home
mortgage defaults in 2008.  Kolchinsky claimed in the suit filed in September that
Moody’s then launched a “carefully planned retaliatory media
campaign” to damage his reputation. He sued Moody’s, its
Moody’s Investors Service unit and Moody’s chief executive
officer  Raymond McDaniel .  “We think we are on solid ground and did what we could to
avoid this unnecessary motion,” Kolchinsky’s lawyer,  Jenice Malecki , said in a phone interview today.  In its court papers filed today, Moody’s and Moody’s
Investors Service said that Kolchinsky has no legal basis to
sue. McDaniel filed a separate request to dismiss the claims.  The case is Kolchinsky v. Moody’s Corp., 10-cv-6840, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
