Tanzanian police arrested at least
four people and fired shots in the air yesterday to disperse a
demonstration by opposition-party supporters demanding a new
national constitution, the  Daily News  reported.  The gathering took place as the Civic United Front party
presented its proposals on a new charter to Justice and
Constitutional Affairs Permanent Secretary Oliver Mhaiki, the
Dar es Salaam-based newspaper said today.  The opposition wants the constitution changed because the
current document provides too much power to the president, the
newspaper said, citing Julius Mtatiro, acting deputy secretary-
general of the CUF.  In August, neighboring Kenya enacted a new constitution
that aims to place checks on the power of the president, spread
power among the East African nation’s 42 ethnic groups and
distribute land more equitably.  To contact the reporter on this story:
