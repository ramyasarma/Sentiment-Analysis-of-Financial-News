Serbia sold its debut 21-billion
dinar issue of six-month euro-indexed Treasury bills at an
average yield of 5.25 percent, the Debt Management Agency said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Demand for the securities was 31.9 billion dinar, it said.
The government will pay investors an exchange-rate differential
between the settlement date of Dec. 31, 2010, and the maturity
of July 1, 2011, on top of the yield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
