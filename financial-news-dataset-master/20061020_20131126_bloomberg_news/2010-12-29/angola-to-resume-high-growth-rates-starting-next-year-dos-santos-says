Angola, Africa’s second-biggest oil
producer, will return to “high” economic growth rates starting
next year after coming through the global financial crisis,
President  Jose Eduardo dos Santos  said.  Operational and institutional changes at the central bank
will help it to manage the economy and boost growth, Dos Santos
said in a speech broadcast on state-owned Luanda-based Radio
Nacional de Angola today.  “We managed to overcome the consequences of the global
economic and financial crisis of 2009,” he said. “Next year
our national economy will resume its high growth indexes.”  While oil revenues helped Angola’s economy expand more than
10 percent a year from 2004 to 2008, a global decline and a drop
in crude prices reduced growth to 0.7 percent last year,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  The economy is estimated to expand 7.6 percent in 2011,
Finance Minister Carlos Alberto Lopes said on Nov. 18. It
probably grew 4 percent this year, National Bank of Angola
Governor  Jose Lima Massano  said yesterday. The country is
rebuilding after a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002.  The government has strengthened the supervision and
operational policies of the central bank, helping it to bring
down inflation and encourage investment through lower interest
rates, Dos Santos said.  The central bank has started a process that will lead to
lower interest rates next year, Economy Minister  Abraao Gourgel 
said on Oct. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
