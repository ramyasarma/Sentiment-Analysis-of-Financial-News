The Miami Heat won for the 15th time
in their last 16 games, defeating the New York Knicks 106-98 as
 Dwyane Wade  scored a season-high 40 points and  LeBron James 
added 18 points and 10 rebounds.  The Heat, whose only National Basketball Association loss
in December came last week against the Dallas Mavericks,
outrebounded the Knicks 50-32 last night at American Airlines
Arena in Miami.  James scored the last five points of an 11-0 run in the
first quarter that gave the Heat (24-9) an early lead that
reached 19 points in the opening period.  The Heat led by 13 points at halftime. The Knicks pulled
within three points with two minutes left in the game before
Wade and James helped Miami pull away again.  Amar’e Stoudemire  had 30 points to lead the Knicks (18-13).  To contact the reporter on this story:
