Sudanese President  Umar al-Bashir 
will serve the remainder of his five-year term, regardless of
the outcome of a Jan. 9 independence referendum in Southern
Sudan, the state-run  Sudan News Agency  reported.  Sudan’s parliament will also complete its five-year term,
while seats occupied by Southern Sudanese officials will be
considered empty if the region chooses to secede, the Khartoum-
based news agency said, citing Information Minister Kemal Ebeid.  Al-Bashir retained office as president in April in the
country’s first multiparty elections in 24 years. The 66-year-
old leader seized power in a 1989 coup. His ruling National
Congress Party won the majority of northern Sudanese seats in
the National Assembly in the vote, which international observers
including the European Union said didn’t meet international
standards.  Next month’s plebiscite is the centrepiece of a 2005 peace
agreement that ended a 21-year civil war between Sudan’s north
and the oil-producing south. About 2 million people died in the
conflict and 4 million fled their homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
