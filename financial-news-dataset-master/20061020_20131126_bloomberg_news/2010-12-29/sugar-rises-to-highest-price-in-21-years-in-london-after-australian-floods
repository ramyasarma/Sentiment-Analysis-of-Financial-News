Sugar declined from a 30-year high
on concern that higher prices may lessen demand for the
sweetener. Coffee gained, while cocoa was unchanged.  Sugar consumption is down because of higher prices, while
sales of artificial sweeteners have been rising,  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge USA, said
yesterday in a report.  “The market weakened because of lack of buying,” said
 Jeff Bauml , a senior vice president at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, a broker in New York.  Raw sugar for March delivery declined 0.56 cent, or 1.6

cents, the highest for a most-active contract since November

Minnesota.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery rose
