Russian billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s holding company  AFK Sistema  unveiled the
country’s first smart phone equipped with the Glonass navigation
chip as the government seeks to challenge U.S. control of
satellite navigation.  Devices with chips developed by Sistema and state-run
Russian Nanotechnologies Corp. will go on sale for 10,990 rubles
($360) next March, Yevtushenkov said in a televised briefing
with Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  late yesterday.  “We should start selling it by March 8 as a present for
women so they can always identify on the map where their
husbands are,” Putin said.  Glonass is a Soviet-era project that stalled after funding
collapsed along with communism in 1991. The government this year
earmarked 27.9 billion rubles for the project, which faced a
setback earlier this month when a Proton-M rocket that aimed to
deliver three Glonass navigation satellites into orbit fell into
the Pacific Ocean.  Russia plans to require cellphone producers such as  Nokia
OYJ  to provide handsets compliant with Glonass for use
domestically, Yevtushenkov said in July. Widespread use of
Glonass-enabled equipment will start in 2011, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
