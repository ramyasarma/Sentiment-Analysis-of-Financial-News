A new storm soaking Southern
California may drop more than an inch of rain on already-sodden
hillsides following record storms last week.  The new system is forecast to dump a half-inch to 1 1/4
inches on Los Angeles by tomorrow morning, according to Stuart
Seto, weather specialist at the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration . That would bring December rainfall for downtown
to about 10 inches, more than four times normal, he said.  Rock slides closed a section of Pacific Coast Highway in
Malibu, while in Redondo Beach, southwest of Los Angeles, some
streets were closed due to flooding, Seto said in an interview.
Area airports were experiencing arrival and departure delays of
15 minutes or less, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration  website .  Some residents were still coping with the effects of the
last series of storms, including loss of phone service.  “Torrential rains have flooded some of our facilities,”
Beth Gautier, spokeswoman for  AT&T Inc. , said yesterday in an e-
mail.  Colder temperatures and “very strong winds” will cause
snow levels in the mountains north of Los Angeles to drop to an
elevation of 2,500 feet by late afternoon and evening, according
to Seto.  California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  last week
declared a state of emergency in six counties in the face of
flooding rains.  To contact the reporter on this story
