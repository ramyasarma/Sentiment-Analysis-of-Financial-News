South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  gained 0.4 percent to 32,123.40 at the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg, snapping two days of losses, taking the year’s
gain to 16 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, increased for the first time in four days, rising 5.51
rand, or 1.6 percent, to 346.50 rand. Anglo American agreed to
invest as much as 1.3 billion reais ($770 million) in its iron-
ore port project with billionaire Eike Batista’s LLX Logistica
SA to export the mineral from Brazil.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), the world’s third-biggest
producer of the precious metal, climbed 1.5 percent, to 330.40
rand. Gold advanced this year as investors lost confidence in
currencies and bought precious metals to protect wealth. The
metal rallied 0.4 percent.  Gold Fields Ltd.  (GFI SJ), Africa’s
second-largest producer, rose for the second day in three,
adding 0.6 percent to 119.97 rand.  -- With assistance from Nicky Smith in Johannesburg. Editors:
