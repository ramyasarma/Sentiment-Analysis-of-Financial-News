Joe Webb  passed for 195 yards and
ran nine yards for a touchdown in his first National Football
League start and the Minnesota Vikings defeated the host
Philadelphia Eagles 24-14 in a game delayed two days by the East
Coast snowstorm.  Webb replaced the injured  Brett Favre , who sustained a
concussion last week against the Chicago Bears.  “My teammates were all around me,” Webb said in a
televised interview last night. “You always have to have
composure as a quarterback.”  Antoine Winfield , who recorded two sacks, returned a fumble
45 yards for a score with less than a minute left in the first
half to even the score at 7-7 after Philadelphia’s  Clay Harbor 
scored in the first quarter on a 3-yard pass from  Michael Vick .  The Vikings (6-9) took command in the second half.  Ryan Longwell  kicked a 30-yard field goal and Webb scored to give the
visitors a 17-7 lead after three quarters.  Vick, who before the game was announced as the Pro Bowl
starting quarterback for the National Football Conference,
scored on a 10-yard run to narrow the gap to 17-14 in the fourth
quarter before  Adrian Peterson  added a touchdown for the Vikings
on a 1-yard run.  Vick passed for 263 yards, with one touchdown and one
interception, for the Eagles (10-5), who already have clinched a
playoff spot. The game originally was scheduled as a Sunday
night contest.  “It’s been a long week,” Winfield said. “Coach (Leslie)
Frazier did a great job of keeping us focused.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
