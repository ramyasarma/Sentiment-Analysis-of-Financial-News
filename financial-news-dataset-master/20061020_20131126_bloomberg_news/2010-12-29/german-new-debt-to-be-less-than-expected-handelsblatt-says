     Dec. 29 (Bloomberg) --Germany’s new debt will be just under
48 billion euros ($63 billion) in 2010, which is less than the
government expected, economist  Alfred Boss  of the Kiel-based  IfW 
institute told Handelsblatt in an  interview  published today.  The government previously estimated new debt would be just
under 50 billion euros, the newspaper said. New debt will
decline in the next two years, to about 44.3 billion euros in
2011 and 36.8 billion euros in 2012, Boss said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
