The Swiss franc appreciated against
the dollar, trading near a record, after a report signaled
economic growth will carry into next year.  The monthly gauge that aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead slipped to 2.10 in December
from a revised 2.13 the month earlier, the KOF research
institute in Zurich said in an e-mailed statement today. That
was in line with the median forecast of seven economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The indicator remains “at a high
level,” KOF said in its statement.  “The Swiss economy, despite the strength in the Swiss
franc, is still in a robust recovery phase,” said  Ursina Kubli ,
a currency analyst at Bank Sarasin & Cie in Zurich. “Maybe in
2011 we can expect some cooling but at the moment it is still
robust.”  The Swiss currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 94.96
centimes per dollar as of 5 p.m. in London, after appreciating
to 94.47 centimes per dollar. It reached a record 94.35 centimes
per greenback yesterday. The franc was 0.3 percent weaker at
1.2525 per euro, from 1.2489 yesterday. It reached an all-time
high of 1.2439 per euro on Dec. 22.  Switzerland’s currency has gained 9 percent against the
dollar this year and 18 percent against its 16-nation
counterpart as investors used the franc as a haven from the
crisis that has roiled the euro area. The single currency
weakened against all but one of its 16 major peers in 2010.  “We expect the Swiss franc will remain strong, especially
in the first half of 2011 because the euro crisis is likely to
prevail,” Kubli said. “Portugal will have difficulty
refinancing itself so the euro crisis could escalate again, when
Portugal needs fiscal help.”  Portugal, which is struggling to curb the euro region’s
fourth-largest budget deficit, plans to sell as much as
20 billion euros ($26 billion) in bonds next year, the country’s
debt agency said today in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
