as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Gunvor International BV sold lots
to BP Plc.  Gasoil futures declined. The fuel’s crack, a measure of
refining profitability, widened.  Light Products  Gasoline  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp, Europe’s oil-trading hub, traded at $831 and $831.50 a
metric ton, according to a broker monitoring deals on the Argus

$842 a ton.  BP bought 4,000 tons of the 5,000 tons that changed hands.

make automotive fuel.  Gasoline’s crack , or premium to Brent crude, narrowed to $6
a barrel from $6.35 on Dec. 24, according to PVM Oil Associates
