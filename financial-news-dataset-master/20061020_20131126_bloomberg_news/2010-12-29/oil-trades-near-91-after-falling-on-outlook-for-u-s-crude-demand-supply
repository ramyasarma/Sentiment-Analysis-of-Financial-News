Crude traded near a 26-month high in
New York on speculation the U.S. Energy Department will report a
drop in weekly stockpiles, signaling demand is growing in the
world’s biggest oil-consuming nation.  Oil traded above $91 a barrel for a fifth day as a
Bloomberg News survey showed inventories probably fell for a
fourth week, extending the longest decline in a year. Futures
dropped yesterday after the industry-funded American Petroleum
Institute said supplies rose 3.06 million barrels, or 0.9
percent, to 345.1 million.  “It’s possible for the market to rise from the beginning
of next year, but for now, crude oil will be steady, slightly
above $90,” said Ken Hasegawa, a Tokyo-based commodity
derivatives sales manager at Newedge, a brokerage. “There’s a
lot of inventory, therefore it’s not easy to go higher.”  Crude for February delivery was at $91.33 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 21
cents, at 3:10 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, it lost 37 cents
to $91.12. The contract traded at $91.88 on Dec. 27, the highest
since Oct. 7, 2008. Futures have gained 15 percent this year.  U.S. oil inventories probably fell 2.85 million barrels in
the week ended Dec. 24, based on the median estimate from 14
analysts polled by Bloomberg News. Stockpiles decreased in the
previous three weeks to 340.7 million, 6.8 percent above the
five-year average, according to the Energy Department.  The department will release its Weekly Petroleum Status
Report at 11 a.m. in Washington today, a day later than usual
because of the Christmas holiday.  Third-Worst Performer  Oil, which rallied 78 percent in 2009, is the third-worst
performer this year among 22 commodities tracked by Bloomberg,
as rising supplies countered optimism fuel consumption is
recovering. Natural gas and cocoa are the worst performers.  Gasoline stockpiles probably rose 1.5 million barrels from
217.2 million, the Bloomberg News survey showed. Distillate fuel
inventories, including heating oil and diesel, are expected to
have slipped 625,000 barrels from 160.7 million.  U.S. gasoline demand at the pump climbed 4.6 percent last
week, according to MasterCard Inc. Motorists bought an average
9.613 million barrels a day in the week to Dec. 24, the second-
largest payments network company said in its SpendingPulse
report Dec. 28.  Brent crude for February settlement traded at $94.32 a
barrel, up 18 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
