Fiat SpA  and unions reached a final
accord for a car plant in Pomigliano, Italy, clearing the way
for investments at the site that will produce Panda models,
labor officials said.  The Fismic, Fim, Uilm, Uglm and Associazione Quadri unions
signed agreements that will allow 5,600 employees to be hired in
January at the factory near Naples, Fismic said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “This shows that there are two types of labor unions, one
that carries out strikes and another that negotiates
agreements,” Roberto Di Maulo, head of the Fismic union, said
in the statement.  A Fiat spokeswoman said the company had no immediate
comment.  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  earlier this year
had proposed shifting production of its best-selling Panda model
from Poland to the under-utilized Pomigliano plant and invest
700 million euros ($920 million) in the factory if unions agree
to a plan that includes adding shifts and instituting a six-day
work week.  Today’s agreement follows an accord reached last week with
most of the unions at Fiat’s Mirafiori plant, the company’s
largest factory in Italy. The FIOM union didn’t sign the
Mirafiori agreement and plans to strike for eight hours on Jan.
