Portugal, struggling to cut the euro
region’s fourth-largest budget deficit, plans to sell as much as
20 billion euros ($26 billion) in bonds next year to help
finance the gap.  The country’s total borrowing needs are expected to be
about 20 billion euros, the debt agency, known as the IGCP, said
today in an e-mailed statement. The government plans to sell a
new bond through banks in the first quarter, it said.  Portugal is cutting state workers’ wages and has raised
taxes to show investors it can narrow the budget gap after the
Greek fiscal crisis led to a surge in borrowing costs for high-
deficit nations in the region. Ireland last month became the
second country to seek a bailout and the first to line up aid
from the European Financial Stability Facility.  The difference in yield between Portuguese 10-year bonds
and German bunds, Europe’s benchmark government security,
reached a record 484 basis points, or 4.84 percentage point, on
Nov. 11. The gap, or spread, was at 365 basis points as of 2:44
p.m. in New York. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “The financing needs for 2011 represent a significant
reduction relative to this year,”  Alberto Soares , chairman of
the government debt agency, said in a telephone interview.  Portugal said in March its financing needs for 2010 were
expected to be 24 billion euros to 25 billion euros and it
expected to sell up to 22 billion euros in bonds.  2010 Total  The government raised 21.4 billion euros in bonds this
year, including auctions and bonds sold through a syndicate of
banks, Soares said. Total financing amounted to around 23.7
billion euros, he said.  Portugal’s bond sale through banks will be for at least 3
billion euros, the IGCP said. It intends to sell more of four-
to-six securities through auctions in the first quarter, subject
to market conditions, the Lisbon-based agency added.  Net financing from treasury bills should be “marginally
positive in 2011,” it said.  Bond sales may total as little as 18 billion euros next
year, the debt agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
