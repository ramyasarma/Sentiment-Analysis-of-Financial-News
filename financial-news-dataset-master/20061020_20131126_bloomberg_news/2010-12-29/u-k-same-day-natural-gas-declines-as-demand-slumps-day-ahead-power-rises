U.K. natural gas for next-month
climbed to its highest level in almost two years as cold weather
depleted storage stocks amid the winter heating season.  Front-month gas rose as much as 2.2 pence, or 3.7 percent,
to 61 pence a therm. It was at 60.9 pence, or $9.40 a million
British thermal units, at 4:30 p.m. in London, the highest since
Jan. 30, 2009, according to broker data compiled Bloomberg. Gas
for immediate delivery was little changed at 60.5 pence a therm.  Rough , the country’s largest gas-storage facility, held
18,158 gigawatt-hours of the fuel as of yesterday, 43 percent
less than a year ago, according to National Grid Plc data.  Month-ahead gas has risen 81 percent this year as freezing
weather depleted underground gas stores, making Britain more
reliant on imports of liquefied natural gas to meet demand.  “The weather looks set to remain rather cold for much of
this period, with overnight frosts quite likely,” the U.K. Met
Office said of conditions from Jan. 12 through Jan. 26.  Ten LNG tankers are sailing to the U.K., according to ship-
tracking and port data. Sub-zero temperatures have also eroded
LNG  storage levels  at import terminals.  About half of Britain’s power stations use natural gas and
the price influences electricity markets. U.K. baseload power
for tomorrow rose as much as 1 pound to 50.25 pounds ($77.30) a
megawatt-hour. It was unchanged as of 4:30 p.m. in London.  The next-working day contract traded at 49.25 pounds on
Dec. 23. National Grid predicted energy use today to peak at
51,444 megawatts, 3.6 percent higher than yesterday.  Front month power rose 65 pence, or 1.3 percent, to 52.85
pounds a megawatt-hour.  London temperatures may rise to 7 degrees Celsius (45
Fahrenheit) today from a high of 2 degrees on Dec. 24, according
to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
