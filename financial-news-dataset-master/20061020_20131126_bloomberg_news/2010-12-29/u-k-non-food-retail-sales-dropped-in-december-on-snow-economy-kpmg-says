U.K. non-food  retail sales  fell this
month as economic uncertainty and cold weather deterred Britons
from holiday shopping, KPMG LLP said, citing anecdotal evidence.  “There’s no doubt that non-food trading in the four weeks
to Christmas saw a drop in like-for-like sales, with many
retailers having a difficult time,” KPMG partners including
 Helen Dickinson , head of retail in the U.K., said in an e-mailed
statement from London today. While “post-Christmas sales are
now crucial to December’s results,” it is “likely that the
sales season will quickly run out of steam.”  ‪“The industry knows it is in for a tough year,” KPMG
said. “Customers are tightening their belts because they’re
worried about prospects for their own jobs and personal finances
in what are likely to be tougher economic conditions in 2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
