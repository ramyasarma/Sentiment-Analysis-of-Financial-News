Anger mounted among passengers
stranded on airport tarmacs and in terminals as  flight delays 
threatened to stretch into the weekend following the worst
December snowstorm to hit New York City in six decades.  As many as 1.2 million airline customers may have been
affected by almost 8,200 flight cancellations as the storm that
hit three days ago closed major airports. Passengers were forced
to try to make new plans, sometimes without being able to reach
airlines by phone or online for help.  “There’s a haphazard strategy to how airlines address
these issues,” said Brandon Macsata, executive director of the
 Association for Airline Passenger Rights . “That’s why
passengers get so angry. It’s not about the weather. It’s about
how airlines communicate after weather occurs.”  The disruptions affected the nation’s largest and most-
congested air travel market during one of the busiest times of
the year. With planes already flying at their fullest since
World War II, carriers were struggling to find empty seats to
rebook travelers.  At least 307 flights have been canceled today, down from
thousands in each of the past three days, spokesmen for the
airlines said.  JetBlue Airways Corp.  canceled 120 flights today
and said its backlog of stranded passengers may not be fully
cleared until Jan. 1.  Reservation Agents  Continental Airlines also canceled 120 flights today,
primarily those operated by regional partners at its Newark
Liberty airport hub, said  Christen David , a spokeswoman for the
carrier.  Delays averaged 70 minutes at New York’s Kennedy airport
today and a half-hour at Newark’s Liberty, according to  the
Federal Aviation Administration .  Nancy Graves  spent three days trying to reach Continental
Airlines reservations agents by phone to get her daughter
rebooked after a Dec. 26 flight from Newark was canceled.  The Westfield, New Jersey, resident had no luck using the
airline’s  website  because it added a change fee that was
supposed to be waived and an additional amount for the fare.  “Where’s the CEO?” Graves said in an interview today.
“Why isn’t he out here saying, ‘You know, we realize that we’ve
impacted all these folks and our phones are not working and our
Internet access is down, and we are going to get it fixed. We
are going to work all night; we’re going to get it fixed.’ Show
some leadership.”  Tarmac Fines  The U.S. Transportation Department is looking into details
of the New York flight delays and will review other cases,
 Olivia Alair , an agency spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
Transportation Secretary  Ray LaHood  was being updated on the
crisis.  LaHood, who helped push through a regulation allowing
domestic carriers to be fined for tarmac delays of more than
three hours, made no public comments. International airlines
aren’t covered by the rule.  “What can airlines do better?” asked  Michael Boyd ,
president of aviation consultant  Boyd Group International Inc. 
in Evergreen, Colorado. “They’re doing everything they can. If
you weren’t going to or from the East Coast, it didn’t affect
you.”  Most of the passenger backlog will be cleared by tonight,
Boyd predicted.  The  Port Authority of New York  and New Jersey, which
operates Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports, faulted
some airlines after at least six international flights were
stuck on the tarmac at Kennedy with passengers aboard because
they had no gates to use.  Place to Dock  “It is an airline’s responsibility to make sure before
they leave their point of origin to make sure that they have a
gate assignment,” said  Steve Coleman , a Port Authority
spokesman. “These airlines did not. So they got to the airport
and had no place to dock.”  Passengers on a  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.  flight were
stuck on the tarmac at  Kennedy  for almost 12 hours yesterday as
they waited for a gate. Four other flights operated by the
carrier were also stranded for more than four hours, Cathay said
in a statement today, apologizing for delays. More than 1,100
people were onboard the five flights, the carrier said.  A spokesman for the Hong Kong-based airline said the
flights were dispatched under the belief that gates would be
available.  Upon arrival, “there were no gates available and our
options were limited,” said the spokesman,  Gus Whitcomb .
“Unfortunately, we ended up with passengers on airplanes for
far too long before we were able to get them to the gates.”  ‘Little Planes’  Staff with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
spent the morning seeking gates where the planes could dock,
even though that isn’t the agency’s responsibility, said
Coleman, the agency’s spokesman.  Sara Schaefer , a 27-year-old psychology student from
Munich, said she arrived at Kennedy yesterday to find her
American Eagle commuter flight to Norfolk, Virginia, wouldn’t be
taking off because three of the four runways were closed and
“little planes” were canceled.  “I called the airline and they said it’s Mother Earth and
out of our control,” said Schaefer, who traveled to the U.S.
with her fiance on Christmas Day. She returned to Manhattan last
night to catch a bus slated to arrive in Norfolk at 6 a.m.
today.  Call-Center Waits  Other passengers complained about spending 90 minutes on
hold before reaching reservations agents, or not being able to
get an answer at all.  AMR Corp. ’s American and  US Airways  added
agents to field calls or put workers on mandatory overtime.  American Airlines, the third-biggest U.S. carrier, said
operations were almost normal today at the three large New York-
area airports. The carrier canceled two flights into Kennedy
airport today, and its Eagle commuter line has canceled 51, said
Ed Martelle, a spokesman.  “It’s looking brighter,” he said in an interview. Ice on
the ground in ramp and gate areas remains a problem at
LaGuardia, Martelle said.  US Airways Group Inc.  has canceled three flights today,
spokesman  Todd Lehmacher  said in an e-mail. The carrier added
extra flights on a few routes out of Boston and a Philadelphia-
to-Phoenix flight, Lehmacher said.  Delta Air Lines Inc. canceled seven flights and said it
would add one extra Boeing 777 flight tomorrow from Kennedy to
Atlanta. Continental added 12 flights to help clear backlogs,
David said.  Subways, Buses  “We really aren’t experiencing a huge backlog in any one
particular area,” Lehmacher said. “We anticipate that the
small backlog that exists will be resolved by the end of the day
today.”  Carriers had struggled once the snow stopped on Dec. 27 to
relocate aircraft and crews while factoring in airport employees
unable to travel to work after New York’s heaviest December
snowfall  since 1948  hampered local train service.  Snowdrifts continue to keep the subway’s N line out of
service in Brooklyn, along with the Franklin Avenue shuttle,
said  Deirdre Parker , a Metropolitan Transportation Authority
spokeswoman. The Q and B lines began running this morning and
remaining lines are running on almost normal schedules, she
said.  Some bus routes still aren’t operating, and Parker advised
residents of Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens to check the
MTA’s website before traveling.  ‘Better Service Passengers’  By pre-canceling flights ahead of the storm, airlines were
able to avoid stranding planes and crews in shuttered airports,
which kept cancellations from rippling through the rest of their
route systems, said  David Castelveter,  a spokesman for the Air
Transport Association, which represents major U.S. carriers.  “I am confident the airlines will look at the processes
they had in place during this storm and they will determine if
changes need to be made to improve and better serve
passengers,”  Debby McElroy , executive vice president for
Airports Council International-North America, said in an
interview. “They may decide there really isn’t anything else
they can do.”  Airlines have culled airplanes from their fleets and cut
capacity during the past two years to reduce costs and better
match supply to demand that collapsed during the recession. As a
result, carriers have few spare planes to put into service. The
volume of holiday travel poses an additional obstacle.  Full Planes  “Many flights during the holidays are at 100 percent load
factor,”  David Swierenga , president of aviation consultant
AeroEcon in Round Rock, Texas, said of the average number of
occupied seats. “This means the airlines’ ability to
accommodate travelers from canceled flights is greatly
diminished.”  Swierenga estimated the largest U.S. airlines, which may
have combined profits of more than $3 billion this year, will
suffer a revenue loss of about $150 million from the storm.
That’s based on an assumed average round-trip fare of $300 and
150 passengers per plane, with about half of affected passengers
rebooking flights, he said.  Saul Tejada, a limousine driver, was waiting at 8:30 p.m.
for an airline passenger who had been stuck on the tarmac since
about 2:30 p.m.  “Every plane seems to be awaiting a gate,” he said. “I
don’t know if they’re low on manpower or what, but this is
ridiculous.”  “It’s rough, but if we tell them we’re going to be here,
we’re going to be here,” he said. Fifteen minutes later, Tejada
received a text message from the passenger saying that she was
about to get off her plane.  To contact the reporters on this story:
