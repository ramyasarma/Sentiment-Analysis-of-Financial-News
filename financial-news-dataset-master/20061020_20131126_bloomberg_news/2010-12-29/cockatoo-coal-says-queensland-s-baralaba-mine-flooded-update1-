Cockatoo Coal Ltd. , an Australian
coal producer, said production was halted at its Baralaba mine
in Queensland state after severe weather conditions caused the
pit to flood.  “Whilst the full extent of the impact of the flood on the
mine open pit is yet to be determined, once flood waters recede
a detailed pit dewatering program will be initiated to get
the mine back into production as soon as possible,” Sydney-
based Cockatoo said today in a statement.  Australia had its wettest September-to-November period on
record, prompting mining companies including Rio Tinto Group,
Xstrata Plc and Vale SA to declare force majeure. Force majeure
is a legal clause that allows a company to miss deliveries
because of circumstances beyond its control.  Xstrata today said operations at its Oaky Creek underground
mine in the Bowen Basin in Queensland were affected by
disruption to rail lines. The company is assessing the level of
delays to shipments from Oaky Creek, Xstrata Coal Spokesman
 James Rickards  said.  “Open pits are in recovery mode and we will assess the
impact over the next days,” Rickards said in an e-mailed
statement. “Our underground operations, including Oaky Creek
Coal, are still expected to perform at either industry leading
or record levels this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
