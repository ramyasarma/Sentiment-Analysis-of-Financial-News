Kenyan exports to Uganda, Tanzania
and Rwanda in the first nine months of this year grew 9.6
percent, a slower rate of increase than before rules were
introduced to boost regional trade,  Business Daily  reported.  Shipments climbed to 61.6 billion shillings ($764.3
million) in the period through September, from 56.2 billion
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based newspaper said,
citing data from Kenya’s East African Community Ministry.  Regulations on cross-border movements of people, goods and
services were relaxed in July to promote trade between countries
in the five-nation East African Community that groups Kenya,
Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.  Trade growth was 9.7 percent between 2008 and 2009, and 22
percent between 2007 and 2008, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
