OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel dropped plans
to buy a 25 percent stake in the company from  Oleg Deripaska ’s
 United Co. Rusal , the same day that Interfax reported it
rejected an offer for its power unit from the billionaire.  Norilsk  failed to reach an accord with Rusal to buy the
aluminum maker’s 25 percent stake, the Moscow-based maker of
nickel, copper and palladium said yesterday in an e-mail.  The company’s board also rejected a $2.1 billion cash offer
from Deripaska’s OAO EuroSibEnergo for its 79 percent stake in
power unit OAO OGK-3, deciding instead to swap it for shares in
state-run utility OAO Inter RAO UES, Interfax reported, citing
an unidentified Norilsk director and an unnamed Rusal official.  Deripaska’s battle for control of Norilsk against rival
shareholder  Vladimir Potanin  is set to extend into 2011, marking
at least four years of ownership conflicts at the world’s
biggest nickel miner. Norilsk management said Dec. 27 that it is
ready to offer a buyback to all shareholders should Rusal
rejects its bid of at least $12 billion for its stake in Norilsk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
