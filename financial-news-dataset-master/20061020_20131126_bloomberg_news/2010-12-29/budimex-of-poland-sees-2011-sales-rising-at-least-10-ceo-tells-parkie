Budimex SA, Poland’s second largest
construction company, forecasts that 2011 sales will grow by at
least 10 percent, Chief Executive Officer Dariusz Blocher told
Parkiet in an interview.  The forecast will depend largely on how winter weather
affects some projects, Blocher said, according to the newspaper,
adding that the net margin may narrow from the 6.6 percent
achieved in the first three quarters of this year.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
