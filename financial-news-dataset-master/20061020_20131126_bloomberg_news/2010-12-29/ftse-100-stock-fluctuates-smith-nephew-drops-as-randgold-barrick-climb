The U.K.’s benchmark  FTSE 100 Index 
was little changed as trading resumed in London following the
four-day Christmas break.  Smith & Nephew Plc lost 2 percent after U.S. regulators
said the maker of implants violated manufacturing and testing
rules. Randgold Resources Ltd. and African Barrick Gold Plc rose
with metals prices.  The FTSE 100 increased 1.29, or less than 0.1 percent, to
6,010.21 at 8:35 a.m. in London. The  FTSE All-Share  rose 0.1
percent, as did Ireland’s  ISEQ Index .  The FTSE 100 last week ended above 6,000 for the first time
since June 2008, heading for a 2010 rally of 11 percent and its
best December since 1993. Investors worldwide have poured money
into equities this year as companies reported profits that
exceeded analysts’ estimates and the U.S. Federal Reserve buys
bonds to stimulate economic growth.  Smith & Nephew declined 2 percent to 672 pence. Europe’s
largest maker of shoulder and knee implants got a warning letter
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration saying the company
failed to properly manufacture, store and test some medical
devices.  Randgold Resources  rose 3.6 percent to 5,455 pence, leading
gains in the FTSE 100. African Barrick climbed 1.7 percent to
592 pence.  Gold yesterday rose the most in seven weeks on speculation
that Europe’s debt crisis will spread, boosting demand for the
precious metal as a haven asset. Silver closed at the highest
settlement price in 30 years.  Copper jumped to a record on the London Metal Exchange,
catching up with gains in other metals markets as trading
resumed today after a two-day holiday. Aluminum, zinc and lead
also climbed.  British Airways Plc , the U.K.’s largest airline, fell 1.2
percent to 272.5 pence. As many as 1.2 million airline customers
may have been affected by almost 8,000 flight cancellations
after the snowstorm that hit the U.S. three days ago closed
major airports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
