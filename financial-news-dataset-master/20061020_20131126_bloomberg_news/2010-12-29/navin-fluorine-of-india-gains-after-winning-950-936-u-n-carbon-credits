Navin Fluorine International Ltd. , a
Indian maker of industrial gases used in refrigerators, rose
after it was awarded an additional 950,936 carbon credits by the
United Nations.  The  shares  gained as much as 7.5 percent to 292 rupees and
traded at 281.7 rupees, up 3.7 percent, as of 11:18 a.m. local
time. The benchmark  Sensitive Index  advanced 0.4 percent.  Such credits are bought by companies and nations to comply
with limits on their emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for
global warming. The price of one credit, known as a UN Certified
Emission Reduction, for delivery in December 2011 closed at
11.23 euros ($14.74) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
Exchange in London yesterday.  The United Nations Clean Development Mechanism awarded the
credits to Mumbai-based Navin Fluorine for a project that
reduces emissions of hydrofluorocarbon-23, or HFC-23, a by-
product of refrigerant production and potent greenhouse gas.  It was the first time the project was issued credits since
Dec. 3, 2009, according to Bloomberg data. The UN delayed
issuances of credits to 12 HFC-23 projects amid a review after
environmental group CDM Watch said some companies won “bogus”
credits by exploiting the system.  The European Union, home to the world’s biggest emissions
trading market and a major buyer of credits, has proposed a ban
on credits from HFC-23 projects starting in 2013. EU member
states may vote next month on the proposal,  Peter Zapfel , head
of policy coordination in the EU’s climate department, said Dec.
