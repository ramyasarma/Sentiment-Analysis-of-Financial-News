KT Corp. , South Korea’s largest

to a person familiar with the matter.  Seongnam, South Korea-based KT may sell the notes as early
as January, and is considering a maturity of two years, the
person said, asking not to be named before a final decision is
made.  The company is mulling a sale of Samurai bonds, though no
timing or size has been determined, and hired Citigroup Inc. and
Daiwa Securities Group Inc. to help manage the sale, said a
company official who asked not to be identified as the details
