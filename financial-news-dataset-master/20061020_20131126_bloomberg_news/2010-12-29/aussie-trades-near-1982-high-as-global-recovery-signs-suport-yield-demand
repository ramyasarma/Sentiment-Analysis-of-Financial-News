The Australian dollar traded near
the highest level since 1982 as signs the U.S. economic recovery
is gaining momentum spurred demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie held onto an eight-day gain against
the greenback, the longest rally since March 2009, before U.S.
reports today forecast to show initial jobless claims fell and
businesses expanded for a 15th month. The New Zealand dollar was
close to a five-week high after the MSCI World Index of stocks
recovered all its losses since the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. triggered a global financial crisis.  “There is growing optimism about the pace of the economic
recovery,” said  Toshihiko Sakai , trading head for currencies
and financial products in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust &
Banking Corp., a unit of Japan’s largest financial group by
market value. “Commodities and stocks are doing well. Excessive
liquidity is also finding its way into higher-yielding
currencies like Aussie and kiwi.”  Australia’s currency was at $1.0171 at 5:14 p.m. in Sydney
from $1.0179 in New York, after touching $1.0198, the highest
level since July 1982. The nation stopped pegging the Aussie to
a trade-weighted basket of currencies in December 1983.  The Aussie headed for a 14 percent gain this year against
its U.S. counterpart. It bought 82.83 yen from 83.04 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 76.84 U.S. cents from 76.86
cents in New York. It earlier reached 76.93 cents, the highest
since Nov. 23. It fetched 62.58 yen from 62.73 yen.  Stocks, U.S. Data  The  MSCI World Index  of shares in 24 developed nations rose
as much as 0.6 percent to 1,283.68 yesterday, topping its
closing level of 1,283.14 on Sept. 12, 2008, before Lehman’s
bankruptcy spurred a 46 percent slump through March 9, 2009.  First-time filings for U.S. jobless insurance fell to
415,000 in the week ended Dec. 25 from 420,000 in the previous
week, according to the median forecast of 26 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The Labor Department report is due today.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. will say
today its business barometer fell to 61.0 this month from 62.5
in November, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  No ‘Double-Dip’  “Concerns about a double-dip recession have waned,” said
 Takeru Ogihara , chief strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co.
in Tokyo, a unit of Japan’s second-largest bank. “Market
consensus is the global economy will continue to expand with the
U.S. seeing a recovery and emerging economies continuously
growing. That’s a factor to buy growth-related currencies.”  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  Demand for the South Pacific nations’ currencies was
limited as China’s manufacturing growth slowed for the first
time in five months in December after the government boosted
interest rates twice since October to tame inflation.  A  purchasing managers’ index  released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell to 54.4 from 55.3 in
November. The data are seasonally adjusted and a reading above
50 indicates an expansion. China is Australia’s largest trading
partner and New Zealand’s second-biggest export market.  China’s Tightening  “There is still some downside risk to commodity currencies
as China’s tightening is progressing behind the scenes,” said
 Toshiya Yamauchi , a senior analyst in Tokyo at Ueda Harlow Ltd.,
which provides foreign-exchange margin-trading services.
“Aussie buying seems a bit overheated while risk sentiment has
been improving.”  The 14-day relative strength index for the Australian
dollar against its U.S. counterpart was at 66.4 today, close to
the 70 level which some traders treat as an indication an
asset’s price has strengthened too far and is poised to fall.  Australian bond futures rose, with the 10-year contract for
March delivery at 94.375 on the Sydney Futures Exchange from
94.275 yesterday. The implied yield on the futures fell 10 basis
points to 5.625 percent.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, was unchanged at 3.80 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
