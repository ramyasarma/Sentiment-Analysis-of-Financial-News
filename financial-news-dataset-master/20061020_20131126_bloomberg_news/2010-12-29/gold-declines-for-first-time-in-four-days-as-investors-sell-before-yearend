Gold declined for the first time in
four days as some investors sold the metal before the end of the
year to take advantage of its rally to a two-week high. Silver
fell from a three-week high.  Immediate-delivery gold lost 0.2 percent to as low as
$1,402.47 an ounce and was at $1,404.50 at 12:21 p.m. in Tokyo.
The metal gained 1.6 percent yesterday, the biggest advance
since Dec. 3. Gold for February delivery on the Comex in New
York was little changed at $1,404.90 an ounce.  Bullion has risen 28 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7, as Europe’s debt crisis and low
U.S. interest rates spurred investment in precious metals. The
metal is heading for a 10th consecutive annual gain, the longest
winning streak in at least nine decades.  “It’s a knee-jerk reaction to yesterday’s rally and
position-squaring before the end of this year,”  Hwang Il Doo , a
senior trader at  Korea Exchange Bank  Futures Co. in Seoul, said
today by phone.  The Dollar  Index , which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the
euro, yen and pound, dropped as much as 0.2 percent.  Bullion’s decline would be limited as the dollar fell, said
 Hiroyuki Kikukawa , the general manager of research at IDO
Securities Co. in Tokyo. Gold typically moves inversely to the
U.S. currency.  ETP Holdings  Gold assets  held in exchange-traded products, or ETPs, fell
0.3987 metric tons to 2,100.523 tons yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a
record 2,114.6 tons on Dec. 20.  Silver holdings in ETPs declined 10.8848 tons to 15,062.40
tons yesterday, data from four providers show. Holdings reached
15,172 tons on Dec. 17, the highest level since at least
February.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.4 percent to $30.1838
an ounce after touching $30.3250 yesterday, the highest level
since Dec. 7, when it reached a 30-year high of $30.7025.  Palladium dropped for the first time in five days,
declining 0.2 percent to $786.00 an ounce. Platinum fell 0.4
percent to $1,750 an ounce after touching $1,760.75 yesterday,
the highest level since Nov. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
