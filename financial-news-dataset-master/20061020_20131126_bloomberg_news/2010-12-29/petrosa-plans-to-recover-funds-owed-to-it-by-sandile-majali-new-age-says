PetroSA, South Africa’s state-owned
oil company, plans to recover millions of rand owed to it by
Sandile Majali, the businessman who was found dead in his hotel
room in Johannesburg on Dec. 26, The New Age reported, citing
company spokesman, Thabo Mabaso.  Majali owed PetroSA 5 million rand from a 15 million-rand
payment the company made to Imvume Management for a crude oil
supply deal in 2004, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.
PetroSA may seek to recover the funds from Majali’s estate, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
