             China  cut jet fuel prices by 90  yuan 
($11.65) a ton starting April 1, to reflect earlier oil price
declines, according to domestic airlines including China Eastern
Airlines Corp.  
 ``It's a positive move for China's airlines,'' said  Luo Zhuping , company secretary of China Eastern, in a telephone
interview today, without elaborating on how much the company may
gain from the cost reduction.  
 China has cut jet fuel prices three times this year,
lowering costs for domestic airlines including China Eastern and
China Southern Airlines Co. It reduced the jet fuel price by 180
yuan on Jan. 1, followed by a decrease of 90 yuan on Jan. 14.  
 ``It's very likely that the government will lower fuel
surcharges as well,'' said Alan Lam, an analyst at Guotai Junan
Securities Co. in Hong Kong. ``That may erode the carriers' gains
from lower fuel costs, but not all.''  
 China Southern, the nation's largest carrier, will benefit
most, according to Lam. The company may save about 230 million
yuan, he said.  
 Chinese carriers will buy jet fuel at about 5,900 yuan a ton
from China Aviation Oil Supply Corp. after the price cut. The
state-owned company is the nation's monopoly jet fuel distributor
and sets retail prices at all airports in China.  
 Surcharges  
 Shares of China Eastern rose 4 percent to 5.42 yuan today in
Shanghai. Shares of Shandong Airlines Co. gained 8.5 percent to
HK$3.85, the highest in almost three years.  
 The price of jet kerosene fell 0.6 percent yesterday to
$78.35 a barrel in  Singapore , down 16 percent from a record $93 a
barrel on Aug. 8, 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Declining oil prices have also led to lower fuel surcharges
collected by domestic airlines.  
 China Southern and other state-owned carriers cut the
surcharges on domestic flights by as much as 20 percent to
reflect declining fuel costs from Jan. 21.  
 The levy on flights of more than 800 kilometers (497 miles)
was cut to 80 yuan per ticket from the previous 100 yuan,
according to the National Development and Reform Commission. The
fee on shorter flights was reduced to 50 yuan from 60 yuan.
