             Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) 's founder
and former chief executive officer, Allen Y. Chao, today
resigned from the board. He will be succeeded as non-executive
chairman by Andrew L. Turner, a board member since 1997.  
 Chao, 62, resigned after the annual stockholder meeting
``in order to pursue other business activities,'' Watson said
today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire. Chao founded
the company, the second-largest U.S. maker of generic drugs, 25
years ago. He had been chief executive officer from 1985 until
September.  
 Turner, 61, founded EnduraCare Therapy Management Inc., a
provider of rehabilitation and therapy management services, in
2000. He also is a director of The Sports Club Company Inc. and
Streamline Health Solutions Inc.  
 Watson, of Corona, California, reported May 1 that first-
quarter profit rose 60 percent. Mylan, of Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania, is the largest U.S. maker of generic drugs.
