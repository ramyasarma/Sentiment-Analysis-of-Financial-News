             Reliant Energy Inc., owner of power
plants in nine U.S. states, said first-quarter profit rose 46
percent after energy contracts gained in value. Reliant fell
after the company said earnings through 2010 would be lower than
previously forecast.  
 Net income climbed to $377.2 million, or $1.07 a share,
from $258.7 million, or 74 cents, a year earlier, Houston-based
Reliant said today in a statement. Revenue rose 19 percent to
$2.82 billion.  
 Reliant records costs and gains to make its valuation of
energy contracts reflect market prices. The adjustments, which
resulted in a $558 million gain in the first quarter, represent
a snapshot of what losses or gains would be if the energy
contracts were immediately liquidated. The gain a year earlier
was $522 million. Reliant benefits from a tight market, said
Gordon Howald, an analyst with Calyon Securities in  New York .  
 ``Demand for power continues to be strong,'' said Howald,
who has a ``buy'' rating on Reliant shares and doesn't own any.
Howald said Reliant's results missed his estimate of 11 cents a
share by 1 cent when items such as the contracts were excluded.  
 The company changed its 2008 forecast for earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or ``open
EBITDA,'' to $1.11 billion from $1.24 billion. The 2009 outlook
was changed to $1.26 billion, down from $1.49 billion, and the
2010 forecast is now $1.38 billion, down from $1.6 billion.  
 Reliant, which has about 16,000 megawatts of generating
capacity, fell 72 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $25.02 as of 1:30
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
dropped 4.7 percent this year.  
 Reliant said first-quarter open EBITDA, which doesn't
include such items as hedging gains and losses, rose 51 percent
to $172 million.  
 Earnings from plants that sell power in wholesale markets
rose 67 percent to $142 million, Reliant said. Profit from
retail power sales fell 2.9 percent to $66 million.  
 Higher Coal Prices  
 The open EBITDA outlook declined in part because of higher
coal prices, Pat Hammond, a Reliant spokeswoman, said today in a
telephone interview. The prices for coal and natural gas aren't
the most important factors for the company, Chief Executive
Officer Mark Jacobs said today on a call with analysts and
investors.  
 ``The fundamental tightening of supply and demand will have
a far greater and more sustained impact on earnings and  cash
flow ,'' Jacobs said.  
 Spot prices in the PJM Interconnection LLC power market,
the largest in the U.S., averaged $78.60 per megawatt-hour in
the first quarter, up 19 percent from a year earlier. Jacobs has
sought to sell assets and expand Reliant's commercial and
industrial retail business into New York. The company had losses
of more than $2.5 billion from 2002 to 2006.
