             OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s second-largest
food retailer, rose the most in a month in Moscow trading after
saying December sales gained 44 percent on store openings.  
 Magnit climbed 58.94 rubles, or 12 percent, to 553.27 rubles
on the Micex Stock Exchange, reaching the highest in almost three
months. The advance was the biggest one-day gain since Dec. 11.  
 Sales reached 15.6 billion rubles ($510 million) last
month, the Krasnodar, southern Russia-based company said in a
statement today. Magnit opened 102 stores in December,
increasing its selling space by 26 percent.  
 The retailer, which mainly runs convenience food stores, is
expanding across Russia to capitalize on rising incomes outside
of the country’s largest cities. Same-store sales in the fourth
quarter climbed 19 percent in ruble terms, while the amount of
purchases increased 0.2 percent, the company reported today.  
 “Magnit demonstrated a very healthy performance which
further indicates its position as a market leader in the
convenience store and hypermarket formats in the regions where
it has operations,” Natasha Zagvozdina and Ulyana Tipsina,
analysts at  Renaissance Capital  in Moscow, wrote in a note. They
have a “buy” recommendation on the stock.  
 Full-year sales gained 42 percent to 132.4 billion rubles.
Magnit opened 382 outlets last year, raising the total to 2,579.
