             Anhui Conch Cement Co. (600585)  paced gains in
Chinese cement makers in Shanghai trading after the nation's
strongest earthquake in 58 years in western Sichuan province
raised expectations demand will increase to rebuild damaged areas.  
 Anhui Conch, China's biggest cement producer, added 5.5
percent to close at 64.19 yuan in Shanghai. Its Hong Kong-listed
 stock  rose 5.3 percent.  Huaxin Cement Co. (600801) , controlled by  Holcim
Ltd. (HOLN) , the world's second-biggest cement maker, gained 10 percent
to 25.56 yuan in Shanghai trading.  
 ``The rally today will be driven by the earthquake, or
potential expectation of reconstruction demand in western
China,'' Nick Lai, a Taipei-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
said in a telephone interview today. ``It's more sentiment-driven
rather than fundamental.''  
 The 7.9-magnitude earthquake struck 90 kilometers (56 miles)
from the central city of  Chengdu , capital of Sichuan yesterday,
killing more than 11,000 people. Sichuan and surrounding areas
are among the most populous in the country, and the province has
40 percent of China's gas deposits.  
 Tangshan Jidong Cement Co. (000401) , based in the northern Hebei
province, rose by the daily 10 percent limit to 18.81  yuan  in
Shenzhen. Beijing-based  China National Building Material Co. (3323) , a
maker of cement in southern, central and northern China, gained
7.1 percent to HK$18.70 in Hong Kong.  China National Materials
Co. (1893) , the Beijing-based maker of cement-producing equipment,
gained 10 percent to HK$7.95 in Hong Kong.  
 Hong Kong's  benchmark   Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 2 percent, and
the mainland's CSI 300 Index fell 1.4 percent.  
 Rising Demand  
 Cement demand in Sichuan last year rose to 62 million tons,
about 5 percent of the nation's total, according to Lai. Paris-
based  Lafarge SA (LG) , the world's biggest cement maker, has about 23
million tons of capacity in western China, Lai said.  
 ``Lafarge is definitely the largest player,'' the analyst
said. ``If there's any demand pickup after the earthquake for
reconstruction, Lafarge should benefit more from that.''  
 Conch, based in eastern China's Anhui province, operates
mainly in southern China, while Huaxin is in central China.
 Sichuan Shuangma Cement Co. (000935) , controlled by Lafarge, was suspended
in Shenzhen.  
 Shares of 66 companies have been halted on the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges until the companies provide investors with
updates on the impact of the earthquake, the China Securities
Journal reported today.  
 Asia Cement Corp. (1102) , Taiwan's second-biggest maker of the
construction material, said it shut a factory in Sichuan province
after the tremor caused ``slight'' damage to equipment. The
shares increased 7 percent to NT$55.3.  
 The company plans to restart the factory within two days,
Taipei-based Asia Cement said in a filing to the Taiwan Stock
Exchange today. The factory in Chengdu city had an annual
capacity of more than 2 million tons of cement products as of
2007, according to its Web site.
