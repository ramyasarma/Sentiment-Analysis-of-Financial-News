             Reliant Energy Inc., the owner of
power plants in nine U.S. states, had its biggest drop in six
years in New York trading after the company cut its earnings
projections and cited ``unacceptable'' performance in its retail
electricity business.  
 Houston-based Reliant dropped $2.73, or 27 percent, to
$7.35 in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The decline
was the company's biggest since July 2002, when investors shed
the stock amid concern Reliant might run short of cash. The
power producer has lost more than half of its market value since
Sept. 15.  
 Reliant cut its  forecast  for ``retail contribution
margin,'' a measure of profit from its retail power business, by
$300 million to $350 million, according to a statement after the
close of regular trading yesterday. The company slashed its
forecast for earnings from wholesale power sales by almost half.  
 ``Our 2008 retail results are disappointing and
unacceptable,'' Chief Executive Officer Mark Jacobs said today
on a conference call with investors and analysts.  
 Reliant said in yesterday's statement that it arranged for
$1 billion of additional  capital , including a $650 million  term
loan  from GS Loan Partners. The company will end its practice of
using Merrill Lynch & Co. to provide guarantees and post
collateral for power purchases and other transactions in its
retail business, according to the statement.  
 Merrill Arrangement  
 Reliant decided to end the Merrill tie because ``it was no
longer an attractive arrangement'' for either party, Jacobs said
today. Merrill, the world's biggest brokerage firm, is being
acquired by Bank of America Corp.  
 ``The world has changed materially for both Merrill Lynch
and Reliant Energy since the credit sleeve was put in place in
2006,'' Jacobs said. He said raising new capital ``was both
expensive and challenging.''  
 Merrill provided a credit facility that allowed Reliant to
draw as much as $300 million in working capital for retail
operations. That agreement included a requirement that Reliant
meet a minimum earnings target, a covenant that Merrill agreed
to waive so long as the company didn't use any of the credit.  
 Reliant's move to get more capital was conservative, said
Gordon Howald, an analyst with Calyon Securities in  New York .
Reliant put its total liquidity at $2.7 billion, including
expected sources such as $500 million from the planned sale of a
Nevada power plant.  
 `No Risk of Insolvency'  
 ``There's no risk of insolvency here, and the market is
almost treating this company as though there was a risk of
that,'' Howald said.  
 Selling Reliant's retail power business isn't a
``reasonable'' option for now because it wouldn't fetch a good
price under current market conditions, Howald said. He lowered
his rating on Reliant shares to ``neutral'' from ``add'' and cut
his 12-month target for the stock's price to $10 from $22.  
 ``The market is just not going to pay for future cash-flow
generation potential at this point in time,'' Howald said.  
 Texas opened its power industry to competition in 2002,
forming a system in which former monopoly utility companies such
as Reliant can be undercut on prices by other retailers.  
 Hurricane Ike contributed to an earnings shortfall from
retail power sales, Reliant said. Ike struck the Texas coast on
Sept. 13 and knocked out power service to more than 2 million
homes and businesses in the Houston area, Reliant's home market.
