             Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Germany's
biggest airline, criticized a Russian request that the company
move a cargo hub to central Siberia from  Kazakhstan  as part of a
broader disagreement that involves overflight rights.  
 Lufthansa said the Russian government has called on it to
move its regional freight-handling hub in the Kazakh capital of
Astana almost 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) eastward to
Krasnoyarsk, airline spokesman Michael Goentgens said.  
 ``Krasnoyarsk at the moment lacks sufficient technical
infrastructure,'' Goentgens said in a phone interview.  
 Russian government officials couldn't be reached for
comment after the close of business in Moscow.  
 Cologne, Germany-based Lufthansa and Russian competitor  OAO
Aeroflot (AFLT)  were forced to reroute some cargo aircraft this week
during the overflight dispute. Lufthansa planes were prohibited
Oct. 28 from flying across  Russia  to reach other countries.
Aeroflot cargo aircraft have been denied entry into Germany.  
 Russia, which stretches across 11 time zones, is a major
transit route for goods flowing between Asia and Europe.  
 Germany and Russia are in talks to resolve
``misunderstandings'' that led to the ban on Lufthansa flights,
Sven Ulbrich, a spokesman for Germany's Transport Ministry, said
yesterday. He declined to give details about the dispute.
