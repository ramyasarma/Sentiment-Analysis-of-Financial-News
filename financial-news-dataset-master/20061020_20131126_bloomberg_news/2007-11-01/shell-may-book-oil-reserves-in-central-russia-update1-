             Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  may book half the
oil reserves from its project in central Russia to develop heavy
crude deposits with regional oil company OAO Tatneft.  
 Shell will book reserves in proportion to its share in the
project, which is still under discussion, Vladlen Voskoboinikov,
Tatneft's head of consolidated financial reporting, said on a
conference call today.  
 ``We see the relationship growing as one of equal partners,''
Voskoboinikov said. ``If we have a 50-50 relationship, they'll be
able to book half the reserves.''  
 The Russian republic of Tatarstan, where Tatneft is based,
holds reserves of as much as 7 billion tons of bitumen, or heavy
crude oil, as estimated by the local government.  Russia  last year
cut extraction taxes on output from hard-to-recover fields that
require expensive technology, making the bitumen project
economically attractive. Shell is already developing heavy oil
projects in Oman, Canada and the U.S.  
 Tatneft and Shell have agreed on 12 fields and are considering
additional deposits, Voskoboinikov said.  
 ``We're working very closely with Shell to put together some
numbers,'' Voskoboinikov said, adding that a concrete plan for the
venture would be ready in the first or second quarter of 2008.
