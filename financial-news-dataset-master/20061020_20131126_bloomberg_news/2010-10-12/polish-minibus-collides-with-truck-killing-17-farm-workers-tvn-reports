An overcrowded Polish minibus
crashed head-on into a truck, killing 17 agricultural workers,
 TVN24  reported, citing the Interior Ministry.  The passengers killed in Nowe Miasto nad Pilica, about 50
kilometers south of Warsaw, were traveling to jobs picking
apples, Malgorzata Wozniak, a spokeswoman for the ministry, told
the all-news television channel in a live phone conversation.  The Volkswagen Transporter was overloaded and at least some
of the passengers weren’t wearing seatbelts, the station’s
website quoted police spokeswoman Magdalena Siczek-Zalewska as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
