KME Group , a maker of copper parts
used in cars and washing machines, expects to increase output as
much as 19 percent this year to meet growing demand.  Production may climb to 520,000 metric tons of copper and
copper-alloy products, Chief Financial Officer  Italo Romano  of
Florence, Italy-based KME said in an interview in London
yesterday. Last year, production from its 13 plants in Europe
was 437,000 tons as demand for some products dropped more than
50 percent because of global recession, he said.  “In 2010, we see for the first six months a recovery of
about 20 percent,” he said. “The recovery is essentially
located in the north of Europe” such as in France and Germany,
Romano said.  It will take at least two years for demand to return to
levels in 2008, before the recession, Romano said. Copper prices
plunged a record 54 percent in London that year as the world
entered its worst recession since World War II, before more than
doubling in 2009 on demand from China, the world’s largest
copper buyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
