Korea Gas Corp., the world’s
biggest buyer of liquefied natural gas, said it’s in talks to
acquire a 15 percent stake in the  Santos Ltd. -led Gladstone
LNG venture in Australia to supply Asia’s fourth-largest
economy.  The state-run utility is also in talks to buy 9.8
percent of Indonesia’s Senoro project run by  Mitsubishi Corp. 
and for 15 percent of its LNG processing plant, the company
said in a prepared report to South Korean lawmakers today.  Korea Gas didn’t say how much the Gladstone LNG stake
may cost. Yonhap News reported Aug. 27 that the company was
near agreement on buying a 10 percent stake in the project
for $1.5 billion, citing a company official it didn’t
identify.  The Seongnam-based company is seeking stable supplies of
the cleaner-burning fuel and said in May it plans to spend
17.8 trillion won ($15.8 billion) by 2017 on overseas
expansions.  Matthew Doman , a spokesman for Adelaide-based
Santos, didn’t immediately return a phone call today seeking
comment on the discussions.  Separately, Korea Gas said it expects the nation’s gas
demand between October and March to increase by 11 percent
from a year earlier as economic recovery boosts consumption.
The state-run utility projects demand of 20.4 million metric
tons for the period, according to the report to lawmakers.  Korea Gas plans to focus on short-term contracts to
secure the fuel until 2014 because it expects oversupply in
the global LNG market to continue for the next four years,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
