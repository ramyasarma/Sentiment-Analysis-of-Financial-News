Asian currencies fell for a second
day, led by South Korea’s won, on concern policy makers around
the region will intervene to check appreciation that may hurt
exporters.  The won dropped 1.3 percent to 1,131.45 per dollar as of 3
p.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China’s
yuan declined 0.1 percent, the most since Aug. 23, to 6.6736.
Thailand’s baht traded at 30.00 from 30.05 yesterday as the
government said it will impose a tax on domestic bonds purchased
by overseas investors to stem gains in the surging currency.  “Regional currencies have appreciated quite a lot, to a
level where investors are concerned about intervention or even
introduction of measures to stem gains,” said  Minori Uchida , a
senior analyst in Tokyo at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
“Still, the longer-term trend is that quantitative easing in
some major economies will boost fund inflows into emerging
markets.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, dropped
0.3 percent to 114.82. The gauge reached 115.48 last week, the
highest level since April 2008, as overseas investors pumped
money into the region to benefit from the world’s fastest pace
of economic growth.  Intervention Threat  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.4 percent in 2010,
compared with growth of 2.7 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast on Oct. 6. Global funds
bought a combined $38 billion more equities in India, South
Korea and Taiwan than they sold this year, according to stock
exchange data.  The won retreated from a five-month high after Japan said
it is prepared to intervene to combat gains in its currency,
spurring speculation the Bank of Korea will follow suit to
protect exports. Japan admitted on Sept. 15 that it had entered
the market for the first time since 2004 to check the yen’s
strength. Central banks intervene in currency markets by
arranging purchases or sales of foreign exchange.  “It looks like Japan is not necessarily done on
intervention,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist
at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. “That is supporting the
dollar against the yen and has impacted some other pairs as
well.”  Tax Plan  The yuan dropped as China’s central bank set the reference
rate weaker for the first time in three days after the dollar
rebounded against the euro. The U.S. Dollar Index traded on ICE
Futures in New York, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six trading partners, has gained 0.3 percent this
week.  Thailand will remove a tax exemption of 15 percent on bonds
purchased by foreigners, the finance ministry said after a
Cabinet meeting in Bangkok today. Non-resident investors are
currently exempt from tax on income from government and quasi-
government bonds. The baht has advanced 10.6 percent so far in
2010 as global funds bought $1.6 billion more Thai stocks than
they sold.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit dropped 0.2 percent to 3.1085
per dollar and Singapore’s dollar slipped 0.2 percent to
S$1.3091. Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to NT$31.07 and
the Philippine peso declined 0.1 percent to 43.655. The
Indonesian rupiah was little changed at 8,938.  To contact the reporter on this story:
