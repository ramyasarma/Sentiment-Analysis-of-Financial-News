Korea Gas Corp., the world’s biggest
buyer of liquefied natural gas, plans to raise as much as $1
billion from dollar-denominated bonds to fund overseas
investments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The Seongnam-based company hired five banks to help it sell
notes this month, the person said, declining to name the banks
and asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  The state-run utility is in talks to buy a 15 percent stake
in the  Santos Ltd. -led Gladstone gas venture in Australia, it
said in a report to South Korean lawmakers today. It also plans
to purchase 9.8 percent of Indonesia’s Senoro project run by
 Mitsubishi Corp. , according to the statement.  Korea Gas officials planned to visit the U.S. last week to
meet investors, a person familiar with that matter said on Sept.
30. Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG
arranged the meetings, the person said.  A company spokesman, who said company policy forbids him
from giving his name, said he had no knowledge of the matter
when Bloomberg News called Korea Gas’s main office today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
