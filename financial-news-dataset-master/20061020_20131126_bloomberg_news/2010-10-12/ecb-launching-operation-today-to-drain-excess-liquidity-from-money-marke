The European Central Bank said it
will launch a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation today to
counter a “large positive” imbalance at the end of its reserve
maintenance period.  The ECB said it will absorb funds at a maximum bid rate of
1 percent, the bank’s benchmark interest rate, without a pre-set
amount.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
