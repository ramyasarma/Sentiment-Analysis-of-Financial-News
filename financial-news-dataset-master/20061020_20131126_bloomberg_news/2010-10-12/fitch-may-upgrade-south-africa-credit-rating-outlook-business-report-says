Fitch Ratings may upgrade the
outlook on South Africa’s BBB+ credit rating to stable or
positive from negative next month, Business Report said, citing
Veronica Kalema, an analyst at the ratings agency.  The size of South Africa’s budget deficit, scheduled to be
announced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Oct. 27, will be
the "swing factor" in Fitch’s review, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper quoted Kalema as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
