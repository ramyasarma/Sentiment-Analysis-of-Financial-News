Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB ,
the operator of airports in southern Mexico, dropped the most in
three weeks as Hurricane Paula threatened the Yucatan Peninsula
region, where the resorts of Cancun and Cozumel are located.  Shares of Asur, as the company is known, declined 2.5
percent to 60.03 pesos at 4 p.m. New York time, the biggest drop
since Sept. 23.  “The movement is basically because of the hurricane,”
said  Pablo Duarte de Leon , an analyst with Corp. Actinver SAB.
“There could be floods and the cancellation of flights.”  Paula, the ninth hurricane of the June through November
Atlantic season, is now packing sustained winds of 100 miles
(161 kilometers) per hour, the Miami-based National Hurricane
Center said in a website  advisory  at 12:45 p.m. Cancun time.
That makes Paula a Category 2 storm on the five-step  Saffir-
Simpson  scale, with winds capable of uprooting trees and
smashing windows, the center said.  The system was 140 miles south-southeast of the resort
island of Cozumel, moving north-northwest at 10 mph, according
to the advisory.  The company said its passenger traffic rose 5 percent in
September from the same month last year, according to comments
made Oct. 5 in a statement to Mexico’s stock exchange.  The  IPC index  fell 0.1 percent to 34,437.39.  To contact the reporter on this story:
