A union representing workers at
Kenya Airways Ltd. decided to suspend plans to start a strike
tomorrow, its general secretary said.  “We are suspending the strike because Kenya Airways
secured a court order deeming a strike illegal,” Bonne Nicholas
Barasa of the Aviation & Allied Workers’ Union said by phone
from Nairobi today. “We are meeting at the Labor Ministry
tomorrow for talks” with Kenya Airways management and led by a
government-appointed conciliator, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
