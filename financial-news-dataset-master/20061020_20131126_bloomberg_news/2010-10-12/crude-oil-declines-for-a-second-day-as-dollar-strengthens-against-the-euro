Crude oil fell below $82 a barrel on
speculation that U.S. inventories rose to a three-month high
last week and signs that OPEC will leave production targets
unchanged.  Crude dropped two days before the U.S. Energy Department’s
report, which may show a gain of 1.4 million barrels to 362.3
million, according to the median estimate of 17 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey. Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi ,
whose country is the largest OPEC producer, called the global
market “well-balanced” yesterday.  “Demand for petroleum products is weak and inventories are
high,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. OPEC is signaling “it will keep quotas
unchanged, and it’s bearish in a sense that it helps maintain an
overall supply surplus in the market,” he said.  Crude for November delivery fell 54 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $81.67 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract reached a five-month high of $84.43 last
week. Prices have risen 11 percent in the past year.  Brent crude for November settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell 22 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $83.50
a barrel.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release last week’s
petroleum data on Oct. 14 at 11 a.m. in Washington, a day later
than usual because of yesterday’s Columbus Day holiday.  The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will
report its numbers tomorrow.  Inventories Rising  Crude inventories rose 0.9 percent to 360.9 million barrels
in the week ended Oct. 1, the Energy Department reported last
week.  Total petroleum supplies  were 1.14 billion barrels, 0.4
percent below a record set Sept. 17.  Fuel consumption  dropped 6.4 percent to 18.5 million
barrels a day Oct. 1, the biggest weekly decline since Feb. 27,
2004, according to the department.  Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, gathering in Vienna this week, signaled they won’t
alter their existing output targets. OPEC raised its forecast
for 2010 global oil demand today by 100,000 barrels a day to
85.59 million. That compares with 84.46 million last year.  World consumption is forecast to rise 1.2 percent to 86.64
million barrels a day next year, OPEC said.  “Traders are reducing their positions, waiting for the
OPEC meeting,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a market strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.  Saudi Arabia’s al-Naimi said yesterday that oil prices
between $70 and $80 a barrel are “ideal.”  “OPEC is in a comfortable position to do nothing,” said
 Kaha Kiknavelidze , a managing partner at London-based Rioni
Capital Partners LLP, which specializes in emerging markets.  Al-Naimi ‘Happy’  Al-Naimi, speaking upon his arrival in Vienna, said he is
“happy” with current prices. The kingdom pumped 8.25 million
barrels a day in September, according to a Bloomberg News
survey.  OPEC has raised output by 5 percent from a five-year low
reached in March 2009 and now exceeds its own target by
1.9 million barrels a day. Production was 29.1 million barrels a
day last month, based on Bloomberg News estimates.  Oil demand will grow by 1.5 million barrels a day this year
and 1.4 million in 2011,  Sandrine Toerstad , head of market
analysis at Statoil ASA, Norway’s biggest oil and gas producer,
said in a presentation in Oslo today.  Supply from non-OPEC countries is forecast to grow 925,000
barrels a day this year and 100,000 in 2011, Toerstad said.  Lower Price Forecast  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. today cut its price forecasts
for West Texas Intermediate, which trades in New York, as  U.S.
crude stockpiles  have risen about 7 percent in the last year.  WTI may average $90 a barrel in 2011, down from the
research company’s earlier estimate of $103, and $102 in 2012,
down 8 percent from its earlier prediction, according to a
report e-mailed today.  A nationwide strike by French refinery, power and gas
workers lowered crude processing rates. The possibility of fuel
shortages loomed as Marseille oil terminals remained blocked.  Workers at 10 of the country’s 12 refineries voted to
strike today and others may follow, Christian Votte, a CGT union
representative, said by telephone. Deliveries to and from plants
on strike will be blocked and refining rates reduced, he said.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 619,590
contracts as of 3:38 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 544,795
contracts yesterday, 20 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.42 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
