Colombia, Germany, India and South
Africa were elected today to the  United Nations  Security Council
and will begin two-year terms on the panel on Jan. 1.  The four countries were elected on the first ballot in the
UN General Assembly because they received the required two-
thirds majority of the 192 members. Canada and Portugal,
competing for a fifth seat, didn’t get enough votes on the first
ballot, so a second was held.  The five new members will take seats that are now held by
Austria, Japan, Mexico, Turkey and Uganda.  The UN’s principal policy-making panel has 15 members,
including the permanent seat-holders, China, the U.K., France,
Russia and the U.S.  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Gabon, Lebanon and Nigeria
currently hold the other five non-permanent seats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
