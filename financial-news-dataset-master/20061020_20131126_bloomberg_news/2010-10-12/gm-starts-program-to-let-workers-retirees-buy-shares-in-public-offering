General Motors Co., the largest U.S.
automaker, started a program to allow workers, retirees, dealers
and directors in the U.S. and Canada to buy shares in its
planned initial public offering.  Participants can register for the program by mail
postmarked by Oct. 19 or sign up online by Oct. 22, according to
a  website  run by GM and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which will
administer the program.  Pete Ternes , a GM spokesman, confirmed
the website’s authenticity.  The minimum investment for the program is expected to be
$1,000, according to the website. The minimum and maximum number
of shares that will be allowed is still being determined, the
website said. The Detroit Free Press reported the worker-retiree
share program earlier.  GM, 61 percent owned by the U.S. Treasury Department, will
seek to raise $8 billion to $10 billion in an IPO in November, a
smaller sale than the automaker originally targeted, two people
familiar with the matter said in September. The price of the
shares hasn’t been set.  Morgan Stanley ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Bank of America Corp.
and Citigroup Inc. will lead the offering, according to a Sept.
23 regulatory filing. Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG,
Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Royal Bank of Canada
and UBS AG were also listed as underwriters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
