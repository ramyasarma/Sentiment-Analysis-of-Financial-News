Treasuries gained, sending two-year
note yields to a record low, as traders speculated minutes of
the Federal Reserve’s September meeting will indicate policy
makers are preparing to step up debt purchases.  The 10-year  note yield  approached the lowest level since
January 2009 after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that September
job losses “put the seal on” the case for the Fed to increase
quantitative easing. Today’s $32 billion auction of notes
maturing in October 2013 was poised to draw a record low yield.  “There’s a strong bias to come up with more QE at the next
meeting to prevent the U.S. toppling into a deflation trend,”
said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA
in Munich. “The minutes will in the end have a positive impact
on the Treasuries market.”  The yield on the 10-year note fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.35 percent at 7:29 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in August 2020 advanced 11/32, or
$3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 102 3/8. The rate dropped to
2.33 percent on Oct. 8, the lowest level since January 2009.  Two-year yields extended their decline to  record lows ,
falling to 0.327 percent today. The 30-year bond yield dropped 5
basis points to 3.70 percent.  MSCI’s Asia Pacific Index of  shares  slid 1.5 percent, the
most since August, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index of European
equities fell 0.6 percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index fell 0.6 percent.  Fed Purchases  Treasuries rallied on Sept. 21, when the central bank said
in a statement following the Federal Open Market Committee
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed to support economic recovery and to return inflation,
over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”  The Fed will probably announce about $500 billion of
purchases that will last through about the middle of next year
at a meeting next month,  Jan Hatzius , chief U.S. economist at
Goldman Sachs in New York, said to clients via e-mail.  A Labor Department report Oct. 8 showing 95,000 jobs
eliminated in September will prompt the central bank to buy
bonds, Hatzius wrote.  “Friday’s jobs numbers put the seal on a quantitative
easing announcement at the Nov. 2-3 FOMC meeting,” according to
Goldman Sachs, one of the 18 primary dealers that are authorized
to trade directly with the Fed.  Break-Even Rate  The difference between yields on 30-year bonds and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities narrowed for the first time since
Sept. 30. The  break-even rate , a measure of inflation
expectations over the life of the maturity, slid 0.14 percentage
point to 2.20 percentage points.  Janet Yellen , in her first public remarks as the Fed vice
chairman, said low interest rates may give firms the incentive
to engage in excessive risk-taking.  “It is conceivable that accommodative monetary policy
could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and excessive
risk-taking in the financial system,” she said in a speech
yesterday.  The three-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.53
percent in pre-auction trading, which would be the least ever.
The  rate  was 0.79 percent at the previous sale of the securities
on Sept 7.  Investors bid for 3.21 times the amount of available debt
last month. The average bid-to-cover ratio of the past 10-
auctions is 3.12. Indirect  bidders , which include foreign
central banks, bought 42.4 percent of the securities, versus the
10-sale average of 47.5 percent.  Demand in Japan  For investors in Japan coping with record-low rates, U.S.
debt is relatively  cheap . Ten-year Treasuries yield 1.49
percentage points more than similar-maturity Japanese government
bonds, up from 0.82 percentage point in December 2008.  Japan is poised to pass China as the largest U.S.  creditor 
for the first time since August 2008 as growing demand for U.S.
debt reduces borrowing costs for President  Barack Obama .  “Treasuries are quite attractive, especially from the view
of Japanese investors, because there still is a yield,” said
 Satoshi Okumoto , a general manager in Tokyo at Fukoku Mutual
Life Insurance Co., whose firm has the equivalent of $66.4
billion in assets.  Investors in a survey by Ried Thunberg ICAP Inc., a unit of
the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, became more bearish on
the outlook for Treasuries through the end of December.  Ried’s sentiment index fell to 45 for the seven days ended
Oct. 8 from 47 the week before. A figure less than 50 indicates
that investors expect prices to fall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
