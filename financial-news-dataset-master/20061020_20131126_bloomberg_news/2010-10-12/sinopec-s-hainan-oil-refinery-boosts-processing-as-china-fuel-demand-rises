China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ,
Asia’s biggest refiner, will process 6 percent more crude oil at
its Hainan plant this month compared with September because of
rising domestic demand, an official at the refinery said.  The plant will refine 760,000 metric tons of crude this
month, or about 180,000 barrels a day, compared with 720,000
tons in September, said the official, who declined to be
identified because of company rules.  The plant in southern China’s Hainan Island has an annual
capacity of 8 million tons, or 160,000 barrels a day.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors:  Jane Lee ,  John Viljoen .  To contact the reporter on this story:
