Ethiopia ’s government signed a peace
agreement with a faction of the rebel Ogaden National Liberation
Front led by Salahdin Maow.  An accord was signed in Addis Ababa, the capital, today by
Salahdin and Federal Affairs Minister Shiferaw Teklemariam. As
part of the agreement, members of the ONLF will be offered
amnesty and those in prison will be released, Shiferaw told
reporters at the signing ceremony.  “The state of insurgency is terminated and peace is
established,” he said.  Abdirahman Mahdi, spokesman for a separate ONLF faction,
said in an e-mail that today’s deal was an attempt to “hoodwink
the international community.”  The ONLF has been fighting for self-determination for the
people of the Ogaden for 16 years. The region is an arid zone
that covers much of Ethiopia’s Somali Regional State and borders
 Somalia . Ethiopia has previously described the group as a
terrorist organization backed by neighboring  Eritrea .  Salahdin said his faction signed the peace deal because “we
have come to understand the destructive nature of war.”  The Ethiopian government and the ONLF have previously
claimed battlefield victories and accused each other of
atrocities. Verification of the reports is difficult as the
government bars foreign journalists from traveling independently
in the region, much of which is under military administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
