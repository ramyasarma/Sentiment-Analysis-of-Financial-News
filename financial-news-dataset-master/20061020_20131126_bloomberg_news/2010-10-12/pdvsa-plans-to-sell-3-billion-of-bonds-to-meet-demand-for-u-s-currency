Petroleos de Venezuela SA,  the state
oil company, plans to sell $3 billion of bonds in the local
market as part of effort to meet demand for U.S. currency.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is known, will provide
further details on the sale of the 2017 bonds in a prospectus on
Oct. 18, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Investors
will be allowed to buy the dollar-denominated bonds with
bolivars, according to the statement.  Venezuela, which sets two exchange rates for imports and a
third rate that is determined by the central bank, is seeking to
meet demand for dollars among companies and individuals after
President  Hugo Chavez  closed the unregulated currency market in
May. Chavez said on Oct. 2 half of the proceeds of the bond sale
will help finance the building of low-income housing. PDVSA sold
$6.3 billion of bonds last year and $1.04 billion of debt in
August.  “PDVSA is issuing bonds to help the government finance
social programs and to supply dollars to importers,” said
 Alejandro Grisanti , an analyst at Barclays Plc in New York.  PDVSA also said in today’s statement that it will offer to
exchange its bonds due in 2011 for securities that mature in
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
