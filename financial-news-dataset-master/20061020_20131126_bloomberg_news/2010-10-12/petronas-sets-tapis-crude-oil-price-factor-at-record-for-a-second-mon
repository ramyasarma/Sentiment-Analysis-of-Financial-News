Petroliam Nasional Bhd. , Malaysia’s
state oil and gas company, increased a price-adjustment factor
for its benchmark  Tapis  crude to a record for a second month.  Petronas, as the Kuala Lumpur-based company is known,
raised the factor to $4.20 a barrel for October, up 10 cents
from September, said an official today, asking not to be
identified because of corporate policy. Last year, the
adjustment factor averaged $2.48.  The increase follows a recovery in profit for turning light
crude such as Tapis into gasoil, or diesel. The product’s
premium to Dubai crude, the Asian benchmark, ended September
trading at $11.97 a barrel, the first monthly gain in three,
according to brokers PVM Oil Associates. This  crack spread 
climbed to $13.38 today, the highest since Aug. 3.  Petronas includes the Tapis adjustment factor in its
formula for calculating monthly crude official selling prices.
The other component is the average of twice-weekly assessments
compiled by the Asian Petroleum Price Index, a Hong Kong-based
panel of traders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
