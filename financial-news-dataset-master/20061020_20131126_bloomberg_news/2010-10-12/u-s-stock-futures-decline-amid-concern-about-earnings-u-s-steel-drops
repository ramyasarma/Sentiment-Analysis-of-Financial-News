U.S. stocks rose, erasing earlier
losses and sending benchmark indexes to five-month highs, as
Federal Reserve policy makers indicated they are ready to pump
more cash into the economy to protect the recovery.  Bank of America Corp.,  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. helped lead a recovery by the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index after minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 21 meeting showed the
central bank was ready to ease monetary policy “before long.”
King Pharmaceuticals Inc. jumped 39 percent, the most in 11
years, after agreeing to be bought by Pfizer Inc.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 1,169.77 at 4 p.m. in
New York after sliding 0.8 percent earlier. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 10.06 points, or 0.1 percent, to
11,020.40 after earlier tumbling as much as 97 points. Both
gauges closed at the highest levels since May.  “The minutes supported the general notion that the Federal
Reserve will be engaged in quantitative easing,” said  David Kovacs , head of quantitative strategies at Turner Investment
Partners in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, which manages $19 billion.
“There is pretty strong empirical evidence that when there is
quantitative easing, the liquidity that’s been added to the
system finds its way into equities.”  Fed Minutes  Benchmark indexes erased earlier losses today as the Fed
minutes showed policy makers “wanted to consider further the
most effective framework for calibrating and communicating any
additional steps to provide such stimulus.” The S&P 500 last
month climbed 8.8 percent, its best September since 1939, as the
central bank said it’s willing to ease monetary policy further.  The Fed also said for the first time that it was
considering targeting a path for the level of nominal gross
domestic product as a way to increase price expectations.  The central bank is likely to announce plans to buy about
$500 billion of Treasury purchases by mid-2011 and indicate they
are ready to buy more to keep the U.S. out of recession,  Jan Hatzius , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s New York-based chief U.S.
economist, said in a note.  Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender, gained 2.8
percent to $13.52. JPMorgan Chase, the second-largest, rose 1.7
percent to $40.40. Goldman Sachs, the most profitable U.S.
investment bank, rose 2 percent to $155.21.  Financial companies in the S&P 500 rallied 1.3 percent as a
group for the biggest gain among 10 industries.  King, Starbucks  King Pharmaceuticals  surged 39 percent, the most since
November 1999, to $14.14 for the biggest advance in the S&P 500.
Pfizer, the world’s biggest drugmaker, said it would pay $3.6
billion, or $14.25 a share, for the maker of long-acting
painkillers. Pfizer climbed 0.6 percent to $17.48.  Starbucks Corp.  rose the most since May, climbing 4.4
percent to $27.14. Credit Suisse Group AG raised earnings
estimates for the world’s largest coffee-shop chain to $1.45 a
share from $1.44 a share for 2011, and to $1.69 from $1.63 for
2012.  U.S. equity indexes retreated earlier on concern growth in
Asian economies would could.  U.S. Steel Corp.  fell 1.7 percent to $44.83 after South
Korean rival Posco, the world’s third-largest steelmaker,
reported its first decline in earnings in four quarters. Posco
also cut its full-year earnings forecast by 7 percent. Operating
profit will probably be 5.2 trillion won ($4.6 billion) for the
12 months ending Dec. 31, Posco said today. That compares with
its earlier forecast of 5.6 trillion won.  Earnings Watch  “Investors will likely worry about two key reported items
out of Posco,” said  Steven Neimeth , a money manager at
SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, which
oversees $41 billion. “It appears their outlook for revenues
has slowed, suggesting economic growth out of Asia may be
slowing. More importantly, inflation in their raw materials
prices appears to be moving up at a fairly dramatic pace,
crimping operating profits.”  Eighteen companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to release
third-quarter results this week. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
predict 23 percent profit growth from a year earlier for
companies in the index, the fourth straight quarterly increase
after a record nine-quarter slump.  Verizon Communications Inc.  dropped 1.5 percent to $32.54
for the biggest drop in the Dow. The wireless provider was cut
to “underperform” from “market perform” at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. by equity analyst  Craig Moffett , who cited its
high dividend payout ratio and underfunded pension obligations.  Electronic Arts Slumps  Electronic Arts Inc.  fell 6 percent to $16.61 for the
biggest decline in the S&P 500. The second-largest video-game
publisher released its “Medal of Honor” game today to
disappointing early reviews,  Doug Creutz , an analyst at Cowen &
Co., said in a report.  Expedia Inc. dropped 2.1 percent to $27.91. The biggest
Internet travel agency is among the companies interested in
buying Opodo Ltd., a European online travel agency, Dow Jones
Newswires reported, citing people familiar with the situation.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.  Fastenal Co. fell 5 percent to $52.04. The largest U.S.
retailer of nuts, bolts and other fasteners said its goal of
average monthly sales of $125,000 per store by 2012 could take
an additional two years to achieve.  To contact the reporters on this story:
