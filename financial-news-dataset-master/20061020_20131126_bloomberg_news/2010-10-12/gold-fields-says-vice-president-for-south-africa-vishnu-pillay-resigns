Gold Fields Ltd. , Africa’s second-
largest producer of the metal, said  Vishnu Pillay , executive
vice president for the South Africa region, resigned this month
for personal reasons.  Tim Rowland , vice president technical for the South African
operations, will take his place in an acting capacity until a
replacement is named,  Gold Fields  said in an e-mailed response
to queries today. Pillay will leave at the end of the year,
spokesman  Sven Lunsche  said.  Pillay oversaw Gold Fields’ largest mines, located in South
Africa, which accounted for 55 percent of the company’s total
3.5 million ounces of production in fiscal 2010. Gold Fields’
biggest project is  South Deep , 28 miles southwest of
Johannesburg, where the company plans to produce 1 million
ounces a year.  Pillay, 53, was named head of the South African region on
May 1, 2008, after heading up the company’s Driefontein mine,
according to Gold Fields’ website.  Gold Fields  rose  1.24 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 107.97 rand
as of 4:09 p.m. in Johannesburg, giving it a market value of 76
billion rand ($11 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
