Gold declined for the first time in
three days as the dollar advanced, curbing the appeal of
commodities as alternative investments.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent
to $1,347.35 an ounce at 12:51 p.m. in Melbourne, after reaching
an all-time high of $1,364.77 on Oct. 7. The dollar rose 0.2
percent against a basket of six major currencies. The precious
metal typically moves in the opposite direction to the dollar.  “Given that we have seen solid upward movements in the
gold price for some time now, it is just an opportunity for
market participants to catch their breath,” said  Gavin Wendt ,
senior resource analyst at MineLife Pty in Sydney.  The dollar rose before the Federal Reserve releases today
minutes of its policy meeting on Sept. 21, when the central bank
said it was willing to ease monetary policy further to sustain
the economic recovery.  Gold for December delivery on the Comex in New York fell
0.4 percent to $1,348.90 an ounce. Futures have advanced 23
percent this year and reached an all-time high of $1,366 an
ounce on Oct. 7.  “The precious metals markets remain range-bound since
Friday afternoon, with very little interest coming from the
physical market for gold and silver at current price levels,”
 Walter de Wet , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in London, wrote
in a note.  The dollar traded at $1.3864 per euro at 9:36 a.m. in Tokyo
from $1.3876 in New York yesterday. The greenback last week
reached the lowest level since January against the basket of six
major currencies.  Global holdings  in exchange-traded products fell about 1.2
metric tons to 2,083.55 tons on Oct. 11, according to Bloomberg
data from 10 providers, after reaching a record 2,097.01 tons on
Sept. 30.  Silver fell 0.8 percent to $23.1078 an ounce at 12:44 p.m.
Melbourne time after gaining as much as 1.6 percent to $23.6325
an ounce yesterday, the highest price since 1980.  Platinum gained 0.3 percent to $1,691.38 an ounce, while
palladium was little changed at $587.63 an ounce after reaching
a nine-year high of $604 last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
