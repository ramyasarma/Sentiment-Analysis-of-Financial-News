Rubber prices in Indonesia, the
world’s second-largest producer, surged to a record  $3.85 a
kilogram today as heavy rains disrupted tapping, lowering
production, according to the Rubber Association of Indonesia.  The price may advance to $4 a kilogram by the end of the
month because of a “supply shortage” while domestic demand
keeps expanding, Asril Sutan Amir, the association’s chairman
said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
