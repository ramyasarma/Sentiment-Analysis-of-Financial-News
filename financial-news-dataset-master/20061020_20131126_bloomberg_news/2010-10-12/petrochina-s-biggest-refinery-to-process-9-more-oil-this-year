PetroChina Co.  will increase crude-
oil processing at its biggest refinery by 9 percent this year
from a year earlier as demand gains, an official said.  Refining volume at the plant in the northern city of Dalian
will rise to 17.5 million metric tons, or 350,000 barrels a day,
said a refinery official, who declined to be named because of
company rules. The facility’s oil-processing volume rose to a
record of 16.03 million tons in 2009, parent China National
Petroleum Corp. said in January.  The plant’s annual processing capacity was doubled to 20.5
million tons in August 2008, in time to meet additional fuel
demand during the Beijing Olympics.  PetroChina Dalian will meet the annual processing target
even as an oil spill in July caused crude supply disruptions,
said the official. The plant aims to refine 4.5 million tons in
the third quarter, he said.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors:  Clyde Russell ,  Ryan Woo .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
