Germany’s government sees little
chance of keeping its coal subsidies until 2018,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  The European Union decided in July to limit aid to miners
of hard coal from 2014, requiring that aid be spent on social
and ecological problems linked to closures and not on keeping
mines in business, the newspaper said. In contrast, the German
government wants to keep the subsidies four years longer,
Suedeutsche said.  The EU decision can only be reversed unanimously and
unanimity in favor of the German plan isn’t evident, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
