Carbon Conscious Ltd., a carbon
forest sink developer, said Perenia Pty contracted it to supply
10,000 future internationally exportable Australian government
backed assigned amount units, or AAUs.  Carbon Conscious will plant about 50,000 to 70,000 mallee
eucalypt trees on marginal Western Australian farmland and
deliver AAUs to Perenia under the Australian government’s Carbon
Farming initiative, the company said in a statement to the stock
exchange today.  The parties agreed a delivery price from A$16 per unit for
the transaction, which Carbon Conscious said was the first of
its kind in Australia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
