Oki Electric Industry Co. , the
Japanese maker of cash dispensers and communications equipment,
plunged in Tokyo trading after forecasting a loss on retirement
costs and currency fluctuations.  The stock dropped 16 percent to 62 yen at the close on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the most since at least 1974. Japan’s
 Nikkei  225 Stock  Average  fell 2.1 percent.  Oki Electric forecast a net loss of 28 billion yen ($342
million) for the year ending March 31, compared with a previous
estimate of a 4.5 billion yen profit and net income of 3.62
billion yen a year earlier. The company, in a statement to the
exchange on Oct. 8, maintained its full-year operating profit
forecast and revenue target of 450 billion yen.  The Tokyo-based company also plans to sell 30 billion yen
of preferred shares to Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. and 13 other
companies, according to a filing to Japan’s finance ministry.  Oki Electric will book a 22 billion yen charge to pay for
retirement benefits and 7 billion yen for job cuts. The company
also cut its current profit forecast by 2.5 billion yen to
reflect costs to issue preferred shares and for currency
fluctuations.  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley analyst  Masahiko Ishino  today
lowered his  rating  on Oki Electric to “underperform” from
“neutral,” a rating he had maintained since Sept. 21. Ishino
also cut the company’s 12-month share price estimate to 53 yen
from 70 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
