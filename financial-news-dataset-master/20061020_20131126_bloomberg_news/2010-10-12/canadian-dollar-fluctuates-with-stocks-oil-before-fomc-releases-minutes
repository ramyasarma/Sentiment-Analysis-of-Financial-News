Canada’s dollar appreciated versus
the greenback as the Federal Open Market Committee minutes
showed the central bank moved closer to further monetary easing
and global stocks rebounded from the day’s lows.  Canada’s currency strengthened toward a five-month high
versus the U.S. dollar, which has dropped against all of its 16
most-traded counterparts in October on speculation stepped-up
quantitative easing will debase the currency. Finance Minister
 Jim Flaherty  said the nation plans to be the first Group of
Seven country to balance its budget after the global financial
crisis.  “Any implication that the economy doesn’t need as much
additional quantitative easing as the market may now be pricing
in will be U.S. dollar positive, and Canadian dollar positive on
the crosses,”  Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist at Bank of
Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit in Toronto, said via e-mail.  “A key point is that FOMC members said the economy is
unlikely to re-enter recession, and growth is expected to pick
up gradually in 2011,” Tihanyi said. “That sounds a bit more
constructive. However, the foreign exchange market seems to be
selling the U.S. dollar right now.”  The currency rose 0.4 percent to C$1.0104 per U.S. dollar
at 4:16 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0139 yesterday, after
weakening as much as 0.4 percent. It reached C$1.0063 on Oct. 6,
the strongest since April 30. One Canadian dollar buys 98.99
U.S. cents.  Near Parity  The loonie reached parity with the greenback April 6 for
the first time since July 2008 based on the prospect of higher
interest rates and stronger economic growth than in the U.S. The
currency is up 4 percent versus the U.S. dollar this year, after
a 16 percent rise last year, as demand for the nation’s raw
materials recovered. Canada draws about half its export revenue
from commodities including oil, copper, lumber and wheat.  U.S. stocks reversed losses, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index up 0.4 percent after dropping as much as 0.8 percent.
Crude oil for November was down 47 cents at $81.74 a barrel in
New York, after falling as much as C$1.33.  Finance Minister Flaherty said Canada will eliminate its
record budget deficit by 2015.  The deficit for the 2009-10 fiscal year, which ended March
31, was raised to C$55.6 billion ($54.9 million), from the
original C$53.8 billion, Flaherty said in a mid-year review. The
cumulative deficit through 2014-15 will be C$6.8 billion more
than forecast in Flaherty’s March 4 budget.  Bond Yields  The yield on Canada’s five-year bonds rose two basis points
to 1.89 percent, after dropping two basis points to 1.85
percent, the lowest since April 2009. The price of the 3 percent
security due in December 2015 dropped 9 cents to C$105.42.  Traders are trimming bets that the Bank of Canada will
increase interest rates at its meeting on Oct. 19. Declines in
jobs and housing starts have made an increase less likely,
driving down the yield on the December bankers’ acceptance
contract, which fell to 1.30 percent today, matching the lowest
since Sept. 7, the day before the central bank raised its key
rate to 1 percent from 0.75 percent.  “It’s still a sell-U.S. dollar story,”  John Curran , a
senior vice president at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-
exchange dealer, said by phone from Toronto. “The Canadian
dollar has been doing a little bit better against the crosses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
