Australia’s worst-performing
mortgages are concentrated in the Sydney’s western and outer
south-western suburbs,  Moody’s Investors Service  found,
following research using a new method of analysis.  Moody’s has adopted an approach that moves away from
assessing performance by postcodes and uses “heat maps” to
identify regions with poorly performing mortgages, according to
a statement by the ratings company. It analyzed 750,000
mortgages belonging to Moody’s-rated residential mortgage-backed
securities in March.  Most of the poorest performers were in the Fairfield-
Liverpool area of the city’s western suburbs, and outer south-
western suburbs including Macquarie Fields, Minto and
Campbelltown, Arthur Karabatsos, head of structured finance
research for Moody’s in the Asia-Pacific region, said in the
statement.  The usual approach, in which mortgages are analyzed
according to postcodes, has “several well-known deficiencies,”
including the large number of postcodes -- some 6,500 -- which
observers outside the relevant areas find difficult to
understand, Karabatsos said.  The maps “revealed that the performances of mortgages
deteriorate generally as they radiate away from city centers,”
he said.  The new methodology divides Australia into 65 regions and
projects their performances onto the “heat maps.”  The analysis found the collateral performance of Melbourne
and Brisbane was strong, with mortgages in Melbourne doing
better than the national average, Karabatsos said. Three of the
10 best-performing regions were in Melbourne and surrounding
areas, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
