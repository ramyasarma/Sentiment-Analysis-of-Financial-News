The Australian dollar climbed to its
highest level since it began trading freely in 1983 as a gain in
global stocks encouraged demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie and New Zealand’s kiwi dollar rose against the
yen as reports showing a rebound in Australian consumer
confidence and an unexpected increase in Japanese machinery
orders buoyed optimism in the Asia-Pacific economy.  “Solid performance on the stock market spurs risk
sentiment,” said  Toshiya Yamauchi , a senior currency analyst at
Ueda Harlow Ltd. in Tokyo.  Australia’s currency climbed 0.6 percent to 99.25 U.S.
cents at 11:08 a.m. in New York, from 98.63 cents yesterday,
after touching a record 99.29 U.S. cents. The currency gained
0.7 percent to 81.14 yen, from 80.59. New Zealand’s dollar
appreciated 1 percent to 76.27 U.S. cents, from 75.52. It
advanced 1.1 percent to 62.36 yen, from 61.71 yen.  The sentiment index for Australia rose 3.3 percent to 117
this month, after a 5 percent drop in September, according to a
Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute survey of 1,200
consumers conducted Oct. 4-10 and released today in Sydney.  Japan’s  machine orders  rose 10.1 percent in August from
July, when they increased 8.8 percent, the Cabinet Office said
today in Tokyo. The median forecast of 28 economists  surveyed  by
Bloomberg News was for a 3.9 percent decrease.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.8 percent,
touching a five-month high as Intel Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. reported better-than-estimated results. Crude oil for
November delivery rose 1.8 percent to $83.10 a barrel.  Fed Speculation  The Aussie also advanced versus the greenback on mounting
expectations for additional purchases of debt by the Federal
Reserve, known as quantitative easing.  Policy makers “wanted to consider further the most
effective framework for calibrating and communicating any
additional steps to provide such stimulus,” the Fed said in
minutes of its Sept. 21 meeting, released yesterday in
Washington. The central bank also said for the first time that
it was considering targeting a path for the level of nominal
gross domestic product as a way to increase price expectations.  “The Fed was poised to restart quantitative easing,”
wrote  John Kyriakopoulos , head of currency strategy at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney, in a note to clients. “The top
end of our short-term model’s fair-value range for the AUD/USD
has risen to 1.0 for the first time since May 2008.”  Benchmark interest rates are 4.5 percent in  Australia  and 3
percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in  Japan 
and the U.S., attracting investors to the South Pacific nations’
higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that currency
market moves will erase profits.  Australian bonds fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-
year note rising 0.02 percentage point to 5 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate,
a fixed payment made to receive floating rates, rose 0.005
percentage point to 3.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
