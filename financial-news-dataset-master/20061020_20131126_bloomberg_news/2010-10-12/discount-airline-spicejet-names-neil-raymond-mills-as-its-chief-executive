SpiceJet Ltd. , an Indian discount
carrier backed by billionaire  Kalanithi Maran , named  Neil Raymond Mills  as its chief executive officer, according to a
statement on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.  Mills joins SpiceJet from Dubai-based low-fare airline
FlyDubai, where he was chief financial officer. His appointment
follows the departure of SpiceJet’s previous CEO  Sanjay Aggarwal ,
who joined as head of rival  Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.   SpiceJet, the only listed Indian carrier to post an annual
profit last fiscal year, said in July that it will buy 30 Boeing
Co. 737-800 aircraft. It currently operates 141 flights daily
with 22 planes.  Maran, chairman of Sun TV Network Ltd., bought a 38 percent
stake in SpiceJet in June from investors including Wilbur Ross.  SpiceJet, based in New Delhi, began flying international
routes from Oct. 7, connecting Nepal’s capital Kathmandu to New
Delhi and the southern Indian city of Chennai to Colombo, Sri
Lanka.  SpiceJet  rose 0.3 percent to 76.85 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close of trading in Mumbai. The shares have gained 40.2 percent
this year compared with a 16.5 percent advance in the benchmark
Sensitive Index and Kingfisher’s 29 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
