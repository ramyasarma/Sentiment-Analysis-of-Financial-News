A $152 million financing
package to renovate the 88-year-old  Rose Bowl Stadium  was
approved unanimously by city council members last night in
Pasadena, California.  The 89,000-seat stadium hosts college football’s
annual Rose Bowl game on New Year’s Day and the University
of California Los Angeles’s home football games. The arena
also has hosted five Super Bowl games and soccer events
during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.  UCLA and the  Tournament of Roses Association , a non-
profit organization that sponsors the Rose Bowl game and
parade, have agreed to continue their relationship with the
stadium until at least 2043, according to Ann Erdman, the
city’s public information officer.  Pasadena, a city of 143,000 located 10 miles northeast
of Los Angeles, will sell $130 million of bonds to fund the
construction and make up the difference with contributions
from city-related funds and the association, according to
an Oct. 11  report  by the city general manager and stadium
manager.  The renovations will increase the number of concession
stands by half, widen tunnels and add aisles for better
access and increase the number of premium seats to 2,500
from 600, according to Toby Zwikel, a spokesman for the
stadium. A video screen will be installed on the stadium’s
north side and a historic scoreboard reconstructed on the
south side.  Pasadena should proceed with the renovation now due to
low interest rates, the availability of federally
subsidized Build America Bond financing and a competitive
construction market, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
