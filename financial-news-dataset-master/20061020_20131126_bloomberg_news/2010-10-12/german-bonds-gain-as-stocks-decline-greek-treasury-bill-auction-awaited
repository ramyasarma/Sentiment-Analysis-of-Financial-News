German government bonds rose as
falling stock markets spurred demand for the safety of fixed-
income assets.  The advance pushed the yield on the 10-year bund down to
within one basis point of the  lowest  in more than five weeks.
Greek bonds gained after borrowing costs fell at a sale of 26-
week Treasury bills. Dutch 30-year bonds rallied after the
nation sold 1.8 billion euros ($2.5 billion) of 3.75 percent
2042 debt. The Stoxx Europe 600  Index  dropped 0.2 percent, while
the MSCI World  Index  fell 0.5 percent.  “Falling stocks are helping underpin the safety demand,
which is supporting bunds,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.  The yield on the German 10-year bond, Europe’s benchmark
security, fell three basis points to 2.24 percent at 4:01 p.m.
in London. It reached 2.21 percent earlier today. The 2.25
percent security due September 2020 rose 0.27, or 2.7 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 100.09. Two-year yields dropped two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.77 percent.  Greek 10-year government bonds rose versus benchmark German
bunds, narrowing the so-called yield spread by 16 basis points
to 684 basis points. That’s the lowest since June 21. The  Irish-
German yield spread  widened five basis points to 423 points. The
Portuguese-German spread rose 12 points to 399.  Greek bonds rallied for a second day after the
International Monetary Fund said it’s ready to give the nation
more time to repay loans. The 10-year yield tumbled yesterday by
the most since the European Union and IMF crafted a 750 billion-
euro aid package in May to backstop the euro. The yield dropped
50 basis points yesterday, narrowing the  yield spread  to bunds
to below 700 basis points for the first time since June 22.  Greek Sale  Greece sold the bills at an average yield on 4.54 percent
today, compared with 4.82 percent at a sale of similar-maturity
securities on Sept. 14, Greece’s Public Debt Management Agency
in Athens said. Investors bid for 4.22 times the securities
offered today, compared with 4.5 times at the last sale. The so-
called PDMA issued 1.17 billion euros of bills, more than the
900 million euros it indicated before the sale.  “Greek debt has continued to tighten as sentiment remains
positive,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole SA in London. “The Treasury bill auction came
at a lower yield and appeared well-bid. The results encouraged
further buying of Greek bonds.”  Dutch Auction  Dutch 30-year yields  fell four basis points to 2.95 percent
after the bond auction. The Netherlands sold the bonds at an
average yield of 2.91 percent, a spread of six basis points over
the German 4.75 percent bond maturing in July 2040, compared
with a spread of 14 basis points last time they sold the
securities on May 18.  German  inflation  accelerated to 1.3 percent in September
from 1 percent in August, the nation’s Federal Statistics Office
said today, confirming an earlier estimate.  German bonds have returned 2.1 percent since June 30,
compared with 3.2 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 3.8 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Greek bonds handed investors 10 percent during the period,
while Irish bonds lost 2.8 percent and Portuguese bonds 0.8
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
