Rubber advanced to the highest level
in more than five months, bolstered by a weakening yen and
supply concerns following heavy rain in key producer countries.
Shanghai rubber surged to the highest in more than four years.  Futures in Tokyo gained as much as 3 percent to 332.5 yen
per kilogram ($4,046 a metric ton), the highest level since
April 19, before settling at 328.2 yen. Shanghai futures soared
as much as 1.7 percent to 29,565 yuan a ton ($4,430), the
highest level since May 2006, after floods in China’s southern
island province of Hainan raised concerns that plantations may
have been damaged.  “The yen weakening against dollar is part of the reason
for bullish movement of Tocom rubber,” said  Ker Chung Yang ,
analyst at Phillip Futures Ltd. Heavy rainfall in Thailand and
Malaysia and floods in Hainan have disrupted production, Ker
said by phone today from Singapore.  Flooding in Hainan forced the evacuation of 440,000 people
and destroyed 3,000 houses, with more rain expected, Xinhua News
Agency reported today, citing Governor Luo Baoming. A total of
166,700 hectares of crops have been damaged, including 74,000
hectares destroyed, the news agency said.  The March-delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 0.9 percent to close at 29,335 yuan.  “Rainfalls continue in Thailand and the storm in China
damaged crops, raising concerns about supply availability,”
 Chaiwat Muenmee , an analyst at Bangkok-based commodity broker DS
Futures Co., said by phone today.  Supply Shortage  Cash prices in Thailand rose 2.6 percent today to 116.50
baht ($3.87) per kilogram as China, the largest buyer, continued
to purchase after the National Day holiday, according to the
Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  Rubber prices in Indonesia, the world’s second-largest
producer, surged to a record today at $3.85 a kilogram as heavy
rain disrupted tapping, lowering production, according to the
Rubber Association of Indonesia.  The price may advance to $4 a kilogram by the end of the
month because of a “supply shortage,” while domestic demand
keeps expanding,  Asril Sutan Amir , the association’s chairman,
said by phone today.  The Japanese currency weakened after the country’s Economy
Minister  Banri Kaieda  said today that rapid yen appreciation is
undesirable. The yen fell to 82.36 a dollar after yesterday
reaching 81.39 yen, the highest level since April 1995.  Japan will take “bold” measures on the yen and is ready
to intervene when needed, Kaieda told reporters in Tokyo. Japan
will also try to seek “understanding” from other countries
regarding efforts to stem the yen’s rise against other
currencies, Kaieda said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
