The San Francisco Giants rallied to
beat the Atlanta Braves 3-2 and advance to the National League
Championship Series for the first time since 2002.  San Francisco scored two runs in the seventh inning to
erase a 2-1 deficit after Braves starting pitcher Derek Lowe was
replaced with the bases loaded and one out. Cody Ross singled in
the go-ahead run after hitting a solo home run the previous
inning for the Giants’ first hit against Lowe.    The Giants’ win at Turner Field in Atlanta came one day
after they scored twice in the ninth inning to beat the Braves
by the same 3-2 score in Game 3.   San Francisco won the best-of-five division series 3-1 and
will face Philadelphia in the NL Championship Series starting
Oct. 16. The Phillies completed a sweep of the Cincinnati Reds
in the league’s other first-round series last night.  Giants starting pitcher Madison Bumgarner allowed two runs
on six hits with five strikeouts over six innings, while Lowe
allowed two runs on two hits over 6 1/3 innings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
