The cost of insuring against losses
on European corporate bonds rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 9 basis
points to 463, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 11 a.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings increased 2 basis points to 99.75,
JPMorgan prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from
default also rose, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers up 1.5 at 120.5 and the subordinated index
1.5 higher at 180.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
