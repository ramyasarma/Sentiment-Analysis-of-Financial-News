Terry Pilkadaris , the winner of
three  Asian Tour  tournaments, and four other golfers failed to
persuade a Singapore judge to temporarily lift a ban prohibiting
them from playing in events organized by a rival tour.  Asian Tour Ltd. fined the players $5,000 for each
tournament they played that was organized by rival OneAsia Tour.
The players were prohibited from playing in Asian Tour events
until the fines were paid.  “Sportsmen play by the rules,” Singapore High Court Judge
Choo Han Teck said in an Oct. 6  ruling  made public yesterday.
“The rules are clear and the majority of the players understand
and are abiding by them.”  Pilkadaris, Simon Yates, Matthew Griffin, Guido van der
Valk and Anis Hassan sued the Asian Tour, claiming the
prohibition against participating in events organized by rival
tours is an unreasonable restraint of trade. They sought to have
the ban lifted until their trial.  It’ll be up to a trial judge to determine the legality of
the association’s bylaws and lifting the ban at this time would
undermine the authority of the Asian Tour, Choo wrote.  The cases are Terry Pilkadaris v. Asian Tour (Tournament
Players Division) Pte S624/2010 and S551/2010 in the Singapore
High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
