The 2012 European Championship
soccer qualifier between Italy and Serbia was abandoned because
of crowd trouble.  Serbian fans threw flares onto the field in Genoa, Italy,
causing the stoppage after just six minutes, according to the
website of European soccer governing body UEFA. The match had
been delayed 35 minutes at the start by crowd disturbances, UEFA
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
