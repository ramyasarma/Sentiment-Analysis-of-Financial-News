Russia may raise its duty on regular
crude exports by as much as 9.6 percent and on exports with a
discounted rate by as much as 22 percent on Nov. 1 after Urals
prices rose.  The standard tax rate is likely to rise to $288.90 a metric
ton to $292.20 a ton from $266.50 a ton ($36.36 a barrel) in
October, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Finance
Ministry data. The discounted rate on oil pumped via Russia’s
East Siberian-Pacific Ocean pipeline to Asia may jump to $97.60
a ton to $99.90 a ton from $82.10 a ton.  Russia sets the duty based on the average Urals price from
the 15th day of each month to the 14th day of the next. Urals,
Russia’s benchmark export blend, may average from $79.74 to
$80.43 a barrel during the current monitoring period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today.  The export tax on light oil products may rise to $206.90 to
$209.20 a ton from $191.80. The duty on heavy products may
increase to $111.50 to $112.70 a ton from $103.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
