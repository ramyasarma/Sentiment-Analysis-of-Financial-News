Aluminum stockpiles in Japan
decreased 2.4 percent to 230,400 metric tons at the end of
September, trading company Marubeni Corp. said today.  Inventories held in Yokohama, Nagoya and Osaka ports fell
from 236,100 tons as of Aug. 31, according to Marubeni, Japan’s
largest importer of the metal used in cars and houses.  Inventories dropped to 169,900 tons in September last year,
the lowest level since Marubeni began compiling data in June
1995, after importers slashed the volume of purchases on
expectation that demand would weaken amid an economic slump.  A breakdown of the Japanese stockpiles data follows:  To contact the reporters on this story:
