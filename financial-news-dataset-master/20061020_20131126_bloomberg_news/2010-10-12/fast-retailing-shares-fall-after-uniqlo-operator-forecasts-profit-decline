Fast Retailing Co. , Asia’s biggest
clothing chain operator, fell the most in six months in Tokyo
trading after forecasting a 17 percent drop in profit on slowing
sales of its Uniqlo brand.  Fast Retailing  declined 9.8 percent, the biggest drop since
April 5, to 11,180 yen, at the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The stock, which has fallen 36 percent this year, is
the second-biggest  loser  among companies in the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average.  The retailer faces greater competition from domestic rivals
such as  Aeon Co. , which has introduced products similar to
Uniqlo’s Heattech thermal underwear range, and overseas chains
like Inditex SA’s Zara and Hennes & Mauritz AB’s H&M brands.
Fast Retailing is expanding in China and other markets to reduce
its reliance on Japan, where it generated 84 percent of sales
last year.  “Fast Retailing’s forecast was disappointing,”  Mitsuo Shimizu , a Tokyo-based analyst at Cosmo Securities Co., said by
phone. “Overseas operations aren’t big enough to make up for
slowing sales in Japan yet.”  Nomura Securities Co.  cut  its 12-month price target to
13,000 yen from 14,500 yen. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reduced its
target to 11,000 yen from 11,500 yen.  Net income for the 12 months ending in August will probably
fall to 51 billion yen ($620 million) from 61.7 billion yen last
year, the company  said  after the close of trading on Oct. 8.
 Sales  may rise 5 percent to 856 billion yen, the slowest pace of
growth in eight years. Japanese markets were closed yesterday
for a holiday.  Basic Lines  Uniqlo’s same-store sales in Japan may fall 4.7 percent
this fiscal year with a 9.8 percent drop in the first half, the
company said.  “We will strengthen our basic lines,” Chief Executive
Officer  Tadashi Yanai  said on Oct. 8. “We were driven by
‘surface fashion’ too much,” he said, referring to products
that have “a meaningless design such as a shirt with a frill
attached in a meaningless part.”  Fast Retailing  forecasts sales of Heattech apparel will
rise 40 percent to 70 million units in the current fiscal year.  The retailer, which began expanding abroad in 2001 by
entering the U.K. market, opened a Uniqlo outlet in New York’s
Soho district in 2006 and across the road from the Galeries
Lafayette department store in Paris last year. It also plans to
add a store on New York’s Fifth Avenue in the second half of
2011, it said.  Yanai , who is also the company’s biggest shareholder,
reiterated that he aims to increase Uniqlo stores in China to
1,000 within 10 years, from 54 outlets in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Naoko Fujimura  in Tokyo at
