The German billionaire Oetker family
would accept a minority stake in a combined lender formed of its
 Bankhaus Lampe  subsidiary and BHF-Bank AG, which  Deutsche Bank
AG  is selling,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing
unidentified people from the financial industry.  Oetker would like to merge the lenders and reduce its risk
toward the banking sector should a joint bid with Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. succeed, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
