Gold declined for the first time in
three days as a rebound by dollar curbed demand for the metal as
an alternative asset.  The greenback gained as much as 0.6 percent against a
basket of six major currencies. Before today, gold gained 8.7
percent in the past month, reaching a record $1,366 an ounce on
Oct. 7, as the dollar slumped 6.4 percent against the basket.  “The dollar trading higher against a handful of currencies
is causing short-term bearish momentum in gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. “It’s rational to expect a pullback after gold rallied
to a record.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $7.70, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1,346.70 at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal has gained 23 percent this year.  Assets  in exchange-traded products backed by gold declined
1.22 metric tons to 2,083.55 tons yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a
record 2,097.01 tons on Sept. 30 and are up 16 percent this
year.  “The pace of buying has slowed,” analysts at
ScotiaMocatta said in a report. “With the market so dependent
on investors’ off-take to balance the market now that jewelry
demand is weak, there is a danger that surplus gold could sit
heavily on the market.”  The metal has outperformed stocks, bonds and some
industrial commodities. Gold may gain to $1,400 in three months,
$1,525 in six months and $1,650 in 12 months, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. analysts  David Greely  and  Damien Courvalin  said in a
report dated yesterday.  HSBC Outlook  Gold should account for 15 percent of a portfolio on a
three-year view and 13 percent on a six-month view,  Fredrik Nerbrand , the global head of asset allocation at HSBC Bank Plc,
said in a report today.  The metal is “not merely a hedge against inflation but one
of the few assets that hedges” against financial turmoil,
Nerbrand said. “The fact that gold is still under-owned and
opportunity costs are still low should boost investor appetite
further.”  Silver futures for December delivery fell 20.2 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $23.147 an ounce. Yesterday, the price reached
$23.675, the highest level since 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery dropped $7.50, or 0.4
percent, to $1,683.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery fell $8.10, or 1.4
percent, to $580.65 an ounce. Last week, the metal reached a
nine-year high of $606.25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
