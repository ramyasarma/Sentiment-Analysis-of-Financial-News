Samsung Electronics Co.  will delay
the introduction of its Galaxy Tab tablet computer in South
Korea to equip the device with better localized applications for
the domestic market, the company said.  Samsung will push back its initial plan to show the product
to the local media on Oct. 14, the Suwon, South Korea-based
company said in a statement today, without giving a new date for
the event.  Asia’s biggest maker of semiconductors, flat screens and
mobile phones unveiled the Galaxy Tab in September to compete
with Apple Inc.’s iPad, and tap the growing demand for such
handheld devices. Sales of tablet computers could reach 16
million units this year and 35 million in 2011, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said in a report last month.  Samsung, which planned to start selling the Galaxy Tab
through  SK Telecom Co.  in October, is still negotiating with the
carrier on pricing,  James Chung , a Samsung spokesman, said by
phone.  Apple yesterday submitted an application to receive a
technical certification on the iPad, a process to get approval
to sell the devices in South Korea, the Korea Communications
Commission said in a statement today. The iPad will be sold
through  KT Corp. , the nation’s sole provider of the iPhone.  LG Electronics Inc., which planned to enter the tablet-
computer market this year, may delay the plan until next year as
the company’s working on software for the device, an LG official
said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
