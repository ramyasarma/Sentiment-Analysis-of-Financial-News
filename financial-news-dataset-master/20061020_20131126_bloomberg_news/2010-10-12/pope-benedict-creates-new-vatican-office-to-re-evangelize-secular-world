Pope Benedict XVI  created a new
Vatican department aimed at “re-evangelizing” the most secular
regions of the globe, including areas of Europe that have become
“de-Christianized.”  Benedict issued a papal decree today launching the
Pontifical Council for the New Evangelization, which will seek
to bring Christianity to those whose spiritual lives have become
an “interior desert” amid technological and scientific changes
in recent decades, according to the  document .  While technology has also brought benefits to humanity,
there has been a “worrisome loss of any sense of the sacred,”
the pope said in the document.  Benedict, the leader of the world’s estimated 1 billion
Catholics, has made fighting loss of faith a key theme of his
papacy. He criticized “aggressive forms of secularism” during
a U.K. trip last month, and called on Europeans “to rediscover
the reasons for faith and hope” last year when he visited the
Czech Republic, where religious practice is among the lowest in
the 27-nation European Union.  The new Vatican office will employ “all the progress of
the science of communications” in a bid to restore religion to
the secular world. “My first concern is to get a computer on my
desk so that I can have Internet access,” Monsignor  Rino
Fisichella , the head of the new office, said at a Vatican
briefing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
