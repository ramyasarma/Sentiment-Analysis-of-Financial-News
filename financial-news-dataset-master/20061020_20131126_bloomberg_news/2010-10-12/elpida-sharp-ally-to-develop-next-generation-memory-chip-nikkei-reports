Elpida Memory Inc. and Sharp Corp.
will work together to develop a next-generation memory chip to
be sold around 2013, Nikkei English News said, without saying
where it obtained the information.  Called resistive random access memory, or ReRAM, the chip
may be able to write data 10,000 times faster than NAND flash
memory while consuming less power, Nikkei said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
