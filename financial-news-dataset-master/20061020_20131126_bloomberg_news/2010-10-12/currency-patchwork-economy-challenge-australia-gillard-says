Australia’s rising currency is
hurting exporters and farmers, and the economy must broaden
beyond mining as part of a plan to grow without putting more
pressure on interest rates, Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said.  “The upward pressure on our currency makes life even
harder for exporters of services and manufactured and farm
goods,” Gillard said in a speech in Brisbane today. In-bound
tourism needs government support, while consumers are reaping
benefits from the Australian dollar’s strength, Gillard added.  The currency reached 99.18 U.S. cents on Oct. 7, the
highest level since exchange controls were removed in 1983,
sparking a warning from Treasurer  Wayne Swan  on Oct. 10 that tax
revenue could fall as company profits earned offshore are eroded.
The so-called Aussie traded at 97.93 U.S. cents as of 4:31 p.m.
Sydney time today.  The economy should be broadly based to include an expansion
in services, manufacturing and agriculture, so that growth can
be sustained in the years ahead “without putting upward
pressure on inflation and interest rates,” Gillard said.  The economy’s dependence on commodities needs to be reduced
to broaden a “patchwork economy” where regions exposed to
mining are booming while others go backwards, she added.  Australia’s mining industry is helping to keep the nation’s
unemployment rate about half the levels in the U.S. and Europe
as Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd. increase shipments to
China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
