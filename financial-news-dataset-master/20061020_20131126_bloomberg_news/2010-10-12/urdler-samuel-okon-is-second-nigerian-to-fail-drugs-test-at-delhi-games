A second Nigerian track athlete has
failed a doping test at New Delhi’s Commonwealth Games,
organizers said today.  Samuel Okon, who came sixth in the 110-meter hurdles final,
tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine,
 Games Federation  Michael Fennell said at a press conference in
New Delhi. The same compound was detected in the ‘A’ sample
given by Okon’s compatriot Osayemi Oludamola, who was awarded
the gold medal in the women’s 100-meter sprint after the
original winner was disqualified.  “We have had a second anti-doping violation” among the
1,200 tests carried out so far during the Oct. 3-14  multisport
event , Fennell said. A provisional hearing into the case will be
held later today, he said.  Oludamola is awaiting the result of her ‘B’ sample, and has
not yet been stripped of her medal. She finished second in on
Oct. 7, though was awarded gold when Australia’s Sally Pearson
was belatedly eliminated for a false start. Methylhexaneamine is
on the  World Anti-Doping Agency’s  banned list for 2010.  “We are concerned by the number of incidents that have
cropped up with this same substance,” Fennell said, adding that
the Nigerian team is conducting its own investigation.  Seventy-one countries and territories, most former British
colonies, are taking part in the games, which are held every
four years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
