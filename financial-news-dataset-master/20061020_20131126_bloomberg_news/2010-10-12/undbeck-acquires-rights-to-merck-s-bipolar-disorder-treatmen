H. Lundbeck A/S , the Danish
drugmaker looking for replacements for its blockbuster
antidepressant Lexapro, agreed to buy the rights to sell  Merck &
Co Inc .’s bipolar disorder treatment Sycrest.  Lundbeck may sell the drug in all markets outside of the
U.S., China and Japan, under today’s agreement. The Valby,
Denmark-based company, which didn’t disclose how much it will
pay Merck for the rights, said it expects to begin selling the
medicine in the European Union at the start of next year.  Lundbeck, which last month fired 50 people at its Danish
and U.S. research centers, needs to  replace sales  that will be
lost when Lexapro loses U.S. patent protection in 2012. Last
week, the Danish drugmaker signed an exclusive agreement with
 Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.  for rights to the Tokyo-based
company’s experimental drug to treat Parkinson’s disease and
other central nervous system ailments.  Lundbeck will pay Merck a fee and product supply payments
for Sycrest, which the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based
company already has begun selling in the U.S. under the brand
name Saphris. European regulators approved the medicine on Sept.
1 to treat manic episodes in adults with bipolar disorder.  Lundbeck rose as much as 1.1 percent in Copenhagen trading
after losing as much as 1.4 percent before the announcement. The
shares rose 0.90 krone, or 0.9 percent, to 100.50 kroner at
11:57 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
