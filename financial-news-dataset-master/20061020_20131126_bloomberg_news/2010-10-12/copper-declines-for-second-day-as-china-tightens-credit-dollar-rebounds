Copper dropped in London, Shanghai
and New York on the prospect of further credit tightening in
China, the world’s largest user, and as the dollar rebounded.  Three-month delivery copper fell for a second day, by as
much as 0.6 percent, to $8,242 a metric ton and traded at $8,245
by 10:18 a.m. in Singapore. The metal’s climb to a 27-month high
of $8,388 a ton yesterday was deemed excessive after China
raised the reserve requirements for the nation’s six largest
banks, according to Beijing Capital Futures Co.  “The news about the reserve ratio hike is weighing on
sentiment and while it may not have much of an impact, it renews
concerns about interest rate hikes ahead,” said Beijing
Capital’s analyst Xiao Jing. “The slight bounce in the dollar
today is also pressuring commodities lower.”  January-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost as much as 1.4 percent to 62,120 yuan ($9,308) a ton,
before trading at 62,330 yuan. Futures for December delivery on
the Comex in New York dropped as much as 0.9 percent to $3.7535
a pound.  The  dollar  rose for a second day against a six-currency
basket before the release of the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 21
policy meeting minutes today. The central bank said at that
meeting it was willing to ease monetary policy further.  Among other LME-traded metals, aluminum fell 0.5 percent to
$2,389 a ton, zinc dropped 0.3 percent to $2,324 a ton, lead
declined 0.9 percent to $2,295 a ton, and nickel lost 0.5
percent to $24,200 a ton. Tin hadn’t traded by 10:20 a.m. in
Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
