Corinthian Colleges  Inc. said
President and Chief Operating Officer  Matt Ouimet  will resign,
sending the education company’s shares down as much as 8.1
percent.  The resignation is effective Oct. 31, and there are no
immediate plans to fill the post, the Santa Ana, California-
based company said in a statement today.  The U.S. Senate has held hearings on whether for-profit
colleges, which got $26.5 billion in U.S. government aid last
year, misled students on their employment prospects after
graduation. Iowa Democratic Senator  Tom Harkin , chairman of
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, said Sept. 30
that he will explore “legislative changes” for the industry.  “For someone in senior management to be leaving the
company at such a sensitive time (and with the stock at such
depressed levels) is obviously not good and suggests he lacked
faith in his future at the firm,” said  Trace Urdan , an analyst
with Signal Hill Capital Group, in an e-mail. Urdan rates
Corinthian shares a “buy.”  Ouimet, 52, joined Corinthian in January 2009, the college
said. He came to the education company after holding executive
positions at  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc . and the
 Walt Disney Co.   Corinthian fell 43 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $5.90 at 4
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading,
after earlier dropping to as low as $5.82. The company lost 65
percent in the 12 months before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
