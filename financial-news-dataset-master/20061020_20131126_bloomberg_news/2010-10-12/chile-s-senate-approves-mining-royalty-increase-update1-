Chile’s Senate  approved  a government
proposal to raise taxes for mining companies including  BHP
Billiton Ltd.  and  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc .  Lawmakers voted 26 in favor and one against, while three
abstained, according to images transmitted by the Senate
television channel. The lower house must vote on the revised
bill before it becomes law.  The changes would raise about $1 billion over three years
to help fund earthquake reconstruction and President  Sebastian Pinera ’s education and health programs, Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  said in an Oct. 6 statement. Congress failed to agree on
a similar proposal in July.  Under terms of the bill, companies would opt to transfer
from today’s fixed rate of 4 percent or 5 percent of operating
profit to a sliding scale of 4 percent to 9 percent through
2012. They would return to a fixed rate of 4 percent or 5
percent from 2013 to 2017 and move to a sliding scale of 5
percent to 14 percent through 2023.  The lower house approved an earlier version of the bill on
Sept. 15 that called for a sliding scale of 5 percent to 9
percent through 2025. The government changed the bill on Oct. 6
after negotiating an agreement with the opposition, which holds
a majority in the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
