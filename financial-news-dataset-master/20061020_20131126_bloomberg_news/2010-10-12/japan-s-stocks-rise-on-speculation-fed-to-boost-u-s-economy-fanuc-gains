Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropping the most in a month. Carmakers
slid on speculation the yen will remain strong against the
dollar as the U.S. Federal Reserve eases monetary policy.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s largest carmaker, lost 1.5
percent. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, sank
2 percent. Fast Retailing Co. tumbled 10 percent after
forecasting a profit drop. Oki Electric Industry Co., a maker of
communications equipment, plunged 16 percent after forecasting a
loss and saying it will sell 30 billion yen ($365 million) in
preferred shares.  The Nikkei 225 lost 2.1 percent to 9,388.64 at the 3 p.m.
market close in Tokyo, the biggest decline since Sept. 8. The
 Topix  index fell 1.8 percent to 824.60, with about 20 stocks
retreating for each that rose. Japan’s markets were shut
yesterday for a national holiday.  “The consensus is that the U.S. will further ease monetary
policy and the dollar will remain weak,” said  Masaru Hamasaki ,
who helps oversee about $17 billion as chief strategist at
Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Concerns about Japanese
corporate earnings are getting stronger because of the
currency’s appreciation.”  The Topix has declined 9.1 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 4.5 percent by the  S&P 500  and 3.7 percent by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
14.7 times estimated  earnings , compared with 13.9 times for the
S&P and 12.1 times for the Stoxx.  Monetary Easing  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped 0.7
percent. In New York, the index climbed less than 0.1 percent to
1,165.3 yesterday as trading volume sank to the lowest level of
the year amid growing speculation the Federal Reserve will pump
more cash into the economy to protect the recovery after
payrolls declined more than expected.  The Labor Department said on Oct. 8 that U.S. payrolls fell
by 95,000 workers after a revised 57,000 decrease in August.
Companies added 64,000 jobs, less than forecast, while the
unemployment rate held at 9.6 percent.  “Providing liquidity itself is good for the market, but
that leads to a decline in the currency, so the dollar will
continue to weaken,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co.  Automakers were the  heaviest drag  on the Topix. Toyota fell
1.5 percent to 2,851 yen. Honda sank 2 percent to 2,930 yen.
Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest carmaker, dropped 1.8
percent to 727 yen.  Yen Advances  The dollar dropped to 81.39 yen yesterday, the lowest level
since April 1995. The U.S. currency fell to as low as 81.81 yen
today, compared with 82.37 at the close of stock trading in
Tokyo on Oct. 8.  Fast Retailing , which operates the Uniqlo casual clothing
chain, slumped 10 percent to 11,180 yen and was the heaviest
drag on the Nikkei. The company forecast full-year profit will
fall 17 percent to 51 billion yen because same-store sales
declined in the first half.  Brokerages including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup
Global Markets Japan Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. cut their
 share price estimates  on Fast Retailing.  Oki Electric, which makes personal computers and automated
teller machines, plunged 16 percent to 62 yen, the sharpest
slide since at least September 1974. It plans to sell 30 billion
yen in preferred shares, according to a filing with Japan’s
finance ministry.  Oki, Tepco Tumbles  Oki reversed its full-year  forecast  to a net loss of 28
billion yen from a 4.5 billion yen profit, citing costs to issue
preferred shares and a one-time charge related to an early
retirement program.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. , Asia’s biggest utility, sank 4.5
percent to 1,900 yen, a level not seen since May 1985, as
investors anticipated the price of a new share offering. The
company, also known as Tepco, said on Sept. 29 that it plans to
raise up to 555 billion yen through a share sale and will set
the offering price sometime between Oct. 12 and Oct. 14.  The Osaka Securities Exchange’s Jasdaq market and Hercules
market integrated today. Transaction Co., a maker of household
and health-care goods, traded at 1,013 yen on its debut on the
bourse, down 28 percent from the initial public offering price
of 1,400 yen.  -- With assistance from  Norie Kuboyama  in Tokyo. Editor:  Sam Waite ,  Nick Gentle .  To contact the reporter for this story:
