Punch Taverns Plc , a U.K. pub
operator, said its full-year loss narrowed as the company took
smaller impairment charges on the value of its pubs.  The net loss was 159.9 million pounds ($253.8 million), or
24.8 pence per share, in the year ended Aug. 21, compared with a
loss of 176.4 million pounds, or 56.1 pence per share, a year
earlier, the Burton-on-Trent, England-based company said in a
statement today on Regulatory News Service.  Punch has been selling pubs to reduce debt, and
refurbishing others. The outlets are worth less as Britain
recovers from recession and as U.K. alcohol consumption declines
and customers increasingly drink at home.  “While we have been encouraged by more recent trends in
both the leased and managed businesses, the economic environment
is very difficult and there remains room for improvement across
all aspects of our business,” Chief Executive Officer  Ian Dyson 
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
