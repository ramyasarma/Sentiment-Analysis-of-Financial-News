Citigroup Inc.  sold $3 million of
six-month notes linked to the debt of Ghana, paying a coupon of
10.75 percent.  The notes use income from the west African country’s debt
denominated in cedi, and pay coupons and principal in dollars,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The exchange rate is
fixed at 1.42 cedi per dollar, compared with 1.4325 today,
Bloomberg composite prices show. The securities were issued at a
price of 100 percent of face value.  Credit-linked notes are tied to the creditworthiness of a
company or country, paying interest based on the income from the
debt of the borrower they reference. They are usually sold to
investors who might have difficulty accessing the underlying
bonds for taxation or cost reasons.  Ghana is rated B by Standard & Poor’s, five levels below
investment-grade status, and one step higher at B+ by Fitch
Ratings. Investors face losing money on the securities if the
country defaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
