China’s stocks entered a so-called
bull market today as the nation’s economic growth outlook and
prospects for faster currency appreciation spurred a 20 percent
rebound for the benchmark index from this year’s low.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose from the 2010 low on July
5, surpassing the 20 percent threshold some investors consider
as the beginning of a bull market. It entered a bear market in
May after the government introduced measures to rein in real-
estate prices and cut the annual new lending target by 22
percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
