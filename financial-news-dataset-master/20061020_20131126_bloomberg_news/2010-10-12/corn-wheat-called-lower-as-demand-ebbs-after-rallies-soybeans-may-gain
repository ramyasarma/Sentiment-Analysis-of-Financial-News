What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 1 cent a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand slows after prices
rose 12 percent in the past two sessions, reaching a two-year
high, said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as rains may aid soil moisture for planting in
Russia and a rally that sent prices up 47 percent since the end
of June slows demand, Henderson said.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago as Chinese imports rise and dry weather delays
planting in parts of South America, Henderson said. Soybean-meal
futures may open steady to $1 higher per 2,000 pounds, and
soybean oil is called to open steady to up 0.1 cent a pound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
