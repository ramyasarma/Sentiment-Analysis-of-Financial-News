Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  was upgraded to
“buy” from “hold” at Societe Generale SA.  The brokerage
downgraded both  Banco Popolare SC  and  UniCredit SpA  to “sell.”  Societe Generale said in a note today that “over the last
five years, Italian bank management teams have had a poor track
record generating value creation relative to the European banks
sector, with only Intesa’s management having created any value
on a relative basis for shareholders.”  Banco Popolare and UniCredit were previously rated “buy”
and “hold,” respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
