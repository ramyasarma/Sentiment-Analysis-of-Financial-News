The German government confirmed that
two German nationals were detained in Iran and said it is
seeking clarification of the circumstances behind the arrests.  The German Embassy has sent a team to the northwestern city
of Tabriz where the Germans were arrested to seek access to the
two, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Westerwelle said he spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki in New York yesterday and asked him
personally to look into the case.  “We have a clear goal: to get the two German citizens back
to Germany as quickly as possible,” Westerwelle said. “We’re
working as hard as we can at all diplomatic levels to achieve
that aim.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
