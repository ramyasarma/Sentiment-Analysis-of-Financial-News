Giuseppe Mussari , chairman of
Italy’s banks association  ABI , said the lobby is concerned that
Basel III rules won’t be implemented by U.S. banks, speaking in
Rome today.  “There are banks, which were not responsible for the
disaster, that are told to be regulated with stricter rules
while their competitors in the U.S. don’t implement the same
rules,” Mussari said. Basel III rules “don’t address the
issue” of excessive leverage, Mussari said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
