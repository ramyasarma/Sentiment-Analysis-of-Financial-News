Bank Pocztowy SA wants to delay its
initial public offering by about six months after publishing
2011 first-half results,  rp.pl  reported, citing Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Szymon Midera.  The Polish state-controlled lender earlier planned to
publish a prospectus in July 2011, Pocztowy said on its website.
The bank wants to raise as much as 350 million zloty ($122
million) and plans to pick an adviser for the IPO by the end of
the year, rp.pl added.  Poczta Polska SA, the Polish state-owned postal company,
owns 75 percent of Pocztowy, and  PKO Bank Polski SA , Poland’s
biggest bank, owns 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
