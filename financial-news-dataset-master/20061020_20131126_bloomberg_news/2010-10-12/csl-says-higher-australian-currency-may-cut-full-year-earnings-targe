CSL Ltd. , the world’s second-biggest
maker of blood-derived medical treatments, said full-year profit
may fall more than forecast as the Australian dollar strengthens
to near a record against the U.S. currency.  Net income may drop to between A$880 million ($867 million)
and A$940 million in the 12 months ending June, based on the
Australian currency’s Oct. 8 exchange rate, Melbourne-based CSL
said today. The Australian dollar traded at 98.5 U.S. cents on
Oct. 8 after reaching a record 99.18 U.S. cents a day earlier.  CSL said in August that profit may decline as much as 6.9
percent to between A$980 million and A$1.03 billion, using
exchange rates for the year ended June 30. The company, which
gets more than  85 percent  of sales in foreign currencies, said
every 1 percent gain in the Aussie against the U.S. dollar would
wipe A$1.9 million from profit and a 1 percent advance versus
the euro would cut A$3.9 million.  The shares  rose  0.2 percent to A$32.27 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney trading. The Australian dollar was at 98.57 U.S.
cents as of 4:26 p.m. in Sydney.  CSL and its larger rival,  Baxter International Inc.  of
Deerfield, Illinois, derive products from blood plasma, the
watery liquid in which blood cells are suspended, to treat
immune deficiency disorders, hemophilia, wounds and burns.  The Australian company was founded in 1916 as Commonwealth
Serum Laboratories, a government-owned provider of vaccines. It
began trading on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
