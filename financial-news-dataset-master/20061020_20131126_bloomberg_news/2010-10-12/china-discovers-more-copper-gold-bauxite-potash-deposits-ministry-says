China, the world’s largest metals
consumer, discovered additional copper, bauxite, gold and
potash deposits as the country strives to meet surging demand
for natural resources.  Exploration uncovered 38.5 million metric tons of copper
resources, 449 million tons of bauxite resources, 1,830 tons of
gold resources, and 468 million tons of potash resources, the
Ministry of Land and Resources said in a  statement  dated Oct. 9
on its website.  China has been working to reduce its reliance on mineral
imports as rising commodity prices have put companies under
financial pressure. The country has also tried to acquire
overseas resources to secure supplies.  The newly discovered potash in Xinjiang has been quickly
extracted and processed, increasing the country’s self-reliance
on the crop nutrient, the statement said.  The ministry said at the beginning of this year it had
discovered 20 million tons of copper resources, and 255 tons of
gold deposits, in an effort to exploit domestic natural
deposits. The latest report offered no reason for the increase.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Richard Dobson, Jake Lloyd-Smith.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
