India’s benchmark stock index fell
after industrial production grew at a slower pace than
economists’ estimated.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , the largest engineering company,
dropped the most in more than two weeks.  Output  at factories,
utilities and mines rose 5.6 percent from a year earlier in
August, the statistics office said in a statement today. The
median estimate of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 9.5 percent gain.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. , the
biggest power-equipment maker, retreated for the fourth day.  “Things are not moving ahead as per expectations,” said
 Aneesh Srivastava , the Mumbai-based chief investment officer at
IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co., who manages about $325 million
in assets. “It’s a cause for concern.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
lost 136.55, or 0.7 percent, to 20,203.34 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The gauge has gained 26 percent from the May 25
low, approaching the record closing high of 20,873.33 on Jan. 8,
2008. The measure is the best performer this year among the
world’s 10 biggest stock markets after climbing 12 percent last
month, the most since May 2009.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
dropped 0.7 percent to 6,090.90. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.8
percent to 2,573.75.  Slower Output  Larsen & Toubro lost 1.9 percent to 1,999.5 rupees, the
most since Sept. 22. Bharat Heavy decreased 1.2 percent to
2,543.55 rupees. August’s growth in factory output was the
slowest since May 2009 and follows a 15.2 percent increase in
July. India’s Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said he was
“disappointed” with the pace.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer,
declined 2.1 percent to 210.7 rupees as commodity prices slid in
London, Shanghai and New York on the prospect of further credit
tightening in China, the world’s largest user.  The London Metal Exchange index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 0.2 percent
yesterday.  Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest producer of the alloy,
fell 1.1 percent to 633.35 rupees.  Housing Development Finance Corp. , the nation’s largest
mortgage lender, lost 1.8 percent 708.05 rupees. The shares have
climbed 36 percent since May 25 and are trading at 30.9 times
estimated earnings, compared with 19.1 times for the Sensex.  Lacking Confidence  “Investors don’t have the confidence that there can be
further gains after the recent rally,” said  Kishor Ostwal ,
managing director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a publicly
traded equities research provider in Mumbai. “Some investors
are taking some money off the table.”  Cantabil Retail India Ltd. , a clothing company, fell below
its offer price in its trading debut today. The shares dropped
22 percent to 105 rupees. The company sold shares at 135 rupees
each in an initial public offering last month.  Overseas  funds  bought a net  8.08 billion rupees  ($182
million) of Indian equities on Oct. 8 for the 28th straight day,
extending this year’s record inflows to 987.6 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
