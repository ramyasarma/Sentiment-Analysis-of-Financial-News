A group of former Chinese officials
has called on the government to end media censorship in an open

“scandal,” the Morning Post reported. Signatories of the
letter include Li Rui, former deputy head of the Chinese
Communist Party’s organisation department and an ex-secretary
for Mao Zedong; and Hu Jiwei, former editor-in-chief of the
People’s Daily, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
