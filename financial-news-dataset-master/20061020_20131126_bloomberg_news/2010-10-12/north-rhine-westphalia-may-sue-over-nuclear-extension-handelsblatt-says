The German state of North Rhine-
Westphalia may resort to legal means over Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s plan to extend operating licenses for some of the
country’s nuclear power plants,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an
interview with a state minister.  North Rhine-Westphalia opposes the German government’s plan
to enforce extension of the licenses without involving the upper
house of parliament, where German state governments are
represented, the state’s economy and energy minister  Harry Voigtsberger  was quoted as  saying . If the government sticks to
its plan to circumvent the upper house “then we’ll go to law,”
Voigtsberger said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
