The U.S. has lifted its moratorium
on deep-water offshore oil drilling, Interior Secretary  Kenneth Salazar  told the New Orleans judge weighing a challenge to the
ban.  U.S. regulators imposed the moratorium on drilling in
waters deeper than 500 feet on July 12, to replace an earlier
ban struck down by U.S. District Judge  Martin Feldman  in New
Orleans. Feldman reversed the earlier ban, imposed after the  BP
Plc  oil spill, as too broad.  Offshore service companies challenged the second moratorium
as well, in a lawsuit pending before Feldman. The U.S. earlier
asked Feldman to reject this lawsuit, calling the ban a matter
of public policy.  The U.S. is ending “the suspension on all deep-water
drilling effective immediately,” Salazar said in a filing today
in Feldman’s court. “This new decision memorandum may be
relevant to the court’s consideration” of the U.S. request to
dismiss the lawsuit, lawyers for Salazar said.  The case is Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-1941,
Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
