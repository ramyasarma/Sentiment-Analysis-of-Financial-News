Tullett Prebon Plc , the London-based
interdealer broker, said four-month sales fell 3 percent as
brokers in North America quit to join rival BGC Partners Inc.  Revenue  in the months of July to October fell to 292
million pounds ($469 million), the company said in a statement
today. It didn’t give a comparable year-earlier figure.  Tullett sued three executives affiliated with rival BGC
Partners Inc. in August in New York, alleging they helped plot
the hiring of 77 of its staffers. Tullet and units have sued
rivals at least four times seeking damages for poaching
employees.  “Market activity in the period since the half year has
been relatively subdued without any sustained periods of higher
volatility,” the company said in the statement. The drop in
revenue reflects “the net effect of the broker defections in
North America following the raid by BGC in the second half of
last year.”  Tullett fell 7 percent in London trading yesterday to 369
pence, giving the broker a market value of about 795 million
pounds. The shares have risen 32 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
