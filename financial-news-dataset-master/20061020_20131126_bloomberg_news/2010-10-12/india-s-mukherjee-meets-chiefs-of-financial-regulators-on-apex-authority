India’s Finance Minister Pranab
Mukherjee today held talks with the heads of the central bank
and market and insurance regulators to set up an apex body to
coordinate the work of the authorities and oversee large finance
companies, the government said in a statement.  The super regulator, known as the Financial Stability and
Development Council, was announced by Mukherjee in his Feb. 26
budget speech.  The council “would engage in macro prudential supervision
of the economy, including the functioning of large financial
conglomerates and address inter-regulatory coordination
issues,” the finance ministry statement said. “It will also
focus on financial literacy and financial inclusion.”  The council will have a sub-committee headed by the
governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the statement said,
following Mukherjee’s meeting with central bank Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao, C.B. Bhave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Board of India and Insurance Regulatory and Development
Authority Chairman J. Harinarayan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
