Italy may start withdrawing its
troops from Afghanistan in the summer of 2011 as allied forces
hand over control of some of the country’s provinces to local
authorities, la Repubblica reported, citing an interview with
Foreign Minister  Franco Frattini .  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s leaders will
discuss at a meeting next month “the priority for the provinces
that will return to national control,” Frattini told the Rome-
based newspaper. “Italy is also thinking about the withdrawal
of its troops, but this has to take place at the right time in
total coordination with its allies,” Frattini said.  Four Italian soldiers were killed and one was seriously
injured in Afghanistan when a bomb blew up their vehicle near
Farah in western Afghanistan on Oct. 9. Italy has about 3,150
soldiers in NATO’s Afghanistan mission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
