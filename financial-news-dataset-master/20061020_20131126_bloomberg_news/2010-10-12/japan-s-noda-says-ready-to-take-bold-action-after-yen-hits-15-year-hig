Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said the government remains ready to take “bold” action
including currency intervention after the yen rose to its 
highest level since 1995 against the dollar.  “We will watch currencies with great interest and will take
bold action, which includes intervention, if needed,” Noda said
at a press conference in Tokyo today.  Group of Seven finance chiefs this weekend warned that a
currency “war” caused by countries’ efforts to boost exports
by embracing weaker currencies could hobble world growth. The
prospect of a slower U.S. expansion and further easing by the
Federal Reserve pushed the dollar to a 15-year low against the
yen yesterday.  Noda later said in parliament that the Group of 20 will
discuss how to respond to pressure among governments to compete
to devalue currencies when they meet later this month after G-7
members failed to reach a conclusion on the topic.  Japan’s currency rose as high as 81.39 yesterday and has
risen more than 13 percent against the dollar this year. It
traded at 82.23 as of 9:54 a.m.  Economy Minister  Banri Kaieda  said at a separate press
conference in Tokyo today that an abrupt strengthening of the
yen can hurt the nation’s recovery and there is no change in the
government’s stance to take decisive measures when necessary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
