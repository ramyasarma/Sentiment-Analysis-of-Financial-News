Investments in wind power may reach
$202 billion, with the energy source expected to account for 22
percent of the world’s electricity demand within two decades,
the Global Wind Energy Council said.  Installed wind capacity may rise to 2,300 gigawatts by
2030, the industry group said today in a  report  released with
environment group Greenpeace. Construction of turbines is
growing faster than previous “advanced” scenarios, they said.  Last year, $63 billion was invested, adding 37.5 gigawatts
of capacity and bringing potential output of electricity from
wind to 157.9 gigawatts, according to the Brussels-based
industry group. A third of those turbines were installed in
China, which doubled its capacity to 25 gigawatts.  A wind turbine is being erected every 30 minutes in 75
countries around the world by about 600,000 workers at companies
such as General Electric Co., Siemens AG and  Vestas Wind Systems
A/S . Investments in wind power last year exceeded money spent on
all other energy technologies, according to the International
Energy Agency.  The world will have saved 34 billion tons of carbon dioxide
by 2030 as wind capacity reaches 2,300 gigawatts, the council
also said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
