Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans this month rose
relative to Chicago futures as farmers withheld crops on
speculation that shrinking inventories will lift prices.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
October rose to 51 cents to 52 cents a bushel above December
futures, compared with 49 cents to 52 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. Soybean premiums increased
to 55 cents to 60 cents above November futures from 51 cents to
60 cents.  “The crops are smaller, and the flow of grain from farmers
has been reduced,” said  Scott Stoller , a grain merchandiser for
Michlig Agricenter Inc. in Manlius, Illinois. “The farmer is
shell-shocked by the rally in prices and the lower yields this
year.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 23.25 cents, or 4.2
percent, to close at $5.79 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of trade, capping a 19 percent rally over the past four
sessions. Earlier, the price touched $5.8425, the highest level
since August 2008.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 26 cents, or 2.3
percent, to close at $11.785 a bushel in Chicago, bringing the
gain over four sessions to 11 percent. The oilseed touched a 16-
month high of $11.8875 yesterday.  Falling Crop Production  On Oct. 8, the USDA cut its corn-crop estimate for the
second time in as many months, predicting a 3.4 percent drop in
the domestic harvest. While farmers will collect the most
soybeans ever, the total will be 2.2 percent less than forecast
in September, the USDA said.  Cash premiums also rose as demand for U.S. supplies
increased, Stoller said.  “Exporters are raising bids to get immediate supplies,”
he said.  Government inspectors  examined 49 percent more soybeans for
export in the week ended Oct. 7 compared with a year earlier,
the USDA said today. Of the shipments, 41 percent were headed to
China, the world’s largest consumer.  Corn inspected for export rose 26 percent to 30.668 million
bushels last week from 24.429 million a year earlier, USDA data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
