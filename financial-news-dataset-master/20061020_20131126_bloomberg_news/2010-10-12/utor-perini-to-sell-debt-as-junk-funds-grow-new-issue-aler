Tutor Perini Corp. , the construction
company awarded a contract to renovate New York’s Aqueduct
Racetrack, plans to sell notes as investors add to their
holdings of high-yield, high-risk bond funds, helping create
demand for new debt.  Tutor Perini may issue up to $300 million of unsecured
notes and plans to use proceeds for general corporate purposes,
which may include takeovers and stock buybacks, the Sylmar,
California-based company said in an Oct. 6 statement distributed
by Business Wire.  Mutual funds investing in junk-rated debt are the fastest-
growing holders of high-yield corporate bonds since 2008,
Barclays Capital strategists led by  Bradley Rogoff  wrote in an
Oct. 8 note to clients. About $8.9 billion has flowed into the
funds this year, following record deposits of $32.7 billion in
2009, the strategists wrote.  “As long as defaults remain low and the yield differential
between high yield bonds and other fixed income asset classes
remains significant, we do not see a reversal of recent
trends,” Rogoff wrote. “Demand has been robust enough for new
issues to outperform the overall market this year.”  Companies have sold $209.3 billion of speculative-grade
bonds this year, surpassing last year’s record issuance of
$162.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
debt has returned 13 percent, compared with 12 percent for
investment-grade securities and 9 percent for Treasuries, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  Junk Spreads  The extra yield investors demand to own high-yield debt
instead of Treasuries narrowed 10 basis points to 612 basis
points last week, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
U.S High Yield Master II Index. Yields declined 20 basis points
to 7.85 percent.  High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point. The U.S. bond market was closed
yesterday for the Columbus Day holiday.  Moody’s assigned Tutor Perini’s notes a grade of Ba3 and
S&P ranks the debt an equivalent BB-, the ratings companies said
in separate statements.  Investment-grade spreads narrowed to 181 basis points from
184 basis points last week, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index. The average yield on
the debt fell 14 basis points to 3.56 percent, the index data
show.  The following is a description of at least $5.53 billion of
