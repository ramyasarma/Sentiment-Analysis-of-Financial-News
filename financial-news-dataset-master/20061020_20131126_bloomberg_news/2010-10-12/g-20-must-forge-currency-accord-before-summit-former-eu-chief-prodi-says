Former European Commission President
 Romano Prodi  said Group of 20 leaders must reach an agreement on
currencies before meeting in Seoul next month to ensure the
summit succeeds, according to an op-ed in Il Messaggero.  “Representatives from Europe, the U.S. and China should
lock themselves in a room and remain there until they find an
agreement to submit to the G-20,” Prodi wrote in the op-ed
published today. Not having a prior accord “would mean again
allowing competitive devaluations and throw the whole global
economy into even more catastrophic chaos.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
