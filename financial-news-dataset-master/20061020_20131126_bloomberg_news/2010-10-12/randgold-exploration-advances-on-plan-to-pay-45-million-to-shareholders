Randgold & Exploration Co. , managed
by mining magnate Brett Kebble before he was murdered, rose the
most since resuming trading in Johannesburg after announcing
plans to make 310 million rand ($45 million) of payments and
distributions to shareholders.  The  stock  gained 85 cents, or 15 percent, to 6.70 rand by
the 5 p.m. close, valuing the Sandown, South Africa-based
company at 501 million rand. The shares resumed trading on June
4 after a five-year suspension.  “The company’s current asset base is in excess of its
medium-term operational requirements,” Randgold said today in a
statement. “It is therefore an opportune time to release
further value to the shareholders.”  Randgold & Exploration’s shares were suspended on Aug. 1,
2005, after $268 million worth of stock it held in a then-
related company, Randgold Resources Plc, went missing. Kebble
quit as chief executive officer on Aug. 30 that year after being
charged with fraud and was shot in his car near his house in
Johannesburg a month after that.  Over the past five years, Randgold & Exploration recovered
some of the assets it claims were misappropriated. Current
assets consist of about 260 million rand in cash, 2.27 million
 Gold Fields Ltd.  shares and prospecting rights. The company is
no longer related to Randgold Resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
