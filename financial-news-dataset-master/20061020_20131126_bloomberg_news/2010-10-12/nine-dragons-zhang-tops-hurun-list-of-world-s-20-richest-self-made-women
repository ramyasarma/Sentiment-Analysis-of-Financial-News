Zhang Yin, chairwoman of  Nine
Dragons Paper Holdings Ltd. , topped a list of the world’s 20
richest self-made women, more than half of which call China home.  The 11 Chinese women, led by Yin’s $5.6 billion, averaged
$2.6 billion, according to the Hurun Rich List 2010, released
today.  Doris Fisher , co-founder of clothing retailer  Gap Inc. ,
is the U.S.’s wealthiest and ranked eighth with $2.5 billion,
according to  Rupert Hoogewerf , founder and compiler of the list.  The number of Chinese individuals who have more than 1
billion yuan ($150 million) in personal assets rose 36 percent
from a year earlier, according to the  report , as the nation’s
 economy  weathered the impact of the global recession. Women
accounted for 153 of the country’s millionaires, all self-made,
the report said.  “There is no other country that comes even close to
touching the number of self-made women in China,”  Hoogewerf 
said in the report.  Chinese with assets above 1 billion yuan totaled 1,363 as
of Aug. 16 compared with 1,000 a year ago, according to the
report. Fisher ranks behind five Chinese, Inditex SA co-founder
 Rosalia Mera  of Spain and Russian billionaire  Elena Baturina ,
wife of former Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.  Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. Chairman  Zong Qinghou  was China’s
richest man with about $12 billion, overtaking BYD Co. chairman
 Wang Chuanfu , who topped the list last year.  -- Zhang Dingmin . Editors:  James Gunsalus ,  Andreea Papuc   To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
