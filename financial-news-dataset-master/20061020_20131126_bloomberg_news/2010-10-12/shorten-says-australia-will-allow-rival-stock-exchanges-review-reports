Australia will allow rival stock
exchanges to move into its market and break the monopoly of the
Australian Securities Exchange, the Australian Financial
Review reported citing Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten.  It’s uncertain when other exchanges will be allowed to
enter the market, the newspaper said. Having multiple exchanges
would encourage competition in equity markets, the newspaper
said, citing Shorten.  To contact the reporter on this story:
