UBS AG revised down its one-month
forecasts for the dollar on expectations the Federal Reserve
will expand easing measures at its meeting next month.  The company sees the dollar trading at $1.40 versus the
euro in one month, from a previous target of $1.35, according to
a research note dated yesterday. The U.S. currency will be at 80
yen, from an earlier forecast of 85, it said.  The Swiss franc will be at 0.93 per dollar in month from
0.96, while the Australian currency will be at parity with the
greenback from a previous call of 96 U.S. cents, according to
the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
