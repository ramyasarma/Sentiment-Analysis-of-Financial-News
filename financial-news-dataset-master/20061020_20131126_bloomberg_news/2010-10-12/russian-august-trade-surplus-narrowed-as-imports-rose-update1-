Russia’s  trade surplus  narrowed by
almost a quarter in August, the biggest monthly decline in more
than a year, as imports rose faster than exports.  The surplus shrank to $8.3 billion from $11 billion in the
previous month, Bank Rossii said on its website today. Imports
 surged  13 percent to $23.8 billion, while exports added 0.5
percent in August, it said.  “The sharp rise in imports could stimulate demand for
foreign currency on the internal market,” Anton Nikitin,
Moscow-based analyst at Renaissance Capital, said in an e-mailed
note today before the figures were released.  The ruble weakened 1.1 percent versus the dollar to 30.1925
at 3:37 pm in Moscow today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
