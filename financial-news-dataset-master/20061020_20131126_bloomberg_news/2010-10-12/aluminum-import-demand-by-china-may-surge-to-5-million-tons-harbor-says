Aluminum imports by China, the
world’s largest producer, may increase more than 25 times by
2015 as surging local demand outpaces growth in output,
according to research group Harbor Intelligence.  Imports of the metal used in autos may total 198,000 tons
next year and 5.04 million tons in 2015, the Laredo, Texas-based
group said in a report e-mailed today. China’s demand may gain
12.9 percent a year from 2011 to 2015, outpacing annual output
growth of 9.8 percent, said the report from Harbor, which has
analyzed the global aluminum market for more than 20 years.  Increased purchases by the world’s largest metals user may
support an advance in global prices, benefiting companies such
as  Alcoa Inc. , the biggest U.S. producer. China’s aluminum
prices may gain more than 10 percent next year as an energy-
saving drive forces output cuts, Harbor’s report also said.  “Supplies are expected to tighten in the next few years as
China reduces output and demand for a metal that has few
substitutes increases,” Li Ye, an analyst at Minmetals
Starfutures Co., said from Shenzhen today.  Harbor’s projection
“certainly sounds like a lot of metal,” said Li.  Three-month aluminum traded at $2,390 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange today, having gained 23 percent over the
past year. The cash contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
may average $2,706 a metric ton, or about 18,034 yuan, in 2011,
Harbor’s report said. Cash aluminum in Shanghai has averaged
$2,430 a ton this year, and traded at about $2,408 today.  Output Cuts  “China will increasingly import primary aluminum,” the
report said. “Although there has been talk that the output cuts
are being replaced with new, more efficient capacity, our view
is that conditions are no longer in place for China’s aluminum
output to over-deliver as it did in the past.”  Growing Chinese aluminum demand will help to boost global
use by 13 percent this year, Alcoa said last week as it reported
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. Chief Executive Officer
 Klaus Kleinfeld  said that growing middles classes in China,
Brazil, India and Russia were “driving demand.”  China  produced  9.7 million tons of primary aluminum in the
first seven months of this year, according to researcher Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co. That’s about 46 percent more
than the same period last year. China’s imports  totaled  169,149
tons in the first eight months of 2010, customs data show.  Energy Target  China has started to control production of energy-intensive
plants this year as the central government aims to meet an
energy-saving target in its 11th five-year plan, which ends in
2010. Power usage by aluminum makers accounts for 6 percent of
the country’s total, according to Shanghai Metals Market. Power
accounts for as much as half of the cost of making aluminum.  A little more than 500,000 annualized tons were lost in
August in Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Guizhou and Shandong
provinces, the main aluminum-producing regions, as local
governments moved to reduce power consumption, Harbor said.  Henan province, the largest aluminum-making region, is
going to cut output nearly 20 percent in the fourth quarter,
reducing production by 180,000 tons, the Henan Nonferrous Metals
Industry Association said on Oct. 9.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer,
plans to shut 330,000 tons of obsolete smelting capacity by 2011,
equivalent to about 8 percent of its total, Chairman  Xiong Weiping  said in August. Overcapacity in the industry, estimated
at as much as 30 percent, “will disappear” in the next three
years as demand increases, Xiong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
