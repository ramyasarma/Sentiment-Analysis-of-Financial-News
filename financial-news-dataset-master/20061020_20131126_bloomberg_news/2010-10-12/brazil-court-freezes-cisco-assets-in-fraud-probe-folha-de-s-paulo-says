Cisco Systems Inc .’s assets in
Brazil were frozen by a court of justice as part of a probe into
a suspected import fraud scheme, Folha de S. Paulo reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The court decision prevents Cisco from transferring goods or
bank accounts within the country, the newspaper said. Cisco was
accused of using two fake companies to import goods, as well as
donating 500,000 reais ($299,000) to Brazil’s Workers’ Party
during the 2006 presidential campaign, Folha said.   Cisco appealed the decision and regained access to its bank
accounts in Brazil, Folha said, citing a note from the company.
Cisco is running as normal in Brazil and its operations won’t be
affected, Folha cited the company as saying.  Cisco officials in San Francisco weren’t immediately
reachable when Bloomberg News called for comment before regular
working hours.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
