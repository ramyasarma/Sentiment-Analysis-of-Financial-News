Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl ,
Italy’s oldest cooperative lender, will offer 156 million euros
($216 million) for a 51 percent of Banca Monte Parma SpA, news
agency Ansa said.  Popolare Milano will pay half of the amount in cash and the
remainder with new shares, Ansa reported without saying where it
got the information. The Milan-based bank will also agree buy
new shares of Monte Parma that the lender will sell in a 100
million-euro rights offering, Ansa said.  A spokesman at Popolare Milano declined to comment. A
spokesman for Banca Monte Parma wasn’t immediately available for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
