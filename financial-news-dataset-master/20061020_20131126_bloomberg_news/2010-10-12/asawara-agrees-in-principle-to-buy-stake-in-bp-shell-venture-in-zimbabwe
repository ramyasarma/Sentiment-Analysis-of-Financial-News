Masawara Plc , an investment company
controlled by Zimbabwean businessman  Shingai Mutasa , said it
agreed in principle to buy a stake in a joint venture in the
African nation owned by  BP Plc  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc .  Masawara’s purchase of the holding in BP and Shell
Marketing Services (Private) Ltd., or BPSMS, is subject to
regulatory approval, the Alternative Investment Market-listed
company said in a stock-exchange filing today. BPSMS owns 73
retail sites and 10 storage depots that can hold 59.9 million
liters (16 million gallons) of fuel in Zimbabwe, Masawara said.  Zimbabwe on March 25 blocked the sale of BPSMS to
 KenolKobil Ltd.  of Kenya and Engen Ltd., the South African unit
of Malaysia’s state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd., saying
neither company had sufficient Zimbabwean shareholders. Under
the country’s laws, black Zimbabweans should have a 51 percent
stake in all companies.  “Following regulatory approval the full details of the
investment will be announced to the market,” Masawara said.
Mutasa owns 63 percent of Masawara according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Calls to Mutasa’s mobile phone weren’t immediately
answered when Bloomberg News sought further comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
