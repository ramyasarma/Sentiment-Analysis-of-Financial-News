Copper prices rebounded on forecasts
that demand will outpace shrinking supplies.  Codelco Chief Executive Officer Diego Hernandez said today
in an interview in London that he expects a “tighter” market
next year. The Chilean state-owned company is the world’s
biggest copper producer. Last week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
raised its price estimates by 37 percent, citing “supply-demand
deficits.”  “Restocking through the supply chain has brought back some
copper demand,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts
including Michael Widmer said in a report. Copper prices
“should reach a new record high next year,” the analysts said.  Copper for delivery in three months rose $40, or 0.5
percent, to $8,330 a metric ton ($3.78 a pound) at 5:10 p.m. on
the London Metal Exchange. Earlier, the metal dropped as much as
1.5 percent.  Before today, copper gained 31 percent since July 1 as the 
dollar  slumped and  inventories  dropped. Yesterday, the metal
reached $8,388, the highest level since July 11, 2008.  “China is continuing to have a strong demand, and from the
supply side, we have only a couple of new projects coming on-
stream,” Codelco’s Hernandez said. The company supplies about
10 percent of the world’s mined copper.  Copper will trade at $11,000 in a year, Goldman Sachs said
on Oct. 5. That’s up from a Sept. 17 forecast of $8,050.  Copper futures for December delivery were little change at
$3.792 a pound on the Comex in New York.  Tin, aluminum, lead and zinc also rose on the LME. Nickel
dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
