Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito
Sengoku said Japan will discuss reviewing the ban on arms
exports, while adhering to the policy’s spirit.  Sengoku was speaking in Tokyo today. Japan has restricted
weapons exports since the 1960s and 1970s, citing the nation’s
pacifist constitution and the need to prevent Cold War enemies
from obtaining arms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
