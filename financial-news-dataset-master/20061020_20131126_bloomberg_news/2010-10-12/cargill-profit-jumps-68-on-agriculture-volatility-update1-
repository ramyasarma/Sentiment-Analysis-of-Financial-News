Cargill Inc., the grain distributor
that’s the largest closely held company in the U.S., said first-
quarter profit rose 68 percent as volatility increased across
agricultural commodity markets.  Net income climbed to $883 million in the three months
ended Aug. 31 from $525 million a year earlier, the Minnetonka,
Minnesota-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
earnings from its majority stake in crop-nutrient producer
 Mosaic Co. , profit gained 51 percent to $693 million. Sales
climbed 6 percent to $27.8 billion.  Cargill said its unit that buys, processes and distributes
agricultural commodities saw results rise “significantly” on
renewed market volatility. Wheat futures gained 50 percent in
Chicago trading during the quarter, corn rose 22 percent and
soybeans gained 8 percent.  “We had gone for a year with markets moving relatively
range-bound,”  Lisa Clemens , a Cargill spokeswoman, said in an
interview today. “Things began to change in June and July.
Volatility provides both risk and opportunity.”  Earnings from Cargill’s food ingredients and applications
unit were up “moderately,” the company said. Profit declined
at the agriculture services unit because of “seasonality.”  “The quarter that precedes the harvest is the slower among
the four,” Clemens said.  Earnings from Cargill’s risk-management and finance unit
were lower because of energy markets, which in contrast to
agricultural commodities “are moving by a smaller amount, up
and down in a smaller range,” Clemens said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
