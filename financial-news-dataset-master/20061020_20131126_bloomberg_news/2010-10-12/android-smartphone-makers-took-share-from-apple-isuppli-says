Google Inc. ’s Android operating
system helped smartphone makers who use the software win market
share from Apple Inc.’s iPhone in the second quarter, researcher
ISuppli said in a report today.  HTC Corp., which makes some of the Droid models for Verizon
Wireless, increased shipments 63 percent from the first quarter,
boosting its share of the global smartphone market to 8 percent,
ISuppli said.  Samsung Electronics Co. , which released the Galaxy
line of Android devices, increased shipments by 56 percent.  Android is gaining popularity as more manufacturers take
advantage of the software that Google offers for free. ISuppli
has projected that it will be used in more phones worldwide than
Apple’s software by 2012. Second-quarter shipments at Apple, the
third-largest smartphone maker, declined 4 percent worldwide
from the first quarter, ISuppli said.  Google  gained  $2.55 to $541.39 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The Mountain View, California-based
company has lost 13 percent this year. Apple added $3.18 to
$298.54.  Nokia Oyj , the largest smartphone maker globally, increased
its market share to 40 percent in the second quarter from 39
percent in the previous period after boosting shipments by 12
percent.  Research In Motion Ltd. , the No. 2 smartphone maker,
maintained its market share as shipments of its BlackBerry
device grew 7 percent sequentially.  The Android platform is already the most popular smartphone
software in the U.S., according to a separate study from Gartner
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
