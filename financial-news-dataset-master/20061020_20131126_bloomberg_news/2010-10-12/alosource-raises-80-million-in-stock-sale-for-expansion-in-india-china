HaloSource Inc., a maker of water
purification technology, raised 50.4 million pounds ($80
million) in a share sale as it seeks to expand in developing
countries to tap growing demand for clean water.  The Bothell, Washington-based Halosource expects to be
admitted to London’s Alternative Investment Market on Oct. 18,
it said today in a Regulatory News Service statement.  The company plans to use the money raised to expand its
manufacturing capacity for cartridges that are used in water
filters, Chief Executive Officer John Kaestle said today in a
telephone interview. HaloSource aims to expand existing plants
in Shanghai, Bangalore, India, and the U.S., and add facilities
in South America, the Middle East and eastern Europe, he said.  “Current capacity is about 10 million cartridges,”
Kaestle said. “We’ll be looking to more than double that over
the next two years. The strategy is to build a global water
purification business supported by regional manufacturing
operations.”  The company will focus on expanding in what he termed the
BIC countries: Brazil, India and China, Kaestle said. “They
have very large populations with emerging consumer classes with
disposable incomes and demand for white goods,” he said. “The
water problems are chronic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
