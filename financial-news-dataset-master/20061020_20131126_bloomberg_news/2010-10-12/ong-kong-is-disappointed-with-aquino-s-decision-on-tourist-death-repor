The Hong Kong government said it’s
disappointed the Philippines chose not to take more serious
actions against officials for the handling of the Manila bus
siege, in which eight members of a Hong Kong tour group died.  Philippine President  Benigno Aquino  yesterday said Manila’s
mayor and two police chiefs will face charges over their
handling of the incident last month.  “The Philippine government decided to lessen the
recommended actions against the relevant officers,” the Hong
Kong government said in an e-mailed statement. “The people of
Hong Kong, especially the survivors and the victims’ families,
will find this hard to accept.”  Members of a Hong Kong tour group died Aug. 23 when a
hijacker, a cashiered police officer, started shooting after
10 hours of negotiations, prompting the police to assault the
bus. The incident prompted Hong Kong to advise residents
against travel to the Philippines, may make it tougher for
Aquino to tap tourists to boost the economy.  The Philippine government will start administrative
proceedings against Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim for “misconduct in
office and simple neglect” under local government laws, Aquino
said. Rodolfo Magtibay, relieved as Manila’s municipal police
chief, and Leocadio Santiago, the head of metropolitan Manila’s
police force, will face charges under Philippine National Police
rules, Aquino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
