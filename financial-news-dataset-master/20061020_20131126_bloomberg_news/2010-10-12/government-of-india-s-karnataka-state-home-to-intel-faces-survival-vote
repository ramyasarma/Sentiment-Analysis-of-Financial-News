The government of India’s  Karnataka 
state, home to offices of Intel Corp., General Electric Co. and
International Business Machines Corp., is fighting for survival
ahead of an assembly vote.  As many as 19 lawmakers last week withdrew support for the
28-month-old state government, the  Bharatiya Janata Party ’s
first in the south of the country, reducing it to a minority.  H.R. Bhardwaj , the unelected governor of the state, said
today that an attempt to gauge the administration’s strength in
the regional assembly yesterday was a “farce” as there was no
record of how many legislators voted in favor of the ruling BJP-
led coalition. He ordered Chief Minister  B.S. Yeddyurappa  to try
again on Oct. 14.  Bhardwaj is a former law minister and member of the
Congress party that rules at the federal level in New Delhi.  Yeddyurappa was declared to have won yesterday’s vote amid
chaotic scenes in the assembly hours after the speaker had
disqualified 16 legislators. Opposition parties launched
protests, while the barred lawmakers approached the High Court.  The governor “has defied all norms of political
impartiality and constitutionalism,’”  Arun Jaitley , a BJP
leader told reporters in New Delhi today.  Congress said the governor was “well within his
constitutional right” to seek another vote, Press Trust of
India reported, citing Party General Secretary B.K. Hariprasad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
