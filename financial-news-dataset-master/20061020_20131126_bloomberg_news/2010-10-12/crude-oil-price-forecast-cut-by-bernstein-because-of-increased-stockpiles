Crude oil price forecasts for the
next two years were cut by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. because of
high stockpiles.  Prices of West Texas Intermediate may average $90 a barrel
in 2011, down from the research company’s earlier estimate of
$103, and average $102 in 2012, down 8 percent from its earlier
prediction, according to a report e-mailed today.  “Oil supply and demand fundamentals are definitely not any
worse but aligning the fundamentals to push prices above $100 a
barrel is not a 2011 event,” analysts  Oswald Clint  and  Neil Beveridge  said in the report. “While inventories are not as
high as 1998 they are not far away and with key segments of the
demand complex only starting to grow. It will take time to
eliminate this inventory overhang.”  The end of government stimulus packages has raised concern
that the global economy may slow, reducing energy consumption.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may leave oil
production quotas unchanged when it meets this week after Saudi
Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi described the market as “very
well-balanced.”  Crude for November delivery fell as much as 66 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $81.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, and was at $81.65 at 12:45 p.m. Singapore time. Prices
have gained 2.9 percent this year.  Global oil demand may grow 1.7 percent to 88 million
barrels a day in 2011, while supplies may rise to 87.95 million,
Bernstein said. Prices should be in the low $70s based on
developed countries’ crude and product inventories of 2.5
billion barrels, equivalent to 61 days of consumption, Bernstein
said.  Nomura Bullish  In a separate report, Nomura International Ltd. forecasts
oil prices may reach $100 a barrel in the “coming year” as
demand growth exceeds supply. Nomura estimates 2010 fourth
quarter oil prices to average $85 a barrel, according to a
report e-mailed today.  OPEC spare capacity is down 600,000 barrels a day from its
peak of 6.7 million reached in March 2009, and this trend may
continue and accelerate from the second half of 2011, said
 Michael Lo , an analyst at Nomura.  “We expect a decline in inventories towards the second
half of 2011 from the current elevated levels,” he said.  Consumption may climb 1.8 million to 88.4 million barrels a
day next year, with emerging economies likely to account for 1.4
million, Nomura said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
