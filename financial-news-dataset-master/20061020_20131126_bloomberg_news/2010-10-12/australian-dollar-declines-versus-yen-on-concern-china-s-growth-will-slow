The Australian dollar fell against
the yen on concern stricter lending rules in China will cool
demand for the South Pacific nation’s exports.  The Aussie also weakened as stocks and commodities dropped,
damping demand for currencies linked to growth. China,
Australia’s biggest trading partner, has temporarily raised
reserve requirements for six lenders, according to three people
with knowledge of the matter.  “The commodity-based currencies are starting to pull back
a bit,” said  Dennis Cajigas , a senior market strategist at the
brokerage MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago. “All eyes are
watching China as the engine for growth.”  Australia’s currency dropped 0.2 percent to 80.56 yen at
12:06 p.m. in New York, from 80.74 yen yesterday. It touched
81.83 on Oct. 7, the highest level since May 17. New Zealand’s
dollar traded at 61.65 yen, compared with 61.70 yen.  The  MSCI World Index  of stocks fell 0.5 percent, while
crude oil for November delivery decreased 0.7 percent to $81.66
a barrel. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
