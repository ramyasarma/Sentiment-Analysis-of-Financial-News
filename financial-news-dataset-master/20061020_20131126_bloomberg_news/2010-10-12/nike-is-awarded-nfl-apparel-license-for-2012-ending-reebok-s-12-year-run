Nike Inc. , the world’s largest
sporting-goods maker, won the license to make National Football
League-branded apparel and uniforms, replacing Reebok.  NFL owners approved a licensing deal with Nike that will
begin in 2012, the league said in an e-mailed statement today.
Reebok, which was acquired by  Adidas AG  in 2006, has held the
license since 2001.  Reebok’s NFL license represents about $350 million of its
$565 million in U.S. apparel revenue,  Kate McShane , an analyst
at Citigroup Inc. in New York, wrote in a note to investors
yesterday. The license may boost Nike’s earnings per share by as
much as 3 percent in 2012, said McShane, who is based in New
York and has a “buy” rating on the shares.  Nike had the resources and is willing to pay for it,  Chris Svezia , an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group in New York,
said in an interview. “Is it game-changing for them? No. $300
million to $500 million is 2 percent to 3 percent of global
revenue. That’s small.” Svezia has a “neutral” rating on the
shares.  Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon,  rose  27 cents to $82.25
at 11:34 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
Adidas, based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, fell 1.3 percent in
Frankfurt trading.  “If we lose the NFL it won’t make or break our company,”
Adidas Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer  told CNBC on Sept.
