Former Alaska Governor  Sarah Palin ’s
political action committee raised $1.2 million in the year’s
third quarter and gave $10,000 to the state Republican Party in
Iowa, site of the first 2012 presidential nominating caucuses,
Federal Election Commission filings show.  Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, also
used some of the PAC’s cash to aid insurgent U.S. Senate
candidates who won primaries against challengers backed by party
officials. These nominees, who received the maximum $5,000
contribution for their general election campaigns, include
 Christine O’Donnell  in Delaware,  Rand Paul  in Kentucky and  Joe Miller  in Alaska.  The three also are supported by Tea Party activists who
favor shrinking the size of government and limits on taxes and
public debt.  In all, Palin’s PAC made $93,500 in donations to candidates
and Republican political committees from July to September. It
had $1.3 million in the bank as of Oct. 1.  Palin, 46, earlier gave $5,000 to Miller for his primary
race, in which he beat Senator  Lisa Murkowski , who is now
running a write-in campaign to keep her seat. Palin had defeated
Murkowski’s father, then-Governor  Frank Murkowski , in Alaska’s
2006 Republican gubernatorial primary and was elected that
November. She resigned from the office in July 2009.  Palin, a potential presidential candidate in 2012, last
month was the keynote speaker at the Iowa Republican Party’s
largest annual fundraising dinner. A Bloomberg National Poll
conducted Oct. 7-10 found that President  Barack Obama  would
defeat Palin in a White House race, 51 percent to 35 percent.
The survey of 721 likely voters has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.7 percentage points.  Her PAC has raised a total of $2.5 million this year and
contributed $190,500 to candidates and Republican political
committees, according to FEC filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
