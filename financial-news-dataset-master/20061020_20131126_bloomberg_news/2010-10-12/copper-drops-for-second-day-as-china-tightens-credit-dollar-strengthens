Copper fell in New York after the
dollar strengthened and China, the world’s biggest user of the
metal, moved to curb bank lending to cool its economy.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, added as much as 0.6 percent. China’s
central bank raised reserve requirements for six banks for a
two-month period, three people with knowledge of the matter
said.  “The currency is still the dominant driver in the market
today,” said  Daniel Major , an analyst at RBS Global Banking &
Markets in London.  Copper for delivery in December dropped 2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.7695 a pound at 8:09 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices yesterday touched the highest level since July 8,
2008. Copper for delivery in three months slipped 0.1 percent to
$8,283 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  Prices rebounded from today’s lowest levels as the dollar
index, last up 0.3 percent, pared gains. A stronger U.S.
currency makes dollar-priced metals more expensive in terms of
other monies and saps demand for commodities as an alternative
investment.  Comex copper’s 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of
whether a commodity is overbought or oversold, was at 67.5 after
last week rising above 72. Some analysts and traders who study
technical charts view readings above 70 as a sign that prices
may be poised to fall.  ‘Overextended’ Prices  “Prices are just looking a little overextended after the
recent gains,” RBS’s Major said. Copper may drop for three to
four weeks after this week, he said.  China has moved this year to restrain economic growth in
response to concern about potential inflation. Officials in
April ordered developers not to take deposits for sales of
uncompleted apartments without proper approval and clamped down
on loans for third-home purchases to cool rising prices.  While the increased reserve requirement is “hardly
surprising,” such steps “affect sentiment more than
anything,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital
in London. Copper “still looks strong,” he said.  Copper consumption will outpace supply this year by 58,000
tons as demand increases and supplies are disrupted, Standard
Bank Plc said. Until now, it predicted a surplus.  LME copper stockpiles fell 0.2 percent to 371,750 tons,
daily exchange figures showed. Orders to draw copper from LME
stocks, or canceled warrants, slid 2.8 percent to 24,600 tons.  Tin, Aluminum  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME rose 1 percent to
$26,450 a ton. Prices touched a record $26,790 on Oct. 6. The
metal has jumped 56 percent this year, leading advances on the
exchange, after production was disrupted in Indonesia and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.  PT Timah , the world’s largest tin exporter, may miss a
production target this year because of heavy rains and the
Indonesian company is trying to renegotiate supplies with long-
term customers. Timah may produce 40,000 tons, compared with a
goal of 45,000 tons, Corporate Secretary  Abrun Abubakar  said in
an interview.  Aluminum rose 0.9 percent to $2,422 a ton. Demand may
outpace production by 700,000 tons next year as usage in China
increases and exchange-traded products take metal away from the
market, according to research group Harbor Intelligence.  Nickel dropped 0.7 percent to $24,150 a ton, lead was
unchanged at 2,315 a ton and zinc gained 0.3 percent to $2,336 a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
