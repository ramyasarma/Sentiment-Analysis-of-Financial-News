A train collided with a bus in
eastern Ukraine, killing at least 41 people and injuring 10 in
what the government said was the biggest accident since the
country gained independence almost 20 years ago.  The crash occurred when the bus driver tried to cross the
railroad tracks, ignoring a siren that warned of an oncoming
train, at 9:25 a.m. local time near the village of Maksymivka,
the Ministry for Emergency Situations said in a  statement  on its
website. Maksymivka is about 450 kilometers (280 miles)
southeast of the capital, Kiev.  Seven people were transported to a hospital in the city of
Dnipropetrovsk, and three others are in poor condition in
another hospital close to the site of the accident, the Kiev-
based ministry said.  President  Viktor Yanukovych  declared tomorrow as a national
mourning day in a decree, posted on his website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
