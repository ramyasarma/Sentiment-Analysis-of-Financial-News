New York Jets Pro Bowl cornerback
 Darrelle Revis  has soreness and swelling in his left hamstring
that might keep him out of this weekend’s game against the
Denver Broncos, coach  Rex Ryan  said.  Revis, who had missed the previous two games with a
hamstring strain, received treatment after playing in last
night’s 29-20 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Revis said last
night he began to feel soreness in the hamstring in the first
quarter and it became more painful throughout the game.  “I hope it’s just a little thing that happens and he can
push through it,” Ryan said today at a  news conference.  “I
know he was sore last night and he had swelling. Hopefully he’ll
be just fine and ready to roll. If not, we’ll look at what’s in
the best interests of him and the team.”  Ryan said the Jets didn’t rush Revis back to the lineup and
that the rainy conditions last night at New Meadowlands Stadium
in East Rutherford, New Jersey, didn’t contribute to his latest
hamstring problems. Revis’s status for this week’s game hasn’t
been determined.  “If he’s healthy, we want to play Darrelle,” Ryan said.
“We need to win games so we can get into the postseason. Is he
going to be better three weeks from now if we don’t play him?
That’s still to be determined. I don’t think we’re there yet.”  The Jets, at 4-1, are tied for the best record in the
National Football League, having won four straight games since
an opening-week loss to the Baltimore Ravens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
