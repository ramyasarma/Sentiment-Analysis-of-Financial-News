Hope has turned to doubt and
disenchantment for almost half of President  Barack Obama ’s
supporters.  More than 4 of 10 likely voters who say they once
considered themselves Obama backers now are either less
supportive or say they no longer support him at all, according
to a Bloomberg National Poll conducted Oct. 7-10.  Three weeks before the Nov. 2 congressional elections that
Republicans are trying to make a referendum on Obama, fewer than
half of likely voters approve of the president’s job
performance. Likely voters are more apt to say Obama’s policies
have harmed rather than helped the economy. Among those who say
they are most enthusiastic about voting this year, 6 of 10 say
the Democrat has damaged the economy.  “He’s made compromises that have hurt the middle class,”
says poll respondent Alan Graham, 55, a surgeon in London,
Kentucky, who supported Obama in 2008 and now is on the fence
about the president. “I think the lobbyists for the big
businesses are having their way with him.”  A year after the official end of the U.S. recession, growth
has slowed again without big gains in employment. Joblessness,
which was  9.6 percent  in September, has barely budged since
reaching a 26-year high of 10.1 percent last October. Gross
domestic product has slowed from a 5.0 percent annual growth
rate in last year’s final quarter to 1.7 percent during the
second quarter.  S&P Gains  While stocks have risen since Obama took office Jan. 20,
2009, the gains largely came during his first year. The  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  is up more than 44 percent since Obama was
inaugurated, though only 4.5 percent this year.  Obama responded to the financial crisis he inherited by
embracing the Bush administration’s $700 billion bank bailout,
as well as a taxpayer-financed rescue of the auto industry, and
providing a $814 billion economic stimulus program and the
biggest overhaul of financial regulations since the Great
Depression.  The poll shows that almost two-thirds of voters believe the
country is on the wrong track and  unemployment  is the top
concern for about half the electorate. The  budget deficit , which
was $1.291 trillion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 and
$1.416 trillion for 2009, ranks as the second most pressing
issue, cited by 27 percent.  Personal Approval  Obama’s deteriorating job-approval numbers are balanced by
continuing regard for him personally: 53 percent of voters have
a positive view of the president in the October poll, up from 49
percent in a July survey.  In a hypothetical presidential match-up against one of the
Republican Party’s most prominent figures, Obama beats former
vice presidential nominee  Sarah Palin  51 percent to 35 percent.  Former President  George W. Bush  and Republicans in Congress
still get more blame than Obama or congressional Democrats for
the condition of the economy. The White House is trying to tap
this current of public opinion with a campaign theme portraying
a vote for Republicans as a move “backward” on the economy.  Two-thirds of likely voters say Bush hurt the economy and
57 percent say congressional Republicans have. Forty-seven
percent say Obama’s policies have damaged the economy and 53
percent say congressional Democrats have done so.  While some prominent corporate leaders have complained
Obama is too anti-business, most voters don’t share that
concern. More than half believe Obama has struck the right
balance or is too pro-business. Only 36 percent of voters
consider the president anti-business.  Anti-Business  By contrast, in a September poll of Bloomberg subscribers
who are investors, analysts or traders, more than three-quarters
of U.S. respondents said the president is anti-business.  Obama also outdoes Republicans in the debate over renewing
the  Bush-era tax cuts  that expire Dec. 31. A 43 percent
plurality of likely voters support Obama’s plan to allow the
Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest to expire. In the investor
poll, two-thirds favored continuing the tax cuts for all,
including families making more than $250,000.  On Obama’s main foreign-policy initiative, 6 of 10 voters
say Afghanistan is now a lost cause, up from 55 percent in July.  “It’s worse than a dead end, and he doesn’t seem to
recognize that,” says poll respondent Nick Ruffin, 66, an asset
manager in McLean, Virginia.  Women and Independents  The erosion of backing for Obama among onetime supporters
has been most notable among two groups of voters who were
central to his election: women and independents. More than 6 of
10 of the former Obama backers who have turned away from him are
women; 53 percent of the onetime supporters are independents.  “I understand it’s an uphill battle, but I don’t think
things are that much better than when he was elected,” says
poll respondent Daphne Feeney, 28, an Army wife and stay-at-home
mother in Seaside, California, who voted for Obama and now says
she is ambivalent about the president.  The disaffection of the former Obama supporters doesn’t
necessarily translate into an embrace of Republicans or Tea
Party candidates, said J.  Ann Selzer , president of Des Moines,
Iowa-based  Selzer & Co. , which conducted the poll. In the
hypothetical contest with Palin, the former Obama supporters
favor the president more than two-to-one.  “I hear people talk about this all the time,” Selzer
says. “The excitement they once felt is gone and they are left
wondering if they were sold a bag of goods.”  ‘Certainly Skeptical’  This doesn’t mean Democrats have lost these onetime
supporters, she said, though “they are certainly skeptical” of
that party. “This is what makes this election so volatile.”  Though the disaffected Obama supporters give him low marks
on his performance in office with 39 percent job approval,
compared with 47 percent among all voters, they are just as
likely to view him favorably personally.  Obama is outshined among all voters by two close members of
his entourage: Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , who is viewed
favorably by 64 percent, and First  Lady Michelle Obama , viewed
favorably by 62 percent.  The survey of 721 likely voters has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
