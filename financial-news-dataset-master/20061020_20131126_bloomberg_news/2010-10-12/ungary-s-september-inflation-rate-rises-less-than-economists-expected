Hungary’s annual  inflation  rate rose
less than economists forecast in September as the prices of
consumer durable goods and clothing declined, outweighing
accelerating fuel and food cost increases.  Inflation rose to 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent in August,
which matched the lowest rate since June 2009, the statistics
 office  in Budapest said today. The median estimate of eight
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 3.9 percent. Prices dropped
0.1 percent from August, declining for a second month.  The central bank raised its inflation forecast for the next
two years in August, citing a weaker currency and rising energy
costs. Rising price pressure in past months eliminated the room
for rate cuts, policy makers said. The central bank, which
targets an inflation rate of 3 percent, kept the  benchmark rate 
unchanged at 5.25 percent for a fifth month on Sept. 27.  “The rise in fuel prices dominated, while price increases
in services were below average and declines in consumer durable
goods tempered the increase in the price index,” statistician
Borbala Minary told reporters.  Fuel costs rose an annual 6.3 percent in September,
compared with 5.8 percent in August. Services inflation was 3.1
percent after 2.8 percent the previous month. Food price-
increases accelerated to 3.9 percent in September from 3.7
percent in August. Clothing prices declined an annual 0.5
percent and those of consumer durable goods by 2.9 percent.  On the month, food prices fell 0.4 percent and those for
services dropped by 0.8 percent. Clothing prices rose 3.6
percent from August.  Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy
prices, rose an annual 1.5 percent in September.  Annual average inflation will be 4.7 percent in 2010, the
central bank said t on Aug. 23. For 2011 and 2012, the bank
raised its inflation forecasts by 0.5 percentage point to 3.5
percent and 3.4 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
