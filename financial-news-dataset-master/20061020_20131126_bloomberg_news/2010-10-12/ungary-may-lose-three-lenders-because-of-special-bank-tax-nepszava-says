Three lenders in Hungary are
considering exiting the country because of a special tax the
government imposed on financial institutions, Nepszava reported
today without citing anyone.  The lenders in question are “not small banks,” whose
total assets are “not far behind” those of OTP Bank Nyrt.,
Hungary’s largest bank, Nepszava said on its website today. The
newspaper didn’t name the banks it says are considering leaving
Hungary.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
