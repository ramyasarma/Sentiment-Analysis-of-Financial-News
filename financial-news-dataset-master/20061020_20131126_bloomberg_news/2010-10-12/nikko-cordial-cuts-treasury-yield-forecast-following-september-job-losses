Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. cut
its year-end forecast for U.S. 10-year yields to 3 percent from
3.5 percent after the Labor Department said the world’s biggest
economy lost 95,000 jobs in September.  The Oct. 8 report is fueling bets the Federal Reserve will
increase Treasury purchases to keep borrowing costs low, said
 Hiroki Shimazu , an economist in Tokyo at the unit of Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-largest publicly
traded bank by assets. Yields will rise from today’s 2.37
percent, Shimazu said, though not by as much as he estimated
earlier this month.  “The market predicts the Fed will enlarge its  balance
sheet ,” Shimazu said. “It’s not a done deal.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of the 18 primary dealers
that are authorized to trade directly with the Fed, said
September’s employment decline will lead the Fed to snap up
Treasuries to avoid a recession. U.S. two-year yields extended
their slide to record lows today as traders bet policy makers
will act as soon as their next meeting, which starts Nov. 2.  The Fed’s assets have grown to $2.31 trillion from $893.8
billion at the end of 2007 because the central bank bought
Treasuries and mortgage debt to sustain the U.S. economic
recovery.  The Fed scooped up $300 billion of Treasuries last year,
and said in August it would reinvest proceeds from maturing
mortgage holdings into government debt.  Fed Buying  “Friday’s jobs numbers put the seal on” another round of
Fed buying, New York-based  Jan Hatzius , chief U.S. economist at
Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail note. Policy makers will
announce roughly $500 billion of additional purchases through
about the middle of 2011, he wrote.  The two-year note  yielded  0.34 percent as of 1:11 p.m. in
Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The rate dropped to a
record 0.335 percent earlier today. The 0.375 percent security
due in September 2012 traded at a price of 100 2/32.  The rate will climb to 0.6 percent this year, Shimazu said.
Treasury yields already reflect forecasts for Fed purchases,
creating the possibility that traders will be disappointed if
the plan falls short of expectations or the central bank opts
not to buy, he said.  A Bloomberg survey of banks and securities companies
projects 10-year yields will climb to 2.43 percent and two-year
rates will advance to 0.49 percent by Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
