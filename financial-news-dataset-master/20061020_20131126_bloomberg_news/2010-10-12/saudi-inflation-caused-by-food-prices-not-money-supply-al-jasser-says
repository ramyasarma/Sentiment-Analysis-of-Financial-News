Inflation in Saudi Arabia
accelerated this year due to higher global food prices, not
excessive money supply, central bank Governor  Muhammad al-Jasser 
said.  Inflation rates haven’t risen to worrying levels and
there’s no plan to set price targets, al-Jasser said in an
interview shown on Dubai-based Al Arabiya television today.  Saudi Arabian  inflation  accelerated for seven straight
months before slowing to 5.9 percent in September. Food and
drink prices rose 7.5 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation
will remain above 5 percent through the first half of next year,
Jeddah-based  National Commercial Bank  said in an e-mailed report
last month.  The world’s largest oil supplier is spending revenue earned
from crude exports to diversify its economy away from
hydrocarbons and create jobs. It approved a $385 billion, five-
year development plan in August.  That extra spending will have limited inflationary impact,
and an increase in housing will help cut rising property prices,
Finance Minister  Ibrahim al-Assaf  told the newspaper Asharq Al-
Awsat today.  Al-Jasser also said he expects an increase in bank lending
in the fourth quarter, and that Saudi banks are required to make
100 percent provisions against non-performing loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
