German Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle  warned against a possible “trade war” between
western countries and China,  N-TV television  reported.  Bruederle, speaking to traveling reporters as he began a
five-day trip to China and Japan, urged China to avoid
protectionism and cited a “mutual responsibility” to defuse
tension over accusations that the Chinese government is
manipulating its currency, the broadcaster said on its Web site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
