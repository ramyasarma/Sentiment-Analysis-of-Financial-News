Japan is poised to pass China as the
largest U.S.  creditor  for the first time since August 2008 as
growing demand for U.S. government debt reduces borrowing costs
for President  Barack Obama  as the deficit swells.  Japan added $55.3 billion of Treasuries this year, swelling
its holdings 7.2 percent to $821 billion, Treasury data show.
China, which overtook Japan in September 2008, cut its stake by
$48.1 billion, or 5.4 percent, to $846.7 billion. Japan made its
biggest purchase in 10 months in July, just after China cut its
position by the most on record.  The purchases show no slowdown in demand for  America’s
debt , helping to limit rates on everything from corporate bonds
to mortgages as global economic growth slows and the deficit
expands to $1.4 trillion. Treasury yields average 1.31 percent,
down from 5.21 percent at the start of the financial crisis in
mid-2007, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  “The U.S. still has the confidence of investors,” said
 Carl Lantz , the head of interest-rate strategy in New York at
Credit Suisse Group AG, one of 18 primary dealers of U.S.
government securities that trade with the Federal Reserve.
“When you’re a reserve manager, it’s not about return on
investment, it’s return of investment.”  Even with China’s sales,  foreign holdings  of U.S. debt have
increased $374 billion this year, or 10 percent, to $4.07
trillion as of July, Treasury data show. At that pace, net
purchases would rise to $641 billion in 2010 from $614.8 billion
last year and second only to $723.7 billion in 2008.  Record Low Yields  Yields on two- and  five-year Treasuries  dropped to all-time
lows last week, while the yield on the benchmark 2.625 percent
note due in August 2020 fell to 2.39 percent in its fourth
consecutive weekly decline, from 2.80 percent on Sept. 10. The
price rose last week 1 1/32, or $10.31 per $1,000 face value, to
102, according to BGCantor Market Data.  Ten-year note yields fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.35 percent at 6:27 a.m. in New York. The
two-year note yield reached a new low of 0.327 percent today.  Demand from international investors for Treasuries clashes
with the view of  Warren Buffett , the chairman of Omaha,
Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  Investors buying bonds
now “are making a mistake,” he said Oct. 5 at Fortune
magazine’s Most Powerful Women conference in Washington.  “It’s quite clear that stocks are cheaper than bonds,”
Buffett said. “I can’t imagine anyone having bonds in their
portfolio when they can own equities.”  Bonds Versus Equities  Stock dividends  are paying more than government bonds. Ten-
year Treasuries yield 5.2 percentage points less than equities
of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index when adjusted
for annual inflation, near the biggest spread since March 2009.  Investors are seeking the safety and liquidity of U.S. debt
as the global economy slows and as governments intervene in
foreign-exchange markets to weaken their currencies by
purchasing dollars.  Holdings of Treasuries in  custody at the Fed  for accounts
including foreign central banks climbed 9.1 percent in the third
quarter to $2.48 trillion, the biggest rise since a 16.6 percent
increase in the last three months of 2008, after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. caused investors to abandon all
but the safest government debt.  World economic growth will slow to 4.2 percent next year,
from 4.8 percent in 2010, the Washington-based International
Monetary Fund said in a report Oct. 6. Japan, to keep its
exporters more competitive, said it sold more than 2 trillion
yen ($24 billion) last month in its first sales in the foreign-
exchange market in six years.  Congressional Elections  Demand from Japan and other foreign investors has eased
concern about Obama’s ability to fund the  deficit  heading into
the Nov. 2 congressional elections, even as his other
initiatives have met resistance, such as his plan to keep tax
cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 in place for households earning
less than $250,000 while ending them for those who earn more.  Treasuries are attractive for Japan now because buying in
dollars means selling yen, which rose yesterday to a 15-year
high of 81.39 to the dollar. Much of the dollars purchased by
the Bank of Japan in October likely ended up invested in
Treasuries, according to  Richard Franulovich , senior currency
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York.  “I’m watching the markets carefully,” Japanese Finance
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  told reporters Oct. 8 in Washington,
where he was attending a meeting of finance ministers from the
Group of Seven. “There is no change in my stance that we will
take bold actions, including intervention, if necessary.”  ‘Foreign Securities’  Japan’s total foreign reserves increased in September by
$39.4 billion, of which “ foreign securities ” accounted for
$37.9 billion, according to  Tohru Sasaki , head of Japan rates
and foreign-exchange research in Tokyo at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “This means that all the U.S. dollars obtained by
intervention on Sept. 15 have already been invested in U.S.
securities,” he wrote via e-mail.  While China’s Treasury holdings have declined by 10 percent
from a peak of $939.9 billion in July 2009, there has been no
drop-off in  trade between  the world’s two largest economies.
U.S. exports to China increased 36 percent to $48.6 billion
through July, while imports from China rose 22 percent to $193.9
billion, Commerce Department data show.  Sales of Treasuries are likely to be limited because any
drop in bond prices or further  weakness in the dollar  would
diminish the value of its remaining holdings.  ‘Enormous Losses’  Attempts by the People’s Bank of China to diversify away
from the dollar will create a self-reinforcing decline in the
currency, causing the central bank to “suffer enormous
losses,” said  Michael Cheah , who oversees $2 billion in bonds
at SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.  “The Chinese have to be very, very careful,” said Cheah,
who worked at the Singapore Monetary Authority from 1982 through
1999, and now teaches finance classes at New York University and
at Chinese universities.  For investors in Japan coping with record low yields, U.S.
debt is relatively  cheap . Ten-year Treasuries yield 1.50
percentage points more than similar-maturity Japanese government
bonds, up from 0.82 percentage point in December 2008.  Satoshi Okumoto , a general manager in Tokyo at Fukoku Mutual Life
Insurance Co., said he bought Treasuries last quarter.  “Treasuries are quite attractive, especially from the view
of Japanese investors, because there still is a yield,” said
Okumoto, whose firm has the equivalent of $66.4 billion in
assets. “Money is flowing into U.S. bonds from Japan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
