Greece and Italy sold 7.7 billion
euros ($10.6 billion) of treasury bills, with Greece’s financing
costs declining after the country indicated progress in taming
the euro-region’s second-largest budget deficit.  Italy sold 6.5 billion euros of 12-month bills today and
investors requested 2.16 times the securities on sale, compared
with 1.9 times at the previous auction on Sept. 10. The bills
were priced to yield 1.441 percent, up from 1.428 percent at the
last auction.  Greece sold 1.17 billion euros of 26-week bills and
investors bid for 4.2 times the securities offered, compared
with 4.5 times at the last sale on Sept. 14. The yield fell to
4.54 percent from 4.84 percent at the previous auction.  The auctions were the first since Greece announced its 2011
budget plan and said its deficit would shrink to 7 percent of
gross domestic product next year, less than previously forecast
and about half of last year’s rate. Italy now forecasts its
shortfall will narrow to 3.9 percent next year and within the
EU’s 3 percent limit in 2012.  Financing costs for both countries have surged this year.
Greece’s soaring deficit prompted investors to shun debt of the
so-called peripheral countries in Europe, and led the European
Union to offer a 110 billion-euro rescue for the Mediterranean
country. Greece’s progress in taming the deficit through higher
taxes and spending cuts has led to yields on its debt narrowing
in recent weeks, underpinning gains in other peripheral bonds.  The  difference  in yields investors demand to buy Greek 10-
year bonds over comparable German bunds was 704 basis points
today, down from 899 basis points on the day of the last bill
sale on Sept. 14. Italy’s spread with Germany has narrowed to
148 basis points from 160 basis points at the start of this  Even with the gains in peripheral debt, the 1.441 percent
Italy paid on its 12-year bills was more than twice the 0.607
percent Germany offered investors at the last sale of similar
maturity on Sept. 27. The 4.54 percent offered by Greece today
was more than seven times the 0.614 percent Germany paid at a
sale of 6-month bills on Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
