Great Wall Motor Co.  and  Lifan
Industry Group Co . said they will sell shares in Shanghai as
Chinese automakers seek to fund expansion in the world’s largest
vehicle market.  Great Wall, the biggest maker of pickup trucks in the
nation, will use proceeds from the sale of 121.7 million shares
to fund car-parts production plans of about 3.17 billion yuan
($476 million), the Heibei, northern China-based company said
today. Lifan, based in Chongqing, central China, will raise as
much as 1.48 billion yuan from the sale of 200 million shares,
it said in a separate statement.  The companies join Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co.
and BYD Co. in planning to sell shares in China as automakers
increase capacity to meet rising demand. Rebounding economic
growth and investor confidence has put China on course to be the
world’s biggest IPO market this year, PwC said in July.  Great Wall, whose shares already trade in Hong Kong, more
than tripled first-half net income to 867 million yuan. Unit
sales of Wingle pickups, Cowry multipurpose vehicles and other
models jumped 71 percent to 148,152. The company’s overseas
markets include the Middle East, Africa and South America.  Shareholder Approval  Shareholders in Great Wall must approve the Shanghai share
sale during an extraordinary general meeting on Nov. 26, and the
sale is still subject to regulatory approval, the automaker said.  Companies have raised 391 billion yuan selling shares in
Shanghai and Shenzhen this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with 231 billion yuan for the whole of
last year. IPOs in China are likely to raise 500 billion yuan
this year, according to PwC.  Great Wall rose 0.2 percent in HK$20.70 in Hong Kong as of
10:24 a.m. local time. The company has more than doubled this
year, compared with a 6.2 percent gain for the benchmark Hang
Seng index.  China’s vehicle sales including buses and trucks jumped 39
percent in the first eight months to 11.58 million, according to
the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The full-year
tally may rise to 17 million, China Business News said on Sept.
