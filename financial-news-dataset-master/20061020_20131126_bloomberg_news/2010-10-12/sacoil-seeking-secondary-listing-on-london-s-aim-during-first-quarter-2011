SacOil Holdings Ltd. , the
Johannesburg-based company with a concession in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, said it may begin “aggressive” fundraising
soon after its planned secondary listing on London’s Alternative
Investment Market early next year.  “We’re talking about in the hundreds of millions of
dollars necessary for the transactions we’re looking to do,”
 Robin Vela , chief executive officer of SacOil, said by phone
from Johannesburg today. Lead broker Renaissance Capital Ltd.
“has quite an aggressive capital-raising plan,” he said,
adding that it could start in the first half of next year.  AIM market investors have “a bigger appetite” for primary
oil and gas assets, Vela said in a statement today. SacOil is
one of three oil and gas stocks on the Johannesburg exchange.  SacOil  was formed two years ago to take advantage of
Africa’s growing presence as an oil producer. Africa is expected
to surpass North America in 2011 to become the third-largest
producing area after the Middle East and Central and Eastern
Europe PricewaterhouseCoopers said on Sept. 15.  The company was granted an exploration right over Block 3
on the Democratic Republic of Congo side of Lake Albert in June.
 Tullow Oil Plc  has found petroleum resources on the Ugandan side
of the lake. SacOil’s shareholders include Investec,
Metropolitan Asset Management and Stanlib.  SacOil shares declined  1 cent, or 1.1 percent, to 92 cents
at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
