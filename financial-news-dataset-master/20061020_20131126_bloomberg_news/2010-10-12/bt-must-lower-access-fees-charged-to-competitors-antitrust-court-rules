BT Group Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
phone company, must lower the fees it charges competitors to
access the company’s phone and broadband lines because of errors
by a regulator, an appeals court ruled.  Price caps put in place in May 2009 by telecommunications
regulator Ofcom were too high due to the watchdog’s errors in
calculating inflation and efficiency, the  Competition Appeal
Tribunal  ruled yesterday in London.  Ofcom should adopt new price controls “as soon as
possible,” a three-judge panel of the tribunal said in the
ruling. “Once the price controls are adopted, BT will be bound
to comply with their terms.”  The ruling follows a finding by Britain’s antitrust
regulator, the Competition Commission, in support of some claims
in the appeal by  TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc  and  British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc . BT said last year that the price cap was
already too low to allow the company to recover costs.  Ofcom spokeswoman  Elizabeth de Winton  said the Competition
Commission had “overwhelmingly endorsed” its approach to price
controls, and that the changes will result in an adjustment of
about 4 million pounds ($6.32 million).  BT spokeswoman  Gemma Thomas  said Ofcom’s errors were
“relatively small” compared with what TalkTalk argued in
court. The prices apply to BT’s Openreach unit.  “Only minor price changes should be made,” Thomas said
today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
