The yen fell against all of its
major counterparts as rising stocks and signs the global
economic recovery is gathering momentum spurred demand for
higher-yielding assets.  Japan’s currency also dropped as Bank of Japan Governor
 Masaaki Shirakawa  indicated he may examine enhancing a
5 trillion yen ($61 billion) fund to buy government debt. The
euro traded within a cent of an eight-month high versus the
dollar as a gain in European output stoked speculation the
European Central Bank will end debt purchases before the Fed.  “The yen weakened as demand for riskier assets improved,”
said  Neil Mellor , a currency strategist at Bank of New York
Mellon Corp. in London. “Shirakawa’s comments about possibly
increasing the BOJ’s range of asset purchases also weighed on
the currency. It has to be seen to be believed whether or not
Japanese monetary policy is going to have any lasting impact on
the yen.”  Japan’s currency weakened 0.5 percent to 114.30 per euro at
7:30 a.m. in New York, from 113.79 yesterday. The yen slid 0.1
percent to 81.81 per dollar, from 81.72. It touched 81.39 on
Oct. 11, the strongest level since April 1995. The euro gained
0.3 percent to $1.3971, from $1.3924. It reached $1.4029 on Oct.
7, the highest level since Jan. 28.  The MSCI World  Index  of shares advanced 0.7 percent, while
and the Stoxx Europe 600  Index  climbed 1 percent.  Aussie Gain  Australia’s dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to 98.91 U.S.
cents as a gauge of consumer confidence rebounded in October.
The Aussie touched 99.18 U.S. cents on Oct. 7, the highest level
since it began trading freely in 1983.  The sentiment index for Australia rose 3.3 percent to 117
this month, after a 5 percent drop last month, according to a
Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute survey of 1,200
consumers conducted Oct. 4-10.  The Russian ruble fell to its weakest level against the
euro in eight months as three of the biggest domestic trading
firms said the central bank is weakening exchange-rate limits.
The ruble slipped to 42.20 per euro, the weakest since Feb. 2.  Asian currencies strengthened on speculation Fed
quantitative easing will pump more cash into the U.S. economy,
boosting the inflow of funds into emerging-market assets.  South Korea’s won was the best performer versus the dollar
among the most-traded currencies, advancing 1 percent to
1,120.70. It touched 1,110.75 on Oct. 11, the strongest level
since May 3.  Thailand’s Baht  Thailand’s baht gained 0.1 percent to 29.94 per dollar
after advancing to the 13-year high of 29.80 even as the
government said yesterday it will remove a 15 percent tax
exemption on overseas investors’ income from domestic bonds.  The Dollar Index, used by  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.  to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and Swiss franc, slid as much as 0.5 percent to 76.972. It
touched 76.906 on Oct. 7, the lowest level since Jan. 15. The
franc strengthened to 95.45 centimes per dollar, the strongest
ever, before trading at 95.51 centimes.  The gauge of the dollar has fallen 4.1 percent since Sept.
21, when the Fed said in a statement following its policy
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed” to support the recovery.  That phrase was meant to be in accord “with the members’
sense that such accommodation may be appropriate before long,”
according to minutes released yesterday of the Federal Open
Market Committee’s meeting.  ‘Hurting the Dollar’  “The FOMC minutes kept expectations alive that another
round of quantitative easing might begin as early as November,”
said  Gareth Berry , a currency strategist at UBS AG in Singapore.
“These minutes are hurting the dollar.”  The yen remained stronger than 82.88 per dollar, where it
traded on Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged selling the yen to
help its export-dependent economy.  The Japanese currency’s advances hurt companies’ profits
and confidence, the BOJ’s Shirakawa told parliament today,
adding that the bank will keep monitoring the currency market
“with great interest.”  Large manufacturers expected the yen to average 89.44 per
dollar in the six months to March 2011, according to the Bank of
Japan’s Tankan survey released on Sept. 29.  The euro approached its strongest level against the dollar
since January as the European Union’s statistics office said
 industrial production  rose 1 percent in August after a revised
0.1 percent increase in July. That’s above the 0.8 percent gain
forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  European Central Bank Governing Council member  Axel Weber 
said yesterday that the risk of recession in Europe is
“negligible” and the central bank should stop its bond-
purchase program. Weber, who also heads Germany’s Bundesbank,
said “these securities purchases should now be phased out
permanently.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
