U.S.  stocks  advanced, sending
benchmark indexes to five-month highs, the dollar fell and gold
declined for the first time in three days after minutes of the
Federal Reserve’s last meeting showed the central bank was
prepared to buy more government debt to stabilize the recovery.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4 percent to
1,169.77 at 4 p.m. in New York, after earlier dropping as much
as 0.8 percent. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency
against six major partners, fell 0.2 percent to reverse a gain
of as much as 0.6 percent. Gold declined 0.6 percent to
$1,346.70 an ounce. The yield on the 30-year Treasury  bond  rose
four basis points to 3.79 percent. Oil slipped for a second day.  Fed policy makers were ready “before long” to increase
purchases of Treasuries, a tactic known as quantitative easing,
and focused on boosting inflation expectations as a way to prop
up the economy, minutes of the Sept. 21 meeting showed.  “The minutes supported the general notion that the Federal
Reserve will be engaged in quantitative easing, and will
formalize its policy” in the next meeting on Nov. 3, said  David Kovacs , head of quantitative strategies at Turner Investment
Partners in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, which manages $19 billion.
“There is pretty strong empirical evidence that when there is
quantitative easing, the liquidity that’s been added to the
system finds its way into equities and there is a substantial
rally.”  Financial companies and technology stocks led the S&P 500
higher today. The measure last month climbed 8.8 percent, its
best September since 1939, as the central bank had said it was
willing to ease monetary policy further.  Treasuries Fall  The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yield rose for a third day
on speculation the Fed will buy shorter-maturity debt and as the
government prepared to sell $13 billion of the securities this
week. The two-year note yield rose two basis points to 0.359
percent after the government’s sale of $32 billion of three-year
debt attracted weaker demand than at past auctions. The 10-year
note yield gained three basis points to 2.418 percent.  The euro strengthened to $1.3874, rebounding after European
Central Bank Governing Council member  Axel Weber  said the ECB
should end its bond-purchase program.  “As the risks associated with the Securities Markets
Program outweigh its benefits, these securities purchases should
now be phased out permanently,” Weber said, according to the
text of a speech delivered in New York today.  Dollar Falls  The dollar depreciated 0.3 percent to 81.83 yen, near the
15-year low of 81.39 reached yesterday. The Swiss Franc rallied
versus all 16 of its major counterparts as concern the recovery
is slowing spurred demand for a haven. The pound dropped 0.5
percent to $1.5808 after a report showed U.K. inflation exceeded
the government’s 3 percent limit for a seventh month in
September.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  lost 0.3 percent before the
meeting minutes were released. BHP Billiton, the world’s largest
mining company, slid 1 percent. France’s  CAC 40  sank 0.5 percent
as workers demonstrated against the government’s overhaul of the
pension system.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  fell 1.3 percent, the biggest
drop in a month, as commodity companies declined. The  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index  slipped 0.8 percent, with benchmark
equity gauges in South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and the
Czech Republic losing more than 1 percent. The  Shanghai
Composite Index  rallied for a third day, as gains by commodity
shares offset declines by banks.  Oil, Corn  Crude oil slipped 0.7 percent to $81.67 a barrel on
speculation that U.S. inventories rose to a three-month high and
signs that OPEC will leave production targets unchanged.  Corn jumped to a two-year high and soybeans rose for a
fourth session as processors buy more inventory amid signs that
the U.S. will produce smaller crops than forecast.  Corn for December delivery rose 23.25 cents, or 4.2
percent, to close at $5.79 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, capping a 19 percent rally over the past four sessions.
Earlier, the price touched $5.8425, the highest level since
August 2008.  Soybean futures for settlement in November rose 26 cents,
or 2.3 percent, to $11.785 a bushel in Chicago, bringing the
gain over four sessions to 11 percent, including a 16-month high
of $11.8875 yesterday.  Raw sugar futures jumped 3.2 percent to 27.45 cents a
pound, reversing earlier declines and extending its rally for a
fourth day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
