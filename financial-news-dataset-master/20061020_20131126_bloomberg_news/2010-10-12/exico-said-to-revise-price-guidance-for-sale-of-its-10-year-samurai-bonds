Mexico updated the price guidance
for Samurai bonds it plans to sell as early as Oct. 20,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the transaction.  The government told investors the 10-year bonds will yield
between 50 basis points and 60 basis points more than the yen
swap rate, said the person, asking not to be identified as the
information is private.  The Latin American nation wants to raise about 150 billion
yen ($1.8 billion) and hired Nomura Securities Co., Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities Co. to
manage the sale,  Octavio Lara , deputy director of debt issuance
for Mexico’s finance ministry, said Sept. 14.  Samurai bonds are yen-denominated debt sold in Japan by
overseas borrowers. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
