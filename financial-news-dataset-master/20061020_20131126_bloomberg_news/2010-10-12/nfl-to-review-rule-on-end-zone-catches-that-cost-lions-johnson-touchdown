The National Football League will
review the rule on catches in the end zone that cost  Calvin Johnson  of the Detroit Lions a possible game-winning touchdown
during the first week of this season.  Rich McKay , co-chairman of the NFL’s Competition Committee,
said that the rule, which mandates that receivers make a second
“football move” after catching balls in the end zone, will
“definitely be discussed” after the season.  “I think we need to go back and look at that rule,” McKay
told reporters said at the league owners meetings in Chicago.  With the Lions trailing the Chicago Bears 19-14 with 31
seconds remaining in the game on Sept. 12 at Chicago, Johnson
came down with a pass in the end zone. The 25-year-old receiver
landed in bounds, but lost control of the ball when it hit the
ground. Referees determined that Johnson had not completed the
“process” of the catch, or made a second football move, and
ruled the pass incomplete. The call was reviewed and upheld.  The Lions are 1-4 and last in the National Football
Conference North standings. They got their first win of the
season on Oct. 10 against the St. Louis Rams.  The Bears are 4-1, in first place in the NFC North.  To contact the reporter on this story:
