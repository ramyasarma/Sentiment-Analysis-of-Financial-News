Britons’ pessimism about their
financial prospects for the next year fell to the lowest on
record in September on concern about personal debt and job
security, according to a survey by YouGov Plc with Bloomberg LP.  An index of  consumers’ confidence  in their own finances
dropped to minus 33 percent from minus 22 percent in August, the
lowest since at least February 2009, the survey of 2,122 people
showed. A gauge of how respondents felt their situation had
altered in the past month was unchanged at minus 24 percent,
YouGov said. The survey was conducted on Sept. 10-12.  “Since the run up to the general election, people’s
outlook for the future has grown increasingly negative,” Todd
Davis, Financial Services Consulting Director at YouGov, said in
a statement. “With more people saying their debts are
increasing and savings shrinking,  forecasts  for an ‘L-shaped’
recovery seem more and more likely.”  U.K. consumers are bracing themselves for the biggest
budget cuts since World War II as Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  prepares to detail his spending plans next week.
While the economy grew at the fastest pace in nine years in the
second quarter, Bank of England officials have warned the fiscal
squeeze will hamper the recovery.  YouGov calculates the readings by subtracting the
percentage of respondents who said their situation has worsened
from the percentage who said it improved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
