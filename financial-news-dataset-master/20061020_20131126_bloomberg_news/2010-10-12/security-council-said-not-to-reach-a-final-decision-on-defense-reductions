The U.K. National Security Council,
which met today to discuss which military programs should be
axed, has not reached a final conclusion, although there is
consensus on the main issues, a person familiar with the talks
said.  Prime Minister David Cameron will announce the security
aspects of the Strategic Defense and Security Review on Oct. 18,
while the cuts to the defense programs will be announced a day
later, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
