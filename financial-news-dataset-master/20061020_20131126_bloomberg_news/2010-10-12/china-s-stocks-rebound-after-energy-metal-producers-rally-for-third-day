China’s stocks rebounded as energy
and metal producers rallied as possible U.S. measures to boost
its economy may weaken the dollar and spur inflows into
commodities.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.4 percent to 2,818.70
at 1:26 p.m. local time. The CSI 300 Index advanced 0.7 percent
to 3,153.87. Gauges of energy and material producers gained 3.6
percent and 2.9 percent respectively, the most among the 10
industry groups in the CSI 300 Index.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
