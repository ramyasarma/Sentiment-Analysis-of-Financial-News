Aluminum prices in China, the
world’s largest producer, may jump by more than 10 percent next

research group Harbor Intelligence said.  The cash contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange may
average $2,706 a metric ton, or about 18,034 yuan a ton, in
2011, the Laredo, Texas-based research said in a report e-mailed
today.   To contact the reporter on this story:
