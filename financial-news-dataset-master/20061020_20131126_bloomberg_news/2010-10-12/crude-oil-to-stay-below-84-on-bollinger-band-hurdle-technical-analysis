Oil will remain below $84 a barrel
in New York this week because of chart resistance marked by a
Bollinger Band, according to Cameron Hanover Inc.  Crude, which reached a five-month high of $84.43 a barrel
last week, won’t sustain rallies to revisit that price because
the market is “overbought,” said  Peter Beutel , president of
the energy adviser in New Canaan, Connecticut. Futures fell
today for a second day after advancing 12 percent in the past
three weeks.  “Prices still have Bollinger Band resistance overhead,”
Beutel said in a note. “Prices remain overbought right now. Too
many traders and investors are buying into the market.”  Crude for November delivery dropped as much as 91 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $81.30 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was at $81.36 at 3 p.m.
Singapore time. Futures have gained 2.5 percent this year amid
speculation the global economic recovery would boost fuel demand.  The upper Bollinger Band, at around $83.85 a barrel, is
part of a technical indicator that plots support and resistance
levels based on volatility. Oil last breached the upper Band on
Aug. 2, when the market settled at $81.34, before losing 12
percent over the following three weeks.  Oil has risen too quickly based on so-called fast
stochastic oscillators, according to Beutel. The indicators have
been above 70, a reading that signals prices may be set to
decline. Hedge funds last week increased  bullish bets  on oil to
the highest level since mid-April, according to data from the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  “Buy-stops are now over $83.15, $84.45, $86.25,” Beutel
said of resistance levels. “Sell-stops,” or support levels
below which prices may continue to fall, are under $80.30 and
$79.70, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
