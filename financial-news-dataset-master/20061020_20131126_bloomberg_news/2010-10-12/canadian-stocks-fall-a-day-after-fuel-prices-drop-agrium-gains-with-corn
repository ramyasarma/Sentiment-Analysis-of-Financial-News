Canadian stocks  fell from a two-year
high as oil and gas producers dropped a day after fuel prices
declined on a stronger U.S. dollar and forecasts of mild
weather.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, lost 1.8 percent as
Canadian markets reopened after the Thanksgiving holiday
yesterday. Agrium Inc., Canada’s  second-biggest  fertilizer
producer, rose 2.9 percent after corn futures advanced to a two-
year high.  Teck Resources Ltd., which sells coal to Chinese steel
producers, decreased 2.2 percent after three people with
knowledge of the matter said China will raise reserve
requirements for six banks for two months.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  retreated 15.05
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,520.54 as of 9:33 a.m. in Toronto.  Coming into this week, the S&P/TSX had gained for four-
straight weeks for the first time since September 2009. The
index climbed  3.6 percent  during the period. Energy and raw-
materials stocks rallied as the U.S. dollar slumped to a nine-
month low against a basket of world currencies on concerns that
new stimulus measures will weaken the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
