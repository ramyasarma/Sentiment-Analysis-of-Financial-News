The People’s Bank of China sold one-
year bills at a yield of 2.0929 percent, unchanged for the 17th
sale in a row, according to traders at Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd. and BOC International (China) Ltd.  The monetary authority offered 22 billion yuan ($3.3
billion) of the securities at the auction today.  The central bank last allowed the yield to rise on June 8
to attract bids from banks, helping withdraw cash from the money
market.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
