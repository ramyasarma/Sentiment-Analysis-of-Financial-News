  Alpiq Holding AG  isn’t interested
in selling its stake in Italian electricity company Edipower for
cash, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, citing an interview with  Antonio Taormina , head of Alpiq’s Western European Energy unit.  “Alpiq doesn’t want a purely financial stake, and doesn’t
want its stake to be liquidated in cash or shares,” Taormina
said, according to the Italian newspaper. Switzerland’s largest
utility owns 20 percent of Edipower, while   Edison SpA , Italy’s
No. 2 generator, has a 50 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
