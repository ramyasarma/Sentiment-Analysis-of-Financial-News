European stocks  retreated as a slump
in a U.K. house-price gauge fueled concern that the equities
rally has outpaced prospects for the economy.  Punch Taverns Plc, the largest U.K. pub owner, tumbled 11
percent after reporting a 218 million-pound ($346 million)
impairment charge. Nobel Biocare Holding AG and Straumann
Holding AG sank more than 4 percent as UBS AG downgraded the
dental-implant makers. Daimler AG led auto stocks higher as UBS
recommended the second-largest maker of luxury cars.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  lost 0.3 percent to
262.48 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London as more than three
stocks fell for every two that rose. The measure has climbed 13
percent from this year’s low in May, pushing the gauge’s
 valuation  to 15.5 times the reported earnings of its companies,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are pretty cautious on equities,”  Richard Cookson ,
global chief investment officer at Citigroup Inc.’s Private Bank
in London, said on Bloomberg Television’s On The Move with
Francine Lacqua. “One would want to pare one’s exposure into
this rally.”  The Stoxx 600 rose 1.2 percent last week amid speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce plans to stimulate
economic growth at its Nov. 2-3 meeting. The Fed is releasing
minutes from its September gathering after the close of European
equity markets today. The Bank of England must not tighten
monetary policy too soon and risk hurting an “immature”
economic recovery, policy maker  David Miles  said today.  U.K. House Prices  The number of U.K. real-estate agents and surveyors  saying
house prices fell  exceeded those reporting gains by 36
percentage points last month, down from minus 32 points in
August, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said. A
measure of price expectations fell to minus 41, the lowest level
since March 2009.  The BOE’s benchmark  interest rate  will probably stay close
to a record low for the next two years as the U.K. economy
weathers “stormy seas,” said  Philip Green , the billionaire
owner of Arcadia Group Ltd.  “The worst hopefully is behind,” the retail magnate said
in an interview with Bloomberg Television late yesterday in
London. “Do I think there’s still some stormy seas? Yes,” he
said, predicting that U.K. interest rates “don’t go far for the
next 18 months, two years.”  French Strikes  National benchmark indexes fell in 16 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 declined 0.2 percent and
Germany’s DAX slipped less than 0.1 percent. France’s  CAC 40
Index  lost 0.5 percent as workers demonstrated for the fourth
time in five weeks against the government’s overhaul of the
pension system and labor unions threatened open-ended strikes.  Punch Taverns sank 11 percent to 80.05 pence after writing
down the value of its pubs. Pretax profit excluding one-time
items fell to 131 million pounds in the year ended Aug. 21,
compared with 160 million pounds in the same period a year
earlier, the company said in a statement.  Nobel Biocare  slid 9.8 percent to 16.85 Swiss francs, the
biggest decline in two months, as UBS downgraded its
recommendation on the shares to “sell” from “neutral.”
Smaller rival Straumann dropped 4.2 percent to 211.8 francs as
the brokerage cut the shares to “neutral” from “buy.”  Soco International Plc , a U.K. energy explorer in Africa
and Southeast Asia, plunged 19 percent to 369.4 pence, the
biggest drop in 12 years. The company said it will plug and
abandon its appraisal well offshore Vietnam.  Safran Sinks  Safran SA  slid 1.9 percent to 20.20 euros as Areva SA sold
a 3.65 percent stake in Europe’s second-biggest aircraft-engine
maker for 20.23 euros a share.  Audika SA, the French hearing-aid retailer, dropped 6.8
percent to 17.99 euros as it reported a decline in third-quarter
revenue to 19.8 million euros ($27.5 million) from 20.7 million
euros a year earlier.  Daimler climbed 3.3 percent to 47.43 euros as automakers
had the biggest gain among 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600.
UBS raised the luxury-car maker to “buy” and increased its
price estimate by 36 percent to 53 euros, saying it expects a
faster recovery in profits for trucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
