Tin production by  PT Timah , the
world’s largest exporter, may miss a target this year because of
heavy rains and the Indonesian company is trying to renegotiate
supplies with long-term customers, according to an executive.  State-owned Timah may produce 40,000 metric tons this year
compared with the 45,000-ton target, Corporate Secretary  Abrun Abubakar  said in an interview today. Spot sales, which normally
account for 20 percent to 30 percent of volumes, have been
halted, he said in Jakarta, forecasting further gains in prices.  Timah’s production shortfall underscores a supply squeeze
in the global market that’s made tin this year’s best performer
on the London Metal Exchange, with the price reaching a record
earlier this month. Barclays Capital has predicted a 15,000-ton
shortage next year, the biggest since at least 2003. Timah
accounted for 43 percent of the Asian nation’s output in 2009.  “We are in talks with buyers” Abubakar said. “We’re
asking them to renegotiate shipments.”  Tin, used as a solder and in packaging, has rallied from a
low of $9,700 in December 2008, when the global financial crisis
slashed demand. The metal for delivery in three months touched
an all-time high of $26,790 a ton on Oct. 6, and traded at
$25,700 at 3:03 p.m. in Singapore today, down 1.9 percent.  ‘No More Spot Sales’  About 70 percent to 80 percent of sales are usually made on
a contractual basis, with the rest made in the spot, or cash,
market, Abubakar said. “Now we’re only focusing on meeting
long-term contracts to our loyal buyers, no more spot sales.”  Timah, based in Pangkal Pinang, Bangka-Belitung province,
sells most of its production to Japan, South Korea and Singapore,
Abubakar said, declining to identify individual customers.  PT Timah  fell as much as 4.5 percent to 3,200 rupiah today,
the worst performer on the  LQ-45 Index , which tracks the
market’s 45 most-traded stocks.  A La Nina weather event has brought heavier-than-usual
rainfall to parts of Australia and Asia this year, including
Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy. The rains have hurt
tin production, and also been blamed by industry groups in the
country for lower output or missed forecasts for cocoa and coal.  Tin output from China may be restricted until the end of
the year because of limitations on power use, industry group
ITRI Ltd. said Sept. 29. A general ban on mining was also
imposed last month in three eastern provinces in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Africa’s largest producer.  Tin stockpiles  tracked by the LME dropped 54 percent this
year, falling to a 17-month low of 12,255 tons yesterday.
Exports from Indonesia declined for the first eight months of
this year to 60,107 tons from 67,798 tons a year earlier.  “If we see the production problems in Indonesia, and also
the declines in tin stockpiles on the LME, tin prices most
likely will keep rallying,” PT Timah’s Abubakar said.  Timah produced 45,086 tons of tin last year, according to
the company’s website. Indonesia’s total output that year was
105,000 tons, according to an estimate from the energy ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
