Australia’s banks should increase
lending to small businesses to close a gap in the funding market
left by the collapse in securitization after the global
financial crisis, Small Business Minister  Nick Sherry  said.  “I would urge lenders to look to fill the gap in funding
as much as the regulators will permit,” and ensure they “price
the risk realistically,” said Sherry, according to a copy of
remarks to a banking conference in Sydney today.  Lenders are charging business customers “an extra risk
premium” following the collapse of securitization because “of
a lack of knowledge of specific businesses,” Sherry told the
Australian Banking and Finance forum. “It is this information
gap that I would like to see the lenders close, so that risk can
be more appropriately priced.”  The U.S. subprime collapse froze Australia’s securitization
markets as investors shunned all but the safest and most simple
forms of debt. Securitization is the process of pooling loans
and slicing them into securities of differing risk for sale to
investors.  Loans valued at less than A$2 million ($1.97 million) taken
out by businesses accounted for 29 percent of all new company
loans approved in the past year, Sherry said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
