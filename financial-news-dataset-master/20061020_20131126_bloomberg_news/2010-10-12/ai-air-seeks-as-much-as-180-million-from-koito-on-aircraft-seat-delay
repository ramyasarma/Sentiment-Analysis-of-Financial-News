Thai Airways International Pcl, the
nation’s largest carrier, said it’s seeking as much as $180
million in compensation from seatmaker Koito Industries Ltd.
after delays disrupted the introduction of 11 aircraft.  The carrier filed a claim notice in the past few days,  Raj Tanta-Nanta , vice president for investor relations, said today
by phone from Bangkok.  Koito  tumbled 12 percent in Tokyo trading, the most in
eight months, to 128 yen. Parent Koito Manufacturing Co., part-
owned by Toyota Motor Corp., dropped 5.8 percent to 986 yen.  Yoichiro Kuroiwa , a spokesman for Yokohama, Japan-based
Koito Industries, declined to comment.  Koito has plunged 46 percent since Feb. 8, when it said it
made unauthorized design changes and would inspect seats in
about 1,000 planes worldwide. Delivery delays also forced
Singapore Airlines Ltd., All Nippon Airways Co. and Continental
Airlines Inc. to postpone the introduction of new aircraft.  Thai Air  selected new seat suppliers for the five Airbus
SAS A330s and six A380s affected by the Koito delay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
