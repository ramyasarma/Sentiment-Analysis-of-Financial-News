European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Axel Weber  said the risk of Europe falling back
into recession is minor.  “Having been hit hard by the financial crisis the European
economy as a whole now is on a stable path toward recovery,”
Weber said according to the text of a speech delivered in New
York today. “I am confident that the danger of sliding back
into recession is negligible.”  The euro area economy exited the recession in the third
quarter of 2009 and expanded at the fastest pace in four years
between March and June. Even so, concerns remain that the so-
called periphery countries may not be able to fix their public
finances and grow sufficiently to repay their debt.  Irish gross domestic product fell 1.2 percent in the second
quarter as consumers cut spending and import growth outweighed
an increase in exports.  Weber also rejected calls for countries like Germany which
run current account surpluses because of strong exports, to
introduce policies that stimulate domestic demand.  The situation of surplus economies in the euro area is
“not comparable” to that of some emerging markets, Weber said.  “Analogies between Germany and China may be fashionable,
but are grossly misleading,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
