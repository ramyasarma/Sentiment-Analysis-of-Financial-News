Soybeans rose for a fourth day in
Chicago on speculation that adverse weather in Brazil, the
world’s second-largest grower and exporter after the U.S., will
delay planting.  Dry weather in central Brazil during the next five days
will slow seeding of oilseeds, according to T-Storm Weather LLC
in Chicago. The U.S. soybean crop will be 2.2 percent smaller
than forecast in September, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said Oct. 8.  “Soybeans gained on risks of a lower-than-expected
Brazilian soy harvest in the coming months,”  Stefan Graber , an
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a report today.  Soybeans for November delivery advanced 8.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $11.6125 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The oilseed yesterday surged to
$11.8875, the highest level in 16 months.  Corn pared gains after rising as much as 1.3 percent as
output is forecast to drop in the U.S., the biggest grower and
shipper of the grain.  Corn for December delivery advanced 0.25 cent to $5.56 a
bushel. The grain yesterday climbed as much as 8.5 percent to
$5.7325, the highest level since September 2008.  U.S. corn production will fall 3.4 percent from a year
earlier to 12.664 billion bushels, reducing reserves before the
2011 harvest to the lowest level since 1997, the USDA said Oct.
8. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast output at 12.977
billion bushels. Corn climbed 12 percent in the past two
sessions.  Wheat, Rice  “The latest projections add pressure to the already-tight
supply situation” for corn, Credit Suisse’s Graber said.  Wheat for December delivery fell 4.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $7.045 a bushel. Milling wheat for November delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris slid 2.1 percent to 218.50 euros
($301.98) a metric ton.  Rice gained in Chicago after a producer’s group said
yesterday the harvest in the U.S., the world’s fourth-largest
exporter last year, may be at least 10 percent smaller than
estimated, missing a forecast record output and pushing prices
30 percent higher.  Futures may surge to $16 to $17 per 100 pounds by January
after hot weather in rice-producing areas of the U.S. curbed
yields and lowered milling rates, said Dwight A. Roberts,
president of the U.S. Rice Producers Association, who correctly
predicted the grain would peak at $16 last year.  Rice for November delivery rose 4.5 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $13.05 per 100 pounds. The contract on Oct. 8 reached
$13.295, the highest price since April 12.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
