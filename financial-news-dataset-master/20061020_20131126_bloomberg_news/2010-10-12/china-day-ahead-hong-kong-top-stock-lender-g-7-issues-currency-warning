Hong Kong has surpassed Japan for
the first time as Asia’s most-lucrative market for stock lenders,
boosted by investor demand for Chinese securities to be used in
short sales.  Pensions, mutual funds and banks reaped $245 million in the
past year from loaning out Hong Kong shares, compared with $241
million from Japanese  equities , according to fee data tracked by
 Data Explorers  since 2007. Short sellers borrow and sell stock
hoping that prices will drop and they can buy back the
securities, repay the loan and pocket the difference.  Rising demand to borrow reflects heightened interest in
Chinese companies from bulls and bears alike, not just
speculation equities will fall, according to  Emil Wolter , the
Singapore-based head of Asian regional strategy at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index trades for 14.6
times the profit of its companies, down 40 percent from its 2009
high, while the Shanghai Composite Index fetches 19 times
earnings compared with 51.6 in 2007.  G-7 Warns China  Group of Seven nations reminded China and other emerging
nations of their promise for more currency flexibility, limiting
themselves to a verbal notice “at this point,” European
Central Bank Governing Council member  Axel Weber  said.  The G-7 nations met over the weekend in parallel to the
annual meetings of the  International Monetary Fund , seeking more
currency flexibility to ease global tensions.  China  rebuffed the
pressure, saying that its currency, the yuan, would be allowed
to rise gradually.  “All we did at this point is remind authorities in surplus
 emerging market economies  that they promised at the Toronto
meeting, in the G-20, to increase the degree of flexibility of
their exchange rate arrangements with respect to the major
industrialized countries,” Weber said in New York. “At this
point the simple reminder that you need to embark on that
trajectory was the outcome of the G-7 meeting and is the main
message I’d like to repeat.”  Uganda Approves Deal  Uganda is set to approve  Tullow Oil Plc’s  sale of oil field
assets to Cnooc Ltd. and Total SA, said  Patrick Bitature , the
chairman of the Uganda Investment Authority.  “Government has given a nod in principal,” Bitature told
reporters in the capital, Kampala. Planned investments by Cnooc
and Total are expected to be reflected in the authority’s
reports for the last quarter of the year, he said.  Hong Kong Disappointed With Philippines  The Hong Kong government said it’s disappointed the
Philippines chose not to take more serious actions against
officials for the handling of the Manila bus siege, in which
eight members of a Hong Kong tour group died.  Philippine President  Benigno Aquino  said Manila’s mayor and
two police chiefs will face charges over their handling of the
incident last month.  “The Philippine government decided to lessen the
recommended actions against the relevant officers,” the Hong
Kong government said in an e-mailed statement. “The people of
Hong Kong, especially the survivors and the victims’ families,
will find this hard to accept.”  Rich Chinese Women  Zhang Yin, chairwoman of  Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Ltd. ,
topped a list of the world’s 20 richest self-made women, more
than half of which call China home. The 11 Chinese women, led by
Zhang’s $5.6 billion, averaged $2.6 billion, according to the
Hurun Rich List 2010.  The number of Chinese individuals who have more than 1
billion yuan ($150 million) in personal assets rose 36 percent
from a year earlier, according to the  report , as the nation’s
 economy  weathered the impact of the global recession. Women
accounted for 153 of the country’s millionaires, all self-made,
the report said.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks rose, erasing earlier losses and sending
benchmark indexes to five-month highs, as Federal Reserve policy
makers indicated they are ready to pump more cash into the
economy to protect the recovery.  Bank of America Corp.,  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. helped lead a recovery by the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index after minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 21 meeting showed the
central bank was ready to ease monetary policy “before long.”
King Pharmaceuticals Inc. jumped 39 percent, the most in 11

New York after sliding 0.8 percent earlier. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 10.06 points, or 0.1 percent, to
