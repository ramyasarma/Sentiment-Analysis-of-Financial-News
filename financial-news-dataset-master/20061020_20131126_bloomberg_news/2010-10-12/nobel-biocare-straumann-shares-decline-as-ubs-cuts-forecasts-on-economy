Nobel Biocare Holding AG  and
 Straumann Holding AG  fell in Swiss trading after UBS AG cut
profit estimates for the dental-implant makers, citing slower-
than-forecast market growth as the economy remains restrained.  Dental-implant sales will increase 2 percent this year and
5 percent in 2011, down from previous estimates of 4 percent and
6 percent,  Maja Pataki , a UBS analyst in Zurich, wrote in a
report today. UBS reduced the forecasts after meeting industry
executives at a  European Association of Osseointegration 
conference in Glasgow this month, checks with dentists and a
survey, she wrote.  Shares of both companies fell the most in two months.
Pataki cut her profit  estimates  for Nobel Biocare by 10 percent
on average for 2010 to 2014, while she lowered  estimates  for
Straumann by 3 percent to 9 percent over the same period.  “The cut in estimated market growth rates is in line with
a more conservative outlook for the economy,” Pataki wrote. She
cut Glattbrugg, Switzerland-based Nobel Biocare to  “sell”  from
“neutral” and lowered Basel, Switzerland-based Straumann to
 “neutral”  from “buy.”  Nobel Biocare dropped 1.84 Swiss francs, or 9.8 percent, to
16.85 francs at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Zurich, giving
the company a market value of 2.1 billion francs ($2.2 billion).
The decline was the biggest since Aug. 11.  Straumann declined 9.20 francs, or 4.2 percent, to 211.80
francs, also the biggest drop since Aug. 11. The company has a
market value of 3.3 billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
