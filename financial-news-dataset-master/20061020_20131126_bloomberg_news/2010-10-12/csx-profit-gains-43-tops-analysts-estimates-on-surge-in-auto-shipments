CSX Corp.  Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Ward  said increased U.S. automobile production is
helping drive a gradual economic recovery.  The second-largest publicly traded U.S. railroad yesterday
reported third-quarter  profit  that topped analysts’ estimates as
a 44 percent increase in automotive shipments boosted rail
volumes. North American car and light-truck production rose 62
percent through August this year to 7.86 million vehicles,
according to Ward’s AutoInfoBank.  “Except for  housing-related , we’re seeing things continue
their gradual recovery,” Ward, 60, said today in a telephone
interview. “You are getting the drag effect you would expect as
automotive continues to rebound.”  Profit from continuing operations climbed to $414 million,
or $1.08, from $290 million, or 73 cents, a year earlier,
Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX said yesterday in a statement.
The average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
profit of $1.04 a share.  Total shipping volumes rose 10 percent, CSX said. Sales
climbed 16 percent to $2.67 billion, helped by higher prices and
revenue gains in autos, chemicals and fertilizers.  “There is some pricing ability because we are an
attractive option for people,” Ward said. “If they look at
their options of moving stuff by truck or other modes, rail is
the most attractive to them. So even with the slightly higher
prices, we still are a good value.”  CSX rose $2.40, or 4.2 percent, to $59.66 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have
gained 23 percent this year.  Union Pacific Corp.  is the largest publicly traded U.S.
railroad. CSX trails both Union Pacific and Warren Buffett’s
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. by 2009 revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
