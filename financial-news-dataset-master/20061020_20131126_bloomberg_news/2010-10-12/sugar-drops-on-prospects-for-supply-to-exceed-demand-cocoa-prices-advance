Coffee climbed to a one-week high as
demand rebounded following yesterday’s price slump. Sugar rose,
erasing an earlier drop.  The coffee market is “extremely vulnerable to sharp price
shocks” should supplies be disrupted by adverse weather, the
International Coffee Organization said.  “People on the sidelines are jumping back in,” said
 Hector Galvan , a senior trading adviser at RJO Futures in
Chicago.  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 7.15 cents, or 4
percent, to $1.858 a pound at 12:38 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. n
New York. Earlier, the price reached $1.88, the highest level
since Sept. 29. Yesterday, the commodity dropped 1.9 percent.  “The market did get a little bit oversold, so we got a
little bit of a technical bounce,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior
analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago.  Robusta-coffee futures for January delivery rose $26, or
1.6 percent, to close at $1,687 a metric ton at 5:30 p.m. on
NYSE Liffe in London.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.74 cent, or 2.8
percent, to 27.33 cents a pound in New York. Earlier, the price
reached 27.4 cents, extending a rally to the highest level since
February.  Sugar jumped 46 percent in the third quarter amid shipping
delays in Brazil, the world’s biggest exporter.  Refined-sugar futures for December delivery rose $21.40, or
3.2 percent, to close at $697.70 a ton in London.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell $3, or 0.1
percent, to close at $2,850 a ton at 12:05 p.m. in New York.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery climbed $9,
or 0.5 percent, to close at 1,914 pounds ($3,021) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
