RWE AG may get the final building
permit for the construction of the Gazela gas pipeline in the
Czech Republic next year, Lidove Noviny reported, citing Thomas
Kleefuss, a representative of the company’s division Net4Gas,
which is in charge of the project.  The company has secured permits from 90 percent of
landowners whose property will be affected by the pipeline’s
construction, the newspaper said, citing an interview with
