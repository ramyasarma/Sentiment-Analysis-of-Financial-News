Sachin Tendulkar , the highest scorer
in international cricket, completed his sixth double-hundred as
India gained the edge in the second cricket Test against
Australia.  The 37-year-old scored 214 in Bangalore before he was
bowled by Peter George, making his debut, as the home team
reached 495 all out in reply to Australia’s 478. Tendulkar, who
has a record 49 Test hundreds, struck 24 boundaries.  Australia reached 202-7 in its second innings by close of
play on the fourth day, a lead of 185 runs. Captain  Ricky Ponting  was top scorer with 72, while spinners Pragyan Ojha and
Harbhajan Singh took 3-57 and 2-63.  Mitchell Johnson  and Nathan
Hauritz are not out for 7 and 8.  The 5-foot-5 Tendulkar, known as the “Little Master,” hit
 Ben Hilfenhaus  for a single to reach 200 runs, part of his sixth
century this year. He’s now made 10 centuries more than Ponting,
who scored one ton in the same period.  India is hosting Australia for two matches, their 21st
series in the elite five-day format. The nations have played
each other in Tests since 1947, with contests ranging from one-
off matches to best-of-six.  The South Asian nation is seeking to wrap up the two-Test
series after winning the first match by one wicket.  To contact the reporter on this story:
