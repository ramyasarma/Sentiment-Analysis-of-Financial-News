Canada lost its bid for a seat on
the United Nations Security Council in part because local
opposition parties didn’t support the effort, Foreign Affairs
Minister Lawrence Cannon said.  Cannon also told reporters at the UN today that some of
Canada’s decisions on foreign policy, including a shift in what
countries received international aid, weren’t “always
popular.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
