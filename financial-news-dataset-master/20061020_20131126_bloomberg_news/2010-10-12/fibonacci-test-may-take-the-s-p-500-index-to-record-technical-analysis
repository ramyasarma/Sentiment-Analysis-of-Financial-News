The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
rise by year-end to a level seen by technical analysts as a
harbinger for a return to the benchmark’s 2007 record, according
to  Ryan Detrick  at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.  The U.S. stock gauge closed at 1,165.32 yesterday, within
about 65 points of recovering 61.8 percent of its loss between
October 2007 and March 2009. Should the  S&P 500  rise above this
Fibonacci retracement level of about 1,230, it could mark the
start of a “long-term” climb toward its all-time closing high
of 1,565.15 three years ago, Detrick said.  Fibonacci analysts use a system pioneered by 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa that assumes asset prices will
follow patterns based on proportions found in nature. The S&P
500 last approached the 61.8 percent retracement level when it
climbed to 1,217.28 on April 23, before plunging as much as 16
percent on concern that U.S. unemployment and widening budget
deficits in Europe will derail global growth.  “The overall sentiment toward this market is a little too
low,” Detrick, senior technical strategist at  Schaeffer’s , said
in a telephone interview from Cincinnati. “We’ve been watching
equity mutual fund outflows. When you have that negativity, it
can be very bullish.”  Investors redeemed $3.18 billion from U.S. equity funds
during the first week of October, according to  EPFR Global , a
research firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The pace of
outflows rose to the highest level in five weeks, managing
director  Brad Durham  wrote in a note Oct. 7. EPFR tracks global
funds managing $13 trillion in total assets.  Technical analysts who use the Fibonacci ratios say the
price of an asset tends to reverse an earlier gain or decline
after reaching certain levels. Among those thresholds are the
midpoint between an asset’s high and low points as well as
levels marking the recovery of 61.8 percent, 38.2 percent and
23.6 percent of reversals of the previous trend.  Strategists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast, on average,
that the S&P 500 will end the year at 1,195, short of the 61.8
percent retracement level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
