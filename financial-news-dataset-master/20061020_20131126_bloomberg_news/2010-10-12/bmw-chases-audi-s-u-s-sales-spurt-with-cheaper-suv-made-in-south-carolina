Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s largest maker of luxury cars, is revamping its X3 model
to catch up with  Volkswagen AG ’s Audi in the U.S. market for
small sport-utility vehicles.  The compact SUV, which goes on sale in the U.S. on Jan. 22,
will bulk up, adding more than 3 inches in length and 1 inch in
width, and be sold at a lower price, to take on the  Audi Q5 . The
current X3’s sticker price of $38,850 is $3,650 above the Q5.  “It’s a Q5 segment now,” said  Jim Hall , principal of
consulting firm 2953 Analytics in Birmingham, Michigan. “BMW
has to get their position back, and that’s tough to do.”  The X3, which exploited a niche for small, upscale SUVs
when it was introduced in 2004, has since fallen behind. Nine-
month U.S. deliveries of the Q5 jumped 78 percent to 16,636
vehicles, making it Audi’s second-best seller in the country
after the A4 sedan. The X3’s nine-month U.S. sales dropped 1.2
percent to 5,036 as consumers wait for the new version.  The overhauled X3, offering optional in-car Internet
access, will have a starting price of $37,625,  Jim O’Donnell ,
BMW’s U.S. chief, told reporters today at the carmaker’s factory
in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where BMW is shifting X3
production. BMW will begin selling the X1 SUV in the U.S. in
2011, he said.  Reviving sales of the small SUVs is part of BMW’s push to
overtake Toyota Motor Corp.’s Lexus in U.S. luxury-car sales.
The German carmaker’s U.S. sales rose 9.2 percent to 157,464
vehicles through September. Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz nine-
month deliveries climbed 18 percent to 159,729 cars and SUVs.
Lexus remained the U.S. leader with purchases of 162,438.  Closing Gap  “We feel comfortable that we’ll close the gap” to Lexus and
Mercedes for the rest of 2010 and into next year with the X3 and
new 5-series sedan, O’Donnell said. BMW today forecast U.S.
sales will gain 10 percent this year and 15 percent in 2011.  BMW shifted global production of the X3 to Spartanburg from
Graz, Austria, to reduce currency exposure and make the SUV more
competitive in the U.S., where Lexus has been the top-selling
luxury brand since 2000.  Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer  is keen to re-
build U.S. operations after 2009 sales slumped 28 percent from
the pre-crisis high of 335,840 vehicles. BMW is looking for
“balanced” growth, and the U.S. is “very key” to these
plans, Reithofer said in an interview last month.  “The U.S. will remain the world’s largest premium market
for the foreseeable future and we intend to participate in the
expected growth with the expansion of our activities here,”
Reithofer said today in South Carolina, where BMW executives are
showing the X3 and discussing the carmaker’s U.S. strategy.  U.S. Investments  The maker of  BMW , Mini, and Rolls-Royce autos is investing
$750 million in the 16-year-old Spartanburg factory to
accommodate the X3, which will join the X5 and X6 SUVs at the
site. Following the expansion’s completion in 2012, capacity
will rise to 240,000 vehicles a year from 160,000, making it the
biggest BMW plant outside Europe. BMW exports SUVs from South
Carolina to more than 120 countries, including its home market.  BMW has  invested  $1 billion in its U.S. operations since
2008, including an expansion of the Spartanburg factory, new
distribution facilities, and a $100 million North American
headquarters in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. BMW also has a
design unit, emissions testing, and technology lab in California
as well as a financial subsidiary in Ohio.  BMW may add another model in Spartanburg and expand the
plant further, Reithofer said today, adding that the carmaker
has no plans to add an engine factory at the facility.  Cultural Influence  “The U.S. is definitely important above and beyond the
size of the market,” said  Juergen Meyer , a Frankfurt-based fund
manager with SEB Asset Management whose top holding is BMW
shares. “American culture and the American way of life
influence people around the world, so for the image, it’s
important to be successful there.”  BMW will use the introduction of the X3 to renew a push for
Americans to custom build their cars. The effort will feature
images of the customer’s vehicle as it’s produced. The video
clips will be taken from seven stages of the production process
and uploaded to a personalized website, said Kenn Sparks, a
spokesman for BMW’s U.S. operations.  Moving production to Spartanburg makes the program possible
because of shorter delivery times and a production process that
allows buyers to make changes to the vehicle order as late as
six days before the assembly date, said Sparks.  Profit Generator  Audi, VW’s biggest profit generator, is expanding the Q5
range in the U.S. by adding a fuel-efficient, four-cylinder
engine for the 2011 model year, and a hybrid version later in
the year, said  Esther Bahne , a spokeswoman for the VW unit.
Inventory averaged 15 days for the Q5 compared with normal
levels of 45 to 55 days, she said.  Ingolstadt, Germany-based Audi is targeting U.S. deliveries
of at least 100,000 this year, surpassing the 2007 record of
93,506 vehicles. The Q5 went on sale in the U.S. in March 2009.  The  RX 350 , Lexus’s smallest SUV, starts at $37,625,
according to the carmaker’s website. Nine-month RX sales in the
U.S. gained 4.4 percent to 67,896 vehicles.  “We intend to fight for and achieve leadership in the
segment” from 2011, O’Donnell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
