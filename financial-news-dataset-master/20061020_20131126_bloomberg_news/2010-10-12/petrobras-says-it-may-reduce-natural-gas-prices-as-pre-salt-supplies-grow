Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, said it may cut the price it
charges for natural gas because of an increase in supply from
the pre-salt crude oil fields.  The company will start renegotiating gas contracts in 2011
and long-term prices are likely to be lower than the current
ones, Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
said yesterday on its  blog  in response to an O Estado de S.
Paulo article that said the company may reduce rates.  Petrobras said gas produced in Brazil is more expensive
than Bolivian imports because of the real’s appreciation.
Bolivian gas is priced in U.S. dollars, while the Brazilian
product is priced in reais, Petrobras said.  The company said the average rate for its short- and long-
term gas contracts last month was about $7.72 per million
British thermal units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
