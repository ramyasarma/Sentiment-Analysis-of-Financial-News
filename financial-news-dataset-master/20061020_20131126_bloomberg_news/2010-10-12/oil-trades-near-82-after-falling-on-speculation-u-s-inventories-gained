Oil rose in New York for the first
time in three days as the dollar extended losses, bolstering the
investment appeal of commodities, and amid speculation U.S. fuel
supplies declined.  Crude climbed as much as 0.5 percent as the  Dollar Index ,
which tracks the U.S. currency against major trading partners,
traded near its lowest since January on bets the Federal Reserve
will resume bond purchases to boost growth. Fuel stockpiles held
by the U.S., the world’s biggest oil user, fell last week,
according to Bloomberg News survey before an Energy Department
report tomorrow.  “Around $80 is a reasonable price for producing countries
and consumers, so the direction of the oil market is being
determined by the U.S. dollar,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity
derivative sales manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo. “While we
can see high inventories still, the market is expecting growing
demand in the next year.”  Crude for November delivery rose as much as 42 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $82.09 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $82.07 at 10:39 a.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract fell 54 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $81.67. Futures are up 3.3 percent in 2010.  The Dollar Index, used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and Swiss franc, slid 0.3 percent to 77.17 today. It touched
76.906 on Oct. 7, the lowest since Jan. 15.  OPEC Output  Oil lost 1 percent in the past two days amid speculation
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will maintain
production targets at a meeting tomorrow in Vienna. The 12-
member group pumps 40 percent of the world’s crude.  Saudi Arabia’s oil minister  Ali al-Naimi , whose country is
the largest OPEC producer, said Oct. 11 the global market was
“very well-balanced” and crude prices between $70 and $80 a
barrel were “ideal.”  Yesterday, OPEC raised its forecast for global oil demand
this year by 100,000 barrels a day to 85.59 million, from 84.46
million in 2009. Consumption will increase 1.2 percent to 86.64
million barrels a day in 2011, the group said in its monthly Oil
Market Report.  Brent crude for November settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange gained as much as 38 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $83.88 a barrel. Yesterday, the contract fell 22
cents, or 0.3 percent, to $83.50.  Fuel Supplies  U.S.  gasoline  stockpiles are expected to have dropped 1.5
million barrels in the week to Oct. 8, based on the median
estimate from 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Distillate
fuel  inventories, including diesel and heating oil, probably
decreased 1.2 million barrels.  Commercially held  crude  inventories rose 1.4 million
barrels last week, the survey showed. Stockpiles reached 360.9
million previously, 13 percent above the five-year average level.  “There is demand, but it remains relatively tepid,” said
 Ben Westmore , minerals and energy economist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “Then couple that with the
fact that stocks of oil are still at very high levels, so the
fundamental situation looks pretty weak.”  The Energy Department will release its Weekly Petroleum
Status Report tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Washington, a day later
than usual because of the Columbus Day holiday Oct. 11. The
industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will issue its
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
