Some family offices may continue to
be exempt from regulation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the agency said.  The  SEC  proposed a rule today that would allow family
offices that provide investment advice only to family members
and key employees, and are owned and controlled by family
members to be exempt from regulation by the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, according to a statement from the agency.  Family offices are entities established by wealthy families
to manage their money and provide services such as tax and
estate planning. Single offices, which generally serve families
with at least $100 million in investable assets, typically
haven’t had to register with the SEC because of an exemption
provided to advisers with fewer than 15 clients. The financial
overhaul bill signed by President Barack Obama  July 21 removed
the exemption to permit the SEC to regulate hedge fund and other
private-fund advisers.  There are from 2,500 to 3,000 single-family offices
managing more than $1.2 trillion in assets, the SEC said in its
proposed rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
