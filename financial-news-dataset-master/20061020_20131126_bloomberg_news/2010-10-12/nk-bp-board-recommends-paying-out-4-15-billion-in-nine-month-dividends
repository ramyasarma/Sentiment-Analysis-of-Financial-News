OAO TNK-BP Holding, the publicly
traded unit of BP Plc’s joint venture with a group of Russian
billionaires, may pay the company’s highest dividend since 2006
after a recommendation by its board.  The board recommended a nine-month dividend of 8.04 rubles
a share, or a total payout of 124.2 billion rubles ($4.15
billion), the Russian oil producer said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The dividend payment, mainly to the Novy Investments Ltd.
unit owned by BP and the Russian shareholders, will be used
primarily to finance TNK-BP’s exploration, production and
refining and marketing activities, according to the statement  The company has not recommended a dividend this high since
2006, Thomas Kiehn a TNK-BP spokesman, said in an e-mail.  TNK-BP will bid for BP assets in Vietnam, Venezuela and
Algeria to expand outside of Russia. The Moscow-based company
said last month it plans to increase spending on exploration and
production 52 percent in the next three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
