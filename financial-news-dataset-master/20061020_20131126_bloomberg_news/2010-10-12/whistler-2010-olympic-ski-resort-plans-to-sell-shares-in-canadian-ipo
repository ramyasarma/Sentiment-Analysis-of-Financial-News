Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc.,
owner of the Canadian ski resort that hosted the 2010 Winter
Olympics, plans to sell stock in an initial public offering.  The company will use the proceeds to repay debt owed to
Intrawest ULC, the selling shareholder, according to an Oct. 8
filing with Canadian regulators.  Whistler Blackcomb plans to list shares on the  Toronto
Stock Exchange  after the sale, which is being led by CIBC World
Markets, RBC Dominion Securities and eight other investment
banks. Terms of the sale weren’t disclosed in the filing.  Intrawest is a unit of New York-based  Fortress Investment
Group LLC,  the buyout and hedge-fund firm run by  Daniel Mudd .  To contact the reporter on this story:
