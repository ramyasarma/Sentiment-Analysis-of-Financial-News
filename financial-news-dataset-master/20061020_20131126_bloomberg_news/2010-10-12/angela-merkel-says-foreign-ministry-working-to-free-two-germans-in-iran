Chancellor Angela Merkel said that
the German Foreign Ministry is working to free two German
citizens arrested in Iran.  “We have a huge interest in trying to free them,” Merkel
told reporters in Bucharest today. “We are doing what we can
but we don’t have any new information” on the circumstances of
the the pair’s arrest.  Iran said yesterday that it arrested two foreign nationals
who entered the Persian Gulf country as tourists and interviewed
the son of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, an Iranian woman
sentenced to death by stoning. The International Committee
Against Stoning, a campaigning group, said the two German
citizens are journalists and were arrested in the northwestern
city of Tabriz along with the son, Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, and a
lawyer, Houtan Kian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
