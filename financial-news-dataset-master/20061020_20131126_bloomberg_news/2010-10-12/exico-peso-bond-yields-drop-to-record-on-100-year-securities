Mexico’s peso bonds rose for a
seventh day, pushing yields to a record low, as the sale of 100-
year securities by the nation fueled demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.258 percent at 5
p.m. New York time, according to Banco Santander SA, the lowest
level since the security was issued in 2005. The price rose 0.19
centavo to 135.08 centavos per peso. The yield has plunged 201
basis points this year.  “The 100-year bond offering is placing more confidence in
the nation,” said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader at Banco Ve
Por Mas SA in Mexico City. “The bonds are helping contribute to
a better long-term outlook.”  Mexico sold $1 billion of 100-year bonds last week, the
first such sale by a Latin American government. The yield on the
security has dropped 11 basis points to 5.684 percent since it
was issued last week, according to BNP Paribas etrading.  Yields on the benchmark peso debt may fall as much as nine
basis points to 6.15 percent by the end of the year, del Campo
said.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 12.4047 per dollar, from
12.4516 yesterday. The currency has risen 5.5 percent this year
against the dollar.  Industrial production gained 8.1 percent in August from a
year earlier, the national statistics agency said today. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for a gain of 6.3
percent.  The 100-year bond raises concern the credit market is
nearing a “bubble” that is blinding investors from making wise
choices, RBC Capital Markets said last week.  Central bank Governor  Agustin Carstens  said the debt won’t
lead to a bubble. The Mexican economy is “solid” and inflation
has been better than expected, he said in Mexico City today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
