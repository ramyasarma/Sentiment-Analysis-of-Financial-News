The Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences recommended the nation raise its annual inflation
target to 4 percent, the Shanghai Securities News reported.  A higher inflation target could help increase farmers’
incomes, reduce excess liquidity and alleviate pressure for an
appreciation of the yuan, the newspaper reported, citing a
report issued by the academy. China consumer price index may
gain 3 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 2011, the newspaper
reported. China set inflation growth targets of 3 percent for
both 2009 and 2010.  China’s industrial output will likely exceed 10 percent
next year, the newspaper reported, citing the academy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
