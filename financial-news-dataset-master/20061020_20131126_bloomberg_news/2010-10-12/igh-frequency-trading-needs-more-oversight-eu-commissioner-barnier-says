Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services commissioner, said high-frequency trading
needs more supervision and that he’ll work with the U.S. to
achieve that aim.  “High-frequency trading requires more supervision at this
juncture given the risks of how quickly the business evolves,”
Barnier told the World Federation of Exchange’s annual meeting
in Paris today. “I intend to work in conjunction with the
U.S.”  Barnier  said  last month he was taking a “very, very
close look” at high-frequency trading as part of a review of
the EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid.
The rule-changes are part of a wider overhaul of financial
regulation following the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression.  High-frequency trading entails hedge funds and other firms
using powerful technology and complex computer programs to
execute orders in milliseconds to profit from fleeting
discrepancies in the prices of shares across different trading
venues.  European markets also need to be more transparent and
regulators will work to crack down on market abuse and harmonize
rules across the region, Barnier said today.  Updated rules “will empower regulators further by
introducing a new rule on felony,” he said. “Intermediaries
will need to report suspicious orders. We don’t want orders that
aren’t executed.”  U.S. regulators said last month they’ll examine the role
high-frequency and algorithmic trading practices played in the
20-minute rout that briefly erased $862 billion in equity value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
