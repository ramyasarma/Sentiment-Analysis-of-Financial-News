Hungary’s government is working on
measures to ensure it reaches this year’s targeted budget
deficit target, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said.  Hungary, which has been unable to meet the European Union’s
deficit target of 3 percent of gross domestic product since it
joined the bloc in 2004, last month bowed to pressure from
Brussels to contain its shortfall.  Orban, who won elections in April promising to boost
 economic growth  at the expense of fiscal rigor, committed to
reducing the shortfall to 3.8 percent of GDP this year 2010 and
less than 3 percent in 2011, the levels set in Hungary’s 2008
bailout contract.  “We will meet our commitments,” he said in Pecs, Hungary
today. “We will enact measures over the coming days” for the
2010 budget. The country has a “good chance” to narrow the gap
to below 3 percent of GDP next year as even “the most cautious”
forecasts predict that the economy will expand in 2011, he said.  The forint fell 0.1 percent to 273.92 by 12:33 p.m. in
Budapest. The currency has gained 4.7 percent against the euro
since Orban’s pledge on Sept. 8, the best performance of about
170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “I’m very pleased by Hungary’s commitment to fiscal
consolidation,” European Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso  said at the press conference. “I have full confidence in
the determination of Prime Minister Orban and the government” to
reach those goals, he said.  The government’s fiscal measures won’t threaten economic
growth, which will be sustainable and based on job creation,
Orban said. Hungary’s  economy shrank  6.3 percent last year, the
biggest contraction in 18 years.  Hungary will take over the EU’s six-month rotating
presidency in January.  “It would be embarrassingly ridiculous if the country
holding the EU’s presidency would be unable to conform to the
economic laws of the union,” Orban said. “But we’re not such
unpleasant fellows” and Hungary will be one of the few countries
in the 27-member bloc to meet the deficit requirement in 2011.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
