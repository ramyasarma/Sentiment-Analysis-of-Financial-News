Lecico Egypt , a manufacturer of
bathroom fixtures and tiles, surged to a two-year high after
Electrolux AB offered to buy Egyptian household appliance
assembler Olympic Group, at a 50 percent premium.  Shares of the Alexandria, Egypt-based company rose for a
second day, jumping 6.8 percent to 17.98 Egyptian pounds at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the highest level since August, 2008.
The stock has gained 12 percent in two days after the  Olympic 
offer was announced.  “In a situation where you have Olympic Group receiving a
50 percent premium to its last traded price, I think we saw
today a knock-on effect driven primarily by retail investors,”
 Julian Bruce , director of equity sales at investment bank EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE, in Dubai said by telephone.  Stockholm-based  Electrolux , the owner of the Frigidaire
brand, said yesterday it had agreed to pay Olympic’s majority
shareholder, Paradise Capital Holding, 45.3 pounds per share.
Olympic closed at 30.06 pounds on Oct. 7, the last day it traded
before the announcement.  Lecico’s management has not made any decisions that would
affect its share price,  Taher Gargour , Lecico’s deputy chief
executive officer said by telephone from Cairo.  “We’re not sure what the reason is in the sudden
appreciation in the stock,” Gargour said. “Why there should be
a trigger now, I don’t know.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
