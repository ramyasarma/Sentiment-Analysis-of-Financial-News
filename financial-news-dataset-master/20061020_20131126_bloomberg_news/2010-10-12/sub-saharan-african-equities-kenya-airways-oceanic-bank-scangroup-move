Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index  climbed for
a seventh day, the longest streak of gains since July 15, rising
0.6 percent to close at 1,813.86 by 1:30 p.m. in Port Louis.  Kenya’s  All-Share Index  increased 0.1 percent to 81.59 by
the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index  added 0.7 percent to 24,430.2, data from the
exchange’s website show. That’s the highest close since Aug. 24,
according to Bloomberg data.  Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index  declined for the first
time in three days, retreating 0.1 percent to 812.46 by 2:45
p.m. in Windhoek, while the  Ghana Stock Exchange All-Share Index 
climbed for a second day, rising 0.2 percent to 6,846.73 by
12:46 p.m. in Accra.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Kenya Airways Ltd.  (KNAL KN), sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest airline, advanced the most in more than a week, climbing
1 shilling, or 2.3 percent, to 44.25 shillings. The Nairobi-
based Industrial Court yesterday issued an injunction to block a
planned strike at the request of Kenya Airways, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported today. Employees will decide today whether to
go ahead with an indefinite strike even after the court ruling,
said Bonne Nicholas Barasa, general-secretary of the Aviation
and Allied Workers’ Union.  Oceanic Bank International Plc  (OCEANIC NL), a Nigerian
lender, rose the most since Aug. 30, increasing 6 kobo, or 5
percent, to 1.27 naira. The central bank cut the stake in the
lender held by the family of  Cecilia Ibru , the former managing
director who was jailed last week for fraud, to 10 percent from
30 percent, ThisDay reported today, without saying where it got
the information.  Ibru agreed to forfeit 191.4 billion naira ($1.3 billion)
of assets after being convicted of bank fraud and sentenced to
18 months in jail by a Nigerian High Court on Oct. 8. The assets
include properties in the U.S., Dubai and Nigeria and shares in
100 companies, the Abuja-based bank said in a statement on its
website.  Scangroup Ltd.  (SCAN KN), East Africa’s biggest advertising
company, dropped the most since April 16, slumping 6 shillings,
or 8.3 percent, to 66.5 shillings. The company said it created
13.88 million new shares after getting the go-ahead to acquire
Ogilvy East Africa Ltd.  “As far as I can see, it has diluted,”  Jan Does de Willebois , head of equities at Nairobi-based Dyer & Blair
Investment Bank Ltd., said in an interview via Bloomberg chat
today. “Ogilvy is already in Africa’s largest countries. It
limits their expansion capabilities as Scangroup.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
