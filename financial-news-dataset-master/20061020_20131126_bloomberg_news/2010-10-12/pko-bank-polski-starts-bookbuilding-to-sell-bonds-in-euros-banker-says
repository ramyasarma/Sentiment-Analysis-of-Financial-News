PKO Bank Polski SA , Poland’s largest
lender, sold 800 million euros ($1.11 billion) of five-year
bonds after delaying its first offering of debt in the common
European currency earlier this month because markets were
volatile.  The bonds due 2015 were priced to yield 185 basis points
more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer  Jakub Papierski  said by phone. HSBC Holdings Plc and
Societe Generale SA organized the sale.  PKO got bids for more than 1 billion euro of the paper,
which carries a 3.733 percent coupon, Papierski said.  The sale by the bank based in Warsaw was first portion of a
3 billion-euro bond program announced in 2008 and PKO’s first-
ever euro-denominated debt, the lender said on Sept. 22.  State-owned PKO put off the sale, spokeswoman  Elzbieta Anders  said on Oct. 1, confirming a PAP report. The Polish news
service had quoted Papierski as saying the bank postponed the
offering because markets were “not too stable.”  PKO shares increased 0.3 percent to 44.75 zloty in Warsaw,
valuing the bank at 55.9 billion zloty ($20 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
