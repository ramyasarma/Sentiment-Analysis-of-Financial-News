The euro may retreat to $1.35 as a
technical indicator suggests its 11 percent gain in the past
month has been too rapid, according to Ueda Harlow Ltd.  The shared currency’s 14-day  relative strength index 
against the dollar has remained above 70 since Sept. 28, the
longest stretch since March 2008 and exceeding the level some
traders see as a sign an asset’s price is poise to change
direction. The euro reached an eight-month high of $1.4029 on
Oct. 7 from as low as $1.2644 in September amid speculation the
Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy further.  “Given the euro has gained at a fast pace and reached
$1.40, there will be some selling,” said  Toshiya Yamauchi , a
senior currency analyst in Tokyo at Ueda Harlow. “The euro may
fall to about $1.35.”  The Fed is scheduled to release today minutes of its policy
meeting on Sept. 21, when the central bank said it was willing
to do more to sustain the U.S. economic recovery. Payrolls fell
by 95,000 workers in the U.S. last month, a Labor Department
report showed on Oct. 8, while economists had estimated a 5,000
drop. The Fed will next meet on Nov. 2-3.  “The U.S. job market isn’t in good shape, so the Fed may
continue to ease policy even after its meeting next month,”
Yamauchi said. “The dollar will remain prone to weakness.”  The 16-nation euro traded at $1.3857 as of 10:07 a.m. in
Tokyo.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
