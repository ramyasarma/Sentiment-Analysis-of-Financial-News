  Straits Resources Ltd ., the
Australian mining company that sold coal and nickel assets in
the past year, said it’s been approached to sell its remaining
S$489 million ($374 million) share in an Indonesian coal miner.  Straits is considering spinning off its effective 18.2
percent stake in  Straits Asia Resources Ltd . to concentrate on
its copper and gold assets, Milan Jerkovic, the chief executive
officer of the Perth-based company, said today in an interview
in Sydney, without identifying the potential buyers.  Interest in Straits Asia, which produced 10.5 million
metric tons of energy coal last year, has been driven by  India ’s
growing coal demand as its electricity use increases, Jerkovic
said. Thermal coal prices, set annually, rose 40 percent this
year to $98 a ton, according to an Oct. 6 Morgan Stanley report.  “We have been approached by a number of different
parties,” said Jerkovic, who added he expects the “tidy up”
of the stake to be complete within 12 months. Divesting the coal
assets will better reflect the value of Straits Resources’s
producing and exploration copper assets in  Australia , he said.  Straits Resources closed unchanged at A$1.85 at 4:10 p.m.
in Sydney, after climbing 42 percent since June 30, giving it a
market value of A$472 million ($462 million). Straits Asia,
unchanged at S$2.39 at 1:39 p.m. in  Singapore , has climbed 20
percent since June 30, taking its market value to S$2.7 billion.  Increasing Output  Straits Resources’s plans to split its coal and metal
assets in 2008 were stalled by the global financial crisis,
Jerkovic said. Instead, the company sold the majority of its
share in Straits Asia to PTT Pcl,  Thailand ’s biggest energy
company. It now holds a 40 percent stake in PTT Asia Pacific
Mining Pty, which owns 45.6 percent of Straits Asia.  Coal output at Straits Asia may rise to 18 million tons on
an annualized basis from June 2011, Jerkovic said. The Sebuku
mine in  Indonesia , which produced 1.49 million tons in the year
to June 2010, may increase to 8 million tons of capacity, he
said, expecting a mine permit to be granted by December this
year and a six month ramp up period.  The Australian company owns the Tritton copper operations
in Australia and the Mount Muro gold mine in Indonesia.  Copper output at Tritton in New South Wales state is
expected to increase to 27,000 tons from 21,000 tons for fiscal
2011-12 after a A$50 million recapitalization program due to
conclude in March next year.  The company also owns 67 percent of Vancouver-based copper
explorer Goldminco Corp. that is exploring for copper in
Australia’s Lachlan Ford Belt in New South Wales with a view to
building a 100,000-ton annual output copper operation in the
next five years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
