The won retreated from a five-month
high after Japan said it is prepared to intervene to combat
currency gains, spurring speculation the Bank of Korea will
follow suit to protect exports.  South Korea’s currency dropped the most in seven weeks
after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda reiterated the
government is prepared to take “bold” action following the yen’s
advance to a 15-year high versus the dollar. The  Kospi  stock
index fell for a fourth day, its longest losing streak since
August, as overseas investors sold more shares than they bought
for the first time in a month.  “It looks like Japan is not necessarily done on
intervention and the fact that the yen has fallen below the
initial intervention level doesn’t mean they are finished with
it,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. in Sydney. “That is supporting the dollar against
the yen and has impacted some other pairs as well.”  The won fell 0.8 percent to 1,125.26 per dollar as of 9:59
a.m. in Seoul, paring its gain for the past three months to 7.1
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It yesterday
reached 1,110.75, the strongest level since May 3.  The yen traded at 82.23 per dollar, stronger than the 82.88
reached on Sept. 15, when Japan confirmed its first intervention
in the currency since 2004. The won pared gains that day
following Japan’s announcement amid speculation the Bank of
Korea would also sell its currency and buy dollars.  Government bonds fell for a second day. The yield on the
3.75 percent debt due June 2013 rose one basis points to 3.29
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
