Policy makers of the Group of 20
should consider a variety of measures including interest rates
and taxes to keep currencies stable when they meet in Seoul next
month, Bank of Italy Director General  Fabrizio Saccomanni  said
in interviews with Italian newspapers.  “All the economic policy tools have to be used in a
coordinated and consistent way: interest rates, fiscal measures
such as taxes on capital flows, interventions on exchange rates
and the Financial Stability Board’s measures,” Saccomani was
quoted as saying. Corriere della Sera, la Repubblica and Sole 24
Ore published interviews with the central banker.  The International Monetary Fund should play an important
role in any effort by the Group of 20 to influence the currency
markets, though its governance should be reformed, Saccomanni
told la Repubblica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
