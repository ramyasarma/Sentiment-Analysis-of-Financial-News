Codelco , the world’s largest copper
producer, is boosting the premium charged to European metal
buyers for the first time in two years, according to a person
with direct knowledge of the matter.  The surcharge, added to  copper for immediate delivery  on
the London Metal Exchange to cover costs such as shipping and
insurance, will rise 23 percent to $98 a ton next year, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
confidential. The 2010 surcharge was unchanged at $80 a ton.  Copper for three-month delivery on the LME, a benchmark
contract, rose 12 percent this year and reached a 27-month high
yesterday as demand improves from the worst recession since
World War II. Codelco Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez 
said today he expects a “tighter” copper market next year
because of continued demand from China and a lack of new supply.  Codelco can charge more “given market conditions being as
tight as they are on the concentrate side,”  Alex Heath , head of
industrial-metals trading at Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd. in
London, said today in a telephone interview.  Copper consumption will outpace supply this year by 58,000
metric tons because of rising demand and supply disruptions,
 Leon Westgate , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc. said in a
report. The metal will have a shortage of 199,000 tons next year
and about 457,000 tons in 2012, according to Westgate.  China Demand  “China is continuing to have a strong demand and from the
supply side we have only a couple of new projects coming on-
stream,” Hernandez said today in an interview in London.  Hernandez declined to comment on Codelco’s premium charges,
citing company policy.  Copper rose $49.50, or 0.6 percent, to $8,339.50 a ton at
4:23 p.m. in London. Prices reached a record $8,940 in July
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
