Norway’s krone fell against the euro
after a report yesterday that showed  inflation  accelerated less
than forecast in September fanned speculation the central bank
won’t boost interest rates.  The krone also dropped versus the dollar. The report showed
underlying inflation rose 0.7 percent in September, compared
with a 0.9 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Sweden’s krona fell against the dollar after the nation lowered
its economic outlook for next year.  “Ahead of the 27 October monetary policy meeting, the
krone may continue to suffer,”  Arne Lohmann Rasmussen , head of
currency research at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen, wrote in a
note today. “The latest string of weak numbers has made another
downward revision to Norges Bank’s interest-rate path likely.”  The krona dropped 0.4 percent to 6.6991 per dollar as of
3:32 p.m. in Stockholm. It fell 0.1 percent to 9.2716 per euro.
The Swedish krone fell 0.3 percent to 8.1370 per euro and
dropped 0.7 percent to 5.8843 per dollar.  Sweden’s gross domestic product will expand 3.7 percent in
2011 and 3.4 percent the year after, the government said in a
budget report released in Stockholm today. That compares with an
Aug. 20 estimate for 4 percent growth in 2011.  The krone fell even after a report today showed inflation
last month increased more than most analysts forecast. Consumer
prices increased 1.4 percent in September from last year,
beating the 1.3 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
