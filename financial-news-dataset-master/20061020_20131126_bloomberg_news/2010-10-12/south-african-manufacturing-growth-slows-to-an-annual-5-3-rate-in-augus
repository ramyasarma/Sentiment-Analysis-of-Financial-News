South African  manufacturing  growth
unexpectedly slowed to an annual 5.3 percent in August as the
rand’s rally and weaker European demand undermined exports in
Africa’s biggest economy.  Factory output, which accounts for 15 percent of the
economy, had gained a revised 7.2 percent in July, Pretoria-
based  Statistics South Africa  said on its website today. The
median estimate of nine economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg was 8.6
percent.  Output  fell a seasonally adjusted 3.6 percent in the
month.  The  rand  has surged 11 percent against the dollar since
June 1, crimping export earnings for manufacturers such as  AVI
Ltd. , South Africa’s second-largest food company. The currency’s
gains have also improved the inflation outlook, prompting the
Reserve Bank to cut its benchmark interest  rate  by half a
percentage point to 6 percent on Sept. 9, the eighth reduction
since December 2008.  “Rand strength and weakening global industrial production
will keep risks to manufacturing production for exports on the
downside,”  Shireen Darmalingam , an economist at Standard Bank
Group Ltd., Africa’s biggest lender, said in a note to clients
before today’s data.  The  Purchasing Managers Index , an indicator of
manufacturing output, fell below 50 in September, signaling a
contraction in production, Kagiso Securities Ltd. said Oct. 1.  Johannesburg-based AVI said on Sept. 6 that revenue at its
fishing unit, Irvin and Johnson, will “remain depressed” if
the rand’s strength persists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
