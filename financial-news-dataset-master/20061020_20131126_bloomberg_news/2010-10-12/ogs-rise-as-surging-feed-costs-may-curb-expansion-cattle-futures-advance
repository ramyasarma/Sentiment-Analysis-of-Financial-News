Hog futures rose as corn costs at
the highest level in two years may spur farmers to feed
livestock less and slow herd expansion. Cattle futures jumped to
a one-week high.  Corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed, has surged 16
percent since Oct. 7, the day before the U.S. Department of
Agriculture cut its crop estimate more than analysts expected.
Hog prices are up 11 percent this year.  “The bullish news is the price of grain, the price of
feed,” said  Lawrence Kane , a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson
Group in Yates City, Illinois. “They won’t feed hogs to as
heavy a weight.”  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.15 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at 72.775 cents a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price gained as much
as 0.8 percent.  Cattle futures for December delivery advanced 0.55 cent, or
0.6 percent, to settle at 99.3 cents a pound. Earlier, the price
reached 99.65, the highest level for a most-active contract
since Oct. 1. The commodity has gained 15 percent in 2010.  “Feed costs will eventually turn finish weights lower and
lower the supply of beef,” Kane said.  Yesterday, wholesale  choice-beef  prices rose 0.7 percent to
$1.5293 a pound, the biggest gain since Aug. 20, according to
government data. At midday, prices were down 0.2 percent.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement added 0.125
cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.0725 a pound, the first gain in
seven sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
