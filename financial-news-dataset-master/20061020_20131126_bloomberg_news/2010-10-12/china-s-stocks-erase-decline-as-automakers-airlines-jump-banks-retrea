China’s stocks erased declines as a
rally for automakers and airlines offset a drop for financial
companies amid policy tightening concerns.  The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 2,809.26
at 10:30 a.m. local time, while the CSI 300 Index added 0.5
percent to 3,147.90. SAIC Motor Corp. led a rally for automakers
after it estimated profit may have jumped as much as 140 percent
in the first nine months, while Xinhua News reported auto sales
in China may reach 17 million units this year, up 25 percent
from last year.  Air China Ltd. and China Southern Airlines Co. rose more
than 5 percent after China Business News reported China National
Aviation Fuel Group reduced the price of jet kerosene for use on
domestic flights.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
