Adidas AG , the world’s second-
biggest sporting-goods maker,  fell the most  in more than three
months in Frankfurt trading after CNBC said the company’s Reebok
unit may lose a contract with the  National Football League .  Adidas declined as much as 3.3 percent, the most since June
29. The shares were down 52 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 46.57
euros at 1:40 p.m. local time.  Adidas, which bought Reebok in 2006, wants to make the unit
more profitable by repositioning it as a fitness-apparel and
shoe specialist. Reebok is also the official supplier of jerseys
to the National Hockey League.  Larger competitor  Nike Inc.  may become the official apparel
maker for the New York-based NFL beginning in 2012, CNBC
reported yesterday, citing unidentified people familiar with the
situation. The deal may last for five years, according to CNBC.  “Reebok’s NFL contract represents about $350 million of
its $565 million in U.S. apparel revenues,”  Kate McShane , an
analyst at Citigroup in New York, wrote in a note to investors
yesterday. If Nike assumes the entire contract, the company’s
earnings per share could increase by 9 cents or grow as much as
3 percent in 2012, she said.  Adidas spokeswoman  Katja Schreiber  declined to comment on
today’s report and wouldn’t give an estimate of NFL-related
sales.  “If we lose the NFL it won’t make or break our company,”
Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer  told CNBC Sept. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
