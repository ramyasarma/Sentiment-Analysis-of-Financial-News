Investors in the initial share sale
by Nawras, the Omani mobile phone company controlled by Qatar
Telecom QSC, are showing a pricing preference between 702 baisas
and 802 baisas a share, the market regulator said in a statement
on the Muscat bourse website.  “The Capital Market Authority received a letter from Omani
Qatari Telecommunications Co., or Nawras, advising that the
Nawras IPO has received a very positive response from
institutional investors in the Sultanate of Oman as well as
international investors in excess of the total shares on
offer,” according to the statement. “Current indications
received from the majority of institutional investors are
showing a pricing preference between 702 and 802 baisas per
share.”  Nawras set a range of 702 baisas to 902 baisas a share in
its book-built IPO that opened Sept. 15 and will run for a
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
