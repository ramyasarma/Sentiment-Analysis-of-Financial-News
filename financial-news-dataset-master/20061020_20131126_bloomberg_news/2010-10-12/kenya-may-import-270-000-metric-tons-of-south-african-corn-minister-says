Kenya  may import between 180,000 and
270,000 tons of corn from South Africa this year to cover an
expected shortfall, according to  Gideon Ndambuki , assistant
minister for agriculture.  “We will be having a shortfall,” he said in an interview
in Johannesburg today. Corn is Kenya’s staple food and South
Africa is the largest grower on the continent. The amount is
equivalent to between two and three million 90-kilogram (198
pounds) bags of the grain, the measurement used in Kenya.  The Cereal Growers Association in Kenya said on Sept. 13
that corn production may fall as much as 20 percent in the year
because of expected poor rains between October and December.
Output may decline from an earlier estimate of 30 million bags,
said  David Nyameino , chief executive officer of the association.  Per-capita consumption of corn is 97 kilograms a year,
according to the United Nations’  Food and Agriculture
Organization . Kenya plans to irrigate 94,000 hectares (232,000
acres) of land over five years and invite foreign farmers to the
nation to try to expand commercial farming, Ndambuki said. About
20 percent of agriculture is on a commercial scale now, he said.  In the marketing year that began May 1 Kenya has imported
40,677 tons of white corn from South Africa. In the previous
marketing season Kenya bought 837,315 tons, making it the
biggest market for South African corn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
