France’s CAC 40 Index dropped 19.63,
or 0.5 percent, to 3,748.86 in Paris. The SBF 120 Index also
declined 0.5 percent to 2,797.19.  The following shares rose or fell in the French capital.
Stock symbols are in parentheses.  ArcelorMittal  (MT NA), the world’s biggest steelmaker,
retreated 0.8 percent to 24.66 euros. Posco, the third-largest,
cut its full-year profit forecast by 7 percent and reported the
first decline in earnings in four quarters.  Audika SA  (ADI FP) tumbled 6.8 percent to 17.99 euros, the
biggest retreat in almost three months. The French hearing-aid
retailer said third-quarter revenue fell to 19.8 million euros
($27.5 million) from 20.7 million euros a year earlier.       Electricite de France SA  (EDF FP) lost 2.2 percent to 30.69
euros. France is considering lifting electricity prices two
months after the last increase to pay for the rising cost of
solar-power development, Les Echos reported, citing an
unidentified official. A decision is imminent, the newspaper
cited the person as saying.  Separately, a person with knowledge of the matter said EDF,
the largest shareholder in Constellation Energy Group Inc.,
would support the sale of the company as relations between the
partners sour.  Ipsen SA  (IPN FP) dropped 1.2 percent to 24.71 euros. The
family-controlled drugmaker named  Marc de Garidel  chairman and
chief executive officer, replacing  Jean-Luc Belingard  who is
leaving the group over “strategic differences,” the company
said.       L’Oreal SA  (OR FP) declined 0.1 percent to 81.56 euros, a
fourth straight loss. Avon Products Inc., the world’s largest
door-to-door cosmetics seller, is attracting interest from
several companies, including L’Oreal, which may be lining up a
cash offer of more than $44 a share, the Daily Mail said in its
market report column.  Stephanie Carson-Parker , a spokeswoman for
L’Oreal, declined to comment.  Michelin & Cie.  (ML FP), the world’s second-largest
tiremaker, rose 3 percent to 57.25 euros. Tomorrow is the last
day of trading of the company’s rights for new shares. About 16
percent of the shares outstanding have been borrowed, according
to Data Explorers, likely by arbitragers who bought the rights.  Rodriguez Group  (ROD FP) jumped 7 percent to 5.35 euros.
The French luxury-yacht maker named Eric de Saintdo as chief
executive officer and said  Gerard Rodriguez  will remain
chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
