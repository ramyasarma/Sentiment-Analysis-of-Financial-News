Dexia SA , the lender that received a
6 billion-euro ($8.3 billion) bailout during the credit crisis,
plans to increase pretax  profit  by 2014 as it boosts revenue in
consumer banking.  The lender aims to reach a pretax profit of 1.8 billion
euros in 2014, compared with about 1.4 billion euros last year,
Chief Executive Officer  Pierre Mariani  said. He didn’t give a
forecast for 2010.  “There is a big change in the DNA of the group, with a
rebalancing towards retail banking,” Mariani told journalists
in Brussels. “Now we are able to design the common house that
Dexia will be in 2014.”  Dexia, once the largest lender to local governments, aims
to generate about 60 percent of its 2014 revenue in consumer
banking as it seeks to attract more deposits in Turkey. The bank
has cut lending to governments following the financial crisis.  The lender is planning to increase the number of Turkish
branches to at least 800 in 2014, from about 500 this year and
said the country may generate about 600 million euros of pretax
profit in 2014, as much as its Belgian and Luxembourg branches
combined.  Second-quarter net income in 2010 dropped to 248 million
euros from 283 million euros a year earlier, hurt by a charge in
Slovakia, the Paris- and Brussels-based lender said Aug. 6. CEO
Mariani said in February that profit may fall this year.  Selling Units  The bank agreed earlier this year to sell units in Italy,
Spain and Slovakia to gain European Union approval for the
taxpayer bailout. Dexia said last month that it’s planning to
cut an additional 2 percent of its staff to achieve a three-year
plan to save 600 million euros by the end of 2011.  The start of the sale of its Turkish insurance unit is
“imminent,” Mariani said, without naming any potential buyers.
The company will seek partners to continue distributing
insurance products to clients in the country, he said.  Dexia  shares  declined 0.9 percent to 3.33 euros as of 10:02
a.m. in Brussels, giving the company a market value of about 6.1
billion euros.  The lender forecasts a common equity ratio, a key measure
of financial strength, above 9 percent in 2014 under new Basel
III capital rules and said it’s targeting a core Tier 1 ratio of
about 15 percent under Basel II that year, assuming a  dividend 
payout of 30 percent from 2012.  Banque Postale Talks  Dexia and La Banque Postale, the banking unit of France’s
state-owned postal service, are in advanced talks to create a
joint-venture in local-governments financing, daily Le Figaro
reported on Sept. 29, citing an unidentified person.  “I’ve never made a mystery of my intentions to look at ways
to diversify funding,” Mariani said, confirming talks with
Banque Postale and adding the company will make an announcement
if they succeed.  The lender, which aims to shrink its balance sheet 35
percent by 2014, is also facing a two-year ban on takeovers and
paying cash dividends. At the end of 2008, Dexia started
unwinding 191 billion euros of assets, including bond holdings,
a pool of asset-backed securities and government loans
outstanding in markets that it’s exiting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
