             Bloomberg's Rich Jaroslovsky comments
on the return of the Internet browser battles.  
 Starting next month, the European Union will require 
customers who buy new computers in Europe to be presented with a
screen at startup listing a dozen browsers in random order, and 
given a choice of which and how many they want to install. The 
result is Google Inc., with its Chrome browser, and other 
software makers are making a major push to cut into the dominant
position of Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer. (Source:
