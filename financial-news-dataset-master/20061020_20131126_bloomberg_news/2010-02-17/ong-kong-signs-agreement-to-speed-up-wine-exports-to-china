             Hong Kong reached an agreement with
China’s customs agency that will speed up the export of wines
into the growing mainland market, the city government said.  
 Assessment of the value of China-bound wine shipments and
the amount of duty due to mainland authorities will be made
before the cargo leaves the city, according to a Hong Kong
government statement. It cited speeches by Donald Tong, head of
the city’s trade promotion agency in the U.S., where he met
local lawmakers and wine producers.  
 Hong Kong and mainland China are governed by different laws
under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle that
underpinned the city’s reversion to Chinese rule in 1997.  
 Two years after Hong Kong scrapped its 40 percent duties on
the beverage, the city has overtaken London as the world’s
second-biggest wine-auction market after New York, Tong said.
Last year, Hong Kong sold $64 million worth of wine in 14
auctions. The city’s 2009 imports of the beverage rose 41
percent to $517 million, the statement said.
