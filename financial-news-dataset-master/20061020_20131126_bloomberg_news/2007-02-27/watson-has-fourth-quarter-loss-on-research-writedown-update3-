             Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI)  Inc., the
biggest U.S. maker of generic drugs, reported a fourth-quarter
loss on the writedown of in-process research and development
after its $1.9 billion acquisition of Andrx Corp.  
 The net loss was $489 million, or $4.80 a share, compared
with net income of $20.1 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier,
Corona, California-based Watson said today in a statement.
Revenue rose 48 percent to $621.2 million, including about two
months of Andrx sales.  
 Watson bought Andrx in November to gain a drug-distribution
business and technology used in making copies of controlled-
release medicines. Watson has struggled to introduce new products
and faces questions about how it will integrate Andrx, which
hasn't been able to get any drugs approved since regulators found
problems at a plant in 2005.  
 Watson's earnings include $498 million in non-cash expenses
related to the writedown of research acquired with Andrx.
Excluding acquisition, litigation and impairment charges, Watson
said it would have earned 25 cents a share. That missed the 29-
cent average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
average revenue forecast was $592 million.  
 Watson shares were unchanged at $28.07 at 5:57 p.m. in
trading after the close of the  New York  Stock Exchange. The stock
has declined 7.5 percent in 12 months, compared with a 2.1
percent gain in the 56-member Standard & Poor's 500 Health-Care
Index.  
 Investors are still waiting for Watson to introduce copies
of Johnson & Johnson's pain patch Duragesic and GlaxoSmithKline
Plc's nasal spray Flonase. Watson Chief Executive Officer Allen Chao had said in November that he was confident that the two
generics would win regulatory approval before the end of 2006.  
 Chao said Watson is now taking a ``conservative'' approach
to forecasting 2007 earnings by including sales from only one of
these two drugs. Earnings, before interest, depreciation,
amortization, taxes and one-time charges, will be $1.20 to $1.30
a share, on revenue of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, Watson said.  
 The company's sales of generic drugs rose 31 percent in the
fourth quarter to $421.2 million, helped by the introduction of
copies of Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s birth-control pill
Seasonale and increased sales of generic versions of Purdue
Pharma Inc.'s painkiller OxyContin. Watson makes 275 generic and
37 branded medicines, according to its Web site.  
 Watson, including Andrx, is the largest U.S. maker of
generic drugs on the basis of 2005 revenue, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Barr, based in  Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey ,
ranks second and is set to report its 2006 figures tomorrow.
