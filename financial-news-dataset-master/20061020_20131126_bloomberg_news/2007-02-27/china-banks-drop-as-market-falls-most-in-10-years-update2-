             Industrial & Commercial Bank of China 
Ltd. and other Chinese financial stocks plunged on concern the
government will clamp down on lending to cool share price gains
and corporate investment.  
 ICBC, the nation's biggest bank, fell 8 percent to 4.69  yuan .
Citic Securities Co., the largest publicly traded brokerage,
tumbled 9.7 percent to close at 36.21 yuan.  China  Life Insurance
Co., the nation's biggest insurer, shed 9 percent to 33.89 yuan.  
 Financial stocks fell along with the wider market, which
recorded its biggest tumble in a decade. China's benchmark stock
index rose to a  record  yesterday, and banking shares have climbed
to unsustainable levels, said fund manager Chris Tang. China's
central bank on Feb. 16 forced banks to set aside more money as
reserves to cool lending growth.  
 ``The gains have been excessive,'' said Tang, a  fund manager 
at Marco Polo Investments Group, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund
that invests in yuan-denominated shares. ``It's natural that they
went down.''  
 Chinese government is trying to shield the banking system
from volatility created by the nation's booming stock market,
where the total value of shares more than tripled in the past
year to $1 trillion.  
 China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered banks to stop
lending for stock investments and to recall any outstanding share
loans, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg News on Jan.
12. Banks were required to gather more information on the
purposes of personal loans to prevent them being used for buying
shares.  
 Task Force  
 The State Council approved a special  task force  yesterday to
clamp down on illegal share offerings and other banned activities
in the stock market.  
 The Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index, which tracks yuan-
denominated A  shares  listed on China's two exchanges, lost 9.2
percent to 2457.49. The measure, which jumped 13 percent in the
past six sessions, closed at a record 2707.68 yesterday.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China's stock exchanges, plunged 8.8 percent to 2771.79 in its
biggest drop since Feb. 18, 1997. The Shenzhen Composite Index,
which covers the smaller exchange, dropped 8.5 percent to 709.81.
The index has surged 29 percent far this year.  
 Share Sales  
 Financial companies, including ICBC,  Bank of China ,
Industrial Bank, China Life and Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.,
have raised about $19.5 billion selling shares domestically since
January 2006. ICBC in December overtook  HSBC Holdings Plc (5)  as the
world's largest bank by market value.  
 As banks bolstered their finances through share sales and
doled out more loans, the People's Bank of China raised the so-
called reserve requirement ratio five times in the past eight
months, trying to limit funds available for lending.  
 The central bank on Feb. 16 boosted the ratio to 10 percent
from 9.5 percent. It will carry out at least one more increase
this year, according to 12 of 14 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News  last month.  
 Industrial Bank Co. and other lenders have boosted profits
to record levels as economic growth that averaged 10 percent over
the past four years drove demand for credit. They extended 3.18
trillion yuan ($411 billion) of loans in 2006, exceeding the
central bank's target of 2.5 trillion yuan.  
 ``Banks have to keep themselves quite liquid, not stretching
their loan portfolios, to avoid getting into trouble,'' said Kent Yau, a Hong Kong-based deputy head of research at Core Pacific-
Yamaichi International Ltd. ``The have to play a little
conservative.''  
 Shares of China Minsheng Banking Corp., the nation's only
non-state bank, dropped 10 percent, the most since October 2005,
to close at 11.37 yuan. The country's securities rules limit the
daily movement of a stock to 10 percent.  
 China Merchants Bank Co., the nation's sixth-largest, lost 9
percent to 15.34 yuan. Bank of China shares fell 7.2 percent to
4.62 yuan.
