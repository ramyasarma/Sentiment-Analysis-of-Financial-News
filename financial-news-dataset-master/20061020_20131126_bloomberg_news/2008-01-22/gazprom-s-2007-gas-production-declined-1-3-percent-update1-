             OAO Gazprom,  Russia 's state-controlled natural-gas export monopoly, pumped 548.5 billion
cubic meters of gas in 2007, 1.3 percent less than the previous
year, as milder weather reduced demand for the fuel.  
 Gazprom produced 556 billion cubic meters of gas in 2006,
the Moscow-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. It
raised reserves by more than 585 billion cubic meters, according
to preliminary data.  
 Gazprom, the world's biggest producer and exporter of
natural gas, supplies about a quarter of  Europe 's fuel needs.
The company has proven gas reserves in excess of 29 trillion
cubic meters, according to a statement on the company's Web
site.  
 Gazprom produced 555 billion cubic meters of gas and
increased its gas reserves by 583.4 billion cubic meters in
2005.
