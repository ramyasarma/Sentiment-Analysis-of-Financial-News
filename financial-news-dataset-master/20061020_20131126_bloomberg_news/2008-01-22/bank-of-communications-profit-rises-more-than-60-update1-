             Bank of Communications Ltd ., part-
owned by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , said profit gained more than 60
percent in 2007 on higher income from lending and more revenue
from fee-based services.  
 The company didn't disclose its net income for last year,
though said earnings were 12.55 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) in
2006, or 0.27 yuan per share, in a statement to the  Hong Kong 
Stock Exchange today.  
 Shanghai-based Bank of Communications, China's sixth
largest, joined rivals including Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. in reporting
surging profits as China's economic growth drives demand for
loans.  
 The company's shares dropped 13 percent in Hong Kong to
close at HK$7.89 as financial stocks fell in Asia on concern
that a possible U.S. economic recession may hurt demand for
loans and other financial services. The stock fell 8.7 percent
in Shanghai to 12.95  yuan .
