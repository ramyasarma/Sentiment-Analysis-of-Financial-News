             China's imports of crude slowed last
month after PetroChina Co. and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
boosted domestic production.  
 Crude imports rose 1.8 percent to 13.94 million tons in
January, the Customs General  Administration of China  said on its
 Web site  today. That compares with a 3.5 percent increase last
January and a 69 percent rise in January 2006. Exports fell 41
percent to 180,000 tons, it said.  
 State oil companies in China, the world's second-largest
energy user, boosted crude imports 12.4 percent last year to end
a nationwide fuel shortage after peak consumption in summer.
Emergency imports in the previous months cut the nation's need
for crude, Niu Li, an oil economist with the State Information
Center, said.  
 ``Domestic supply has been much improved, so state oil
companies may not immediately need to largely boost their
imports,'' Niu said by telephone from Beijing today.  
 China  increased domestic crude output by 1.6 percent to
186.7 million in 2007. The import of oil products rose 17 percent
to 3.23 million tons last month, the government said. Export
figures weren't provided.  
 China, which became a net importer of coal for the first
time last January, cut overseas purchases of the fuel by 10
percent to 4.24 million tons, customs figures show today.  
 Vietnam , China's largest coal supplier, plans to reduce
exports to China to 13 million tons this year from 16 million
tons in 2007 to meet rising domestic demand, an official at the
state-run Vietnam National Coal & Mineral Industries Group told
Bloomberg yesterday.  
 China's Guangdong Yudean Group Corp., suspended coal talks
with Vietnam after suppliers in the Southeast Asian nation
increased prices by 40 percent, China Business News reported Jan.
30. Yudean is the largest power supplier in  Guangdong province ,
the nation's manufacturing hub.
