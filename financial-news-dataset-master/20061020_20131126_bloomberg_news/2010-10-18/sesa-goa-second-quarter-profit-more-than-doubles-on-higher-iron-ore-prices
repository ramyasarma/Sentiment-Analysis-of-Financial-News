Sesa Goa Ltd. , India’s biggest iron-
ore exporter, said  second-quarter  profit more than doubled,
aided by higher prices of the steelmaking raw material.  Group  net income rose to 3.85 billion rupees ($87 million)
in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 1.66 billion rupees a
year earlier, the Panaji, Goa-based unit of  Vedanta Resources
Plc  said today in a statement. Total income climbed 70 percent
to 9.18 billion rupees.  Contract prices for so-called fines with 63 percent iron
ore content more than doubled in the July to September period to
about $150 a metric ton as demand picked up after the worst
recession since World War II. Prices also gained after top ore
suppliers  Vale SA ,  Rio Tinto Ltd.  and  BHP Billiton Ltd.  this
year abandoned a 40-year custom of setting prices annually in
favor of quarterly contracts.  Shares  of Sesa Goa fell 0.5 percent to 372.4 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close of trading in Mumbai. The benchmark Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange gained 0.2 percent.  Average cash prices  of 62 percent iron-content ore
delivered to Tianjin port in China rose 58 percent to $137 a
metric ton in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $87
a ton a year ago, according to data provider The Steel Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
