Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said China’s exchange-rate policy is unfair to trading
partners and the yuan is more undervalued than other emerging
market currencies.  “It’s significantly undervalued, more so than is true of
any major significant emerging-market currency,” Geithner said
in a panel discussion in Palo Alto, California. “It’s unfair to
all of China’s trading partners, Americans and others, because
it just creates a playing field that’s unbalanced” and gives
Chinese companies a “huge” short-term advantage, Geithner said.  Carbon Incentives  China’s incentives to encourage low-carbon generation such
as solar and wind power are almost triple those in the U.S.,
according to the Climate Institute.  Measures to spur renewable energy, as well as taxes on
dirtier forms of generation such as burning coal placed China
above the U.S., Japan, Australia and South Korea in a six-
country study and below only the U.K., according to the report,
prepared for the Sydney-based  institute  by London-based analysts
at Vivid Economics.  China, the biggest emitter, said last year it aims to cut
carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by
40 percent to 45 percent from 2005 through 2020, when its target
is to get 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources. The
U.S and other countries are losing out to China in developing
clean energy, Erwin Jackson, deputy chief executive officer of
the Australian institute, said in a telephone interview.  Capital-Flood Caution  Capital flooding into Asia could lead to excessive
exchange-rate moves, asset bubbles and financial instability,
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the head of the International Monetary
Fund, said in Shanghai.  Some flows “can clearly be destabilizing,” Strauss-Kahn
said in a speech distributed at a briefing after a conference
sponsored by the IMF and co-hosted by the Chinese central bank.  Emerging economies have complained about near-zero interest
rates in the U.S. leading to capital flooding their markets,
while U.S. and European policy makers have criticized Asian
governments for holding their currencies down to aid exports.
Strauss-Kahn didn’t refer to the yuan, while  John Lipsky , the
IMF’s No. 2 official, welcomed China’s decision in June to allow
more currency flexibility.  THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY:  China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co.  (601601 CH) said its
