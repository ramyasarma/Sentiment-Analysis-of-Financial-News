from the last close.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  rose for the first day
in three, gaining 111.06, or 0.4 percent, to 30,177.05 in
Johannesburg.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ): Gold’s advance may pause
after it failed to extend its rally at the end of last week and
developed a “shooting star” formation, an indication that

percent, to 324.92 rand.  Dorbyl Ltd.  (DLV SJ): The engineering company based in

lasting six weeks after winning a pay increase almost four times
the inflation rate, a labor union official said. The platinum
miner said the strike cost the company as much as 380 million
rand in lost revenue. Northam dropped 1 cent, or less than 0.1
percent, to 46.50 rand.  Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ): Crude oil rose for the first time in
three days as the dollar pared gains against the euro and as a
strike in France spread. Shares in Sasol, the world’s biggest

to 317.50 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
