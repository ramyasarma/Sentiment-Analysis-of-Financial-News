European stocks rose to the highest
level since April as Royal Bank of Canada’s offer for  BlueBay
Asset Management Plc  boosted financial-services companies,
outweighing losses in BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group.  BlueBay jumped 30 percent after agreeing to be bought by
RBC. Credit Suisse Group AG led gains by banks as Citigroup Inc.
reported earnings that topped estimates.  BHP Billiton  and Rio
Tinto slid after scrapping an iron-ore joint venture. Royal
Philips Electronics NV, the world’s largest lighting company,
sank 4.2 percent for the biggest drop in two months after saying
it’s “cautious” on fourth-quarter sales.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  advanced 0.3 percent to 266.64
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the highest level since April
26. The benchmark measure for European equities has climbed 2.7
percent this month amid speculation that the Federal Reserve
will announce further plans to stimulate economic growth at its
November meeting.  “We are getting good figures from U.S. banks but investors
are also waiting to see what will come from European banks,”
said  Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein , an equity strategist at Deutsche
Postbank AG in Bonn. “The strong M&A activity shows that
companies are rich in cash and willing to invest in the market.
Still we could see investors remain a bit in wait-and-see mode
until we get more earnings and more indications on the strength
of the economic recovery.”  U.S. Earnings  In the U.S., 12 members of the 30-stock  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  are scheduled to post earnings this week. Of
the 24  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  companies that have announced
results since Oct. 7, 75 percent have beaten analyst estimates
for per-share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 15 of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.7 percent
and Germany’s DAX rose 0.4 percent. France’s CAC 40 increased
0.2 percent.  BlueBay  rallied 30 percent to 487 pence after the London-
based manager of fixed-income funds agreed to be bought by RBC
for about 963 million pounds ($1.5 billion).  Rivals  Ashmore Group Plc , a U.K. fund manager that focuses
on emerging markets, and  Henderson Group Plc , which owns New
Star Asset Management Group Plc, climbed 1.5 percent to 381.6
pence and 4.7 percent to 137.6 pence, respectively. Man Group
Plc, the world’s largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager,
advanced 2.2 percent to 269.9 pence.  Banks Gain  Credit Suisse, the second-largest Swiss bank, led a measure
of lenders higher, rising 2.4 percent to 42.99 francs. Societe
Generale SA climbed 2 percent to 42.36 euros and Lloyds Banking
Group Plc gained 2.9 percent to 72.2 pence.  Citigroup , the bank 12 percent-owned by U.S. taxpayers,
today said third-quarter net income surged to $2.17 billion,
beating analysts’ projections as the company reduced loan-loss
reserves by $1.99 billion.  Euro-region interbank borrowing costs rose to the same
level as the European Central Bank’s main interest rate for the
first time in 15 months today, signaling greater willingness by
financial institutions to lend to one another. The increase in
Euribor suggests more banks are weaning themselves off ECB
liquidity programs that were started to fight the global
recession and then extended as the Greek debt crisis fueled
concern some nations in the region could default.  Nexans, Draka  Nexans SA climbed 2.3 percent to 54.36 euros as the world’s
biggest maker of cables started talks to buy Dutch rival  Draka
Holding NV  for about 731 million euros ($1 billion). Draka
shares added 1.7 percent to 15.57 euros.  Negotiations will focus on a recommended cash offer of 15
euros a share, Paris-based Nexans said today. Flint Beheer NV,
Draka’s main shareholder with 48.5 percent, has pledged its
stake, subject to conditions, it said.  Air France-KLM Group rose 3.9 percent to 12.66 euros, the
highest price since April, as France’s largest airline was
raised to “buy” from “hold” at Citigroup.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG  surged 4.5 percent to 17.84 francs
as Helvea AG recommended buying shares of the world’s biggest
maker of dental implants.  Bellway Plc, a U.K. homebuilder specializing in first-time
buyers, increased 2.6 percent to 601.5 pence, while  Persimmon
Plc , the U.K.’s third-largest homebuilder by volume, climbed 2
percent to 386.2 pence. Taylor Wimpey Plc rallied 2 percent to
26.11 pence.  London home sellers raised asking prices by the most in six
months in October as owners across the U.K. brushed off the
challenges posed by the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War
II, Rightmove Plc said.  BHP, Rio  BHP Billiton slipped 0.6 percent to 2,185.5 pence and Rio
Tinto retreated 1.5 percent to 4,080 pence, dragging a measure
of basic-resources producers to the biggest drop among 19
 industry groups  in the Stoxx 600.  The world’s No. 1 and No. 3 mining companies abandoned a
plan to create the largest iron-ore exporter after regulators
from Europe to Asia were concerned it would limit competition.
The changes demanded by regulators, including asset sales, were
unacceptable to both companies, London-based Rio said.  Antofagasta Plc dropped 1.5 percent to 1,288 pence as HSBC
Holdings Plc cut its recommendation on the mining company to
“underweight” from “neutral.” Rival  Vedanta Resources Plc 
lost 1.5 percent to 2,253 pence as the brokerage cut its stance
to “neutral” from “overweight.”  Philips slid 4.2 percent to 22.88 euros, the biggest drop
since Aug. 11, after saying it’s “cautious” on sales for the
year’s final three months because of the economic climate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
