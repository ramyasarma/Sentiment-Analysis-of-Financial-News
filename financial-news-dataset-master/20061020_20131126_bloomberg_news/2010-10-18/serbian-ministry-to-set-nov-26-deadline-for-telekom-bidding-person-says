The Serbian government will set a
deadline of Nov. 26 for phone companies to place their bids for
a stake in Telekom Srbija AD, a government official said.  The tender for 51 percent of the dominant phone company
will be called on Oct. 20, said the official, who declined to be
identified because the sale date has not been announced
publicly.  The largest Serbian government-asset sale on record may be
completed by the first quarter of 2011, Deputy Prime Minister
 Bozidar Djelic  said on Sept. 17. The government is seeking at
least 1.4 billion euros ($1.94 billion), three other people with
knowledge of the matter said on Oct. 12. Telekom Austria AG,
Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom SA may be interested,
they said.  To qualify, potential bidders need to have five years in
the telecommunications business, 20 million landline and mobile-
phone users and 3 billion euros in market capitalization, the
government official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
