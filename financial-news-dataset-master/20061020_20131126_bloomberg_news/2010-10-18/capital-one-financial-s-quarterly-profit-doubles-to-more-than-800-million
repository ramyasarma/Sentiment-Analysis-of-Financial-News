Capital One Financial Corp. , the
most profitable U.S. credit-card issuer last year, jumped in
extended  trading  after third-quarter results exceeded analyst
estimates.  Net income climbed to $803 million, or $1.76 a share, from
$394 million, or 87 cents, in the year-earlier period, the
McLean, Virginia-based company said in a statement distributed
by PR Newswire today. The average estimate of 22  analysts  was
$1.20.  The lender advanced 5.5 percent to $39.28 at 5:59 p.m. New
York time. Results were bolstered by the release of $624 million
from an account to cover future loan losses as write-offs on
U.S. credit cards declined.  “Continued improvement in credit loss and delinquency
performance in the portfolio was the primary driver of the third
quarter allowance release,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
