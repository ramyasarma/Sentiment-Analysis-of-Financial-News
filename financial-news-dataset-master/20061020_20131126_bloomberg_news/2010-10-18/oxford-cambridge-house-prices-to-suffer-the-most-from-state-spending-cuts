House prices in  Oxford  and Cambridge
may suffer more from government spending cuts than anywhere else
in England and Wales because of the university towns’ high
proportion of public-sector workers.  About 46 percent of workers in Oxford are employed by the
state, the most among all municipalities, according to a survey
published today by property website  Zoopla.co.uk.  Average house
prices have already fallen almost 4 percent in Oxford in the
past three years.  The area least likely to be hurt by the cuts is the City of
London, the capital’s main financial district, where 4 percent
of workers are in the public sector.  In Cambridge, the proportion is 43 percent. Public-sector
employees account for 40 percent or more of the workforce in
nine municipalities in England and Wales.  The government’s comprehensive spending review, intended to
slash most ministerial budgets by a quarter to reduce the
deficit, will be presented to parliament on Oct. 20. The
measures will probably lead to job losses and homeowners
struggling to pay mortgages, Zoopla said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
