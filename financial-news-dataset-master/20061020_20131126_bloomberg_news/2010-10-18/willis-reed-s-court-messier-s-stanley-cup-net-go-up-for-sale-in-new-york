Pieces of the court from the New
York Knicks’ championships seasons and goal netting from the New
York Rangers’ 1994 Stanley Cup run are for sale by a partnership
launched today by Madison Square Garden and Steiner Sports
Collectibles.  MSG-Steiner Collectibles will offer items from the current
arena’s 42-year history,  available on-line  and at the Midtown
Manhattan venue.  “We want fans to be able to buy things that bring them
closer to these famous championships and moments,” Steiner
chairman  Brandon Steiner  said in a telephone interview. “Be it
 Mark Messier ’s famous Game 6 or  Allan Houston ’s shot, it’s about
capturing the spirit, not only of the Garden but of the teams.”  A piece of court from the Knicks’ 1970 National Basketball
Association championship season is selling on the Steiner
 website for $199.00 . A piece autographed by members of the team
-- including  Bill Bradley ,  Willis Reed ,  Walt Frazier  and  Dave DeBusschere  -- is  going for $799.00 . The Knicks also won the
title in 1973.  The company hasn’t yet settled on pricing for the Rangers’
goal netting or glass from the hockey-rink boards, Steiner said.  The partnership also will sponsor player meet-and-greets
celebrating the championships and famous moments, Steiner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
