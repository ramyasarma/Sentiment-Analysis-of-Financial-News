Alberta’s provincial money manager
is in discussions with pension funds to take an equity
investment in  Potash Corp.  of Saskatchewan Inc. to block a
takeover by BHP Billiton Ltd., the Globe and Mail reported.  Alberta Investment Management Co. is proposing the plan to
take a 30 percent stake and agree to devote the output of one of
the largest potash mines to China, the  newspaper  said today,
citing unidentified people.  The plan would satisfy China’s demand for long-term potash
supplies as well as concerns of nationalists and the
Saskatchewan government about a foreign takeover of Potash
Corp., the Globe said. The plan was given a low chance of
success by one of the people, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
