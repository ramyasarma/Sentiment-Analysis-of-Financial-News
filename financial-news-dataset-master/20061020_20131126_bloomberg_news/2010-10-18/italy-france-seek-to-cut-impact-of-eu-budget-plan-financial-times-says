Italy, supported by France and
Belgium, appears to have made headway with a campaign to
ameliorate the potential impact of plans to reform the
eurozone’s budget rules, the Financial Times reported, citing
diplomats and policy makers.  The European Commission announced last month a package of
proposals aimed at preventing the build-up of excessive amounts
of sovereign debt; the shape of the final draft legislation is
likely to become apparent today at the final meeting of an
economic governance group chaired by  Herman Van Rompuy , the
president of the European Council, the newspaper said.  The FT said it hadn’t succeeded in ascertaining the extent
to which Italy and its backers have succeeded in shifting the
discussion away from the rigid measures initially proposed, the
FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
