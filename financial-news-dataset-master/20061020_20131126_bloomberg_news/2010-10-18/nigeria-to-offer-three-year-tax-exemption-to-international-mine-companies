Nigeria has put in place “numerous
incentives” to attract foreign investors to the country’s
mining industry, Mines Minister Musa Sada said.  “Government will offer a three-year tax holiday to to new
companies, reduce the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 10
percent, and companies profit tax  from 35 percent to 30
percent,” Sada told reporters in the capital, Abuja, today.  The West African nation’s government will also provide
“mining-specific” support mechanisms and facilities to help
enhance the development of mines and ensure movement of raw
materials and products from the inward mining locations, Sada
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
