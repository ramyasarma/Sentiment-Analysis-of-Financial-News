Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-largest bank by assets, will offer the first
Visa Inc. branded debit card in Canada.  The CIBC Advantage Card will be available to clients
starting today, the Toronto-based lender said in a statement.  The card allows customers to make debit-card purchases
outside North America or online anywhere that Visa Debit is
accepted. Previously, they were only able to do so through the
Interac Association network, a group of banks, credit unions and
merchants that controls the country’s payment network.  In April, Canada’s finance ministry approved a voluntary
code of conduct for the country’s debit and credit card network
that was adopted by Visa, Interac and other payment networks.  Visa, based in San Francisco, is the world’s biggest
payments network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
