(Corrects Michigan State’s record in seventh paragraph.)  Oklahoma and Oregon claimed the top
two spots in the season’s first Bowl Championship Series
rankings, with Boise State third at the start of the two-month
race for a berth in college football’s national title game.  The University of Oklahoma improved to 6-0 with a 52-0 rout
of Iowa State two days ago. The  Sooners , who won the BCS
championship after the 2000 season and lost the title game
following the 2003, 2004 and 2008 campaigns, have a rating of
.922 out of 1.000 in the standings.  The University of Oregon is second at .892, followed by
Boise State at .890. Both schools have 6-0 records this season
and Boise State has won 20 straight games overall, the nation’s
longest winning streak.  The teams that finish the regular season at No. 1 and No. 2
in the BCS standings will play for the national championship on
Jan. 10 in Glendale, Arizona. The BCS is determined using the
USA Today coaches’ poll, the Harris Interactive poll and six
computer rankings.  The final standings will be released Dec. 5.  While  Oregon  was ranked No. 1 by both national polls used
by the BCS formula, the Ducks averaged eighth in the computer
rankings. Boise State, second in the coaches’ poll and the
Harris poll, was ranked seventh by the computers. Oklahoma had
the highest average computer rating and was ranked third by the
coaches and fourth in the Harris poll.  Auburn University (7-0) is fourth in the BCS standings,
followed by Texas Christian University (7-0), Louisiana State
University (7-0) and Michigan State (7-0).  The University of Alabama (6-1) -- the defending national
champion -- is the highest-ranked one-loss team at eighth.  The University of Utah (6-0) and Ohio State (6-1) complete
the top 10 schools in the initial BCS standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
