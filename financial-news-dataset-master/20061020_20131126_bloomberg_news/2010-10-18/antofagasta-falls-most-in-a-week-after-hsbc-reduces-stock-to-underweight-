Antofagasta Plc, the copper producer
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, dropped as much as 3.1
percent in London trading, the biggest intraday decline since
Oct. 7, after HSBC Holdings Plc downgraded the stock.  The shares traded down 2.7 percent at 1,272 pence as of
8:45 a.m. local time. HSBC reduced the stock to “underweight”
from “neutral” in a note to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
