Japanese government  bonds  declined
amid speculation investors are selling the securities before an
auction of 20-year bonds this week.  Bond futures slumped the most in almost two weeks as
domestic stocks advanced. Primary dealers, which are required to
bid at government debt sales, often reduce holdings of bonds in
case prices decline before they can pass on the new securities
to investors. The  Ministry of Finance  will sell 1.1 trillion yen
($13.5 billion) of 20-year debt on Oct. 21.  “The slump in the bond market seems to be caused by
investors adjusting their positions before the auction of 20-
year bonds,”  RuiXue Xu , a strategist at RBS Securities
Japan Ltd., said today.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond increased 1.5 basis
points to 0.885 percent as of 3:12 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
0.8 percent security due September 2020 fell 0.136 yen to 99.225
yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery dropped 0.19 to
143.69 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the most
since Oct. 7. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.4 percent.  The difference in  yield  between 20-year bonds and five-year
notes climbed to a three-week high on Oct. 14 after the Bank of
Japan pledged to keep its benchmark interest rate at “virtually
zero” on Oct. 5 until the end of deflation.  A sale today of five-year government securities drew bids
for 3.43 times the amount on offer, compared with 2.79 times
last month.  Takafumi Yamawaki , chief rates strategist at JPMorgan Chase
& Co. in Tokyo, recommended investors use a so-called barbell
strategy, favoring two- and 10-year bonds while shunning midterm
securities. That strategy will deliver a higher return than a
portfolio concentrated in five-year notes, he wrote in a report
today.  Meiji Investment  Declines in bonds were limited before a  U.S. report  today
that economists said will show housing starts dropped in
September for the first time in three months.  “With 10-year yields at around 0.9 percent, there are
investors willing to buy,” said RBS’s Xu. “Yields on short-and
medium-term bonds are at these lows, and super-long bonds are
volatile. So, 10-year bonds are easier to buy.”  Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. said today it plans to
boost its yen-denominated bond holdings by 400 billion yen and
reduce investment in the nation’s stocks in the second half of
this fiscal year.  Yields on 10-year Japanese debt will be at 1 percent by the
end of March, Japan’s third-largest life insurer estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
