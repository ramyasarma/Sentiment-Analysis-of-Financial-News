Gold declined for a second day,
after reaching a record last week, as a strengthening dollar
eased demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  Bullion for immediate delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
$1,361.32 an ounce at 2:05 p.m. Seoul time. The metal reached a
record $1,387.35 on Oct. 14 as the dollar fell on speculation
the Federal Reserve will take more stimulus measures amid low
inflation and an unemployment rate near 10 percent.  “For the time being we are just waiting for more
significant data and further rhetoric from the Fed,”  Darren Heathcote , head of trading at Investec Bank (Australia) Ltd.,
said today by phone from Sydney. “Gold is off the peak, but you
are bound to get some profit-taking,” he said.  Builders in the U.S. probably started fewer homes in
September, while production rose for a seventh month, signaling
growth may be uneven, economists said before reports this week.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Oct. 15 that the bank may
expand asset purchases, while saying “nonconventional
policies” have costs and limitations.  December-delivery gold on the Comex in New York fell 0.7
percent to $1,362.10 an ounce. Futures have advanced 24 percent
this year and reached a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  The dollar  rose  0.4 percent against a basket of six
currencies, gaining for a second day. The greenback traded at
$1.3893 per euro from $1.3977 on Oct. 15, when it earlier
reached the weakest level since January. Bullion typically moves
in the opposite direction to the U.S. currency.  Net-Long Positions  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in New York gold futures in the week
ended Oct. 12, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Speculative long positions, or bets prices will
rise, outnumbered short positions by 255,874 contracts on the
Comex. Net-long positions fell by 3,746 contracts, or 1 percent,
from a week earlier.  China is forecast to produce 340 metric tons of gold this
year, increasing from 2009, Zhang Fengkui, section chief of the
raw materials department at the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology, said on Oct. 16 at a conference, without
providing the scale of the increase. China’s gold output last
year reached 314 tons, the China Gold Association said in
January.  Silver fell 1.5 percent to $23.9675 an ounce at 2:09 p.m.
Seoul time after reaching $24.92 on Oct. 14, the highest level
for 30 years.  The metal may trade between $20.50 and $25.50 for the
remainder of the year,  Philip Klapwijk  chairman of London-based
research company GFMS Ltd., said Oct. 16.  “Our view is silver is likely nearing a top now, and that
it has more downside in the short term than upside, he said.
“But we remain bullish in the long term.”  Platinum fell 0.6 percent to $1,685.25 an ounce, while
palladium declined 1.7 percent to $579.50 an ounce after
reaching a nine-year high of $605.13 last week.  U.S. housing starts data will be released by the Commerce
Department tomorrow. A Federal Reserve report is forecast to

increased 0.2 percent for a second month, according to
