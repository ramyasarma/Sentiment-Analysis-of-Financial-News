Tea industry workers in  Kenya , the
world’s biggest exporter of black tea, began a strike to demand
that companies minimize the use of picking machines, the Central
Organization of Trade Unions said.  The work stoppage went ahead even after employers gained a
court order blocking the strike, Adam Baraza, personal assistant
to the labor union’s secretary-general, Francis Atwoli, said in
a phone interview today from Nairobi, the capital.  “COTU fights for workers rights and therefore the strike
continues until the issue is addressed,” Baraza said.  The strike involves an estimated 50,000 manual laborers in
tea plantations in the western Rift Valley and is aimed at
protecting the livelihoods of thousands of Kenyan families who
will be affected if machines continue to be used, Baraza said.  Agriculture accounts for a quarter of gross domestic
product in Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy. Tea production
may increase by 11 percent to 350 million kilograms (770 million
pounds) this year, the Kenya Tea Board said last month.  No one was available to comment when Bloomberg called the
offices of the Kenya Tea Growers Association, the main industry
body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
