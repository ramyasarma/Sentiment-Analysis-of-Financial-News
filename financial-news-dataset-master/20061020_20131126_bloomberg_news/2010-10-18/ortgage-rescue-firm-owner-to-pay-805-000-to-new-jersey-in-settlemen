The owner of several New Jersey
loan-modification companies agreed to pay $805,000 to resolve
civil allegations that he defrauded homeowners trying to avoid
foreclosure, the state’s attorney general said.  Stephen Pasch of Greenbrook Township settled claims that
his New Day Financial Solutions Inc. collected upfront fees from
homeowners after promising them help on mortgage modifications,
a practice banned by state law, Attorney General  Paul Dow  said
today in a statement. Lawyer Ejike Uzor of Newark, New Jersey,
and two of his companies also agreed to pay $25,000 to resolve
the case.  “These companies exploited people who looked to them for
hope and paid them for help,” Dow said in the statement. “This
type of activity is reprehensible anytime, but particularly
during tough economic times.”  Both men agreed to a permanent ban on soliciting consumers
for any business related to loan modification, debt adjustment
or credit repair, according to Dow. Pasch agreed to a 10-year
ban on applying for a banking license from the state.  Pasch’s other companies include American Credit Repair &
Settlement, NDROA Inc. and Paramount Debt Settlement USA. The
Uzor companies were Uzor Financial Solutions and Ejike N. Uzor &
Associates. The men also fraudulently used a purported non-
profit known as American Financial Advocacy Council, Dow said.  A state Superior Court judge signed a consent judgment for
Uzor on Sept. 29 and for Pasch on Sept. 7, according to
documents released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
