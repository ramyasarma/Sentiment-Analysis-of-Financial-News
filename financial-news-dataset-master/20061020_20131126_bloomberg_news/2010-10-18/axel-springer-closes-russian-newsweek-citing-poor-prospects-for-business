Axel Springer AG, Europe’s largest
publisher of newspapers, said it will shut its Russian Newsweek
magazine “with respect to economic reasons.”  The journal’s Oct. 18 issue will be the last, Axel Springer
said in a statement today.  “We have failed to bring the magazine to a firm economic
base and we could not create a prosperous perspective,” Axel
Springer International President Ralph Buechi said in the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
