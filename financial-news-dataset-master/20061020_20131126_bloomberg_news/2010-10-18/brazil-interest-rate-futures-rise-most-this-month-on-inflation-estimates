The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts gained the most this month as traders bet on
higher borrowing costs after economists raised their 2010
inflation forecast for a fifth straight week.  The yield on the contract due in January 2012 rose 5 basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 11.27 percent at 11:31 a.m.
New York time.  “The monetary policy committee should keep the Selic rate
steady at this week’s monetary policy committee meeting, and the
rest of the year, but high inflation would require a rise in
interest rates in 2011,” said  Andre Perfeito , an economist at
Gradual Investimentos, in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  Consumer price inflation will quicken to 5.20 percent in
2010, compared with a week-earlier forecast of 5.15 percent,
according to the median forecast in an Oct. 15 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today. Consumer prices
will rise 4.99 percent in 2011, from a week-earlier forecast of
4.98 percent, the survey found.  The real erased earlier losses and increased 0.1 percent to
1.6630 per dollar, from 1.6651 on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
