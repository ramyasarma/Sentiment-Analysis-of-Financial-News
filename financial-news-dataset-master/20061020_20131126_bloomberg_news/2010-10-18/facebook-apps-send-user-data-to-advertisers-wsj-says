Facebook Inc.’s top 10 applications
have been transmitting data that can be utilized to identify
users to advertising and Internet-tracking firms, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing its own investigation.  The applications, known as apps, have been providing users’
“Facebook ID” numbers, which can be used to obtain such
information as people’s names, to the third-party companies,  the
newspaper said  today. The apps include Zynga Game Network Inc.’s
FarmVille, Texas HoldEm Poker and FrontierVille, it said.  Passing on the information, which affects tens of millions
of app users, including people who set their profiles to the
site’s strictest privacy settings, breaks Facebook’s rules and
renews questions about its ability to keep personal information
secure, the Journal said.  Facebook is planning to introduce new systems that will
“dramatically” limit the sharing of user IDs, the company said
in an e-mailed statement, without elaborating. There is no
evidence that personal information was misused or collected,
said the Palo Alto, California-based Facebook, which has more
than 500 million users.  Facebook may have shut down some applications that the
Journal found were transmitting user IDs, the Journal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
