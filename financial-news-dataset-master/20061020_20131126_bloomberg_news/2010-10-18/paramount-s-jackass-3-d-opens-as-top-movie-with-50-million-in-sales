(Corrects to say ‘Social Network’ is Sony Corp. film in
eighth paragraph.)  The stunt movie “Jackass 3-D”
opened as the top movie at theaters in the U.S. and Canada,
taking in $50 million for distributor Paramount Pictures.  The spy spoof “Red,” also in its debut, was second with
an estimated $22.5 million, researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office
said yesterday.  “Jackass 3-D” is the third film based on the MTV reality
television series. The first two, released in 2002 and 2006,
generated $164 million worldwide for Paramount, a unit of  Viacom
Inc.  The studio’s last No. 1 release was “Shrek Forever
After,” distributed for DreamWorks Animation SKG in May.  “This debut is far more than what Paramount expected,
especially because this stunts film is in its third
incarnation,” said  Jeff Bock , box-office analyst for Los
Angeles-based researcher Exhibitor Relations Co. “It succeeded
because it was shot in 3-D and that’s what people have been
waiting for since Avatar.”  “Avatar,” from News Corp.’s Fox, is the top-grossing film
this year, with $466 million in ticket sales.  James Cameron ’s 3-
D movie is the highest-grossing film of all time.  “Jackass 3-D” stars  Johnny Knoxville  and is directed by
Jeff Tremaine. The film follows the cast as they perform
outrageous and potentially dangerous stunts.  Graphic Novel  “Red,” based on a graphic novel, stars  Bruce Willis  as a
recently retired spy who must find out who is trying to kill
him. He enlists the aid of other former agents, played by  Helen Mirren ,  Morgan Freeman  and  John Malkovich , in getting to the
truth. The film is being distributed by Summit Entertainment
LLC.  “The Social Network,” Sony Corp.’s drama about the
founding of Facebook Inc., dropped to third from first with $11
million. The film, starring Jesse Eisenberg as Facebook co-
founder  Mark Zuckerberg , has taken in $63.1 million since its
Oct. 1 release.  “Secretariat,” about the 1973 Triple Crown-winning
thoroughbred racehorse, fell to fourth place with $9.5 million
after opening last week in third place. The movie stars  Diane Lane  as Penny Chenery, the housewife who took over the stable
where the horse was trained. John Malkovich co-stars.  “Life as We Know It,” from Time Warner Inc.’s Warner
Bros., was fifth with $9.2 million. The movie stars  Katherine Heigl  and Josh Duhamel as two young adults who are asked to take
custody of their infant goddaughter after the child’s parents
are killed.  Weekend sales for the top 12 films fell 5 percent to $121
million from $128 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said.
Year-to-date receipts total $8.48 billion, up 3.2 percent from
$8.22 billion. Attendance has fallen 2.3 percent this year.  The following table has figures provided by studios to Los
