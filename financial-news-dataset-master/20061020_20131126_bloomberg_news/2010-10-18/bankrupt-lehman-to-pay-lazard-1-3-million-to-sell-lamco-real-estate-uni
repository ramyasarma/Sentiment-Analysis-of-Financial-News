Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  said
it would pay adviser Lazard Ltd. $1.3 million to sell its Lamco
asset management unit, plus a monthly fee of $150,000.  Bankrupt Lehman hired Lazard for $400,000 a month in 2008
to help with asset sales, undertaking to pay $5 million when
Lazard sold Lehman’s brokerage to Barclays Plc, and another $5
million when the defunct firm’s investment-management division
was sold, according to an Oct. 15 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York. Lazard currently gets $200,000 a month from
Lehman, the filing showed.  Lamco, staffed by 450 employees who manage the defunct
investment bank’s “less-liquid and distressed” real estate,
private equity and other assets, “may be of substantial value”
to Lehman’s creditors, Lehman said in the filing.  Lehman said last month it aimed to recover $11.4 billion
from illiquid real estate in the next few years, with private
equity and principal investments bringing in the same amount.
Loans and derivates were valued at about $10 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
