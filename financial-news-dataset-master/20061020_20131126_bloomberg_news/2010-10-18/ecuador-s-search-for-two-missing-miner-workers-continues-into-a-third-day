Rescue workers in Ecuador are
searching for two miners trapped three days ago in a gold mine
cave-in that killed two other workers in the southern city of
Portovelo, the government said.  The rescue has been slowed because of wooden support beams
mixed with rubble trapping the miners, according to a statement
published today on the Ecuadorean president’s  website . The
missing miners may be on the sixth floor of the mine, 180 meters
(590 feet) below ground, the country’s Non-Renewable Natural
Resources Ministry said last night in an e-mailed statement.  “We still have hope the remaining men are alive,” Carlos
Pareja Yannuzzelli, vice minister of oil, said last night in an
e-mailed statement.  Two miners were found dead on Oct. 16 after officials began
removing 200 metric tons of rock from a gold, silver, and copper
mine. The accident came two days after the rescue of 33 Chilean
miners, trapped below ground for 70 days in what became the
world’s longest mine rescue, which was watched around the globe.  The mine in Ecuador, owned by Machala, Ecuador-based
 Minesadco SA , collapsed after a water leak eroded support
structures where the miners were working.  Walter Vera, 31, and Paul Aguirre, 21, were found dead
underneath rubble from the cave-in Oct 16. Vera’s brother Angel,
and Pedro Mendoza are still missing, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
