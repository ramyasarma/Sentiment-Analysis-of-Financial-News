Japan Airlines Corp.’s four biggest
lenders agreed to provide 300 billion yen ($3.7 billion) in
additional loans, the Asahi newspaper reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.   Japan Airlines, which is restructuring under bankruptcy
protection, will use the money to pay back its existing debt.
That will allow the company to finish the restructuring process
by the end of this fiscal year.  The four banks are Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.,
and the state-run Development Bank of Japan. The company plans
to list shares by the end of 2012, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
