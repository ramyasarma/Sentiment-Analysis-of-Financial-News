Oil rose from its lowest level in a
week in New York as rebounding equity markets spurred bets that
earlier losses were not justified.  Futures recovered from a 1.1 percent decline as the dollar
pared some of its gains versus the euro, enhancing the appeal of
using commodities to protect against inflation. Last week the
dollar dropped as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
signaled more so-called quantitative easing is likely.  “Firmer equities and persistent weakness in the U.S.
currency have been supportive, with the broader market holding
firm on high hopes for a much-anticipated liquidity boost from
the Fed,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov  at VTB Capital in London.  Crude for November delivery traded for $81.47 a barrel, 22
cent higher, at 1:45 p.m. London time after dropping as much as
90 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $80.35 a barrel in electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That’s the lowest
since Oct. 8. Brent crude for December settlement was up 32
cents at $82.77 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London,
after falling as low as $81.53.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.3 percent to 266.5 at
1:45 p.m. in London, reversing an earlier decline of 0.5
percent, and U.S. stock-index futures narrowed declines after
Citigroup Inc. reported earnings that exceeded analysts’
estimates. December contracts on the S&P 500 were down 0.2
percent, paring a drop of as much as 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
