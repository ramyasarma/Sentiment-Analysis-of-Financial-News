Japan may lose about 60 trillion yen
($739 billion) in domestic demand and 3 million jobs over the
next five years as manufacturers shift production abroad, the
Yomiuri newspaper said, citing research by the Keidanren
business lobby.  The Keidanren wants the government to implement policies to
promote capital investment, the report said. The government
should also intervene in the currency market to stop the yen’s
appreciation, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
