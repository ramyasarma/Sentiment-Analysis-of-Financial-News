Gold futures rose after the dollar
resumed its decline, boosting demand for the precious metal as
an alternative investment.  The greenback gained as much as 0.8 percent against a
basket of major currencies before erasing gains. On Oct. 14,
gold reached a record $1,388.10 an ounce as the dollar headed to
the lowest level since January after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said additional monetary stimulus may be
warranted.  “Gold is following the dollar tick for tick,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “Investors
really haven’t given up on gold yet.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 10 cents to settle
at $1,372.10 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the precious metal fell as much as 1.4 percent,
mirroring fluctuations in the dollar.  Assets  in exchange-traded products backed by gold declined
1.99 metric tons to 2,102.65 tons on Oct. 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings are up 17
percent this year and reached a record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.  ‘No Demand’  “There’s no demand for physical gold at these prices,”
said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset
Management in Evanston, Illinois. “Only the investors are
buying.”  Gold has climbed 25 percent this year, heading for a 10th
straight annual gain. The metal has outperformed global
equities, Treasuries and most industrial metals.  Central banks probably will add to their gold reserves for
the next several years, said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and
the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 12.5 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $24.413 an ounce. On Oct. 14, the price reached
$24.95, the highest level since March 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $2.90, or 0.2
percent, to $1,698.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery dropped $1.10, or
0.2 percent, to $588.10 an ounce. On Oct. 7, the metal reached
$606.25, the highest price since June 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
