South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  rose for the first day in three, gaining 111.06, or
0.4 percent, to 30,177.05 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo Platinum Ltd.  (AMS SJ), the world’s largest producer
of the metal, dropped for a second day, retreating 4.08 rand, or
0.6 percent, to 695.01 rand. The price of platinum declined,
losing $2.75, or 0.2 percent, to $1,693.5 an ounce.  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd.  (APN SJ), the southern
hemisphere’s largest maker of generic medicine, added 1.20 rand,
or 1.4 percent, to 90.20 rand. Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
extended its exclusivity pact with Aspen to Oct. 29, according
to a regulatory filing.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, fell 50 cents, or 0.2 percent, to 238 rand, a second
day of decreases. It has abandoned plans for a joint venture
with Rio Tinto Group that would have created the largest iron-
ore exporter after antitrust regulators placed conditions on the
partnership such as asset sales that were not acceptable to the
companies.  Harmony Gold Mining Ltd.  (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest
producer of the metal, climbed 70 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
77.50 rand. The company said it will close its Merriespruit No.
1 shaft at its Virginia operations because the ore body is mined
out and the costs are “no longer viable.”  Mustek Ltd.  (MST SJ), a computer-services company, lost the
most in two weeks, dropping 27 cents, or 7 percent, to 3.61
rand. The company rejected  Datatec Ltd.’s  offer to buy its stake
in a jointly held unit, Comztek Ltd. Datatec gained 88 cents, or
2.5 percent, to 35.89 rand.  Old Mutual Plc  (OML SJ), Africa’s largest insurer, added 12
cents, or 0.8 percent.  Nedbank Group Ltd. , the South African
bank controlled by Old Mutual, said earnings excluding one-time
items for the year to December may rise as much as 14 percent
compared with a year earlier.  SABMiller Plc , (SAB SJ), the world’s second-biggest brewer
by volume, rose 1.45 rand, or 0.6 percent, to 226.95 rand. The
company said sales in the six months to September grew as gains
in Asia and Africa offset declines in Latin America and Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
