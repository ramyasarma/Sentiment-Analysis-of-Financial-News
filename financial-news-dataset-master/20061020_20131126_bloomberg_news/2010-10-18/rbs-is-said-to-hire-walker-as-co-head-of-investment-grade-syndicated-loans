Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  has
hired UBS AG’s  Simon Walker  as co-head of syndicated loans
focused on investment-grade borrowings, according to a person
familiar with the hire.  Walker, who started last week, is based in Stamford,
Connecticut, and reports to  Victor Forte , head of syndicate
loans for the Americas, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. He is co-head with
 David Nadelman , head of loan syndicate, Americas for non-
investment grade clients, the person said.  Since the end of August, RBS has served as a joint lead
arranger on 10 U.S. dollar investment-grade deals for $18
billion, according to RBS data. These financings include a $1
billion unsecured revolving line of credit for  Discovery
Communications Inc.  and a $1.75 billion revolver for  Weatherford
International Ltd.   Walker was most recently head of investment-grade loan
markets at UBS. Before that he spent 12 years at Citigroup Inc.
in both the U.S. and Europe working in global portfolio
management, debt capital markets and structured derivatives, the
person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
