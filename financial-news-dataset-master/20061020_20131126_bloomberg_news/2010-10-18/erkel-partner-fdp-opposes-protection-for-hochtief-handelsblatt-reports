Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government won’t change the law to protect German construction
company  Hochtief AG  from a takeover by Spain’s  Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA ,  Christian Lindner , general
secretary of the Free Democratic Party, told  Handelsblatt .  “There won’t be a Hochtief law,” Lindner, whose pro-
market FDP is the junior partner in the government, told the
newspaper. Competition in the construction industry wouldn’t be
hindered by the takeover, he said.  Essen, Germany-based Hochtief is the country’s biggest
construction company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
