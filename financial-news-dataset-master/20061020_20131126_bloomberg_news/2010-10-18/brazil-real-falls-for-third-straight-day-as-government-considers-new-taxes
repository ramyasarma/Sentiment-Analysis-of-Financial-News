Brazil’s real declined for a third
straight day after central bank President  Henrique Meirelles 
said the government is considering additional tax measures that
could impact the currency’s exchange rate.  The real decreased 0.2 percent to 1.6691 per dollar at 8:56
a.m. New York time, from 1.6651 on Oct. 15.  The real has gained 1.7 percent since Brazil doubled its
foreign inflow tax on fixed-income investments to 4 percent on
Oct. 4 in an effort to stem the currency’s appreciation.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
11.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
