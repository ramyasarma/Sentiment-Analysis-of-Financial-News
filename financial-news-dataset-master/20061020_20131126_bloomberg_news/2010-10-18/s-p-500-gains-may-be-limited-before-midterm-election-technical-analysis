The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
struggle to climb higher before the U.S. midterm elections next
month, according to a technical analyst at Raymond James &
Associates Inc.  A resistance level for the benchmark gauge between 1,184
and 1,220 “looms large” following the completion of a so-
called inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, Chief Market
Technician  Arthur Huprich  wrote in a report today. The S&P 500
climbed 0.4 percent to 1,180.46 at 11:03 a.m. in New York.  “Ramping up trading stop-loss points between here and the
November election seems to make tactical sense,” Huprich, who
is based in St. Petersburg, Florida, wrote.  The S&P 500 has rallied to the highest level since May
after last week advancing 1 percent as Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said more stimulus may be needed to protect the
economic recovery and better-than-estimated earnings boosted
investor confidence.  Technical analysts make predictions based on price and
volume chart patterns. An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern
occurs when an index forms three consecutive troughs, with the
middle being the deepest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
