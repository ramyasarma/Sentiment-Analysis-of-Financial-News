Downer EDI Ltd. , an Australian
engineering company, is meeting with lenders in Asia this week
as it seeks more banks to help provide A$400 million ($397
million) of loans, two people familiar with the matter said.  The company is seeking to pay 260 basis points more than
the bank bill swap rate for 3-year debt and a 280 basis-point
margin for loans maturing in four years, the people said, asking
not to be named as the talks are private.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and National Australia
Bank Ltd. are arranging the loans, which will be used to
refinance existing debt, the people said. Commitments from banks
are due in the second week of November, one person said.  Downer, based in Sydney, has A$390 million of revolving
loans maturing in June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  In a revolving facility, money that’s been repaid can be
borrowed again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
