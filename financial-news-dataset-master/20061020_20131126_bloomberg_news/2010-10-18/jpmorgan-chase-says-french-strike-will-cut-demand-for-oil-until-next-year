JPMorgan Chase & Co. said strikes
that have halted refineries acrosss France will cut oil demand
until next year.  “Beyond any surge in demand as consumers seek to stock up
where possible, the prolonged nature of this strike will result
in lost demand as was evident the last time French strikers
disrupted deliveries,” analysts at JPMorgan led by Lawrence
Eagles in New York said in a note today.  The bank said the strike is more likely to support demand
in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter.   “Although the arbitrage is currently closed, prices
clearly reflect the possibility that it will reopen,” the bank
said refering to gasoil shipments from Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
