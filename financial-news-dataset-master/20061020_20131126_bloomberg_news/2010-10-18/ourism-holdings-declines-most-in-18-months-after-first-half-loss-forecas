Tourism Holdings Ltd. , the largest
campervan operator in New Zealand and Australia, fell the most
in more than 18 months in Wellington after forecasting a first-
half loss because of a decline in visitor spending.  The loss may be NZ$1 million ($757,000) in the six months
ended Dec. 31, from a profit of NZ$1.4 million a year earlier
the Auckland-based company said in a statement late yesterday.
The stock slumped 12.5 percent, the biggest fall since March 31
last year.  Tourism Holdings said the rising Australian dollar had
reduced visitor arrivals, curbed spending and encouraged
domestic customers to holiday overseas. Hire periods had
declined by about 10 percent as visitors reduced their length of
stay, it said.  In New Zealand, a stronger currency was curbing spending
and visitor arrivals, particularly from the U.K., fell in July
and August, it said. The company has lowered prices as demand
and forward bookings decline, it said.  The  stock  fell 11 cents, or 12.5 percent, to 77 cents at
the 5 p.m. market close in Wellington. Before today, the stock
had gained 17 percent in the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
