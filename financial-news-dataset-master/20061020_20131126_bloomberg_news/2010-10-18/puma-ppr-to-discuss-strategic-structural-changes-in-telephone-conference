Puma AG,  the sporting-goods maker
controlled by  PPR SA,  said “irregularities” at its Greek joint
venture will cause the company to write off as much as 115
million euros ($162 million).  About 15 million euros will be charged against this year’s
results, with the remainder applying to prior years, the
Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company said in a statement on the
DGAP newswire today. Puma  fell  as much as 4.5 percent in
Frankfurt trading, the steepest drop since July 29.  The company’s Greek joint venture partner and members of
the unit’s management are suspected of committing “a series of
criminal acts,” Puma said, citing the initial findings of an
independent audit. A new local management has been installed and
the irregularities have been halted, according to the statement.  Konstantinos Kotsiakis, chief operating officer of Puma
Hellas SA, said he couldn’t comment on the announcement or the
joint venture partner when reached at his Athens office.  Puma said it expects to incur one-time costs of as much as
30 million euros in the fourth quarter, including 15 million
euros as a result of the irregularities and the “general market
situation in Greece.” The company will also restate reported
figures for 2009.  PPR also said it will restate its financial statements to
reflect its controlling stake in Puma. The restatement will cut
2010 net income by about 20 million euros, the company said.  Puma  shares  were down 5.30 euros, or 2.1 percent, to 246.10
euros as of 10:03 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
