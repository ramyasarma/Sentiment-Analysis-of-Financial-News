China’s government bonds fell,
extending last week’s losses, on speculation a rally in the
nation’s stocks is attracting money away from the debt market.  China’s stocks rose for an eighth day, the longest rally in
11 months, as brokerages and airlines gained on improving
earnings prospects. Bonds issued by the finance ministry slid
last week after the central bank temporarily raised the deposit
reserve requirement for six banks temporarily.  “Bonds reacted to the stock-market performance with yields
rising slightly,” said Yuan Xinzhao, a bond analyst at Guotai
Junan Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Ample liquidity hasn’t
changed much.”  The yield on the 3.29 percent note due September 2020
climbed two basis points to 3.3 percent as of 12:18 p.m. in
Shanghai, according to data from the National Interbank Funding
Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The seven-day repurchase  rate , which measures lending costs
between banks, gained two basis points to 1.96 percent,
according to a daily fixing published by the Interbank Funding
Center.  Five-year swaps, the fixed rate needed to receive the
floating seven-day repo rate, were unchanged on 3.08 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Shanghai Composite  Index , which tracks the biggest of
China’s stock exchanges, gained 13.71, or 0.5 percent, to
2,984.87 at the 11:30 a.m. break. The 915-stock measure briefly
rose above 3,000 today, the first time since April. It has
rebounded 26 percent from its 2010 low on July 5, entering a so-
called bull market on Oct. 12.  -- Belinda Cao . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  Sandy Hendry   To contact the reporter on this story:
