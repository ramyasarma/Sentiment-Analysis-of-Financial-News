Australia will open two new
detention centers to house asylum-seekers, the Australian
newspaper reported on its website, citing Prime Minister  Julia Gillard .  The new centers, in Western Australia and South Australia,
will hold up to 1,500 men and 400 people respectively, the
newspaper said. Two other centers, in Darwin and Melbourne, are
also being planned, according to the report. Also, children and
vulnerable families will be moved in community accommodation
under the plan, the newspaper said.  Editor: Keith Gosman  To contact the reporter on this story:
