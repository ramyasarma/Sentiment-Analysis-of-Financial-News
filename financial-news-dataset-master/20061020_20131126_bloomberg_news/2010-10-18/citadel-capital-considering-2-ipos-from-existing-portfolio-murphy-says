Citadel Capital Corp., an Egyptian
private equity company, plans two initial public offerings from
its portfolio, Managing Director Stephen Murphy told reporters
in Abu Dhabi today.  The company is seeking to raise $175 million to $250
million from each of the share sales in the next two years, he
said. “More liquidity is coming into the market place; so we’ll
take this opportunity with some of the more mature companies in
our portfolio to consider a listing,” Murphy said.  Citadel would look at listing the companies in Egypt or on
“regional” stock markets, he said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
