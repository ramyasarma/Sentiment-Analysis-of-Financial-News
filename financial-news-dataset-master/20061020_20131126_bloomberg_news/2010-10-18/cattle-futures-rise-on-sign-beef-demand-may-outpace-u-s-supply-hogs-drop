Cattle rose to the highest price in
almost four weeks on signs that beef demand is outpacing the
supply of animals available to U.S. meatpackers. Hogs dropped to
an eight-month low.  Wholesale choice beef  at midday climbed to $1.559 a pound,
a two-week high, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. U.S.
 steer  prices rose to 96.4 cents a pound last week, up 1.7
percent from a week earlier. Meatpackers processed 128,000 head
of cattle today, or 1.5 percent less than the previous week.  Cattle supplies are “in good shape,” said  Lawrence Kane ,
a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in Yates City,
Illinois. “Numbers are down, and  weights  are reasonable, so
we’re not burying ourselves under a ton of beef.”  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1.00725 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.011, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Sept. 21. Last
week, the commodity climbed 1.3 percent, the third straight
gain.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.05 cent
to $1.0965 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.875 cent, or
1.3 percent, to 68.025 cents a pound. The price touched 67.8
cents in electronic trading after pit business ended, the lowest
level for a most-active contract since Feb. 12. Last week, the
commodity dropped 6.7 percent, the most since August 2009.  As of Oct. 14, hog carcasses  weighed  an average 207.6
pounds (94 kilograms) at slaughter in the U.S., the most since
April 2009, according to the USDA. Heavier hogs produce more
pork.  “The weather has been gorgeous for livestock, dry with low
humidity and cool temperatures, and that just makes the animal
perform well,” Kane said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
