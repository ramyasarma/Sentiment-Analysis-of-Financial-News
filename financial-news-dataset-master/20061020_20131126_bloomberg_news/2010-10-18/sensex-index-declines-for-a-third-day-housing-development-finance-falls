India’s stocks rose, reversing a
two-day drop, led by  Larsen & Toubro Ltd.  after its second-
quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Larsen & Toubro, the nation’s largest engineering company,
advanced for the first day in three.  Net income  climbed to 7.65
billion rupees ($172.6 million), exceeding the 6.6 billion-
rupees  mean estimate  of 24 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Tata
Steel Ltd. , the biggest producer, gained 1.6 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
gained 43.84, or 0.2 percent, to 20,168.89 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai after dropping as much as 1.3 percent. The gauge
fell 2.7 percent in the previous two days.  “Larsen added to confidence,” said  Deven Choksey , chief
executive officer at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt.,
which manages about $123 million in equities. Foreign investors
are buying when they see the index declining, he said.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  6.54 billion rupees  ($147.6
million) of Indian equities on Oct. 15, extending this year’s
record inflows to 1.07 trillion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  Larsen & Toubro advanced 1.4 percent to 2,015.4 rupees,
erasing an earlier drop of as much as 3 percent. Tata Steel
added 1.6 percent to 646.05 rupees.  Global Buyers  Global funds have been net buyers of stocks for 33 trading
days, the longest run of inflows in more than five years since
the 40-day period ended Aug. 9, 2005, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.2 percent to 6,075.95. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.1 percent
to 2,561.72.  This year’s 15 percent rally makes the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s 10 biggest stock markets. Foreign
fund inflows have surged 69 percent this year, making the gauge
the most expensive in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also
include Brazil, Russia and China.  Infosys Technologies Ltd. , the second-largest software
services exporter, advanced 1 percent to 3,107.05 rupees,
trimming its steepest drop in three months on Oct. 15 as the
rupee retreated from a two-year high per dollar. Larger rival
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.  jumped 3.3 percent to 981.25
rupees, reversing its biggest slide in a year. The two companies
get almost all of their sales abroad and the stronger rupee
reduces the value when converted to the local currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
