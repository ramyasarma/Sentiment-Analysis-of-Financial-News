Wheat futures fell the most in two
weeks on speculation that demand for the grain used in livestock 
feed will shrink as corn prices slump.  Corn, also a feed ingredient, dropped for the fourth
straight session in Chicago. Wheat prices have jumped 44 percent
since the end of June after drought in Russia and Eastern Europe
reduced output. Corn surged 49 percent in the same period as
U.S. yields declined.  Wheat “pulled back when corn pulled back” today, said
 Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit Commodity Brokerage in
Des Moines, Iowa. Earlier, a gain by the  dollar  eroded prospects
for U.S. grain exports, he said.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 14.5 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $6.90 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. That marked the biggest drop since Oct. 1. The
commodity declined 2.1 percent last week.  The U.S. may produce 2.224 billion bushels in the year
ending May 31, up 0.3 percent from last year, the government
said on Oct. 8.  “World fundamentals on wheat are OK at the moment, but the
market reacted more on fear,” said  Lawrence Kane , a market
adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in Yates City, Illinois.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
