Societe Generale SA is selling five-
year notes tied to the performance of emerging-market stocks.  The so-called cliquet notes pay the annual performance of
Societe Generale’s  SGI SLS Emerging 11% ER Index , which is
locked in at the end of each year when the starting level for
the subsequent period is reset, according to  Scoach , the
structured products trading platform where the notes are listed.  The securities, also known as ratchet notes, use embedded
options to pay the percentage gain of the index for the year
minus the best-performing month. Investors get their principal
back if the benchmark falls.  SocGen’s SGI SLS index has risen 6.4 percent this year. The
benchmark tracks a holding in the SGI Wise Emerging TR Index of
emerging stocks, and a short position in the  Dow Jones Global
Titans benchmark  of the world’s largest companies.  Options give investors the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell assets at a set date and price.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives such as options to offer
customized bets to investors while earning fees and raising
money. Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and even the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
