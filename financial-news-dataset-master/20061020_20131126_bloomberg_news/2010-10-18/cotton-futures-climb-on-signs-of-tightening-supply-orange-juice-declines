Cotton futures rose on mounting
signs of a global shortfall. Orange-juice prices gained.  Cotton sales in India, the world’s second-biggest producer,
have dropped in the season that started Oct. 1 as an extended
monsoon delayed harvests,  Cotton Corp. of India  said. Prices in
New York soared to a record last week. As of Oct. 15, warehouse
 inventories  monitored by ICE Futures U.S. plunged to 11,182
bales from this year’s high of 1.081 million on June 2.  “There’s still undoubtedly a shortage of available
cotton,” said  Tom Reardon , the president of Delta Brokerage in
New York. “There’s still a lot of unknown as far as the harvest
in most of the world. There still can be quality issues.”  Cotton for December delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 3.2
percent, to settle at $1.1337 a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price declined as much as
1.7 percent. The fiber has jumped 50 percent in 2010.  In the previous session, the commodity dropped by the
exchange’s limit of 5 cents after climbing to $1.198, the
highest level since cotton started trading 140 years go.  The fiber “may have made a temporary top,” Reardon said.
Prices are “very susceptible to exaggerated movement at the
moment,” he said.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 1.1 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $1.4935 a pound. The price has climbed 16
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
