Argentine issuers from Empresa
Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte SA to the province of
Cordoba are selling debt in international markets at the fastest
pace in more than a decade as borrowing costs tumble.  The $140 million offering by Edenor, as the country’s
biggest power distributor is known, pushed the number of issuers
last week to four, the most for the period since at least 1999,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Argentine provinces and
companies may raise another $2 billion in overseas markets by
year-end after placing $636 million last week, according to
 Bevan Rosenbloom , an emerging-market debt strategist with RBS
Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut.  Government yields , the benchmark for the country’s issuers,
sank to 8.85 percent, the lowest since February 2008, after
record-low interest rates in the U.S. and Europe sparked demand
for emerging-market assets. Cordoba, whose B3 rating from
Moody’s Investors Service is six levels below investment grade,
paid 12.375 percent on $196 million of bonds due 2017. In
neighboring Brazil, beef producer JBS SA, rated B1, sold $200
million of 2018 notes to yield 7.875 percent last month.  “The yields are very high compared to everywhere else,”
 Eric Ollom , chief emerging-markets strategist with Jefferies &
Co. in New York, said in a phone interview. “The biggest
attraction is the fact that yields are between 10 and 13
percent, compared to single-B credits in Brazil that are 8 to 9
percent.”  Edenor, based in Buenos Aires, sold bonds due in 2022 to
yield 9.75 percent, or 511 basis points more than the average
yield for securities sold by Latin American utility companies,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG’s LABI index. A basis point
equals 0.01 percentage point.  IMPSA, Buenos Aires  Industrias Metalurgicas Pescarmona SA, a maker of turbines
and generators also based in Buenos Aires, issued $50 million
more of notes due in 2020 to yield 10.54 percent. The company
initially sold $275 million of the securities on Sept. 22 to
yield 10.75 percent.  Buenos Aires province also returned to the market last week
after selling $550 million of five-year bonds on Sept. 27. The
local government issued $250 million of the securities to yield
11.5 percent on Oct. 13, down 50 basis points since the
September sale.  Argentine  government bonds  yielded an average of 9.04
percent on Oct. 15, down from 10.29 percent at the beginning of
September, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ index. The
average yield on Brazilian government debt fell to 4.78 percent
last week, down from 5.11 percent at the start of last month.
The average Argentine yield reached 8.85 percent on Oct. 13.  Default Swap  “The re-tap of Buenos Aires, Cordoba and IMPSA has to do
with falling sovereign yields that permitted them to come to
market cheaper than when they did during the past couple of
months,” said  Francisco Velasco , an analyst with Exotix Ltd. in
Buenos Aires.  The  cost  of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps jumped 32 basis points
to 721 on Oct. 15, according to data provider CMA. Credit-
default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to adhere to debt agreements.  Warrants linked to growth were unchanged at 12.55 cents at
10:19 a.m. New York time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The peso slid 0.1 percent to 3.9566 per U.S. dollar.  Yields on Argentine bonds due in 2017 fell nine basis
points to 8.45 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Provinces and companies are filling a void created by
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ’s decision to put off
the government’s return to international bond markets for the
first time since Argentina defaulted on a record $95 billion in
2001. Fernandez, 57, said Sept. 24 she doesn’t want to pay a
yield as high as 8 percent.  Issuance Pickup  Argentine issuance totaled $465 million last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While Argentine
issuance is picking up in 2010, the country’s bond sales of $2.6
billion so far this year remain below the $13.5 billion borrowed
in 1999, two years before the 2001 default, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Argentina’s economic expansion and restructuring of $12.2
billion in defaulted debt in June are helping lower borrowing
costs for the companies and provinces, RBS’s Rosenbloom said.
The central bank forecasts Argentina’s economy will grow 9.5
percent this year, the fastest pace since 1992.  Companies and governments that may sell debt by the end of
the year include Arcor, Argentina’s biggest candymaker,
Cablevision, a cable television provider, and the province of
Santa Fe, Rosenbloom said.  “The positive momentum from the sovereign restructuring is
impacting borrowing costs, increasing the availability of
capital and the access to capital for certain issuers,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
