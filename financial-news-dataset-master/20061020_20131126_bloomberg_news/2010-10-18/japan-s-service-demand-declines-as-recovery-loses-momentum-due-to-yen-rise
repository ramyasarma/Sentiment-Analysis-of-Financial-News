Japan’s demand for services fell
for the first time in three months in August, adding to signs
of a weakening  recovery .  The  tertiary index  fell 0.2 percent from July, when it
rose 1.6 percent, the Trade Ministry said today in Tokyo. The
median forecast of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
was for a 0.5 percent decline.  The report supports Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s case for
compiling a second economic package as the yen approaches a
record high against the dollar, threatening Japan’s export-
reliant recovery. Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa 
said last week the nation’s return to sustainable growth is
likely to be delayed.  “Japan’s slowing economy is highly unlikely to pick up
this year at least,” said  Masamichi Adachi , senior economist
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo. “A global slowdown is
threatening Japan’s recovery because households aren’t strong
enough to make up for weak exports.”  Kan’s cabinet this month endorsed a 5.1 trillion yen
($63 billion) stimulus plan to safeguard the economy and help
local governments and small businesses cope with the surging
yen as consumer spending, which accounts for more than half
of economy, remains sluggish.  The yen is trading at 81.33 per dollar at 8:59 a.m.,
close to a record high of 79.75 marked in April 1995. Japan
intervened in the currency market last month for the first
time in six years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
