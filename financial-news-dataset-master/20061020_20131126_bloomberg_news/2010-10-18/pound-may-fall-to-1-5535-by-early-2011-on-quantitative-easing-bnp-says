The pound may decline to $1.5535 as
investors anticipate further asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing, by the Bank of England in early 2011,
according to BNP Paribas SA.  “Wednesday’s Bank of England minutes will reveal the first
steps towards further QE measures in the U.K.,” analysts led by
 Hans-Guenter Redeker  in London wrote in a note to clients today.
“Pound-dollar is already breaking lower through initial support
and is now sitting on up trendline support at the $1.5835 level.
A break below here will open downside pressure towards the
$1.5535 area.”  The U.K. currency fell 0.6 percent to $1.5890 at 2.34 p.m.
in London.  The Centre for Economics and Business Research yesterday
said the Bank of England will expand its debt-purchase stimulus
program by 100 billion pounds ($160 billion) and keep its
benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent until at
least late 2012 to bolster the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
