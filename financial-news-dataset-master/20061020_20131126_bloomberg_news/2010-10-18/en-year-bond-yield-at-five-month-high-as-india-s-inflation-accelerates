India’s  10-year bond yield  rose to
the highest level in more than five months on speculation
investors will pare their holdings after inflation unexpectedly
accelerated.  Yields climbed to the highest level since April as banks
borrowed an  average  of 756 billion rupees ($17 billion) each day
from the central bank’s repurchase auction window last week,
compared with 114 billion rupees in the previous week,
reflecting tighter cash conditions. The benchmark wholesale-
 price index  rose 8.62 percent in September from a year earlier
after an 8.5 percent gain in August, according to a commerce
ministry statement published on Oct. 15.  “Inflation continues to be a concern as the data was not
positive,” said  Rajeev Radhakrishnan , who manages the
equivalent of $4 billion of debt in Mumbai at SBI Funds
Management Pvt., a unit of the nation’s biggest bank. “The
tight liquidity is also putting additional pressure on bonds.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose two
basis points to 8.09 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. That was the
highest since April. The price fell 0.17, or 17 paise per 100
rupee face amount, to 98.08.  The central bank lent 894.6 billion rupees to banks at its
repurchase auction today.  The  Reserve Bank of India  has raised its benchmark rate
five times this year to slow the increase in prices. The central
bank next meets to review monetary policy Nov. 2.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, rose four basis points to 6.72
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
