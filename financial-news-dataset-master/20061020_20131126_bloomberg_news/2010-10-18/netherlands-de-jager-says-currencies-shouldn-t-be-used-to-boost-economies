Governments shouldn’t push down
their currencies to boost their economies as it leads to unfair
competition, Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said.  “Currency rates should not be used as a means of
competition, because it will lead to unfair competition,” De
Jager told reporters ahead of a meeting of European Union
counterparts in Luxembourg. “So we are against it.”  Countries from China to Japan are seeking to restrain their
currencies, roiling markets and prompting Brazil’s Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  to say on Sept. 27 that there’s a
worldwide “currency war.” European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday that that volatility in
foreign-exchange markets is “counterproductive.”  “They should use their competitiveness on the labor
markets, competitiveness on the labor costs, competitive of
their production and innovation as a means of competing, but not
currency rates,” said De Jager, who was reappointed as finance
minister in the new Dutch government last week.  The yen strengthened to 81.22 per dollar today, close to a
15-year high of 80.88 on Oct. 15. The euro declined to $1.3870
from $1.3977 on Oct. 15, when it reached $1.4159, the most since
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
