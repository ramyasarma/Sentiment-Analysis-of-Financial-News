Sanyo Electric Co ., the world’s
biggest maker of rechargeable batteries, said it plans to slash
the cost of manufacturing lithium-ion batteries used in cars to
less than half the current industry average in five years.  The company plans to lower the cost to less than 50 yen per
watt hour in 2015, compared with the industry average of about
100 yen now,  Hiroshi Ikeuchi , an executive officer for Sanyo’s
hybrid electric vehicle division, told reporters at a new
battery plant in Kasai city, near Osaka. He declined to specify
Sanyo’s current manufacturing cost.  The Kasai plant added facilities in July to boost Sanyo’s
capacity of lithium-ion car batteries 11-fold to 1.1 million a
month. The Osaka-based company may add a manufacturing line at
the plant to make large-capacity cells for plug-in hybrid and
all-electric cars by March 2011, raising its output ability to
as high as 1.5 million units a month.  Sanyo fell 0.7 percent to close at 136 yen in Tokyo
trading, extending its loss this year to 20 percent.  Panasonic
Corp ., the world’s largest maker of plasma televisions, holds 81
percent of Sanyo after a tender offer that closed this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
