Rising food prices prompted
Brazilian economists to raise their 2010 inflation forecast for
a fifth straight week, according to a central bank survey.  Consumer price inflation will quicken to 5.20 percent in
2010, compared with a week-earlier forecast of 5.15 percent,
according to the median forecast in an Oct. 15 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today. Consumer prices
will rise 4.99 percent in 2011, from a week earlier forecast of
4.98 percent, the survey found.  “It’s a short-term question, mainly due to food prices,”
said  Solange Srour , chief economist in Rio de Janeiro at BNY
Mellon ARX. “Inflation expectations in 2011 are anchored and
aren’t on an upward trend.”  Policy makers will wait to see how the global economy fares
next year before deciding on their next move, Srour said.  Analysts expect the central bank to resume  interest rate 
increases in April to bring inflation back toward the mid-point
of its target range. Policy makers held the benchmark rate
unchanged at 10.75 percent at their Aug. 31-Sept. 1 meeting,
after raising it 200 basis points this year from a record low
8.75 percent.  Real  Analysts forecast that the real will end the year trading
at 1.70 per dollar, from a week-earlier forecast of 1.75, the
survey found.  The real weakened 0.3 percent to 1.6697 per dollar at 9:06
a.m. New York time from 1.6651 on Oct. 15. The yield on the
interest rate future contract maturing in January 2012 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 11.25 percent.  Brazil’s retail sales rose at a faster-than-expected 2.0
percent in August from a month earlier, fueled by record low
unemployment and credit expansion.  The country’s  unemployment  rate unexpectedly fell to 6.7
percent in August. At the same time,  bank lending  expanded in
August at its fastest pace since July 2009, according to central
bank figures.  Policy makers forecast inflation will slow to 4.6 percent
next year should the benchmark rate remain unchanged at 10.75
percent, according to a Sept 30 report. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points.  The bank holds its second-last monetary policy meeting of
2010 on Oct. 19-20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
