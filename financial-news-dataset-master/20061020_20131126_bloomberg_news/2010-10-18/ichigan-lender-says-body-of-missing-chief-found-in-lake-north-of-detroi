Community Central Bank Corp. , the
lender based in Mount Clemens, Michigan, said police think they
have found the body of Chief Executive Officer  David Widlak , who
went missing last month.  The remains were discovered yesterday evening in Lake St.
Clair in Macomb County, 27 miles north of Detroit, according to
a company statement today. The bank named Chief Financial
Officer  Ray Colonius  acting CEO Sept. 22. The cause of death
hasn’t been determined, the Detroit News reported, citing
Sheriff Mark Hackel. Hackel didn’t return a phone call seeking
comment.  “The staff, management and board of Community Central Bank
are deeply saddened to learn of this development,” Colonius
said in the statement. “For our customers, Community Central
Bank continues to operate with no disruptions under the bank’s
executives and staff members. Our succession plan contemplates
all circumstances including tragedies such as this.”  The bank, based in a town of about 16,000 people, had
$540.3 million in assets as of June 30. The lender, which
 reported a loss  of $14.6 million last year, traded at a peak of
$14.55 in February 2005. The stock  fell  6.1 percent today to 62
cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  Widlak, a licensed attorney, also served as an arbitrator
for the American Arbitration Association, according to a
biography that was previously posted on the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
