Havas SA , owner of the Euro RSCG
Worldwide advertising agency, said third-quarter revenue rose
5.3 percent, helped by currency fluctuations and a rebounding
advertising market in the U.S. and U.K.  Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and mergers,
totalled 368 million euros ($513.7 million) for the quarter, the
company said in a statement today. Nine-month sales by the same
standard rose 2.9 percent to 1.1 billion euros.  Havas, controlled by French billionaire  Vincent Bollore ,
won 408 million euros worth of new business from clients
including PSA Peugeot Citroen, Barclays Plc and Yum! Brands
Inc.’s Pizza Hut. The company, based in the Paris suburb of
Suresnes, is seeking acquisitions in Asia-Pacific and in Latin
America in digital media and health care, David Jones, the head
of Havas Worldwide and Euro RSCG, said last month.  Bollore, who owns about 32 percent of Havas, also has 29.9
percent in the U.K.’s  Aegis Group Plc , the world’s largest
independent buyer of ad space.  Havas said nine-month net new business totalled 1.6 billion
euros, an increase of 42 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
