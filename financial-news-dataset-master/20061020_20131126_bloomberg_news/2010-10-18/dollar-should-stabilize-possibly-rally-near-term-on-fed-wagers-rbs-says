The dollar may  rebound  on bets the
Federal Reserve may add less monetary stimulus than traders are
predicting, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “The market is well short the dollar especially against
the higher yielding and emerging-market currencies, but also
significantly against the euro and yen where on fundamental
grounds it is less clear that it should be,”  Greg Gibbs , a
currency strategist in Sydney, wrote today in a report. “Given
the need for the Fed to worry more that it has promised too much
too soon, the near-term outlook for the dollar should be to
stabilize and potentially rally. At this stage it would be
prudent to lock in some gains on dollar shorts.”  The dollar appreciated 0.6 percent to $1.3895 per euro as
of 7:58 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
