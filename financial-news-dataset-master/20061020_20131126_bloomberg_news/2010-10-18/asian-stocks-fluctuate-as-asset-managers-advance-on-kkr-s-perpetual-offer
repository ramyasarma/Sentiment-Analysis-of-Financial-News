Asian  stocks  fell having completed a
seventh weekly advance, with material companies leading declines
after BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group scrapped a joint
venture and commodity prices slumped.  BHP  sank 1.1 percent as the companies abandoned a plan to
create the world’s largest iron-ore producer.  Cnooc Ltd. ,
China’s biggest offshore oil producer, dropped 1.5 percent in
Hong Kong as crude oil fell in New York. HSBC Holdings Plc,
which gets 30 percent of its revenue from the Asia Pacific, lost

as of 6:16 p.m. in Tokyo today after reaching its highest level
since July 2008 last week. About five stocks fell for every
three that rose on the nearly 1,000-member gauge, which
increased as much as 0.2 percent earlier. The measure completed
its seventh weekly advance last week, the longest winning streak
since 2006.  “After such a run-up in risk assets, the market was
vulnerable to a correction,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based
head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages $85 billion. “A lot of the potential good news has been
factored in and investors may be thinking it’s not a bad time to
take profits.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  lost less than 0.1 percent.

percent, its steepest since Sept. 8.  Technology Shares  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  retreated 0.7
percent. The U.S. index rose 0.2 percent on Oct. 15 in New York
as companies such as  Google Inc.  fueled a rally in technology
shares that helped offset a decline in bank shares and an
unexpected drop in consumer confidence.  BHP Billiton slipped 1.1 percent to A$41.18 in Sydney after
abandoning a plan with  Rio Tinto Group  to create the world’s
largest iron-ore exporter, following opposition from regulators
in Europe and Asia.  Rio  slipped 0.3 percent to A$82.98.  Crude oil for November delivery declined 1.7 percent on Oct.
15 in New York to $81.25 a barrel, the lowest settlement this

Exchange Index  of six metals including aluminum and copper
slipped 0.4 percent on Oct. 15, the biggest drop since Oct. 7.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. , Australia’s largest gold producer,

percent to HK$9.88. Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s largest gold
producer, plunged 4.7 percent to HK$7.46 after the company said
it faces legal claims in connection with a deadly dam collapse
at a mine.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has risen 8.1 percent this year
on speculation growth in corporate profits will weather Europe’s
debt crisis, Chinese steps to curb property-price inflation and
concern about the pace of the U.S. economic rebound. Stocks in
the gauge trade at 14.2 times estimated profit on average,
compared with 14 times for the  S&P 500  and 12.2 times for the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  ‘Policy Stimulus’  Investors are waiting to see “what’s coming in the way of
policy stimulus in the U.S. and elsewhere,” said  Stephen Halmarick , who helps manage about $135 billion as head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney.  Bank stocks across the region fell, led by HSBC, which sank
2.5 percent to HK$80.85 in Hong Kong after five Taiwanese
lenders sued it over its role in an alleged fraud they say cost
them more than $500 million in damages.  China Construction Bank
Corp. , the country’s second-largest lender, retreated 1.9
percent to HK$7.30.  “One area to avoid at the moment would be mainland Chinese
banks due to their valuations,” said  Castor Pang , research
director at Cinda International Holdings Ltd. “In a volatile
market, funds tend to make their way into the financial sector
so once a correction takes place, money pulls out first from
this sector.”  Industrial Bank of Korea, South Korea’s largest lender to
small-and medium-sized companies, sank 3.8 percent to 16,550 won
in Seoul. In Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest business lender, lost 0.7 percent to A$25.32.  Mazda dropped 0.9 percent to 212 yen in Tokyo after the

become Mazda’s largest shareholder by the end of the year.  In Taipei, HTC Corp., the world’s largest maker of handsets
using Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. operating systems, tumbled
