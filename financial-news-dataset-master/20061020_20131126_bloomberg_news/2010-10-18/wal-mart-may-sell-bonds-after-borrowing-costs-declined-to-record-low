Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
biggest retailer, may sell bonds after borrowing costs fell to a
record low last week.  Wal-Mart  may issue debt maturing in 3, 5, 10 and 30 years
in a benchmark offering as soon as today, according to a person
familiar with the transaction. Proceeds may be used for general
corporate purposes, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  Wal-Mart is marketing the securities as yields on U.S.
investment-grade corporate debt fell as low as 3.55 percent last
week, the lowest borrowing cost on record in data going back to
October 1986, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index. Sales at the company’s U.S. stores open at least a year
will be “positive” in the fourth quarter, after five
consecutive periods of decline, Chief Executive Officer  Mike Duke  said at an investor conference on Oct. 13.  The bond offering follows Wal-Mart’s $3 billion, three-part
debt sale in June, which was the Bentonville, Arkansas-based
company’s largest since 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  A $750 million, five-year portion of that transaction
traded at 103.9 cents on the dollar to yield 21 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries on Oct. 15, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The $1.5 billion of 10-year notes traded
at 105.8 cents to pay a 51 basis-point spread on Oct. 13, Trace
data show.  Wal-Mart’s $750 million of 4.875 percent bonds due in July
2040 traded at 99.8 cents and paid a spread of 97 basis points
on Oct. 14, the data show.  Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Barclays Plc, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
are managing the sale, the person said. Wal-Mart is ranked Aa2
by Moody’s Investors Service and AA by Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
