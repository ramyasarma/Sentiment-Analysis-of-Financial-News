Bank of America Corp.  today hired
 Eiichi Katayama  from  Nomura Holdings Inc.  as a managing director
leading research on Japanese consumer electronics, according to
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  Katayama, 44, will also manage coverage of
telecommunications, media and technology as well as basic
material industries, the document said. Katayama was rated the
best analyst of consumer electronics by Institutional Investor
and the Nikkei Veritas newspaper in 2010.  Tsukasa Noda , a Tokyo-
based spokesman at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of
Bank of America, confirmed the contents of the memo.  Bank of America aims to boost equity research in Japan to
360 companies from 318 by Dec. 31,  Yohei Osade , the company’s
head of Japan research, said in an interview in April.
Katayama’s team covers 130 companies and almost 30 percent of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s market capitalization, the memo said.  Katayama joined Nomura in 1989 after graduating from Keio
University. He has a Master of Business Administration degree
from Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of
Management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
