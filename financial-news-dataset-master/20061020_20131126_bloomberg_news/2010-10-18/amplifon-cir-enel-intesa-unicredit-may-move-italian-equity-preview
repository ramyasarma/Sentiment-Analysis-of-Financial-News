Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
gained 196.41, or 0.9 percent, to 21,258.59, a first increase in
three days, at the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  (BMPS IM) advanced 1.6
percent to 1.05 euros. The euro interbank offered rate, or
Euribor, for three-month loans increased almost one basis point
to 1 percent, the highest level since July 10, 2009, data from
the European Banking Federation showed today.  The upward move in the Euribor “has a positive read for
the Italian banks sector,” Hammer Partners said in a note,
highlighting that “each 5 basis-point increase in the Euribor
will have a 1 percent increase in the net interest income and a
2.5 percent increase in the net profit.”  Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl  (PMI IM) gained 2 percent to
3.56 euros.  Banco Popolare  (BP IM) rose 1.4 percent to 4.26
euros.  Compagnie Industriale Riunite SpA  (CIR IM) increased 1.1
percent to 1.61 euros. CIR’s Sorgenia SpA posted net income of
57.6 million euros ($80.4 million) in the first nine months
compared with 21.1 million euros a year earlier.  Enel SpA  (ENEL IM) rose 1 percent to 3.99 euros. The power
company began taking orders for shares in its Enel Green Power
SpA unit today. Enel Chief Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti ,
speaking at a press conference in Milan, said there’s interest
for Enel Green Power from “core investors.” Enel plans to cut
its debt to 39 billion euros by 2014, he said.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM) gained 2.4 percent to 2.58
euros, a second consecutive increase. Italy’s second-biggest
bank agreed to buy a 51 percent stake in Banca Monte Parma SpA
for 159 million euros. Banca Akros reiterated a “buy” rating,
saying the deal is “a good strategic move,” though “at a high
price. The limited size of the acquisition will however have a
limited impact on the group fundamentals.”  Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM), the world’s second-biggest cable
maker, advanced 1 percent to 14.13 euros, snapping a two-day
loss. Nexans SA rose as much as 2.9 percent after the world’s
biggest maker of cables and wires said it will start talks to
buy Dutch cable maker Draka Holding NV for 15 euros a share.  Fidentiis Equities SV SA reiterated a “hold” rating on
Prysmian. “Positive outlook is confirmed on non-cyclical
businesses, while it is only moderately and gradually improving
on cyclical,” the brokerage said.  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM), Italy’s biggest lender, rose 2.4
percent to 1.9 euros, ending a two-day decline. The bank agreed
with unions on job reductions in Italy with 3,000 employees
leaving the company by 2013, according to a statement from labor
union FALCRI. A total of 4,700 will leave the bank over the next
five years, the statement said.  Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA  (UBI IM), Italy’s fourth-
largest bank, advanced 2.4 percent to 7.86 euros, extending
gains of 1.6 percent on Oct. 15. The shares are recouping some
ground after underperforming so far this year, said  Gabriele Roghi , head of portfolio management at Invest Banca SpA in
Empoli, Italy. He noted that “from a technical point of view,
the stock could reach 9 euros should it rise above the 8.3-8.4
euro threshold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
