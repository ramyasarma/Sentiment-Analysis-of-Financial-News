Assa Abloy AB  the world’s largest
maker of locks, said its 100 million-euro ($139 million)
purchase of a minority stake in Groupe Agta Record may be a
prelude to a full-blown merger with its Swiss rival.  Assa Abloy agreed to pay 25 euros a share to acquire 32.9
percent of the automatic door-systems maker, the Stockholm-based
company said today in a statement. The seller of the 4.4 million
shares is Somfy SA. The price is 46 percent higher than Agta’s
closing price on Oct. 15.  “We’re interested in possibly merging the two companies in
the long term,” Chief Executive Officer  Johan Molin  said in a
phone interview today.  Molin said Agta complements Assa Abloy’s existing division
supplying electronic entrance systems for hotels and other
buildings. Assa Abloy is interested in buying more shares in
Agta, which has 1,700 employees and annual  sales  of 222 million
euros, though there is no immediate plan to take full control,
Molin said.  Assa Abloy is maintaining its long-term strategy of adding
some 5 percent to revenue each year through acquisitions, Molin
said.  The CEO said in an interview in May that the company had
already exceeded that target.  Agta  soared  as much as 30 percent, the most since May 1998,
and traded up 25 percent at 21.20 euros in Paris trading as of
10:16 a.m.  Assa Abloy  fell  0.8 percent to 167.20 kronor in
Stockholm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
