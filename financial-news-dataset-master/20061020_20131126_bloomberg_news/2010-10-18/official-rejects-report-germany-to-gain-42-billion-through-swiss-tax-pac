German talks with Switzerland on the
taxation of legacy assets are going “well and constructively”
and a working group will likely prepare for formal negotiations
on the issue this fall, Finance Ministry spokesman Michael Offer
said today in Berlin. Press reports about 30 billion euros in
additional tax revenue “lack any foundation,” Offer said,
declining to give an estimate.   Germany and Switzerland are likely to finalize a separate
double-taxation agreement by the end of the month, Offer said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
