The Saskatchewan government isn’t
convinced that a takeover of  Potash Corp.  of Saskatchewan Inc.
by  BHP Billiton Ltd.  is in the province’s best interests, the
Globe and Mail said.  The province is concerned that it would lose billions of
dollars in taxes and royalties if BHP’s $38.6 billion offer
succeeds, the newspaper reported today, citing an interview with
Energy and Resources Minister  Bill Boyd .  Boyd gave this interview before Saskatchewan announces
whether it supports the takeover, the newspaper said. The
federal government will announce by Nov. 3 whether a purchase by
BHP would be a net benefit to Canada, and will take into
consideration Saskatchewan’s views, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
