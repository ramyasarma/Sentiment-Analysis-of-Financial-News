Alecto Energy Plc is yet to receive
confirmation from the Mauritanian government that its
application for a gold exploration license in the country has
been accepted, the company said in a statement today.  On Oct. 14 Mohamed Abdellahi Ould Oudaa, the country’s
mines minister, announced that the license had been awarded to a
unit of Alecto.  Alecto shares rose as much a 0.88 pence, or 35 percent, to
3.38 pence, and traded at 3 pence as of 12:15 p.m. Johannesburg
time. The shares gained 18 percent on Oct. 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
