The forint will likely gain versus
Poland’s zloty as the Hungarian currency offers a higher yield
than its central European peers,  Danske Bank A/S  said.  Investors should buy the forint at 1.42 zloty per 100
forint, and expect it to appreciate to 1.53 in one to three
months, Danske Bank analysts led by  Lars Christensen  wrote in a
report to clients today.  A “currency war” has boosted demand for higher-yielding
assets, Danske Bank wrote. Record-low rates in developed
countries have encouraged investors to borrow cheaply and invest
in emerging markets with higher returns, a strategy known as a
carry-trade.  “In this context, the forint is attractive compared with
for example the lower-yielding Polish and Czech currencies,”
the analysts wrote. “We see potential for further forint
strength, given the continued ‘carry-hunting’ global
environment.”  The benchmark interest rate in Hungary is 5.25 percent,
compared with 3.5 percent in Poland, 0.75 percent in the Czech
Republic and a range of zero to 0.25 percent for U.S. Federal
Reserve’s target rate.  Finance ministers and central bankers of the G-20 nations
will meet on Oct. 22 and 23 in South Korea to discuss
differences over currency policy. China is accused of
undervaluing the yuan to help its exports while the low U.S.
interest rates are blamed for flooding higher-yielding emerging
markets with capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
