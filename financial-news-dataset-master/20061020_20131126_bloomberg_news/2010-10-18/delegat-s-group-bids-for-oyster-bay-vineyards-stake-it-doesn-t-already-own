Delegat’s Group Ltd. , New Zealand’s
biggest publicly traded wine maker, plans to make a takeover
offer for 45 percent of  Oyster Bay Marlborough Vineyards Ltd. 
that it doesn’t already own.  Delegat’s will offer NZ$1.80 a share, or alternatively one
of its shares for one Oyster Bay share, the Auckland-based
company said in a statement. The bid would cost NZ$7.3 million
($6 million) if settled in all cash.  Oyster Bay shares last traded at NZ$1.60 on Oct. 12. The
company, which grows grapes and supplies them to Delegat’s, in
June said it was seeking advice on the most efficient capital
structure. The company is in breach of its banking covenants
because of a slump in grape prices and is operating under a
waiver from its lenders.  Delegat’s considers grape prices are unlikely to improve
significantly and in the short term any improvement in Oyster
Bay’s financial situation is unlikely, it said. It holds 54.9
percent of Oyster Bay.  Delegat’s  stock  rose 5 cents, or 3.1 percent, to NZ$1.69 at
2:06 p.m. in Wellington trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
