The seven-day rally for the Shanghai
Composite Index is a “rare occurrence” and bears the hallmark
of a bull market, according to China International Capital Corp.  Hao Hong, CICC’s Beijing-based global equity strategist,
recommended buying Chinese stocks “on dips.” The benchmark
index climbed for an eighth day today, rising 0.5 percent to
2,984.87 by the 11:30 a.m. break.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
