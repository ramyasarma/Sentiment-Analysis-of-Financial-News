European Central Bank member Ewald
Nowotny said that the bank won’t intervene to stop the euro’s
appreciation against the dollar, according to Vienna’s
WirtschaftsBlatt newspaper.  “The ECB has no exchange rate goal, therefore there also
isn’t any intention to intervene,” Nowotny said in an interview
with the paper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
