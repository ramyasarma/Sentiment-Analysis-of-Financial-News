Three former U.K. lawmakers accused
of abusing their expenses told Britain’s highest court that
parliamentary privilege protects them from being tried in the
criminal courts.  U.K. prosecutors in February charged the men,  Elliot Morley ,  David Chaytor  and  Jim Devine , over the false accounting
of their expenses while serving as Labour Party members of
Parliament. Two lower courts have ruled that the men should be
tried in a criminal court.  Nigel Pleming, a lawyer for the men, told the Supreme Court
in London that the lawmakers didn’t claim to be above the law.
He said they were bringing the case to determine the correct
location for a trial.  “We submit that it is in Parliament, and only Parliament
that the statements made to Parliament can be questioned or
impugned.”  Pleming said that because the lawmakers filed their
expenses statements into the parliament’s Fees Office, the
expenses are covered by the privilege rule.  The case is: R v Chaytor & Others (Appellants).  To contact the reporter on this story:
