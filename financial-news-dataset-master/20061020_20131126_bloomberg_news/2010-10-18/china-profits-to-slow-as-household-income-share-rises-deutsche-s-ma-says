Corporate profit growth will slow in
China to 10 to 11 percent a year by 2015 from over 20 percent
currently as the government boosts the share of household income
in the economy, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  China’s 12th five-year economic plan will provide strong
policy support for the agricultural and services industries, Ma
Jun, Deutsche Bank’s greater China chief economist, said in e-
mailed comments. The outlook is negative for industries that
rely on real estate and infrastructure growth and use raw
materials intensively, Ma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
