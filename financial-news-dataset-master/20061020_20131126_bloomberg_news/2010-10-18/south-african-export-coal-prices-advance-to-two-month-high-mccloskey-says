Prices for coal shipped from South
Africa’s Richards Bay, the continent’s biggest export facility
for the fuel, climbed to the highest level in more than two
months. Benchmark European coal derivatives declined.  Export prices rose 0.5 percent to an average of $89.03 a
metric ton in the week to Oct. 15, the highest price since the
week ended Aug. 6, according to IHS McCloskey. The fuel gained
for a fourth week, the longest winning streak since January. The
data are an average based on daily price assessments and a
market survey.  European  coal  for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year lost 0.2 percent to $101.25 a
ton at 10:51 a.m. in London. The fuel climbed to a 10-week high
of $101.90 on Oct. 14 and last week gained 2.1 percent, the most
in more than four months.  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for next year,
the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 4.32 euros ($6.01) a
megawatt-hour, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses
electricity prices in Germany and takes emissions costs into
account.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
supplied by ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc., Spectron Group Ltd.,
Credit Suisse Group AG, IHS McCloskey, Bloomberg and Tradition
Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
