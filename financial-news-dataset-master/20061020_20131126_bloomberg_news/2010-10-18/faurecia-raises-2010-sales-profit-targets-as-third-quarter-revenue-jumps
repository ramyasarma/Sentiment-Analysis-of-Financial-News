Faurecia SA , Europe’s largrest maker
of car interiors, raised its 2010 targets after quarterly sales
climbed 44 percent, lifted by the company’s emissions-control
business and increasing demand in North America and Asia.  Third-quarter revenue was 3.27 billion euros ($4.5
billion), compared with 2.27 billion euros a year earlier,
Faurecia said in a statement. Faurecia is now seeking an
increase, excluding currencies, of between 17 percent and 19
percent in 2010 product sales, an operating margin over 400
million euros and net cash flow above 150 million euros.  Previous targets were to raise 2010 product sales by as
much as 16 percent, with an operating margin of more than 340
million euros and net cash flow exceeding 100 million euros.  Faurecia, which rose 12 percent last year,  fell  19 cents,
or 1 percent, to 19.33 euros at 10:28 a.m. on the Paris
exchange. The stock is up 27 percent this year, valuing the
company at 2.1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
