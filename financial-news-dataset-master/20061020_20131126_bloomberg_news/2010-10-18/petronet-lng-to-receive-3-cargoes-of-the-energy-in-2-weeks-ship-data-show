Petronet LNG Ltd. , India’s biggest
importer of liquefied natural gas, will receive three cargoes of
the fuel in the coming two weeks, ship-tracking data show.  The shipments include two spot cargoes. Al Deebel, a
142,795 cubic-meter tanker owned by Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd., may
arrive at Dahej port on Oct. 19 carrying the cleaner-burning
fuel from Qatar, according to transmissions from ships captured
by AISLive on Bloomberg.  Castillo de Villalba, a 138,000 cubic-meter tanker, may
reach Dahej on Oct. 27 with a cargo from Point Fortin, Trinidad,
according to the data. Raahi may reach the terminal today
carrying a term supply from Qatar. The terminal on India’s west
coast received its first spot shipment this year from Trinidad &
Tobago in April.  Petronet may buy one cargo a month starting in October
after BG shut production at Panna-Mukta fields off India’s west
coast in July,  Amitava Sengupta , director of finance and
commercial, said in August. BG Group Plc halted about 35,000
barrels a day of oil output and 205 million cubic feet a day of
gas production on July 20 after a leak in a submarine pipeline.  LNG is created by cooling gas to about minus 260 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 162 degrees Celsius), shrinking it to about a
600th of the original volume, according to the U.S. Department
of Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
