Former Bank of England policy maker
 Kate Barker  was named as a non-executive director at Electra
Private Equity Plc, a London-based buyout fund.  Barker will take up the role on Nov. 1, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Zurich-based bank Credit
Suisse Group AG said Sept. 30 she had been appointed as a senior
adviser in its fixed-income research division.  Barker stepped down from the central bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee in May after serving three consecutive three-year
terms on the panel. She was formerly an economist at the
Confederation of British Industry, the U.K.’s biggest business
lobby, and published reports for the former Labour government on
the housing market.  “I am delighted to welcome Kate Barker to the board of
Electra,”  Colette Bowe , chairman of Electra, said in the
statement. “She brings with her a wealth of economic and
political experience.”  Barker said on Sept. 23 that the case for the central bank
to inject more stimulus in the economy through its  bond-purchase
plan  is looking “less certain” as inflation holds above the
bank’s 2 percent target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
