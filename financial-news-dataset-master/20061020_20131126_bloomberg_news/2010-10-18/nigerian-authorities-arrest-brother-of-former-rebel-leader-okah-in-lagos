Nigerian  authorities arrested
Charles Okah, the brother of former Nigerian rebel leader  Henry Okah , and seized computer equipment, a family member said.  Security officials detained Charles Okah after raiding his
house in Lagos, the commercial capital, yesterday, Uche Okah,
his wife, said in a phone interview from the city. They didn’t
give reasons for his arrest, she said.  “I don’t know where my husband is,” Okah said.  Henry Okah, a former leader of the Movement for the
Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, is currently facing
trial in South Africa in connection with an Oct. 1 bombing
attack in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, in which 12 people died.
He has been charged with two counts of terrorism.  Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer. Attacks by MEND
cut more than 28 percent of the West African country’s crude
output between 2006 and 2009, according to Bloomberg data. While
the attacks decreased after thousands of fighters accepted a
government amnesty last year, MEND refused to disarm, saying its
demands were not met.  Henry Okah fears he may be poisoned while he is in prison
and is avoiding some of the food he is being served,  Radio 702 ,
a Johannesburg-based broadcaster, reported today, citing Okah.  Nigeria is the fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports.
Its low-sulphur sweet crude is favored by many U.S. refiners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
