U.S. stocks rose, led by financial
shares, after Citigroup Inc.’s earnings topped estimates and an
unexpected drop in industrial production added to signs the
Federal Reserve will buy more assets to fuel the economic
recovery.    The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.3 percent to
1,179.33 at 9:57 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average increased 46.25 points, or 0.4 percent, 11,109.03.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
