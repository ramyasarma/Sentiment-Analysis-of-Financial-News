Hewlett-Packard Co. is seeking a
court order to have shareholder lawsuits over former Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Hurd ’s separation agreement consolidated
into a single case in federal court.  The complaints share a common claim that Hewlett-Packard’s
directors wasted company money by awarding Hurd as much as
$53 million in severance when he resigned after an internal
investigation determined he violated business conduct standards
in trying to conceal a personal relationship with a marketing
contractor named  Jodie Fisher .  Lawyers for HP, Hurd and other individual defendants named
in the cases and two shareholder groups asked U.S. District
Judge  James Ware  in San Jose, California, today to group similar
suits into one case before him. A lawyer representing two other
shareholder groups today told Ware his cases are a “straight
shot” based on California law, and should therefore be
litigated separately.  Ware suspended pretrial information gathering in all the
cases until at least Nov. 1, when he scheduled arguments on the
request for consolidation.  The case is Levine v. Andreessen, 10-3608, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporters on this story:
