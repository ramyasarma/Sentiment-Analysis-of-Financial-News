Copper prices rose to the highest
level in 27 months as the dollar resumed a slide, boosting the
appeal of commodities as alternative assets.  The greenback erased an earlier advance against a basket of
major currencies on speculation that the Federal Reserve will
ease monetary policy further to help bolster the economy. Copper
reached $3.88 a pound, the highest price since July 2008.  “Copper is moving higher on the optimism about the
benefits of more quantitative easing,” said  Matthew Zeman , a
metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “The short-
dollar long-commodity trade is still a solid play.”  Copper futures for December delivery rose 1.6 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $3.855 at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal has gained 15 percent this year.  The Fed has kept its benchmark lending rate at zero percent
to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and purchased Treasuries and
mortgage-backed securities to revive the economy. Last week, Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said more quantitative easing is
warranted.  Copper for delivery in three months rose $43, or 0.5
percent, to $8,443 a metric ton ($3.83 a pound) on the London
Metal Exchange.  Aluminum, lead, and zinc also advanced on the LME. Nickel
and tin fell.  To contact the reporter on the story:
