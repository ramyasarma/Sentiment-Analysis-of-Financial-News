India’s rupee retreated from a two
year-high as refiners bought dollars to buy crude oil after a
decline in the price of the commodity.  The rupee fell for the first time in four days amid
speculation companies such as Indian Oil Corp. were buying oil.
India, Asia’s third-biggest economy, meets about three-quarters
of its oil needs from imports. State-owned Coal India Ltd. plans
to raise as much as 151.5 billion rupees ($3.4 billion) in the
nation’s biggest-ever initial public offering that opened today.  “Oil companies are buying,” said  Navin Raghuvanshi , a
Mumbai-based currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd.
“The only thing that can prevent the fall is the initial public
offering inflows.”  The rupee declined 0.6 percent to 44.3650 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency reached 43.96 on Oct. 15, its strongest
level since August 2008. The rupee has climbed 3.3 percent in
the past month.  The  Reserve Bank of India  may intervene to weaken the rupee
and protect exporters if the currency appreciates past 43
against the U.S. dollar, a finance ministry official with direct
knowledge of the matter said.  The government is comfortable with the rupee trading
between 43 and 45 to the U.S. currency, the official said late
on Oct. 15, asking not to be identified because the issue is
sensitive.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 44.74
at the end of last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  Funds based abroad have pumped $23.2 billion into India’s
stocks and $10.3 billion into its bonds so far in 2010,
according to exchange data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
