Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co. ,
Japan’s largest electric-furnace mill, cut prices for November
contracts from the previous month because of a stronger yen.  H-beams, used in construction, were cut to 67,000 yen ($824)
a metric ton from 72,000 yen in October, the Tokyo-based company
said at a briefing in today. Hot-rolled coil prices were cut to
59,000 yen a ton from 64,000 yen in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
