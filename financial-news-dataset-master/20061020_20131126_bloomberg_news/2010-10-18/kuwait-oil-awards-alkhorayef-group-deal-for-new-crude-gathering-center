Kuwait Oil Co., the state owned sole
domestic oil producer, signed a deal with Saudi Arabia’s
Alkhorayef Group to build a 100,000 barrel-a-day crude oil
gathering center, the official KUNA news agency reported today.  The agency did not give the value of the contract for the
plant which will be built in the western part of the Gulf Arab
state within two years. The center, the country’s 16th, will
process 75 million cubic feet of high pressure gas and 41
million cubic feet of low pressure gas a day, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
