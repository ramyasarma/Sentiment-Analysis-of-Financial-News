Gulf Finance House EC said it will
seek shareholders’ approval for an asset-swap transaction
between the Bahrain-based investment bank and its Chairman Esam
Janahi at a meeting on Oct. 31.  Janahi plans to transfer his entire holding, or 104.9
million shares, in Khaleeji Commercial Bank to Gulf Finance
House in return for the lender’s 100 percent equity interest in
Al Areen Leisure & Tourism SPC and $3 million either in cash or
through Gulf Finance House treasury shares, the Manama-based
company said in statement to the Bahrain bourse today.  The meeting will also seek shareholders approval for a
reverse share split of Gulf Finance House shares at a ratio of 4
to 1 and reduction of the paid-up capital to $145.8 million from
$625.8 million, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
