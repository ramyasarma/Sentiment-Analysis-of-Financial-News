Invest AD, an Abu Dhabi government-
owned money manager, is completing three transactions valued at
about $150 million in Turkey, Egypt and the United Arab
Emirates.  “The deals have a range of sectors - one is consumer
goods, the other is light-to-medium manufacturing business,”
the company’s head of private equity,  Samir Assaad , said in Abu
Dhabi today. Invest AD may close one deal by year end, he said.  Abu Dhabi’s government has pursued investments in real
estate, tourism and infrastructure as it seeks to diversify away
from an oil-based economy. The emirate’s non-oil businesses will
contribute 50 percent of its gross domestic product by 2015,
adding about $167 billion a year, as projected in its 22-year
economic plan.  Invest AD currently has a  stake  in Airport International
Group PSC, which is undertaking the rehabilitation, expansion
and operation of Queen Alia International Airport in Jordan. It
also has a majority shareholding in Industrial City Cooling
Company LLC, which owns and operates two district cooling plants
in Abu Dhabi’s Industrial City.  Invest AD aims to raise $400 million for a growth and
expansion capital fund for the Middle East, North Africa and
Turkey, Assaad said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
