Rescuers recovered the bodies of the
five remaining coal miners trapped by an underground gas blast
in Henan province, bringing the total death toll to 37 in
China’s deadliest mining disaster since June.  The bodies were found at 7.35 a.m. local time after about
300 rescuers pushed through 2,500 metric tons of coal dust at
the pit in central China, the State Administration of Work
Safety  said  on its website today.  China, the world’s biggest coal producer and consumer, has
the worst mine safety record, with an average of seven deaths
each day in accidents last year. The explosion at Pingyu city
follows a blast at Pingdingshan, also in Henan province, that
killed 48 workers.  The Oct. 16 Pingyu blast blocked 170 meters (186 yards) of
passageway, causing an accumulation of flammable gases that had
hindered rescue efforts, China National Radio said. A similar
incident in the same mine killed 23 people in August 2008, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Chilean President  Sebastian Pinera  had offered to help
China in the Pingyu accident, saying his country has learnt
lessons from its rescue of 33 miners trapped underground for
more than two months, Agence France-Presse reported on Oct. 16.  A total of 276 miners were in the pit when the incident
occurred, of whom 239 managed to escape immediately, the State
Administration of Work Safety said yesterday.  The Pingdingshan incident in June was the worst mining
disaster since more than 100 died in an explosion in the
northeastern province of Heilongjiang in November last year.  -- Chua Baizhen  and  Wang Ying . Editors:  Clyde Russell ,  Ryan Woo .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
