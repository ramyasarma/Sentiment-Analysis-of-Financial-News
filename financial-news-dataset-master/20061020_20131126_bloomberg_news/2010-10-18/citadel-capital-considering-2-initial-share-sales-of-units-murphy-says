Citadel Capital Corp. , a private
equity company based in Cairo, plans two initial public
offerings from its portfolio, Managing Director Stephen Murphy
told reporters in Abu Dhabi today.  Each IPO would raise between $175 million to $250 million
over the next two years, he said. “More liquidity is coming into
the market place; so we’ll take this opportunity with some of
the more mature companies in our portfolio to consider a
listing,” Murphy said.  Citadel would look at listing the companies in Egypt or on
“regional” stock markets, he said. The company holds
investments worth $8.3 billion in 14 countries.  Middle Eastern companies are joining a surge in emerging
market share sales to raise funds as regional stock markets
rebound and companies restructure their debt. Aluminium Bahrain
BSC, the operator of an 850,000-metric-ton-a-year smelter, plans
to raise as much as 204 million dinars ($541 million) from an
initial share sale from Oct. 24 to Nov. 4. Nawras, the Omani
mobile-phone company controlled by Qatar Telecom QSC, is in the
middle of a book-built IPO. Axiom Ltd., a unit of a Dubai-based
phone retailer, plans to sell a 35 percent stake in an IPO by
the end of the year.  Shares of Citadel advanced 0.5 percent to 7.64 Egyptian
pounds at 1:20 p.m. in Cairo, valuing the company at 5.05
billion pounds ($880 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
