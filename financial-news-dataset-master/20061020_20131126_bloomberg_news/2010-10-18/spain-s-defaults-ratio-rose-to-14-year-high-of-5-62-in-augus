Bad loans as a proportion of total
credit at Spanish lenders rose to 5.62 percent in August, a 14-
year high, from 5.47 percent in July as the country’s sluggish
economy slowed loan repayments.  Bad loans in the industry jumped to 102.5 billion euros
($142 billion) in August from 100.5 billion euros in July and
90.9 billion euros a year ago, the Bank of Spain said on its
 website  today. The bad loan ratio, which declined in June, was
4.94 percent a year earlier.  While some banks including  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria 
SA say their bad loans have peaked in Spain, others including
Banco Santander SA say that won’t happen until next year. The
country’s financial regulator says the industry’s “potentially
troubled exposure” to property developers includes another 123
billion euros in asset foreclosures and acquisitions, write-offs
and loans deemed to have a higher risk of default.  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending at commercial
banks climbed to 5.49 percent in August from 5.37 percent in
July, the central bank said. The bad loans ratio at savings
banks rose to 5.69 percent from 5.52 percent.  Banco Espanol de Credito SA, a Spanish retail banking unit
of Santander, said when it published earnings on Oct. 7 that its
bad loans ratio had climbed to 3.8 percent in September from
3.48 percent in June and 2.59 percent a year ago.  To contact the reporter for this story:
