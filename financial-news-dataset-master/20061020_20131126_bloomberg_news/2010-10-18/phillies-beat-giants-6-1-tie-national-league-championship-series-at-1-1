Jimmy Rollins drove in four runs as
the Philadelphia Phillies beat the San Francisco Giants 6-1 to
tie the National League Championship Series at one game each.   Rollins had a bases-loaded walk in the first inning and a
three-run double in the seventh, when the Phillies scored four
times to break open a 2-1 game at Citizens Bank Park in
Philadelphia. Roy Oswalt was the winning pitcher, allowing one
run over eight innings for the Phillies.  The best-of-seven series now moves to San Francisco for the
next three games. Game 3 is scheduled for Oct. 19.   The NLCS winner advances to the World Series to face the
New York Yankees or Texas Rangers. The Yankees and Rangers are
also tied 1-1 in the American League Championship Series with
Game 3 to be played Oct. 18 in New York.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
