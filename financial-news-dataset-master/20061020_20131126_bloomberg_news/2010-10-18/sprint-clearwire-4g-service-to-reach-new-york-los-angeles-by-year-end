Sprint Nextel Corp.  will introduce
fourth-generation wireless service in New York, Los Angeles and
San Francisco by year-end, pitting it against  Verizon Wireless 
in competing for customers on the higher-speed network.  Clearwire Corp. , which operates Sprint’s 4G network on a
technology known as WiMax, has expanded to 56 U.S. markets,
according to statements from the companies today. Verizon
Wireless said this month its 4G service, using an alternative
technology called LTE, will reach 38 markets this year.  Carriers are rolling out the 4G networks, which promise
average download speeds more than 5 times that of current 3G
technology, to draw data-hungry customers. Sprint charges a $10
monthly premium to users of its 4G network.  Kirkland, Washington-based Clearwire said today its 4G
network will fully cover the New York area by November 1, Los
Angeles by December 1 and San Francisco later that month.
Verizon Wireless didn’t provide specific introduction dates.  MetroPCS Communications Inc. introduced 4G service in Las
Vegas last month, making it the first to offer LTE commercially.
 AT&T Inc.  has said its LTE network will be available in next
year’s first quarter.  Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kansas, lost 2 cent to
$4.57 at 9:42 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
Clearwire declined 3 cents to $6.90 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
