The United Arab Emirates’ agreement
with Research In Motion Ltd. that averted a suspension of
BlackBerry smartphone services is “final,” Mohammed al-Ghanim,
director general of the country’s telecom regulator, told
reporters in Dubai today.  RIM’s accord announced on Oct. 8, which averted a ban
planned for Oct. 11, came after Saudi Arabia canceled a planned
shutdown of BlackBerry services and the Indian government said
it would push back a deadline to suspend BlackBerry services as
it works toward a solution.  Al-Ghanim declined to provide further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
