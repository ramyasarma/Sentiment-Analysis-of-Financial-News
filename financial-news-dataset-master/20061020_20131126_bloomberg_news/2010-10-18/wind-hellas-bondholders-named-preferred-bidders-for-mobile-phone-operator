Wind Hellas Telecommunications SA’s
senior bondholders were picked as preferred bidders for the
Greek mobile phone operator in the second time the cash-strapped
company has been sold in a year.  Wind Hellas’s senior secured floating-rate noteholders,
owed about 1.2 billion euros ($1.67 billion), will inject 420
million euros and write off debt in exchange for Greece’s third-
largest mobile phone operator, according to Wind’s parent
Weather Finance III Sarl, the holding company of Egyptian
billionaire  Naguib Sawiris .  Sawiris, who is selling some of his other telecoms assets
to Russia’s  Vimpelcom Ltd ., bought Wind Hellas out of bankruptcy
about a year ago. The company, under the control of creditors,
put itself up for sale a second time after deferring a 17.5
million-euro interest payment on a revolving credit in June and
missing a 23 million-euro payment on its floating-rate notes.  Under the bondholders’ proposal, Wind Hellas’s 250 million-
euro revolver will be repaid in full, while the company’s senior
secured notes and 355 million euros of subordinated bonds will
be written off, according to the statement.  The bondholder group includes Mount Kellett Capital
Partners (Ireland) Ltd., Taconic Capital Advisers UK LLP,
Providence Equity Capital Markets LLC, Anchorage Capital Group
LLC, Angelo Gordon & Co and Eton Park International LLP,
according to the statement.  Sawiris didn’t immediately respond to a call for comment.
 Louise Tingstrom , an external spokeswoman for Wind Hellas in
London, declined to comment further on the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
