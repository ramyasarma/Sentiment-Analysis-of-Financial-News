Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC , the
United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest bank complying with shariah
banking rules, posted a 31 percent increase in third-quarter
profit as income from fees and commissions soared.  Net income rose to 314.5 million dirhams ($85.6 million)
from 239.5 million dirhams in the year-earlier period, the bank
said in an e-mailed statement today. Fees and commission income
rose 77 percent to 118.2 million dirhams, while earnings from
financing operations advanced 26 percent to 669 million dirhams.  “While the brunt of the legacy portfolio’s cost of credit
was absorbed in 2009 we will continue to take prudent measures,
including further credit provisions and impairments, in line
with the relevant policies and developments,” Chief Executive
Officer  Tirad Mahmoud  said in the statement. The bank’s third-
quarter provisions rose 36 percent to 165.6 million dirhams from
the year-earlier period.  U.A.E. banks are recovering after the worst financial
crisis since the 1930s forced banks to curb lending and take
heavy provisions. The nation’s economy may grow between 3
percent and 4 percent next year, compared with a government
forecast of 3.2 percent for 2010, U.A.E. central bank Governor
 Sultan bin Nasser al-Suwaidi  said Oct. 13.  Abu Dhabi Islamic will hold non-equity investor meetings in
Asia, Europe and the Middle East from Oct. 20, the bank said
today. The lender hired HSBC Holdings Plc, Standard Chartered
Plc and Barclays Plc to help sell bonds, two bankers familiar
with the plan said last week.  Abu Dhabi Islamic  shares  increased 0.3 percent to 3.06
dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate today. The shares
have advanced 27 percent this year compared with the 1.3 percent
gain in the benchmark  ADX General Index .  To contact the reporters on this story:
