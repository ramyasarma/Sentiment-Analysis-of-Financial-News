Pike River Coal Co. , which mines on
New Zealand’s South Island, fell by the most in two years in
Wellington after it slashed its full-year production forecast
by at least 42 percent.  The mine will produce between 320,000 tons and 360,000 tons
of coal in the year ending June 30, down from an April forecast
of 620,000 tons, the company said in a statement. The stock
slumped 11 percent, its biggest drop since Oct. 16, 2008.  Pike River, which mines near Greymouth, is part-owned by
India’s Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd. and Saurashtra Fuels Pvt., which
are also contracted to take part of its low-ash, low-phosphorus
coking coal. The venture deferred its first shipment three times
last year and began exporting in February.  “Slower roadway development to date and lower forecast
development in the next few months ahead of the introduction of
the second ABM20 continuous mining machine and an upgrade to one
of the current machines, will result in some interruptions to
production in the new year,” the company said.  High production forecast for May and June next year will
now occur in the 2011-2012 period, it said.  The  stock  fell 13 cents to NZ$1.05 at the 5 p.m. market
close in Wellington. Before today the stock had gained 26
percent the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
