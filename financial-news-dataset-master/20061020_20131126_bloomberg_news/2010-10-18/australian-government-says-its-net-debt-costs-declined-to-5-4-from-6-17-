The Australian government’s net
funding costs declined to 5.4 percent in the 12 months ended
June 30, from 6.17 percent a year earlier, the Australian Office
of Financial Management said today in its annual report.  The figures exclude the one-off benefits from the
termination of interest-rate swaps in the year-ago period, it
said. Payments on debt totaled A$6.3 billion for a gross cost of
funds equivalent to 5.05 percent, the AOFM said. Swaps added
A$969 million to revenue in the financial year ended June 30,
2009, compared with a A$41 million contribution in the 2010
financial year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
