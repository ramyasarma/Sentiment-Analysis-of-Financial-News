New York University Professor
Nouriel Roubini said Germany’s austerity measures, introduced to
fight the aftermath of the financial crisis, are “fatal” for
Europe’s largest economy, Capital magazine reported, citing an
interview.  Chancellor Angela Merkel should take advantage of Germany’s
ability to borrow money cheaply and “should only start to
consolidate when the rest of Europe is in better shape,”
Roubini is cited as saying.  He said Germany’s strong economic growth “looks good on
paper but is primarily driven by statistical effects,” Roubini
said, according to the magazine.  Roubini also said “the slightest external shock suffices”
to derail Greece’s efforts to fix its budget deficit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
