Corn futures dropped for a fourth
day as investors liquidated long positions, or bets that prices
will rise, on speculation a stronger dollar will curb demand for
inventories from the U.S., the biggest producer and shipper.  Corn gained 16 percent in the three sessions before the
current slide after the U.S. Department of Agriculture released
a report showing output would fall 3.4 percent from the prior
year, more than expected by analysts. The dollar has gained 1
percent in the past two sessions against a basket of six
currencies as German investor confidence nears a 21-month low.  “The correction seems to be natural, and with the U.S.
dollar slightly coming back, we can test the resistance of the
market fundamentals,” said Jonathan Bouchet, a Geneva-based
trader at OTCex Group, in an e-mail.  Corn for December delivery fell 2.25 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $5.6075 a bushel at 12:24 p.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Futures surged to $5.88 a bushel on Oct. 13, the
highest price for a most-active contract since Aug. 29, 2008.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators trimmed for
a second week their net-long positions, or the difference
between bets on price gains and wagers on declines, in Chicago
corn futures in the week ended Oct. 12, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  “Market participants  took  profits on previous positions
after pushing futures to the highest level in more than two
years earlier,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte., said in a report e-mailed today.  Net-long  positions in corn declined 2.6 percent to 432,737
contracts in Chicago, according to trading commission data.  Wheat Declines  U.S. farmers sold 906,029 metric tons in the week ended
Oct. 7, taking total outstanding sales and accumulated exports
to 18.97 million tons, the nation’s Department of Agriculture
said Oct. 15. Traders surveyed by Bloomberg News expected sales
for the week to rise to as much as 2 million tons.  Wheat for December delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $7.0325 a bushel.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a  net-long  position to a net-short position in Chicago
wheat futures in the week ended Oct. 12. Speculative short
positions, or bets prices will fall, outnumbered long positions
by 3,592 contracts in Chicago, the Washington-based trading
commission said in its Commitments of Traders report. The
previous week, traders were net-long 4,008 contracts.  Soybeans for January delivery were little changed at $11.95
a bushel. U.S. exporters sold 518,803 tons to China and unknown
buyers for delivery in the year that began Sept. 1, the USDA
said Oct. 15. Sales in the week ended Oct. 7 rose 17 percent
from a week earlier to 1.109 million tons, including 53 percent
to China, the biggest consumer.  Rice Gains  Rough-rice for November delivery advanced for a fifth
consecutive day today, gaining 5.5 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$13.68 per 100 pounds in Chicago.  The Philippines, the world’s biggest rice buyer, may lose
600,000 tons of the crop as Supertyphoon Megi, the strongest to
hit the nation this year, strikes some of the nation’s biggest
producing areas, Agriculture Undersecretary Antonio Fleta said
in a phone interview today.  Potential losses may boost the Philippines’ import needs by
500,000 tons, pushing prices higher in Chicago and Thailand,
 Chookiat Ophaswongse , former president of the Thai Rice
Exporters Association, said from Bangkok.  “I think it may have some effect, even on U.S. rice
prices,” said Chookiat, who advises the export group. Thai rice
prices may rise by as much as $20 a ton, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
