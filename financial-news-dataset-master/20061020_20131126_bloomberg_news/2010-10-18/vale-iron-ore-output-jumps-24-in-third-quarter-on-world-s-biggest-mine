Vale SA , the world’s biggest iron-
ore producer, boosted third-quarter output 24 percent because of
rising demand and higher output at its largest mine.  Rio de Janeiro-based Vale produced 82.6 million tons of the
steelmaking raw material in the three months through Sept. 30,
the highest since record output of 85.8 million tons in the
third quarter of 2008, Vale said today in a regulatory filing.  The company is boosting capacity at Carajas, the world’s
biggest iron ore mine, and seeking to begin production at
Simandou in Guinea by the end of 2012 as steelmaking demand
rebounds. Vale also said that it plans to expand production of
non-ferrous minerals such as nickel, copper and fertilizers.  “An improvement in the operational performance of current
assets and the starting of new projects in a context of growing
global demand for minerals, metals and fertilizers are helping
to strengthen our financial position,” Vale said.  Carajas’s output rose 21 percent to a record 27 million
tons in the third quarter after the end of some operational
problems in the port terminal of Ponta da Madeira, Vale said. An
improvement in the performance of the Estrada de Ferro Carajas
railway and the end of the rainy season in the Amazon also
contributed to the increase, the company said in the filing.  Vale senior executives are hosting a  meeting  with investors
in New York today from 10 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
