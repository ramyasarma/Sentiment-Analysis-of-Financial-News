Emirates Integrated
Telecommunications Co. , the Dubai-based phone company known as
Du, jumped to the highest since December after Chief Executive
Officer,  Osman Sultan , said earnings will continue to grow.  The shares climbed  as much as  3.7 percent to 3.06 dirhams,
the highest level since Dec. 15, and traded at 3.05 dirhams at
10:50 a.m. in the emirate.  “If we’re talking compared to last year, Du is a good
growth story and will continue to grow” with respect to
earnings, Sultan said in Dubai yesterday.  Profit at the company known as Du more than doubled in the
second quarter from a year-earlier as its client base grew. Du
may this week announce a 57 percent increase in third-quarter
earnings to 123 million dirhams ($33.5 million) according to the
mean estimate of two analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
