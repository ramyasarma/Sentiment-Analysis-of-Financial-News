Ted Menzies, Canadian Finance
Minister Jim Flaherty’s main spokesman in Parliament, said the
opposition Liberal Party’s call to freeze corporate tax rates at
current levels would hurt the recovery.  Menzies made the comments to reporters today in Ottawa. The
plan would have “serious negative consequences,” the
Conservative lawmaker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
