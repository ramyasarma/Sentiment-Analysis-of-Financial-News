Amcor Ltd. , Australia’s biggest
packaging company, is seeking $1.6 billion of new revolving
loans to refinance existing debt, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  The Melbourne-based company hired National Australia Bank
Ltd., Westpac Banking Corp., Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. to help it arrange the facility, which will
include terms of two, three and four years, the person said,
asking not to be named as the talks are private.  Amcor, whose  biggest market  is North America, completed its
$2.03 billion purchase of Rio Tinto Group’s Alcan unit in
February to become the world’s largest supplier of packaging to
the pharmaceutical, healthcare and personal care industries,
according to Deutsche Bank AG. Its  shares  have gained 18 percent
in the past 12 months, compared with a 2.6 percent decline for
the S&P/ASX 200 Index.  The company has a $1.25 billion revolving facility due in
June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company will
be able to draw its new loans in euros, pounds and U.S.,
Australian and Canadian dollars, the person said.  In a revolving facility, money that’s been repaid can be
borrowed again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
