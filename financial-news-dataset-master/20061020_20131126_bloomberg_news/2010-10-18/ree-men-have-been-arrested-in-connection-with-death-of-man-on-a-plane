Three men have been arrested in
connection with the death of Jimmy Mubenga, who was being
deported from the U.K. and died after becoming unwell on a
 British Airways Plc  flight preparing to depart from London’s
Heathrow Airport on Oct. 12.  Mubenga, 46, who was being deported to Angola, was escorted
by civilian security guards, London’s Metropolitan Police said
in an e-mailed statement. The guards worked for G4S Plc, the
U.K. security company, the Guardian  reported  last week.  “Three of our employees are continuing to help the police
with their investigation,” a spokesman for  G4S  said in an e-
mailed statement.  A post-mortem examination was inconclusive and further
tests will be carried out to establish the cause of death, which
is being treated as unexplained at this stage, the police said.
The three men have been released on bail.  “It’s a matter for the police,” British Airways
spokeswoman Helena Flynn said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
