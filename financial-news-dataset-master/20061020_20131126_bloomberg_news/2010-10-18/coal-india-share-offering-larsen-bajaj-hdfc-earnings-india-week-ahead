Coal India Ltd.  plans to sell as
much as 151.5 billion rupees ($3.4 billion) of stock in the
country’s biggest initial share sale starting today, likely
setting the direction for the equity market this week.  Shares of the world’s top coal producer will be sold in a
range of 225 rupees to 245 rupees each. Fifteen of 18 investors
surveyed by Bloomberg News said they plan to bid for shares. The
sale concludes Oct. 21.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government plans to sell
shares in state-run companies to raise 400 billion rupees this
year to trim a budget deficit. The sale of a 10 percent stake in
the coal miner will help meet about 38 percent of the target and
may exceed 116 billion rupees raised by billionaire  Anil Ambani ’s  Reliance Power Ltd.  in January 2008.  Indian companies have raised a record 806 billion rupees in
equity and rights offerings this year, according to data on the
Bloomberg. The country’s benchmark Sensitive Index has advanced
15 percent so far in 2010, making it the best performing gauge
among the world’s 10 largest stock markets. The  index  lost 0.6
percent last week, declining for the second week, as the central
bank indicated it may intervene to limit currency gains, which
spurred concern it will slow record foreign fund inflows.  The rupee completed a seventh weekly advance, strengthening
0.8 percent to 44.10 per dollar in the five days to Oct. 15.
Ten-year  bonds  dropped for a third week, with yields climbing to
a seven-week high. The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May
2020 increased eight basis points to 8.07 percent last week.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. ,  Bajaj Auto Ltd.  and  Housing
Development Finance Corp.  are among companies announcing
earnings. Infosys Technologies Ltd. last week posted profit that
beat analysts’ estimates and increased its earnings forecasts as
a reviving world economy lifts demand for services.
