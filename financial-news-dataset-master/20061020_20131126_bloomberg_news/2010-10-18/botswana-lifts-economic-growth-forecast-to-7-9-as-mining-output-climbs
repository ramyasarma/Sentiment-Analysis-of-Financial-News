     Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) --Botswana’s government raised its
economic growth forecast for this year to 7.9 percent because of
an increase in mining production, said Taufila Nyamadzabo,
secretary for economic and financial policy at the finance
ministry.  The forecast was increased from 5 percent, Nyamadzabo said
in a phone interview from the capital Gaborone today, citing a
budget strategy document. The budget deficit for the year
through March 2010 was 9.3 billion pula, lower than a previous
forecast of 13.4 billion pula, he said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
