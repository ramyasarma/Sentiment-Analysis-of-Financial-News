The odds of a China property tax
have risen to above 50 percent while trade protectionism has
become likely, according to Morgan Stanley.  “The Special Real Estate tax could be a variant of the
current Real Estate Tax, its likelihood of being implemented
has increased significantly to ‘‘almost could happen’’ zone
(i.e., above 50%),” according to a Morgan Stanley report.
“The probability of trade protectionism rises by one notch from
probable (30-40%) to likely (40-50%).”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
