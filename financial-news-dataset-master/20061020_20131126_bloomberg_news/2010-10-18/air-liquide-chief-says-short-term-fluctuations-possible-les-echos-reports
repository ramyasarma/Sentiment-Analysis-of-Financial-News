Air Liquide SA Chief Executive
Officer Benoit Potier told Les Echos in an interview that the
crisis is not completely over and that short-term fluctuations
are still possible.  “The horizon seems clear in three to four years but in the
short term there could still be fluctuations. A month with a
sales drop of 3 percent or 4 percent isn’t impossible, even if I
don’t believe that the economy will have another sharp
relapse,” Potier told the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
