Dangote Cement, Nigeria’s biggest
manufacturer of the building material, will begin trading on the
Nigerian Stock Exchange on Oct. 26, said Afrinvest (West Africa)
Ltd., which is handling the sale of the company’s stock.  The company will sell 100 million shares “or such further
volume as the market may demand” at 135 naira each and these
will be traded on the Lagos-based bourse on the same day,
Afrinvest said in a statement in the Punch newspaper today. The
listing will be by introduction and won’t involve the sale of
new shares, it said.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange last month said it approved a
22.09 trillion-naira ($14 billion) listing of Dangote shares,
which will increase the bourse’s market value by 37 percent. A
total of 15.5 billion shares for the company will be listed at
135 naira each, the exchange said.  “We intend to put all our cement assets in one entity,”
Chief Operating Officer Kunle Alake said in an interview on
Johannesburg-based CNBC Africa today. “That is what we have
done with Dangote Cement.”  The Nigerian Stock Exchange suspended trade in  Benue Cement
Plc’s  shares after a court sanctioned its merger with Dangote
Cement on Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
