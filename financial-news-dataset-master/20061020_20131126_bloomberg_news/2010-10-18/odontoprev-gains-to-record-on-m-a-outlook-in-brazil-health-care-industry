Odontoprev SA , Brazil’s largest
provider of dental-care plans, rose to a record in Sao Paulo on
speculation mergers and acquisitions will imply higher value for
assets in the industry.  The stock gained 3.6 percent to 24.42 reais at 11:08 a.m.
New York time and earlier jumped as much as 9.9 percent, the
most intraday in two months. Odontoprev has advanced 15 percent
since Oct. 8.  Tempo Participacoes SA, a health-insurance company, said
Oct. 15 it’s seeking business opportunities or a possible sale.
Tempo was responding to a report in Valor Economico newspaper
that the company is seeking a buyer for about 900 million reais
($541.3 million).  “There’s speculation on Tempo,” said  Marcelo Varejao , an
analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage Socopa Corretora. “The
eventual premium paid for Tempo will help price the industry.”  Odontoprev Chief Executive Officer  Randal Zanetti  said Aug.
19 he sees “consolidation possibilities” in Brazilian health
care. The company agreed in August to form a dental-care company
with lenders  Banco do Brasil SA  and  Banco Bradesco SA .  Diagnosticos da America SA , the medical-diagnostics firm
known as Dasa, fell 2.2 percent to 19.91 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
