Brazil’s government may announce
measures this week to reduce leverage positions by companies,
banks and investors in derivatives contracts, Valor Economico
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  The government may order  BM&FBovespa SA  to double or triple
the margin requirements on futures contracts, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said. In the past two weeks, Brazilian
government officials have discussed ways to discourage
transactions that they consider speculative and that are
contributing to the real’s appreciation against the dollar,
Valor said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
