The  dollar  erased its increase
versus a basket of currencies including the euro and yen as an
advance in stocks on the prospect of more easing by the Federal
Reserve revived demand for assets related to economic growth.  The yen rose against most of its major counterparts on bets
Japan will refrain from intervening to weaken its currency
before this week’s meeting of policy makers from Group of 20
nations. The Canadian dollar fell against the greenback on
speculation the Bank of Canada will refrain from increasing the
1 percent target lending rate tomorrow.  “The dollar in general has given up a bunch of its
overnight gains across the board and against the euro on a
reversal in risk sentiment,” said  John Doyle , a strategist in
Washington at the currency-trading firm Tempus Consulting Inc.
“We still have quantitative easing. That’s going to continue to
weigh on the dollar.”  The U.S. currency traded at $1.3979 per euro at 4:15 p.m.
in New York, compared with $1.3977 on Oct. 15, when it reached
$1.4159, the weakest level since Jan. 26. The euro slid 0.20
percent to 113.62 yen, from 113.88, after touching 112.41, the
lowest level since Sept. 24. The yen gained 0.3 percent to 81.21
per dollar, from 81.45. It touched 80.88 on Oct. 15, the
strongest level since April 1995.  Stocks gained, pushing the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  up
0.7 percent. Crude oil for November delivery rose 2.4 percent to
$83.20 a barrel.  ‘Stocks and Oil’  “The move today to U.S. dollar weakness seems to be a
correlated move with stocks and oil,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , a
currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.]  The Australian dollar was near its strongest level since
exchange controls were removed in 1983 as gold traded near a
record. The Aussie gained 0.3 percent to 99.39 U.S. cents after
rising to parity for the first time on Oct. 15.  Canada’s dollar slid as all 18 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey predicted that the Bank of Canada will leave the
target lending rate at 1 percent.  The loonie dropped as much as 1.2 percent to C$1.0228 per
U.S. dollar, matching an intraday decline on Sept. 7. It touched
a level stronger than parity on Oct. 14.  Brazil’s real slid 0.5 percent to 1.6740 versus the dollar
after the central bank president,  Henrique Meirelles , told
reporters that the government is considering new measures to
stem the currency’s rally.  ‘Currency War’  Developing countries are intervening in currency markets to
protect their economies against massive inflows of dollars in
what Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  has called a
“currency war.” The real has appreciated 4.3 percent against
the dollar this year.  The Dollar Index, used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and pound, fell less than 0.1 percent to 76.997 after earlier
advancing 0.8 percent. It touched 76.144 on Oct. 15, the lowest
level since Dec. 11.  The gauge of the greenback has dropped 4.3 percent since
Sept. 21, when the Fed said in a statement following its policy
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed” to support the recovery.  Futures  traders decreased their bets that the euro will
gain against the dollar in the week through Oct. 12, figures
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed Oct. 15. The difference in the number of wagers by
hedge funds and other large speculators on an advance in the
euro compared with those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was
41,511, compared with 48,243 a week earlier, the highest amount
since October 2009.  ‘Built Significantly’  “The short dollar positions have been built significantly
over the past weeks,” said  Robert Lynch , head of currency
strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York. “Given the
lopsidedness in the positions and the fact that it seems the
market is now more fully pricing in the possibility for some
level of quantitative easing from the Fed, the idea that that’s
going to take the dollar even lower may be losing some of its
appeal.”  The yen remained stronger than 82.88 per dollar, where it
traded on Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged selling the currency
to help its export-dependent economy.  Japan’s currency has gained 84 percent against a basket of
the most-traded currencies since the start of 1986, including a
13 percent gain in 2010. The nation posted a surplus every year
in its current account, the broadest measure of trade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
