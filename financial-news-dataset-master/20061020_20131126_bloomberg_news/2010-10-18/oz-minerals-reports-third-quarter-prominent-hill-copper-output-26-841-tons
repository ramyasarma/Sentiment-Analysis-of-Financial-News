OZ Minerals Ltd. , an Australian
copper and gold mining company, said annual gold production will
beat its forecast by 10 percent after third-quarter output more
than doubled.  Production of the precious metal climbed to 51,451 ounces
in the three months ended Sept. 31 from 21,091 ounces last year,
as it mined “softer” ore, Melbourne-based OZ Minerals said
today in a statement. Output at its Prominent Hill mine will be
greater than 185,000 ounces this year, the company said.  Copper production dropped 5 percent to 26,841 metric tons
and is likely to meet its full-year forecast of 100,000 tons to
110,000 tons, the company said.  OZ Minerals, with a  cash  balance of $1.43 billion as of
June 30 according to Bloomberg data, has said it wants to add
more copper assets to create a second source of production.
Supply constraints will keep the copper market in deficit “for
the time being,”  Malcolm Southwood , an analyst at Goldman Sachs
& Partners Australia Pty. said in an Oct. 15 report.  Shareholders “are happy” for the company to retain some
of the funds for any acquisitions or project development, Chief
Executive Officer  Terry Burgess  said during a media call. “The
question is really how much of the cash we need to retain.”  OZ Minerals  fell 0.3 percent to close at A$1.59 at 4:10 p.m.
Sydney time on the Australian stock exchange. OZ Minerals has
risen 35 percent this year.  The company in July bought a 19 percent stake in Sandfire
Resources NL for A$100 million, and on July 15 approved a A$135
million underground development at Prominent Hill.  Copper production may average 100,000 tons to 110,000
metric tons and gold output 185,000 ounces for the next few
years, giving the company a revenue stream of 15 percent to 20
percent from gold by-product, said Burgess.  To contact the reporter on this story:
