Fluor Corp., the largest publicly
traded construction and engineering company in the U.S., fell
the most in five months in New York trading after taking a
third-quarter charge because of delays on a wind-farm project
and cutting its 2010 forecast.  Cost increases  for its offshore wind project in the U.K.
will lead to a charge of 90 cents a share following problems
with material and equipment delivery, Fluor said in a statement
today. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted third-
quarter profit of 72 cents, the average of 21  estimates .  Fluor, based in Irving, Texas, said it has taken steps to
counter additional costs and delays. The company has a $1.8
billion contract to build a wind farm 25 kilometers (16 miles)
off the east coast of the U.K. The project will probably be
completed in 2012, according to the statement.  The company reduced its 2010 earnings-per-share estimate to
$2.20 to $2.50 from an earlier  prediction  of as much as $3.20.
Fluor will forecast 2011 profit during its third-quarter
earnings call on Nov. 4, according to the statement.  Fluor dropped $3.16, or 6.1 percent, to $48.71 at 9:34 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after touching
$48.10 for the steepest intraday  decline  since May 7. The shares
had climbed 15 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
