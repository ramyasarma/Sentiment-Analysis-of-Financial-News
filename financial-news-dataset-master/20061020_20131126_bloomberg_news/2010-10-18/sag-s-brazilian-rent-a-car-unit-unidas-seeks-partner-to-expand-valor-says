SGPS SA ’s Brazilian rent-a-car unit, Unidas, is seeking a
partner to help the company to expand and refinance its 535
million reais ($321.3 million) net debt, Valor Economico said,
citing Unidas’s chief executive officer.  Unidas is seeking a minority shareholder to help the
company to expand between 25 percent and 30 percent in Brazil in
the next three to four years, CEO  Pedro Almeida  told the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper. The company wants to take advantage of an
expected increase in demand for car rental with 2014 World Cup
and the Olympics Games in 2016, Valor said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
