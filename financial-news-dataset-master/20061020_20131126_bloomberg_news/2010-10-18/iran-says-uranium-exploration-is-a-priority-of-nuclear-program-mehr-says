Iran has made uranium exploration a
priority of its nuclear program, the state-run Mehr news agency
reported, citing Vice-President  Ali Akbar Salehi , who heads the
Persian Gulf country’s Atomic Energy Organization.  “The activities have grown several-fold,” Salehi said.
Most exploration is being carried out in central and southern
Iran, according to  Mehr . Salehi declined to comment on the
results of the program, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
