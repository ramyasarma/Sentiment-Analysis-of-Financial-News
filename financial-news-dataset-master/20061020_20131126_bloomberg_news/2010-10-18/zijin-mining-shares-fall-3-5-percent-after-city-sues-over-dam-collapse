Zijin Mining Group Co. , China’s
biggest gold producer, fell the most in 11 months in Shanghai
trading after the company said it faces legal claims in
connection with a fatal dam collapse at a tin mine.  Shares  fell as much as 7.3 percent to 9.52 yuan, the
biggest drop since Nov. 27, 2009, and traded at 9.60 yuan at
10:12 a.m. local time, in Shanghai. The Shanghai  benchmark index 
fell 0.9 percent. In Hong Kong, the  stock  dropped 3.6 percent.  Two subsidiaries are being sued by the Xinyi city
government for at least 19.5 million yuan ($2.9 million), a
Guangdong court notified, according to a  statement  on Oct. 17
from the gold miner.  Zijin said on Sept. 27 four people died after a dam at its
mine collapsed and the Guangdong government is investigating.
Tang Tao, a spokesman of the Guangdong government, said that 28
people were dead or missing after the accident, and an initial
investigation showed “serious quality problems” with Zijin’s
tailing dam.  The accident would lead to a loss of 19 million yuan, Zijin
said on Sept. 27. The tin mine was in trial production, it said.  Separately, Zijin had been fined 9.6 million yuan for the
July acid-waste spill that poisoned almost 2,000 metric tons of
fish, the company said on Oct. 7. The company spilled 2.4
million ton of gallons of acidic waste from its Zijinshan copper
mine in Fujian province, polluting the Ting river.  Chairman  Chen Jinghe  will have to focus on cleaning up and
expansion plans may be delayed after the accidents, according to
UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. Zijin posted a  profit  of 3.6 billion yuan in
2009 after gold and copper prices rose.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
