The German government is examining
the bid by Spain’s Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA
for German builder Hochtief AG, though it doesn’t currently plan
to alter its takeover regulations or to use its resources to
stop the bid, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.   Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government takes the ACS offer
“very seriously” and doesn’t want Hochtief to be broken up or
moved away from its headquarters in the western German city of
Essen, Seibert told journalists today in Berlin.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
