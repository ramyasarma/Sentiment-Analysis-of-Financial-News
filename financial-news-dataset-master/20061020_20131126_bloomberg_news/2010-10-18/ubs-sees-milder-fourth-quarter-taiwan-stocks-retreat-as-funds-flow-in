A pullback in Taiwan stocks this
quarter will be “milder” than expected given increased
liquidity, according to UBS AG, Switzerland’s biggest bank.  The brokerage raised its yearend forecast for the benchmark
 Taiex index  to 7,600 from 7,200 and lifted its end-2011 target
to 8,650 from 8,600, according to a report by  William Dong . The
 Taiex  slid 1.4 percent to 8,093.58 at 11:03 a.m.  “A low interest rate environment, a rise in net capital
inflow and efforts to resist Taiwan dollar appreciation have led
to a rise in liquidity, which is finding its way into the equity
market, led by retail investors,” said Dong, head of the UBS
Taiwan research team that was ranked second on the island by
Institutional Investor this year.  The Taiex has retreated 1.1 percent this year, after
jumping 78 percent in 2009 as Taiwan’s President  Ma Ying-jeou 
helped cement closer ties with China by abandoning his
predecessor’s pro-independence stance.  The Taiwan dollar has risen 3.9 percent this year. Central
bank Governor  Perng Fai-nan  and his board increased the
benchmark interest rate by 0.125 percentage point to 1.5 percent
on Sept. 30, following a similar advance in June from a record-
low 1.25 percent. Taiwan has no plans to impose a tax on inflows
of “hot money,” Deputy Finance Minister  Chang Sheng-ford  said
on Oct. 14, referring to short-term speculative capital.  Second-Half 2011  The brokerage expects further progress on cross-strait
relations in the second half of next year, such as the opening
of individual travel for Chinese tourists prior to the
presidential election in 2012.  “We believe these initiatives could trigger positive
retail sentiment and channel excess liquidity into the equity
market in the second half of 2011,” said Dong.  Chinese visitors to Taiwan may exceed 1.2 million in 2010,
against 972,123 in all of 2009, according to Yuan Kai-zhi, an
official at the tourism bureau’s international division in
Taipei. The figure may for the first time surpass travelers from
Japan, forecast at 1.13 million this year, Yuan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
