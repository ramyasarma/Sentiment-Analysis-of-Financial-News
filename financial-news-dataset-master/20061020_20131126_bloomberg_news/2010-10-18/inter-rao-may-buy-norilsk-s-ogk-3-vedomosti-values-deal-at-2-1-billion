OAO Inter RAO UES, the Russian
utility chaired by Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin , said it’s
seeking to buy OAO OGK-3 from OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel for shares.  Inter RAO wants to acquire all of Norilsk’s 83 percent
stake in OGK-3, said Ekaterina Dobrogorskaya, a spokeswoman for
Inter RAO, by telephone in Moscow.  Norilsk may get 15 percent of Inter RAO in the deal, which
values 83 percent of OGK-3 at $2.1 billion, the Vedomosti
newspaper reported earlier today, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.  Norilsk’s ownership of OGK-3 has been part of a dispute
between rival Norilsk shareholders United Co. Rusal, controlled
by  Oleg Deripaska , and  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding Co.
 Maria Uvarova , a spokeswoman for Norilsk, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
