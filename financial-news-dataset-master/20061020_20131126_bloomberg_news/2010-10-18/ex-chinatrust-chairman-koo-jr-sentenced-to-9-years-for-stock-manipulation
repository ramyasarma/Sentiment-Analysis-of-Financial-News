Chinatrust Financial Holding Co.’s 
former vice chairman  Jeffrey Koo Jr.  was sentenced to nine years
in prison for manipulating shares of a rival during an attempted
takeover, a Taiwan court said.  Koo’s actions drove down the price of  Mega Financial
Holding Co.  shares during Chinatrust’s bid for the company in
2005 and 2006, the Taipei District Court said in a statement
announcing his conviction and sentencing today.  Chinatrust manipulated the share price using structured
notes in its attempt to combine with Mega to create Taiwan’s
second-largest financial group by market value, today’s verdict
said. Koo, whose father is Taiwan’s 26th richest man according
to Forbes magazine, resigned from Chinatrust in November 2006.  Vanney Cho, a spokesman for Chinatrust Financial, declined
to comment when reached by phone today. Koo, who denied the
charges during the trial according to the Central News Agency,
couldn’t be reached for comment, Cho said.  Chinatrust Financial fell 0.5 percent to NT$20.25 in Taipei
trading as of the 1:30 p.m. close.  Mega Financial  declined 3
percent to NT$20.95 and the benchmark Taiex dropped 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
