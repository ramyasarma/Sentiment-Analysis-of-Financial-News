Heavy rain in Queensland may cause
“sporadic delays” to coal exports in the coming months, which
will result in congestion at ports on Australia’s east coast,
Commodore Research & Consultancy said.  This may “force buyers to import more coal from less
proximate exporters including South Africa, Colombia, and the
United States,” Commodore said in an e-mailed note today. The
Australian state had its wettest September in 100 years, UBS AG
said Oct. 7, citing the Bureau of Meteorology.  Queensland, which produces 95 percent of the nation’s sugar
and is the country’s largest coal exporter, may get more
tropical storms than average this season because of the La Nina
weather pattern, the bureau said Oct. 4. The state’s cyclone
season extends from November to April. Further rainfall may
crimp output of the commodity used in steel making and to fuel
power plants, driving prices higher, UBS said.  La Nina occurs every three to five years and can last nine
to 12 months, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. The weather event can disrupt farm
output in Asia and intensify hurricane development in the
Atlantic Ocean. Australia is the world’s largest shipper of coal
and the third-biggest exporter of sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
