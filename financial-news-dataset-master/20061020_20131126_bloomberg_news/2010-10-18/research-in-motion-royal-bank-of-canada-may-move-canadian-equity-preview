Canadian stocks  fell as gold
producers declined after China unexpectedly raised lending rates
and the Bank of Canada said it would stop raising interest rates
amid a weakening economy.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
Kinross Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc. fell at least 2 percent as
China increased its lending and deposit rates after inflation
accelerated, curbing demand for the metal as an alternative
investment. Research In Motion Ltd. dropped 1.3 percent after
Apple Inc. reported profit that fell short of analysts’
estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  slipped 102.20
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,565.81 as of 10:08 a.m. in
Toronto.  The materials group dropped 2.3 percent, the most since
July 27 as mining companies accounted for the 10 worst
performing members of the benchmark index. Gold companies make
up 11 percent of Canadian stocks by market value, according to
Bloomberg data. The S&P/TSX has gained  five straight weeks , the
longest streak since April 2009, as gold surged to a record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
