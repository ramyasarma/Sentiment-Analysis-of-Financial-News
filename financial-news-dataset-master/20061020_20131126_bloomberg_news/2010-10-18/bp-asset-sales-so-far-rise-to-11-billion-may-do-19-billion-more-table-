BP Plc’s  asset sales to raise cash
to pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill rose to more than $11
billion, and the disposal of other fields slated for sale may
net the company about $19 billion more.  BP said in July it would raise between $25 billion and $30
billion over 18 months from selling oil and gas production
assets outside key regions for growth. Today, it announced the
sale of $1.8 billion of fields in Vietnam and Venezuela to its
Russian joint venture TNK-BP.  TNK-BP Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Maxim Barsky  said
Oct. 6 that the company will get the first look at BP’s assets
in Algeria, which may be worth about $3 billion. BP has
considered divesting stakes in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay and its 60
percent stake in Pan American Energy LLC, Argentina’s second-
largest oil producer, according to people with knowledge of the
matter.  Robert Dudley  took over as chief executive officer on Oct.
1 from  Tony Hayward  after the company took responsibility for
the worst oil spill in U.S. history. BP set aside $32.2 billion
in the second quarter for the spill, and Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  has said the value of the company’s asset base is at
least $250 billion.  BP is said to have considered selling part of its interest
in  Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay , which produced on average 250,000
barrels a day in August. Earlier this year,  China National
Offshore Oil Corp.  paid partner Bridas Corp. $3.1 billion for a
20 percent stake in Pan American, which has an output of about
100,000 barrels a day.  Following is a list of assets that BP has sold or may sell.
The bidders are listed in parentheses underneath.
