Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said China’s exchange-rate policy is unfair to trading
partners and the yuan is more undervalued than other emerging
market currencies.  “It’s significantly undervalued, more so than is true of
any major significant emerging-market currency,” Geithner said
today in a panel discussion in Palo Alto, California. “It’s
unfair to all of China’s trading partners, Americans and others,
because it just creates a playing field that’s unbalanced” and
gives Chinese companies a “huge” short-term advantage,
Geithner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
