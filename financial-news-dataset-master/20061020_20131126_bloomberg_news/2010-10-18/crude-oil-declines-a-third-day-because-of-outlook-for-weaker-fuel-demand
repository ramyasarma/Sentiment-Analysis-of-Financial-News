Oil declined for a third day in New
York amid speculation a report on new homes may add to signs U.S.
fuel demand will remain weak and as investors sold contracts
against a strengthening dollar.  Crude fell as the  Dollar Index  climbed for a second day,
damping the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.
Ground was broken on 3 percent fewer houses in September in the
U.S., the world’s largest oil user, economists estimated before
a Commerce Department report tomorrow. Futures declined even as
hedge funds last week raised bets oil prices would gain.  “For every bit of economic data, we have to watch a few
months to see if there is sign of recovery,” said  Ken Hasegawa ,
a commodity derivative sales manager at brokers Newedge in Tokyo.
“It seems oil will stay in a range between $80 and $84. After
oil reached $84 last week, now is a time for profit-taking.”  Crude for November delivery dropped as much as 70 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $80.55 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $80.75 at 2:55 p.m.
Singapore time. On Oct. 15, the contract lost $1.44, or 1.7
percent, to $81.25, the lowest settlement since Sept. 30.  Oil is in the longest pullback since a four-day losing
streak through Sept. 17. Futures fell 1.7 percent last week, the
first weekly drop in four.  The Dollar Index, used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and Swiss franc, added as much as 0.6 percent to 77.485. The U.S.
currency also climbed 0.7 percent to $1.3884 against the 16-
nation euro.  ‘Choppy’ Data  “Oil continues to be heavily impacted by U.S. dollar
movements,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist
at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “The data out of
the U.S. is pretty choppy at the moment. Some are more positive
than others, some are weaker than you expect.”  U.S. retail sales in September advanced 0.6 percent
following a 0.7 percent gain in August that was larger than
previously estimated, the Commerce Department said Oct. 15.
Purchases were projected to increase 0.4 percent, according to
the median estimate from 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. Work began on 580,000 houses at an annual rate, down 3
percent from August, based on the median of 56 estimates in a
separate poll.  U.S. consumption of refined products rose 1.8 percent in
September from the year before, signaling demand is recovering
as the economy rebounds, the American Petroleum Institute, a
Washington-based industry group, said in an Oct. 15 report. Fuel
deliveries, a measure of demand, averaged 18.9 million barrels a
day, from 18.6 million in September 2009.  Net-long positions  in oil futures and options held by
“managed money,” including hedge funds, commodity pools and
trading advisers, rose 10,198, or 6.1 percent, to 178,738
contracts, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.  Brent crude for December settlement declined as much as 69
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $81.76 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London. On Oct. 15, the contract dropped
$1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.45.  To contact the reporters on this story:
