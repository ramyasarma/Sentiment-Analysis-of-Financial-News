Sales of luxury goods may climb this
year to the highest level since 2007, led by demand in China and
a rebound in the U.S., according to Bain & Co.  Sales of high-end apparel, accessories, watches and jewelry
and other products may rise to as much as 170 billion euros
($236 billion) from 153 billion euros in 2009, helped by
currency moves including the appreciation of the dollar, the
consulting company said today in a study. Sales of leather goods
will lead the increase, gaining 20 percent, Bain estimated.  “After the crisis a new luxury era is emerging,” Bain
said.  Luxury spending contracted 8 percent in 2009, the most
since at least 1995, because of the recession. In 2007, they
reached a high of 170 billion euros. After climbing between
9 percent and 11 percent this year, growth may slow to between
3 percent and 5 percent in 2011, excluding currency moves, Bain
estimates.  Sales in stores directly operated by  makers  of luxury goods
may grow 20 percent in 2010, while wholesale revenue may rise
6 percent as U.S. department stores restock inventories, Bain
said. Luxury-goods companies may open as many as 350 new stores
by the end of the year, mainly in Asia and the U.S., Bain
estimated. Online sales may rise 20 percent, it said.  Sales in mainland China will probably rise 30 percent to
9.2 billion euros, Bain estimated. Sales may grow 22 percent in
the Asia-Pacific region, 12 percent in the Americas and 6
percent in Europe, while falling 1 percent in Japan, Bain said.  Fourth-Quarter Gain  Global sales of luxury goods may rise 1.3 percent in the
fourth quarter, the Boston-based business-consulting company
said.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world’s largest
luxury-goods maker, said last week that third-quarter sales rose
24 percent as wealthy shoppers bought more watches and
accessories. Burberry Group Plc’s sales rose 11 percent in the
three months through September, led by growth in Asia and demand
for coats and leather goods, the U.K.’s largest luxury retailer
said Oct. 13.  In a separate study,  Altagamma , the Italian luxury trade
group, said the industry’s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization may increase 15 percent in 2011.
The prediction is based on estimates by analysts including
Bain’s, Altagamma said in an e-mailed statement.  “In 2011 we are going to witness even better growth,” led
by leather goods, watches and jewelry,  Armando Branchini ,
executive director of Fondazione Altagamma, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
