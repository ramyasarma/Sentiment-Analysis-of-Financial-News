U.K.  stocks  climbed, rebounding from
an earlier retreat, as a selloff in mining companies was offset
by better-than-expected earnings at Citigroup Inc. and takeover
activity in the asset management industry.  HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, and Barclays Plc
both advanced more than 1 percent in London.  BlueBay Asset
Management Plc  soared to a three-year high after Royal Bank of
Canada agreed to buy the firm.  BHP Billiton Ltd . and  Rio Tinto
Group  limited gains as the firms abandoned an iron ore joint
venture.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  rose 0.7 percent to 5,742.52
at the close in London, after earlier falling as much as 0.6
percent. The  FTSE All-Share Index  increased 0.6 percent today
and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  gained 0.4 percent.  “It was earnings from Citigroup that really cheered the
market up,” said London-based Angus Campbell, head of sales at
Capital Spreads. The market’s reverse “signals continued
underlying confidence in the stock market and when compared to
other assert classes, equities are still generating good
returns.”  Stocks rallied as Citigroup said profit surged to $2.17
billion, or 7 cents a share as the third-biggest U.S. bank by
assets reduced loan-loss reserves by $1.99 billion. Bank of
America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
are also scheduled to post results in the U.S. this week.  HSBC paced a gauge of U.K. banks higher, climbing 1.1
percent to 660.4 pence. Barclays increased 1.5 percent to 289.25
pence and Lloyds Banking Group Plc advanced 2.9 percent to 72.20
pence.  BlueBay, Ashmore, Henderson  BlueBay  soared 30 percent to 487 pence after RBC, Canada’s
biggest lender, agreed to buy the asset manager for about 963
million pounds ($1.5 billion). The firm will pay 485 pence a
share in cash for BlueBay, a 29 percent premium to the asset
manager’s closing price on Oct. 15.  Rivals Ashmore Group Plc and Henderson Group Plc climbed
1.5 percent to 381.6 pence and 4.7 percent to 137.6 pence
respectively. Man Group Plc, the world’s largest publicly traded
hedge-fund manager, advanced 2.2 percent to 269.9 pence.  BP Plc  advanced 1.6 percent to 432.15 pence after the
energy company agreed to sell assets in Venezuela and Vietnam to
Russian oil venture TNK-BP for $1.8 billion as it raises money
to help pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  BP, which owns the TNK-BP venture 50-50 with a group of
Russian billionaires, will book the cash in full, London-based
spokesman Mark Salt said. TNK-BP will make a $1 billion deposit
by Oct. 29 and pay the remainder on completion of the deal,
which is expected in the first half of 2011.  Autonomy, Bellway  Autonomy Plc  jumped 5.3 percent to 1,419 pence, rebounding
from the longest losing streak since July. Panmure Gordon & Co.
wrote in a report today that the software company may announce
an acquisition when it reports third-quarter earnings this week.  Bellway Plc led homebuilders higher after a Rightmove Plc
report showed London home sellers raised asking prices by the
most in six months in October. The stock rallied 2.6 percent to
601.5 pence.  Persimmon Plc , the U.K.’s third-largest homebuilder by
volume, climbed 2 percent to 386.2 pence, and Taylor Wimpey Plc,
the second-biggest, also gained 2 percent to 26.11 pence.  BHP slid 0.6 percent to 2,185.5 pence and Rio Tinto lost
1.5 percent to 4,080 pence after abandoning a plan to create the
world’s largest iron-ore exporter amid regulatory concern from
Europe to Asia that it would limit competition.  The changes, including asset sales, demanded by regulators
were unacceptable to both companies, Rio said in a statement.
The plan would have saved the metal producers more than $10
billion.  Xstrata, Vedanta  Xstrata Plc  slipped 0.5 percent to 1,305.5 pence and
Antofagasta Plc lost 1.5 percent to 1,288 pence after HSBC
Holdings Plc lowered its recommendation for the copper producers
to “underweight” from “neutral.”  “In the short run, copper looks as if it could be headed
for a squeeze,” wrote analysts in a report to clients. “We
would argue that copper’s good prospects are already in the
price of the both the metal and the equities.”  HSBC also lowered its recommendation for  Vedanta Resources
Plc  to “neutral” from “overweight.” The shares lost 1.5
percent to 2,253 pence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
