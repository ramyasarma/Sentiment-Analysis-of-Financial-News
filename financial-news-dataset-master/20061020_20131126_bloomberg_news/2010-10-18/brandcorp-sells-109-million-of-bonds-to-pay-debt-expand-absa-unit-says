Brandcorp Holdings Ltd. , a South
African company that sells branded handbags and luggage, sold
750 million rand ($109 million) of bonds to repay debt and
provide funding for potential acquisitions, Absa Capital said.  The company, based in Johannesburg, sold 375 million rand
each of bonds due September 2014 and September 2015, Absa
Capital, the investment banking arm of Barclays Plc-owned  Absa
Group Ltd. , which arranged the sale, said in an e-mailed
statement.  The four-year bonds were priced to yield 500 basis points
above the three-month  Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate  while
the five-year bonds yielded 525 basis points more than South
Africa’s benchmark money market rate, according to Absa Capital.  The debt was sold exclusively to South African investors
and is the country’s largest-ever listed high-yield bond issue,
according to Absa Capital. The three-month Jibar rate was at
6.985 percent by 10:42 a.m. local time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
