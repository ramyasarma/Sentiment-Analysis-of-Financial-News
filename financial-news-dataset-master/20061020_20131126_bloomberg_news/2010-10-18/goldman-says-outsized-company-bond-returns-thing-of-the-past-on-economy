“Outsized” returns in corporate
bonds are a thing of the past because an increase in government
yields as the economy recovers will squeeze the debt’s
performance, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Company bonds will return 1.2 percent over the coming year
compared with 4.7 percent in the past three months, Goldman
strategists led by  Charles Himmelberg  and  Alberto Gallo  in New
York wrote in an Oct. 15 report. Money managers can still aim
for double-digit returns by investing in bonds of high-yield
issuers, banks and companies in Europe’s periphery, they wrote.  “The outsized returns available in corporate credit are
firmly behind us,” wrote Himmelberg and Gallo. “Meaningful
spread compression is nearly impossible to envision without a
corresponding rise in the currently very low levels of
government bond yields.”  Investment-grade corporate bonds have returned 9 percent
this year, following gains of 16 percent in all of 2009,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market
Corporate Index. The debt is now more attractive relative to
government bonds for excess rather than for total returns,
Himmelberg and Gallo wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
