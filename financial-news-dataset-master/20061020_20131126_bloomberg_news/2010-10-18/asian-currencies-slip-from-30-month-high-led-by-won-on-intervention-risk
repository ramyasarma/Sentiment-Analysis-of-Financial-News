Asian currencies weakened for the
first time in four days, led by South Korea’s won, on concern
regional central banks will seek to counter appreciation that
may hurt exports.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index  retreated from its
highest level since April 2008 as a technical indicator signaled
the U.S. currency was likely to rebound. The dollar last week
sank to its lowest level in at least 13 years against the
Singapore dollar, Thai baht and Malaysia’s ringgit, depreciating
amid concern the Federal Reserve will print more money to
support the U.S. economy.  “The dollar has already priced in another round of U.S.
quantitative easing and so some investors are buying it back,”
said  Yuji Kameoka , a senior economist at the Daiwa Institute of
Research Ltd. in Tokyo. “With sharp appreciation in regional
currencies, some local authorities may want to curb gains in the
short term as Asian economies largely depend on exports.”  The won slumped 0.7 percent to close at 1,119.03 per dollar
in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Singapore
dollar slid 0.7 percent to S$1.3050 as of 4:30 p.m. local time,
the biggest decline since June. The baht fell 0.3 percent to
29.92 and the ringgit dropped 0.5 percent to 3.1000.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10-most
used currencies excluding the yen, lost 0.5 percent. The gauge’s
14-day  relative strength index , which traders use to predict
price reversals, was 74 at the end of last week. A reading of
more than 70 indicates the dollar is likely to rebound.  Countering Appreciation  Equity funds investing in Asia excluding Japan took in more
than $1 billion in all but one of the four weeks through Oct. 13,
according to data from EPFR Global. Asia’s developing economies
will expand 9.4 percent in 2010, compared with growth of 2.7
percent in advanced countries, the International Monetary Fund
forecast on Oct. 6.  The won fell for a second day, retreating from a five-month
high. The Bank of Korea on Oct. 14 held off from raising
interest rates for a third month, citing concern about a
strengthening currency. Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said a
day later that exchange-rate uncertainty must be monitored.  “We suspect there could be some intervention as the won
has strengthened a lot in the past few weeks,” said  Ko Yun Jin ,
a currency trader at Kookmin Bank in Seoul. “Since the won has
a bit of difficulty going past 1,110, traders are starting to
buy back the dollar.”  Thailand’s baht fell for the first time in a week as
economists forecast the central bank will keep interest rates on
hold at a review on Oct. 20 and government data due the same day
will show exports grew at the slowest pace in 11 months.  Keeping Rates  A report today showed Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports
rose 22.7 percent in September from a year earlier, slowing from
a revised gain of 30.8 percent the previous month. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase of 19.7 percent.  In Taiwan, the local dollar weakened 0.3 percent to
NT$30.885 before data due on Oct. 20 that will show export
orders rose 13.5 percent in September, compared with a 23.3
percent gain in August, according to a Bloomberg survey. That
would be the smallest gain since October 2009.  China’s yuan slid 0.04 percent to 6.6438. Gross domestic
product increased 9.5 percent from a year earlier in the third
quarter, a report on Oct. 21 may show, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso fell 0.1 percent to 43.245
and the Indonesian rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 8,933.  To contact the reporter on this story:
