China’s stocks  fell for the first
time in eight days, led by material and agriculture producers,
on concern this month’s rally that drove the benchmark index to
a bull market was excessive relative to the outlook for earnings.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. slid 6.1 percent, snapping an
eight-day, 58 percent gain. Gansu Dunhuang Seed Co. led declines
among agriculture producers and smaller-company stocks after
cotton and corn prices dropped on speculation investors are
trimming their bets on further gains. Citic Securities Co. and
Haitong Securities Co. led advances among  brokerages  on
speculation increased stock trading volumes will boost revenue.  “The markets are overbought and are taking a breather after
the post-holiday gains,” Zhou Xi, a strategist at Bohai
Securities Co., said by telephone. “There’s a good chance the
liquidity-driven rally will continue as sentiment is good.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the biggest of
China’s stock exchanges, lost 15.9, or 0.5 percent, to 2,955.23
at the 3 p.m. close. The measure briefly rose above 3,000 today
for the first time since April. It has rebounded 25 percent from
the 2010 low on July 5, entering a bull market on Oct. 12. The
CSI 300 Index declined 0.7 percent to 3,306.16 today.  Yanzhou Coal fell 1.72 yuan to 26.46 yuan. Shandong Gold
Mining Co., the nation’s second-largest producer by market value,
dropped 9 percent to 58.50 yuan. Zhongjin Gold Corp. slid 9
percent to 42.39 yuan. Gold declined for a second day, after
reaching a record last week, as a strengthening dollar eased
demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  Energy producers have rallied the most among the  10
industry groups  in the CSI 300 Index this month, gaining 23
percent. They now trade at 20 times reported earnings, compared
with 15.6 times at the end of September, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Agriculture Stocks  Gansu Dunhuang paced declines for farm stocks, slumping 8.4
percent to 29.96 yuan. Xinjiang Talimu Agriculture Development
Co. plunged 10 percent to 16.99 yuan. The CSI Smallcap 500 Index
dropped 1.2 percent. Corn for December delivery fell as much as
0.9 percent to $5.58 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
traded at $5.59 at 10:03 a.m. Singapore time.  “The decline in global agriculture futures is weighing on
farm stocks today,” said  Wu Zhengwu , a Shanghai-based analyst
at AJ Securities Co.  A gauge of financial stocks rose 0.6 percent today. Citic,
the nation’s largest brokerage, climbed 1.8 percent to 15.23
yuan. Haitong advanced 1.7 percent to 11.67 yuan. Investors
traded 31.8 billion shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
exchanges on Oct. 15, the most since Nov. 26, 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Household Deposits  The  Shanghai Composite  had gained 14 percent in the seven
days before today, the longest winning streak since the eight
days to Nov. 10, 2009. The Shanghai measure rose 8.5 percent
last week, the most since Feb. 6, 2009, after the markets were
shut the prior week for a holiday as global stocks rallied.
Even with this month’s rally, the Shanghai measure is still down
9.8 percent this year after the government raised banks’ reserve
requirements and curbed lending to cool the economy and avert
asset bubbles.  “Some investors may want to lock in profit because they
are unsure whether the rally will continue,” said Zhang Qi, an
analyst at Haitong. “The rally was driven by liquidity, so
further gains depend on new cash flow into the stock market.”  The  Se Shang Property Index  added 1.4 percent, the most
among the five industry groups in the Shanghai Composite. Even
with today’s gains, the measure is down 17 percent for the year.
China Vanke Co., the biggest developer, advanced 0.8 percent to
9.63 yuan.  Further stock gains will be driven by the continued
appreciation in the yuan and the end of more tightening measures
by the government to cool the housing industry, Citic analysts
led by Xi Feng wrote in a report today. Stocks will extend a
rally as institutional investors allocate more funds to equities,
according to Citic.  Household Deposits  The nation’s equities may also extend this month’s rally as
record household deposits pave the way for more investment into
Asia’s second worst-performing equity market this year.  “We’ve seen money chasing real estate, commodities, art
and even garlic this year,” said  Leo Gao , who helps oversee
$600 million at APS Asset Management Ltd. in Shanghai. “If you
look around, nothing is cheaper than stocks.”  China’s household deposits increased 1.04 trillion yuan
($156 billion) in September, the biggest rise in seven months,
to 29.9 trillion yuan.  The Shanghai gauge on Oct. 12 surpassed the 20 percent
threshold some investors consider the beginning of a  bull market 
on signs that economic growth will remain resilient. The
nation’s third-quarter growth may “surprise on the upside,”
with gross domestic product rising 9.7 percent from year-ago
levels, according to Barclays Plc. The data is scheduled to be
released this week.  -- Chua Kong Ho . With assistance from Jian Guo Jiang. Editors:
