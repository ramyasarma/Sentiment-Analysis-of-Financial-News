CSX Corp. , the second-largest
publicly traded U.S. railroad by revenue, plans to sell $800
million of debt as soon as today, less than a week after
reporting third-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates.  A portion of notes due 2020 may pay 120 basis points to 125
basis points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, and
bonds due in 2041 may pay a spread of about 162.5 basis points,
according to a person familiar with the transaction who declined
to be identified because terms aren’t set.  CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is marketing debt
after reporting third-quarter earnings on Oct. 12 that exceeded
analyst expectations, in part because of a 44 percent increase
in automotive shipments carried by rail. Proceeds from the bond
sale may be used to repay outstanding debt, buy back stock or
improve productivity at the company’s major transportation
units, CSX said today in a regulatory filing that didn’t specify
the sale’s size or timing.  The railroad last tapped the U.S. debt market in January
2009, issuing $500 million of 7.375 percent notes that mature in
February 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
securities traded at 127.25 cents on the dollar on Oct. 14 to
yield 3.548 percent, or 109.7 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The debt CSX plans to sell next may be rated Baa3 by
Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s, the
person said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  CSX reported third-quarter profit excluding some items of
$1.08 a share, beating the  average estimate  of 24 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg of $1.04.  Union Pacific Corp.  is the largest publicly traded U.S.
railroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
