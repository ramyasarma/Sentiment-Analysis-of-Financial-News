New World Resources NV, the Czech
Republic’s biggest supplier of coal to steelmakers, has offered
an “honest” price of 100.75 zloty per share for Lubelski
Wegiel Bogdanka SA and won’t raise its bid for the Polish coal
producer, NWR’s Chief Financial Officer Marek Jelinek was quoted
today as saying in the newspaper Parkiet.   “If investors don’t agree to that price, we’ll give up
Bodganka,” Parkiet cited Jelinek as saying in an interview.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
