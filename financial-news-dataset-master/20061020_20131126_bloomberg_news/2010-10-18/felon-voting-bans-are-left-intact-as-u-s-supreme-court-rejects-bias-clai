The  U.S. Supreme Court  refused to
consider giving convicted felons the right to file race-
discrimination suits challenging state laws that bar them from
voting.  The justices today turned away an appeal from three
Massachusetts inmates who sought to invalidate a state law that
prohibits voting by incarcerated felons. The inmates said the
restriction, approved by the state’s voters in 2000, violates
the U.S. Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately affects
blacks and Hispanics.  Forty-eight of the 50 states -- all but Vermont and  Maine  -
- prohibit incarcerated felons from voting, with many states
also restricting inmates who have been released from prison.  In upholding the Massachusetts law, the Boston-based 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals pointed to the Constitution’s 14th
Amendment, which says states can strip voting rights from people
convicted of crimes. The appeals court also said Congress didn’t
intend to limit that authority when it enacted the Voting Rights
Act in 1965 and amended the law in 1982.  The Obama administration joined Massachusetts in urging the
Supreme Court not to disturb the appeals court ruling.  The case is Simmons v. Galvin, 09-920.  To contact the reporter on this story:
