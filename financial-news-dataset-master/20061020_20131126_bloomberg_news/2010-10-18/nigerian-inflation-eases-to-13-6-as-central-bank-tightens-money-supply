Nigerian inflation slowed in
September as the central bank tightened the supply of money in
circulation and raised a key interest rate in the second half of
the month.  The inflation rate fell to 13.6 percent from 13.7 percent
in August, the Abuja-based  National Bureau of Statistics  said in
a statement today.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  conducted “a lot of mopping
up” operations by selling treasury bills, said Pabina Yinkere,
an analyst at Access Bank Plc in the commercial hub of Lagos.
“This, combined with the hike in the monetary policy rate”,
helped to moderate inflation.  The central bank raised its key lending rate by a quarter
of a percentage point to 6.25 percent on Sept. 21. Rising wage
costs, increased government spending to organize elections and
higher food prices are threats to inflation, bank governor,
 Lamido Sanusi , told reporters after the decision.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer and the continent’s most
populous country, is targeting inflation of less than 10
percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
