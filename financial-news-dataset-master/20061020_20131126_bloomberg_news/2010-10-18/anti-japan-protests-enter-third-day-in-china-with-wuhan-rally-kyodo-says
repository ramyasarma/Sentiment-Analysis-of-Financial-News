An anti-Japanese protest was held in
the central China city of Wuhan yesterday, the third day of
demonstrations in the country over rival claims to uninhabited
islands in the East China Sea, Kyodo News reported.   About 1,000 people marched in the capital of Hubei province
calling for a boycott of Japanese products, Kyodo said, citing
the online edition of Hong Kong newspaper Mingpao.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
