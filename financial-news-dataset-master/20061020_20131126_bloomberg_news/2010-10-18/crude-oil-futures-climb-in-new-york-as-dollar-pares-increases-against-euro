Crude oil and gasoline rose the most
in two weeks as a strike in France curbed supplies in Europe’s
second-biggest fuel market.  Oil climbed 2.3 percent, the most since Sept. 30, as French
truckers blocked highways and officials said they’d use police
to prevent strikers from cutting fuel supplies as the standoff
hardened over President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s plans to raise the
retirement age to 62. With the country’s refineries on strike,
industry groups said 15 percent of service stations are dry.  “The length and duration of the French refinery strike is
becoming a material event for the refined-product markets,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-
based hedge fund focusing on energy. “This product strength is
lending strength to crude oil prices.”  Crude oil for November delivery increased $1.83 to settle
at $83.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices
declined as much as 90 cents earlier today. Futures are up 5.8
percent from a year ago.  Gasoline for November delivery gained 4.77 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.1515 a gallon on the Nymex. November heating oil
rose 4.53 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.2761 a gallon.  The French government said it won’t give in to demands that
it suspend parliamentary debate on the change in retirement
plans and keep the minimum retirement age at 60. Sarkozy’s
ministers sought to guarantee fuel, saying police would be
deployed to ensure access to storage sites as the refinery
strikes entered a second week.  Shut Service Stations  About 15 percent of France’s 12,000 service stations have
run out of some or all types of fuel, Alexandre de Benoist, head
of the Independent Fuel Importers Union, or UIP, said by
telephone. “There are stocks but we can’t get at them in some
cases because of blockages at fuel depots,” he said.  Brent crude oil for December settlement climbed $1.92, or
2.3 percent, to $84.37 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London.  Crude also rose as the U.S. dollar erased earlier gains.
The dollar fell 0.1 percent against the euro to $1.3994, after
advancing as much as 1 percent.  The dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency against
six major peers including the euro and the yen, slid 0.1 percent
to 76.947 after rising as much as 0.8 percent.  A weaker dollar raised crude’s appeal as an alternative
investment.  Higher Oil  Central bank stimulus, or quantitative easing, may push oil
prices to $100 a barrel in 2011 by weakening the U.S. dollar,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Commodity Strategist  Francisco Blanch  said in an Oct. 17 research report.  This poses a dilemma for Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  since high oil prices will create a burden on the
average American, taking away the benefit of other effects of
quantitative easing, according to the report.  “The Fed is creating a bit of uncertainty in the
marketplace,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago. “The market is still a bit disappointed
that  Ben Bernanke  gave no hints to the size and scope of the
next round of quantitative easing.”  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
 confidence index , which gauges confidence among homebuilders,
increased to 16 from 13 the prior month, data from the
Washington-based group showed today.  U.S. consumption of refined products rose 1.8 percent in
September from the year before, signaling demand is recovering
as the economy rebounds, the American Petroleum Institute, a
Washington-based industry group, said in an Oct. 15 report. Fuel
deliveries, a measure of demand, averaged 18.9 million barrels a
day, up from 18.6 million in September 2009.  Net-Long Positions  Net-long positions  in oil futures and options held by hedge
funds, commodity pools and trading advisers, rose 10,198, or 6.1
percent, to 178,738 contracts, according to the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  Crude was little changed earlier today after the Federal
Reserve reported industrial production in the U.S. unexpectedly
dropped in September for the first time in more than a year,  Output at factories, mines and utilities fell 0.2 percent,
the first decline since the recession ended in June 2009,
according to figures from the Fed today.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 596,432
contracts as of 2:52 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 754,442
contracts on Oct. 15, 10 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.46 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
