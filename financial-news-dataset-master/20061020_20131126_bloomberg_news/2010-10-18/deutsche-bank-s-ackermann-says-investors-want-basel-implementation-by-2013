Deutsche Bank AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  said the bank’s investors want Basel III
capital rules to be implemented by 2013 rather than the target
date of 2019.  Ackermann said investors he met while marketing Deutsche
Bank’s 10.2 billion-euro ($14.2 billion) share sale told him
they would not wait until 2019 for the bank to meet the full
capital requirements proposed by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  last month.  “I call this the race among regulators, among market
participants and investors as somewhat a race to the top,”
Ackermann said at a conference organized by the Financial
Markets Group at the  London School of Economics .  “Investors
will not wait until 2019.”  Ackermann has previously said that Deutsche Bank would meet
Basel III requirements by 2013. Under rules proposed by the
committee, lenders would need at least a 7 percent Core Tier 1
capital ratio by 2019.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
