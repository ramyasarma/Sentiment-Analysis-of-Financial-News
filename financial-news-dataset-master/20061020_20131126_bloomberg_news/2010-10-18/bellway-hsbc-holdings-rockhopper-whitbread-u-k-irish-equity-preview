U.K. stocks retreated, led by
declines in basic-resource shares, after China’s central bank
unexpectedly raised one-year lending and deposit rates by 25
basis points.  Xstrata Plc fell 4.4 percent as metal prices retreated on
the London Metal Exchange. ARM Holdings Plc, the designer of
chips that power Apple Inc.’s iPhone, declined 2.6 as Apple

increased third-quarter revenue and adjusted gross margin.  The FTSE 100  decreased 38.63, or 0.7 percent, to 5,703.89
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, erasing yesterday’s advance.

July 1 as investors speculated that the Federal Reserve will
announce plans to stimulate economic growth in November as the
recovery wanes. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also dropped 0.6
percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  fell 0.6 percent today.  “We are in a difficult situation at the moment as
investors are waiting to see what will be the next action of the
Fed in November,” said  Jens Finkbeiner , who oversees 150
million euros ($207.4 million) at F+m Financial GmbH in
Frankfurt. “The market rose strongly already and a year-end
rally is possible, but the question is how much higher can the
market go.”  Xstrata, Rio Tinto Fall  Xstrata slumped 4.4 percent to 1,248.5 pence as the U.K.’s

production fell 5 percent and China increased its interest
rates. Rio Tinto dropped 3.2 percent to 3,948 pence. European

yesterday’s 2.9 percent advance. Apple forecast profit of about
$4.80 a share in the current quarter, which includes the end-of-
year holiday shopping season. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had
predicted profit of $5.03.  Autonomy Corp.  added 1.8 percent to 1,444 pence as the

products rose and it closed some pending deals.  Jupiter Fund Management Plc  jumped 9.6 percent to 285
pence, the highest price since it first sold shares to the

two days of gains. The construction company said that its sales
increased less than usual in September because government plans
to cut spending have deterred people from buying homes.  Mothercare Plc  (MTC LN) rallied 5.3 percent to 523.5 pence
