Johnson & Johnson’s  McNeil Consumer
Healthcare unit said it is recalling one product lot of Tylenol
8-hour caplets containing 127,728 bottles, following complaints
from consumers of a musty or moldy odor.  The recall is the third in the past year linked to odors
affecting medications made by the New Brunswick, New Jersey-
based company. The odor is thought to be tied to a chemical
called 2,4,6-tribromoanisole, said  Marc Boston , a spokesman for
McNeil. The chemical is applied to wooden pallets used to store
packing materials, J&J has said.  J&J received a warning letter in January from the Food and
Drug Administration saying the company had waited more than a
year to notify regulators after receiving complaints early in
2008 about odors in Tylenol Arthritis Pain Caplets. The company
recalled some lots of the medicine in December 2009 and, a month
later, announced that a variety of over-the-counter products
would be recalled because of similar odor complaints. Lawmakers
and the FDA also are investigating J&J in connection with a
separate April recall of more than 40 types of children’s
medicines.  “We believe it’s from packing components and we’re
continuing to investigate,” Boston said in a telephone
interview about today’s Tylenol recall.  J&J gained 29 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $63.86 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company’s
shares  increased  5.6 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
