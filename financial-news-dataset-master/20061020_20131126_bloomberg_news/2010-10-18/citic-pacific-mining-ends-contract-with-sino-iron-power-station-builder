Citic Pacific Ltd. , an arm of
China’s biggest state-owned investment company, said it ended an
agreement with the contractor building a power station at its
$5.2 billion  Sino Iron  project in Western Australia.  Austrian Energy & Environment  failed to meet the contract
terms, the Australian unit of Citic Pacific said today in an e-
mailed statement. Construction is nearing completion and
progress of the project won’t be affected, it said.  Concentrate from the 28 million-metric-ton iron ore project
at Cape Preston, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southwest of Karratha
in the Pilbara region, will be shipped from the first half of
next year, Citic Pacific said Aug. 18.  A spokeswoman for AE&E in Vienna declined to comment ahead
of a statement the company plans to issue tomorrow. She
requested not to be identified, in line with company policy. No
official at AE&E Australia Pty Ltd., the company’s Australian
unit, was available for comment.  The 450-megawatt combined-cycle gas-fired power station
will be fueled by natural gas from the Reindeer field, a joint
project between Apache Corp. and Santos Ltd. The plant will have
a capacity equivalent to the current energy needs of the entire
Pilbara region, the company said last year.  Citic Pacific  rose 0.3 percent to HK$19.84 at the 4 p.m.
close of trade in Hong Kong today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
