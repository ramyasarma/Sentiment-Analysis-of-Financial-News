The New Zealand city of Christchurch
and surrounding districts were rocked by a magnitude 5
 earthquake , six weeks after the nation’s largest temblor in more
than 80 years caused widespread damage there.  The temblor struck at 11:32 a.m. local time and was
centered about 10 kilometers (6 miles) southwest of the city,
which is the largest on the nation’s South Island, the
government agency said on its  website . The epicenter was 9
kilometers below ground.  Christchurch is recovering from a magnitude 7 earthquake on
Sept. 4 that damaged houses, buildings and roads and may cost
more than NZ$4 billion ($3 billion) to repair, according to
preliminary Treasury Department estimates. Today’s aftershock
was the strongest of 30 felt in the region over the past week,
according to GNS Science.  Lyttelton Port Co. Ltd. , the largest container terminal on
the South Island, “temporarily suspended operations” to carry
out checks on its wharf and equipment, Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Davie  said in a telephone interview. He expected that
operations would resume this afternoon.  Power was cut to about 10,000 customers of Christchurch-
based Orion Networks Ltd. for about 15 minutes, the stuff.co.nz
website reported, citing the distribution company. A shopping
mall was evacuated after shops suffered damage to stock,
according to the report.  Departures from Christchurch’s airport were delayed while
the runways were checked, Radio New Zealand reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
