China’s stocks rallied for an eighth
day, driving the Shanghai Composite Index above 3,000 for the
first time April, as the nation’s economic growth and prospects
for yuan appreciation spur fund flows into the country.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the big
China’s stock exchanges, gained 37.2, or 1.3 percent, to
3,008.44 at 9:36 a.m. local time, heading for the first close
above the 3,000 level since April 21. The 915-stock measure
entered a so-called bull market on Oct. 12, rebounding 28
percent from the 2010 low on July 5.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
