The Indian rupee’s 6 percent climb in
the past seven weeks left the currency close to a level that may
prompt the central bank to intervene in the foreign-exchange
market to limit gains for the first time in 11 months.  The government is comfortable with a rate between 43 and 45
per dollar, said a Finance Ministry official with direct
knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because
the issue is sensitive. The rupee, the second-best performer in
Asia outside of Japan since Aug. 30 after South Korea’s won,
fell 0.2 percent today to 44.44.  Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao would join
policy makers from Japan to Brazil who have sold their
currencies to keep exports competitive as the global recovery
loses momentum. Infosys Technologies Ltd., India’s second-
biggest software exporter, said last week that volatility in the
exchange rate would ‘kill’ exporters, while pharmaceutical
companies such as Cipla Ltd. and Ipca Laboratories Ltd. called
on the central bank to curb swings in the rupee.  “Global demand is already weak and many are starting to
intervene,”  Sonal Varma , a Mumbai-based economist with Nomura
Holdings Inc., said in a phone interview yesterday. “We won’t
be surprised if the RBI did start intervening before 43 as
well.”  Currency forecasters bet India’s rupee will drop during the
rest of this year and climb in 2011. The rupee will trade 0.6
percent lower at 44.70 per dollar on Dec. 31, according to the
median prediction of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
currency will advance 3.9 percent to 42.70 by the end of 2011,
according to 14 analysts.  ‘Not a Concern’  “We should watch the situation but it’s not a matter of
concern,” Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in an
interview to Bloomberg-UTV on Oct. 15 in Birbhum in the eastern
state of West Bengal. “We need not press the panic button.”  The central bank, which last intervened in November 2009,
says that the currency’s strength will be limited by the
nation’s deteriorating trade balance. Exports climbed 22.5
percent in August, down from growth of as much as 54.1 percent
in March, according to government data. The current-account
 deficit  widened to a record $13.7 billion in the three months
through June, the Reserve Bank said Sept. 30.  “It comes down to a balancing act between making sure
there’s enough money to finance your current-account deficit,
but at the same time not do any serious damage to people whose
competitiveness is undermined for no fault of their own,”
central bank Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said in the northern
Indian city of Chandigarh on Oct. 14.  Price Swings  Infosys said it suffers a 40-basis point drop in operating
margin for every 1 percent movement in the rupee. The rupee has
gained 15 percent since it slid to a record low of 52.185 in
March 2009 and was as strong as 39.27 on Jan. 15, 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ve seen the rupee go from 52 to 39 and back and
forth,” Infosys Chief Financial Officer  V. Balakrishnan  told
reporters last week. “It will kill the whole export industry.
The RBI has no choice but to intervene at some point in time,
like every other country.”  A. K. Jain, the joint managing director of Ipca
Laboratories Ltd., India’s biggest supplier of anti-malaria
drugs, said the rupee’s gain will start hurting in a few months.  “Suddenly, 6 to 7 percent of your revenues have just
gone,” Mumbai-based Jain said in an interview on Oct. 15.
“Within one month, your cost structures have not come down by 7
percent.”  Bond Yields  India’s 7.8 percent note due May 2020 fell, pushing the
yield up one basis point to 8.10 percent, according to the
central bank’s trading system.  India’s securities returned 3.5 percent in 2010, the
second-worst performance after China among 10 local-currency
debt markets in Asia outside Japan, according to indexes
compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc.  The  difference  in yields between India’s debt due in a
decade and similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries widened 27 basis
points this month to 560. The gap has grown from 375 at the end
of 2009.  Nine of 10 banks surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month
said they expected the central bank to refrain from attempts to
influence the exchange rate in October. Standard Chartered Plc
said policy makers may take steps to reduce swings in the
currency.  ‘Too Volatile’  Option prices signal investors expect wider fluctuations in
the rupee. The implied volatility on one-month dollar-rupee
options has rebounded to 10.7 percent from a five-month low of
7.3 percent on Sept. 13, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Traders quote the gauge of expected swings in exchange rates as
part of option prices.  The rupee has “been too volatile and completely affects
all our planning and strategy,”  S. Radhakrishnan , the Mumbai-
based Chief Financial Officer at Cipla, India’s third-biggest
drugmaker by revenue, said in a phone interview on Oct. 15.  India’s $1.3 trillion economy may expand 8.5 percent in the
year to March 31, the most in three years, the central bank
forecast on July 27. Economic  output  grew 8.8 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the most since 2007, a government
report showed Aug. 31.  Long-Term Growth  “I would use this opportunity to put in place a medium-
term growth strategy through productivity and infrastructure
improvements rather than banking on a cheap currency,”
 Venkatraman Anantha Nageswaran , the Singapore-based global chief
investment officer at Bank Julius Baer & Co., which oversees
$140 billion, said in an interview yesterday. “This is going to
be a problem that will be with us for two to three years, with
the developed countries’ need for a weak currency.”  Christian Gaier , who helps oversee the 1.33 billion euros
($1.85 billion) of the emerging-market debt managed by Erste
Sparinvest KAG, said he doesn’t expect policy makers to draw a
line in the sand as that would be “always dangerous.”  “India’s aim is for long-term growth and a smooth, long-
term appreciation,” Gaier said in an interview yesterday.
“Interventions, yes, they are possible. I don’t expect a major
move such as stopping the rupee appreciation with a hard peg to
the dollar, or closing the market.”  Dangerous Policy  Brazil and Thailand have been selling their own currencies
and taxing global investors to curb appreciation, prompting
calls for the International Monetary Fund to play a greater role
in monitoring capital flows and exchange-rate policy.  Thailand’s cabinet removed a tax exemption last week on
foreign investment in government bonds. South Korea’s central
bank began an audit this month of banks’ foreign-exchange
trading to clamp down on currency speculation. In India, the
government raised its cap on foreign ownership of debt by 50
percent to $30 billion last month.  Allowing the rupee to appreciate fast is “very
dangerous,” A.V. Rajwade, chairman of currency consultancy A.V.
Rajwade & Co. Pvt. in Mumbai, who was part of a central bank
committee that suggested a plan for fuller convertibility of
India’s currency, said in a phone interview yesterday. “I think
they are not taking into account the impact on growth and
jobs.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
