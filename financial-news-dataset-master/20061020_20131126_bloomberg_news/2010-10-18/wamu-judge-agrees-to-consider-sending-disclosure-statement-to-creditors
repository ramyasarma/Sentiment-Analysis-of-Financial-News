The judge overseeing  Washington
Mutual Inc. ’s bankruptcy agreed to consider sending the bank-
holding company’s plan to liquidate most of its remaining assets
out to creditors for a vote.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Mary F. Walrath  denied a request by
shareholders to put off a hearing on the so-called disclosure
statement describing the liquidation plan. The investors asked
Walrath to delay a vote until a court-appointed examiner issues
a report on the failure of Washington Mutual’s former bank, the
biggest bank failure in the U.S.  Should Walrath approve the disclosure statement at the end
of today’s hearing, creditors would be able to vote on the plan
until Nov. 15, two weeks after the examiner’s report is made
public Nov. 1, company attorney  Brian Rosen  said in court.  The liquidation plan would divide $7 billion among
creditors and is based on a settlement among Washington Mutual,
known as WaMu,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , which bought the failed
bank, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is
overseeing the distribution of bank assets to bank creditors in
a separate legal proceeding.  That settlement has the support of all the creditors who
have any realistic chance of getting part of their debts repaid,
noteholder lawyer  Tom Lauria  told Walrath.  “The report is not going to change how everyone is going
to vote,” Lauria said.  The case is In re Washington Mutual Inc., 08-12229, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
