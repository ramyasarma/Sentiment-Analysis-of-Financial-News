Grain-hauling ships have been
blocked since Oct. 16 at ports in Ukraine, the world’s largest
exporter of barley, the Ukrainian Grain Association said.  The national customs service obstructed outbound shipments
“completely,” the Kiev-based association said in a statement
on its  website  today. Loaded vessels that have all documentation
required for their cargoes are being held up, according to the
statement.  The association’s comments are “groundless” and
“untrue,” customs service spokeswomen Svitlana Sudak said
today by phone. Officials are following normal customs
procedures for export cargoes, according to Sudak.  The customs service has imposed additional inspections of
grain batches and accompanying documents since July, resulting
in delays to cereal exports. The government was to decide on a
start date for grain-export quotas “in coming days,”
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
