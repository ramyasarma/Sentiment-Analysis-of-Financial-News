Saudi Arabia’s stocks rose a second
day, driven by gains in  Saudi Basic Industries Corp.  after the
world’s biggest petrochemicals maker said third-quarter profit
surged 46 percent, beating expectations.  Sabic  advanced to the highest level in more than a week
after net income soared to 5.33 billion riyals ($1.4 billion).
 Saudi Electricity Co.,  the state-controlled utility, gained 2.4
percent before reporting a 34 percent increase in third-quarter
profit after markets closed. The  Tadawul All Share Index  rose
0.4 percent to 6,285.24, the highest level since Oct. 13, at the
3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  of Gulf
region stocks rose 0.5 percent.  “Excellent results from Sabic and Mobily” are driving
stocks higher, said  Ahmed Talhaoui , Abu Dhabi-based head of
investment at Royal Capital. The earnings are in “sharp
contrast with the poor results from banks released a week ago.”  Companies in the Persian Gulf have started reporting third-
quarter earnings. The Tadawul declined 1.8 percent  last week 
after six of the kingdom’s lenders reported declines in third-
quarter profit as they set aside money to cover bad debt.  Sabic shares rose 2.3 percent to 91 riyals, the highest
since Oct. 10, after yesterday posting earnings that topped the
4.63 billion riyals  median estimate of five analysts.  The
company expanded sales of fertilizer and plastics as demand
increased and petrochemical prices rose from last year.  Dubai Declines  Etihad Etisalat Co.,  Saudi Arabia’s second-largest mobile-
phone company known as Mobily, said third-quarter profit gained
to 1.14 billion riyals from 807 million riyals a year earlier.  Mobily plans to spend more than 2 billion riyals in 2011 to
expanding its broadband service infrastructure, Chief Financial
Officer  Thamer Muhammed al-Hosani  told Al Arabiya television
today. The shares were unchanged 55.25 riyals at the close after
gaining as much as 2.3 percent.  Saudi Electricity rose to 14.95 riyals, snapping three days
of loses. The company said third-quarter profit advanced to 2.32
billion riyals from 1.73 billion riyals in the year-earlier
period.  In the United Arab Emirates, the  DFM General Index 
retreated 0.3 percent to 1,739.25 at the close in Dubai.  Abu
Dhabi’s measure  increased 0.6 percent and Oman’s  MSM30 Index 
gained 0.3 percent.  Qatar’s measure  fell 0.3 percent and
Bahrain’s  gauge  rose less than 0.1 percent. The  Kuwait SE Price
Index  advanced 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
