Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , India’s
biggest engineering company, said second-quarter profit rose 32
percent, beating estimates, as companies and government
accelerated spending on factories, roads and power plants.  Net income  climbed to 7.65 billion rupees ($172.6 million),
or 12.45 rupees a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from 5.8
billion rupees, or 9.70 rupees, a year earlier, Mumbai-based
Larsen said today in a statement. The  mean estimate  of 24
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 6.6 billion rupees. Sales
rose 18 percent to 92.6 billion rupees.  Larsen won contracts to build factories, roads and water
works as companies invested in new plants to tap rising demand
in Asia’s second-fastest growing major economy. India’s Planning
Commission estimates $1 trillion needs to be spent in five years
through 2017 on roads, ports and power plants.  Larsen’s  shares  pared losses after the quarterly earnings
report. They fell 0.4 percent to 1,980.05 rupees at 1:34 p.m. in
Mumbai after falling as much as 3 percent.  Raw material costs at company increased 21 percent in the
quarter to 20.85 billion rupees, while employee expenses rose 17
percent to 8.3 billion rupees, Larsen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
