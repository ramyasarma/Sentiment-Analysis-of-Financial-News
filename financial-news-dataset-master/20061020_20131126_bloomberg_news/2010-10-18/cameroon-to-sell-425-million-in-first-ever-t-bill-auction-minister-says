Cameroon plans to sell 200 billion
CFA francs ($425 million) of government debt in its first-ever
auction of Treasury bills to help finance energy projects,
Finance Minister Essimi Menye said.  The central African nation will sell the securities within
30 to 45 days from now, Menye said in an interview today in the
capital, Yaounde. He didn’t provide details on interest rates or
the maturities.  Afriland First Bank Group, a lender in the country, pledged
to buy some of the securities and will help the government’s
Treasury and Financial Cooperation Department set up a debt-
management framework, General Manager Alamine Ousmane Mey said
in an interview today. Citigroup Inc.’s  local unit  and  Societe
Generale de Banque au Cameroun , a subsidiary of Societe Generale
SA, will also buy debt and assist the government, he said.  The funds will be used to help build the Lom Pangar dam in
the east of the country that will feed a hydropower plant.
Proceeds will also be used for the Kribi thermal gas plant.  Cameroon established the legal framework for issuing
Treasury bills and bonds in 2007, according to the  African
Development Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
