Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd., South
Africa’s largest black-owned platinum miner, said it’s aiming to
raise as much as 3.2 billion rand ($466 million) though an
initial public offering.  Royal Bafokeng will offer 49.2 million shares for sale,
including an over-allotment option, the company said in a
statement today. The shares are expected to sell for between 56
rand and 65 rand each, Royal Bafokeng said. “There is no
minimum capital requirement to be realized by the offer.”  The shares are due to start trading on the stock exchange
in Johannesburg on Nov. 8, it said.  The company, a unit of Royal Bafokeng Holdings Ltd., holds
67 percent of the Bafokeng Rasimone mine while  Anglo Platinum ,
the world’s largest producer, owns the rest. The mine will be
capable of producing twice its current 200,000 ounces a year
when a second shaft is dug near the town of Rustenburg in the
North West province, Royal Bafokeng Holdings’ Chief Executive
Officer  Niall Carroll  said on June 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
