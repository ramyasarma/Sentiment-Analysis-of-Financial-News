The Dutch government rescheduled the
sale of 2 million metric tons of European Union carbon permits
to Oct. 27, the Utrecht, Netherlands-based Climex exchange said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The Oct. 14 auction was canceled because a “technical
fault,” which meant that “some participants had more
information than others,” Climex said.  There will be no charge for buyers in the Oct. 27 auction
and in a second auction on Nov. 18, Climex said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
