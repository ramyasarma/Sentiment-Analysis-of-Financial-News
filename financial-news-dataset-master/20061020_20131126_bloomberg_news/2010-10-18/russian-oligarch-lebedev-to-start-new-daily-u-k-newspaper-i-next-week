Alexander Lebedev , the Russian
oligarch who owns the  London Evening Standard  and The
 Independent  newspapers, will launch a new U.K. title next week
to complement a new Independent format.  The weekday newspaper, called ‘i,’ will be edited by
Independent Editor-in-Chief  Simon Kelner  and sold for 20 pence
($0.32) per copy, according to a statement from Independent
Print Ltd. The Independent will get a “new look and feel” and
continue to sell for 1 pound an issue.  The Independent, which Lebedev bought in March for 1 pound,
has suffered from dwindling readership and revenue. ‘i’ will
provide an “essential daily briefing” and target “readers and
lapsed readers of quality newspapers,” the statement said. The
title is the first to be launched in the U.K. since The
Independent was founded almost 25 years ago.  “We are creating a newspaper for the 21st century that is
designed for people who have a thirst for information and
entertainment in the limited time that they have available,”
 Andrew Mullins , managing director of The Independent, said in
the statement.  In early 2009, Lebedev also bought the London Evening
Standard for 1 pound and made it free. That newspaper, which
faced financial difficulties, is now approaching profitability
mainly because of an upturn in advertising and higher ad prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
