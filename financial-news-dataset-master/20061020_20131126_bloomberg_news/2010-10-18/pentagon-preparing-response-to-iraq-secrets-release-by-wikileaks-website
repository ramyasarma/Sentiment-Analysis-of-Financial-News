The Pentagon is prepared to quickly
analyze the extent of damage to U.S. national security if more
secret documents are released by the WikiLeaks.org website and
to take action to mitigate problems, a spokesman said today.  A 120-person task force has reviewed the military’s entire
database of low-level Iraq tactical reports compiled during the
conflict in preparation for the possible release of what could
be thousands of similar documents from WikiLeaks.  The Defense Department intends, if and when WikiLeaks
releases its files, to assess the material as soon as possible
and, if necessary, take steps to protect Iraqi individuals named
in the reports, Defense Department spokesman  Colonel David Lapan 
told reporters today.  “We don’t know how these documents might be released, when
they might be released and in what number they might be
released, so we are preparing for all eventualities,” Lapan
said.  He said the Pentagon team is ready to evaluate any released
documents to determine if they pose concerns.  WikiLeaks.org  receives confidential material that
governments and businesses want to keep secret and posts the
information on the Web.  The website published more than 91,000 secret U.S. military
reports from Afghanistan in late July. Reports on the memos
appeared in the  New York Times , Britain’s  Guardian  and Germany’s
Der Spiegel.  The Pentagon set up the review team days after the first
release, and it’s still assessing potential damage from the
Afghanistan documents.  Potential Damage  “We are in the position now, unlike the first time, that
that would happen very quickly,” Lapan said of the analysis.  Lapan said much of the Pentagon’s concern over potential
national security damage centers on Iraqi citizens who might be
named in WikiLeaks documents, and not specifically on
descriptions of battlefield conditions.  In an Aug. 16  letter  to Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman  Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat, Defense Secretary
 Robert Gates  said the release of documents that included the
names of Afghan nationals cooperating with the U.S., is “likely
to cause significant harm” to American security interests.  An “initial review” showed that most of the Afghanistan
information “relates to tactical military operations,” Gates
wrote to Levin. The review “to date has not revealed any
sensitive intelligence sources and methods compromised by this
disclosure,” he wrote.  Taliban Reprisals  Still, the documents contained the names of cooperative
Afghans, and the Pentagon “takes very seriously” reports of
possible Taliban reprisals, Gates wrote.  “We assess this risk as likely to cause significant harm
or damage to the national security interests of the United
States,” Gates wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
