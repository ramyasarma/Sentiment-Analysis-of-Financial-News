Harmony Gold Mining Ltd., Africa’s
third-largest producer of the metal, will close its seventh
South African shaft in a year as it cuts unprofitable business.  The shaft in Free State province “is mined out and with
the current cost pressures in South Africa it is simply no
longer viable to continue mining,” Chief Executive Officer
 Graham Briggs  said in a statement. The closing, scheduled for
the end of the month, is the seventh by Harmony in 12 months,
 Marian van der Walt , a spokeswoman, said by mobile phone.  Harmony, based in Randfontein, South Africa, is among gold
miners grappling with rising electricity prices and above-
inflation increases in labor costs as it digs deeper to extract
shrinking reserves. South Africa has the world’s deepest mines,
where workers operate as far as 2.35 miles underground.  Power charges in the quarter ended September rose by 140
million rand ($20 million) from the prior three months and labor
costs increased by about 50 million rand, Harmony said Oct. 7.  Almost 1,470 workers will be affected by the closing of the
Merriespruit No. 1 shaft at Harmony’s Virginia operations, with
1,200 transferred and about 270 jobs lost, the company said.  Harmony  gained 70 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 77.50 rand by
the 5 p.m. close of Johannesburg trading.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. 
and  Gold Fields Ltd.  are Africa’s largest gold producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
