FIFA’s ethics panel opened probes
into two executive committee members accused of agreeing to
trade their votes for favors from countries interested in
hosting soccer’s World Cup in 2018 and 2022.  The sport’s governing body commented today in an e-mailed
statement. The Sunday Times reported yesterday that officials
from the West African Football Union and the Oceania Football
Confederation indicated to reporters posing as lobbyists that
they would sell their votes.  FIFA didn’t name the countries involved or the executive
committee members. FIFA said it would also investigate the
possibility of countries making agreements about hosting the
event.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
