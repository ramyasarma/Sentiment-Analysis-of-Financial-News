Rubber declined for the first time
in five days, retreating from a 27-month high as a drop in oil
reduced its appeal and stockpiles in China, the largest
consumer, gained to the highest level since April.  The most-active contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange,
or Tocom, lost as much as 1.8 percent to 333.8 yen per kilogram
($4,113 a metric ton) before settling at 335.1 yen. The price
reached 343 yen on Oct. 15, the highest level since July 2008.  Oil traded near a two-week low, weakening the appeal of
natural rubber as an alternative to synthetic products used in
tires. Commodities fell on speculation that builders in the U.S.
started fewer homes in September and as a higher dollar against
the euro curbed investor demand for raw materials as an
alternative asset.  “Rubber retreated in tandem with other raw materials as a
rally in commodities was so steep last week amid expectations
for further monetary easing by the Fed,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an
analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  Futures declined as supply in China increased. I nventories 
monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange expanded 901 tons to
37,801 tons, based on a survey of 10 warehouses in Shanghai,
Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the bourse said on Oct 15.
That was the highest level in almost six months.  Rubber futures in Shanghai slumped as much as 3.1 percent
after stockpiles in China increased. March-delivery rubber
declined to 31,060 yuan ($4,675) a ton before closing at 31,580
yuan. The price reached a record at 32,055 yuan on Oct. 15.  “Falling crude oil prices coupled with a strengthening
Japanese currency pressured rubber prices on Tocom and Shanghai
markets,” Chaiwat Muenmee, analyst at Bangkok-based commodity
broker said by phone today. “If the oil price falls below $80 a
barrel, it could drag rubber prices lower.”  Stronger Yen  The yen rose against all its major peers on speculation
Japan will refrain from intervening to weaken its currency ahead
of this week’s meeting of policy makers from Group of 20
nations.  Japan’s currency traded near the strongest level in more
than 15 years versus the greenback before a report tomorrow
forecast to show U.S. housing starts fell, supporting the case
for additional monetary easing. The yen strengthened to 80.99
per dollar as of 3:58 p.m. in Tokyo from 81.45 in New York on
Oct. 15 when it touched 80.88, the strongest level since April
1995 and near its post-World War II high of 79.75 yen reached
the same month.  Losses in rubber futures were limited as heavier-than-usual
rain in Southeast Asia and China curbed output. Supply in
Thailand remains limited amid widespread rainfalls, according to
the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand. Cash prices in
Thailand dropped 0.2 percent to 119.75 baht ($4) per kilogram
today, trading Tokyo market.  A severe drought in Yunnan at the beginning of this year
and recent torrential rain in Hainan, the top two producing
areas in China, will reduce domestic rubber output, according to
Guo Cheng, an analyst at Yongan Futures Co.  Natural-rubber imports by China, the world’s largest user,
jumped 19 percent from a month ago to 190,000 tons in September
as the nation’s  passenger-car sales  to dealerships quickened
from August on additional incentives.  To contact the reporters on this story:
