National Mobile Telecommunications
Co. , the Kuwaiti phone company controlled by Qatar Telecom, said
third-quarter profit declined 3.2 percent as competition
intensified.  Net income  fell to 17.9 million dinars ($63.4 million) from
18.5 million dinars a year earlier, the company, known as
Wataniya, said today in a statement.  “In our home market of Kuwait, we continue to address the
competitive pressures and increased our share in the market,”
Chairman  Sheikh Abdullah Bin Mohammed  Bin Saud Al-Thani said in
the statement. Wataniya competes in Kuwait with Mobile
Telecommunications Co., the market leader known as Zain; and
with Kuwait Telecommunications Co., called Viva.  Profit in the first nine months fell to 53.7 million
dinars, or 107 fils per share, from 97.3 million dinars, or 194
fils, a year earlier, the company said. In the second quarter of
2009, Wataniya booked most of the 52.1 million dinars it won in
a lawsuit against Kuwait’s Communications Ministry.  Wataniya’s customer base rose almost 30 percent to more
than 16.2 million at the end of September, the company said.
Revenue advanced 14 percent in the first nine months to
400.7 million dinars, while earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization gained 11 percent.  Wataniya shares advanced 1.1 percent to 1,920 fils at the
close of trading in Kuwait today before the results were
announced. The stock has gained 25 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
