Honda Motor Co. may cut its assumed
exchange rate for the October-March half to around 80 yen per
dollar from 85 yen, Nikkei English News said, citing a company
official it didn’t identify.    Sony Corp. may cut its assumed rate to the low 80s from 90
yen, the report said, without citing anyone. JFE Holdings Inc.
will probably downgrade its assumed rate of 90 yen to the dollar
for the second half by 5 yen or more, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
