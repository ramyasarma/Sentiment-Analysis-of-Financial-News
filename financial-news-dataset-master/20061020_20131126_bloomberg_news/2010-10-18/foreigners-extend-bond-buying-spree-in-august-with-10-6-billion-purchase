Foreigners bought a net C$11.1
billion ($10.9 billion) of Canadian securities in August, led by
corporate bonds.  Foreign investors purchased C$10.8 billion of bonds in
August, including C$5.3 billion of corporate debt and C$3.2
billion from government-owned companies, Ottawa-based Statistics
Canada said today. Non-residents also bought C$995 million of
stocks, and divested of C$705 million of money-market paper.  Economists predicted a C$6 billion net purchase of Canadian
securities, according to the median of four estimates by
Bloomberg News.  Demand for Canadian bonds this year has been driven by
signs the country has led the Group of Seven nations out of
recession. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty last week repeated a
plan to eliminate the budget deficit in five years and keep
Canada with the lowest debt in the G-7 relative to its economy’s
size.  Foreigners have purchased C$75.7 billion of Canadian
securities so far this year, compared with C$68.9 billion in the
first eight months of last year.  Canadians  bought  a net C$3.38 billion of foreign securities
in August, including C$2.48 billion of stocks and C$1.01 billion
of money-market paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
