Saudi Electricity Co. , a state-
controlled utility, said third-quarter profit advanced 34
percent on higher tariffs for power in the Arab world’s biggest
economy.  Net income increased to 2.3 billion riyals ($610 million)
from 1.73 billion riyals a year earlier, the  Riyadh-based
utility  said in a statement on the Saudi  bourse website  today.
Third-quarter operating profit climbed 34 percent to 2.18
billion riyals.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil supplier, introduced
revised electricity rates for the government, industrial and
commercial sectors on July 1. The tariffs were forecast to
generate more than 3 billion riyals in annual revenue, the
official Saudi Press Agency said in June.  Profit rose on revenue from “increased quantities of
energy sold at higher rates as well as the modification of the
tariff categories,” the company said today.  Saudi Arabia may raise electricity tariffs further as it
seeks to improve energy efficiency, the industry regulator said
this month. The Saudi Electricity and Co-generation Regulatory
Authority will seek higher fees for first-time connectivity and
capacity usage,  Abdullah al-Shehri , the body’s governor said.  Saudi Arabia wants private companies to contribute to the
kingdom’s 300 billion-riyal power-capacity expansion plan to
help cut subsidy costs. The government spends about 50 billion
riyals a year to subsidize fuel needed for power production, al-
Shehri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
