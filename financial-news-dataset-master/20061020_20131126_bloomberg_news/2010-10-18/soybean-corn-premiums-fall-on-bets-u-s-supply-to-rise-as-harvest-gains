Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans this month fell on
bets that U.S. farmers will rush to harvest remaining crops
before rains next week, boosting supplies.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
October dropped to 50 cents to 58 cents a bushel above November
futures, compared with 52 cents to 58 cents on Oct. 15, U.S.
 data  show. Corn premiums fell to 48 cents to 50 cents above
December futures from 49 cents to 51 cents. The  soybean  harvest
was 83 percent completed as of yesterday, and  corn  was 68
percent finished, the government said today.  “There is enough corn and soybeans moving into the
pipeline to meet demand through the end of October,” said  Troy Lust , a commercial grain consultant at FCStone LLC in West Des
Moines, Iowa. “The tail end of the harvest is hitting the
markets hard now.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $11.84 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 5.75 cents, or
1 percent, to $5.5725 a bushel.  Corn production will total 12.664 billion bushels, down 3.8
percent from 13.16 billion projected a month ago and less than
last year’s record 13.11 billion, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said on Oct. 8. The soybean crop was projected at an
all-time high of 3.408 billion bushels, compared with 3.483
billion forecast in September and 3.359 billion last year.  Above-average rainfall beginning Oct. 24 will mark a change
in the U.S. weather pattern, said  Mike Tannura , the president of
T-Storm Weather LLC in Chicago. Farmers will hurry to complete
the harvest before precipitation and wind damage crops left in
fields, he said.  Freight Costs  The cost of moving grain along the middle and upper
Mississippi River to New Orleans today rose to 725 percent of
the 1976 published tariff rates, Lust said. Upper Mississippi
River  quotes  increased to a record 719 percent last week, the
USDA said on Oct. 14. The rate was 656 percent in the week ended
Oct. 6 and 436 percent a year earlier, USDA data show.  Barge-freight costs may fall to 450 percent, or 44 cents a
bushel, by the second week of November as barges used to move
grain on the Ohio River and Illinois River shift to the
Mississippi River to collect supplies from the northern Midwest,
Lust said.  “Exporters are waiting for the cheaper barge rates to help
lift the basis,” improving cash bids and farmer sales, Lust
said. “It looks like freight costs will drop about 16 cents a
week over the next three weeks. We should see a big push in
basis as harvesting is completed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
