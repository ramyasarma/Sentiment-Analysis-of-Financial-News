Corn futures fell for a fourth
straight session and soybeans dropped for a second day on
speculation that a stronger dollar will erode demand for
commodities.  The dollar rose against 8 of 16 major currencies as a drop
in U.S. output damped demand for riskier assets. Corn prices
have gained 34 percent this year and soybeans rose 14 percent as
adverse weather damaged U.S. crops. Hedge funds increased their
bets on a corn rally by 2.3 percent to 410,439 contracts in the
week ended Oct. 12.  “The reversal in the dollar likely means a period of
backing and filling after the recent surge in prices,” said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.
“It’s not a sign that the rally in corn or soybeans is over,
but it has encouraged some profit-taking on the risk trade that
has benefited commodities.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 1
percent, to close at $5.5725 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the first four-day slump since Sept. 23.
On Oct. 13, the price reached $5.88, the highest level since
August 2008.  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to close at $11.95 a bushel in Chicago. On Oct. 15, the
price reached $12.145, the highest level for a most-active
contract since June 5, 2009.  Dry weather in the U.S. Midwest this week will allow
farmers to accelerate harvesting that already is taking place at
a record pace, Gerlach said.  Harvest Estimates  Corn collection may be 65 percent completed as of
yesterday, up from 51 percent a week earlier, and soybean
harvesting may reach 85 percent, up from 67 percent on Oct. 10,
Gerlach said. The U.S. department of Agriculture is scheduled to
update its harvest reports later today.  U.S. corn output will fall 3.4 percent from a year earlier,
reducing reserve inventories before the 2011 harvest to the
lowest level since 1997, the USDA said on Oct. 8. Yield
estimates were cut 6.7 bushels an acre to 155.8 bushels from a
month earlier. Last week, prices jumped 13 percent, the most
since December 2008.  “The path of least resistance is lower with harvesting
moving ahead,” Gerlach said. “We are at the peak of the
harvest supplies” moving into the cash grain markets, Gerlach
said.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest grower and exporter of both
crops. Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
