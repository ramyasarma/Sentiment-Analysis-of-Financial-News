The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  will
rise 7.6 percent to 1,275 in the next 12 months, as investors
become less risk-averse and look ahead to stronger economic
growth in 2012, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  The estimate for year-end 2010 remains 1,200, and stocks
will have “flat” returns in the first quarter of 2011 because
the economic recovery remains fragile, strategists led by David
Kostin wrote in a report dated Oct. 15.  “The cost of equity should decline slightly as 2011
progresses and investors turn their attention to the economic
growth prospects for 2012,” the report said.  The S&P 500 is  up 6.2 percent  this year, as optimism about
corporate earnings and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve
will pump more money into the economy outweigh concerns about
ballooning sovereign debt in some European countries and the
strength of the recovery. The gauge rose 0.7 percent to 1,184.71
as of 4 p.m. in New York.  Goldman said the S&P 500 will still be at 1,200 in six
months, as Fed stimulus measures will have a “minimal” impact
on earnings and “firms will spend cash slowly given spare
capacity, desire to preserve margins and low chief executive
officer confidence.”  The strategists expect no expansion in  price-to-earnings 
ratio on the benchmark index for U.S. stocks in the next 12
months.  The report said risks to the estimates include a jump in
management confidence, a rise in trade protectionism or a
slowdown in emerging markets, especially China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
