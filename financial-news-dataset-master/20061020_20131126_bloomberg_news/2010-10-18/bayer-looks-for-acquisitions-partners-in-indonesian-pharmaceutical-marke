Bayer AG ’s drug unit is interested
in acquisitions and partnerships in Indonesia, said Suchitra
Kataria, head of business development and in-licensing for Asia
Pacific.  Growth in Indonesia’s economy, health-care market and
middle class make the Southeast Asian nation, the world’s fifth-
most populous, an attractive place to invest, Kataria said at a
conference in Singapore today.  “For any kind of deals, I would be pretty much open to
Indonesia,” Kataria said. “That’s where I would put my bets
on. It’s a very, very attractive pharma market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
