Brazil’s real declined for a third
day as the government boosted a tax on foreigners’ purchases of
local fixed-income assets for the second time this month.  The real slid 0.5 percent, the most since Oct. 6, to 1.6740
per dollar at 6 p.m. New York time, from 1.6651 on Oct. 15.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  announced after markets
closed that Brazil will increase its tax on foreigners’
investments in fixed-income securities to 6 percent from 4
percent. The real has gained 1.4 percent since the government
doubled the tax from 2 percent on Oct. 4. The real slumped in
the final 45 minutes of trading today as investors anticipated
Mantega’s announcement.  “This is a pretty strong statement since it comes just two
weeks after it was hiked to 4 percent,”  Win Thin , global head
of emerging markets strategy in New York at Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co., wrote in an e-mail note to clients today.  The tax on foreign investors’ margin deposits for futures
markets will climb to 6 percent from 0.38 percent, Mantega told
reporters in Sao Paulo.  “The tax on margin deposits appears to be geared towards
addressing speculative, leveraged bets on the currency,” Thin
wrote in the note.  Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose the most since Sept. 22, increasing six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 11.28 percent. That yield
suggests traders anticipate the central bank will raise the
benchmark lending rate to about 12 percent by the end of 2011
from 10.75 percent today.  “High inflation would require a rise in interest rates in
2011,”  Andre Perfeito , an economist at Gradual Investimentos,
said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  Inflation will quicken to 5.20 percent by year-end from 4.7
percent at the end of September, according to the median
forecast in an Oct. 15 central bank survey of about 100
economists published today. A week earlier, the median estimate
was 5.15 percent. Consumer prices will rise 4.99 percent in
2011, up from a week-earlier forecast of 4.98 percent, the
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
