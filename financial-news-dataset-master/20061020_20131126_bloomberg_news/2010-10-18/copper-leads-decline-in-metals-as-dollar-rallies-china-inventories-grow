Copper declined along with other
industrial metals as the dollar rose and high prices deterred
purchases by Chinese users amid rising domestic stockpiles.  Futures for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange dropped as much as 1.2 percent to $8,297 a metric ton
and traded at $8,300 at 4:05 p.m. in Singapore. Copper reached
$8,490 a ton on Oct. 14, the highest level in 27 months.  “Metals trading will be driven by what happens to the
dollar,”  Xie Xiaoming , an analyst at Sheng Da Futures Co., said
from Guangdong. “Rising domestic stockpiles are an indication
that consumers are unwilling to buy at these high prices.”  The December-delivery contract on the Comex in New York
fell as much as 1.6 percent to $3.779 a pound, before trading at
$3.7805 a pound. Copper for January delivery in Shanghai lost as
much as 1.5 percent to 62,960 yuan ($9,475) a ton.  Copper stockpiles tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained for a second week to a six-week high of 103,510 tons last
week, according to data provided by the bourse. That’s the
highest level since the week ended Sept. 3.  The metal, used in construction and household appliances,
has risen 7.8 percent in the past month as the  dollar  lost 4.9
percent against a basket of six major currencies. The U.S.
currency rose for a second day against the euro before a German
report tomorrow that may show investor confidence fell to a 21-
month low in October.  ‘Positive Momentum’  “We don’t debate that the market has plenty of positive
momentum,” HSBC Holdings Plc analysts led by  Andrew Keen  wrote
in an Oct. 17 report. “But the problem from an investment
viewpoint is that it is a consensus trade and we would argue
that copper’s good prospects are already in the price of both
the metal and the equities.”  HSBC expects copper to average $3.27 a pound, or $7,200 a
ton in 2011. Prices in London have averaged $7,263.73 this year.  “We identify three downside risks to copper: demand
destruction at $4 a pound, disruption rates that could already
be double-counted in conservative production estimates, and that
the starting balance in the copper market might not be the huge
deficit that consensus appears to believe,” Keen wrote.  Zinc in London fell 1.6 percent to $2,383.75 a ton, lead
lost 1.7 percent to $2,385 a ton and nickel dropped 2.7 percent
to $23,410 a ton. Aluminum decreased 0.4 percent to $2,368 a ton
and tin declined 2.2 percent to $26,150 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
