BlueBay Asset Management Plc, a
London-based manager of fixed-income funds, said it agreed to be
bought by Royal Bank of Canada for about 963 million pounds
($1.5 billion).  Bluebay stockholders will receive 485 pence in cash for
each share, the company said in a statement today. That’s a
premium of 29 percent to Bluebay’s closing price of 375.70 pence
on Oct. 15.  The fund manager’s board unanimously recommended the offer,
which they consider to be “fair and reasonable,” according to
the statement. The deal has “clear benefits” for the fund
manager’s shareholders, clients and employees, the company said.  “This acquisition will further RBC’s strategy to leverage
our position as a top 10 global wealth manager, and continue to
expand our asset-management solutions,”  George Lewis , group
head of RBC Wealth Management, said in the statement.  BlueBay said separately that it had $40 billion of assets
under management as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
