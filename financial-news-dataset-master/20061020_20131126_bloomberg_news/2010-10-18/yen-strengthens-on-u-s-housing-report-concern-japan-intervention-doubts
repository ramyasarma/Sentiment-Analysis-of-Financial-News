The yen strengthened as report
forecast to show a drop in U.S. housing starts drove demand for
the currency as a refuge, and on prospects Japan will refrain
from intervening in markets before a leaders’ meeting.  The yen remained near a 15-year year high against the
dollar before this week’s meeting of policy makers from Group of
20 nations. The dollar traded near a one-week high against the
euro after Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the
nation will preserve confidence in a strong dollar and “will
not engage” in currency devaluation.  “Many nations are sensitive to currency devaluation
measures, making it difficult for Japan to intervene,” said
Kazuya Yashiro, currency analyst at Himawari Securities, Inc. in
Tokyo.  The yen was at 81.22 per dollar as of 8:22 a.m. in Tokyo
from 81.27 in New York yesterday. It reached 80.88 per dollar on
Oct. 15, the strongest since April 1995. The yen traded at
113.33 per euro from 113.25, after touching 112.41 yesterday,
the highest since Sept. 24. The U.S. currency traded at $1.3954
per euro from $1.3934. It reached $1.3831 per euro yesterday,
the highest since Oct. 12.  The yen remained stronger than 82.88 per dollar, where it
traded on Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged selling the currency
to help its export-dependent economy.  U.S., China  Developing countries are intervening in currency markets to
protect their economies against massive inflows of dollars in
what Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  has called a
“currency war.”  U.S. builders broke ground on 580,000 homes at an annual
rate in September, down 3 percent from August, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before
today’s data.  The Dollar Index, used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and pound, fell 0.1 percent to 76.934 yesterday. It touched
76.144 on Oct. 15, the lowest level since Dec. 11.  Geithner also said China’s exchange-rate policy is unfair
to trading partners and the yuan is more undervalued than other
emerging market currencies.  “It’s significantly undervalued, more so than is true of
any major significant emerging-market currency,” Geithner said
in a panel discussion in Palo Alto, California. “It’s unfair to
all of China’s trading partners, Americans and others, because
it just creates a playing field that’s unbalanced” and gives
Chinese companies a “huge” short-term advantage, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
