Terna SpA, Italy’s national power-
grid operator, agreed to sell its solar power unit Rete
Rinnovabile Srl to U.K. private-equity firm Terra Firma Capital
Partners Ltd. for as much as 670 million euros ($936 million).  The deal, to be completed March 31, will be worth between
620 million euros and 670 million euros, according to a
statement distributed by the Italian exchange today.  Italy is expected to be the world’s second-fastest growing
solar market this year with as much as 2.1 gigawatts in new
capacity, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.
Rete Rinnovabile is targeting total capacity of 150 megawatts by
March, which would make it Italy’s largest solar power producer,
the statement said.  Rome-based Terna controls Rete Rinnovabile through
SunTergrid SpA. Rothschild was Terna’s adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
