             Silverstein Properties Inc. and the
California State Teachers Retirement System paid $1.053 billion
for 1177 Avenue of the Americas, a 47-story office tower in
midtown Manhattan.  
 The acquisition is the third New York purchase made by the
joint venture between Silverstein and Calstrs, the second-largest
U.S. pension fund, the New York-based developer said. Tenants of
the 1 million square-foot skyscraper include
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the law firm Dickstein Shapiro
Movin & Oshinsky, the company said in a statement.  
 The seller was Paramount Group Inc., the U.S. real estate
unit of Germany's mail-order retailer Otto Gmbh & Co., based in
Hamburg. Paramount has been one of this year's most active traders
of New York skyscrapers. It bought 60 Wall St., Deutsche Bank AG's
North American headquarters, and agreed to buy 31 West 52nd St.,
the bank's former headquarters. It also sold 32 Old Slip in lower
Manhattan.  
 The Avenue of the Americas building is 97 percent occupied,
said  Dara McQuillan , a spokesman for Silverstein.  
 This deal is the fourth Manhattan sale since mid-year at more
than $1 billion. The others were 388 and 390 Greenwich St., which
sold for $1.575 billion; 280 Park Ave., which sold for $1.28
billion last month; and One Madison Ave., which sold for $1.005
billion in October.  
 Silverstein Properties' earlier purchases with Calstrs were
575 Lexington Ave., a 35-story midtown tower, and 99 Church St.,
the former home of Moody's Inc., which is now being torn down to
make way for a hotel and condominium building designed by
architect Robert A.M. Stern.  
 Silverstein Properties is owned by  Larry Silverstein , holder
of the rights to 6.2 million square feet of offices at the World
Trade Center site. He is scheduled to take over a pair of building
sites at the 16-acre Trade Center next week to start building two
skyscrapers.
