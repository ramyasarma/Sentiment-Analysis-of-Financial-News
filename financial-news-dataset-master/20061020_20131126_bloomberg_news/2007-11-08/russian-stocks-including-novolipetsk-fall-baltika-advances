             Russian stocks including OAO
Novolipetsk Steel and OAO  Magnitogorsk (MMK)  Iron and Steel declined
after Goldman, Sachs & Co. cut its recommendation on the
steelmakers.  
 OAO Baltika Breweries advanced after its earnings increased.  
 The ruble-denominated  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  was little changed at
1,904.20 as of 2:01 p.m. in Moscow. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index sank 0.3 percent to 2,273.18.  
 Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on the Novolipetsk,
Russia's most profitable steel company, to ``sell'' from
``neutral.''  
 Magnitogorsk, owner of Russia's biggest single steel mill,
dropped 2.9 percent to $17 in London trading. Goldman cut its
recommendation on the stock to ``neutral'' from ``buy.'' The
brokerage said it prefers steelmakers Severstal and OAO Mechel
because of their large coal assets.  
 Baltika, Russia's biggest beer brewer, rose as much as 0.9
percent to 1,211 rubles and last traded at 1,202, 0.2 percent
higher than yesterday's close. The company said profit in the
first nine months of the year climbed 32 percent to 335 million
euros ($490 million) compared with the year-earlier period.
