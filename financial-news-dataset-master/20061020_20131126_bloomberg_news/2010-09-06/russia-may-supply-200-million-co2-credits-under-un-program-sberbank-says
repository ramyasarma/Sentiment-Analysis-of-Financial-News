OAO Sberbank started Russia’s
second carbon-credit tender for projects that plan to cut
greenhouse gases under the United Nations’ Joint Implementation
program.  Bids for as much as 30 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent will be accepted from Oct. 4 to Oct. 21, the
state-run lender said today on its website.  The bank, acting as Russia’s agent, plans to coordinate
Russia’s first sales in October,  Vsevolod Gavrilov , head of
carbon projects at Moscow-based Sberbank, said Sept. 6 in St.
Petersburg. Sberbank approved 15 carbon-reduction projects in
July. The nation is seeking a minimum 10 euros ($13.48) a ton
for each of the so-called Emission Reduction Units, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
