             Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.  agreed to
pay 4.63 billion yuan ($682 million) to become the largest
shareholder in Inner Mongolia Haosheng Coal Mining Ltd.,
boosting reserves with its biggest domestic acquisition.  
 Yanzhou’s Shanghai-traded  stock  rose to a three-month high
after the company based in Zoucheng, Shandong province, said it
will buy 35.5 percent of Haosheng from two sellers and seek a
further 15.5 percent through an open bidding process, according
to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.  
 The purchase gives the country’s fourth-largest coal
producer access to 1.64 billion metric tons of reserves held by
Haosheng, developer of the Shilawusu field in northern China.
Yanzhou, which paid more than  $3 billion  for Australia’s Felix
Resources Ltd. in December, said last month it’s seeking
substantial output increases in the next five years.  
 “There were previously concerns among investors about the
potential for growth at Yanzhou because of reserves,” said
Lawrence Lau, an analyst at Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. “The
acquisition of Felix led to a re-rating of the company because
it addressed some of these concerns and this is also part of
that process of increasing reserves and future production.”  
 Yanzhou expanded first-half  output  by 33 percent from a
year earlier. Sales rose 64 percent to 15.2 billion yuan during
the period as a resurgent Chinese economy increased spot prices
at Qinhuangdao port, a domestic benchmark, by 28 percent. Net
income gained 34 percent in the period.  
 ‘Steady and Large’  
 The  shares  gained as much as 4.5 percent to 19.50 yuan in
Shanghai, the highest since May 28, and traded at 19.10 yuan at
11:29 a.m. local time. The benchmark Shanghai composite index
declined 0.4 percent. Yanzhou rose 1.3 percent in Hong Kong.  
 Haosheng, while it has no profit, possesses the potential
to generate “steady and large revenue,” Yanzhou said yesterday.  
 Haosheng was incorporated on March 26 and is now owned by
Eerduosi Jinchengtai Chemical Co., Shanghai Huayi (Group) Co.,
Shandong Jiutai Chemical Industrial Technology Co. and Ordos
City Jiutaimanlai Coal Mining Co., according to Yanzhou. The
coal producer said yesterday it’s buying its stake from
Jinchengtai, Jiutai and Huayi.  
 “It might take a couple of years, though, before this
particular acquisition becomes a driver for growth as it will
take time to set up new mines and for them to go into
production,” Bank of China’s Lau said.  
 Yanzhou’s output may rise by a third this year after
completing the takeover of Australian mining company Felix
Resources in 2009, Vice Chairman  Li Weimin  said in March.
