             Soybeans jumped to a 15-month as a
cold snap threatens crops in China, the biggest consumer of the
oilseed.  
 Freezing weather this week in northeastern China will
reduce crop quality and output, after rains delayed planting,
according to  T-Storm Weather Inc.  in Chicago. Last week, cold
damaged oilseed plants in Canada. U.S. exporters reported sales
of 225,000 tons of soybeans to China for delivery before Aug.
31, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today.  
 “The fear of Chinese crop losses is driving the markets
higher,” said  Gregg Hunt , a broker and market analyst at MF
Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago. China may be forced to import
more soybeans from the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
shipper, Hunt said.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 15.5 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to close at $10.845 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the oilseed reached $10.995,
the highest level since June 2009. The price rose 3.7 percent
last week, the most in two months.  
 Soybean-oil futures for December delivery rose 0.75 cent,
or 1.8 percent, to close at 43.05 cents a pound on the CBOT.
Earlier, the price touched 43.3 cents, the highest level since
Aug. 16. The price has climbed 5.6 percent this year.  
 Speculative buying also increased after the dollar weakened
and crude-oil prices rose, Hunt said.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their  net-long positions  to a four-week high in Chicago soybean
futures and options in the week ended Sept. 14, according to
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  
 Net-long positions, or the difference between bets on price
gains and declines, rose 0.3 percent to 136,979 contracts.  
 “There is more speculative money flowing into the
agricultural markets,” Hunt said.  
 The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.
