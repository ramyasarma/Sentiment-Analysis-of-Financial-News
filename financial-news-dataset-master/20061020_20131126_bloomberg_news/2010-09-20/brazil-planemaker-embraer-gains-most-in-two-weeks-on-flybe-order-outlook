             Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica
SA , the world’s fourth-largest planemaker, gained the most in
two weeks in Sao Paulo trading amid speculation U.K. airline
Flybe may order more jets.  
 Embraer, as the company is known, rose 3.6 percent to 12.12
reais at 2:43 p.m. New York time, and earlier advanced as much
as 4.1 percent, the most since Sept. 1.  
 Flybe, the U.K.’s biggest domestic carrier, in July ordered
35 Embraer jets worth $1.3 billion, with options for 65 planes
and “purchase rights” for a further 40. The airline’s Chief
Executive Officer  Jim French  said today the company is in talks
to make two acquisitions to expand in Europe, boosting the
prospects for increasing jet orders, according to  Rosangela Ribeiro  of SLW Corretora.  
 “If that outlook exists, the effect on the stock is
positive, because it improves the order backlog,” said Ribeiro,
an analyst at the Sao Paulo-based brokerage, who recommends
buying Embraer’s shares.
