             Prices for coal shipped from South
Africa’s Richards Bay, the continent’s biggest export facility
for the fuel, fell to the lowest level in more than five months.  
 Export prices declined 0.9 percent to an average $84.80 a
metric ton in the week to Sept. 17, according to IHS McCloskey
data on Bloomberg. That’s the lowest price since the beginning
of April.  
 The data are an average based on daily price assessments
and a market survey.
