             Hurricane Igor’s damage in Bermuda
will probably cost insurers less than $100 million as the
island’s building standards protected structures from the wind,
according to catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide.  
 Igor passed within 40 miles (64 kilometers) of Bermuda
early today and was 350 miles north of the British territory
with 75-mph winds at 2 p.m. East Coast time, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said in an  advisory . It was moving northeast at
26 mph. The hurricane hit Bermuda with winds gusting up to 93
miles an hour, cutting power to two-thirds of island.  
 Homes are “typically built of limestone or concrete
blocks, and commercial buildings, which are typically reinforced
concrete, are required to be built to withstand sustained winds
of 110 miles per hour,” Boston-based AIR said today in an e-
mail statement.  
 AIR said there was widespread, but generally minor, damage
across the island. The causeway to Bermuda’s airport, which had
been partially washed away by 2003’s Hurricane Fabian, suffered
only minor damage and reopened today. Fabian was Bermuda’s worst
hurricane since 1926, according to the World Meteorological
Organization.
