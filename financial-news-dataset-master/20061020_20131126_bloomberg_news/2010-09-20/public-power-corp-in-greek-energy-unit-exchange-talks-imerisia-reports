             Public Power Corp SA is in talks
with French, Italian and German companies on swapping operations
of energy units, Imerisia newspaper said.  
 Vienna-based Verbund AG and Italian energy producer Sorgenia
SpA are among companies Public Power is in talks with, the
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.
Public Power is seeking to operate units owned by the other
companies while those companies could operate units located in
Greece, Imerisia said.   
 The approach could mean that Public Power avoids selling its
assets, including lignite units, because of pressure to open up
the Greek energy market, Imerisia said.
