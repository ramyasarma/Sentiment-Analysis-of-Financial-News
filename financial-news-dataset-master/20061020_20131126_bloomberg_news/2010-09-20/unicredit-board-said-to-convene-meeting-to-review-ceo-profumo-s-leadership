             UniCredit SpA ’s board will meet
tomorrow to discuss the bank’s top management after shareholders
criticized the leadership of Chief Executive Officer  Alessandro Profumo , two people with knowledge of the matter said.  
 Recent Libyan investments in Milan-based UniCredit have
triggered opposition from some members of Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s government, in addition to some banking foundations
which are shareholders of Italy’s biggest bank.  
 “There’s a power struggle between the top management and
the banking foundations who claim that Profumo is managing the
bank by himself without being influenced by them,” said  Wolfram Mrowetz , who oversees 200 million euros ($261 million) as head
of investment firm Alisei SIM in Milan. “The entrance of the
Libyans makes the foundations afraid of losing more power and
they blame Profumo for this.”  
 UniCredit investor Fondazione CRT wants to review the
performance of the 53-year-old Profumo at the bank’s next
shareholder meeting, CRT Chairman  Andrea Comba  told Corriere
della Sera in an article published today.  
 The planned board meeting was reported earlier today by
Italian news agency Ansa. A UniCredit official declined to
comment. The “most likely scenario” is that Profumo will step
down and Chairman  Dieter Rampl  will temporarily assume the CEO
duties, news agency Radiocor reported, without saying where it
got the information.  
 Boosting Stake  
 The Libyan Investment Authority increased its stake in
UniCredit to 2.6 percent from 2.1 percent as of Aug. 31,
according to filings posted on market regulator Consob’s website
today. The Central Bank of Libya is “extremely satisfied” with
its investment in UniCredit, according to an e-mailed statement
today. The central bank holds almost 5 percent of UniCredit.  
 UniCredit’s board originally had been scheduled to meet
Sept. 30 to discuss the matter and send a response to Italian
regulators seeking information about the whether the two Libyan
investors were acting independently. UniCredit’s bylaws restrict
investor voting rights to 5 percent.  
 Libyan investors chose “autonomously” to buy the stakes
in UniCredit, Profumo told reporters in Milan Sept. 6. The bank
is strengthening its ties to Libya as  Berlusconi  fosters trade
relations with the country, led by  Muammar Qaddafi . The Central
Bank of Libya assigned a banking license to UniCredit last
month, making it the first foreign bank allowed to operate in
the country.
