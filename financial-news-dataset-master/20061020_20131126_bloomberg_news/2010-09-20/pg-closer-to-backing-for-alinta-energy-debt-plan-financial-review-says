             TPG Capital’s plan for Alinta
Energy Ltd., the Australian power generation company seeking to
shed debt, is closer to obtaining support, the Australian
Financial Review reported, without saying where it got the
information.  
 The private equity firm altered its original proposal,
including a demand for additional equity, the newspaper said.
Lenders moved away from a proposal from Bahrain’s Arcapita,
which made an offer worth about A$2 billion, the newspaper said.
