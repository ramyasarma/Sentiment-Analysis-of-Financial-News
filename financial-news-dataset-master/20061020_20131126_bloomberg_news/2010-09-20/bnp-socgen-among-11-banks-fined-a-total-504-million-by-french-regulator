             BNP Paribas SA ,  Groupe Credit
Agricole , BPCE SA and eight other banks were fined a total of
384.9 million euros ($504 million) after France’s competition
regulator said an electronic check-processing program improperly
levied fees on consumers.  
 BPCE, France’s second-largest bank by branches, was fined
90.9 million euros, the largest penalty. Credit Agricole was
fined 82.9 million, the  Autorite de la Concurrence  said in a
 statement .  
 The banks set a 4.3 euro-cent charge to exchange check
images between lenders, one of nine interbank charges introduced
when they switched to electronic processing. The check image fee
was charged from January 2002 to July 2007, and only lifted
“under the pressure of the ongoing proceedings,” the regulator
said.  
 “The digitalizing of the clearing system has allowed banks
to make substantial savings,” the regulator said in its
statement. “Neither the firms, nor the consumer, have been able
to take full profit from this economic progress.”  
 BNP , France’s largest bank, was fined 63 million euros, and
Societe Generale SA 53 million euros. The Bank of France, which
supervises French banks, was fined 350,000 euros.  
 Christelle Maldague , a spokeswoman for Paris-based BNP,
said the check-processing program was “set up in full
transparency and in full visibility of the banking
authorities.”  
 French Checks  
 People in France wrote the most checks of any country using
the euro. They accounted for 78 percent of the checks in the
region in 2006, the  Autorite de la Concurrence  said today in
Paris, making the service fees introduced when the banks
switched to electronic processing of checks from manual more
remunerative. The fees led to an additional 220 million euros
charged to customers, the regulator said.  
 The banks were also fined for two other “related service”
fees, the agency said.  
 The other banks didn’t immediately comment on the decision.  
 The fine was raised by 10 percent for five banks that
played a bigger role at the outset and by 20 percent for six
lenders that were fined in 2000 for operating a separate cartel.
