             Peermont Global Ltd. will challenge
the awarding of a new casino licence in Botswana to Gold Reef
Resorts Ltd. in the high court, Business Day said, citing
Peermont Chief Executive Officer Anthony Puttergill.  
 Gold Reef is unware of any action against the Casino
Control Board of Botswana and the company is proceeding with its
plans, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Gold Reef CEO
Steven Joffe as saying.
