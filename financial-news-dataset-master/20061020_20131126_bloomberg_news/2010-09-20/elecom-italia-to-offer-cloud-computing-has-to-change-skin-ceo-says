             Telecom Italia SpA  said it’s
starting cloud-computing services for businesses and government
offices as Italy’s biggest phone company seeks more sources of
revenue.  
 “Telecom Italia can’t just be a carrier of bits, it needs
to change its skin in a radical way,” Chief Executive Officer
 Franco Bernabe  said at a press conference in Milan today.
“Telecom Italia wants to sell integrated services to companies,
not just connectivity.”  
 The new services will be available on demand and on a pay-
per-use basis, tapping the growing “cloud-sourced IT managed-
services market,” whose value is forecast to reach about 300
million euros ($390 million) in Italy in 2012, the Milan-based
company’s CEO said.  
 Telecom Italia , which is investing about 30 million euros
on the project, targets a share of 20 percent to 25 percent of
the domestic cloud-computing market, Bernabe said. The services
allow clients to bring down their IT costs and focus their
resources on their core businesses, he said. Cloud computing
allows clients to store data on external servers.  
 As part of the company’s effort to diversity its services,
Telecom Italia said in July it will offer banks software and
remote assistance for automatic teller machines, or ATMs. It’s
targeting a market that’s estimated to be worth more than 250
million euros in Italy and expected to grow 5 percent annually
in the next three years, the company said.
