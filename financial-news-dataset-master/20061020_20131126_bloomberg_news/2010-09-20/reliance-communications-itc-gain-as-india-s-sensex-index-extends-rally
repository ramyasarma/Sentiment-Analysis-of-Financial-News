             India’s benchmark stock index rose,
extending last week’s biggest rally in 10 months, as the
nation’s economic growth lured foreign investors to increase
their holdings.  
 Reliance Communications Ltd. , the nation’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, soared 5.3 percent. Foreign funds bought
more local shares than they sold for the past three weeks,
increasing their holdings this year by 57 percent from a year
earlier, a report from the regulator showed.  ITC Ltd. , the
biggest cigarette company, climbed to a 19-year high.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 311.35, or 1.6 percent, to 19,906.10, its highest close
since January 2008 after climbing 4.2 percent last week. The S&P
CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose 1.6 percent
to 5,980.45. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 1.3 percent to 2,527.22.  
 “It’s a liquidity-driven rally,” said  Sudhakar Shanbhag ,
who manages $1.7 billion in assets as chief investment officer
at Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Ltd. in Mumbai.
“India’s growth is a compelling story for global investors. We
are fully invested.” Shanbhag said he’s investing in shares of
automakers, drugmakers, large machinery makers, technology,
engineering and media companies, without identifying any.  
 Fund Flows  
 Reliance Communications advanced 5.3 percent to 175.65
rupees, extending its 5.4 percent climb on Sept. 17. ITC rose
4.9 percent to 176.65 rupees, its highest close since at least
January 1991.  
 Global  funds  bought a net  11.4 billion rupees  ($247 million)
of Indian equities on Sept. 16, taking total investments in the
stocks this year to 718.2 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 “At this pace” foreign inflows may cross last year’s
record, helping the Sensex cross the record of 20,873.33 reached
on Jan. 8, 2008, by December, said Kotak’s Shanbhag.  
 India’s gross domestic product expanded 8.8 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the most among major economies
after China and Brazil.  
 Rupee Gains  
 The rupee climbed to a three-month high on speculation
accelerating capital flows into the local stock market will
offset the nation’s record  current-account  deficit. The currency
appreciated in each of the last three weeks as foreigners bought
$2.6 billion more Indian equities than they sold this month,
exceeding the $2.4 billion the stock exchange recorded for the
whole of August.  
 “Capital inflows may surprise on the upside as India’s
economic prospects remain positive,” said  Priyanka Chakravarty ,
a Mumbai-based foreign-exchange strategist at Standard Chartered
Plc. “The rupee is poised to extend recent gains as sustained
portfolio investments may overwhelm trade deficit concerns.”  
 Voltas Ltd. , the Tata group engineering company, surged 4.3
percent to 236.3 rupees after it was rated “buy” in new
coverage at Nomura Holdings Inc., which said the company will
likely be a “key beneficiary” of increasing infrastructure and
industrial capital expenditure in India, the Middle East and
Southeast Asia. The brokerage has a share-price estimate of 270
rupees, according to a report by  Harmendra Gandhi .  
 IndusInd Bank Ltd.  gained 1.1 percent to 265.65 rupees
after being raised to “overweight” from “equal-weight” at
Morgan Stanley, which cited a “stronger” margin outlook. The
brokerage raised its share-price estimate to 325 rupees from 195
rupees, according to analysts led by  Mihir Sheth .
