             Gold rose to a record for the third
straight session on speculation that government programs to
stimulate the economy will erode the value of the dollar,
boosting demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  
 The dollar approached a five-week low against the euro. The
Federal Reserve may say at a meeting tomorrow that it’s
considering more measures to keep borrowing costs low.
Confidence among homebuilders in September held at the weakest
level in more than a year, indicating the housing market remains
depressed.  
 “The longer we continue with no real change in the U.S.
economic situation, the more likely we’ll get another round of
quantitative easing,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago. “The underlying loose
monetary policies will erode the value of the currency against
gold.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery rose $3.30, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,280.80 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached a record
$1,285.20.  
 Gold for immediate delivery climbed to an all-time high of
$1,283.80. Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold
advanced to a record on Sept. 17.  
 The Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and bought back
Treasuries to revive the economy.  
 10-Year Rally  
 Gold on the Comex has climbed 17 percent this year,
outperforming global equities, Treasuries and most industrial
metals. Futures headed for the 10th straight annual gain.  
 The Fed is likely to affirm its pledge to keep interest
rates low for an “extended period” and maintain the floor on
its holdings of securities, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment dropped to a one-year low of 66.6,
figures showed Sept. 17.  
 “The only thing that can bring gold down is a real
improvement in the economy,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader
at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “People will dump it for
higher-risk assets.”  
 Gold gained this year amid tame U.S. inflation. The metal
is traditionally bought as a hedge against rising consumer
prices. Inflation expectations, based on the  10-year  U.S.
Treasury breakeven rate, have fallen to 1.79 percent from 2.21
percent six months ago.  
 The 14-day relative-strength index for gold futures has
been above 70 since Sept. 16, a signal to some traders that the
price is poised to fall.  
 ‘Susceptible to Correction’  
 “I’m a weak long at these levels,” McGhee of Integrated
Brokerage said. “Gold is at the top of a very long run and
susceptible to a correction.”  
 Silver futures for December delivery fell 1.3 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $20.803 an ounce. On Sept. 17, the metal settled at
$20.816, the highest closing price for a most-active contract
since 1980.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery gained $10.10, or 0.6
percent, to $1,632 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price was up for the sixth straight session, the longest
rally in six months.  
 Palladium futures for December delivery fell $3.85, or 0.7
percent, to $541.85 an ounce.
