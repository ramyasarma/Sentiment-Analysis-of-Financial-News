             South African President Jacob Zuma
said businesses should invest in political parties to boost
democracy and promote stability.  
 There is “nothing wrong with the business sector investing
in any party,” Zuma said in a copy of a speech presented
yesterday at a dinner hosted by the ruling African National
Congress. “However, wise business sense tells you that
investing in the ANC, which is supported by more than 
sixty five percent of the population, is good value for your
money!”  
 Business thrives in a stable, secure environment, he said.
“As much as business would invest in building infrastructure or
human resource development, investing in democracy is also
healthy as it provides a stable environment in which to do 
business.”
