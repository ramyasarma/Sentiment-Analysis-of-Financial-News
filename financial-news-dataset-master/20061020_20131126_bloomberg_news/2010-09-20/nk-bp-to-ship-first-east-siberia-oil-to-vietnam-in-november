             TNK-BP  agreed to supply the first
shipment of oil to Vietnam from the East Siberia Pacific Ocean
pipeline as the venture, half-owned by BP Plc, seeks to expand
international operations.  
 TNK-BP will ship 100,000 metric tons of ESPO crude blend in
November under a contract signed today with Vietnam Oil & Gas
Group, known as PetroVietnam, the Moscow-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  
 “We are committed to establishing a long-term presence in
Vietnam and to pursuing joint projects in the upstream and
refining sectors,” TNK-BP Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Maxim Barsky  said in the statement.  
 Russian oil companies are seeking to expand overseas to
boost output as traditional western Siberian fields age and the
government limits tax relief for producers developing remote new
areas.  
 Billionaire  Mikhail Fridman , a TNK-BP shareholder and its
interim chief executive officer, said last week that he would
like to have TNK-BP’s international projects account for at
least half of its total production eventually.  
 TNK-BP is considering buying BP projects in Vietnam, among
other countries, as the British company sells $30 billion of
assets over the next 18 months to help cover the costs of the
Gulf of Mexico spill.  
 BP may sell a stake in the Nam Con Son gas project in the
Southeast Asian nation. Talks to buy assets in Vietnam and
Venezuela are furthest along, TNK-BP Chief Financial Officer
 Jonathan Muir  said in an interview last week.  
 Last month, TNK-BP signed a memorandum of understanding
with PetroVietnam to create a Russian venture and expand the
Dung Quat refinery’s capacity.
