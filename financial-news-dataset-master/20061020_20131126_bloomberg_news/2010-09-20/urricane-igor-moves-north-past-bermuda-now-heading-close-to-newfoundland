             Hurricane Igor, which has battered
Bermuda with high winds and heavy rains the past day, is now 135
miles north of Bermuda bearing 75 mph winds. It’s moving north-
northeast at 20 mph on a course that may take it close to
Newfoundland’s southeastern coast, the National Hurricane Center
said today. Canada issued a tropical storm watch for the
Newfoundland coast, the center said today in its latest
advisory.
