              DuPont Co., the third-biggest U.S.
chemical maker, sold $2 billion of notes in a three-part
offering, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  
 A $500 million portion of five-year notes yields 72 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1 billion of 10-
year debt pays a 93 basis-point spread and $500 million of 30-
year bonds pay 112.5 basis points more than benchmarks, said the
person, who declined to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly on the sale. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  
 Dow Chemical Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp. are the two largest
U.S. chemical makers by sales.
