             General Motors Co.,  which is making
 plans  to sell its stock to the public, has made its first
campaign contributions since 2008,  Federal Election Commission 
reports show.  
 Detroit-based GM, 61 percent owned by the U.S. Treasury,
resumed donations through its political action committee,
according to the company’s August FEC report, and has given
$91,500 to candidates of both political parties. The PAC
contributed $710,008 for the 2008 elections.  
 “Emerging as a new company, we are participating in the
political process,” said  Greg Martin , a GM spokesman. “We will
not sit on the sidelines while our competitors in other
industries have their voices heard.”  
 Among those receiving GM contributions were Representative
 Eric Cantor  of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, and the
leadership PAC of House Majority Leader  Steny Hoyer , a Maryland
Democrat.  
 GM emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009 and received a $50
billion taxpayer bailout. The company is seeking to raise as
much as $16 billion through its initial public offering.
