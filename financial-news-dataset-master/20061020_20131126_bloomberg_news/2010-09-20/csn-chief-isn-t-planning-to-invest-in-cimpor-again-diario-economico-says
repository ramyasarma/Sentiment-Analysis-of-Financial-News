             Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA, a
Brazilian steelmaker, isn’t planning to invest in Cimpor-
Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA after making a failed takeover bid
for that company earlier this year, Diario Economico reported,
citing CSN Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Steinbruch.   
 Lisbon-based Cimpor is Portugal’s biggest cement company.
