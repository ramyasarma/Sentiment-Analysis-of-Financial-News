             A former General Motors Co. metals
manager was banned from trading commodities after bilking the
automaker of $6.5 million through unauthorized aluminum
transactions, according to  U.S. regulators .  
 Daniel J. Bealko, the former global commodity manager for
lightweight metals at Detroit-based GM, pleaded guilty to one
count of wire fraud and one count of income-tax evasion on Nov.
5, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said today in
an e-mailed statement.  
 Bealko, who devised and implemented GM’s aluminum-hedging
strategies between 1996 and 2003, used the commodity markets to
defraud GM by “knowingly engaging in unauthorized futures and
options trading” from June 2003 to Dec. 7, 2003, the agency
said.  
 Without GM’s knowledge or consent, Bealko “sold New York
Mercantile Exchange aluminum-futures contracts and options on
NYMEX aluminum-futures contracts to personally profit from GM’s
divesture of surplus aluminum,” the CFTC said. The transactions
resulted in a gain of about $6.5 million, according to the
agency.  
 Bealko, formerly of Clarkston, Michigan, is currently in
federal custody after he was sentenced to 70 months in prison
and ordered to pay full restitution to GM, the CFTC said. He was
banned permanently from trading, according to a commission order
that was entered today.  
 GM declined comment, spokesman  Tom Wilkinson  said in an e-
mail today.
