             A majority of likely voters supports
Democrat  Andrew Cuomo  in his bid for New York governor against
Republican  Carl Paladino , a Rasmussen Reports poll shows.  
 Fifty-four percent of likely voters favor Cuomo, the
state’s attorney general, compared with 38 percent for Paladino,
 Rasmussen Reports  said today. It’s the first survey of the
state’s governor’s race the polling group has conducted since
the Sept. 14 primaries.  
 “This is Paladino’s best showing yet,” Rasmussen Reports
said. “It remains to be seen whether this is a short-lived
post-primary bounce or a tightening of the race that Cuomo has
dominated for months.”  
 Paladino, a Tea Party supporter and developer from Buffalo,
holds a “slight lead” over Cuomo among unaffiliated voters,
Rasmussen said. Almost two-thirds of Republicans in the state
support him.  
 The telephone survey of 500 likely voters was taken Sept.
16. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage
points.
