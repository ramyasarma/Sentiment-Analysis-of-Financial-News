             Canada’s dollar gained versus its
U.S. counterpart for the first time in three days as stocks and
gold climbed and investors sought higher-yielding assets.  
 The currency, known as the loonie for the bird’s image on
the dollar coin, capped its third consecutive weekly advance on
Sept. 17. The yield  gap  in Canadian 2-year bonds over
equivalent-maturity Treasuries reached 105 basis points last
week, the most since July 15.  
 The Canadian dollar “has been saved from weakness due to
yields,”  Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist in Toronto at
Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit, said via e-mail.
“The most important macro-financial driver of the Canadian
dollar in its September rally has been the U.S.-Canada yield
differential.”  
 The Canadian currency strengthened 0.5 percent to C$1.0282
per U.S. dollar at 4:21 p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0330
on Sept. 17. One Canadian dollar buys 97.26 U.S. cents.  
 Canada’s benchmark two-year bond yields increased 4 basis
points today at 1.51 percent, as the price of the 2 percent
security due in September 2012 fell 8 cents at C$100.93. Two-
year Treasuries yielded 0.46 percent. The gap has expanded on
speculation the  Bank of Canada  may keep raising interest rates
while the Fed holds its target rate unchanged.  
 Spread Support  
 The widening spread “reflects the improved monetary policy
sentiment for Canada,” Tihanyi said. The wider spread is
“supportive for the Canadian dollar,” he said.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.5 percent in New
York. Gold futures rose to a record for the third straight
session on speculation that government programs to stimulate the
economy will erode the value of the U.S. dollar. Gold futures
for December delivery reached a record $1,285.20.  
 Canada’s currency tends to rise and fall with stocks and
raw-materials prices.  
 Net buying by foreign investors of Canadian  bonds , equities
and money market securities rose in July, with purchases
totaling C$5.48 billion ($5.32 billion) in the month, compared
with C$5.39 billion in June, Ottawa-based Statistics Canada said
today. Non-residents bought C$5.17 billion of bonds, the 19th
consecutive monthly net purchase for such securities.  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  has increased interest
rates three times since June, to 1 percent from 0.25 percent,
and said Sept. 14 the country’s recovery will be “slightly more
gradual” than expected earlier this year.  
 Economists in a Bloomberg survey predict the central bank’s
key overnight rate will rise to 1.5 percent by mid-2011,
according to the weighted average. The Federal Reserve will keep
its rate at 0.25 percent until the third quarter next year, a
separate survey showed.
