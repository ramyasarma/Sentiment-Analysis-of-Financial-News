             Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the
investment bank liquidating in bankruptcy, will spend a total of
$1.6 billion to save its two banks, Aurora Bank FSB and
Woodlands Commercial Bank, from being seized by regulators,
according to a court filing today.  
 The number includes past and future contributions to the
banks, whose equity Lehman valued at $1.4 billion.  
 Lehman said this month it would close or sell the banks. By
spending the money it aims to save creditors from potential
priority claims of $2.7 billion and recoup an estimated
liquidation value of $2 billion, according to the filing.
