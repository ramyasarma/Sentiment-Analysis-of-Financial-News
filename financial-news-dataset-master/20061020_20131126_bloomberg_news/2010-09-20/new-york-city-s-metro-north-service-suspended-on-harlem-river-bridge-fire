             Service on the Hudson, Harlem and
New Haven lines of New York’s Metro-North railroad has been
suspended up to the 138th Street bridge over the Harlem River
because of a fire, a spokeswoman for the line said.  
 Commuters seeking to leave Manhattan should take the subway
system’s D train or 4 train to 161st Street, then walk west to
the Yankees E. 153 Street station,  Marjorie Anders , a
spokeswoman for the Metro-North service, said in a telephone
interview.  
 The fire under the bridge was reported at 11:45 a.m. today
and may have been started by the explosion of a transformer
adjacent to the track, Anders said. The blast set fire to wooden
pilings intended to protect against damage from boat traffic,
she said.  
 Transit officials don’t yet know whether the explosion
damaged the bridge’s metal structure, Anders said.
