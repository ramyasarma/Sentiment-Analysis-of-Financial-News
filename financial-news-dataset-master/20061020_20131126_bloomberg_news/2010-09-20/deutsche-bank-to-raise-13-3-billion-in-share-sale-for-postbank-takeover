Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s largest
bank, will raise about 10.2 billion euros ($13.3 billion) in
Europe’s biggest rights offer this year to acquire  Deutsche
Postbank AG  and increase reserves.  The bank plans to sell 308.6 million new shares for 33
euros apiece in Germany and the U.S., the company said in a
statement yesterday. That’s 30 percent less than yesterday’s
closing price in Frankfurt. Shareholders will be able to
purchase one new share for every two they own.  Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  is planning the
company’s biggest-ever share sale to finance a takeover offer
for Postbank, which would boost the firm’s retail clients to 24
million in Germany. The funds will also help Deutsche Bank
fulfill new regulatory requirements by the end of 2013,
Ackermann said last week.  “Deutsche Bank intends to secure the equity capital
required for a planned consolidation of Postbank,” Ackermann,
62, said in a statement yesterday. “With this capital increase
we are strengthening the bank’s equity capital in light of
expected regulatory changes and business growth.”  Deutsche Bank rose 17 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 47.05 euros
by 9:36 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. The stock has  declined  4.8
percent this year, valuing the company at 29.2 billion euros.
Postbank gained 0.8 percent to 25.10 euros, giving the company a
market value of 5.5 billion euros.  Postbank Offer  Deutsche Bank said on Sept. 12 that it would raise at least
9.8 billion euros, at a preliminary subscription price of 31.80
euros. The company plans to publish a prospectus today.  Deutsche Bank said at the time the offer is fully
underwritten by a group of banks including UBS AG, Banco
Santander SA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Commerzbank AG,
HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG, ING Groep NV, Morgan Stanley and
Societe Generale SA.  The German bank plans to offer 25 euros a share in cash to
Postbank investors to increase its 29.95 percent stake. Deutsche
Bank will likely boost its stake in Postbank to about 60 percent
if minority shareholders accept the offer.  The German firm agreed to buy a stake in Postbank in
September 2008 from  Deutsche Post AG  and then renegotiated the
transaction in January 2009 after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. roiled financial markets. Deutsche Bank
also holds a mandatory exchangeable bond for a 27.4 percent
stake and an option to buy Deutsche Post’s remaining 12.1
percent stake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
