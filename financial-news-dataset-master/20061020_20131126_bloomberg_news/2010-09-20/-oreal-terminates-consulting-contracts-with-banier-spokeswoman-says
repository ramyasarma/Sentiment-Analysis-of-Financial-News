             L’Oreal SA  has ended all contracts
with Francois-Marie Banier, a photographer and author who has
been accused of allegedly manipulating the cosmetics maker’s
largest shareholder into giving him gifts worth 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion).  
 L’Oreal has terminated the contracts because media
attention to Banier “was such that their continuation would
have been damaging for L’Oreal,”  Stephanie Carson-Parker , a
spokeswoman for the Paris-based company, said by e-mail.  
 Pierre Cornut-Gentille, a lawyer for Banier, declined to
comment on the ending of contracts.  
 L’Oreal heiress  Liliane Bettencourt ’s daughter has pursued
a private prosecution of Banier, saying he manipulated her
87-year-old mother, who owns 31 percent of the world’s largest
cosmetics maker.  
 Paris prosecutors have also been investigating a complaint
by a L’Oreal investor about an artistic consulting contract the
company had with Banier that originally expired in 2011. The
July 5 complaint alleged that the 405,000 euros-a-year deal was
a misuse of company funds, the investor’s lawyer said July 20.  
 Banier offered a “genuine service” to L’Oreal, Chief
Executive  Jean-Paul Agon  said in August, adding that claims to
the contrary were “unfounded.”
