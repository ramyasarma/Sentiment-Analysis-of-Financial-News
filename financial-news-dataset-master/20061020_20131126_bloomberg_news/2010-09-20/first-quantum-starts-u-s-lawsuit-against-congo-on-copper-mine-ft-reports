             First Quantum Minerals Ltd., a
Canadian mining company, will extend legal proceedings against
the Democratic Republic of Congo over the nationalization of the
Frontier copper mine, the Financial Times reported, citing  Clive Newall , First Quantum’s president.  
 The company will start an action at the International
Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington DC,
the newspaper said.  
 First Quantum has already started litigation against the
Democratic Republic of Congo in Paris over the seizure of its
Kolwezi copper tailings project and last week it said it’s suing
a unit of Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. in the British Virgin
Islands for buying Kolwezi last month, the FT added.
