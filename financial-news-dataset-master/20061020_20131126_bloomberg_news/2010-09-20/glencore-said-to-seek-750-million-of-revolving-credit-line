             Glencore International AG, the
world’s biggest commodities trader, is seeking $750 million of
loans for stand-by credit and guarantees, a person familiar with
the situation said.  
 ING Groep NV is arranging the one-year revolving credit for
Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the deal is private.  Marc Ocskay , a
spokesman for Glencore, declined to comment.  
 The company said last month first-half profit jumped 42
percent to $1.56 billion on rebounding metals demand and prices.
Glencore, which trades oil, metals and agricultural commodities
and controls mines and smelters on five continents, agreed on
$10.2 billion of credit in May, its largest syndicated loan,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Glencore’s cash and undrawn credit facilities totaled $6.5
billion as of June 30, it said last month. That’s above an
internal minimum target of $3 billion, it said. Net debt
increased to $13.6 billion, from $10.2 billion at the end of
December.
