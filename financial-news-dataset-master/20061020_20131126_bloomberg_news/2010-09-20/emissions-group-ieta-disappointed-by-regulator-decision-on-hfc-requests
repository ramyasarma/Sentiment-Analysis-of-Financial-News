             The International Emissions Trading
Association said it was “disappointed” by the United Nations
carbon market regulator’s decision to review all requests for
issuance of credits linked to hydrofluorocarbons.  
 “This decision will certainly have an impact on the market
over the short-term, but any long-term impact will be determined
by the Board’s decision at its 58th meeting,” IETA said in an
e-mailed statement. “It could be that after that date, all of
the issuances that are currently postponed are processed. We
have no choice but to wait and see.”  
 The Clean Development Mechanism executive board said in a
report after its meeting ended on Sept. 17 that it would decide
at its 58th meeting in November about the methodology of
awarding credits for cutting industrial gas HFC-23.  
 While the IETA was “slightly encouraged” by the promise
of a resolution in November and maintained its support for the
board’s commitment to conduct a thorough analysis, it does not
believe that requests for review should be used to look into “a
general concern like this one,” according to the statement.
