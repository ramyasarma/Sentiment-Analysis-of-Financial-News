             New South Wales is set to become
the first Australian state to introduce campaign finance reform
limiting election spending and political donations, the
Australian Financial Review reported, without citing anyone.  
 The state government led by Premier Kristina Keneally is
seeking to put the reforms into effect by the March election,
setting a A$5,000 cap on donations to parties and a A$2,000 cap
on donations to candidates, the newspaper said. The state
cabinet approved the reforms yesterday, the Review said.
