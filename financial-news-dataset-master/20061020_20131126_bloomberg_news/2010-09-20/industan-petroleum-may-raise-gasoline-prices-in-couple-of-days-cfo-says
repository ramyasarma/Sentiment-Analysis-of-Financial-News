             Hindustan Petroleum Corp. , India’s
third-largest state oil refiner, may increase gasoline prices in
a couple of days,  B. Mukherjee , director of finance, said by
telephone today.  
 Mukherjee commented after CNBC television reported that
Indian Oil Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum would raise gasoline
prices by as much as 0.28 rupee a liter, without saying where it
got the information.  
 Hindustan Petroleum shares gained 2.2 percent to 544.25
rupees in Mumbai trading today, the highest level since Sept. 14.
Indian Oil, the nation’s biggest state refiner, climbed 2.9
percent to 441.10 rupees, a record. Bharat Petroleum Corp. rose
4.7 percent to a record 802.15 rupees.  
 India’s government freed gasoline pricing on June 25 to cut
fuel subsidies and limit losses of state-run refiners. The
government said then diesel prices would eventually be freed
from state control.  
 The refiners will review the need to revise gasoline prices
every month, Serangulam V. Narasimhan, finance director at
Indian Oil, said July 14. Narasimhan was unable to comment
immediately when reached on his mobile phone today.
