             Russian banks are selling the most
bonds on international markets for any year since the government
defaulted in 1998 as a rebounding economy helps push down
borrowing costs.  
 Offerings by  OAO Sberbank  and Alfa Bank last week brought
total overseas debt sales by lenders in 2010 to $12.1 billion,
or 78 percent of all foreign issues by Russian companies and the
most by financial firms since Bloomberg began tracking the data
in 1999. Sberbank’s $1 billion of debt was priced to yield 5.4
percent, the lowest the nation’s biggest lender has paid on
dollar bonds, while Alfa Bank securities were priced to yield
7.875 percent versus more than 9 percent in a June 2008 sale.  
 Dollar loan demand increased the past six months as the
economy expanded by more than 5 percent after its worst slump on
record, Sberbank’s Chief Executive Officer  German Gref  told
reporters in Sochi on Sept. 16. The  extra yield  investors
require to own Russian debt over U.S. Treasuries has fallen 640
basis points to 220 since the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. two years ago caused global credit markets to
seize up, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ Index shows.  
 “After the crisis the Russian banks were cut from
international financing for quite some time,”  Alexei Tretyakov ,
director of the financial markets at Moscow-based Nomos Bank,
said in an e-mail on Sept. 17. “It wasn’t until this year that
credit spreads returned to pre-crisis levels and made borrowing
terms comfortable.”  
 Nomos Bank  
 Nomos Bank sold $350 million of 8.75 percent dollar-
denominated bonds in April that mature in 2015. The securities
are yielding 8.03 percent today, down from a high of 10.74
percent in May.  
 Russian bonds yield more than lower-rated securities from
Brazil and Colombia compared with Treasuries. Investors demand
199 basis points, or 1.99 percentage point, more yield to own
Brazilian dollar bonds rather than Treasuries and 154 more to
own Colombian bonds. Both countries’ debt carry BBB- ratings
from Standard & Poor’s, one level lower than Russia’s BBB.  
 Russia’s gross domestic product expanded 5.2 percent in the
second quarter, after shrinking 11 percent in the same period a
year earlier, the worst contraction since records began in 1995,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Bank lending will probably grow 15 percent this year after
retail loans shrank 11 percent in 2009, central bank Chairman
 Sergey Ignatiev  told lawmakers in July.  
 1998 Default  
 Russian banks are stepping up international borrowing after
the government sold its first Eurobond in April since defaulting
on $40 billion of domestic debt in August 1998, with an offer of
$5.5 billion of five-year and 10-year dollar securities. Yields
on Russian  corporate bonds  dropped as much as 178 basis points
since May 25 to a record low 5.57 percent on Aug. 19.  
 Sberbank, Alfa Bank and VTB Group, the country’s second-
biggest bank, top the list of 12 lenders selling foreign debt
this year, accounting for the biggest share of corporate foreign
borrowing on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Financial institutions accounted for 24 percent of last year’s
$11.6 billion of international offerings from Russia.  
 Sberbank sold $1 billion of debt due in March 2017 on Sept.
17, while Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in the country,
raised $1 billion from seven-year bonds. Both lenders are based
in Moscow.  
 Falling Yields  
 The yield on Russia’s dollar bond due in 2015 fell 4 basis
points to 3.563 percent today, narrowing the difference with
U.S. Treasury yields to 212, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The spread reached a peak of 318 basis points in May.
The price of its ruble notes due November 2014 increased 1 basis
point to 6.85 percent.  
 The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps increased 2 basis points
to 163.5 today, according to data provider CMA. The contracts
pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying
securities or the cash equivalent should a government or company
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  
 Credit-default swaps for Russia, rated Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, its third-lowest investment grade rating,
cost 1 basis point more than the contracts for Turkey, which is
rated four levels lower at Ba2. Russia swaps  cost  as much as 40
basis points less on April 20.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points to 218,
according to JPMorgan EMBI+ indexes. The difference compares
with 152 for debt of similarly rated Mexico.  
 Forwards  
 The  yield   spread  on Russian bonds is 60 basis points below
the average for emerging markets, down from a 15-month high of
105 in February, according to JPMorgan indexes.  
 The ruble was little changed at 30.9798 per dollar by 11:57
a.m. in Moscow trading, after rebounding from its weakest level
since three months on Sept. 20. Non-deliverable forwards, or
NDFs, which provide a guide to expectations of currency
movements and interest rate differentials and allow companies to
hedge against currency movements, show the ruble at 31.1963 per
dollar in three months.  
 Traders increased bets that the ruble will depreciate by
the most in four months last week on prospects for accelerating
inflation. The one-week risk-reversal rate against the dollar --
the premium of put options over calls -- was 2 percent on Sept.
17, from 1 percent a week earlier.  
 Managing currency swings may be boosting demand for foreign
currency in addition to “growing demand from the corporate
sector for dollar loans,”  Dmitry Dudkin , a fixed-income analyst
at UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow, wrote in an e-mail on
Sept. 17.  
 Currency Risk  
 “Currency risk is the core business of banks as opposed to
corporates,” Dudkin said. Banks are likely to maintain their
lead over non-financial borrowers for the rest of the year as
ruble borrowing remains relatively cheap, he said.  
 Sberbank has sold $2.5 billion of dollar debt this year,
which includes $1.5 billion of bonds sold in July, priced to
yield 369 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. The yield on
Sberbank’s 2015 bonds is little changed at 4.852 percent today.  
 The state-controlled bank agreed last month to lend $4.59
billion to United Co. Rusal to refinance an emergency loan from
Vnesheconombank. Rusal borrowed from VEB, the state-development
bank, in November 2008 to pay back foreign lenders that helped
it finance a purchase of 25 percent of OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel.  
 Putin Aid  
 The government has issued more than 2 trillion rubles ($64
billion) in emergency loans to banks to help the domestic
financial industry overcome the crisis, Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin told an investment forum in Sochi on Sept. 17.  
 VTB, based in Moscow, has offered more than $1.9 billion in
foreign-currency debt this year, including last month’s sale of
400 million Singapore dollars ($299 million) in three-year bonds
and 400 million Swiss francs ($396 million) of debt due in 2012.  
 The difference between the yield on VTB’s five-year dollar
bonds sold in March and Treasuries has dropped to 444 basis
points from a peak of 582, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The debt was priced to yield 412 basis points over
Treasuries.  
 Alfa Bank, rated Ba1 by Moody’s, the highest non-investment
grade, issued $1.6 billion in dollar debt this year. The yield
on its 2015 bond is little changed at 7.25 percent today, with
difference versus Treasuries widening 2 basis points to 597. The
spread peaked at 745 basis points in May.  
 Russian banks trimmed their total foreign-currency
obligations including bonds and loans 38 percent since October
2008 to $122.8 billion in July 2010, while non-financial
companies cut total debt 4.3 percent to $293.8 billion in the
same period, according to central bank data.  
 Financial firms were more active cutting foreign-currency
exposure than non-banks during the credit crisis and are now
“gradually recovering their positions,”  Alexander Kudrin , the
head of fixed-income research in Moscow at Troika Dialog,
Russia’s oldest investment bank, wrote in an e-mail response to
questions on Sept. 17.
