             The government should be allowed to
continue funding embryonic stem-cell research while it appeals a
lower court order banning the programs, the Justice Department
said in a court filing.  
 “Disruption of ongoing research will result in irreparable
setbacks and, in many cases, may destroy a project altogether,”
the department wrote in a filing today with the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington. Arguments are set for Sept. 27.  
 The appeals court said on Sept. 9 the government can keep
funding embryonic stem-cell research at least in the initial
stages of its challenge to a judge’s ban on taxpayer support for
any activity using cells taken from human embryos. The Justice
Department argued that District Judge  Royce Lamberth ’s order
cutting off funding would cause irreversible harm to
researchers, taxpayers and scientific progress.  
 Foes of U.S. funding for embryonic stem-cell research said
a ban won’t have any permanent impact on the research and should
remain in effect while the federal government appeals. U.S.
arguments are “speculation, misinformation, and hyperbole,”
the opponents, adult stem-cell researchers competing for funds,
said in legal papers filed last week.  
 The case is Sherley v. Sebelius, 10-5287, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington).
