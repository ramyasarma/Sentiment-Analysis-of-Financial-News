             President  Barack Obama  said the
economic recession remains “very real” for those Americans
still out of work.  
 “It’s still very real for them,” the president said
during an hour-long town-hall discussion on jobs and the economy
broadcast on CNBC television from the Newseum in Washington.
“The challenge is the hole was so deep, a lot of them are still
having a hard time,” he said.  
 The programs his administration put in place to stabilize
the economy worked, the president said.  
 Obama was asked if he has “vilified” business as he has
backed reforms for the financial industry.  
 “Businesses were crying that we do something” to help the
economy when he took office, he said. “As a consequence of
reckless decisions that had been made, the economy was on the
verge of collapse.”  
 “We instituted those changes” and “the financial markets
are now stabilized,” the president said. He said his
administration instituted approximately 50 tax cuts to help
business.  
 He also said that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and
White House economic adviser  Lawrence Summers  are doing “an
outstanding job.”
