             Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ,
the world’s largest producer of its namesake crop nutrient, said
its Cory mine returned to normal after a bomb threat yesterday
prompted evacuation of the site.  
 Investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
concluded that the telephone threat was a hoax, Bill Johnson, a
spokesman for the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based fertilizer
producer, said today in an interview.  
 “We’ve returned to normal operations,” said Johnson, who
declined to comment on potential motives. “The call was deemed
to be a hoax.”  
 Potash is the focus of a $40 billion unsolicited takeover
bid from Melbourne-based BHP Billiton Ltd.  
 The Cory mine is located near the community of Vanscoy,
Saskatchewan, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) southwest of
Saskatoon.
