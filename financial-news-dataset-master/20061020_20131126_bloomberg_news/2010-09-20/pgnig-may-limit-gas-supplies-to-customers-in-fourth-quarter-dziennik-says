             Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA, Poland’s dominant gas company, may limit
supplies to customers in the fourth quarter, Dziennik Gazeta
Prawna reported, citing company documents.
  Gornictwo may cut deliveries if the Polish and Russian
governments don’t agree on extending a gas contract, the
newspaper said. Gornictwo may lack 2.5 billion cubic meters of
gas this year, Dziennik added.
