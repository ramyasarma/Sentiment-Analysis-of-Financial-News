             The premium of United Nations
emission credits for 2010 over 2011 widened after the regulator
said it wouldn’t decide on how to deal with projects seeking
credits from destroying hydrofluorocarbons until November.  
 The Clean Development Mechanism executive board said in a
report after its meeting ended on Sept. 17 that it would decide
at its 58th meeting in November about the methodology of
awarding credits for cutting the industrial gas HFC-23. The
board hasn’t approved issuance of credits to HFC-destroying
projects since June 2.  
 The spread, traded as a separate contract on the European
Climate Exchange in London, jumped 15 percent to 70 euro cents
(91 cents) a metric ton. It was at a record 73 cents on Sept. 7.
