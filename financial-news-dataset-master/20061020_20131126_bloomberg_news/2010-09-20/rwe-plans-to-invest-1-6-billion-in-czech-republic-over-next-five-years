             RWE AG , Germany’s second-biggest
utility, said it plans to invest 30 billion koruna ($1.6
billion) in the next five years to expand its operations in the
Czech Republic.  
 The company will expand its underground storage space,
improve the Czech Republic’s pipeline connections with Poland
and Austria, and finish the construction of the Gazela pipeline
in the north of the country, Martin Chalupsky, spokesman for
RWE’s Czech unit, said in a telephone interview.  
 RWE has already started to expand underground gas-storage
units in the towns of Tranovice and Tvrdonice, which should be
finished in 2012, Chalupsky said. It is also building a steam-
gas production plant in Mochov, he added.
