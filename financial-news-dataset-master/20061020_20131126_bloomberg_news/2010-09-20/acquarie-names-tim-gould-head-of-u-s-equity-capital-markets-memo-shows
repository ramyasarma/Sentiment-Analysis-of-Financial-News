             Macquarie Group Ltd. , the
Australian bank that bought Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia
Waller LLC last year, named  Tim Gould  head of U.S. equity
capital markets.  
 Gould, who joined the firm in 2008 after more than 20 years
at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., will also remain head of U.S.
equity syndicate, according to an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Rohini Pragasam , a spokeswoman for the firm,
confirmed the memo’s content. Gould replaces  Jim Rossman , who
left the firm in June.  
 Macquarie is the 30th-ranked underwriter of U.S. equity
offerings this year, up from 57th in 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sydney-based Macquarie generated $1.35
billion of revenue from the Americas for the year ended March
31, more than triple that of a year earlier.  
 Gould spent 10 years as head of Lehman’s U.S. equity
syndicate group, according to the memo. The memo was sent by  Rob Redmond , who runs the firm’s U.S. corporate-finance unit, and
 Graham Copley , head of U.S. equities.
