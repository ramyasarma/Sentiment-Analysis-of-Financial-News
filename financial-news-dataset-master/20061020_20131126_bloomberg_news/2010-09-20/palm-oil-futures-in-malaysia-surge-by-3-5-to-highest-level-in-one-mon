             Palm oil climbed to the highest
level in more than a month as concerns about weather disrupting
harvests prompted funds into buying commodities including corn,
cotton and soybeans.  
 December-delivery futures, the most-active contract, surged
as much 4 percent to 2,733 ringgit a metric ton ($880), the most
since it started trading on June 17, and were at 2,712 ringgit
at the midday break in trading. May-delivery futures climbed 4.3
percent to 7,642 yuan ($1,138) on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.  
 “There’s widespread buying in agriculture commodities in
anticipation of weather disrupting harvests,” said  Ryan Long , a
dealer at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Weather is
still an issue and may remain one for some more time.”  
 Corn surged to a two-year high in Chicago and soybeans rose
to the highest since June 2009 on concerns about the weather in
China and Canada, and as a prolonged drought slows planting in
Russia. Cotton futures exceeded $1 per pound in New York for the
first time since 1995 as demand outpaces supply.  
 Palm oil has rebounded 19 percent from an eight-month low
on July 7 on speculation that demand will increase from Asian
countries celebrating festivals and harvesting in Malaysia and
Indonesia will be disrupted in November and December should La
Nina cause flooding in growing areas.  
 “There are concerns of oilseeds, particularly soybeans,
losing out to grains as farmers rotate crops in Latin Amercia,”
said  Ben Santoso , an analyst at DBS Vickers (Singapore) Pte.
“Dry weather in Brazil is causing some strain ahead of soybean
planting next month.”  
 December-delivery soybean oil traded in Chicago added 2.2
percent to 43.24 cents a pound, the highest intraday price since
Aug. 16. November-delivery soybeans rose as much as 2.9 percent
to $10.995 a bushel, the highest price since June 12, 2009.  
 Hedge Funds  
 Speculative long positions in soybean futures outnumbered
short positions by 146,406 contracts on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the Washington-based commission said in its Commitments
of Traders report on Sept. 17.  
 Malaysia’s palm oil exports rose 5 percent in the first 20
days of September to 906,688 tons from 863,289 tons in the same
period in August, market surveyor Intertek said today. Exports
may reach 60 billion ringgit this year, up from 49.6 billion
ringgit in 2009, on higher prices and improving global demand,
the Business Times reported, citing Malaysian Palm Oil Council
Chief Executive Officer  Yusof Basiron .  
 “With the palm oil plantation entering peak-production
period, the stocks-to-user ratio is bound to rise,” DBS’ Santos
said. “The current rally may be temporary and in line with
general strength in soft commodities.”  
 CME Group Inc.’s December-delivery palm oil contract, which
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark, added as much as 2.8 percent
to $871.25 a ton in Singapore, the highest since the exchange
began trading the contract in May.
