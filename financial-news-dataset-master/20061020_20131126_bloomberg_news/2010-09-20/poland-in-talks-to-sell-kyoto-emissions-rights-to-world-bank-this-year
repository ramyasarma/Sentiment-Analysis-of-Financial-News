             Poland is in talks with the World
Bank and Japan on the sale of emissions rights under the Kyoto
Protocol, Environment Minister  Andrzej Kraszewski  said today.  
 The central European country has so far signed deals to
sell Assigned Amount Units, known as AAUs, worth 80 million
euros ($105 million) and reaching the target of 150 million
euros this year is “realistic,” Kraszewski told reporters in
Warsaw.  
 He also said any unilateral move by the European Union to a
deeper emission-reduction target would be “counter-
productive.” The EU said it may toughen its emissions-cut goal
to 30 percent from the current 20 percent if other countries
make comparable efforts. The bloc’s climate chief said the
conditions for a stricter goal have not been met.
