             Harvard University economics
professor  Martin Feldstein  said the Bush administration’s tax
cuts, including those for the wealthiest Americans, should be
extended for two years.  
 “We should extend all of the Bush tax cuts to two years
and we will have a clean slate and see where the economy is,”
Feldstein said today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “We should commit now to two
years -- and nothing beyond the two years.”
