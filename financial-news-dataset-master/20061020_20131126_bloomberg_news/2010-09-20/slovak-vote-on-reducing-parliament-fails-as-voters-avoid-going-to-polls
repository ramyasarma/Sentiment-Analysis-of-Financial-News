             Slovakia’s referendum on reducing
the number of lawmakers in Parliament and narrowing their legal
immunity failed as the turnout didn’t reach the required limit.  
 The Sept. 18 referendum, which was initiated by a coalition
member  Freedom and Solidarity , drew 998,142 citizens, or 22.8
percent of registered voters, the Slovak Statistical Office said
on its  website . To be valid, one-half of the country’s 4.4
million registered voters were required to vote.  
 The referendum also asked citizens whether they want to
eliminate compulsory monthly radio and television fees, allow
voting over the Internet, set a 40,000 euro ($50,292) price
limit for government car purchases and weaken the protection of
public servants from criticism in the press.  
 Of seven referendums held in the east European country
since it was created by a split from Czechoslovakia in 1993,
only a vote on European Union membership had the required
turnout to make the balloting valid.
