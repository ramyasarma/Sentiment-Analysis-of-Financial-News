             Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty said today a regularly scheduled review of banking
rules won’t lead to “wholesale change” for institutions.  
 Flaherty, who announced the mandated review in a press
release today, said “some fine-tuning to the system may be
required.” The bank legislation, which by law is reviewed every
five years, is set to expire April 20, 2012.
