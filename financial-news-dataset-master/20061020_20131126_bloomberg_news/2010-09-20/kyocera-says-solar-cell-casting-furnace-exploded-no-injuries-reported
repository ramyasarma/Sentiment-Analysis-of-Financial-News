             A  Kyocera Corp.  casting furnace
exploded at a plant in central Japan, spokeswoman  Chikako Morioka  said. There were no reports of injuries.  
 The explosion, in a furnace used to produce solar cells,
occurred at about 0:15 a.m. local time today, blowing off a door
and tearing a hole in a ceiling at the plant in Shiga Yasu,
Morioka said by telephone. The cause of the blast is under
investigation, and the impact of the incident has yet to be
determined, she said.  
 A fire was extinguished about one and half hours after the
explosion, the Yomiuri newspaper reported earlier today on its
website without saying where it got the information.
