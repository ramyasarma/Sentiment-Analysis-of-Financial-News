             Axa SA will extend its presence in
emerging markets, Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries was
reported as saying in an interview with French newspaper Les
Echos.  
 “We won’t target all markets and we are not limiting
ourselves to Asia,” the top executive at France’s largest
insurer was quoted as saying.  
 Separately, de Castries, alluding to the global financial
crisis, said Europe has a “formidable competitive advantage”
in its savings rate. The region misses an opportunity to do more
with those savings because they are invested at sub-optimal
levels, he said.
