             Investors should sell the euro
against the dollar as the 16-nation currency heads toward a one-
month low against the greenback, Citigroup Inc. said, citing
technical indicators.  
 The euro has held near the 76.4 percent Fibonacci
retracement level of $1.3158, which marks the drop from Aug. 6,
when the euro reached a three-month high, to Aug. 24, its lowest
level since July. The currency has also traded below its 200-day
moving average of $1.3228. Citigroup recommends establishing a
short position, or an order to sell, at $1.3095 with a target
level of $1.2588, the Aug. 24 low.  
 “We believe it is best to wait and see what happens around
these levels,” technical analysts led by  Tom Fitzpatrick  at
Citigroup in New York, wrote in a note to clients.  
 The euro rose 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.3079 as
of 8:02 a.m. in New York.  
 The currency could appreciate to $1.3334 if it breaks
through $1.3158 to $1.3228, Fitzpatrick said.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
new high or low. It is based on a formula developed by a 13th
century mathematician, Leonardo da Pisa, known as Fibonacci, who
discovered the sequence while studying the reproduction rate of
rabbits.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
