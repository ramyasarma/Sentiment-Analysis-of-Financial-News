             Mongolia will seek an initial
public offering for its Tavan Tolgoi mining assets after this
year’s opening of a national stock exchange, with the government
retaining control, Prime Minister  Sukhbaatar Batbold  said.  
 The country will sell as much as a 50 percent stake in the
coal deposit to the public, Batbold said in a briefing in New
York today. Mongolia will pick a contractor for the project in
the next month, he said.  
 China, the world’s biggest steelmaking nation, last year
increased  imports  of coking coal fivefold to a record as the
government closed unsafe mines.  Mongolian Mining Corp.  and
 Winsway Coking Coal Holdings Ltd. , both of which operate in
Mongolia, are seeking to raise as much as HK$9.74 billion ($1.3
billion) in Hong Kong initial public offerings to fund
expansion, according to term sheets sent to investors.  
 London Stock Exchange Group Plc is the “frontrunner” to
be the partner of Mongolia’s exchange and hold “management
rights,” Batbold said today. The country aims to open the
exchange this year, he said.  
 Batbold said he hopes publicly traded companies with
“strategic” assets in Mongolia, like  Rio Tinto Plc ., will seek
listings, and the country may seek to require them to do so.
