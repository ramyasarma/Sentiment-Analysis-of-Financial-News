             At least 25 people died and 78
others were injured after a cargo truck carrying about 100
passengers crashed on Sept. 18 in northern Ghana near the city
of Tamale, the Daily Graphic reported.  
 The passengers had been en route to a funeral when the
vehicle veered off the road while attempting to pass another
truck near the town of Zagyuri, about 700 kilometers (435 miles)
north of the capital, Accra, the newspaper said, citing Godwin
Cashman Blewushie, a deputy superintendent of police in the
region.  
 The driver, who survived the accident, is now in police
custody.
