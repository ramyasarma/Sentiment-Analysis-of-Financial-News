             Australian independent lawmaker
 Robert Oakeshott  said he would be reluctant to become speaker of
the nation’s parliament and asked opposition leader  Tony Abbott 
to nominate a Liberal Party member for the role.  
 “Abbott has agreed to come back within 24 hours on the
issue of a Liberal Party Member of Parliament in the Speakers
Chair, something I would strongly consider endorsing,” said
Oakeshott, who met with the Liberal leader today, in an e-mailed
statement. Calls and messages to Abbott’s office and to his
spokesman, Andrew Hirst, weren’t immediately answered.  
 Every vote will matter when parliament resumes on Sept. 28,
as Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s minority government relies on
the support of independent lawmakers Oakeshott,  Tony Windsor  and
 Andrew Wilkie , and  Greens Party  member  Adam Bandt , after her
Labor Party lost its majority at the Aug. 21 election.  
 Oakeshott had proposed “pairing rights” under which the
speaker would be linked with a lawmaker from a major party who
would abstain from votes on passing legislation. An agreement
signed by Gillard and Abbott on Sept. 6 pledged to grant that
arrangement, though it could be open to a legal challenge as
being unconstitutional.  
 “By coincidence or design, concerns have been raised --
constitutional, practical, political, or a combination of all
three -- regarding this agreement,” Oakeshott said today. “In
light of this confusion about the honoring of the agreement, I
would be very reluctant to accept any nomination for speaker.”
