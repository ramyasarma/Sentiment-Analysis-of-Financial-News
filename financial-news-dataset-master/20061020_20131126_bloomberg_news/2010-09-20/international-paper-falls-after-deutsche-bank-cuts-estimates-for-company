             International Paper Co. , the
world’s largest producer of corrugated packaging, slumped the
most in two months in New York after Deutsche Bank AG cut its
profit estimates for the company and its competitors.  
 International Paper  fell  $1.49, or 6.4 percent, to $21.97
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares, which dropped the most since June 29, have declined by
18 percent this year.  
 Pulp & Paper Week, an industry publication, on Sept. 17
reduced its previous assessment of August containerboard prices
to $640 a ton from $680 a ton,  Mark Wilde , a New York-based
analyst at Deutsche Bank, said today in a note to clients.  
 Wilde said in response he was “unwinding” his
expectations for a containerboard-price increase and cut his
profit estimates for International Paper,  Smurfit-Stone
Container Corp. , Temple-Inland Inc.,  Packaging Corp. of America ,
Greif Inc. and Rock-Tenn Co.  
 Containerboard is used to make corrugated shipping
containers.
