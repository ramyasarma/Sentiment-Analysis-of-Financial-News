             Kenya’s economy may grow faster in
2010 than the government’s target rate, fuelled by good rains
that boosted tea production and “strong” expansion in tourism
and manufacturing, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said.  
 “All indications are that we will be able to exceed the
targets that we set for ourselves,” Kenyatta told reporters in
Nairobi, the capital, today. Economic prospects in Kenya for
this year “are much brighter than what we had originally
forecast,” he said, declining to provide a revised figure.  
 In his June 10 budget speech, Kenyatta predicted growth of
4.5 percent this year, up from 2.6 percent in 2009. The economy
expanded an annual 4.4 percent in the first quarter, with
agriculture growing 4.6 percent after contracting the previous
six quarters due to a drought.  
 Farming accounts for about 25 percent of gross domestic
product in Kenya, the world’s largest grower of black tea. Tea
production in the country rose 61 percent to 183,946 metric tons
in the year to May.  
 Kenya is targeting a record 1.2 million foreign tourists
this year as it steps up promotional campaigns in emerging
markets such as Russia and China. Tourism is Kenya’s third-
biggest foreign exchange earner after horticulture and tea.
