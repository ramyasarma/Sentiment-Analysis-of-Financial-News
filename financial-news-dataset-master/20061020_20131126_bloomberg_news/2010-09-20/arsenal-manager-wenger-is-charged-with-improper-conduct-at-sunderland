             Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger was
charged with misconduct by English soccer’s ruling body today
over his behavior in the 1-1 Premier League draw at Sunderland
two days ago.  
 He’s accused of “using insulting and/or abusive 
language and behavior amounting to improper conduct” in his
contact with match officials, the Football Association said on
its website.  
 Arsenal conceded a goal to Darren Bent in the fifth minute
of injury time and lost the chance of going top of the league.
It’s now second, four points behind Chelsea, which beat
Blackpool 4-0 yesterday.       
 Wenger confronted fourth official Martin Atkinson at the
end of the match, and later complained to reporters that an
excessive amount of injury time was played. A minimum of four
minutes had been indicated, and a longer period wasn’t
justified, he said.  
 Under new “fast-track” procedures, Wenger has until Sept.
23 to respond to the charge. He’s been offered a standard
sanction of a one-match touchline ban and an 8,000-pound
($12,450) fine if he accepts the charge. If he denies it, the
case will go to a regulatory panel.
