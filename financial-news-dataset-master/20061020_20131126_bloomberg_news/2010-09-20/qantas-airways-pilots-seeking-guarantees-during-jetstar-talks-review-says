             Qantas Airways Ltd. pilots are
seeking guarantees from the company as it seeks to expand
internationally with budget unit Jetstar, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing their union.  
 The workers represented by the Australian and International
Pilots Association don’t want to give up higher pay and benefits
without “surety,” the newspaper said, citing Barry Jackson,
president of the group. Qantas pilots are paid at least 30
percent more than those at Jetstar, the Review said.
