             Philippine stocks  are set to extend
gains as corporate earnings rise more than expected and analysts
“re-rate” valuations, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  
 “The bull, it seems, is alive and kicking,” analysts
 Rafael Garchitorena  and  Carissa Mangubat  said in a report dated
Sept. 17. “Corporate returns on equity and dividend yields are
near all time-highs, while debt levels remain low.”  
 The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index  has risen 33 percent
this year, the best performer among the 15 biggest Asia Pacific
markets. The rally increased  valuations  of stocks in the
benchmark to 15.2 times estimated earnings from this year’s low
of 11.8 in February. The multiple may “overshoot” to 18, as it
did in 2007, the analysts said. The index rose 1.9 percent to a
record 4,053.32 at the 1 p.m. local time close, an all-time high.  
 Philippine economic growth accelerated to 7.9 percent in
the second quarter, the fastest pace in three years, on rising
exports and funds sent home by Filipinos working overseas.  
 Economic expansion and earnings growth of 23 percent this
year will push the equities into a “massive bull market,”  Alex Pomento , a strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd., said on Sept. 6,
predicting the  gauge  will reach 4,500 in 2011.  
 The measure will rise to 4,550 by December 2011, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. analysts led by  Gilbert Lopez  said in a report Sept.
9. The brokerage’s forecast for profits to grow 18 percent on
average in 2010 and 2011 may be “re-rated upwards,” they said.  
 Valuations are “in line with historical averages,” the
Deutsche Bank analysts said. “While the market has crossed from
the ‘hope’ phase into ‘recognition’ stage, valuations hardly
seem to imply exuberance or euphoria.”  
 Deutsche Bank was ranked third in Philippine research by
Institutional Investor magazine’s 2010 poll, behind CLSA Asia-
Pacific Markets and UBS AG.
