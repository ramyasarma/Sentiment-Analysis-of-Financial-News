             New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
said he intends to reduce income taxes within two years to
stimulate the economy.  
 A lower tax rate would help the state compete with
neighbors including Pennsylvania, which has a top margin of 3
percent compared with New Jersey’s 9 percent, Christie said in a
radio interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  
 “We’ve got to do that,” said Christie, 48, a Republican
who took office in January. “You can’t be competitive when your
top marginal rate is three times your neighbor.”  
 Christie became a star among the national Republican
establishment after he closed an $11 billion budget gap and won
legislative approval for a 2 percent limit on property-tax
increases and a reduction in public-employee benefits. He is
featured in a new 20-minute Republican Governors’ Association
film and will soon begin campaigning for fellow Republicans in
several other states, including California, Illinois and Ohio.  
 New Jersey still isn’t seeing any measurable improvement in
tax collections and needs to assume the “worst-case scenario,”
Christie said. The state’s average residential property-tax bill
was $7,281 in 2009, the highest in the U.S., according to the
state Department of Community Affairs.  
 Program Cuts  
 Christie’s budget for the year that began July 1 forecast
revenue will climb to $28.2 billion from $27.8 billion in fiscal
2010, still well below 2008’s  peak  of $32.6 billion. Collections
for the two months ended Aug. 31 were $3.4 billion, 2.5 percent
below predictions, the state treasury  department  said.  
 The governor said he will continue to reduce spending, and
is trying to “spread it out as evenly as we possibly can.” The
Senate plans to vote today to attempt to override Christie’s
veto of $7.5 million of funding for women’s health centers.  
 “There are going to be some worthwhile programs that are
cut,” Christie said.  
 Christie in May vetoed a proposal from Democrats who
control the Legislature to extend an income-tax surcharge on
residents earning at least $1 million a year.  
 The governor lowered spending by $10 billion in his first
budget. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services has
projected a deficit that may be as high as $10.5 billion next
year, assuming the state funds all programs and obligations.
Christie has said that is not an accurate estimate.  
 The governor said raising the retirement age, eliminating
cost-of-living adjustments and increasing employee contributions
are key to reducing the cost of pensions and benefits. He said
he anticipates a “real fight” with the unions representing
state workers.
