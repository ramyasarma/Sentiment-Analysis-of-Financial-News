             South Africa’s ruling African
National Congress and its allies disagree over monetary policy,
exchange controls and inflation targeting, Gwede Mantashe, the
organization’s secretary general, said in a report distributed
at a conference in Durban today.  
 The party needs concrete ideas on mine nationalization as
the country already gets royalties and owns mine rights, he
said.
