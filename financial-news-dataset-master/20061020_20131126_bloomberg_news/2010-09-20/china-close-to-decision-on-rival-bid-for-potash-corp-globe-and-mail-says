             China is close to a decision on a
rival bid to BHP Billiton Ltd.’s for control of Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., the Globe and Mail reported, citing people
familiar with the situation.  
 The government, which may present a bid by the end of the
month before national holidays start Oct. 1, is considering
several proposals from state-owned companies, including what
price to pay to beat BHP’s $38.6 billion bid, the newspaper
said.  
 Sinochem, the state-owned chemical group, has proposed
paying as much as $60 billion, while China Blue Chemical Ltd., a
division of China National Offshore Oil Corp., is another
contender, the Globe reported.
