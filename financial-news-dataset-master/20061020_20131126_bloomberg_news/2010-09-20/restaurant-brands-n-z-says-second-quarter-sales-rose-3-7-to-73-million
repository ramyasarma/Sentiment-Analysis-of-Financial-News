             Restaurant Brands New Zealand Ltd. 
which operates the nation’s KFC, Pizza Hut and Starbucks
franchises, reported second-quarter sales rose 3.7 percent amid
record turnover at its fried chicken outlets.  
 Sales for the 16 weeks ended Sept. 13 were NZ$100.4 million
($73.3 million), with KFC revenue rising 6.7 percent to NZ$72.8
million, the Auckland-based company said in a regulatory filing.
Total same store sales gained 3.9 percent in the quarter.  
 Year-to-date sales increased 3.9 percent to NZ$176.3
million with gains at KFC being offset by a 4.6 percent decline
at Pizza Hut.  
 Restaurant Brands said sales in the Canterbury area on New
Zealand’s South Island had recovered after initial disruptions
and some store closures following the Sept. 4 Christchurch
earthquake.
