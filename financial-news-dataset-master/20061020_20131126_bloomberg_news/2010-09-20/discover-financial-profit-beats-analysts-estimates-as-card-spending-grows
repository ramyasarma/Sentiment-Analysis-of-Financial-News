             Discover Financial Services , the
payments processor whose stock has outperformed its three larger
U.S. rivals this year, advanced 3.8 percent after posting third-
quarter profit that exceeded most  estimates .  
 Net income for the three months ended Aug. 31 was $260.6
million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $577.5 million in
the same period a year earlier, which included a $287 million
gain from a legal settlement, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based
lender said today in a statement. The average estimate of 16
 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg was 38 cents.  
 “Discover card spending continued to grow nicely this
quarter and our third-party credit and debit network businesses
achieved record transaction volumes,” Chief Executive Officer
 David Nelms  said in the statement.  
 Nelms, 49, is positioning his company to compete worldwide
with  Visa Inc. ,  MasterCard Inc.  and New York-based  American
Express Co.  He’s integrating Discover’s namesake network with
its Pulse and Diners Club brands so customers’ cards can be
accepted on all three.  
 The company’s Payment Services division processed a record
$39 billion in transactions as Discover card sales volume rose 5
percent on an annualized basis to $24 billion. Discover released
$187 million from an account to cover future loan losses as
write-offs for loans deemed uncollectible fell $101.5 million to
$899.5 million from $1 billion in the second quarter.  
 Credit Improvement  
 “The ongoing improvement in the outlook for credit
performance of our card members has enabled us to accelerate
investments for long-term profitable growth,” Nelms said.  
 The company last week agreed to buy  Citigroup Inc. ’s
Student Loan Corp. in a $600 million deal that would make
Discover the third-biggest U.S. provider of private student
loans.  
 Nelms said Discover now has agreements with the top 100
companies that set up U.S. merchants to accept electronic
payments. Those firms, or “merchant acquirers,” represent more
than 97 percent of the nation’s credit-card purchase volume.  
 “It wasn’t that many years ago that we had none of the top
100 and we were signing every merchant in the country
ourselves,” Nelms said in a telephone interview. “Now we have
the whole industry able to offer Discover as part of their
package.”  
 Discover  rose  3.8 percent to $16.16 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed
9.9 percent this year. San Francisco-based Visa, the world’s
biggest processor, dropped 20 percent and No. 2 MasterCard,
based in Purchase, New York, declined 15 percent. Amex, the
third-largest network and the biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by
purchases, gained 6.4 percent.
