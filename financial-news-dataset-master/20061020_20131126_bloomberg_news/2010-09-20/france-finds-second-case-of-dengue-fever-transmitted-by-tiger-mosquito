             France found a second case of
dengue fever transmitted locally by an Asian tiger mosquito,
suggesting the disease may take hold as the insect settles on
the European continent.  
 The patient, a resident of Nice on the French Riviera, has
recovered, according to the region’s health department. The
first case of local infection was found Sept. 13, also in Nice,
and “is an important public health event” because it’s the
first time that natural transmission of the dengue virus has
been reported in continental Europe since 1927-1928, the
European Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a
statement on its website.  
 Dengue is usually transmitted by the bite of infected
mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment. Symptoms include
fever, headaches and joint pain. A small number of cases can
cause hemorrhage and result in death, according to the ECDC.
 Sanofi-Aventis SA  is working on an experimental vaccine.  
 About 2.5 billion people worldwide live in areas prone to
the mosquito-borne virus, which the  World Health Organization 
says causes about 50 million infections each year.
