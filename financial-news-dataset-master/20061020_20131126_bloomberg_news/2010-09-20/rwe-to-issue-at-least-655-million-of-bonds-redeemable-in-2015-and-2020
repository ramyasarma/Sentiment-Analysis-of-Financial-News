             RWE AG , Germany’s second-biggest
utility, sold 1.75 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of hybrid bonds
in the biggest offering of the equity-like securities in Europe
since 2006.  
 RWE’s perpetual notes were priced to yield 265 basis points
more than the five-year benchmark swap rate, according to a
banker involved in the sale. The Essen-based company can redeem
the fixed-rate notes in 2015 and 2020. If the notes aren’t
called within 10 years, the coupon changes to a floating rate
equal to the initial spread plus 100 basis points more than the
euro interbank offered rate.  
 RWE’s issue follows sales in euros this month by  Scottish
and Southern Energy Plc , water company Suez Environnement SA,
and Australia’s Santos Ltd., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Companies sell hybrid bonds to raise money without
diluting shareholders, offering investors higher yields because
coupon payments can be deferred without defaulting.  
 “Institutional and retail interest in the bond will be
high,”  Mark Harmer , an analyst at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam,
wrote in a note to clients.  
 RWE officials in Essen didn’t respond to phone calls
seeking comment.  
 Siemens, Europe’s largest engineering company, raised $2.4
billion from the sale of 750 million pounds ($1.2 billion) and
900 million euros of hybrid bonds in September 2006, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Bonds ‘Underpinned’  
 The yield premium on RWE’s hybrid bonds compares with a
spread of 133 basis points over swaps that investors demand to
hold European investment-grade corporate bonds, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 “RWE’s new hybrid will be underpinned by hugely supportive
German investor base, and utility companies get high allocations
in most funds,” said  Charles Stephens , a debt capital markets
specialist at Matrix Corporate Capital LLP in London.  
 RWE is rated A by Standard & Poor’s, the sixth-highest
investment grade, and an equivalent A2 at Moody’s Investors
Service.  
 RWE shares closed up 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, at 51.10
euros. The stock dropped 25 percent this year.  
 BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc were
managing RWE’s bond issue, according to Bloomberg data.
