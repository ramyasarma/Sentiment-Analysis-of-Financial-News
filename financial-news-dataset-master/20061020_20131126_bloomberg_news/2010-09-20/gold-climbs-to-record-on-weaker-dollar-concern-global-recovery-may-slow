             Gold for immediate delivery rallied
to a record as the dollar weakened and after U.S. economic data
boosted concern the recovery may be faltering.  
 Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent
to an all-time high of $1,283.38 an ounce before trading at
$1,282.70 an ounce at 4:55 p.m. Melbourne time. Futures also
