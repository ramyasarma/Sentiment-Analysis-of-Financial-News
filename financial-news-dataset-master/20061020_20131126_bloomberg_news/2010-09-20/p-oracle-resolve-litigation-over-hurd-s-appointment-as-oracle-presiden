             Hewlett- Packard Co.  and  Oracle
Corp.  said they resolved litigation over the appointment of  Mark Hurd  as a president of Oracle and reaffirmed the long-term
partnership between the two companies.  
 “HP and Oracle have been important partners for more than
20 years and are committed to working together to provide
exceptional products and service to our customers,”  Cathie Lesjak , HP’s interim chief executive officer, said today in a
statement.  
 Hurd was sued Sept. 7 by HP, which tried to block his move.
The company said working as a president at Oracle would make it
“impossible” for him to avoid using or disclosing HP’s trade
secrets and confidential information. Hurd will adhere to his
obligations to protect HP’s confidential information while
fulfilling his responsibilities at Oracle, the companies said in
the statement today.  
 As part of the resolution of the legal dispute, Hurd and HP
agreed to modify terms of his separation agreement from HP,
including waiving his rights to 330,177 performance-based
restricted stock units granted in January 2008, HP said in a
regulatory filing. Hurd also waived his rights to 15,853
restricted stock units granted in December 2009, HP said.  
 Legal experts have said that HP would be unlikely to
prohibit Hurd’s move because California’s courts favor letting
employees move freely. The theory that trade secrets will
inevitably be disclosed “won’t work in California as a reason to
prevent someone from taking a job,”  Mark Lemley , a professor at
Stanford Law School who specializes in intellectual property,
said in an interview earlier this month.  
 HP gained 29 cents in extended  trading  to $39.68 after
rising 25 cents to $39.39 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange. Before today, the stock had dropped 15 percent since
Hurd resigned on Aug. 6.
