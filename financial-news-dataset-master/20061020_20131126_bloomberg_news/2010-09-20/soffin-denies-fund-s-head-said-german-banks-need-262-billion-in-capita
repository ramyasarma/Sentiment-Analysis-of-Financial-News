             Germany’s Soffin bank rescue fund
denied a report by  Euro am Sonntag  that cited the fund’s head,
 Hannes Rehm , as saying German lenders may need 200 billion euros
($262 billion) in fresh capital.  
 Rehm said banks in the Group-of-20 nations may need 200
billion euros in capital between 2013 to 2018 based on studies,
according to Madleen Petschmann, a Soffin spokeswoman. Rehm, who
had spoken at an event in Dresden, was misquoted by Euro am
Sonntag, Petschmann said.
