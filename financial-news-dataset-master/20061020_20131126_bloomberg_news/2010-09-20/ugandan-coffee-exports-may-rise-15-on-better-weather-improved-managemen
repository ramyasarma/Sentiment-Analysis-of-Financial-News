             Coffee shipments from  Uganda ,
Africa’s largest exporter of the beans, may rise 15 percent
during the 2010-11 season because of better weather and improved
crop husbandry methods, according to the  Uganda Coffee
Development Authority .  
 Exports in the 12 months through September 2011 may rise to
3.1 million 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags, from the 2.7 million
bags expected this season,  David Kiwanuka , spokesman for the
Kampala-based authority, said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 “The upward projection is based on the relatively good
weather compared to 2009,” he wrote. Uganda’s coffee is largely
dependent on rainfall for water because of a lack of irrigation
capacity by the nation’s small-scale farmers who produce more
than 95 percent of the country’s output.  
 Coffee production in the 2010-11 season may also be boosted
by the improved prices received by farmers during the second
half of this season, which has allowed them to invest in
improving crop husbandry methods, Kiwanuka said.  
 Exports in 2009-10 may decline to 2.7 million bags from
3.06 bags in 2008-09 after a drought cut yields. Shipments from
Oct. 1 through August fell 13 percent to 2.5 million bags, the
authority has said.  
 Ugandan production slumped from more than 4 million bags in
1996-97 after coffee wilt disease destroyed plants. New planting
and improving farm management may help the country boost output
to 4.5 million bags by 2015, the authority has said.  
 The East African nation is the continent’s second-largest
coffee producer, after Ethiopia. Robusta accounts for about 85
percent of Uganda’s annual output.
