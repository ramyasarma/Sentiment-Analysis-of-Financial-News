             Asian currencies rose, building on
three weekly advances, on speculation global funds will boost
their holdings of regional assets to profit from the world’s
fastest economic growth.  
 The  Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, climbed to
a two-year high. The Philippine peso gained 0.3 percent to
44.055 per dollar and India’s rupee was up 0.4 percent at 45.65
as of 2:53 p.m. in Mumbai. China’s yuan climbed 0.1 percent to
6.7121 and reached 6.7085, its strongest since official and
market exchange rates were unified at the end of 1993.  
 “Strong fundamentals in Asia attract foreign funds to the
local stock markets,” said  Eric Hsing , a debt trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Asian currencies will continue to
strengthen.”  
 Overseas investors have plowed more than $7.5 billion into
equities in India, South Korea and Taiwan this month and the
 MSCI Asia Pacific Index  of shares today reached its highest
level since April. Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.2
percent in 2010, outpacing growth of 2.6 percent in advanced
countries, the International Monetary Fund forecast in July.  
 The yuan strengthened on speculation China will yield to
increased political pressure from the U.S., which is seeking
faster appreciation in the currency. Trade balances in Thailand
and the  Philippines  swung to surpluses in August, according to
data released today.  
 ‘In Limbo’  
 South Korea’s won slipped 0.1 percent to 1,161.30 per
dollar amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen. Irish
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told the Sunday Telegraph the
country won’t need financial aid from the European Union,
seeking to quell speculation that Ireland will require outside
assistance.  
 Malaysia’s ringgit weakened after an unexpected decline in
U.S. consumer confidence stoked concern a slowdown in the
world’s biggest economy will damp demand for Asian exports. The
ringgit declined 0.1 percent to 3.1045.  
 “The U.S. economy is still in limbo, while the euro-zone
debt situation remains very much on investors’ radars,” said
 Suresh Kumar Ramanathan , a currency strategist at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “This could restrain the
ringgit’s appreciation in the short term.”  
 Elsewhere, the Indonesian rupiah and the Singapore dollar
were little changed at 8,978 and S$1.3340, respectively, versus
the greenback. The Taiwan dollar and Thailand’s baht were alos
steady at NT$31.752 and 30.74.
