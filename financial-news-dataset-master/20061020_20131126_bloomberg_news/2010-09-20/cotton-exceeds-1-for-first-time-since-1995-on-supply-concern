             Cotton futures topped $1 a pound in
New York for the first time since 1995 as supplies plunged and
demand increased from textile mills.  
 Inventories  monitored by ICE Futures U.S. plummeted 98
percent since June 2, to 16,569 bales, on Sept. 17. China, the
world’s biggest grower and buyer, may boost imports after rain
hurt crop quality and output, according to five China-based
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News this month. Heavy rains
soaked some open-boll cotton in its final development stage,
they said. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  
 “There is basically very little cotton right now,” said
 Tom Reardon , the president of Delta Brokerage in New York.
Supplies will remain tight until late October or early November,
when farmers in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter, will
have most of their crops harvested, Reardon said.  
 Cotton for December delivery jumped 1.15 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at 99.37 cents a pound at 2:38 p.m. on ICE in
New York. Earlier, the fiber advanced to $1.0198, the highest
price for a most-active contract since June 19, 1995. Cotton has
surged 31 percent this year.  
 “Mills are sweating blood over both prices and shortage of
supplies,”  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville,
Louisiana, said in a note that was e-mailed yesterday. Prices
are being “fueled by solid fundamental news,” he said.  
 Cotton’s gain this year is the third biggest of the 19
commodities tracked by the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index, behind
wheat and coffee. The index, up 5.8 percent this month, rose as
much as 0.6 percent today before paring gains.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long  positions  in New York cotton futures by 2 percent
in the week ended Sept. 14, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data. Speculative long positions, or bets
prices will advance, outnumbered short positions by 55,939
contracts.
