             Corn futures fell from a 23-month
high on bets that this quarter’s rally will erode demand for
feed by U.S. livestock and poultry producers.  
 Before today, corn surged 37 percent in the third quarter
on concern that adverse weather slashed U.S. yields. U.S.
supplies  inspected  for export fell 34 percent to 28.5 million
bushels in the week ended Sept. 16 from a week earlier, the U.S.
Department of agriculture said today. Cattle futures fell from a
two-year high.  
 “As a banker, we would rather have livestock producers
floating than locking in feed costs and guaranteeing a
production loss,” said  Michael Swanson , a senior agricultural
economist at Minneapolis-based Wells Fargo & Co., the largest
U.S. farm lender. Livestock, dairy and broiler producers “are
all running on razor’s edge after the rally in prices,” he
said.  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 5 cents, or 1
percent, to close at $5.0825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $5.2375, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Sept. 30, 2008.  
 Prices also fell on speculation that yields will improve as
the harvest progresses, said  Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain
analyst for Prudential Bache Commodities LLC in Chicago.  
 The crop will total 13.16 billion bushels, down from 13.365
billion forecast in August, the government said on Sept. 10. An
estimated 11 percent was harvested as of Sept. 12, up from the
average of 6 percent at the same time in the previous five
seasons, the USDA said last week.  
 “We can see some better yields as the harvest moves north
because it was cooler and many fields received regular rains in
August,” McCambridge said.  
 The drop in futures today snapped a seven-session rally,
the longest advance since June 2008.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
