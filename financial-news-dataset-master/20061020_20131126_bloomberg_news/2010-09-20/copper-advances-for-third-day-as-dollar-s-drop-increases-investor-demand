             Copper climbed for a third day,
rising to a five-month high, as the weakening dollar boosted
demand for raw materials as alternative investments. Zinc, lead
and nickel also advanced.  
 The three-month contract on the London Metal Exchange
gained as much as 1.2 percent to $7,812 a metric ton, the
highest price since April 26, and was at $7,788 at 3:15 p.m. in
Singapore. Copper for December in Shanghai rose as much as 1.2
percent to a two-week high of 60,440 yuan ($9,006).  
 “The Fed is expected to keep interest rates low during
their meeting this week, which should put pressure on the dollar
and support metals prices,”  Zeng Chao , an analyst at Everbright
Futures Co., said in an e-mail. “Trading this week will be
marked by low volumes, with China out from Wednesday.”  
 Financial markets in China, the world’s largest metals user,
are closed from Sept. 22 to Sept. 24 for the Mid-Autumn festival
holiday. Factories and construction sites, which use copper for
making pipes and wires, may close or run at a reduced rate.  
 The  dollar  fell against a six-currency basket, including
the euro, on speculation that the Federal Reserve’s Open Market
Committee will say at a meeting tomorrow it’s considering
further measures to keep borrowing costs low. The dollar was at
$1.3092 per euro from $1.3050 on Sept. 17, when it slid to
$1.3159, the weakest level since Aug. 11.  
 “Metals are also benefiting from the rally in the
agricultural market” as investors put more funds into commodity
holdings as prices rise, said Wang Hongchuan, deputy general
manager at Chongqing Xianrong Futures Brokerage Co.  
 Corn, which on Sept. 17 traded at more than $5 a bushel for
the first time since 2008, extended its rally today. Futures in
Dalian surged to a record. Cotton in New York jumped to the
highest price in more than 15 years, trading at more than $1 a
pound. Wheat and soybeans also gained today.  
 Indonesia Tin  
 Tin, which reached $23,800 a ton on Sept. 17, the
highest level since July 2008, dropped 0.2 percent to $23,550 a
ton at 3:18 p.m. Singapore time.  
 Tin shipments from Indonesia, the largest exporter, may
drop 19 percent this year to about 80,000 tons from 99,287 tons
in 2009 as heavy rains disrupt mining, according to the trade
ministry, adding to signs of a slump in trade that’s helped make
the commodity this year’s best base-metal performer. That’s in
line with an August forecast from Indonesia’s energy ministry
for a 20 percent decline in output.  
 Aluminum in London increased 0.6 percent to $2,192 a ton,
zinc climbed 1.9 percent to $2,192 a ton, lead advanced 0.9
percent to $2,221.25 a ton and nickel increased 1 percent to
$23,431 a ton.
