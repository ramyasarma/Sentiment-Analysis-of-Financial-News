             England bowler Ryan Sidebottom, who
has just helped Nottinghamshire win the county championship,
said he’s retiring from international cricket.  
 “I have had a truly fantastic period of my life with
England but now it is time to hand over the ball to those a
little younger,” the 32-year-old said in a statement from the
England and Wales Cricket Board.   
 Highlights of his career included winning the Twenty20
World Cup in the West Indies this year, his Test debut against
Pakistan at Lord’s and a Test hat-trick against New Zealand, he
said.  
 “I have been fortunate enough to live the dream with 
England,” said Sidebottom, who has also said he’ll leave
Nottinghamshire for another county. “It has been a fantastic
time but I have no doubts that now is the right time to announce
my retirement.”  
 The Yorkshire-born cricketer played 22 Tests, 25 one-day
internationals and 18 Twenty20s for England in a nine-year
international career.
