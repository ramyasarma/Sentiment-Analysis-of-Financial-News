             Iran wants to resume talks about a
uranium-fuel swap for a Tehran nuclear reactor, said Ali Akbar
Salehi, head of the country’s Atomic Organization, today in a
speech to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.  
 Talks with France, Russia and the U.S. should resume
“without further delay,” Salehi said at the IAEA’s General
Conference. Iran will also propose the creation of a regional
trade group to exchange nuclear technology, he said.
