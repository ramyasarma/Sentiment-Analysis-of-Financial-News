             German tax receipts rose in August
even as the economy has a “subdued” start into the third
quarter, the Berlin-based  Finance Ministry  said.  
 Tax revenue last month rose 3.6 percent from a year
earlier, bringing the eight-month total to 306.3 billion euros
($402 billion), the ministry said today in its monthly report.
That’s 0.4 percent less than in the same period in 2009, said
the ministry. It forecast full-year returns will decline 2.6
percent.  
 “The upswing should continue in the course of this year,
albeit at a clearly slower pace,” the ministry said. “Current
industrial indicators show that the German economy went into the
third quarter on a subdued note.”  
 German  investor  confidence fell to an 19-month low in
September, exports and  factory orders  declined in July while the
number of people out of work fell less than economists forecast
in August.  
 Still, “unusually strong growth” of 2.2 percent in the
second quarter compared with the previous three months is
helping Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government tap capital
markets less than planned this year, the ministry said. New
borrowing, which amounted to 49.2 billion euros at the end of
August, will be “clearly below” 60 billion euros at the end of
the year, it said.  
 Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said on Sept. 17
federal borrowing may be as low as 50 billion euros in 2010,
down from an initial forecast of 86 billion euros at the
beginning of the year.
