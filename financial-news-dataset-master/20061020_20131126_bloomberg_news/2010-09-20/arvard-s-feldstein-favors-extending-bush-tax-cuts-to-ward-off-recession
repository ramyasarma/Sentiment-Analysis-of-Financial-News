             Harvard University economics
professor  Martin Feldstein  said raising taxes on the wealthiest
Americans could push the nation back into a recession and urged
that all Bush-era tax cuts be extended for two years.  
 Feldstein, a member of the committee that dates the
beginning and end of recessions, said President  Barack Obama ’s
proposal to allow tax cuts for the wealthy to lapse “is going
to slow the economy down and could push the economy into
recession again next year.”  
 “We should extend all of the Bush tax cuts for two years
and we will have a clean slate and see where the economy is,”
Feldstein said today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “We should commit now to two
years -- and nothing beyond the two years.”  
 Obama wants to extend the tax cuts passed under President
 George W. Bush  for American households earning less than
$250,000 and individuals earning up to $200,000. The cuts would
be allowed to lapse on Dec. 31 for those earning more.  
 Feldstein, speaking a day before Federal Reserve policy
makers meet, said there’s little more the central bank can do to
sustain a recovery from the deepest recession since the 1930s.
“The Fed has done a very good job and I don’t think can do
more,” he said.
