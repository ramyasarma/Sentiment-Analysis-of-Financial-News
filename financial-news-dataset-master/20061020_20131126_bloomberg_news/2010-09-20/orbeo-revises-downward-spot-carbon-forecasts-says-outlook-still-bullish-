             Orbeo revised down its forecast for
spot carbon permits in the European Union’s emissions trading
program to 16.5 euros a metric ton in the fourth quarter from
the previous estimate of 19 euros.  
 The Paris-based carbon-trading venture of Societe Generale 
and Rhodia SA said its outlook for prices was “still bullish,”
according to a research note dated Sept. 17.  
 Orbeo also lowered its forecast for spot carbon permits in
the EU to 19.5 euros in 2011 from 21 euros.
