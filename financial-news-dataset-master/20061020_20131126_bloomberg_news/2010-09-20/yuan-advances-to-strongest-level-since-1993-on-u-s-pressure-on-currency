             The yuan strengthened to a 17 year-
high on speculation the Chinese government will yield to
increased political pressure from the U.S., which is seeking a
faster appreciation of the currency.  
 The central bank set the reference rate at a record high
for a seventh straight day after Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner said last week the U.S. will use every available tool
to urge China to let the yuan rise more quickly. Calls to let
the currency strengthen will grow as China faces swelling trade
protectionism against its exports, Li Daokui, an adviser to the
People’s Bank of China, said yesterday.  
 “China will face big pressure on its currency policy”
before mid-term elections in the U.S. in November, said  Shen Jianguang , a Hong Kong-based economist with Mizuho Securities
Asia Ltd. “All domestic economic factors point to faster
appreciation of the yuan.”  
 The yuan climbed 0.14 percent to 6.7143 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency earlier touched 6.7085, the strongest level since
the central bank unified official and market exchange rates at
the end of 1993.  
 The monetary authority set the reference rate at 6.7110,
the strongest since a dollar peg was scrapped in July 2005.  
 China’s  industrial output  grew 13.9 percent in August from
a year earlier, according to statistics bureau data released on
Sept. 11. That compared with an increase of 13.4 percent in July
and the 13 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 U.S. President Barack Obama will hold talks on Sept. 23
with Premier Wen Jiabao during this week’s United Nations
General Assembly in New York, the White House said on Sept. 17.
