             Kenya aims to build its first
nuclear power plant by 2017 as it looks for less-expensive
alternatives to thermals fuels such as oil and gas, Energy
Ministry Permanent Secretary  Patrick Nyoike  said.  
 “We need cheap sources of electricity; the thermals are
expensive,” Nyoike told reporters today in the East African
nation’s capital, Nairobi.  
 Kenya last week appointed former Energy Minister Ochillo
Ayacko to head the Nuclear Electricity Project, a plan to make
Kenya an atomic-power producer, Nyoike said. Ayacko’s first task
will be to convince skeptics that the country is pursuing
nuclear power safely and he will also be expected to help Kenya
conform to the United Nations’  International Atomic Energy
Agency  standards, said Nyoike. The budget for developing nuclear
energy in the fiscal year through June 2011 is 200 million
shillings ($2.5 million), he said.  
 One proposal that is being studied is to build a 1,000-
megawatt nuclear power plant, probably along the coast in a
joint venture with the government and private companies. A
facility of those specifications using South Korean technology
would cost as much as $3.5 billion to build, said Nyoike.  
 Kenya Electricity Generation Co. Ltd. , the country’s
largest power producer, aims to almost triple installed capacity
to 3,000 megawatts by 2018 and increase that to 9,000 megawatts
by 2030, Managing Director  Eddy Njoroge  said Aug. 18
