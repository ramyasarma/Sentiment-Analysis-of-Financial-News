             Teck Resources Ltd. , Canada’s
largest diversified mining company, cut its coal-sales forecast
because of capacity constraints at a British Columbian port.  
 Third-quarter sales will be 5.2 million to 5.5 million
metric tons, compared with a previous target of 5.8 million to
6.2 million tons, the Vancouver-based company said today in a
statement. Teck also reduced its 2010 sales forecast to 23
million to 23.8 million tons, from 23.5 million to 24.5 million
tons.  
 Teck declined 22 cents to C$39.10 at 4:15 p.m. in Toronto
Stock Exchange trading. The shares have risen 6.2 percent this
year.  
 Coal sales were hindered by temporary constraints at
Westshore Terminals, which has been operating at less than its
annual capacity of 29 million tons during the third quarter,
Teck said. Westshore will make improvements to meet expected
deliveries in 2011, Teck said.  
 Westshore operates a coal terminal 32 kilometers (20 miles)
south of Vancouver, according to its  website . Nick Desmarais,
Westshore’s corporate secretary, didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment.  
 Teck said it’s taking measures to limit the disruption,
including diverting shipments to Neptune Bulk Terminals (Canada)
Ltd. and Ridley Terminals Inc.  
 Westshore rose 4 cents to C$19.67 in Toronto trading. The
shares have gained 38 percent this year.
