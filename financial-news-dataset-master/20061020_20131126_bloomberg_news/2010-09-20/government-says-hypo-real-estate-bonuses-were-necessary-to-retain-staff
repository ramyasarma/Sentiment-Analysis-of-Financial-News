             The German government defended a 25
million-euro bonus to employees of state-owned bank Hypo Real
Estate Holding AG as “not inappropriate,” saying the one-time
payment was necessary to hold on to experienced managers.   
 Hypo Real Estate’s transfer of almost 200 billion euros
worth of toxic assets into a so-called bad bank is one of “the
most complex transactions in German financial history,” Finance
Ministry spokesman Michael Offer told reporters in Berlin. “For
this operation, the bank needs experienced and good employees.”
