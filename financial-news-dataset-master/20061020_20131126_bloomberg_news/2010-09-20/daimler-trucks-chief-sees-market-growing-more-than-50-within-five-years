             Daimler AG , Europe’s biggest
truckmaker, said the world market for heavy vehicles will expand
by more than half by 2015, driven by demand from emerging
economies such as China, India and Russia.  
 Worldwide truck sales may swell to about 3 million vehicles
by 2015,  Andreas Renschler , head of Daimler Trucks, said in
written remarks prepared for delivery today at the Hanover
Trucks Show.  
 “The trucks business is recovering alongside the global
economy,” Renschler said, citing a “considerable uptrend” in
Asia and a “moderate” improvement in the U.S. “That’s why we
can rely on stable tailwind from markets.”  
 The global recession prompted freight companies to put off
ordering vehicles. Daimler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, makes
Mercedes-Benz heavy vehicles in Europe, Freightliner models in
the U.S. and Fuso trucks in Asia.  
 Daimler will increase its presence in the so-called BRIC
nations of Brazil, Russia, China and India as well as in smaller
emerging countries known as the “Next 11,” Renschler said.
Daimler will add two more brands and five factories in emerging
markets, the executive said, without providing specifics.
