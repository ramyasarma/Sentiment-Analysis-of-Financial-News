Irish, Greek and Spanish bonds rose
after the nations’ governments sold 8.9 billion euros ($11.7
billion) of securities, easing concern they will struggle to
finance their debt burdens.  Ireland auctioned 1.5 billion euros of 2014 and 2018 debt,
the maximum amount sought, the  National Treasury Management
Agency  in Dublin said today. Spain sold 7 billion euros of 12-
and 18-month bills, with Greece selling 390 million euros of 13-
week securities, their debt agencies said. Yields on the 10-year
bonds of Ireland, Greece and Spain fell relative to benchmark
German bunds and the euro extended gains following the sales.  “It was very good across the board,” said  Harvinder Sian ,
a senior fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc in London. “The biggest focus of the day was clearly on the
Irish supply and the auction results looks very impressive. But
the situation is still quite fragile.”  Investor concern about the fiscal health of some euro-
region nations is resurfacing four months after the European
Union and International Monetary Fund crafted an almost $1
trillion rescue package to stamp out contagion from Greece’s
debt crisis. The extra  yield , or spread, between Irish 10-year
bonds and bunds reached a euro-era high of 404 basis points
yesterday. The Portuguese-German gap also rose to a record.  Ireland sold 500 million euros of debt due in 2014 at an
average yield of 4.767 percent, compared with 3.627 percent at
the previous auction on Aug. 17, the debt office said. It also
auctioned 1 billion euros of 2018 securities at a yield of 6.023
percent, up from 5.088 percent at a June sale.  ‘Good News’  “The Irish bond auction went quite well and that’s good
news because it showed despite bad headlines and risk aversion,
Ireland can still fund itself,” said  Christoph Kind , head of
asset allocation at Frankfurt Trust, which oversees about $20
billion. “I was not a buyer, but obviously there are investors
out there who are willing to take some risk for higher yields.”  Spain sold 5.28 billion euros of 12-month bills at an
average yield of 1.908 percent, compared with 1.836 percent at a
sale on Aug. 17, the Treasury said today in Madrid. It auctioned
1.76 billion euros of 18-month debt to yield 2.146 percent,
compared with 2.078 percent previously.  Greece sold 390 million euros of 13-week Treasury bills at
a yield of 3.98 percent, the Athens-based Public Debt Management
Agency said today.  The spread between Irish 10-year bonds and bunds narrowed
24 basis points to 378 basis points, or 3.78 percentage points.
The  Spanish-German  difference in yield fell 6 basis points to
170 basis points, while the extra yield investors demand to hold
Greek 10-year securities instead of bunds declining 20 basis
points to 889 basis points.  The euro advanced 0.5 percent to $1.3130, after climbing as
much as 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
