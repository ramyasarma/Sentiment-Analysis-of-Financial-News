             Petra Diamonds Ltd.  posted net
income of $63.5 million, or 22.2 cents a share, in the year
through June, compared with a net loss of $90.9 million, or
49.38 cents, a year earlier.  
 “The outlook for the diamond market is positive, with a
significant supply gap anticipated in the coming years as demand
continues apace in emerging markets,” the Hamilton, Bermuda-
based company said today in a regulatory statement. Petra
reported “substantially improved” prices for the first two
tenders of the current fiscal year.
