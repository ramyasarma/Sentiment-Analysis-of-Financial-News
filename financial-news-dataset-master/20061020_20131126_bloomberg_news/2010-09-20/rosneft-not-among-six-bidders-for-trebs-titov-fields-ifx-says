             OAO Rosneft is not among the six
oil producers that applied to bid in the tender for the Trebs
and Titov oil fields, Interfax said, citing an unidentified
official at the Russian subsoil resources agency.  
 The Russian unit of India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp., known
as ONGC, and OAO Lukoil paid entry fees, the news service said.
OAO Bashneft, OAO Surgutneftegaz, OAO Gazprom Neft and TNK-BP’s
Samotlorneftegaz unit said earlier they had applied to
participate in the tender.
