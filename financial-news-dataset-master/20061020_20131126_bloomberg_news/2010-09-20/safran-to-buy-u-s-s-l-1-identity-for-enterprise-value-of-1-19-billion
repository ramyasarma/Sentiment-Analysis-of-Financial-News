             Safran SA , a French maker of
aerospace engines and equipment, agreed to buy most of  L-1
Identity Solutions Inc . for $1.6 billion including debt to
expand biometric fingerprint and facial recognition technology.  
 Safran will pay $12 a share, 24 percent more than L-1’s
share price on Sept. 17, Safran said today. The U.S. company
also agreed today to sell its counter-terrorism business to  BAE
Systems Plc  for $296 million in cash, and the L-1 purchase by
Safran is contingent on the BAE deal going through first.  
 Since 2007, Safran has made several acquisitions in the
security and defense area under Chief Executive Officer  Jean- Paul Herteman . Safran also remains interested in  Zodiac
Aerospace , a maker of airline seats, escape chutes and other
components, the CEO said today.  
 “There’s no link between L-1 and our feeling about
Zodiac,” the CEO said on a call with analysts today. “We
always said that merging Zodiac and Safran would be a good idea
and we are still looking at that.”  
 Zodiac, based near Paris, rebuffed an initial overture in
July, saying it preferred to remain independent. Safran wants
Zodiac to enlarge its product range to engines, braking systems
and landing gear, as well as letting Safran deepen ties with
planemakers including Airbus SAS and  Boeing Co .  
 Biometrics Market  
 Safran predicts the general biometrics market will grow 15
percent annually over the next five years, though Safran is
taking a “conservative” forecast of 10 percent growth for the
business it’s acquiring, according to  Olivier Andries , who heads
the defense and security division. The Paris-based manufacturer
got 19 percent of sales from defense security solutions last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Safran  gained  5.2 percent to 20.40 euros in Paris today,
giving the company a market value of 8.5 billion euros.  
 L-1’s estimated  net debt  at the transaction’s completion
will be approximately $100 million, including the cash proceeds
from the prior sale of the government consulting business,
Safran said in an e-mailed release today.  
 Safran’s defense and security unit has made three
 acquisitions  since mid 2007. Those include Sdu-Identification BV
in the Netherlands for 325 million euros. Sdu is one of Europe’s
biggest makers of secure identification cards and passes.  
 Safran bought the biometry businesses of Motorola Inc. for
$133 million in April 2009, and in September, it purchased 81
percent of  GE  Homeland Protection from General Electric Co. for
$407 million. The business was renamed Morpho Detection. GE has
kept 19 percent of the company. The businesses involve detection
of dangerous substances carried in baggage.
