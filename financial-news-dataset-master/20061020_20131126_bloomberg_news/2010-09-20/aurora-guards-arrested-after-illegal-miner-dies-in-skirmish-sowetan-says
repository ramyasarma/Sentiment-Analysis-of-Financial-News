             South African police arrested four
security guards working at a mine partly owned by Nelson
Mandela’s grandson and President Jacob Zuma’s nephew for the
murder of an illegal miner, attempted murder and assault,
Sowetan said, citing police spokesman Tommy Tomlinson.  
 Police also arrested 16 illegal miners at Aurora Mine in
Grootvlei, Springs, east of Johannesburg, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. The 20 men will all appear in the magistrate’s
court in Springs today, following a confrontation between the
guards and miners on Sept. 17, Sowetan said.  
 The incident at the mine, which counts Khulubuse Zuma and
Zondwa Mandela among its shareholders, follows a shootout
between guards and illegal miners last month that left four
people dead, Sowetan said.
