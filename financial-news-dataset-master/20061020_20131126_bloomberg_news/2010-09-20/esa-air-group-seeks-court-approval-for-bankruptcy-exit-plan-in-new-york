             Mesa Air Group Inc. , the regional
airline that filed for bankruptcy in January, will give a
10 percent stake in the company to  US Airways Group Inc.  as part
of its restructuring.  
 Mesa will issue stock to US Airways in exchange for a new
flying pact between the airlines known as a code-share
agreement, Mesa said in its proposed restructuring plan filed
Sept. 17 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  
 Mesa serves 94 cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The
Phoenix-based company operates regional flights for major
airlines under code-share agreements. Its consolidated revenue
in 2009 was about $968 million, according to a court filing by
the company.  
 The bankruptcy plan, which requires court approval, will
give unsecured creditors with claims of about $2 billion new
Mesa stock and $50 million of new notes, according to the court
filing. After the restructuring, Mesa’s enterprise value will be
$938.5 million to $1.097 billion, the company said.  
 Liz Landau, a US Airways spokeswoman, said the airline is
continuing to negotiate with Mesa about the code-share
agreement. She declined to comment specifically about the stock
allocation under Mesa’s bankruptcy plan.  
 “Nothing’s really final at this point,” she said.  
 A Mesa spokesman couldn’t be reached for comment.  
 The case is In re Mesa Air Group Inc., 10-10018, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
