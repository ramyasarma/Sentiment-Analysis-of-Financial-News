             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on adverse weather in Canada and
Russia, which are among the world’s biggest exporters, said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants
Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 20 cents to 25 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on concern that freezing weather in the past three
days damaged crops in Canada, Henderson said. Cold weather this
week may reduce production in China, he said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $4 to $5 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open up 0.65 cent to 0.75 cent a pound.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel
higher as rains delay U.S. harvesting after hot weather in
August reduced yields, Henderson said.
