             U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi held a
discussion today in New York on the yuan, a State Department
spokesman said.  
 The currency issue “is an important aspect of our
bilateral relationship,” department spokesman Philip J. Crowley
told reporters. “We both understand it is vitally important and
has to be properly managed on both sides.”  
 China’s leaders haven’t done “everything they said would
be done” to allow the nation’s currency to rise in value,
President Barack Obama said today, echoing the views expressed
by administration officials and lawmakers at congressional
hearings last week.  
 Clinton is in New York, along with other foreign ministers,
for the annual opening of the United Nations General Assembly.
