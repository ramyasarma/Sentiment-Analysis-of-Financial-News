             New York Jets defensive back
 Darrelle Revis  might be sidelined up to two weeks because
of a hamstring injury suffered yesterday in a win over the
New England Patriots.  
 “I know there’s a report that Darrelle will be out
one to two weeks,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said today at a
news conference, saying he didn’t have the results of an
exam done this morning. “Maybe he knows more than I do at
this time.”  
 Revis said following the exam that he wouldn’t rule
himself out for the team’s Sept. 26 game at the Miami
Dolphins, though it’s likely he’ll miss one or two weeks,
ESPN reported on its website.  
 “We’ve got to be smart and do what’s in the best
interest of the football team and Darrelle,” Ryan said.
“We’re not going to force the guy to play, but it’s a big
game and a lot of different variables go into the
decision.”  
 Revis exited the game yesterday after aggravating a
hamstring injury while getting beaten by  Randy Moss  for a
second-quarter touchdown.  
 Revis on Sept. 6 ended a seven-month impasse with the
Jets, signing a new contract after missing training camp.
The accord is worth $46 million over four years, according
to the New York Daily News.  
 The 25-year-old had six interceptions and a league-
leading 37 passes defended last season while anchoring a
Jets defense that allowed a league-low 252.3 yards per
game. The team reached the American Football Conference
Championship and he was named runner-up to the Green Bay
Packers’  Charles Woodson  in voting for the NFL’s Defensive
Player of the Year Award.
