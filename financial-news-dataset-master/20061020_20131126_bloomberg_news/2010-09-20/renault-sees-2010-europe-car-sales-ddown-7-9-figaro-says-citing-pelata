             Renault SA sees a drop of 7 percent
to 9 percent in car sales this year in Europe and a
“siginificant” decline in 2011, Le Figaro reported, citing
Patrick Pelata, the company’s deputy chief executive officer.  
 The company sees strong growth in markets outside of
Europe, including Turkey, Brazil and Russia, the newspaper cited
Pelata as saying. Renault expects to sell 2.5 million cars this
year, up from 2.3 million in 2009, the daily said.  
 If the current trends continue, countries outside Europe
may represent 50 percent of total sales in 2013 from 40 percent
now and 11 percent in 1999, the executive was quoted as saying.
