             Aevum Ltd.  has recommended short-to
medium-term shareholders accept a sweetened A$320 million ($303
million) takeover bid from  Stockland  after a valuation firm
found the offer was “not fair but that it is reasonable.”  
 Lonergan Edwards & Associates Ltd. , the independent expert
hired by Aevum to advise on the offer from its biggest
shareholder, said in a report accompanying Aevum’s response that
the A$1.80 a share bid is still “materially below” the mid-
point of its valuation range of A$1.91 to A$2.22 a share.  
 “Our assessed value of Aevum shares has been determined
having regard to their medium- to long-term prospects,” Craig
Edwards and Martin Holt, directors at Lonergan Edwards, wrote in
the report.  
 Lonergan Edwards recommends that longer-term shareholders
“may wish to retain their Aevum shares to seek to realize the
full underlying value of Aevum shares over time.”  
 Stockland’s revised offer allows Aevum shareholders with a
shorter investment-time horizon to sell their shares “at what
they may consider to be an acceptable level of discount to
underlying value and a significant premium to pre-bid market
prices.”  
 Stockland, Australia’s biggest diversified property group,
increased its bid for Aevum from A$1.50 a share after the
retirement village operator rejected the offer, saying it
undervalues the company. Stockland put its revised bid, under
which it will pay $1.77 a share plus a 3-cent final dividend,
directly to shareholders on Sept. 13.  
 Aevum hasn’t received any better offers to date, Edwards
wrote.
