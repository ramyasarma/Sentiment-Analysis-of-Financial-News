             Excelerate Energy LLC, a Texas-
based natural-gas trader, said it will build a liquefied natural
gas terminal in Argentina for a group headed by Spain’s  Repsol
YPF SA .  
 The terminal, expected to be completed by May 2011, will
deliver 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day,
Excelerate said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 The LNG terminal will be the second such port in Argentina.
Excelerate built the first one, operated by the same Repsol-led
group. State-controlled energy company Enarsa also has a stake
in the group.  
 Argentina has faced energy shortages during Southern
Hemisphere winters since 2004 as economic growth spurred demand.
Industrial consumers such as Dow Chemical Co. and Siderar SAIC
had shortages in August as the country experienced the coldest
winter in 40 years. Argentina doubled shipments of LNG imports
to 14 this year to address the shortages.  
 The new terminal will be located on the Parana River near
the city of Escobar in the central province of Buenos Aires. A
150,900-cubic-meter regasification ship will be docked at the
terminal, Excelerate said.  
 Excelerate is half-owned by U.S. billionaire George Kaiser
and the rest by  RWE AG , Germany’s second-biggest utility.
Repsol’s local unit, YPF SA, is Argentina’s largest energy
company.
