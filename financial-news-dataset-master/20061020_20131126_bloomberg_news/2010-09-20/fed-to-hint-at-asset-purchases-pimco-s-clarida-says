             The Federal Reserve will prepare
investors for additional purchases of securities to keep
borrowing costs low when policy makers meet tomorrow, Pacific
Investment Management Co.’s  Richard Clarida  said.  
 “The Fed’s rhetoric will get the markets ready for the
real possibility of expanding their  balance sheet  at a later
meeting this year,” Clarida, a Columbia University professor
and global strategic adviser for Pimco, said in a radio
interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  
 The central bank bought $300 billion of U.S. government
securities last year in a policy known as quantitative easing.
It announced on Aug. 10 it would reinvest principal payments
from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed
securities in longer-term  Treasuries , spurring speculation the
purchases would be expanded if the economic recovery showed
signs of floundering.  
 Twenty seven of 58 economists polled by Bloomberg News this
month see growth in 2011 below the 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent
pace Fed policy makers peg as the long-term trend. Twenty eight
see the  jobless rate  rising above last month’s 9.6 percent
sometime in the next nine months. That combination would
constitute a growth recession.  
 Divisions of opinion at the Fed about the extent of the
need for further stimulus make it more likely that the central
bank commits to purchasing Treasuries in an amount closer to
$500 billion than $1 trillion, Clarida said.  
 Fed Purchases  
 “There’s a split on the committee,” he said. “I would be
surprised, knowing what I know now, if they went for a shock-
and-awe number of $1 trillion, but you certainly can’t rule that
out.”  
 The Fed has bought $28.102 billion of securities since it
began the reinvestment program on Aug. 17. Policy makers are
seeking to keep holdings in the System Open Market Account, or
SOMA, at about $2 trillion.  
 “Whenever you pursue a non-traditional policy” it’s
possible the market will misinterpret the intentions of policy
makers, Clarida said. “A big  program  could signal even greater
concern than the markets have already priced in.”  
 The longest and deepest U.S. recession since the Great
Depression ended in June 2009, lasting 18 months, the National
Bureau of Economic Research said today. Marked by a collapse in
housing and sub-prime mortgage lending that triggered a global
meltdown in financial markets, the downturn trailed the 43-month
Great Depression that lasted from 1929 to 1933, surpassing the
16-month contractions of 1973-75 and 1981-82.  
 Pimco’s $248 billion  Total Return Fund , the world’s largest
mutual fund, handed investors a 10 percent gain in the past
year, beating 67 percent of its competitors, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
