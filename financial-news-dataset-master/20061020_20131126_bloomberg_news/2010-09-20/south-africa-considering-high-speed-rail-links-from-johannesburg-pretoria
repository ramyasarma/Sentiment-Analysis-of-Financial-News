             South Africa is considering plans
to run three high-speed rail links from Johannesburg and another
from Pretoria, the Department of Transport said in a written
reply to questions in Parliament.  
 There are proposals to build a network for trains designed
to travel faster than 200 kilometers an hour from Johannesburg
to Cape Town, Johannesburg to Polokwane in the Limpopo province
and Johannesburg to the eastern port city of Durban, the
department said in the reply, dated Sept. 17 and e-mailed today.
Studies to determine the feasibility of the projects are still
underway, it said.  
 A feasibility study has been completed into the 9.3 billion
rand Moloto Corridor, the department said, which will link
Pretoria and the Mpumalanga province.
