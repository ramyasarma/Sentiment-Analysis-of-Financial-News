             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index gained
the most in a week after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
measure will rally to a record this year and economists
increased forecasts for economic growth.  
 Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA, the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, gained the most in two weeks on speculation
U.K. airline Flybe may order more jets.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA ,
Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, gained as crude prices
jumped.  Rossi Residencial SA  and Lojas Renner SA led gains for
homebuilders and retailers as economists in a central bank
survey increased estimates for economic growth.  
 “Domestic growth is strong,” said  Carlos Eduardo Ramos ,
who helps oversees 12 billion reais ($6.93 billion) as senior
portfolio manager for BNY Mellon Arx in Rio de Janeiro. “What’s
holding us back are doubts about growth in the U.S. and
abroad.”  
 The Bovespa index rose 1.6 percent to 68,190.46. Sixty
stocks gained on the index while eight fell. The  BM&FBovespa
Small Cap index  added 0.7 percent to 1,342.77. The real fell 0.6
percent to 1.7316 per dollar, from 1.7213 on Sept. 17.  
 Brazilian economists expect the economy to grow 7.47
percent in 2010, from a previous estimate of 7.42 percent,
according to a weekly survey by the central bank published
today. Brazilian inflation will end 2011 at 4.95 percent, up
from a week earlier forecast of 4.90 percent, the survey showed.  
 ‘Continuity’  
 Dilma Rousseff , the chosen successor of President  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva, may bring “continuity” and seek to
contain government spending if she wins elections next month,
according to Goldman Sachs. Support for the former cabinet chief
is at 51 percent, compared to 25 percent for her closest
competitor, according to an Ibope poll published Sept. 17.  
 “Timing for a rally seems propitious because obstacles
that have blocked markets are being removed, while earnings are
robust and estimates we think will rise further,”  Stephen Graham  and  Andre Rezende , analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
note to clients today. “The implications of flat rather than
rising interest rates into 2011 are sinking in.”  
 Rossi gained 3.4 percent to 16.38 reais. Lojas Renner
advanced 2.8 percent to 56.29 reais.  
 Embraer gained 3.9 percent to 12.15 reais. Flybe, the
U.K.’s biggest domestic carrier, in July ordered 35 Embraer jets
worth $1.3 billion, with options for 65 planes and “purchase
rights” for a further 40. The airline’s Chief Executive Officer
 Jim French  said today the company is in talks to make two
acquisitions to expand in Europe, boosting the prospects for
increasing jet orders, according to  Rosangela Ribeiro  of SLW
Corretora.  
 “If that outlook exists, the effect on the stock is
positive, because it improves the order backlog,” said Ribeiro,
an analyst at the Sao Paulo-based brokerage, who recommends
buying Embraer’s shares.  
 Petrobras rallied 2.5 percent to 27.10 reais. Crude rose
for the first time in five days after equities advanced,
signaling that economic growth will accelerate.
