             M&T Bank Corp.  may give up a
majority stake to  Banco Santander SA  through a merger with the
Spanish lender’s U.S. unit, while retaining some elements of
control, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  
 The banks are in informal talks with the U.S. Federal
Reserve to gauge how such a deal would be received, and expect
to hear back within two weeks, said the people, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the talks are private. Many of
the terms, including the timing of when Santander would get the
majority stake, have yet to be worked out, the people said.  
 An agreement would allow Santander to put its Sovereign
Bank unit, which had pretax losses for the past three years,
under the  management  of M&T Chief Executive Officer  Robert Wilmers , 76, and his team, the people said. Buffalo, New York-
based M&T, which counts  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
among its biggest  shareholders , steered through the financial
crisis without posting a loss.  
 “M&T is, in our view, an extremely well-run bank,” said
 Gerard Cassidy , an analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Portland,
Maine, in a telephone interview. A deal placing M&T in control
of U.S. operations would be favorable to M&T’s shareholders,
“because we’d expect M&T to be able to drive its efficiencies
into the combined companies to make the bank very profitable.”  
 M&T has a  market value  of more than $10 billion. Together,
M&T and Sovereign, which are about the same size, would become
the ninth-largest U.S. savings institution by deposits.  
 Compromise Floated  
 M&T and Santander have been in intermittent merger talks
for months, with Santander seeking a takeover of M&T, and M&T
aiming to combine with Sovereign without submitting to the
control of the Spanish bank, the people said. The proposal being
floated to federal regulators represents a compromise between
those two positions, one of the people said.  
 M&T’s shares rose 5 percent to $91 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock is up 36 percent
this year.  
 Spokesmen for M&T and Santander declined to comment. A
spokeswoman for the Fed in Washington declined to comment.  
 The transaction would probably be structured as a stock
merger, in which Santander trades its holding of the Sovereign
unit for shares in M&T, said one of the people. Santander may
start with a minority holding in M&T with an option that allows
it to increase ownership to more than 50 percent within a few
years, the people said.  
 Santander, based in the Spanish city of the same name, is
in talks to acquire Allied Irish Banks Plc’s 22.5 percent stake
in  M&T , the people said.  Catherine Burke , a spokeswoman for
Allied Irish, declined to comment.  
 Acquisition Spree  
 Santander  has been on an acquisition spree this year,
agreeing to buy a portfolio of car loans from HSBC Holdings Plc
for $4 billion, Allied Irish’s 70 percent stake in a Polish bank
for $3.7 billion, and 318 bank branches from Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  
 Sovereign had $72.6 billion of assets and $41.6 billion of
deposits as of June 30, according to data from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. M&T had $67.3 billion of assets and
$47.5 billion of deposits.  
 At Sovereign, where Santander bought a minority stake in
2005, losses and customer withdrawals forced it to seek a rescue
from Santander, which bought the rest of it last year.  
 Wilmers negotiated protections to preserve control in at
least one previous transaction. In 2002, he agreed to buy Allied
Irish’s Allfirst Financial unit for stock and cash, giving the
Dublin-based bank its holding and adding more than 700 branches.
Under the deal, Allied Irish agreed to limit its stake to 25
percent and to add Wilmers to its board of directors.
