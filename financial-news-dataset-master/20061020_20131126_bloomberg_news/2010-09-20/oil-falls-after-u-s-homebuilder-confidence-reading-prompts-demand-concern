             Oil fell after a report showed that
confidence among U.S. homebuilders in September unexpectedly
held at the lowest level in more than a year, adding to concern
that a recovery in fuel demand may falter.  
 Futures gave back some of yesterday’s 1.6 percent gain
after the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
confidence index was unchanged at 13, matching the August
reading as the lowest since March 2009. The gauge was projected
to rise to 14, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “This should be a choppy, sideways market for the next
four or five weeks, unless we get signs the economy is picking
up,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  
 The October contract dropped as much as 63 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $74.23 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $74.27 at 10:01 a.m. Sydney
time. Yesterday it climbed $1.20 to $74.86, the biggest gain
since Sept. 10. Prices are down 6.4 percent this year.  
 Unemployment in the U.S. may hold above pre-recession
levels until at least 2013 as the economic recovery is
restrained by Americans paying down debt and a decline in
household net worth, according to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.  
 An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
that stockpiles of distillate fuel, including heating oil and
diesel, increased 250,000 barrels last week, a Bloomberg News
survey shows, the first increase in four weeks.  
 Oil Inventories  
 U.S. crude supplies probably slipped 1.6 million barrels
from 357.4 million, according to the survey. Gasoline stockpiles
decreased 250,000 barrels from 224.5, the survey shows.  
 Refineries probably operated at 86.8 percent of capacity,
down 0.8 percentage point from the previous week, according to
the survey. It would be the lowest utilization rate since the
week ended April 16.  
 Oil increased yesterday as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced to the highest level since May, after Lennar Corp., the
fourth-largest U.S. homebuilder, beat profit estimates and
International Business Machines Corp. announced a deal to
acquire Netezza Corp. The longest U.S. recession since the Great
Depression ended in June 2009, lasting 18 months, the National
Bureau of Economic Research said.  
 Brent crude oil for November settlement traded at $79.20,
down 12 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
It rose $1.11, or 1.4 percent, to $79.32 yesterday.
