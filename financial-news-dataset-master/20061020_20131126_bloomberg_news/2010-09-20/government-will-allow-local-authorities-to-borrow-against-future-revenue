             Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
said the U.K. government will let local councils borrow against
future income from local business tax to fund infrastructure
projects such as roads and bridges in their areas.  
 So-called Tax Increment Financing will allow local
authorities to raise money against a possible future additional
rise in business rates that would be the result of encouraging
companies to expand in an area with better business facilities.
The resulting bigger tax yield is intended to allow local
councils to pay off the debt.  
 “Labour rattled on about decentralization, but they held
the purse strings tight,” Clegg said in a speech today to his
party’s annual conference in Liverpool, northwest England. “We
will allow councils to keep some of the extra business rates and
council tax they raise when they enable new developments to go
ahead.”  
 Local authorities will need to manage the costs and risk of
this borrowing, the Liberal Democrats, the junior partners to
the Conservatives in Britain’s coalition government, said in an
e-mailed statement. The central government will not underwrite
any projects.  
 “Labour pioneered new borrowing freedoms for councils in
our March budget,” the opposition Labour Party’s Treasury
spokesman  Liam Byrne  said in an e-mail. “But all the freedom in
the world, I’m afraid, won’t make up for Tory budget cuts that
are so fast and so deep that communities across our country will
be scarred with higher unemployment.”
