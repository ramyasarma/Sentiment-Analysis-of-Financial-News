             The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
will surge to 1,300 through the end of next year because of
investor sentiment, stock valuations and depressed earnings
estimates, Citigroup said.  
 The gauge will rise 15 percent from its closing level of
1,125.59 last week, and end 2010 at 1,175,  Tobias Levkovich , the
firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist, said in a Sept. 17 note.  
 “It appears that 2011 should provide solid gains for
equity investors,” Levkovich said. “Stock-market investors
could enjoy an aggregate total return of roughly 20 percent in
the next 15 months or so.”  
 Citigroup’s investor-sentiment model shows a 97 percent
chance that stock prices will be higher in a year. The current
price-to-earnings ratio signals an 85 percent chance of a rise
over the same period, the report said. The S&P 500’s  P/E ratio 
is 14.8 using the past year of earnings. Also, “the market is
implying declines in future earnings, which historically has
generated highly respectable 20 percent-plus strength.”  
 S&P 500 companies will post 36 percent profit growth in
2010, the fastest increase since 1988, and a 15 percent rise in
2011, according to the average analyst earnings estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Smaller stocks may outperform big ones, Levkovich added,
citing a higher probability that companies with lower market
capitalizations would be taken over.  
 Risks to the 1,300 estimate include “policy errors and
growing debt burdens,” Levkovich said, citing concern about
government debt levels and possible changes to tax policy. He
cited the Office of Management and Budget’s projection that net
federal government debt to gross domestic product would reach 75
percent by 2017, and noted that “tax policy will have to be
addressed given the expiring Bush tax cuts.”
