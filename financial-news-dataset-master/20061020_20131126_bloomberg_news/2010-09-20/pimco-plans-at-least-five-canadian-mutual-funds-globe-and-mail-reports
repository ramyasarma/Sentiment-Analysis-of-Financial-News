             Pacific Investment Management Co.
plans to establish at least five mutual funds in Canada that
would go on sale early next year, the Globe and Mail reported.  
 The funds would be aimed at individual investors and would
likely have lower management fees because of Pimco’s large
scale, the Toronto-based newspaper said today, citing
unidentified people.  
 Pimco, which has had a Canadian office since 2004, has
catered primarily to pension plans in the country, the Globe
said.
