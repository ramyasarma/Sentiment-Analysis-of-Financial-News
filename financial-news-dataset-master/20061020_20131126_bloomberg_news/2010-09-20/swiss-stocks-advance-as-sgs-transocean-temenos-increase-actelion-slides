             Swiss stocks advanced, snapping a
four-day losing streak, as gains in SGS SA and luxury-goods
makers offset a loss in Actelion Ltd.  
 SGS climbed 5.4 percent after it announced plans to
increase its sales by 70 percent by 2014. Cie. Financiere
Richemont SA increased 2.9 percent and Swatch Group AG rose 3.1
percent.  Temenos Group AG  climbed 2.6 percent as Morgan Stanley
resumed coverage of the software company with an “overweight”
rating. Actelion fell 3.9 percent as U.S. prosecutors requested
documents about its lung drug Tracleer.  
 The  Swiss Market Index  gained 72.96, or 1.1 percent, to
6,461.98 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich. The measure has
gained 8.8 percent since this year’s low on July 5 as concern
abated that efforts by European governments to scale back
spending may tip the continent’s economy into recession. The
broader  Swiss Performance Index  also added 1.1 percent today.  
 “Short-term markets have had a very good rebound,” said
 Lars Schickentanz , chief investment officer at Prima Sgr in
Milan. “I think we need positive news on QE2 to sustain that,
but on a six-month view markets will go up,” while “sovereign
concerns will be with us for years.”  
 Swiss Economy  
 In Switzerland, the KOF research institute said today that
the country’s economy will expand at a faster pace than
previously estimated in 2010, led by surging demand for exports.  
 Gross domestic product will rise 2.7 percent this year and
1.8 percent in 2011, the Zurich-based institute said. In June,
it forecast the economy would expand 1.8 percent this year and
1.6 percent next year.  
 SGS  surged 5.4 percent to 1,694 Swiss francs as the world’s
biggest goods inspector said it plans to generate 8 billion
Swiss francs ($8 billion) of revenue by 2014 as it targets
acquisitions to add services and markets.  
 SGS also aims for earnings per share of about 140 francs by
2014, helped by “strong organic growth” as well as purchases,
the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 “We like these new targets, as the margin target sets the
bar high in terms of further productivity gains and the
sales/EBITA targets imply a substantial gearing up of SGS’s
under-utilized balance sheet,” Credit Agricole Cheuvreux SA
said in a note.  
 Richemont , the world’s largest jewelry maker, increased 2.9
percent to 45.10 francs and  Swatch , the maker of Omega and
Breguet watches, jumped 3.1 percent to 363.60 francs. Pandora
A/S, the Danish jeweler planning an initial public offering,
said its share sale will value the business at as much as 29.2
billion kroner ($5.13 billion), making it Denmark’s ninth-
largest listed company.  
 Novartis AG  added 1 percent to 56.80 francs as its Onbrez
Breezhaler was more effective than a standard medicine in a
late-stage study of patients with smoker’s cough.  
 Temenos Climb  
 Temenos  advanced 2.6 percent to 29.85 francs. Morgan
Stanley resumed coverage of the stock with an “overweight”
recommendation, saying in a note that it expects “Temenos to
benefit from banks resuming the move to packaged software, which
accelerated in 2006 and was interrupted by the financial
crisis.”  
 Adecco SA , the world’s largest supplier of temporary
workers, advanced 1.3 percent to 51.30 francs. Vontobel AG said
that “recent temporary staffing data for August out of the U.S.
and France continue to be supportive and show solid double-digit
growth.”  
 Actelion, Orascom Fall  
 Actelion  fell 3.9 percent to 44.06 francs. Switzerland’s
largest biotechnology company said U.S. prosecutors have
requested documents about marketing and sales practices for its
lung drug Tracleer.  
 Actelion will co-operate with the investigation, which was
opened by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District
of California, the Allschwil, Switzerland-based company said in
a statement today.  
 Orascom Development Holding AG  sank 4.7 percent to 52.70
francs. The biggest publicly traded resorts builder in Egypt,
said it will sell 4.99 million new shares with a face value of
23.85 francs per share, the Altdorf, Switzerland-based company
said in an advertisement in Cairo-based Al Mal newspaper.  
 Rieter Holding AG  dropped 6.8 percent to 282.25 francs.
Helvea SA downgraded the world’s largest maker of staple-fiber
spinning machines to “neutral” from “buy” to take into
account revised assumptions for the textile machinery business.
