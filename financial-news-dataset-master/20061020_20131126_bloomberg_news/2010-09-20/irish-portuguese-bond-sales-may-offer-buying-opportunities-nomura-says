             Bond sales this week by Ireland and
Portugal offer investors “good buying opportunities” after the
debt’s recent declines, Nomura International Plc said.  
 “The concessions that are likely to be built into the
curves ahead of this week’s auctions may create good buying
opportunities given the recent tendency for actual peripheral
sales to be smooth,” a team of European interest-rate
strategists led by Nick Firoozye  in London wrote today in an
investor note. “We remain constructive on Ireland relative to
current pricing.”
