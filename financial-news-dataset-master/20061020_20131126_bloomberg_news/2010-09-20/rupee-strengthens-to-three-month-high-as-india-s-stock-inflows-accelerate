             India’s rupee climbed to a three-
month high on speculation accelerating capital flows into the
local stock market will offset the nation’s record  current-
account  deficit.  
 The currency appreciated in each of the last three weeks as
foreigners bought $2.6 billion more Indian equities than they
sold this month, exceeding the $2.4 billion the stock exchange
recorded for the whole of August. Asia’s third-largest economy
expanded  8.8 percent  last quarter, the fastest pace since 2007,
a government report showed Aug. 31.  
 “Capital inflows may surprise on the upside as India’s
economic prospects remain positive,” said  Priyanka Chakravarty ,
a Mumbai-based foreign-exchange strategist at Standard Chartered
Plc. “The rupee is poised to extend recent gains as sustained
portfolio investments may overwhelm trade deficit concerns.”  
 The rupee strengthened 0.4 percent to 45.655 per dollar as
of 10:14 a.m. in Mumbai, building on a 1.4 percent advance last
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
today touched 45.595, the strongest level since June 21. It has
climbed 3.1 percent this month, a performance second only to
South Korea’s won among Asian currencies.  
 Offshore forwards indicated the rupee will trade at 46.15
to the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
46.43 at the end of last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or
sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts
are settled in dollars.
