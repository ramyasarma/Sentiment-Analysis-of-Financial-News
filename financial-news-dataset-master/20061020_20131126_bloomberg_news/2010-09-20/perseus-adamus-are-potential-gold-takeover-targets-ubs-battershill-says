             Perseus Mining Ltd.  and  Adamus
Resources Ltd. , Australian gold companies with projects in West
Africa, are potential targets for larger producers looking for
acquisitions to grow, UBS AG said.  
 “The quality of assets will continue to attract corporate
appeal during an active M&A environment,”  Jo Battershill , a UBS
analyst, said in a report dated Sept. 17. UBS initiated coverage
of both companies with “buy” ratings. “Investors
are focusing on the corporate appeal of all almost producers.”  
 Gold’s climb to a record this year has pushed acquisitions
in the sector to an all-time high, with Kinross Gold Corp.’s
C$7.4 billion ($7.2 billion) takeover of Red Back Mining Inc.,
the latest in West Africa. Bullion for immediate delivery rose
0.6 percent to $1,282.35 an ounce at 4:37 p.m. in Sydney, taking
its gain for the year to 17 percent.  
 Perseus gained 8.3 percent to A$3.25 at the 4:10 p.m. close
in Sydney and Adamus advanced 7.2 percent to 68 cents. Newcrest
Mining Ltd., Australia’s largest gold producer, dropped 0.3
percent to A$41.39.  
 Perseus, based in Perth and with a market value of A$1.37
billion ($1.29 billion), is developing the Central Ashanti gold
project in southern Ghana and the Tengrela project in Ivory
Coast. Central Ashanti is set to start output in the third
quarter next year, with average production of 275,000 ounces a
year over 13 years, UBS said.  
 Adamus , also based in Perth, plans to commission its Nzema
gold project in Ghana in December, with first output likely in
March next year, UBS said. Production is set to reach an average
100,000 ounces annually over 10 years.  
 “The project could hold appeal to other gold producers
with operations in Ghana, or to companies looking to get a small
foothold in Ghana,” Battershill said.  
 Gold may reach at least $1,300 an ounce this year as
investors seek a shield against financial turmoil, weak
currencies and inflation,  Paul Walker , the chief executive
officer of London-based researcher GFMS Ltd., said in an
interview last month.
