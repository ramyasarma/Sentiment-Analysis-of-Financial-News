             Standard Chartered Bank Ltd.  urged
a Hong Kong judge to throw out a local beauty tycoon’s lawsuit,
with the bank’s lawyer claiming the business owner didn’t suffer
any losses on her Lehman Brothers-related investment.  
 Joyce Tsang Yue , chairwoman and founder of  Modern Beauty
Salon Holdings Ltd. , can’t sue as a beneficiary of a trust that
incurred the investment losses, Russell Coleman, a lawyer
representing the bank, said at a hearing today.  
 “If there is a claim, it’s a claim that belongs to the
trust,” Coleman said. “This plaintiff has no standing to
sue.”  
 Tsang filed a $1.65 million (HK$12.9 million) claim against
Standard Chartered in December after she invested, on the
recommendation of a bank employee, some of the trust’s funds in
a product linked to bankrupt  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ,
according to her lawyer Edward Chan.  
 “The plaintiff acted on negligent, alternatively reckless,
advice resulting in her suffering tangible loss,” Chan said.  
 The trustee in Tsang’s claim against Standard Chartered is
Standard Chartered Trust (Cayman) Limited, which her lawyer Chan
described as being “of the same group” as the bank. The
trustee declined to sue the bank at Tsang’s request.  
 Tsang’s proper recourse is to ask a court in the
Cayman Islands to compel the trust to sue, Coleman said.  
 Judge Arjan Sakhrani of the Court of First Instance
reserved his decision.  
 Tsang sued Goldman Sachs & Co. and one of its
employees  Ronnie Wong , last year for making unauthorized trades
on her behalf. Wong was banned in July by the Securities and
Futures Commission from the industry for two years after
admitting to making the trades.  
 The case is  Tsang Yue Joyce  and Standard Chartered Bank
(Hong Kong) Ltd., Standard Chartered Trust (Cayman) Ltd.,
HCA2488/2009 in the High Court of Hong Kong.
