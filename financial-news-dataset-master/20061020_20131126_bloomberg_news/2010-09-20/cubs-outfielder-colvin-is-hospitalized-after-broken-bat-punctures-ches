             Chicago Cubs outfielder  Tyler Colvin  will miss the rest of the season after a broken bat
punctured his chest.  
 Colvin was injured during yesterday’s 13-3 win against the
host Florida Marlins. He was on third base in the second inning
when the bat of Cubs catcher  Welington Castillo  broke on a
double to left field. As Colvin looked to see where the ball was
going to land, a piece of the splintered bat struck him in the
chest near his left collarbone.  
 Colvin, a 25-year-old Major League Baseball rookie,
released a statement through the team today saying that he was
“doing OK” and thanking medical personnel. The team said
Colvin was in stable condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital in
Miami. He will remain in the hospital for a few days.  
 “You never want to have a season end early, and I’m
disappointed that I’m not going to be able to make it through
the finish line with the rest of my teammates,” Colvin said.  
 Doctors inserted a tube in the chest opening yesterday in a
procedure designed to prevent Colvin’s lung from collapsing,
 MLB.com  reported.  
 “I’m amazed it doesn’t happen more often,” MLB.com cited
Cubs manager  Mike Quade  as saying. “Over the last 10 years,
I’ve seen a lot of projectiles out there. Sometimes I’ve seen it
happen three or four times a night where bats get snapped in
half.”  
 Colvin, the Cubs’ first-round pick in the 2006 draft, was
hitting .254 with 20 home runs and 56 runs batted in over 135
games this season.
