             Coffee prices in New York fell the
most in almost four weeks as wet weather may limit crop damage
from a dry spell in Brazil, the world’s largest producer. Cocoa
and sugar declined  
 Rain is forecast most of next week for the coffee-growing
regions in Brazil, mainly in the Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo
states, said  Joel Widenor , the director of agriculture services
at the Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland. Last
week, prices fell 0.3 percent on signs of increasing supplies.  
 “Perhaps the threat of dry weather is dissipating,” said
 Raymond Keane , a Balzac Bros. trader in Charleston, South
Carolina. “The rains are starting to increase. That will be
good for the coffee.”  
 Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 7.35
cents, or 3.9 percent, to settle at $1.8195 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. at 2 p.m. in New York. That’s the biggest decline
for a most-active contract since Aug. 24.  
 In London, robusta-coffee futures for November delivery
fell $15, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $1,654 a ton on NYSE
Liffe at 5:30 p.m. local time.  
 Trees in Minas Gerais, which produces more than half of
Brazil’s coffee, flower this month through November. Humidity is
needed during this period to ensure coffee buds will develop
properly. The buds turn into beans that growers will start
harvesting in April.  
 Sugar Prices  
 Raw sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.17 cent, or 0.7
percent, to settle at 23.08 cents a pound in New York. Earlier,
the commodity touched 23.95 cents, the highest price for a most-
active contract since March 1.  
 In London, refined sugar futures for December delivery
dropped 50 cents to settle at $607.80 a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe.  
 Adverse weather in recent months points to “lower-than-
previously-expected production” for Australia and Brazil, the
biggest grower and exporter, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a
report on Sept. 17. The bank boosted its three-month price
forecast by 33 percent.  
 Cocoa futures for December delivery retreated $30, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $2,716 a ton. In London, futures of the
chocolate ingredient for December delivery lost 19 pounds, or 1
percent, to 1,865 pounds ($2,900) a ton at 4:52 p.m. local time.  
 Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 0.5 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to settle at $1.504 a pound in New York. The
commodity has gained 17 percent this year.
