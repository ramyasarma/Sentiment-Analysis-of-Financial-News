             More Chinese households forecast
that consumer prices will rise in the next quarter, a central
bank  survey  showed.  
 The proportion rose to 46.2 percent in the third quarter
from 42.4 percent in the previous three months, the People’s
Bank of China said on its website yesterday, citing a sample of
20,000 households in 50 cities.  
 Investment bank China International Capital Corp. said last
week that inflation may peak in October then slow by year-end
after  rising  to a 22-month high in August. Of those surveyed,
58.3 percent said prices are “too high to accept,” down 0.6
percentage point from the previous quarter.  
 A seasonally-adjusted inflation expectation index dropped
0.6 percentage point to 70.7 percent, the central bank said.
Without adjustment, the index rose 2.9 percentage points to 73.2
percent, the central bank said.  
 August’s inflation rate was 3.5 percent.
