             Australian private equity funds aim
to attract A$4 billion in new capital before the end of the
year, the largest amount in two years, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing the fund groups.  
 Some buyout groups may find it difficult to raise money
from investors, who are skeptical they will deliver strong
returns, the newspaper said. Quadrant Private Equity is set to
start raising about A$600 million, the newspaper said, without
saying where it got the information.
