             HSBC Holdings Plc  has started an
Internet-based transaction platform in Hong Kong for U.S.
stocks, the Standard said, citing Francesca McDonagh, HSBC’s
head of personal financial services in the city.  
 Only about 2 percent of Hong Kong people have purchased
U.S. stocks, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper said
today. HSBC will charge $18 in fees for the first 1,000 shares
of each trade and 1.5 cents for each additional share, the
Standard said.
