             BMI, the second-biggest airline at
London’s Heathrow airport, is poised to begin pay talks with the
Unite union against a backdrop of threatened legal action by the
labor organization.  
 Talks over a pay freeze imposed since April 2009 will
resume this month, BMI spokesman Aaron Lupton said today in a
telephone interview from the carrier’s headquarters in Castle
Donington, central England.  
 “Constructive talks between BMI and Unite union
representatives are ongoing,” Lupton said.  
 Unite wrote to BMI Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Prock-
Shauer on Sept. 8 saying it would begin High Court proceedings
against the carrier if it failed to make progress on a new pay
agreement within 30 says, spokeswoman Pauline Doyle said today
in an e-mail.  
 BMI and Unite agreed to defer a pay increase due for
2009-2010 after the recession undermined demand for air travel.
That accord doesn’t apply to the current fiscal year that began
on April 1, the union says.  
 “Suddenly they’re keen to talk,” Doyle said. “We will be
happy to do so, but the court action goes ahead.”
