             Hurricane Igor is on its way to a
close call with Newfoundland after lashing Bermuda earlier today
with gusts up to 93 mph.  
 Tropical storm warnings were posted in Newfoundland, where
moisture from Igor is forecast to mix with other systems to
produce as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain tomorrow,
according to a 5 p.m. advisory from the  National Hurricane
Center  in Miami.  
 The storm is 725 miles (1,166 kilometers) southwest of Cape
Race, Newfoundland, with top winds of 75 miles per hour, the
center said. Igor is expected to lose its tropical status, an
indication it isn’t drawing power from the ocean, and be picked
up by a weather front, the center said.  
 “Igor should be fully incorporated into the frontal zone
by 24 hours,” according to a center forecast analysis.  
 Igor passed just 40 miles off Bermuda’s coast overnight.
About 21,500 utility customers were still without power as of 1
p.m., according to Bermuda Electric Light Co.’s website. The
airport causeway, closed by the storm, reopened at 3 p.m. local
time, the  Bermuda Emergency Measures Organization  said.  
 In advance of Igor’s arrival, Canada issued a tropical
storm warning for Newfoundland from Stone’s Cove to
Charlottetown.  
 The U.S. center forecasts Igor will bypass Newfoundland
tomorrow, then veer northward toward Greenland while still at
tropical-storm strength on Sept. 24.  
 For now, the storm remains “large” with hurricane-force
winds of at least 74 mph stretching 85 miles from its center and
tropical-storm-force winds of at least 39 mph extending out
about 380 miles, the Miami-based center said. Igor is a Category
1 storm, the lowest on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale.  
 East of  Igor , a low-pressure system 450 miles west of the
Cape Verde Islands has an  80 percent chance  of becoming a
tropical cyclone during the next two days, the center said. A
cyclone is a rotating storm ranging from a depression to a
hurricane.  
 Tropical Storm Julia lost its cyclonic qualities today over
the central Atlantic.
