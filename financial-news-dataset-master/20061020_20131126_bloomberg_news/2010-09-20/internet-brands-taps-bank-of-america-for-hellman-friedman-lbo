             Internet Brands Inc. , the media
company started by Idealab that owns and operates more than 100
websites, got commitments from four banks to help pay for its
$640 million leveraged buyout by Hellman & Friedman.  
 Bank of America Corp., Bank of Montreal, General Electric
Capital Corp. and Royal Bank of Canada agreed to provide debt
financing for the transaction, the El Segundo, California-based
Internet Brands said in a statement today.  
 Hellman & Friedman, a private-equity firm with offices in
New York, London and San Francisco that is currently investing a
fund with more than $8 billion of committed capital, agreed to
acquire Internet Brands for $13.35 a share, 46.5 percent more
than the $9.11 close on Sept. 17 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading,
according to the statement. The stock rose $4.22 to $13.33 at
9:53 a.m. in New York.  
 Internet Brands said it expects the purchase will be
completed in the fourth quarter.
