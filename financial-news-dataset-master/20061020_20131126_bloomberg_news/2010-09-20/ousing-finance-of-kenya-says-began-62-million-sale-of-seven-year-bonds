             Housing Finance Ltd. , Kenya’s only
publicly traded mortgage company, today began the sale of 5
billion Kenyan shillings ($62 million) of bonds that mature in
seven years, the company said.  
 Bids for the securities will close on Oct. 1 while
settlement will take place on Oct. 11, the company said in a
statement published in the Nairobi-based Daily Nation newspaper
today.  
 The bonds, which will be listed on  Nairobi Stock Exchange ,
have a fixed interest rate of 8.5 percent. The floating rate is
3 percent above the 182-day treasury bill to a maximum of 9.5
percent and minimum of 5 percent, it said. In August the company
received regulatory approval for a 10 billion-shilling bond,
with today’s sale being the first portion, the company said.  
 The East African country’s urban areas need 150,000 housing
units a year compared with the 35,000 available at the moment,
resulting in overcrowding and informal settlements, the company
said Aug. 31. The purpose of the bonds is “onward lending to
clients and increase of housing supply,” the company said.  
 Kenya’s population rose by a third to 38.6 million in the
10 years to 2009, according to Planning Minister  Wycliffe Oparanya .
