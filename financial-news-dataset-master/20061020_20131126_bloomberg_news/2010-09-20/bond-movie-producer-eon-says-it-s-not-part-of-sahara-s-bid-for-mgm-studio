             EON Productions, producer of the
James Bond movies, said it isn’t involved in Sahara India
Pariwar’s bid for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., the debt-laden Los
Angeles film studio.  
 “EON Productions tonight confirmed they have never had any
contact with Sahara India Pariwar and are in no way involved in
the Sahara India Pariwar bid for MGM,” spokeswoman Stephanie
Wenborn said in a statement.  
 London-based EON, co-owner of the Bond franchise with MGM,
is involved in Sahara India’s bid, a person familiar with the
matter told Bloomberg News earlier. EON is run by Barbara
Broccoli and her stepbrother, Michael G. Wilson.  
 Sahara India, based in Lucknow, offered $2 billion for
MGM’s more than $3.7 billion in debt, the Associated Press
reported on Sept. 17.
