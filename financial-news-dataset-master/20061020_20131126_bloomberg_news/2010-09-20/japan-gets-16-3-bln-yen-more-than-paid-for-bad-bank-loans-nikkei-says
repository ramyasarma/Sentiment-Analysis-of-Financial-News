             Japan has recovered 16.3 billion
yen ($190 million) more in bad loans that it bought from
bankrupt financial companies than it paid for them, as of March
31, Nikkei English News reported, without saying where it got
the information.  
 The government bought bad loans through the Deposit
Insurance Corp. of Japan when sponsor companies took over a
failed bank, credit association or credit cooperative, Nikkei
said. Japan may not have more losses from these purchases,
Nikkei said.
