             Q-Cells SE’s convertible bonds rose
to the highest in almost two years after the solar-panel maker
said a $225 million loan it made to China’s LDK Solar will be
repaid early.  
 The German company’s 1.375 percent notes due 2012 climbed 5
cents in the euro to 83 percent of face value, according to
prices from Citigroup Inc.  
 The money will be paid in full by the end of 2011,
Thalheim-based Q-Cells said in a statement.  LDK  was due to make
stage payments on the debt to the end of 2015.  
 Jianxi-based LDK has already made an initial payment of
$56.2 million, according to the statement.  
 Q-Cells  shares  rose 7.6 cents, or 1.45 percent, to 5.316
euros ($7) at 11:18 a.m. in Frankfurt. The shares traded as high
as 99 euros in December 2007.
