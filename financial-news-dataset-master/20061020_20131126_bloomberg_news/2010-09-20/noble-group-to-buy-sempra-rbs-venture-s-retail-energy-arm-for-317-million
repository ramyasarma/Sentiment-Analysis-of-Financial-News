             Noble Group Ltd., a Hong Kong-based
commodities trader, agreed to buy a retail energy unit from a
joint venture between  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and
 Sempra Energy  for $317 million.  
 The sales of remaining stakes in the venture are being
negotiated, San Diego-based Sempra said today in a statement.
Noble Group is paying cash and will assume about $265 million
debt for the unit, which markets energy to commercial and
industrial customers in 16 U.S. states, Sempra said.  
 Sempra, the owner of the largest U.S. natural-gas utility,
expects to get about $1 billion from asset sales, Chief
Executive Officer  Donald Felsinger  said during a conference call
with investors on Aug. 3.  
 Royal Bank is being forced to sell the unit to comply with
European Union state-aid rules after getting 45.5 billion pounds
($70.9 billion) in the biggest bailout of a U.K. bank. The
lender bought a controlling stake in the Sempra venture in April
2008 as banks expanded commodity trading operations, driven by
rising investor interest in gold, oil and other raw materials.  
 On July 1, Sempra and Royal Bank completed a $1.6 billion
sale to JPMorgan Chase & Co. of the venture’s metals, oil and
European power and gas business for $1.6 billion.  
 Sempra rose 32 cents to $53.40 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Royal Bank, based in
Edinburgh, gained 2.5 percent to 49.02 pence in London. Noble
Group’s trading in Singapore was halted at S$1.79.
