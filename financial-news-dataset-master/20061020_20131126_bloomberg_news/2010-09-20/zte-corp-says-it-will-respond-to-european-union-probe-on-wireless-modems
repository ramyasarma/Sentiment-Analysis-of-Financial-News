             ZTE Corp. said it will be respond
to a European Union probe of whether Chinese wireless modems
receive trade-distorting government aid.  
 ZTE hasn’t been involved in dumping or subsidy activities
and the products at issue account for only a small part of the
company’s business, Guo Jianjun, a legal director at ZTE, said
at a press briefing in Beijing today.  
 Belgium’s Option NV, which has complained about unfair
competition, has suffered a decline in market share for reasons
other than Chinese companies’ activities, Guo said.
