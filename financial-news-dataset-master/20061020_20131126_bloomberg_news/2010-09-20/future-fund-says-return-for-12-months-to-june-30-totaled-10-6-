             Australia’s sovereign wealth fund,
the Future Fund, said its return for the year ended June 30 was
10.6 percent.  
 The figure excludes a 6.7 percent gain on the fund’s
Telstra Corp. stake, which the fund plans to cut “in an orderly
manner over the medium term,” it said in a statement today.  
 The outlook for global markets is “fragile,” the fund
said.
