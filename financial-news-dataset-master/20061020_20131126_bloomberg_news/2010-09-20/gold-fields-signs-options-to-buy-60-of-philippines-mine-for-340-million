             Gold Fields Ltd. , Africa’s second-
largest producer of the precious metal, signed an option to buy
60 percent of an undeveloped gold and copper deposit in the
Philippines for $340 million.  
 Gold Fields will pay an initial $10 million fee to Lepanto
Consolidated Mining Co. and $44 million to Liberty Express
Assets for the option to buy the Far Southeast deposit, the
Johannesburg-based mine operator said in a statement today.  
 The company is seeking to reduce its reliance on South
Africa, where it mines about 58 percent of its gold. Output of
the metal in Africa’s largest economy is declining and companies
are being forced to dig deeper to access shrinking reserves.
Gold Fields also has mines in Ghana, Australia and Peru.  
 “This transaction provides Gold Fields with a unique and
exciting opportunity to gain exposure to what will undoubtedly
prove to be a world-class deposit,” Chief Executive Officer
 Nick Holland  said in the statement.
