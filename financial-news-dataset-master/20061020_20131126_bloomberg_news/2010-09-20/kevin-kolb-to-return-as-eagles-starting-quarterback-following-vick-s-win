             Philadelphia Eagles quarterback
 Kevin Kolb  will return to his role as starter for the team’s
next game even after  Michael Vick ’s winning performance
yesterday.  
 Both Kolb and linebacker  Stuart Bradley  will start
Philadelphia’s game Sept. 26 at the Jacksonville Jaguars after
missing yesterday’s 35-32 win yesterday at the Detroit Lions
following Week 1 concussions, Eagles coach  Andy Reid  said.  
 “They’re good to go unless something crazy comes up,”
Reid said at a news conference today.  
 Kolb was knocked out of the Eagles’ season-opener because
of a second-quarter concussion. He was replaced by Vick, who led
the team to 17 second-half points in the 27-20 defeat.  
 Vick yesterday made his first start at quarterback since
Dec. 31, 2006. He was 21-for-34 passing for 284 yards.
