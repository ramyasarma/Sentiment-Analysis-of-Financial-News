             The Philippines started an offer to
sell and exchange as much as $3 billion of dollar-denominated
bonds due in 2021 and 2034 for existing shorter-dated notes,
helping the government lengthen its debt maturity.  
 The government will accept dollar notes due in 2011 to 2017
for new 10-year bonds, and securities maturing in 2019 to 2031
for additional 6.375 percent October 2034 debt it is issuing,
the government said. Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and UBS
AG are joint managers for the exchange, which will end at 5 p.m.
on Sept. 28, New York time.  
 The administration of President Benigno Aquino is seeking
to fix the nation’s finances in part by tapping new sources of
funds and stretching the average maturity of its debt. The
 budget  has been in deficit for 21 of the last 25 years and the
shortfall is projected to widen to a record 325 billion pesos
($7.4 billion) in 2010 from 298.5 billion pesos last year.  
 About $17.7 billion of bonds are qualified for the exchange,
according to terms of the offer e-mailed to investors. The
nation’s last dollar debt exchange was in September 2006, when
it issued about $1 billion of new bonds due in 2024 and 2031 for
shorter-dated notes, according to Bloomberg data. It has also
engaged in peso debt exchanges.  
 The Philippines is offering new January 2021 bonds to
investors that will yield from 149 basis points to 164 basis
points more than the equivalent interest-rate swap rate. The
2034 bonds are being marketed at a spread range of 148 basis
points to 163 basis points over the 4.375 percent U.S.
government debt maturing May 15, 2040, based on the terms e-
mailed to investors.  
 The Philippines on Sept. 10 raised $1 billion from its
first sale of 10-year global peso bonds. The government plans to
cut overseas debt sales to $2.5 billion in 2011 from a projected
$4.1 billion this year.
