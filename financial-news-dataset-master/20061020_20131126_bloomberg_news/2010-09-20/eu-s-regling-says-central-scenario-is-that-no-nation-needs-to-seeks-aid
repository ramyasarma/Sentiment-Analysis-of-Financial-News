             The head of Europe’s bailout fund
said he doesn’t expect any country will need to seek financial
assistance as governments cut their budget deficits.  
 “My central scenario is there is no need for the EFSF to
become operational,”  Klaus Regling , chief executive officer of
the European Financial Stability Facility, said in a telephone
interview with Bloomberg News today. “That’s based on the
assessment that all the member states are moving in the right
direction.”  
 Regling’s assessment comes as the yields that investors
demand to hold Irish and Portuguese debt over German bunds climb
to records amid renewed concern over their national finances.
Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service today gave their top
rating to the fund, which was created in May to halt the spread
of the Greek sovereign debt crisis.  
 “Now we can seriously talk to investors around the world
in case of the unlikely event we need to raise funds and provide
financial assistance to a member state,” said Regling, a former
European Commission official.
