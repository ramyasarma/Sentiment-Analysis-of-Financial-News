             The Carolina Panthers made
rookie quarterback  Jimmy Clausen  their Week 3 starter,
benching  Matt Moore .  
 Clausen, who turned professional following his junior
season at the University of Notre Dame, will lead the
Panthers Sept. 26 in their home game against the Cincinnati
Bengals, coach  John Fox  said today at a news conference.  
 Moore’s passer rating of 41.8 is the second lowest in
the National Football League, leading only  Joe Flacco  of
the Baltimore Ravens.  
 Moore had three interceptions and a fumble in a Week 1
loss at the New York Giants before leaving the game with a
concussion. He returned yesterday, throwing an interception
and losing another fumble before being replaced in the
fourth quarter as the Panthers dropped their home opener
against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  
 Clausen, the 48th pick in the April NFL draft, was 7-
for-15 passing for 59 yards and an interception in two
relief appearances.
