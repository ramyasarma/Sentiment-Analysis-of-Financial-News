             China should raise mortgage rates
and allow fixed-term deposit rates to float higher to curb
inflation expectations, said Ji Min, an official at the central
bank’s research bureau.  
 Mortgage rates are too low, fueling asset bubbles and
increasing lending risks, Ji wrote in the latest edition of
China Finance magazine in an article co-authored by Chang Li
from Tsinghua University.  
 Negative real interest rates prompted households to divert
savings to wealth management products and other investments this
year, leading to rapid price gains for property, gold and
agricultural products, Ji and Chang said.  
 Chinese banks could be allowed to offer “value-preserved”
savings accounts to reduce the impact of rising inflation on
depositors, they wrote in the magazine, which is supervised by
the People’s Bank of China. Chang’s title wasn’t specified.  
 China’s inflationary pressures are “mild” due to a
cooling economy, while the public’s expectations for price gains
are “stronger”, reflecting perceptions of excessive liquidity
and low interest rates worldwide and China’s record lending last
year, the researchers wrote. Easing domestic expectations for
policy tightening may also sustain inflation expectations, they
said.
