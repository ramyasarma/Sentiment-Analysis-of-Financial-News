             China plans to increase its minimum
wage by at least 20 percent annually in the next five years,
more than doubling it by 2015, to increase spending power and
consumption, the South China Morning Post said, citing Huang
Mengfu, a government adviser.  
 The government wants to increase domestic demand to ease
China’s dependence on exports and narrow the gap between rich
and poor, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper said
today, citing Huang, vice-chairman of the National Council of
Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and chairman
of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.  
 The government will propose reducing fees and charges on
factories in exchange for higher wages, the Post said.
