             Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  rose after U.S. homebuilder Lennar Corp. reported
better-than-estimated profit, boosting optimism in the economic
recovery worldwide.  
 American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. , a Japanese
maker of consumer electronics that gets more than 80 percent of
its sales abroad, gained 1.3 percent from the Tokyo close on
Sept. 17. Those of Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest
automaker, climbed 1.5 percent after the company said it will
almost double production capacity in China by 2012. ADRs of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company, climbed 0.8
percent from the Sydney close after oil and metal prices gained.  
 “Sentiment about the U.S. economy is improving, and
microeconomic factors such as company earnings are recovering,”
said  Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Co. “The market’s risk aversion is
declining, and there is growing confidence about the global
economic recovery.”  
 Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in December closed at 9,675 in Chicago yesterday, 1.7

provider of computer services, announced a $1.7 billion takeover.  
 Lennar, the third-largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue,
reported third-quarter profit of 16 cents a share, compared with
the median of about 3 cents forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 16
analysts, as margins on house sales improved and revenue climbed

possible U.S. slowdown. The increase lifted the average price of

integrated circuit parts and components.

Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain since Sept. 10. The  London
