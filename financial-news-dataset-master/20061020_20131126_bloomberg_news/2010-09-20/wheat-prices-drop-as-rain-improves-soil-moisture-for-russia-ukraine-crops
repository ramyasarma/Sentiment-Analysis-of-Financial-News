             Wheat fell for the fourth time in
five sessions as rain improved prospects for planting conditions
in Russia and Ukraine.  
 About 0.5 inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain fell in Russia and
Ukraine during the weekend, according to a report from
Accuweather.com. Wheat futures in Chicago are up 6.7 percent
this month, after drought reduced harvests in the two countries
and threatened planting of the winter crop.  
 “The Russians and Ukrainians are looking at a bit more
rain,” said  Mike Zuzolo , the president of Global Commodity
Analytics in Lafayette, Indiana. “They are going to get a
little bit more of jolt of precipitation and bolster their
subsoil moisture a little bit.”  
 Wheat futures for December delivery fell 7.5 cents, or 1
percent, to close at $7.3175 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have rallied 35 percent this year
on speculation that reduced production in Canada and Russia will
boost demand from other exporters.  
 The U.S. is the biggest shipper of the grain, followed by
Canada, Russia and Australia, according to the Department of
Agriculture.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
