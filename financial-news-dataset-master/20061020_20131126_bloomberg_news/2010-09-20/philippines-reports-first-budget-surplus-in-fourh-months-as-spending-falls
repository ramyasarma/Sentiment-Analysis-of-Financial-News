             The Philippines reported a  budget
surplus  in August for the first time in four months as spending
fell and revenue rose.  
 The surplus was 1.3 billion pesos ($29.5 million) last
month, the government said in a statement in Manila today.
 Spending  declined 9 percent in August from a year earlier after
a 1.9 percent gain previously  reported  for July, and revenue
rose 13.5 percent after growing 4.6 percent the previous month.  
 “They seem to be heading in the right direction, trying to
strengthen the tax collection and tightening spending,”  Sherman Chan , an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc. in Hong Kong, said
before the report. “The key challenge for them is to make sure
that all the plans they have announced will be carried out
properly. The fiscal deficit should really narrow in the coming
years.”  
 President  Benigno Aquino  is going after tax evaders and
corrupt officials to narrow a deficit forecast to reach a record
this year. Aquino will leave for the U.S. today to offer
investors at least 10 infrastructure projects worth 127.8
billion pesos ($2.9 billion) due to start next year as he seeks
to expand the  economy  by as much as 8 percent annually from 2011.  
 The Philippines has run deficits in 21 of the past 25 years,
limiting state spending on infrastructure to less than the 5
percent of gross domestic product recommended by the World Bank.
Aquino plans to narrow the budget gap to 290 billion pesos next
year from a projected 325 billion pesos in 2010.  
 The government will invite bids for infrastructure projects
worth 739.8 billion pesos over the next two years, Economic
Planning Deputy Director General Rolando Tungpalan said last
week. The $160 billion economy grew 7.9 percent last quarter,
the fastest pace in three years.
