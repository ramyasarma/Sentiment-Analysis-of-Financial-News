             The U.S. economy isn’t likely to
experience a slowdown in productivity that is needed for the 
labor market to recover, said an economist with the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco.  
 “Businesses have been able to meet demand for their
products and services without hiring new workers or increasing
the hours of current staff because they are managing to get more
from each hour of labor,” senior economist Daniel J. Wilson
wrote in a paper released by the bank today.  
 Labor productivity, or output per hour of work, grew at a
2.5 percent annual pace during the recession, which began in
December 2007 and ended last year, Wilson said. It’s grown an
even faster 2.8 percent since the recession concluded, one
reason that unemployment hasn’t dropped further, he wrote.  
 “A reasonably strong recovery in employment over the next
year or two” would require “a sharp slowdown in productivity
growth to about 1 percent or less,” Wilson said.  
 The unemployment rate, at 9.6 percent in August, has
remained above 9 percent since May 2009. The recession lasted 18
months and ended in June 2009, the business cycling dating group
of the National Bureau of Economic Research said today.
