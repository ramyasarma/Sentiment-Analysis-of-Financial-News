             Russia may stop minting 1 kopek and
5 kopek coins because they cost more to produce than the value
of their metal after prices rose,  Vedomosti  reported.  
 Bank Rossii, Russia’s central bank, has submitted proposals
to parliament, the newspaper said, citing a letter from the
bank.  
 Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, may review the
proposals in several weeks and will support them, Vedomosti
said, citing Pavel Medvedev, deputy chairman of the financial
committee at the Duma.
