             The Swedish krona rose against the
euro after Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  won a second term in
office in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.  
 The krona also gained against the dollar as Reinfeldt’s
coalition secured 172 seats in the 349-seat parliament with more
than 99 percent of ballots from Swedish districts counted, the
election authority said. The bloc of Social Democrats, Greens
and Left Party won 157 seats and the Swedish Democrats won 20
seats.  
 “With the Swedish election over, one more event risk for
the krona is gone,” said  John Hydeskov , an analyst at Danske
Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “The result shall not have much impact
on financial markets in Sweden.”  
 The krona rose 0.1 percent to 9.2216 per euro as of 9:36
a.m. in Stockholm after dropping to 9.2610 earlier, the weakest
since Sept. 9. Sweden’s krona gained 0.6 percent to 7.0274
against the U.S. dollar.  
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond rose 5
basis points to 2.65 percent. The krona will gain to 9 “within
months,” Hydeskov said.  
 “Minority governments are a familiar result in the Swedish
political system and the legislative procedure makes it easier
for minority governments to implement their fiscal policy course
than would be the case in other countries,”  Ulrich Leuchtmann ,
head of foreign-exchange strategy at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt, wrote in a note. “Markets are likely to remember
quite quickly how robust the Swedish political system is.”  
 Norway’s krone gained 0.1 percent to 7.9608 per euro before
a central bank meeting in two days time. Policymakers will
probably leave the benchmark rate at 2 percent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of all 14 economists.
