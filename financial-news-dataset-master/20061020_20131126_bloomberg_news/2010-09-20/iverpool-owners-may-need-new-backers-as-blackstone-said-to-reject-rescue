             Liverpool’s American owners may
need new backers after Blackstone Group LP’s GSO Capital
Partners LP rejected a refinancing plan for the 18-time English
soccer champion, two people familiar with the situation said.  
 Texan  Tom Hicks , who owns Liverpool with Colorado-based
 George Gillett , approached the unit to be the lead capital
provider of a group that would pay off the duo’s debt with  Royal
Bank of Scotland Plc  before it matures next month.  
 GSO has decided not to buy some of the debt, which has
grown to about 282 million pounds ($439 million) because of
penalties linked to Hicks and Gillett’s failure to sell, the
people said. They spoke anonymously because the negotiations are
private.  
 Bennett J. Goodman , a senior managing director at GSO,
didn’t immediately respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment.  
 Hicks was in London last week to meet with club board
members to discuss the future of the U.K.’s most successful
soccer team. Hicks and Gillett put the club up for sale in April
after RBS agreed to extend the debt repayment schedule.
