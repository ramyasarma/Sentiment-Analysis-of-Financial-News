             Cattle futures fell from a two-year
high after a government report showed U.S. feedlots stepped up
purchases of young animals. Hogs rose.  
 Feedlots bought 2.27 million head of cattle last month, up
7.1 percent from August 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said on Sept. 17 after markets closed in Chicago. Analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey expected a 0.1 percent decline. Feedlots
may have boosted buying after futures rose above $1 a pound,
improving prospects for profit, said  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc.  
 “The cattle-on-feed report is clearly a bit of a
negative” for prices today, Roose said from West Des Moines,
Iowa. Feedlots increased purchases because of “optimism coming
from some of the back-month cattle contracts,” he said. “Guys
wanted to take advantage of that, and they filled their feedlots
back up.”  
 Cattle futures for December delivery fell 1.35 cents, or
1.3 percent, to close at $1.006 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. On Sept. 17, the price reached $1.0265, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Sept. 26, 2008.
The commodity has gained 17 percent this year as beef demand
recovered from the recession.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement fell 1.4
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $1.1095 a pound. Earlier the price
touched $1.1075, the lowest level since June 21.  
 The total feedlot herd increased 2.8 percent to 10.173
million cattle, more than the 1.1 percent gain forecast by
analysts.  
 Hog Market  
 Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.825 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 76.775 cents a pound. The price earlier fell as much
as 0.3 percent. The commodity has climbed 17 percent this year.  
 Prices were supported because the USDA may report on Sept.
22 that U.S.  stockpiles  of frozen pork are shrinking, Roose
said. At the end of August, cold-storage supplies may have
tumbled 27 percent from a year earlier to 385.4 million pounds,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of two analysts.  
 U.S. supplies of  pork bellies  may have plunged 80 percent
to 9.9 million pounds, according to the survey. Pork bellies are
cured and sliced to make bacon.  
 “Pork in cold storage is very tight, so that’s the
positive thing here,” Roose said. Supplies are “at historical
lows,” he said.
