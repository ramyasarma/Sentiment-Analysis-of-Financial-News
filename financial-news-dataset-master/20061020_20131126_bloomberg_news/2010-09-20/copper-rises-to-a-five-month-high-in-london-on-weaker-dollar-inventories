             Copper may rise in New York as a
weaker dollar fuels demand for industrial metals as an
alternative investment and inventories shrink.  
 The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell as much as 0.4 percent, making
dollar-priced metals cheaper in terms of other monies.
Stockpiles of copper tracked by the London Metal Exchange slid
after declining for a 30th week in a row last week.  
 “Ample liquidity, a weaker dollar, a stronger yuan and
robust demand from China” are supporting prices of industrial
metals, said  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. He predicted “further upward moves.”  
 Copper for delivery in December gained 0.5 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $3.527 a pound at 7:57 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The most-active contract touched $3.5555, the highest
price since April 26. Copper for delivery in three months rose
0.4 percent to $7,750 a metric ton on the LME.  
 Cash copper’s discount to the three-month contract shrank
to $9 a ton on Sept. 17, the narrowest intraday level since
Sept. 14, 2009. The so-called contango was at $10.75 in the
prior session, according to the latest LME data.  
 Scarcity Concern  
 “With this move being led by spot prices pushing higher,
it certainly looks bullish,” said  Nic Brown , an analyst at
Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd. in London. The shift toward a so-
called backwardation, when cash copper trades at a premium to
the three-month contract, “reflects growing concerns about
scarcity of physical metal,” he said.  
 The dollar slid on speculation the Federal Reserve will say
tomorrow it’s considering further measures to keep borrowing
costs low. Policy makers are likely to affirm the central bank’s
pledge to keep interest rates low for an “extended period,”
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 A report today may signal that the housing market remains
poor in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest copper consumer
after China. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells
Fargo confidence index was probably at 14 this month, from 13 in
August, according to a Bloomberg News survey. The figures are
due at 10 a.m. in Washington.  
 Index readings below 50 indicate that most respondents said
conditions are poor. Construction accounts for a quarter of
copper demand, according to the Copper Development Association.  
 Smaller Inventories  
 Financial markets in China, the world’s largest metals
user, are closed from today to Sept. 24 for the Mid-Autumn
festival holiday.  
 LME copper stockpiles fell 0.4 percent to 382,500 tons,
daily exchange figures show. Orders to draw copper from
inventories, or canceled warrants, declined 2.8 percent to
28,950 tons. Two parties each held between 30 percent and 39
percent of the stockpiled metal as of Sept. 16.  
 Tin for three-month delivery on the LME was unchanged at
$23,600 a ton after touching $23,800, the highest intraday price
since July 16, 2008, in the prior session. The metal is this
year’s best LME performer, adding 39 percent, compared with the
26 percent advance by closest rival nickel.  
 Tin, which touched a record $25,500 a ton in May 2008, has
been bolstered by disruptions to production in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Indonesia. Shipments from Indonesia, the
largest exporter, may drop 19 percent this year to 80,000 tons,
said Alberth Tubogu, export director for mining and industry
products at the trade ministry.  
 Nickel, Aluminum  
 LME tin stockpiles rose 0.2 percent to 13,655 tons, paring
this year’s decline to 49 percent. Cash tin’s discount to the
three-month contract shrank to $9 a ton as of Sept. 17 from $36
a week earlier, according to LME data.  
 Nickel rose 0.8 percent to $23,375 a ton after reaching
$23,570, the highest intraday price since May 10, in the prior
session. Global stainless-steel output, accounting for two-
thirds of total demand, rose 44 percent to 15.65 million tons in
the year’s first half, the International Stainless Steel Forum
said on its website today.  
 Aluminum advanced 1.4 percent to $2,210 a ton. Canceled
warrants jumped 67 percent, the most since May 2007, to 251,825
tons, the highest level since July 22. They have more than
doubled in less than two weeks from this year’s low on Sept. 8.
LME inventories dropped for a third day to 4.39 million tons,
daily figures showed.  
 “While this may simply be a rent deal being put in place
by a trade player, it’s still something to keep an eye on,”
 Alex Heath , head of industrial-metals trading at Royal Bank of
Canada Europe Ltd. in London, said in a report. “It’s very easy
to see the light metal now testing resistance at $2,250 and then
targeting $2,500.”  
 Zinc added 1.4 percent to $2,182 a ton and lead climbed 0.5
percent to $2,213 a ton.
