             BAE Systems Plc , Europe’s largest
defense company, said it will buy  L-1 Identity Solutions Inc .’s
counter-terrorism business for about $296 million in cash.  
 The proposed acquisition of L-1 units SpecTal LLC, Advanced
Concepts Inc., and McClendon LLC will be funded out of cash
resources, the London-based company said in a statement today.  
 Safran SA, the French maker of engines for Airbus SAS and
Boeing Co., will buy other L-1 units, including the biometric
business that runs applications such as face- and iris-
recognition software, for about $1.6 billion, L-1 said in a
separate statement.  
 Safran’s purchase will close once BAE has bought the
intelligence-services unit, L-1 said. BAE’s purchase follows its
announcement to sell as much as $2 billion worth of U.S.
aircraft and vehicle controls on Sept. 13.
