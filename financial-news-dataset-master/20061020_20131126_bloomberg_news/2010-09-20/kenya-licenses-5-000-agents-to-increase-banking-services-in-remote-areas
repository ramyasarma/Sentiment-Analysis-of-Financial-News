             Kenya licensed almost 5,000 banking
agents to help bring financial services to areas of the country
where there aren’t any banking branches, central bank Governor
Njunguna Ndung’u said in Nairobi today.  
 Changes to Kenya’s banking law that took effect from Jan. 1
allow for so-called agent-banking, where commercial banks can
recruit agents to offer front-teller services including taking
deposits at locations such as supermarkets and petrol stations,
Ndung’u said on Jan. 14.
