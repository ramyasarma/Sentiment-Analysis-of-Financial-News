             Brit Insurance NV  rose the most
in almost eight weeks after Apollo Global Management and CVC
Capital Partners Ltd. made an 871 million-pound ($1.4 billion)
sweetened offer for the firm.  
 Brit  climbed  47.5 pence, or 4.8 percent, to 1,035 pence at
9:50 a.m. in London trading, the most since July 28. London-
based CVC and Apollo, founded by  Leon Black , bid 1,075 pence a
share in cash for the Lloyd’s of London insurer on Sept. 17 and
a further 25 pence depending on the value of the insurer’s
assets at the end of this year.  
 The difference between today’s share price and the offer
price is “pretty small given it’s only an indicative proposal
rather than a formal offer,” said  Joy Ferneyhough , a London-
based analyst at Execution Noble Ltd., whose “hold”
recommendation is under review. “There’s a small chance they
could find something in due diligence and we’re not through the
worst of the hurricane season yet.”  
 The latest offer for Brit, which sponsors the England
cricket team, is Apollo’s fourth. It’s 51 percent more than
Brit’s closing share price of 729 pence on June 10, the day
before Apollo’s first bid was announced. Brit’s board, led by
Chairman  John Barton , plans to recommend the offer to
shareholders and it has given the private equity firms an
Oct. 15 deadline to complete their bid.  
 A sale at 1,100 pence a share represents about 100 percent
of Brit’s book value, according to Ferneyhough. Lloyd’s of
London rivals including  Catlin Group Ltd.  and  Beazley Plc  are
trading at about 75 percent to 80 percent of their book value,
she said.  
 Brit’s claims from financial firms protecting themselves
against lawsuits have increased in the past year and the company
expects to pay out about $71 million following the Chilean
earthquake in February. It posted first-half net income of
67.4 million pounds, compared with a loss a year earlier.
