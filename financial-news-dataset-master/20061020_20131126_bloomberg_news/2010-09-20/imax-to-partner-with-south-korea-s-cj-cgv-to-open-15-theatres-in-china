             Imax Corp. , the developer of
technology for projecting movies onto giant screens, agreed to
open 15 cinemas in China in its biggest deal to expand in Asia.  
 Imax will partner with South Korea’s  CJ CGV Co. , which
operates five of its theater systems locally, the Mississauga,
Ontario-based company said today in a statement. The Asian
partner will install the first two theaters next year with the
remaining 13 scheduled to be completed between 2012 and 2015,
the company said, without identifying locations.  
 Today’s announcement brings to 96 the total number of  Imax 
systems scheduled for Greater China, the company’s second-
largest market, according to the statement. In July the company
signed agreements to install its technology in at least 10
additional locations in Russia as the growth of middle-class
populations in emerging markets boosts spending.  
 Imax rose 5.5 percent to close at $15.96 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading today. The shares have gained 20 percent this
year.  
 Imax in July agreed with Guangzhou Jinyi Film & Television
Group co. to open eight theaters in China, and signed a deal for
three cinemas with Kazakhstan’s Kinopark earlier this month. On
Sept. 17, Imax announced a joint venture with Rave Motion
Pictures for 13 theater installations in the U.S.  
 The Canadian company signed agreements to install its
technology in 168 theaters worldwide so far this year, compared
with 35 cinemas in 2009, according to the statement.
