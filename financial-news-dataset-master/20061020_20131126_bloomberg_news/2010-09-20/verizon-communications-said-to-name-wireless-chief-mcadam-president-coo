             Verizon Wireless chief  Lowell McAdam  is set to be named president and chief operating officer
at Verizon Communications Inc., putting him in line to succeed
Chief Executive Officer  Ivan Seidenberg , a source familiar with
the matter said.  
 An official announcement could come as early as tomorrow,
said the source, who couldn’t be named because the plans aren’t
completed.  John Killian , Verizon’s  chief financial officer  and
another potential successor to Seidenberg, said last week he
would retire to spend more time with his family.  
 McAdam, 56, and Killian had both been named as possible
successors to Seidenberg, who turns 65 in December 2011. McAdam
has run the most  profitable  part of Verizon for more than three
years, helping the second-largest U.S. phone company grow even
as it loses home phone customers.  
 Francis Shammo  will be named  chief financial officer ,
replacing Killian, said the source.  Daniel Mead , Verizon
Wireless’ operating chief, will become head of the mobile group,
the source said. The Wall Street Journal reported the move today.  
 Marquett Smith, a Verizon spokesman, did not immediately
return a call seeking comment after regular business hours.  
 Verizon is grappling with home-phone losses and job cuts
that have led business customers to curb spending. Sales may
shrink in 2010, for the first time in five years, by 1.2 percent
to $106.5 billion, based on the average of analysts’ estimates
in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Verizon Communications, which co-owns the wireless company
with Vodafone Group Plc., rose 26 cents to $31.68 in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading  on Sept. 17. The New York-based
company had risen 2.3 percent this year before today.
