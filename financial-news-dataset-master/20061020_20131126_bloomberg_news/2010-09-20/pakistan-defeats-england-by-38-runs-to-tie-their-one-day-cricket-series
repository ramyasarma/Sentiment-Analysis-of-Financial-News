             (Corrects headline to say series is tied.)  
 Pakistan defeated England by 38
runs at Lord’s in London to tie their one-day cricket series.  
 Pakistan got 64 runs from  Mohammad Hafeez , and  Abdul Razzaq 
scored 45 runs from 20 balls as the visitors got 50 runs in 29
balls for the 8th wicket. England had a good start, with  Andrew Strauss  and Steve Davies combining for 113 before the first
wicket fell. Six of the remaining England batsmen didn’t reach
10 runs.  
 The teams will meet for the final time in the series in two
days in Southampton.
