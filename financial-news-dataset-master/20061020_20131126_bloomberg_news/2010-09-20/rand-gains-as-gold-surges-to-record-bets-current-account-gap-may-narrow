             South Africa’s rand strengthened
for a second day as gold advanced to a record high and as
analysts speculated a report this week will show the nation’s
current-account deficit narrowed in the second quarter.  
 The rand appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 7.0819 per
dollar and traded 0.3 percent stronger at 7.1221 by 4:47 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.1407. Against the euro,
the rand gained 0.1 percent to 9.3133.  
 Gold rallied for a third straight day, gaining as much as
much as 0.5 percent to an all-time high of $1,283.38 an ounce,
as the dollar weakened against the euro, boosting commodity
prices based in the U.S. currency. Platinum rose as much as 0.8
percent to $1,633.25 an ounce.  
 “We’re seeing a general shift out of the dollar to
emerging market assets, especially those that are commodity-
backed like South Africa,” said  Ian Cruickshanks , head of
research at Nedbank Treasury in Johannesburg. “Precious metals
are having a very good run while the general global search for
yield is still intact.”  
 Gold and platinum are South Africa’s biggest export
earners, together accounting for about a fifth of the country’s
foreign revenue. The nation’s 6 percent benchmark  interest rate 
also makes the rand an attractive purchase for so-called carry
trades, in which investors borrow in countries with low rates to
invest in markets that offer higher returns.  
 Carry Trade  
 Near-zero interest rates in developed nations have
encouraged net purchases of 102.3 billion rand ($14.4 billion)
of South African stocks and bonds this year, according to the
 JSE Ltd. , which runs the country’s exchanges. South Africa
relies on the inflows to finance the deficit on its current
account, a measure of trade in goods and services.  
 A report this week is expected to show the  current-account 
shortfall narrowed to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product in
the second quarter, from 4.6 percent in the first three months
of the year, based on the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Our expectation of a narrowing in the current-account
deficit for second quarter 2010 is supportive of a stronger rand
bias in the short term,”  Standard Bank Group Ltd.  analysts led
by Johannesburg-based strategist  Michael Keenan  wrote in a
client note today.  
 Government bonds rose for the first time in three days,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
adding less than 1 cent to 125.20 rand. The yield on the bond
decreased less than 1 basis point to 7.36 percent.
