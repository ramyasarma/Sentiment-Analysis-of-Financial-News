             Service on New York’s Metro-North
railroad from Grand Central has been restored after a fire at
the 138th Street bridge over the Harlem River was contained.  
 Service has resumed with “scattered delays” of as long as
15 minutes, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said today
in an e-mailed statement.  
 “The fire is under control and two of four tracks on the
138th Street Bridge have been restored,” according to the e-
mail. “We continue to assess any damage on the remaining two
tracks and its impact, if any, on the PM peak service.”  
 Service on the Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines was
suspended after a fire under the bridge was reported at 11:45
a.m. today,  Marjorie Anders , a spokeswoman for the Metro-North
service, said today in a telephone interview.  
 The fire may have been started by the explosion of a
transformer adjacent to the track, Anders said. The blast set
fire to wooden pilings intended to protect against damage from
boat traffic, she said.  
 “When they said ‘fire,’ that was scary,” said Mary Ann
Magnano, a retired 63-year-old at Grand Central who was
traveling to the North White Plains station. “But everything is
clear now. No one seemed too panicked. It’s looking fine.
They’ve been keeping us updated.”  
 Transit officials don’t yet know whether the explosion
damaged the bridge’s metal structure, Anders said. Metro-North
serves about 135,000 commuters daily, she said.
