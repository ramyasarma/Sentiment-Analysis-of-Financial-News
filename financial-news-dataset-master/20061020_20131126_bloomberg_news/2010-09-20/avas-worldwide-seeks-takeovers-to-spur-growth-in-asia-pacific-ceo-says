             Havas SA , owner of the Euro RSCG
Worldwide advertising agency, is seeking Asia-Pacific takeovers
and expects revenue from the region to more than triple to as
much as 20 percent of the total in five years.  
 Havas is in the process of completing a medium-sized  deal ,
 David Jones , chief executive officer of Havas Worldwide and Euro
RSCG, said in an interview in Singapore today. The purchase will
be completed in the next few months, he said, declining to be
more specific.  
 “For us, Asia is a priority,” Jones said. “You are not
only seeing a huge number of new businesses spring up in Asia,
but you are actually seeing Asian companies take control of some
of the big global businesses.”  
 Revenue from Asia Pacific now accounts for about 5 percent
to 6 percent of the total, Jones said. The region will become
the largest advertising market soon after 2014 as the economic
slowdown in North America accelerated the shift of ad dollars to
digital media in China, India and Brazil, eMarketer Inc. and
Starcom MediaVest Group said in a report earlier this month.  
 Havas’s main focus areas for acquisitions are in the
healthcare business and digital media, which includes social
media and search companies, Jones said. The company also aims to
expand in Latin America, he said.  
 “We are looking at $10 million to $20 million businesses
around the world and that’s probably our sweet spot,” he said.
The company tends to aim for more than a 50 percent stake, he
said.  
 In the next couple of years, Havas aims to have revenues of
more than 10 percent from Asia Pacific, and increase that to 15
percent to 20 percent in five years, Jones said. Currently, the
company gets about 5 percent to six percent from the region.
