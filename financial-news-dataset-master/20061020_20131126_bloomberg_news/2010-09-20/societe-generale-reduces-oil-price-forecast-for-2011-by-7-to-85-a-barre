             Societe Generale SA  cut its oil
price forecast for next year to $85 a barrel from $92 as demand
growth slows and production outside OPEC expands.  
 Growth in worldwide crude consumption in 2011 will decrease
to 1.4 million barrels a day from 1.8 million a day this year,
as the pace of economic recovery slackens, France’s second-
largest bank by market value said in a report today.  
 “The macroeconomic data flow has been mixed to poor in
recent months, especially in the U.S.,”  Mike Wittner , the
bank’s London-based head of oil market research, said in the
report. “There are also concerns remaining about Europe and
China. Macro worries directly feed into doubts about the near-
term health of oil demand.”  
 Crude for October delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange traded around $74 a barrel today, having lost 7 percent
this year as slowing growth causes spare fuel inventories in the
U.S. to accumulate. Oil gained 78 percent last year.  
 Societe Generale predicted that prices will average $80 a
barrel in the fourth quarter, capped by “stubbornly high”
stockpiles in industrialized nations.  
 The bank raised its outlook for next year’s supplies from
outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries by
80,000 barrels a day to 220,000 barrels a day. Non-OPEC supply,
accounting for about 60 percent of the global total, will grow
by 840,000 barrels a day this year, according to Societe
Generale.
