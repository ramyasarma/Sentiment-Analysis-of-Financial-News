             MicroPort Scientific Corp. , which
makes equipment for keyhole surgery, raised about HK$1.54
billion ($198.3 million) selling shares at the top of its price
range in an initial public offering in Hong Kong, according to
two people with knowledge of the transaction.  
 The Shanghai-based producer of coronary stents sold 252.7
million shares at HK$6.10 apiece, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information was private. Terms for
the sale earlier showed that MicroPort had planned to sell
shares at HK$4.60 to HK$6.10.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG  and  Piper Jaffray Asia Securities 
managed the sale, according to the company’s IPO prospectus.
MicroPort plans to start trading on Sept. 24 under ticker number
853, the prospectus said. Adam Harper, a Hong Kong-based Credit
Suisse spokesman, declined to comment. Alex Ko, chief executive
officer of Piper Jaffray Asia Holdings Ltd., was not available
to comment.  
 Proceeds of the IPO will be used to develop new products,
acquire businesses and expand the company’s production
facilities, the prospectus said. The company has an option to
sell an additional 37.9 million shares after the listing, the
prospectus said.  
 MicroPort makes so-called interventional and minimally
invasive devices to treat vascular diseases. The company
supplies more than 1,100 hospitals across China, according to
its  website .  
 Chairman Chang Zhaohua, who founded the company in 1998,
said on Sept. 12 that MicroPort had overcome doubts about
medical devices made in China to acquire a 28.9 percent share of
the country’s market for heart stents.
