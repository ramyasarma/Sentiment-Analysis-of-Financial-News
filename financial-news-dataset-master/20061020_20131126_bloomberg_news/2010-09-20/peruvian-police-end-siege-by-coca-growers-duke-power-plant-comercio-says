             Peruvian police freed workers at a
power plant in the Amazon jungle besieged by coca growers
opposed to a government program to eradicate their crops,  El
Comercio  said.  
 The Termoselva plant, owned by a unit of  Duke Energy Corp .,
was seized yesterday by 120 coca growers who took workers
hostage and shut off electricity supply to Aguaytia and
Pucallpa, the biggest town in Peru’s central jungle, the Lima-
based newspaper reported.  
 Peru is the world’s largest producer of coca, the raw
material for cocaine, according to the United Nations Office on
Drugs & Crime.
