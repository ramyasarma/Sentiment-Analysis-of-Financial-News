             Ally Financial Inc.’s  GMAC Mortgage 
unit told brokers and agents to halt foreclosures on homeowners
in 23 states including Florida, Connecticut and New York.  
 GMAC Mortgage  may “need to take corrective action in
connection with some foreclosures” in the affected states,
according to a two-page memo dated Sept. 17 and obtained by
Bloomberg News. Ally Financial spokesman  James Olecki  confirmed
the contents of the memo. Brokers were told to stop evictions,
cash-for-key transactions and lockouts, regardless of occupant
type, with immediate effect, according to the document,
addressed to GMAC preferred agents.  
 The company will also suspend  sales  of properties on which
it has already foreclosed. The letter tells brokers to notify
buyers that the company will extend the closing date on all
sales by 30 days. Buyers will be able to cancel their agreement
to purchase and get their deposit back, according to the letter.  
 GMAC Mortgage ranked fourth among U.S. home-loan
originators in the first six months of this year, with $26
billion of mortgages, according to industry newsletter Inside
Mortgage Finance. Wells Fargo & Co. ranked first, with $160
billion, and Citigroup Inc. was fifth, with $25 billion.  
 GMAC was created in 1919 to provide financing for buyers of
General Motors Co.’s vehicles. GMAC converted into a bank
holding company in 2008 as it received more than $17 billion of
government funds during the financial crisis. It rebranded
itself Ally Financial last year, and continues to offer auto
loans and mortgages.
