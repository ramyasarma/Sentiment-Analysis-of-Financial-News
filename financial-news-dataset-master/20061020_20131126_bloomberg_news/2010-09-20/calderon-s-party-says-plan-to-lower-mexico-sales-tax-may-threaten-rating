             A top lawmaker from Mexican
President  Felipe Calderon ’s party said a proposal to lower the
sales tax would jeopardize the country’s credit rating.  
 Carlos Perez, the deputy coordinator for the  National
Action Party  in the lower house of Congress, said the proposal
by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the largest
party in the chamber, would send a negative signal to investors.  
 The PRI on Sept. 7 submitted a bill to lower the value-
added tax to 15 percent from 16 percent just a year after it was
increased to help boost government finances. The PRI’s proposal
would reduce public revenue by 33 billion pesos ($2.6 billion),
Perez said.  
 “It’s not the 33 billion pesos, but rather the message
that we would send at home and abroad,” Perez said in a
telephone interview. “Our rating wouldn’t be the same.”  
 Standard & Poor’s in December cut Mexico’s foreign-currency
debt rating to BBB, the second-lowest investment grade, from
BBB+, with a stable outlook, saying the government failed to
broaden the tax base significantly. Fitch Ratings downgraded the
country in November. Moody’s rates Mexico at Baa1, the third-
lowest investment grade rating.  
 Still, last year’s tax increases were key to restoring
confidence in Mexico’s finances this year and helped the country
avoid following others into a “world of sovereign stress,”
former Deputy Finance Minister  Alejandro Werner  said in
February.  
 2011 Budget  
 Mexico’s government proposed a 2011 budget without changes
to tax laws, and Calderon has said he opposes lowering sales
taxes. The lower house must approve the income portion of the
budget by Oct. 20.  
 Analysts were divided on whether the tax-cut measure would
pass the lower house. The PRI aims to do so because it would be
a popular move ahead of the election for governor of the State
of Mexico next year and the presidential race in 2012, said
 Jorge Chabat , a political science professor at the Center for
Economic Research and Teaching in Mexico City.  
 “There’s a real intention to lower the value-added tax to
15 percent” Chabat said. “It would be very popular in terms of
votes because they can say they’re defending people’s
pocketbooks.”  
 While the PRI has enough votes to pass the bill, there may
not be enough consensus within the party to do so, said Luis
Flores, an economist at Ixe Grupo Financiero SA, a Mexico City-
based firm with banking and brokerage operations. The party may
be trying to gain votes for the 2012 presidential elections by
voicing support for a tax cut without actually intending to pass
it, he said.  
 ‘Stay the Same’  
 “What they want is for everything to stay the same, but
showing everyone that they wanted to lower the tax,” Flores
said.  
 After the lower house approves the income portion of the
budget, the Senate must pass it, and Calderon can veto it. To
overturn a veto, both houses of congress would need to pass it
by a two-thirds majority.

p.m. New York time from 12.7994.
