             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts rose to a one-month high as economists raised
their forecasts for inflation, fueling speculation that the
central bank will resume raising borrowing costs next year.  
 The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 11.48 percent at 8:58 a.m. New York time. It touched 11.5
percent, the highest level since Aug. 13.  
 Inflation will end 2011 at 4.95 percent, up from a week
earlier forecast of 4.90 percent, according to the median
forecast in a Sept. 17 central bank survey of about 100
economists published today. Economists also raised their 2010
inflation forecast to 5.01 percent, from 4.97 percent a week
earlier.  
 The real gained 0.3 percent to 1.7169 per dollar, from
1.7213 on Sept. 17.
