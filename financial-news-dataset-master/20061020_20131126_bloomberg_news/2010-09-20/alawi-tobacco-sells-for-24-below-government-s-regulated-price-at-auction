             The average price of tobacco in
Malawi, the world’s largest producer of burley tobacco, dropped
24 percent below the government-set price of $2 per kilogram
(2.2 pounds) about a week before the close of sales.   
 The leaves sold at average $1.52 per kilogram in the week
through Sept. 17, from $1.67 recorded two weeks ago, Auction
Holdings Ltd., the Lilongwe-based manager of Malawi’s auction 
floors, said in a statement published in the Daily Times
newspaper today. During the week, 3.9 million kilograms of
tobacco worth $5.9 million were sold, it said.
