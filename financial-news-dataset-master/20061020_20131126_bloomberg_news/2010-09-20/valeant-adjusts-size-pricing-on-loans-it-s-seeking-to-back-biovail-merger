             Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International , the U.S. company merging with Canada’s  Biovail
Corp. , adjusted the size and pricing on loans it’s seeking to
help finance the transaction, according to a person familiar
with the talks.  
 The facility will include a $950 million to $1 billion term
loan A due 2015 and a term loan B and delayed-draw term loan B
totaling $625 million to $675 million, both due in 2016, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. Valeant also is seeking a $175 million revolving line
of credit that expires in 2015.  
 The interest rate on the term loan B will be 4 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.5
percent Libor floor, according to the person. The loan is
expected to price at 99 cents on the dollar.  
 Commitments on the facility for Aliso Viejo, California-
based Valeant are due today at 5 p.m. New York time, said the
person.  
 The facility initially included a $725 million term loan B,
a $150 million delayed-draw term loan B, a $250 million revolver
and a $750 million term loan A, according to a Sept. 9 Standard
& Poor’s report.  
 Initial price guidance on the term loan B portions of the
facility was 4.25 percentage points over Libor, with a 1.75
percent Libor floor. The loans were expected to price at 98.5
cents on the dollar.  
 In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t. A term loan A is
sold primarily to banks, while a term loan B is mainly sold to
investors such as mutual funds, hedge funds and institutions
that arrange collateralized loan obligations.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Jefferies
Group Inc. are arranging the debt, said the person.
