             Bank of America Corp.  is marketing
a collateralized loan obligation for Blackstone Group LP’s GSO
Capital Partners LP that will be at least $400 million,
according to people familiar with the terms.  
 The structure is expected to consist of four rated pieces
including a slice ranked AAA by Standard & Poor’s, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. The CLO also will include an equity piece, of which a
majority will be sold to third-party investors, one of the
people said.  
 CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  
 Heather Lucania , a spokeswoman for New York-based
Blackstone, and Danielle Robinson, a Bank of America
spokeswoman, declined to comment.
