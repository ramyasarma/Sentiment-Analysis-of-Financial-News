             Israel’s 10-year bonds rose for the
first time in three days as yields at the highest level in more
than six weeks lured investors. The shekel weakened, snapping an
eight-day advance, as the central bank bought dollars.  
 The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January 2020 gained
0.12 shekel to 107.2 at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, pushing
the yield on the 5 percent bond down 2 basis points to 4.46
percent. The yield climbed to 4.48 percent at yesterday’s close,
the highest since Aug. 4.  
 “The liquidity rate is high among institutional investors
and they are looking for attractive investment alternatives,”
 Ayelet Nir , chief economist at Tel Aviv-based IBI, said by
telephone. When yields reach the 4.5 percent level, “the risk
reward is in favor of buying,” Nir said.  
 The shekel lost as much as 0.3 percent to 3.7298 per dollar
from 3.7193 on Sept. 17, the highest close in five months. It
was little changed at 3.7202 to the dollar at 5:09 p.m. in Tel
Aviv.  
 “The central bank bought tens of millions of dollars today
and showed its presence in the foreign currency market,” said
 Eyal Cohen , trading room manager at Mercantile Discount Bank
Ltd. in Tel Aviv. The Bank of Israel declined to comment.  
 The bank has been buying foreign currencies since March
2008 in an attempt to stave off shekel gains, which erode the
local-currency value of the nation’s exports. It has more than
doubled  reserves  to $64.1 billion.
