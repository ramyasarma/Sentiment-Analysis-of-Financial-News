             Lloyds Banking Group Plc  Chief
Executive Officer  Eric Daniels  could step down within five
months, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people
involved with finding a successor to Daniels.  
 One of the people said a new chief may be in place by the
time the bank releases its annual results in February, the FT
said. Daniels will leave the company without a payoff, the
newspaper said. He is contractually entitled to as much as 7.77
million shares, currently worth 6 million pounds ($9.3 million),
the FT said.
