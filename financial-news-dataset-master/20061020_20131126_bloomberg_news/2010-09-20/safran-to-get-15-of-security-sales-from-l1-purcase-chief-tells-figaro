             Safran SA expects its purchase of
three businesses of U.S. company L1 to bring in about 15 percent
of its sales from security operations, Le Figaro said, citing
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Herteman.  
 Safran is buying the L1 operations for about 1 billion
euros in enterprise value, the executive told the newapaper.
Safran is buying three operations -- biometry, identity
documents and enrolement -- and a third of L1’s fourth business.  
 The three L1 operations Safran is purchasing have annual
sales of $500 million with “double-digit” growth, the
executive was reported as saying.
