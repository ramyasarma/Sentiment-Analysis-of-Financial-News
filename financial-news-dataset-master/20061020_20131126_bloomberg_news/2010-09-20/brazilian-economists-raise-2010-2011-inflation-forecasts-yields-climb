             Economists see rising inflation
risks in Brazil’s economy on the back of rising  commodities
prices , cementing expectations policy makers will resume
interest rate increases next year.  
 Inflation will end 2011 at 4.95 percent, up from a week
earlier forecast of 4.90 percent, according to the median
forecast in a Sept. 17 central bank survey of about 100
economists published today.  
 “Domestic demand is very hot, and we have pressure from
commodities prices, such as cattle and soy,” said  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Sao Paulo-based Gradual
Investimentos, which has 2.5 billion reais ($1.45 billion) in
assets under management.  
 Economists also raised their 2010 inflation forecast to
5.01 percent, from 4.97 percent a week earlier. Consumer prices
will rise 5.12 percent over the next 12 months, from a week
earlier forecast of 5.06 percent, the survey found. The central
bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  
 The real gained 0.4 percent to 1.7144 per dollar at 8:20
a.m. New York time, from 1.7213 on Sept. 17. In the overnight
interest-rate futures market, the yield on the contract due in
January 2012 increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 11.49 percent.  
 The central bank on Sept. 1 kept interest rates unchanged
at 10.75 percent, after raising the Selic a total of 2
percentage points at their previous three meetings to prevent
the economy from overheating. Analysts forecast policy makers
will resume rate increases in March, and will lift the benchmark
Selic rate to 11.75 percent by June.  
 “When the bank decided to hold rates at 10.75 percent, it
opened room for more inflation in 2011,” Perfeito said.  
 Economists raised their 2010 growth forecast to 7.47
percent, from 7.42 percent a week earlier.
