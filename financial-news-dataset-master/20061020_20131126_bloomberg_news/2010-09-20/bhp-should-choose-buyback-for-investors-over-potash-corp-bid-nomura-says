             BHP Billiton Ltd. , bidding $40
billion for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., would provide 11-
times greater returns for its holders in 2011 by choosing a
share buyback over the offer, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 “BHP would be foregoing potentially significant earnings
per share accretion from share buybacks for the same level of
re-gearing,” Nomura analysts led by London-based  Paul Cliff 
wrote in a report today. The current bid of $130 a share would
add 2 percent to EPS in 2011, while a buyback of equal value
would add 22 percent, Nomura estimated.  
 Potash Corp. rejected the offer from BHP, the world’s
biggest mining company, and began talks with third parties.  BHP 
should spend money on its own mines, on buybacks or dividends
ahead of acquisitions, according to 64 percent of respondents to
a Bloomberg News survey of investors this month.  
 “BHP would need to execute a share buyback scheme of only
roughly $6 billion to achieve the same EPS accretion as the
proposed acquisition,” Nomura wrote. Melbourne-based BHP may
have to raise its offer to complete the deal, Nomura said.  
 Potash Corp. advanced 1.8 percent to $149.95 by 12:19 p.m.
in New York. That values the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based
company at $44.5 billion, Bloomberg data show.  BHP  fell 0.3
percent to A$38.78 in Sydney trading today. It rose 2.1 percent
to 1,980 pence at the 4:35 p.m. close of London trading.  
 “The Potash bid looks unexciting on near-term financials
at current levels and poor beyond $150-160 a share,” HSBC
Holdings Plc analysts led by London-based  Andrew Keen  wrote in a
Sept. 17 report. “It is also far less exciting (for investors,
not management) than returning capital. The merits are likely to
swing on a medium-term outlook for potash.”
