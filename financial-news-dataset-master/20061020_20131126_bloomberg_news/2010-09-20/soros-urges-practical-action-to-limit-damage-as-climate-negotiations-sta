             Billionaire investor  George Soros 
said debate about tackling global warming is being overtaken by
damage occurring from climate change and practical action is
needed.  
 “The gap between what needs to be done and what’s actually
happening is getting wider,” Soros, founder of Soros Fund
Management LLC that oversees about $25 billion in assets, said
today at a New York panel discussion on climate change.  
 Soros, 80, has said he will invest $1 billion in clean-
energy technology and donate $100 million to an environmental
policy group to aid new regulations. Soros said he was motivated
after observing international climate-treaty negotiations
deadlock last year in Copenhagen.  
 The talks didn’t accomplish anything “except to keep the
negotiations open,” Soros said. The meetings for a new global
treaty to reduce greenhouse-gas pollution take place “far
removed from reality,” he said.  
 Soros said he is working to slow deforestation and remove
carbon dioxide, a main greenhouse gas, from coal. Soros spoke at
an opening ceremony of Climate Week, a series of events focused
on global warming. Sponsors include Zurich-based Swiss
Reinsurance Co., the world’s second-biggest reinsurer.
