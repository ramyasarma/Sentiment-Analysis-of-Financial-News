             Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. , Pakistan’s
biggest oil processor, resumed production from its plant in
Multan after the nation’s deadliest floods receded, Saba Ahmed,
a spokeswoman for the company, said by telephone from Karachi.  
 The plant, which processes a third of the country’s crude,
was shut down six weeks ago because fuel tankers couldn’t pass
flooded roads. The 100,000 barrel-a-day refinery lies about 900
kilometers (560 miles) northeast of the port city of Karachi.  
 Floods in Pakistan have affected 20 million people, killing
more than 1,700, and have damaged 1.9 million homes, according
to the United Nations which asked on Sept. 17 for $2 billion in
aid, the largest appeal for humanitarian relief ever made by the
world body.  
 The refinery sells oil products such as gasoline, diesel
and jet fuel in the local market through intermediaries
including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., Total SA and
 Pakistan State Oil Co . It is jointly owned by the governments of
Pakistan and Abu Dhabi.
