             Corn rose to the highest level in
almost two years on concern U.S. production may slide because of
lower yields and as drought in Russia delays planting of the
winter-grains crop. Soybeans climbed to a 15-month peak.  
 December-delivery corn gained as much as 2.1 percent to
$5.2375 a bushel, the highest price since Sept. 30, 2008, and
was at $5.22 on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris
time. Soybeans advanced as much as 2.9 percent to the highest
price since June 12, 2009. In China, corn touched a record and
soybeans were the costliest since January.  
 Corn may reach $5.75 a bushel as output drops in the U.S.,
the world’s largest grower and exporter, Macquarie Group Ltd.
forecast in a report Sept. 17. Russian farmers have sown 39
percent less land with winter grains compared with a year
earlier because of dry weather, Interfax reported the same day.  
 “We have got concerns emanating out of the U.S. that their
U.S. corn-production numbers may not match expectations,” said
 Luke Mathews , commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. Corn futures have surged about 40 percent so far this
quarter, set for the biggest three-month gain since 2006.  
 U.S. farmers will harvest 12.936 billion bushels this year,
down from a record 13.11 billion last year and less than the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s forecast of 13.16 billion,
after hot weather in August, Macquarie’s  Alexander Bos  said.
Yields will fall on average to 159.7 bushels an acre from 164.7
bushels last year, he said.  
 Lower Yields  
 U.S. corn yields will fall to 162.5 bushels an acre, down
from 164.1 bushels forecast on Aug. 20, Professional Farmers of
America said Sept. 17. The revised forecast is in line with the
outlook from the USDA.  
 There is “growing speculation of a decline of the U.S.
corn harvest potential,” Paris-based farm adviser  Agritel  said
on its website today.  
 Twenty-four out of 30 traders and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News on Sept. 17 said corn prices would climb this
week, while 24 of 31 predicted a gain in soybeans. Since 2004,
the surveys have been correct on corn 50 percent of the time.  
 Russia has banned grain exports until after the next
harvest because of drought, tightening global supplies of wheat
and boosting demand for corn as a substitute. Martell Crop
Projections, a forecaster, said on Sept. 16 the outlook for
Russia’s winter-wheat planting is “doom and gloom” as southern
wheat-growing regions remain too dry for sowing.  
 Weather in China  
 Northeastern parts of China’s Inner Mongolia region may
experience frost in the next three days, which will affect the
autumn crop harvest and output, Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday, citing the local weather bureau. China is the world’s
largest soybean buyer.  
 “China’s weather is extremely important, particularly with
respect to the soybean market,” Commonwealth Bank’s Mathews
said. “Any potential crop downgrades, whether that be actual
quantity or a quality issue, raises the prospects that their
imports may become a little bit larger than the market was
expecting.”  
 Corn for May delivery in Dalian climbed as much as 2.5
percent to 2,122 yuan ($316) a metric ton and closed at 2,119
yuan. Soybeans advanced as much as 3.8 percent to 4,190 yuan
before closing at 4,146 yuan.  
 Wheat for December delivery advanced to a five-week high of
$7.57 a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $7.485 a bushel.
The most-active contract has gained about 56 percent this
quarter, set for the best performance since the three months
through September 2007.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery rose 1.2 percent to
236.50 euros ($309.79) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  
 A freeze last week damaged wheat, canola and barley crops
in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan,  Drew Lerner , the president of World Weather Inc. in Overland Park,
Kansas, said Sept. 17.  
 Soybeans for November delivery added 2.1 percent to
$10.9125 a bushel in Chicago after touching $10.995.
