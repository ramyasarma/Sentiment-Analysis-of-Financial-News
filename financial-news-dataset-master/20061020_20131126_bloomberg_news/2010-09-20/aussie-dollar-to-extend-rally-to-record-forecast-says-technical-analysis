             The Australian dollar may extend
its rally toward the record high of 98.50 U.S. cents set in July
2008 should it strengthen beyond resistance at 95 cents and
96.50 cents, Forecast Pte said, citing trading patterns.  
 The 95 cents level is “psychological” and the 96.50 cents
area represents highs on May 21 and 22, June 9, and July 2, said
 Pak Lai Ng , a technical analyst at the Singapore-based company.
Daily momentum indicators such as the moving average
convergence/divergence, or MACD, also show the Australian
currency is poised for further gains, he said. Resistance refers
to an area where sell orders may be clustered.  
 “The Aussie looks to be very firm,” Ng said in an
interview. “There are no signs of a turndown yet, and there’s
a channel from the June low.”  
 Australia’s dollar traded at 94.56 U.S. cents as of 8:28
a.m. in Sydney from 94.72 cents in New York. It touched 94.94
cents yesterday, the strongest since July 2008 when the currency
reached 98.50 cents, a record high since the it began trading
freely in 1983. The currency has advanced 6.2 percent this
month, the best performer against the greenback among its 16
major counterparts.  
 The so-called Aussie is in an ascending channel formed by
an upper trend line that connects the highs of June 18, June 22
and August 6, and a lower trend line that connects the June 8
and July 6 lows, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An
ascending channel signals the currency will keep rising as long
as it doesn’t break below the lower trend line.  
 The Australian currency’s MACD was 0.0125 today, above the
signal line of 0.0100, based on Bloomberg data.  
 The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day
exponential moving average from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA
of the MACD, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the
MACD, and provides buy and sell signals.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.

                          Sept. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist in Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp., talks about the outlook for the Australian dollar, and how its valuation could affect interest-rate policy.
     Australia’s dollar rose toward a two-year high after central bank Governor Glenn Stevens signaled policy makers may need to resume raising interest rates should a mining boom stoke the economy next year and boost inflation. Callow speaks to Judith Bogner on Bloomberg Television's "Global Connection." (Source: Bloomberg)
