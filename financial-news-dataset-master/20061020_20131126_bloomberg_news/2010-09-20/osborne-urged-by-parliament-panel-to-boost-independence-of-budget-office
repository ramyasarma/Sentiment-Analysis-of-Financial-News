             Legislators urged Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  to enshrine in the law the independence
of Britain’s fiscal watchdog so that it can hold the government
to account and operate without political interference.  
 The Office for Budget Responsibility should be given powers
to hire its own staff and be free to speak out if Treasury
officials interfere with its work, Parliament’s cross-party
Treasury Committee said in a report published today. The panel
reiterated the need for lawmakers to have the right to veto
appointments and dismissals by the chancellor.  
 “For the OBR to succeed, it will have to be, and be seen
to be, independent,”  Andrew Tyrie , the Conservative Party
lawmaker who chairs the committee, said in the report.  
 The cross-party group of legislators last week approved
 Robert Chote , director of a research group that criticized
Osborne’s first budget as “regressive,” to head the fiscal
watchdog. The rules should also allow future governments to
produce their own forecasts if the OBR’s reputation is
tarnished, the Treasury Committee said.  
 Chote’s predecessor at the OBR,  Alan Budd , came under fire
from lawmakers concerned that the office was the subject of
ministerial interference. Osborne said he expects legislation
setting out the budget watchdog’s powers will go through
Parliament before the end of the year.
