             Clorox Co. , the maker of household-
cleaning products, is near an agreement to sell its STP and
Armor All auto-care brands to private-equity firm  Avista Capital
Partners  for $750 million to $800 million, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  
 The sale may be announced in the coming days, said these
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. Blackstone Group LP, Golden Gate Capital and Castle
Harlan Inc. were among firms that looked at the assets, which
have been on the block since April, one of the people said.  
 Clorox Chief Executive Officer  Don Knauss  said in May the
bleach maker would explore options for the auto-care brands
because the businesses have languished for years and aren’t a
good match. Proceeds from a sale could be used to help bolster
household and professional-cleaning businesses in Latin America
and Asia, areas where Clorox has said it wants to expand.  
 “It’s not the best fit in terms of the rest of their
portfolio,”  Jack Russo , an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in St.
Louis, said today in a telephone interview. Armor All and STP
“are leading brands in their categories, certainly more
cyclical brands than what Clorox is used to.”  
 Avista, made up of the former DLJ Merchant Banking
Partners, invests primarily in health care, energy and media
companies. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has been handling the sale for
Oakland, California-based Clorox.

 Dan Staublin , a spokesman for Clorox, declined to comment
on speculation and said the company will make an announcement if
and when it reaches an agreement on the auto-care business. A
JPMorgan spokeswoman also declined to comment, as did Avista.  
 Edward Jones’s Russo advises investors to hold Clorox
shares. They rose 96 cents to $67.61 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 11 percent
this year.  
 STP and Armor All have annual  sales  of about $300 million
and  earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of about $95 million, the people said. Potential
buyers viewed STP, a maker of oil treatments, brake fluid and
fuel-system cleaners, as more valuable than Armor All, which
makes automotive polishes and cleaners, the people said.  
 The deal is not finalized and may be delayed or fall
through in the final stages, said these people.  
 Some of the private-equity firms considered buying STP and
Armor All to merge them with other car-care brands also for
sale, said one of these people.  
 Pennzoil-Quaker State Co. , a unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
is shopping around brands including Rain-X wiper blades, Fix-a-
Flat tire inflator and Gumout, a gas-tank cleaner. Pennzoil-
Quaker announced it was exploring options for those brands in
May.
