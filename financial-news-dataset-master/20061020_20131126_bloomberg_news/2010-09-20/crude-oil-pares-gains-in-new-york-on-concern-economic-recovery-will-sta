             Crude oil increased for the first
time in five days as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced to
the highest level since May, signaling that the U.S. economic
recovery will accelerate.  
 Oil climbed 1.6 percent and stocks gained after Lennar
Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. homebuilder, beat profit
estimates and International Business Machines Corp. announced a
deal to acquire Netezza Corp. The longest U.S. recession since
the Great Depression ended in June 2009, lasting 18 months, the
National Bureau of Economic Research said.  
 “Oil is rising because of the strength of the stock
market,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. “The oil market
is looking at stocks as the best proxy for economic growth.”  
 Crude oil for October delivery advanced $1.20 to settle at
$74.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
gain since Sept. 10. The October contract expires tomorrow. The
more active November futures rose $1.27, or 1.7 percent, to end
the session at $76.19.  
 Brent crude oil for November settlement rose $1.11, or 1.4
percent, to end the session at $79.32 on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  
 The S&P 500 Index gained 1.5 percent to 1,142.71, and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4 percent to 10,753.62.  
 “Oil is tracking the S&P,” said  Tim Evans , an analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “The stock market has
become the best day-by-day, hour-by-hour, barometer for future
economic growth.”  
 Trailing the Depression  
 The economic decline trailed the 43-month Great Depression
from 1929 to 1933 and surpassed the 16-month recessions of 1973-
75 and 1981-82, according to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
bureau’s business cycle dating group. The committee is the
accepted arbiter of when recessions start and end.  
 The previous contractions in the post-World War II era
lasted 10 months on average.  
 “This statement just shows the moment when things stopped
getting worse,” Evans said. “It doesn’t mean we’re in the
midst of a strong V-shaped recovery and that investors should be
elated about the prospects of growth.”  
 Futures in New York dropped 3.7 percent last week, the
biggest decline since Aug. 13, after Enbridge Energy Partners LP
restarted a U.S. pipeline that sends Canadian oil to refineries
in the Midwest.  
 Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast that U.S. crude-oil
inventories declined 1.6 million barrels last week from 357.4
million a week earlier, according to the median of 14 estimates.
The Energy Department will report on Sept. 22. The decrease
would leave stockpiles at the lowest level since Aug. 13.  
 U.S. Supplies  
 “Most analysts anticipate that reports will show that
inventories fell last week because of the Enbridge pipeline
shutdown,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago. “Supplies are more than ample, so the
inventory drop won’t rattle the market much.”  
 Crude-oil stockpiles in the week ended Sept. 10 were 13
percent higher than the five-year average for the period, the
department said on Sept. 15.  
 “Oil has been gyrating around $75,” said  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut. “This should be a choppy, sideways market for the
next four or five weeks, unless we get signs the economy is
picking up, or the uncertainty and depressed conditions both
here and in Western Europe spread.”  
 Hurricane Season  
 Oil may fall now that the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season
has passed its peak, said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker with
Bache Commodities Ltd. in London. No major storms have affected
Gulf of Mexico production platforms. The season ends Nov. 30.  
 “Fundamentally, the end of the hurricane season approaches
and the economic data is far from rosy,” Bellew said. “Last
week’s losses have given technical analysts grounds to think oil
may retrace to $71 to $73.”  
 Societe Generale SA cut its oil price forecast for next
year to $85 a barrel from $92 as demand growth slows and output
outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
expands. Growth in worldwide crude consumption in 2011 will
decrease to 1.4 million barrels a day from 1.8 million a day
this year, as the pace of economic recovery slackens, France’s
second-largest bank by market value said in a report today.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 568,346 contracts as of 3:18
p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 694,425 contracts Sept. 17, 9.7
percent above the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.36 million contracts, the most since June 1.
