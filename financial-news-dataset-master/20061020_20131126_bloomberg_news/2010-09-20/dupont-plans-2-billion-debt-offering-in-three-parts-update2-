             DuPont Co. , the third-biggest U.S.
chemical maker, plans to sell $2 billion of notes in a three-
part offering as soon as today, according to a person familiar
with the transaction.  
 The company may issue $500 million of notes due in January
2016 that yield 72 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1 billion of notes maturing in 2021 that pay a
spread of 93 basis points and $500 million of bonds due in 2041
at 112.5 basis points, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  
 DuPont may supplement proceeds from the sale with cash on
hand and additional short-term debt to redeem its 5 percent
notes due in January 2013 and 5.875 percent debt maturing a year
later, the person said. The company has $1.75 billion
outstanding under those two offerings, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg .  
 Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse
Group AG are managing the sale, the person said. Moody’s
Investors Service assigns DuPont a rank of A2 and Standard &
Poor’s grades it an equivalent A.  
 DuPont, based in Wilmington, Delaware, last sold debt in
November, issuing $1 billion each of notes due in 2015 that
yielded 92 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries
and debt maturing in 2020 that paid a 117 basis-point spread,
Bloomberg data show.  
 The notes due in 2020 traded at 110.1 cents on the dollar
to yield 3.36 percent on Sept. 13, according to Trace, the bond
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The debt maturing in 2015 traded at 106.57 to yield
1.67 percent on Sept. 17, Trace data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 Dow Chemical Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp. are the two largest
U.S. chemical makers by sales.
