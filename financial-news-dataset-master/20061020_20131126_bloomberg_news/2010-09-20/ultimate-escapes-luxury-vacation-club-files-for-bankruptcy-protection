             Ultimate Escapes Inc. , a
destination-travel club that sells holidays in villas and yachts
from Tuscany to Costa Rica, filed for bankruptcy protection
after the financial crisis hindered fundraising and slowed
membership growth.  
 The company listed  assets  of $10 million to $50 million and
debt of $100 million and $500 million in Chapter 11 documents
filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.
Eighty-four affiliates also sought protection.  
 In an interview last week, Chief Executive Officer  Jim Tousignant  blamed the 2008 financial crisis for the Kissimmee,
Florida-based company’s fiscal woes. Ultimate Escapes raised
$15 million from members in January 2009, then fell about
$20 million short of its next fundraising attempt, in October,
collecting just $10 million from  investors . In February, it
scrapped another public offering.  
 The destination-travel  industry  has been hit with a series
of bankruptcies. Island One Inc. and five affiliates of the
resort company filed for bankruptcy protection in Florida this
month citing falling sales and declining property values.  
 High Country Club LLC, based in Denver, filed for Chapter 7
liquidation in January 2009. The parent company of the
Minneapolis-based Lusso Collection filed a Chapter 11 petition
in December 2008.  
 The case is In re Ultimate Escapes Holdings LLC, 10-12915,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
