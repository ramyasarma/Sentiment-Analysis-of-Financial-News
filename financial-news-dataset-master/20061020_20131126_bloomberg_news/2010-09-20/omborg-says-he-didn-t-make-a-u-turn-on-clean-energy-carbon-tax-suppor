             Bjoern Lomborg , the Danish social
scientist known for his opposition to efforts to cut emissions,
said taxing carbon dioxide and raising investments in renewable
energy are the best ways to limit global warming.  
 The author of the best-seller, “The Skeptical
Environmentalist,” in a new book advocated global spending on
developing renewable-energy technologies of about $100 billion a
year and new carbon taxes instead of cap-and-trade programs.  
 “We should be focusing on investing dramatically more in
research and development in green-energy technology,” Lomborg,
a professor who runs the  Copenhagen Consensus Center , said in an
interview in the Danish capital. “I’ve always said global
warming is real, that it’s man-made and that it’s an important
problem. But the current approach is just not working.”  
 His think tank, which advises on how to spend aid and
development money, said in 2008 that fighting malnutrition and
lowering trade barriers should be favored over reducing carbon
emissions. While the renewable energy spending he calls for is
four times greater than what he had earlier recommended, he said
his position on global warming is essentially unchanged.  
 His new book “ Smart Solutions to Climate Change ,”
published by Cambridge University Press, studies the costs and
benefits of various options dealing with climate change.
Lomborg, who edited the book and wrote the introduction and
conclusion, has in the past garnered attention for challenging
United Nations-led efforts to curb carbon emissions that are
blamed for global warming.  
 ‘Zero Probability’  
 Fighting climate change through policies such as the
European Union’s goal to reduce carbon emissions to 20 percent
below 1990 levels by 2020 would only avoid “a couple of cents
of climate change for every dollar spent,” he said. Every
dollar spent on research and development of renewable energy
“will avoid $11 of climate change,” he said.  
 “Do we want to go down a path we know has virtually zero
probability of working, or do we want a path that at least in 20
to 40 years can actually dramatically reduce carbon emissions?”
Lomborg said. “ Al Gore  says the world is going to come to an
end, but I’m not going to embrace any other policy solution
except the one we know doesn’t work.”  
 The $100 billion for renewable research should be financed
by a global carbon tax of $7 per metric ton of CO2 that should
replace cap-and-trade systems such as the European Trading
System, Lomborg said. “This is a theoretically beautiful point,
but of course it’s not going to happen in real life.”
