             Fremont General Corp., the third-largest provider of subprime U.S. mortgages through brokers and
lenders, postponed filing earnings for the fourth quarter and
for the year 2006. The stock fell to a three-year low.  
 Fremont General also will delay its earnings conference
call, the  Santa Monica , California-based company said in a
statement distributed today by PR Newswire. The statement didn't
give a reason for the delay, and a call to the company's
investor relations line wasn't immediately returned.  
 The company said it plans to file an explanation of the
delay with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 A slumping housing market and lending that allowed buyers
to borrow a down payment or provide little proof of their
ability to pay are contributing to the most problems for new
subprime loans in at least six years. New Century Financial
Corp. and HSBC Holdings Plc, the world's third-largest bank,
earlier this month said losses from their subprime mortgages are
rising faster than they anticipated.  
 Fremont General shares fell 84 cents, or 6.7 percent, to
$11.65 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading and
plummeted an additional $2.10, or 18 percent, to $9.55 as of
7:36 p.m. New York time in after-hours trading. It was the first
time the stock has traded at less than $10 since 2003. Including
the after-hours decline, the stock has fallen 60 percent in the
past year.
