             Maanshan Iron & Steel Co., (600808)  China's
fourth-largest listed steelmaker, will cut production by 15
percent this month because of weak demand and falling prices, a
company executive said.  
 The company will shut a hot-rolling  production line , an H-
beam line and a plant making reinforcement bars, Hu Shunliang, a
company spokesman, said today in a telephone interview from
Maanshan, Anhui province.  
 Maanshan joins Hebei Iron & Steel Group,  Shougang Corp. (000959)  and
other Chinese steelmakers in cutting output as the credit crunch
and economic slowdown curbs demand from builders and carmakers,
sending domestic prices tumbling. Maanshan's profit climbed 56
percent to 786.7 million yuan ($115 million) in the three months
ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier, the company said yesterday.  
 ``We expect Maanshan to barely break even in the fourth
quarter,'' Zhang Feng, a Hong Kong-based analyst with JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said in a note today. ``Although steelmakers can cut
production and adjust product mix, the business environment will
remain very challenging in the next one to two quarters.''  
 Maanshan Steel (323)  fell as much as 5.1 percent to HK$1.87 in
Hong Kong, trading at HK$1.90 at 11:48 a.m. local time, compared
with a 2.1 percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   
 China's spot prices have fallen by 37 percent from the June
peak to 3,720 yuan a metric ton, causing losses among almost all
steelmakers, Zhang said.  
 Maanshan hasn't decided how long the production cut will
last, Hu said. The company made 14.17 million tons of crude
steel last year.
