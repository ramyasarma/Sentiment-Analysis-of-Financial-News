             Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB (FMX) ,
Latin America's largest beverage company, said first-quarter
profit rose 13 percent, bolstered by beer and soft-drink sales
in  Mexico  and the expansion of the Oxxo convenience-store
chain.  
 Net income advanced to 1.29 billion pesos ($124 million),
or 36 centavos a local share, from 1.14 billion pesos a year
earlier, the Monterrey, Mexico-based brewer of Dos Equis and
Tecate beer said today in a  statement . Sales rose 8.4 percent
to 36.2 billion pesos.  
 Purchases of beer, soft drinks and convenience-store items
continue to advance in Mexico, where February retail sales
jumped 6.1 percent, the fastest pace in almost three years.  
 ``Our strong performance for the first quarter was driven
by double-digit growth in all our business units,'' Chief
Financial Officer Javier Astaburuaga said on a conference call
with analysts.  
 Credit Suisse Group analyst Tufic Salem estimated Femsa, as
the company is known, would report net income of 1.22 billion
pesos on sales of 35.9 billion pesos.  
 Femsa's American depositary receipts advanced 32 cents to
$44.27 at 4:03 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock has gained 16 percent this year.  
 Coca-Cola Femsa  
 Femsa's soft-drink unit, Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, said April
25 that first-quarter sales rose 6.4 percent to 17.3 billion
pesos, driven by demand for Coca-Cola in Mexico. The unit, the
largest Coca-Cola bottler in  Latin America , boosted net income
32 percent to 1.62 billion pesos.  
 ``Mexico remains our most profitable market, delivering
sustainable cash-flow generation despite the U.S. economic
slowdown,'' Coca-Cola Femsa Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said on a conference call with analysts on April 25.  
 Sales at Oxxo, Femsa's retail unit, rose 16 percent to
10.7 billion pesos. Operating income advanced 39 percent to 371
million pesos. Femsa has increased the number of stores since
the end of December by 73 to 5,636 in Mexico.  
 Femsa's convenience-store chain has expanded, with sales
tripling over five years to $3.87 billion in 2007, making it
Femsa's second-largest unit. The company plans to open stores
in  Colombia  by the end of this year, Femsa Chief Executive
Officer Jose Antonio Fernandez said in an April 15 interview.  
 Beer Sales  
 Beer sales rose 6.8 percent to 9.11 billion pesos as sales
by volume in Mexico advanced 7.1 percent to 6.06 million
hectoliters (160 million gallons) and average prices advanced
1.2 percent. In Brazil, beer sales volume increased 2.9 percent
to 2.41 million hectoliters and average prices fell 3 percent.  
 The beer unit's operating profit increased 36 percent to
673 million pesos as higher sales volume and a stronger
Brazilian currency helped check higher barley and aluminum
prices. The cost of sales rose 6.4 percent, Femsa said.  
 Prices of grains such as barley will rise as much as 6
percentage points more than the company's earlier forecast for
a 25 percent to 30 percent increase in Mexico and more than a
50 percent gain in  Brazil , Astaburuaga said.  
 ``If the perspective on grains has changed, it has changed
a little bit to the negative in the last couple of months,''
Astaburuaga said.  
 The company isn't currently planning to raise prices again
after increases in Mexico and Brazil during the first quarter
to help make up for higher grain costs, he said. Femsa boosted
average prices in Mexico by about 5 percent, he said.  
 ``The big one is already in place,'' he said, referring to
the price increase in Mexico.  
 Heineken Agreement  
 Beer exports rose 13 percent to 768,800 hectoliters. The
company's beer-export growth has gained since it signed an
agreement for Heineken NV to distribute its brands in the U.S.  
 Fernandez said he expects exports to increase more than 10
percent annually even the  U.S. economy  slows.  
 Grupo Modelo SAB, the Mexican brewer of Corona beer, had a
7.7 percent decline in export volumes during the first quarter
because of a weaker U.S. market and a price increase last year.
Modelo said April 24 that sales outside Mexico fell 13 percent
to 6.23 billion pesos because of the declining U.S. dollar.  
 Modelo, Mexico's largest beermaker and Femsa's only
domestic rival, said its Mexican beer sales volume rose 2.6
percent to 8.15 hectoliters.  
 In the first quarter, Femsa spent about $180 million of
its $1.2 billion investment budget for 2008 to expand capacity
and boost efficiency at its three units. The company may fail
to spend all it had planned this year as some projects get
pushed back, Astaburuaga said, without specifying any delays.
