             Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings
Ltd. (YZJSGD) , the biggest Singapore-listed Chinese shipbuilder, said
first-quarter profit doubled on higher sales of containerships.  
 Net income  rose to 371.3 million  yuan  ($53 million) in the
three months ended March 31, compared with 183.5 million yuan a
year earlier, the Jiangyin-based company said in a statement
today. Revenue jumped 86 percent to 1.69 billion yuan.  
 Yangzijiang has orders worth $6.8 billion and expects
profit to advance more than 50 percent this year, it said in the
statement. The company plans to increase its shipbuilding
capacity by 2 million deadweight tons from 300,000 deadweight
tons by the end of 2010, Singapore's  Business Times  reported
today, citing Chairman Ren Yuan Lin. It's also considering
raising the capacity at its yard in Jiangyin city by 20 percent,
the newspaper said.  
 The shipbuilder has orders for delivery in 2011 and 2012
and expects to meet this year's target of 50 vessels, the report
said. The company had 19 vessels under construction as of the
end of March, after delivering five during the first quarter, it
said in today's statement. Yangzijiang didn't pay a dividend.
