             Kuwait Projects Co. Holding K.S.C.,
or KIPCO, will buy up to 55 percent of Arab Orient Insurance
Company in the coming few weeks to gain entry to the Jordanian
market.  
 ``KIPCO will buy Jordan Kuwait Bank's stake in AOIC in order
to merge it with its insurance unit, Gulf Insurance Company,''
 Isam Abdel Khaliq , general manger at AOIC, said today in a
telephone interview from Jordan. Jordan Kuwait Bank owns about 66
percent of AOIC, he said.  
 Abdel Khaliq didn't disclose the price of the transaction.
The management team at AOIC won't be changed, while the name may
become Gulf Insurance Company-Jordan, he said. KIPCO is Kuwait's
largest non-state-owned investment firm.  
 AOIC, based in Amman, was established in 1996 and is the
largest insurance company in Jordan with 9 percent stake of the
market.  
 ``We have achieved around 650,000 Jordanian dinars
($910,000) in net profit for the first quarter of 2008,'' Abdel
Khaliq said.  
 ``The KIPCO group did announce that we were looking at ways
of restructuring our financial service companies. We can not
confirm the details given in this statement,'' KIPCO spokesman
Robert Hipkins said in a telephone interview.
