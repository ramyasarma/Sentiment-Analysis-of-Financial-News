German Lawmakers have agreed on three
candidates for the country’s top constitutional court,
Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported without saying where it got the
information.  Berlin law professor Susanne Baer will replace Brun-Otto
Bryde at the Karlsruhe-based court, according to the newspaper.
Peter Michael Huber, now interior minister in the state of
Thuringia, will take Siegfried Bross’ seat and Monika Hermanns,
currently at the Federal Court of Justice, will replace Lerke
Osterloh.  The three will be formally nominated on Nov. 11 by the
parliamentary committee that elects federal judges, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
