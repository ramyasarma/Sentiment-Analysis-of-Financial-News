The  profit  from shipping gasoline to
the U.S. from Europe slumped to a 20-month low in October as
strikes in France caused domestic shortages, cutting exports.  U.S. gasoline cost 8.05 cents less than Europe’s on Oct.
19, the lowest level since February 2009, and is still down 9.5
percent from its  average  of 8.41 cents more than Europe’s in the
past year. As the premium disappeared, the number of tankers
chartered to ship the motor fuel to the U.S. Atlantic Coast from
Europe dropped to 10 last month, from 28 in September, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg and  Clarkson  Research Services
Ltd., a unit of the world’s biggest shipbroker.  Strikes in France over plans to raise the pension and
retirement age shut nine of 11 French refineries, leaving
service stations without fuel and slashing stockpiles. The
disruption cost oil-processors 230 million euros ($323 million),
according to Union Francaise des Industries Petrolieres, a
Paris-based industry group.  Total SA , Europe’s biggest refiner,
said it lost about 100 million euros.  “Europe is asking for more diesel and sending less
gasoline as a result of the French strikes,” said  Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at Credit Agricole CIB,
France’s third-largest bank. “French stocks have to be
rebuilt.” The protests cut French gasoline exports by 100,000
barrels a day this month and last, he said.  Vessels carried 375,000 metric tons of gasoline to the U.S.
in October, compared with 1.08 million tons in the previous
month. The French protests also led to a 31 percent increase in
diesel exports to Europe to meet shortfalls.  Falling Demand  “There’s not enough of a differential to encourage a lot
of volume to the U.S.,” said  Thomas Zwick , an analyst at
shipping consultants Lorentzen & Stemoco AS in Oslo, referring
to gasoline.  U.S.  gasoline  demand fell 0.8 percent last week, the second
consecutive drop,  MasterCard Inc. , the second-biggest payments
network company, said in its Nov. 2 SpendingPulse report.
Motorists bought an average 9.03 million barrels a day in the
week ended Oct. 29, it said. Consumption was the lowest in three
weeks.  Inventories dropped 2.69 million barrels in the week ended
Oct. 29 to 212.3 million, according to the U.S. Energy
Department. That’s the lowest level since Nov. 20 last year,
leaving supplies 6 percent above the  five-year  average.  “Some gasoline volumes from other parts of Europe were
diverted to France, and that has been reflected in lower
European exports to the United States during September and
October,” the Energy Department said in its Nov. 3 “This Week
in Petroleum”  report .  Diesel Tankers  Diesel shipments from the U.S. to Europe jumped in October
as  premiums  climbed to the highest level in almost 10 months.
Traders and oil companies chartered at least 12 tankers for
shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast last month, up from eight in
September, according to Clarkson. The vessels carried 456,000
tons, compared with 348,000 tons in September.  The premium, or arbitrage margin, on  European diesel 
relative to the  U.S.  rose to 13.21 cents a gallon on Oct. 19,
the highest level since Dec. 9, 2009, according to spot price
data compiled by Bloomberg, up from an average 7.75 cents in
October and 4.67 cents in September. It was 5.78 cents today.  “The transatlantic diesel arbitrage was opened by both
planned and unexpected refinery outages in Europe and was
widened by the French refinery strikes,” said  Filip Petersson ,
a Stockholm-based commodities strategist at SEB AB. “We expect
the diesel arbitrage to stay open at least into early 2011.”  Heating Oil, Diesel  European refineries don’t produce enough distillate to meet
demand in the region, where diesel-engine cars are commonplace.
About 600,000 barrels a day, or 10 percent of its needs, was
covered through imports last year, according to Jonathan Leitch,
a London-based senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd.
Russia was the biggest supplier, he said.  Heating oil and diesel stockpiles in France fell to 53.2
million barrels at the end of October, Barret said. That’s down
from 63.7 million at the end of the previous month and below the
average of 61.3 million barrels from 2003 to 2008, according to
Credit Agricole estimates.  French inventories of heating oil and diesel fell below 53
million barrels at the end of last month, Credit Agricole
reported on Nov. 1. They probably won’t return to the 2003-2008
average level of about 61.6 million barrels until the middle of
next year, it said.  Distillate stockpiles  in the U.S. fell for a sixth week on
a drop in imports, declining 3.57 million barrels to 164.9
million, the Energy Department said. It was the biggest decline
since the week ending April 3, 2009.  The shipping fixtures from Clarkson in London were for
single-voyage bookings, and excluded long-term charters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
