(Corrects time frame in first paragraph, points in third.)  Brazil’s benchmark  Bovespa  index may
reach 90,000 points by the second half of next year, said  Will Landers , portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc.  The index’s “price-to-earnings ratio is still one of the
lowest between the emerging countries,” Landers said yesterday
in a telephone interview from New Jersey. The index should
“easily” beat its current record, he said.  The Bovespa fell 0.4 percent to 72,684 today at 10:25 a.m.
New York time today. Yesterday, it rose to 72,996, the highest
level in more than two years. It reached its record of 73,517
points in May 2008.  “Our portfolio is more focused on companies targeting the
real economy, like banks and home builders.” Landers helps
oversee $10 billion in Latin America, 70 percent of which is
invested in Brazil.  The U.S. Federal Reserve announced Nov. 3 it will purchase
about $75 billion of Treasuries a month through June, for a
total of $600 billion, because of “disappointingly slow”
progress in boosting economic growth. Such decisions favor the
emerging markets’ currencies and put more downward pressure on
the dollar, Landers said.  “With the economy growing, the need for foreign investment
in infrastructure, there will be lots of investors interested in
Brazil,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
