European Union carbon-dioxide
allowances advanced after prices dropped to a three-month low
yesterday, prompting the return of buyers and pushing volumes to
the highest level since Sept. 2.  EU permits for December gained 0.5 percent to 14.45 euros
($20.51) a metric ton as of 9:09 a.m. on London’s European
Climate Exchange. They closed at 14.38 euros yesterday, the
lowest level since Aug. 6.  The volume traded in the benchmark futures contract more
than doubled yesterday to 15.7 million tons from 6.7 million
tons a day earlier, ECX said. UN credits for December rose 0.8
percent today to 12.07 euros a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
