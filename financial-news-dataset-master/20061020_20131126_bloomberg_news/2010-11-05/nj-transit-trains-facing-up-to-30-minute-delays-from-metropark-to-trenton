New Jersey Transit said Northeast
Corridor outbound trains face delays of 20 minutes to 30 minutes
from Metropark to Trenton because of a disabled train and switch
problems. The agency, which earlier put the delays at 10 minutes
to 15 minutes, commented in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
