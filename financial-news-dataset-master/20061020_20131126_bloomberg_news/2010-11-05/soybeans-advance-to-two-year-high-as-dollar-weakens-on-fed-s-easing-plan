Soybeans gained for a third day to a
two-year high on prospects for further weakness in the dollar
after the Federal Reserve announced plans expand stimulus,
boosting demand for commodities as an alternative investments.  The oilseed for January delivery climbed as much as 1.2
percent to $12.895 a bushel, the highest level since Sept. 3,
2008, on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at $12.8875 at
10:41 a.m. in Tokyo. The contract is set for a fifth weekly gain,
the longest winning streak since the six weeks to June 5, 2009.  “The dollar’s weakness has sent most commodities higher,”
said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager of research at IDO
Securities Co. in Tokyo. The oilseed market has also been
supported by Chinese demand, he said.  The Fed said on Nov. 3 that it will buy an additional $600
billion of Treasuries through June and keep interest rates low
for an “extended period.” The  Dollar Index  was little changed
at 75.904 today after declining to an 11-month low yesterday.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 commodities rose
yesterday to the highest level since Oct. 3, 2008. Soybeans have
gained 43 percent since the end of June and corn has jumped 58
percent on reduced global production.  Corn for December delivery declined as much as 0.3 percent
to $5.88 a bushel. The price touched $5.9575 yesterday, the
highest level since Aug. 29, 2008.  Corn Harvest  The corn harvest will be 12.521 billion bushels, less than
the 12.664 billion forecast by the USDA last month, the Linn
Group said yesterday. The soybean crop will be 3.483 billion
bushels, more than the agency forecast of 3.408 billion, the
research and brokerage firm said. The government will update its
forecasts on Nov. 9.  Wheat for December delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent to
$7.23 a bushel, and last traded at $7.20. The grain has surged
50 percent since the end of June after drought destroyed Russian
crops, prompting the country to ban exports.  Rough-rice for January delivery gained 0.7 percent to
$14.965 per 100 pounds. On Oct. 28, the contract touched $15.27,
the highest level since Jan. 4. The price has risen 1.6 percent
this week, gaining for an 11th straight week. Rice has jumped 55
percent since the end of June as flooding damaged crops in
Thailand and Vietnam, the world’s two biggest exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
