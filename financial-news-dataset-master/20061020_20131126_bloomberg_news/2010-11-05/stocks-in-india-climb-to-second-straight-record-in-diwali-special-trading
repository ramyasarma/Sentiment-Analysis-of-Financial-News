India’s stocks climbed to a record
close for a second straight day in a truncated trading session,
as investors increased their holdings amid expectations the
nation’s economic growth will boost corporate earnings.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 111.39, or 0.5 percent, to 21,004.96 in Mumbai,
surpassing yesterday’s close of 20,893.57. The S&P CNX Nifty
Index on the National Stock Exchange rose 0.5 percent to a
record 6,312.45.  Indian stock exchanges held a special truncated trading
session today to allow brokers and investors to make token stock
purchases during the one-hour trading session on Diwali, the
festival of light and the start of the Hindu new year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
