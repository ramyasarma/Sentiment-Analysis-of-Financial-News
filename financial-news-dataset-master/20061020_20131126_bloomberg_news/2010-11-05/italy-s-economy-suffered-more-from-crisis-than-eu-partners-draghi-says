Italy’s economy has suffered more
from the global recession than its European Union partners as
competiveness slumped, Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi  said.  “Our economy has been hurt more than others,” he said in
a speech in Ancona, Italy, today. “This is manifested by an
inability to grow at sustained levels. In the most recent
recession, Italian  gross domestic product  has contracted almost
7 percentage points.”  During the first 10 years of the European economic and
monetary union from 1998 to 2008, Italian productivity gained 3
percent, compared with an increase of 22 percent in Germany and
18 percent in France, he said. Labor costs have risen 29 percent
in Italy, compared with 20 percent in Germany.  Italy has lagged behind other economies due to many of its
companies being too small to compete globally, competition
lacking in service industries and a two-tier labor market with
permanent-job contracts or temporary contracts with no security,
Draghi said.  Italy compares more favorably with other economies when
broader measures of well-being are factored in, such as life
expectancy and personal savings, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
