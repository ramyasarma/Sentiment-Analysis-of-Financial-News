Thomas C. Werner , the chairman of
Major League Baseball’s Boston Red Sox, will assume the same
role at 18-time English soccer champion Liverpool when British
Airways Plc chairman  Martin Broughton  steps down.  Werner and fellow Red Sox owner  John W. Henry ’s New England
Sports Ventures LLC completed a 300-million-pound ($487 million)
deal to buy the soccer team on Oct. 15.  Susan Goodenow , a spokeswoman for NESV, confirmed Werner’s
role in an interview today.  Broughton was appointed to the post at Liverpool in April,
and charged with finding a buyer for the club as part of an
agreement by Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. to
give former owners  George Gillett  and  Tom Hicks  a six-month
extension to repay a 237-million-pound debt. It’s unclear when
Broughton will officially step down.  Werner, Henry and Henry’s wife Linda Pizzuti attended
Liverpool’s 3-1 home victory over Napoli in the Europa League
yesterday. The team hosts  Premier League champion Chelsea in
two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
