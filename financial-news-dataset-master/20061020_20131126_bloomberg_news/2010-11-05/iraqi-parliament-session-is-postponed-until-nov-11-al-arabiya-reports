The next meeting of the Iraqi
parliament has been postponed until Nov. 11, al-Arabiya
television said, citing Fuad Massoum, acting speaker of the
assembly. He had called for lawmakers to return to the chamber
on Nov. 8. Since the inconclusive March 7 election, lawmakers
have met once, on June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
