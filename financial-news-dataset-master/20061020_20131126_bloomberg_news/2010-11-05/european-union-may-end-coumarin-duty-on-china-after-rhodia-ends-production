The European Union may scrap a 14-
year-old tariff on imports from China of a chemical used in
cosmetics and perfumes because France’s  Rhodia SA  stopped making
it in the EU.  The European Commission opened a review into whether to
remove the duty on coumarin of 3,479 euros ($4,923) a metric
ton, a step that would aid importers and users such as Germany’s
 Henkel AG . The probe will last as long as 15 months.  Rhodia was the 27-nation EU’s only maker of coumarin until
the company ceased production in August, according to the
commission. The EU introduced the import tax in 1996 and
prolonged it most recently in 2008 for five years to help Rhodia
compete against below-cost -- or “dumped” -- imports from
China.  “An examination will be made as to whether or not the
maintenance of the existing anti-dumping measures is
warranted,” the commission, the EU’s trade authority in
Brussels, said today in the  Official Journal . “Changes have
occurred to the Union industry of coumarin.”  In the past six years, the EU has extended the duty against
China to Indonesia, Malaysia, India and Thailand after
concluding that  Chinese exporters  shipped coumarin via those
four countries to evade the levy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
