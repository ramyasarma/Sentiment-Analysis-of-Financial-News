The  Reserve Bank of India  has barred
three foreign banks from trading in government bonds for six
months after they violated trading norms, the Economic Times
reported today, citing people it didn’t identify.  Societe Generale  SA, Standard Chartered Plc and Credit
Agricole SA’s corporate and investment banking unit, formerly
called Calyon, were banned after investigations revealed
circular trading in which bonds were sold at off-market prices
to hide losses, the report said.  Alpana Killawala , a central bank spokeswoman, confirmed the
newspaper report.  “Credit Agricole does not comment on market rumors,” said
Joyce Lam, a spokeswoman for Paris-based Credit Agricole’s
corporate and investment banking unit. Gabriel Kwan, a
spokeswoman for Standard Chartered in Hong Kong, wasn’t
immediately available for a comment. Societe Generale spokesman
Laurent Tison declined to comment on the report.  The banks can continue to participate in primary auctions,
open-market operations conducted by the central bank, buy back
offers from the government and the Reserve Bank’s money-market
auctions, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
