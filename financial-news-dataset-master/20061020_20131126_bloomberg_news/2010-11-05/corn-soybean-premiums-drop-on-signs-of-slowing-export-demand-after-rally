Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans this month fell,
signaling slowing demand after futures jumped to the highest
level since 2008.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
November fell to 49 cents to 53 cents a bushel above December
futures, compared with 49 cents to 57 cents yesterday,
government  data  show.  Soybean  premiums dropped to 40 cents to 48
cents above January futures from 40 cents to 56 cents.  “This weakness at the Gulf hints that end-users, having
acquired some inventory prior to the recent run-up, are probably
protesting the big jump in prices,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm-
marketing adviser at Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in
Nashville, Illinois. Buyers “are deciding to wait and see if
prices can back off,” he said.  The  average spot price  for soybeans rose to $13.28 a bushel
today, the highest level since September 2008. Spot  corn  dropped
to $6.3875 a bushel after climbing yesterday to the highest
level since August 2008.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 2.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $5.8775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Yesterday, the contract rose to $5.9575, the highest
level since September 2008.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 9.25 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $12.84 a bushel. Earlier, the oilseed reached
$12.90, the highest level for a most-active contract since Sept.
3, 2008.  Buyers are wary before the USDA releases forecasts for U.S.
corn and soybean production on Nov. 9, Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
