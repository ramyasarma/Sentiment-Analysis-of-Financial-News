Taiwan’s  consumer prices  rose for a
second straight month after a typhoon destroyed crops, pushing
up food and transportation costs.  The consumer price index advanced 0.56 percent in October
from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in Taipei today.
That compared with the median  estimate  for a 0.3 percent
increase in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists. Prices
rose a revised 0.28 percent in September.  Taiwan  is on course to be one of the world’s fastest-
growing economies this year after expanding 13.1 percent in the
first half. While the recovery has failed to ignite overall
inflation, the central bank raised borrowing costs in September
for the second time in 2010 to ward off a property bubble.  “In an environment where the global economy is looking
healthier,” the central bank will probably raise the benchmark
interest rate by another 0.125 percentage point in December,  Tim Condon , head of Asia research at ING Groep NV, said before the
release. The bank may boost borrowing costs by a total of 0.75
percentage point within a year from the current rate of 1.5
percent, he said.  Today’s report was released after the close of trading on
the stock exchange. The Taiex index climbed 1.1 percent. The
Taiwan dollar closed 0.1 percent higher at NT$30.560 versus the
U.S. currency, and rose as much as 1.8 percent earlier, its
biggest daily gain since January 2000, according to Taipei Forex
Inc.  Typhoon Megi caused agricultural losses of NT$136 million
($4.5 million) in October, the Taipei-based Council of
Agriculture said in a statement on its website on Nov. 2.  Food Prices  Food prices rose 0.23 percent from a year earlier, today’s
report showed. The price of transportation advanced 1.22 percent
and clothing prices climbed 0.16 percent.  Core consumer prices , a category excluding vegetables,
fruit, fish and energy, increased 0.57 percent after gaining
0.71 percent in September.  Wholesale prices, which track the cost of goods sold to
retailers and producers, climbed 3.84 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a revised 3.79 percent increase in
September.  Inflation this year may be less than the 1.23 percent
estimated by the statistics bureau,  Perng Fai-nan , the governor
of the central bank, said last month. It may exceed that figure
in 2011, he also said.  Perng and the policy board raised the benchmark interest
rate to 1.5 percent in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
