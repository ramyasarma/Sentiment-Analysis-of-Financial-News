British Broadcasting Corp.
journalists, including radio and television news presenters,
started a 48-hour strike over pensions today, forcing the state-
funded broadcaster to curtail programs and run pre-recorded
shows, the Daily Telegraph reported, citing union leaders.  Much of the organization’s 24-hour news channel, Radio 5
Live, was devoted to prerecorded., and the BBC News 24
television channel ran old feature material and interviews, the
newspaper said.  BBC news staff are protesting against plans to curtail
final salary pensions in an effort to bridge a fund shortfall of
as much as 2 billion pounds ($3.25 billion), according to the
Telegraph.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
