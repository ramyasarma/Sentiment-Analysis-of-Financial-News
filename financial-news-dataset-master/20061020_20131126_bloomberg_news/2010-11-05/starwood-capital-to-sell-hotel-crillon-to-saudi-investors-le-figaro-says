Starwood Capital Group LLC is about
to sell the  Hotel de Crillon  to Saudi investors with ties to the
royal family for 250 million euros ($355 million),  Le Figaro 
reported, citing unidentified people close to the transaction.  The buyer will have to spend another 100 million euros to
renovate the Paris luxury hotel, located at the central Place de
la Concorde, according to the French daily. Management of the
hotel will probably be entrusted to Munich-based Kempinski AG,
Le Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
