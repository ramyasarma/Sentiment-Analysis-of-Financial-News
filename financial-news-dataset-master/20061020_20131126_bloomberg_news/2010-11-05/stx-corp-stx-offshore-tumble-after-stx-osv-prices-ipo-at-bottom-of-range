STX Corp.  tumbled the most in almost
22 months in Seoul trading and STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co.
plunged after an offshore-vessel making affiliate priced its
initial public offering at the bottom of the range.  STX Corp., the holding company for South Korea’s STX Group,
slumped 13 percent, the most since January 2009, to close at
28,500 won on the Korea Exchange.  STX Offshore  dropped 15
percent, the most since November 2008, to 23,900 won. STX Engine
Co. fell 12 percent to close at 36,800 won.  STX OSV yesterday priced its IPO shares at 79 Singaporean
cents apiece, compared with a maximum possible price of S$1.13,
according to terms sent to investors. The  company  will use the
expected $142.2 million gross proceeds from the sale to help
build a second shipyard in Brazil and boost capacity at other
facilities making rig-support vessels.  “Investors seem to be disappointed,” said  Lee Sang Hwa , a
Seoul-based analyst at Hyundai Securities Co. “STX OSV sold
fewer shares than anticipated and its IPO was priced at a low
level, reducing the amount of cash inflow to the company.”  STX OSV is selling 180 million new shares, while STX Europe
Holding AS is offering 145.6 million shares. STX Offshore is the
largest shareholder in STX Europe, ahead of STX Engine.  Shares of STX OSV begin trading Nov. 12. DBS Group Holdings
Ltd., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Nordea Bank Finland Plc and
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc arranged the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
