Treasuries declined, while U.S.
stocks fluctuated at the end of a fifth straight weekly rally,
as faster-than-forecast growth in American jobs spurred
speculation the Federal Reserve will limit its stimulus plans.  The  yield  on the 10-year Treasury note rose three basis
points to 2.51 percent at 9:33 a.m. in New York. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, which surged to a two-year high yesterday,
drifted between gains and losses near the 1,221 level. The
Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six peers,
snapped a three-day slide. Indexes of commodities climbed to
two-year highs.                        Payrolls climbed 151,000, exceeding the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and following a revised
41,000 drop the prior month that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed. Stocks are headed
for their best  week  in two months, with the MSCI World Index
near a two-year high, after the Fed pledged on Nov. 3 to buy up
to $600 billion of Treasuries to bolster the economy and adjust
the buying program as needed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
