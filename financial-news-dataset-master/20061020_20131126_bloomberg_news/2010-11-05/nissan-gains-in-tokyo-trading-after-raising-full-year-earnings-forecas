Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-
largest automaker, rose the most in 11 months in Tokyo trading
after posting higher-than-expected earnings and raising its
full-year profit forecast yesterday.  The automaker gained as much as 6.7 percent to 769 yen, the
biggest intraday advance since Dec. 3, and traded at 765 yen as
of 10:03 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Nissan expects 270 billion yen ($3.3 billion) net income in
the year ending March 31, compared with an earlier forecast of
150 billion yen, the Yokohama-based company said yesterday. The
carmaker posted  102 billion yen  in net income for the three
months ended Sept. 30, beating the 89 billion yen average
estimate of 6 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, as sales rose to
2.27 trillion yen from 1.87 trillion yen a year earlier.  Even so, the company estimates profit growth may slow
during the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on the revised
forecast, Nissan may post net income of 62 billion yen during
the six months through March 31. That estimate is more than two-
thirds lower than the fiscal first-half profit of 208 billion
yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
