WestLB AG Chief Executive Officer
Dietrich Voigtlaender said the failure of merger talks with
Bayerische Landesbank doesn’t push the Dusseldorf, Germany-based
lender closer to collapse in an interview in Handelsblatt.  Voigtlaender said he doesn’t understand why BayernLB ended
the negotiations, according to the newspaper.  The CEO had broad support from his supervisory board even
before the talks began, he is cited as saying. Voigtlaender said
the possibility of consolidation among Germany’s state-owned
banks still exists and that is a path WestLB is still pursuing,
Handelsblatt said.  At the same time, efforts to find a buyer for WestLB are
going to plan, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
