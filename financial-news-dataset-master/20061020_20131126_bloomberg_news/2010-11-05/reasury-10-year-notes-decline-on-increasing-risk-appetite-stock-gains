U.S. five-year Treasury yields stayed
near a record low before a report that economists said will show
U.S. payrolls increased last month for the first time since May.  Ten-year notes were little changed, headed for the biggest
weekly advance in a month, after the Federal Reserve said this
week that it will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries
through June to stimulate growth. The U.S. plans to auction $72
billion in its quarterly sales of long-term debt next week.  “The market is just taking a pause for breath after strong
gains, before today’s employment report,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd., a broker for money managers. “I doubt the figures will be
strong enough to prevent yields falling further.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was at 2.49 percent
as of 9 a.m. in London, according to BGCantor Market Data. The
price of the 2.625 percent security due in August 2020 was at
101 6/32. The yield has declined 11 basis points this week, the
biggest drop since the five days ended Oct. 8.  Five-year  yields  were at 1.04 percent, after falling to a
record 1.0148 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
