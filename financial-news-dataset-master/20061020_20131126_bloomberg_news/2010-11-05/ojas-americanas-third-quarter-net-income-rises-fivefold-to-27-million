Lojas Americanas SA , Brazil’s biggest
discount retailer, had the third-biggest jump in the  Bovespa 
index after it said third-quarter profit rose almost sixfold as
it opened stores to benefit from the Brazilian economy’s growth.  Lojas Americanas  preferred shares rose 1.2 percent to 19.02
reais at 10:20 a.m. New York time in Sao Paulo trading. Net
income increased to 45.1 million reais ($26.9 million) from 7.9
million reais a year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based company
said in a  statement  on its  website . The  mean estimate  for profit
excluding some items was 27.6 million reais in a Bloomberg
survey of seven analysts.  “Lojas Americanas came in very well with expanding
margins,” said  Fabio Spinola , who helps oversee $1 billion as
equity strategist at Sao Paulo-based hedge fund Quest
Investimentos Ltda. “Consumer demand is really booming. It’s
incredible.”  Retail sales in Latin America’s largest economy rose 10.4
percent in August from a year ago, after climbing 11.1 percent
in July, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics in Rio de Janeiro. Gross domestic product is forecast
to grow 7.6 percent this year, according to a central bank
survey published Nov. 1.  Net sales at Lojas Americanas rose 16 percent to 1.2
billion reais in the third quarter, while consolidated sales
including its subsidiaries rose 13 percent to 2.26 billion

open another 35 by year-end, according to the statement. The
company plans to open 400 stores in Brazil through 2013.  Net income at  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo , Brazil’s biggest
online retailer and a unit of Lojas Americanas, fell 75 percent
