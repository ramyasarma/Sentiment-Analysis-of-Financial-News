Peru’s sol headed for its biggest
weekly rise since August as the Federal Reserve’s measures to
boost the U.S. economy lifted commodity prices and fueled demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market currencies.  The sol strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.7930 per U.S. dollar
at 12:44 p.m. New York time, from 2.7985 on Oct. 29. The
currency was little changed today.  The Fed’s plan to buy an additional $600 billion of
Treasuries to boost liquidity has weakened the dollar and
boosted demand prospects for commodities, which account for
three quarters of Peru’s exports, said  Mike Moran , a currency
strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. Prices for
copper and gold, Peru’s top exports, rose.  “We are edging back towards this weak-dollar environment,
at least for the next month,” Moran said.  Peru’s central bank will offer 150 million soles ($53.7
million) of certificates redeemable in dollars at an auction
today, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
