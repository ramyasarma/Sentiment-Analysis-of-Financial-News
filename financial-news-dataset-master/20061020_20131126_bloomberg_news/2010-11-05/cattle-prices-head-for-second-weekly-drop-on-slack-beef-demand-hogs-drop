Cattle prices fell in Chicago,
heading for the second straight weekly decline, on signs of
slack demand for beef. Hog prices also dropped.  U.S. exporters sold 10,933 metric tons of beef in the week
ended Oct. 28, down 45 percent from a week earlier, government
data show. Yesterday, wholesale-choice  beef  fell 0.5 percent to
$1.5901 a pound, the lowest level in two weeks.  Beef-export sales were “disappointing,” said  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity Investments Co.
in Minneapolis. “Cutouts were down yesterday. Movement has been
slow.”  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.5 cent, or 0.5
percent, to 97.15 cents a pound at 11:08 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price rose 13 percent in
2010.  The dollar rose as much as 1 percent against a basket of
major currencies, reducing the appeal of U.S. meat exports,
Mayer said.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.65 cent, or 1
percent, to 66.975 cents a pound. Before today, the commodity
rose 3.1 percent this year.  In the week ended Oct. 30, hogs in Iowa and southern
Minnesota, the largest U.S. producing region, weighed 2.1
percent more on average than a year earlier, signaling
increasing meat supplies.  “Weights are above a year ago,” Mayer said. “A lot of
product on the market” is pushing prices lower, he said.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement were unchanged
at $1.104 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
