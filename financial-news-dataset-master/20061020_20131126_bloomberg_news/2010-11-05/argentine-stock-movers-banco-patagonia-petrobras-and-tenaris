Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR)  rose today the
most in almost two years on speculation of a possible stake
sale. Alvaro Saieh, the controller of bank Corpbanca, denied
being one of the possible buyers.  La Polar rose 7.5 percent to 2,738.7 pesos at 4:13 p.m. New
York time, the most since May 2009.  The stock jumped on speculation of a possible sale to a
local businessman, Maria Jesus Bofill, an analyst at the
brokerage unit of Banco de Credito & Inversiones, said by
telephone today.  “We are not buying La Polar,” Alvaro Saieh said in an e-
mailed response to questions today. Saieh had been mentioned as
a possible buyer, Bofill said earlier.  Santiago Grage, La Polar’s chief financial officer and
investor relations manager, wasn’t available to comment, an
assistant said by phone.  La Polar reported March 17 a 38 percent fall in 2010 profit
to 29.8 billion pesos ($62.4 million), after announcing $150
million in provisions to counter higher delinquency rates in its
consumer credit business. The stock had fallen 25 percent this
year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
