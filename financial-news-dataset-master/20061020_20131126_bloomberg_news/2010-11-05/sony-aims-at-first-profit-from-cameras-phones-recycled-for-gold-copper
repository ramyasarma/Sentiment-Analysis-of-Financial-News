Sony Corp . may post a profit for the
first time from its metals recycling operation this fiscal year
by collecting more used consumer electronics in Japan after
prices of the materials surged.  The Tokyo-based maker of Cyber-shot cameras plans to
collect 80,000 gadgets such as mobile phones, digital cameras,
portable media players and audio recorders, Kazuya Kazo, who
heads the company’s resources recycling section, said in an
interview today. Sony retrieved 32,000 such devices to recover
metals in the year ended March 31, he said.  Japan’s  biggest exporter  of consumer electronics is turning
to used goods as part of its plan to stabilize procurement of
metals such as palladium and gold, Kazo said. Gold for immediate
delivery reached a record $1,394.41 an ounce today has risen 26
percent this year, while silver has gained 57 percent. Copper is
traded in London at its highest since July 2008.  Sony started collecting discarded electronics in Kitakyushu
city, southern Japan in 2008, and expanded the operation to a
second city in June, Kazo said. The company may start similar
recycling in other areas in the nation to boost efficiency,
although there is currently no plan to recycle gadgets overseas,
he said.  The company recovered 300 kilograms of copper, 161 grams of
gold, 800 grams of silver as well as smaller amounts of rare
metals such as palladium and nickel in the year ended March 31,
according to Ayano Iguchi, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
