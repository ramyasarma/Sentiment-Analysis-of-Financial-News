Republican National Committee
Chairman Michael Steele, in an interview on “Political Capital
with Al Hunt” airing this weekend on Bloomberg Television,
embraced former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s ability to
galvanize voters and urged the Republican Party establishment to
“chill out.”  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  MICHAEL STEELE: Thanks, Al. Thank you.  HUNT: How big a role did the RNC play in the Republican
victory on Tuesday?  STEELE: I think a fairly big role. I mean, we -- I’ve
always referred to us as the -- the Marines in politics. We go
where no one wants to go and do what no one else can do. We laid
out about $175 million over the course of this cycle, starting
with the elections in ‘09, New Jersey and Virginia, and the wins
there, and building up a ground game through 360 victory offices
around the country, which is double what we’ve had in -- had in
2008.  Doing a 50-state strategy, the first time the party’s ever
engaged in all 50 states of the union.  HUNT: And it was a big victory. There’s no question about
it. Yet as I looked at the election polls, you won more seats in
the House than any -- since 1938.  STEELE: Yes.  HUNT: Picked up state legislatures, governors. But the
Republican brand, according to the exit polls --  STEELE: It still needs some work.  HUNT: It’s just as bad as the Democrats. They don’t like
Republicans any more than --  STEELE: And that’s the interesting dynamic of this
election. What I found -- on my six-week “Fire Pelosi” bus
tour --  HUNT: Right.  STEELE: We traveled through all 48 contiguous states and
talking to folks on the ground. And basically what they were
saying was a pox on both your houses, that this is a
probationary period for the GOP. This isn’t, you know, the
prodigal party coming back home and everybody’s like embracing
us.  HUNT: So you have to deliver?  STEELE: Yes, you’ve got to deliver, and you’re already
beginning to see the leadership on the Hill clearly define the
direction they want to go in, and that’s going to be interesting
to watch over the next couple months.  HUNT: Speaking of delivering, you also made major gains in
governor’s races and in state legislatures. And you look at
places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, you’ve just done --
how many congressional seats do you think you’ll pick up because
of those gains with redistricting?  STEELE: Well, right now, because of the -- the key thing to
start with here is the fact that we flipped 21 state
legislatures on Tuesday night, which now puts us in control for
the redistricting purposes 196 congressional districts across
the country.  HUNT: How many do you think you’ll gain because of that
control?  STEELE: It just depends on how the lines are going to be
drawn in each district, but, yes, you’re looking at solidifying
the gains we made on Tuesday and probably adding potentially
another 10, 15 or so seats. But that’s -- I mean, that’s today.
I don’t know -- once we start doing the math and doing the maps
-- you get a better sense of it. But the goal --  HUNT: Mr. Chairman, it’s days after the last polls closed.
There’s been some controversy over your stewardship, as you
know. Do you expect to be president, as chairman of the
Republican national party in Tampa, Florida, in August --  (CROSSTALK)  STEELE: I don’t know. I haven’t decided that yet. I’m still
-  HUNT: Where are you leaning right now?  STEELE: Well, I’m not leaning anywhere. I’m really -- to be
honest with you, I’m really kind of evaluating and assessing
where we are as a party and what we need to do. I’m looking at,
you know, whether my vision of what the party needs to do and
where it needs to go, it fits what has to happen next.  HUNT: When will you decide?  STEELE: Probably in a few weeks.  HUNT: In a few weeks.  STEELE: Yes, not rushing.  HUNT: And you’re not leaning either way right now?  STEELE: I’m not rushing right now. No, let’s -- let’s
absorb the -- the victory.  HUNT: One of your critics - and there are some, as you know
-  STEELE: No, I don’t have any critics.  HUNT: Is the Mississippi governor and former party chairman
Haley Barbour --  STEELE: Yes.  HUNT: -- who on election night said the RNC -- and I’m
going to quote him -- “made this campaign tougher,” and the
Republican governors and the Senate and House committees, quote,
“had to scramble around and increase their resources beyond
what was normal because the RNC was not able to do what it had
done in the past.”  That’s Haley Barbour.  STEELE: Yes, and he’s -- he’s wrong. He’s just flat-out
wrong, and he knows it. I don’t know if he considered the $14
million we put into the - the elections in 2009 as part of that.
We raised $185 million over this cycle. And I appreciate the
governor’s position. But Governor Barbour can raise unlimited
cash --  HUNT: For the RGA.  STEELE: For the RGA. I’m limited by campaign finance laws
to $30,000 max from any one donor. And to raise $185 million, in
you know, in $47 increments, because that was our average
donation, it’s not bad. But we --  HUNT: But why did the DNC out-raise you for the first time,
first time ever?  STEELE: No, it’s not the first time ever.  HUNT: Yes, it is.  STEELE: No, it’s not the first time.  HUNT: I mean, you’re going back to ‘92, since soft money
was first --  (CROSSTALK)  STEELE: Oh, no. We -- we outraised the DNC in the same
period in 2006. We raised what they did in exact same position
in 2006, when they were trying to capture the House.  HUNT: Why were so -- you were $25 million behind them this
time. Is that -- was that a --  (CROSSTALK)  STEELE: Well, they have the White House, the Congress, and
the Senate. I don’t have the White House, the Congress, and the
Senate.  HUNT: That makes a difference?  STEELE: It makes a big difference when the president of the
United States can go do a $4 million or $5 million fundraiser
for you. So I think we’ve been competitive.  But the thing that people need to understand in this town
is that the dynamics have changed. Because of the change of --
the decision by the Supreme Court in the most recent ruling,
Citizens United, we have 527s now that can really engage in the
political process. And both political parties are less major
dollar players and more small-dollar donors, because if you’ve
got $1 million, you can’t give it to us. You can give it to, you
know, one of these committees.  Case in point. Karl Rove’s group had one donor a couple of
weeks before the election give a -- contribute a $7 million
check.  HUNT: And you can’t do that?  STEELE: I need -- I need about 150,000 donors to get to $7
million.  HUNT: You brought up Karl Rove. Karl and others have --
have dumped on Sarah Palin --  STEELE: Right.  HUNT: -- and suggested she shouldn’t be the nominee, some
of the same people who are criticizing you, it appears.  STEELE: Right.  HUNT: Sort of the Republican establishment, if you will.
Why do you think they all have problems with you and Sarah
Palin? And would you like to see Governor Palin run for
president?  STEELE: Well, Governor Palin will do what’s in the best
interest of her family and herself and then -- and hopefully,
you know, decide whether that fits in the direction of the
country. So we’ll -- we’ll save for a decision she’ll make
later.  From my standpoint, yes, we -- we are different in that
we’re from the grassroots. I’m a grassroots guy, grew up here on
the streets of Washington, D.C., politically. And, you know, my
style and my approach to politics is not status quo. It’s not
protecting the institutions.  HUNT: And that’s -- and that is --  STEELE: It’s exposing the institutions.  HUNT: That is the other -- some of the establishment
Republicans, like Rove and like Barbour?  STEELE: Well, you’ve seen their reactions to various
things, how they -- how they, you know, talk about the RNC and
what we’re doing. We -- we got on a bus and went out to the --
to the country, because that’s where the party needs to be. It
doesn’t need to be stuck here in D.C. talking to each other and
talking amongst itself. It needs to be out there listening to
folks.  That’s why you saw such a rise of grassroots activism, from
Tea Partiers and so forth, over the last year, because political
structures stop listening. The -- you know, the policies that
are coming out of the White House reflect, again, this inability
to -- to -- to hear what people are saying.  So my goal -- and I know Sarah’s goal has been -- let’s
take the party and put it on the streets. Let’s get out there in
the neighborhoods and communities and -- and get candidates who
reflect that. And what you’re about to see, in terms of the
candidates coming to Washington, is very different than -- than
what we saw in 1994, for example, or what we saw from the
Democrats when they sent their Blue Dogs to Congress in 2006.  HUNT: Well, I’m not -- I know you’re not going to endorse a
candidate, and I’m not really asking you to do it. I’m just
trying to get a sense whether you feel kind of a simpatico with
--  STEELE: Oh, absolutely.  HUNT: -- Sarah Palin, as far as --  STEELE: Absolutely.  HUNT: -- as the establishment Republicans --  STEELE: Oh, absolutely. No, I really do. You know, in the
words of Bill Clinton, I feel her pain, you know?  HUNT: Right. Right.  STEELE: But the --  HUNT: And you think the criticism has been unfair of her?  STEELE: I do. I do. I think you cannot -- you cannot sit
there and look at what she’s able to do in terms of galvanizing
our ground game, galvanizing our troops, moving people to
action. That’s a very powerful force in politics.  Barack Obama has that ability. Sarah Palin has that
ability. And I think the establishment in this town just needs
to chill out a little bit. And let’s wait and see what happens
as we go forward. And whatever calls she makes, trust me, will
be in the best interests of our country and the people of this
country.  HUNT: OK, Chairman Steele, thank you so much for being --  STEELE: All right, thank you.  HUNT: -- with us today --  STEELE: Absolutely.  HUNT: - after this historic election.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
