U.S. stock futures rose and
Treasuries declined after government data showed the nation
added more jobs than economists estimated last month, bolstering
optimism that the labor market is recovering.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month climbed 0.2 percent to 1,221 at 8:38 a.m. in New York
after the benchmark gauge rallied to a two-year high yesterday.
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  futures increased 18 points, or 0.2
percent, to 11,405. The 10-year Treasury note’s yield advanced
eight basis points to 2.56 percent.  Payrolls climbed 151,000, exceeding the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and following a revised
41,000 drop the prior month that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed. Private payrolls
that exclude government agencies also gained more than forecast,
while the jobless rate held at 9.6 percent.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 3.2 percent this week, poised for a
fifth straight weekly advance in its longest rally since April,
as the Federal Reserve announced plans to buy $600 billion in
bonds and midterm elections produced a divided Congress that’s
unlikely to pass further business reforms.  The gauge has surged 16 percent since the end of August
amid speculation the central bank will pump more cash into the
economy to combat an unemployment rate that has hovered near 10
percent for more than a year. The index up 19 percent from its
2010 low in July. The advance has left the index  trading  at 15.3
times its companies’ reported earnings, the highest valuation
since the end of June.  Improving  profits  have also helped fuel the rally.
Earnings-per-share have topped estimates at about 77 percent of
the companies in the S&P 500 that have reported since Oct. 7,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income has
increased 32 percent for the group amid 9.8 percent growth in
sales.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
