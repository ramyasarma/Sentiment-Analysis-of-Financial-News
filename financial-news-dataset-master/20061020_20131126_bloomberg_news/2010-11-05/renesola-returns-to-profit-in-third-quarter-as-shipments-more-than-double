ReneSola Ltd. , the Chinese maker of
solar wafers and modules that’s more than doubled in New York

quarter as sales leaped.  Net income was a record $60.1 million compared with a loss
of $10.2 million in the year-earlier period, the Jiashan-based
company said today in a statement. Earnings per share totaled
$0.70 vs a loss of $0.14.  The manufacturer, which makes its own polysilicon, the main
raw material in solar-energy devices, said shipments of wafers
and modules climbed to 324.9 megawatts from 146.9 megawatts a
year earlier.  It raised guidance for fourth-quarter shipments to 310 to
330 megawatts and forecast a 42 percent to 48 percent increase
in full-year shipments in 2011 from 2010.  The company’s American depositary receipts rose to  close 
yeaterday at $13.06 from $4.76 at the start of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
