Ukraine’s state budget missed revenue
and spending targets in the first nine month of the year, more
than doubling the deficit from the year-earlier period, the
country’s audit chamber said.  The shortfall through September was 52.8 billion hryvnia
($6.6 billion), 2.2 times more than in the first three quarters
of 2009, the regulator based in the capital Kiev said in a
 statement  on its website yesterday.  The deficit was financed mainly by state borrowing of 98.6
billion hryvnia in the period, 83.8 percent of the 2010 target,
the report said. Revenue was 67.7 of the full-year target and
spending reached 68.7 percent, it said.  Short and medium-term debt account for 80 percent of
government borrowing, which “will stimulate further borrowing to
refinance the accumulated debt,” the chamber said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
