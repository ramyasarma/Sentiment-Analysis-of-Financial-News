Atlantic City, the biggest East Coast
gambling center, had its credit rating cut three levels by
Moody’s Investors Service out of concern tax appeals by casinos
and out-of-state competition for bettors will hurt revenue.  The downgrade to Baa1 from A1, three levels above
speculative grade, affects $151 million of general-obligation
debt, according to Moody’s, which changed its outlook to
negative. It follows a Nov. 3 decision by Standard & Poor’s to
put a negative outlook on the city’s A rating, sixth-highest.  Atlantic City, a community of about 40,000, finished its
2009 fiscal year Dec. 31 with an $8.1 million deficit, Moody’s
said.  “The city’s negative fund balance position, outstanding
tax casino credits and the significant number of remaining
unsettled casino tax appeals will continue to pressure the
city’s financial position,” Moody’s said in a report dated
yesterday.  Casinos, which Moody’s said account for 74 percent of the
city’s tax base, are owed $17 million in property-tax credits
over the next three years, according to the report. Six of
Atlantic City’s 11 casinos have been through bankruptcy or have
restructured debt in the past year.  The ratings company’s action follows a plan for New Jersey
to assume oversight of the city’s budget and finances for at
least a year under an arrangement between Republican Governor
 Chris Christie  and the city’s mayor. State officials will get a
direct hand in developing the budget and tax rate, according to
an agreement signed Oct. 4.  In return, city officials got permission to raise property
taxes $2.2 million above the limit state law allows. The city
has an annual budget of about $200 million.  The city, on the Atlantic Ocean 62 miles (103 kilometers)
east of Philadelphia, has lost 5,000 casino jobs since 2007 and
has an unemployment rate of 14.3 percent in August, according to
Moody’s. Through September,  casino revenue  was down 8.7 percent
from the first nine months of 2009, according to the state
Casino Control Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
