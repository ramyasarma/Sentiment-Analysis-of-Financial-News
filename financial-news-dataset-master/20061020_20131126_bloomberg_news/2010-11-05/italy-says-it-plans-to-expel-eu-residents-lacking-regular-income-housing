Italy’s government will begin
expelling European Union residents who refuse orders to leave
the country issued because they lack a job, income or housing,
Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said.  EU legislation from 2004 requires EU citizens living
outside their home nation within the 27-member bloc to have an
income and housing, though the law doesn’t sanction those who
violate it, Maroni said. Italy’s measure will penalize those who
break the law, he told a briefing in Rome today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
