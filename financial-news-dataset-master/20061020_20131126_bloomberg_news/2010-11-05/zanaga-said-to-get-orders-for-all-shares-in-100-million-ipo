Zanaga Iron Ore Co., a mining company
with operations in the Republic of Congo, has received orders
for all the stock available in its $100 million initial public
offering in London, said two people familiar with the matter.  The company has enough orders for the sale before its
management start meeting investors next week, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the information isn’t
public. Zanaga is slated to join London’s Alternative Investment
Market on Nov. 18, according to a statement on the Regulatory
News Service on Nov. 3.  Liberum Capital Ltd. is managing the offering. A spokesman
for Liberum Capital in London wasn’t immediately available to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg. A call made to Zanaga’s
registered office in the British Virgin Islands wasn’t answered.  Xstrata Plc , the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal,
agreed to pay as much as $106 million to fund a pre-feasibility
study of the Zanaga iron-ore project in the Republic of Congo.
Once the study is finished in the first quarter of 2011, Xstrata
will decide whether to exercise an option to buy 50 percent plus
one share in the project, Zanaga said Nov. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
