An airplane chartered by  Eni SpA ,
Italy’s biggest oil and natural gas company, crashed soon after
takeoff in Karachi, Pakistan today, killing all 21 onboard.  The pilot was trying to return to the airport after the
plane developed an engine fault,  Pervez George , a spokesman for
Pakistan’s civil aviation authority, said by phone. Marianna
Croning, a spokeswoman in Eni’s Karachi office, confirmed the
company hired the aircraft without giving further details.  The twin-engine Beech Aircraft was destined for the Bhit
gas field in the Jamshoro district of Sindh province, Eni said
in a press release posted on its  website . Those aboard included
three crew, one airport security employee, 15 Eni staff and two
contract workers, according to the statement. Of Eni’s staff,
one was Italian while the rest were all from Pakistan.  Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  and Claudio
Descalzi, who heads exploration and production, will fly to
Pakistan in the next few hours, the company said.  There were no survivors, Noor Alam, an army spokesman, told
reporters at the airport. Javaid ul Hag, an official at  JS Air ,
which owned the plane, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
