House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  said she
will run for minority leader after elections that saw her party
lose at least 60 seats and the Republicans pick up control of
the chamber.  “Our work is far from finished,” Pelosi said in a letter
to all House Democrats. “As a result of Tuesday’s election, the
role of Democrats in the 112th Congress will change, but our
commitment to serving the American people will not.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
