Electricite de  France SA , the world’s
biggest operator of atomic reactors, said its nuclear plants
will have more and longer halts in 2011 than this year as six
reactors will undergo once-a-decade inspections.  The halts are a regulatory obligation and could take as
long as 100 days compared with typical 30- to 45-day reactor
halts for refueling and maintenance,  Philippe Torrion , Paris-
based EDF’s head of optimization and trading, said today at a
press conference.  The extended maintenance, starting in February, will allow
the reactors to operate for another decade, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
