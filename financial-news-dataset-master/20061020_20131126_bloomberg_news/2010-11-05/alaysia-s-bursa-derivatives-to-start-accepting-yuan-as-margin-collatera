Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad,
which sets the global benchmark for crude palm oil, will start
accepting Chinese yuan as margin collateral for trading in the
Malaysian derivatives market, Yusli Mohamed Yusoff, chief
executive officer of the bourse, said today.  “This move signifies the importance of China traders
participating in our market,” Yusli said at a contract-signing
ceremony with the Dalian Commodity Exchange in Guangzhou today.
“Hence we have made the Malaysian futures market appealing and
accessible, via accepting the Chinese currency RMB as margin
deposit.”  The measure will begin this month, Ong Kheng Kok, manager
of clearing and settlement, said in interview without
elaborating.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
