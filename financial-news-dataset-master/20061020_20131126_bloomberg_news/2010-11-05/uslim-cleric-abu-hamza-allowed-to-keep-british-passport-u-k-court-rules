Abu Hamza al-Masri , an Islamic cleric
jailed for inciting murder and racial hatred, can keep his
British passport because without it he would be stateless, a
U.K. court ruled.  Hamza, who was born in Egypt and granted British
citizenship in 1986, said he no longer has Egyptian citizenship,
according to  the judgment  today from a London immigration
tribunal. The cleric is currently being held at a British prison
awaiting possible extradition to the U.S.  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  is “disappointed, in one
word” with the ruling, his spokeswoman,  Vickie Sheriff , told
reporters in London.  The U.S. is seeking to prosecute Hamza on charges he
supported the Taliban with money and troops, set up a terrorist
training camp in Oregon and aided in a 1998 Yemeni kidnapping
plot that left four dead. The extradition to the U.S. was
delayed in July by the  European Court of Human Rights .  The court said Hamza and three other men shouldn’t be
extradited until it reaches a decision on his claim the maximum
security prison in the U.S. where he is likely to be jailed
would violate European human rights rules that prohibit torture
and degradation. The court said it needs more time to rule on
the issue.  The U.K. approved Hamza’s extradition after the U.S. gave
diplomatic assurances the cleric’s human rights would be
respected. Hamza had appealed both the lower court decision to
allow his extradition and the U.K. government’s signing of the
extradition papers.  To contact the reporter for this story:  Lindsay Fortado  in
