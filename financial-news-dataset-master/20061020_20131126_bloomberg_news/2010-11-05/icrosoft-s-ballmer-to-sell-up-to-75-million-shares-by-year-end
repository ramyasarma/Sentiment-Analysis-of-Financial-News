Microsoft Corp.  Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Ballmer  plans to sell as much as $2 billion in
stock to diversify his holdings and help with tax planning
before the end of the year.  The transaction would mark his first stock sale in seven
years, the Redmond, Washington-based company said today on its
 website . Ballmer held about 408 million shares before the move,
which involves as many as 75 million shares, Microsoft said. At
the stock’s closing price on Nov. 5, the transaction would
amount to $2 billion.  “Even though this is a personal financial matter, I want to
be clear about this to avoid any confusion,” Ballmer said in the
statement. “I am excited about our new products and the
potential for our technology to change people’s lives, and I
remain fully committed to Microsoft and its success.”  Ballmer’s sale comes as the company steps up its use of
dividends and buybacks to reward shareholders, who have seen the
stock fall this year. Microsoft, the biggest software maker,
boosted its dividend 23 percent in September. As of June, the
company had approval to buy back $23.7 billion shares.  Microsoft fell 29 cents to $26.85 today in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The  shares  have declined 12 percent this year.  Ballmer, 54, has already sold about 50 million shares of
the total 75 million, according to a regulatory filing. He took
over from  Bill Gates  as CEO in 2000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
