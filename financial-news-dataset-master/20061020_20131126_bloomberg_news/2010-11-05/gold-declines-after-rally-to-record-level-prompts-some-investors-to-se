Gold declined in London after a rally
to a record and a rebounding dollar prompted some investors to
sell bullion. Silver was little changed after reaching a 30-year
high and palladium fell from a nine-year high.  Gold climbed to a record $1,394.41 an ounce earlier today.
The dollar yesterday slid to a nine-month low against the euro
after the Federal Reserve this week said it will buy an
additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June to spur
growth. Gold, which usually moves inversely to the greenback,
yesterday rose the most since January 2009.  “It’s not surprising that after a rally to a new record
high, some profit-taking will set in,”  Peter Fertig , owner of
Quantitative Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg, Germany, said
today by phone. “I expect the U.S. dollar to remain under
pressure” in the medium-term, and that will support gold
prices, he said.  Immediate-delivery bullion lost $8.55, or 0.6 percent, to
$1,383.95 an ounce at 12 p.m. in London. Prices gained 3.3
percent yesterday. The metal for December delivery was 0.1
percent higher at $1,384 on the Comex in New York, after today
reaching a record $1,394.40.  Bullion rose to $1,384.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,381 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. The dollar
gained as much as 0.9 percent against the euro today.  “Traders will be looking to the currencies for direction
in the coming sessions,”  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in a report.  Winning Streak  Gold is up 26 percent this year and is heading for a 10th
annual gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in
London, partly on demand for an alternative asset to protect
against the debasement of currencies. Precious metals have
outperformed global equities, Treasuries and most industrial
metals this year as central banks maintained low interest rates
and governments spent trillions of dollars to spur growth.  The Fed on Nov. 3 said its purchases will be about $75
billion a month and pledged to keep the benchmark interest rate
close to zero for an “extended period.” The central bank will
also reinvest as much as $300 billion in proceeds from agency
and mortgage debt it holds.  “It’s probably because traders are taking profit from
what’s been a very strong run” for gold, David Lennox, a
resource analyst with Fat Prophets, said from Sydney. “There’s
been really no change in the fundamental factors that should
impact on gold.”  Ten of 15 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 67 percent, said the metal will rise next week.
Four forecast lower prices and one was neutral.  Gold Assets  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products added 0.25 metric
ton to 2,085.85 tons yesterday, the first gain in 15 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.
Holdings reached a record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.  Silver for immediate delivery in London earlier today
reached $26.65 an ounce, the highest price since March 1980, and
was last down 0.2 percent at $26.23. Prices are up 55 percent
this year. Silver reached an all-time high of $50.35 in New York
in 1980, a year after the Hunt brothers tried to corner the
market.  “There’s more room for silver to advance further as it
looks relatively undervalued in comparison with gold,” said
 Chris Yoo , head of global derivatives at Samsung Futures Inc. in
Seoul. “Also, silver demand for industrial uses normally
increases towards year-end.”  An ounce of gold bought as little as 52.2396 ounces of
silver in London today, the smallest amount since August 2008,
before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. triggered
the worst recession since World War II.  Palladium was 1 percent lower at $675.50 an ounce, after
reaching $688, the highest price since April 2001. It’s up 67
percent this year. Platinum declined 1.7 percent to $1,754.50 an
ounce. Prices yesterday reached $1,797.50, the highest level
since July 2008. Both metals are used mostly to make jewelry and
pollution-control devices for cars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
