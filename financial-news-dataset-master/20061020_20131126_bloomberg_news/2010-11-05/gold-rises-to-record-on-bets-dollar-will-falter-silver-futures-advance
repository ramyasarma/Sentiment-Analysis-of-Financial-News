Gold rose to a record on bets the
Federal Reserve’s stimulus plan to bolster the U.S. economy will
erode the value of the dollar, boosting demand for precious
metals as alternative assets.  Gold futures reached $1,398.70 an ounce as the greenback
headed for the second straight weekly decline against a basket
of six major currencies. Silver extended a rally to a 30-year
high. The Fed said on Nov. 3 it would buy $600 billion in
Treasuries through June to spur growth.  “Markets are realizing the impact of quantitative easing
is a tremendous weakening of the dollar,” said  Frank McGhee ,
the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.
“Ultimately, the Fed is slugging it out to make our currency as
cheap as possible. That’s extremely bullish for gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $14.60, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $1,397.70 at 1:33 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, capping a 3 percent gain for this week. It was also the
highest settlement ever. The metal has rallied 28 percent this
year, heading for the 10th straight annual gain.  Gold for immediate delivery advanced to a record $1,398.27.  The Fed’s benchmark lending rate has been zero percent to
0.25 percent since December 2008. Before the latest stimulus
announcement, the central bank purchased $1.7 trillion in
mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries.  “Gold prices may simply continue rising until Fed policy
is normalized,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global
Holdings Inc. in Chicago. “Eventually, gold will begin to lose
out to risk markets like stocks as the prospect of easing
decreases.”  $1,650 Forecast  Gold may reach $1,650 in the next 12 months, analysts at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report today.  The Fed’s “return to quantitative easing and the movement
of gold prices to these new record highs could spark renewed
investor demand for gold, which has been remarkably subdued in
recent months,” the analysts said. “This represents upside
risk to both our forecasts and to gold prices.”  Holdings  in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded product backed by bullion, have not posted a gain since
Oct. 14. They have increased 14 percent this year.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 70.5 cents, or
2.7 percent, to $26.748 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached
$26.915, the highest level for a most-active contract since

in 2010.  Palladium futures for December delivery gained $10.65, or
1.6 percent, to $685.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The metal climbed 6.2 percent this week, the eighth
straight gain and longest rally since the end of October 2005.  Platinum futures for January delivery climbed $13, or 0.7

week. Platinum is up 20 percent this year while palladium has
