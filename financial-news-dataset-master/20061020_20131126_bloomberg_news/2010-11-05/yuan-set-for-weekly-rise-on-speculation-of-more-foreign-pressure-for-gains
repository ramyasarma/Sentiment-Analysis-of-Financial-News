The yuan had its first weekly gain in
three weeks on speculation foreign governments, notably the U.S.,
will step up calls for the currency to appreciate when leaders
from the Group of 20 nations meet next week in Seoul.  The yuan advanced 0.29 percent in the past two days after
the Federal Reserve said Nov. 3 it will buy an additional $600
billion of Treasuries through June, expanding record stimulus
that has helped spur a flow of funds into economies offering
faster growth and higher returns. The People’s Bank of China set
the reference rate for yuan trading at 6.6610 per dollar today,
the strongest level since Oct. 19.  “Overseas pressure on the yuan will increase during the G-
20 meeting,” said  Liu Dongliang , a Shenzhen-based analyst at
China Merchants Bank Co., the country’s sixth-largest lender by
market value. “The Fed’s quantitative easing measures will also
add to the pressure.”  The yuan rose 0.21 percent this week to 6.6638 per dollar
as of 5:30 p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency, which rose 0.10 percent
today, has strengthened by 2.5 percent since China ended a two-
year peg to the dollar on June 19.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.32 percent
in the week to 6.4400 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency
will strengthen 3.4 percent in a year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts weakened by 0.31 percent
today.  Chinese central bank adviser  Li Daokui  said yesterday
there’s “no doubt” that U.S. monetary easing will increase
pressure for the yuan to appreciate because of the
“considerable amount” of foreign capital that will flow into
China. Still, he said, there’s no need to panic, because of the
size of China’s economy.  Bonds Decline  Government bonds declined on speculation China may seek
tightening measures to contain price gains.  Consumer prices  climbed 4 percent in October, the fastest
pace in two years, from 3.6 percent in the previous month,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of 25 analysts before the
official announcement on Nov. 11.  “Speculation about another hike in interest rates or
reserve requirement ratio is prompting traders to cut
positions,” said  Tang Guohui , a bond trader at Industrial
Securities Co. in Shanghai.  The yield on the 3.43 percent treasury note due February
2020 gained two basis points to 3.84 percent, and the price of
the security dropped 0.13 to 96.87 per 100 yuan face amount,
according to the Interbank Bond Market. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  Dirk Beveridge   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
