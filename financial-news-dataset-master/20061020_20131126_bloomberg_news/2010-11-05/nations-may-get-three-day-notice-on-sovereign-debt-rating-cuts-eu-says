Credit ratings companies may be
forced to give governments three-days’ notice of any change to
their sovereign-debt rating, under European Union proposals.  Extending the warning period to 72 hours, from the current
12 hours, would give countries a chance to point out “factual
errors” and “new developments” which may influence the
rating, the  European Commission  said in a report on possible
rules for credit ratings companies published today.  “Sovereign-debt ratings play a crucial role for the rated
countries, since a downgrading has the immediate effect of
making a country’s borrowing more expensive,” the Brussels-
based EU executive said.  The commission began considering tougher rules after
Greece’s rating was cut to junk status in April. The cut added
urgency to EU plans to bail out the debt-plagued nation. The
 Financial Stability Board , a group of global regulators, said
last week that the dependence of banks and investors on credit
ratings companies should be curbed because it poses a danger to
financial stability.  To contact the reporters on this story:
