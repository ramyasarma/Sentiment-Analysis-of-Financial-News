American Tower Corp. , a Boston-based
operator of mobile-phone towers, has agreed to buy as many as
3,200 towers from Cell C Ltd., South Africa’s third-largest
mobile-phone company, for about $430 million.  South Africa is a “compelling investment opportunity” for
American Tower,  Jim Taiclet , the company’s chief executive
officer, said in a statement today. The deal provides a platform
for “our future growth in the region.”  American Tower will buy 1,400 of Cell C’s existing towers
and as many as 1,800 additional towers that are already being
built or will be constructed over the next two to three years,
the companies said in the statement. Johannesburg-based  Cell C 
will be the “anchor tenant” for each tower and the transaction
is expected to close early next year.  The transaction lets Cell C “realize the value embedded in
our passive infrastructure,” said CEO  Lars Reichelt . The
relationship will enable Cell C to enhance the quality and
coverage of its network, he said.  Cell C trails  Vodacom Group Ltd.  and  MTN Group Ltd. ,
respectively the country’s largest and second-largest providers
of mobile-phone services to South Africans.
