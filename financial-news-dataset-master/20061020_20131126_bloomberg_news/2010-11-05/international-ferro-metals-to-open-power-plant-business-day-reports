International Ferro Metals Ltd. will
in four weeks start up a co-generation plant that will use waste
gases at its ferrochrome smelter in South Africa to generate 17
megawatts of power, Johannesburg’s Business Day reported, citing
AAP Carbon, the project’s developer.   The plant will meet 12 percent of the smelter’s electricity
needs, will cut carbon dioxide emissions by 160,000 metric tons
a year and has cost 300 million rand ($44 million) to build, the
newspaper said, citing Alex Berger, the chief executive officer
of AAP Carbon.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
