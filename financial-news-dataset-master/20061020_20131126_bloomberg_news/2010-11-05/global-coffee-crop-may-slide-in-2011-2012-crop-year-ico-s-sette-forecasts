World coffee output may slide next
season as stockpiles hover near a record low because of a
smaller harvest in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer, the
International Coffee Organization said.  Global output in the 2011 crop year may fall from between
133 million and 135 million bags in the current season,  ICO 
Executive Director  Jose Sette , 55, said yesterday in an
interview. He declined to give a specific forecast.  “Brazil is such a big chunk that unless there is something
unexpected in the other countries, inevitably the next crop year
has to be smaller,” Sette, 55, said in Cartagena, Colombia.  Coffee has surged 51 percent this year and touched a 13-
year high in New York yesterday, as above-average rainfall in
Central America and Colombia hurt harvests. Brazil may harvest
36 million bags of coffee next year, down from 47.2 million this
year and 39.5 million in 2009,  Gilson Ximenes , the head of the
National Coffee Council, said in an interview on Oct. 22.  Coffee stockpiles in producing nations dropped to about 12
million bags this year, the lowest since the London-based ICO
began keeping records in the 1960s, Sette said. Each bag weighs
60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  “If we do have a significant production problem, then we
don’t have a cushion,” Sette said. “It would lead to sky-high
prices.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery gained 9.65 cents, or
4.9 percent, to settle at $2.058 a pound yesterday on ICE
Futures U.S. The price rose as high as $2.0925, the highest
level since August 1997.  Coffee Demand  Global coffee consumption may rise this year and next,
Sette said. Last year, demand slid to 129.1 million bags from
130.6 million bags in 2008, according to ICO figures.  Output by Vietnam, the world’s second-largest coffee
producer, may rise this season, even as above-average rainfall
threatens to delay crops, he said. Above-average rainfall in
some countries and drought in others are signs that climate
change will keep affecting global crops, Sette said.  Brazil’s April-to-March crop year overlaps with countries
that have crop years running from October to September. The
overlap means that the ICO is including Brazilian output from
the current harvest that will finish this year with countries
that will complete their harvests next year. Brazil’s coffee
harvest runs from around April to October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
