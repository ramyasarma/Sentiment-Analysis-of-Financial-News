A  Foxconn Technology Group  worker in
China died from a fall today, months after a spate of similar
fatalities at the electronics maker, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported  No further information was immediately available, Xinhua
said, citing the Shenzhen municipal government.  Foxconn, which makes electronics for customers ranging from
 Apple Inc.  to  Hewlett-Packard Co. , doubled wages for its
production workers and installed nets around dormitories in
Shenzhen after at least 10 Chinese workers committed suicide
this year. The last confirmed death was in August.  The deaths prompted labor groups including China Labor
Watch to say the company is running a sweatshop that pushes
employees to work long hours to earn more money. Foxconn has
denied the allegation.  Edmund Ding , a spokesman for Taiwan’s Foxconn, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
