JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its
average 2011 forecast for Brent crude to $91.75 from $84.50 a
barrel, following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announcement of
additional asset purchases, or quantitative easing.  “Although there has already been a significant currency
and commodity price shift in anticipation of QE2, we believe
there remains a strong likelihood of further dollar weakness,
which will prove supportive to the oil price,” analysts at
JPMorgan led by Lawrence Eagles in New York said in a note dated
yesterday.  The price of West Texas Intermediate crude will remain $2 a
barrel below Brent, the analysts said, raising their 2011 WTI
forecast to $89.75 a barrel from $82.50. JPMorgan raised its
fourth-quarter 2010 estimates to $88 a barrel from $83 a barrel
for Brent, and to $86 from $81 for WTI.  The forecasts for Brent “implicitly target a spike to $100
over the next six months,” according to the report.  “But it is important to remember that OECD economies
remain fragile, and should the oil price spike too high, too
quickly, that could have a circular impact in terms of global
GDP growth and oil demand,” the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
