Corn futures fell as U.S. farmers
increased sales after prices rallied yesterday a 26-month high.  Before today, cash  prices  in north central Iowa, the
biggest U.S. state producer, surged 66 percent since the end of
June after adverse weather reduced production, data from the
nation’s Department of Agriculture show. The agency will update
its crop projection on Nov. 9. The U.S. is the world’s biggest
producer and exporter.  “Farmers increased sales yesterday on the rally,” said
 Dan Basse , the president of AgResource Co. in Chicago. “Traders
are stepping aside to wait on new USDA forecasts next week.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 2.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $5.8775 a bushel as of 2:35 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the first drop in three days. Yesterday,
the price reached $5.9575, the highest level for the most-active
contract since August 2008.  Earlier, the price rose as much as 0.3 percent on mounting
speculation that the crop in the U.S. will be smaller than the
government forecast last month, Basse said. The price ended the
week up 1 percent, the second straight advance and the fourth in
five weeks.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
