Wheat fell in Chicago on speculation
that production in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, will
compensate for crop losses in other countries. Prices also
dropped as the dollar strengthened.  U.S. farmers will produce 2.22 million bushels of wheat in
the marketing year ending May 31, up 0.3 percent from a year
earlier, the Department of Agriculture said in a report on Oct.
8. While growers in the U.S. will plant 9.5 percent less wheat
this year, yields will improve, the government said. The grain
has dropped 1 percent this week.  “As speculators are losing interest and the latest data on
the coming crop are looking good, I wouldn’t be surprised of a
drop,” Jonathan Bouchet, a Geneva-based trader at OTCex Group,
said in an e-mailed report. “It is time now to see if it is
overpriced and see if people are looking to pay higher.”  Wheat for December delivery declined 3.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $7.1025 a bushel at 11:42 a.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have surged 48 percent since the
end of June after drought destroyed Russian crops and wet
weather this year prevented planting of Canadian grain.  Canada was the second-biggest exporter of the grain last
year, followed by Russia and Australia, USDA data show.  January-delivery milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 0.9 percent to 217.50 euros ($307.07) a metric ton.  Stronger Dollar  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, gained as much as 0.7 percent. A stronger
dollar makes U.S. crops more expensive for importers and saps
demand for commodities as an alternative investment.  Corn slid on speculation dry weather will allow farmers in
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter of the grain, to finish
harvesting ahead of schedule.  The U.S. corn crop was 91 percent collected as of Oct. 31,
up from 24 percent at the same time last year and ahead of the
five-year average of 61 percent, the USDA said in a report
earlier this week. The price has gained 18 percent since the end
of September, partly on speculation U.S. production would
decline more than expected.  Corn for March delivery dropped 5.5 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $5.9825 a bushel in Chicago. Prices have gained 0.5 percent
this week and 22 percent in the past month on speculation that
U.S. production would fall.  Soybeans for January delivery added 1.25 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $12.76 a bushel. The oilseed is set for a fifth
weekly gain, the longest streak since a six-week run through
June 5, 2009.  Rough rice for January delivery lost 16.5 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $14.695 per 100 pounds, paring a three-day climb of
4.5 percent. The grain has slipped 0.2 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
