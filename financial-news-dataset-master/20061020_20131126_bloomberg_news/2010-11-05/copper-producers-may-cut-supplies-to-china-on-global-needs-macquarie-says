Copper producers may reduce supplies
of the metal to China next year because of growing demand in
other countries, Macquarie Group Ltd. said.  Smelters in Japan will cut their supply into China by as
much as 50 percent from this year, Macquarie analyst Bonnie Liu
wrote in a report dated today. South American producers may also
seek to reduce their dependence on China next year and divert
more supplies to Europe, she wrote.  “We hear some producers are going to cut their refined
metal supply into China by 15-20% next year,” she wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
