U.K. stocks climbed after payrolls in
the U.S. rose more than forecast in October.  The FTSE 100 Index advanced 0.3 percent to 5,878.99 at
12:34 p.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.5
percent.  The Labor Department report showed payrolls climbed
151,000, beating the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The figures followed a revised 41,000 drop the
prior month that was smaller than initially estimated.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
