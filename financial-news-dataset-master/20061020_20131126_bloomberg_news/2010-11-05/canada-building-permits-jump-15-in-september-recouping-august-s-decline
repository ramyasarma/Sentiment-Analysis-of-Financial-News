Canadian  building permits  jumped 15.3
percent in September, rebounding from a decline in August, led
by single-family houses and offices.  The total value of permits issued by municipalities
increased to C$6.61 billion ($6.57 billion), Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa. Economists predicted a 2.5 percent advance
based on the median of 15 responses to a Bloomberg News survey.  Canada has recovered all the jobs lost during a recession
that ended last year, and five-year fixed mortgage rates are
close to the lowest in half a century. Municipalities are facing
a March 31 deadline to complete projects receiving federal
government stimulus funding.  Permits for non-residential construction  rose 26.7 percent
to C$2.75 billion in September after dropping 24.2 percent in
August.  Commercial projects rose 37.8 percent on increased office
space in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, and institutional
buildings rose 23.4 percent on medical and religious projects.  Residential permits increased 8.3 percent to C$3.86
billion, Statistics Canada said. Single-family permits rose 9.5
percent to C$2.23 billion after five previous declines and
multiple-unit structures advanced 6.7 percent to C$1.63 billion.  The total value of building permits for September was 23.9
percent higher than the year-ago month, the report said.  Statistics Canada also revised its estimate for the August
decline in building permits to 9.5 percent from the originally
reported 9.2 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
