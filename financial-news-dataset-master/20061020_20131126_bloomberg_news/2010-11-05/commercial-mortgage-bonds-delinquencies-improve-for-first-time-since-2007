Late payments on U.S. commercial
property mortgages bundled and sold as bonds declined in October
for the first time in three years as seven loans were resolved,
Fitch Ratings said.  The delinquency rate fell 88 basis points from a month
earlier, or 0.88 percentage point, to 7.78 percent, Fitch said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The drop came mostly from the resolution of seven loans of
more than $100 million, including $4.1 billion from Extended
Stay America Inc., the hotel operator that emerged from
bankruptcy last month. An expected rise in delinquencies over
the next two years may be counterbalanced at times by large-loan
resolutions, said  Harris Trifon , a Deutsche Bank analyst in New
York.  “It’s going to be more volatile, much more so than what
it’s been,” Trifon said in a telephone interview. Loans that
are considered resolved include those where the borrowers resume
paying, the debt is paid off or terms are adjusted.  Hotel delinquencies fell to 14.1 percent from 21.3 percent,
the biggest decline on record for any commercial mortgage-bond
sector, Fitch said.  “Hotel loans are now the most well-positioned to recover
quickly when business and consumer spending resume and the
economic recovery gains traction,”  Mary MacNeill , a managing
director at Fitch in New York, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
