HSBC Holdings Plc  abandoned its two-
month bid to buy  Nedbank Group Ltd. , the South African lender
controlled by Old Mutual Plc, after deciding it didn’t meet its
targets.  “We did a lot of work and then appraised the opportunity
against the business case that we constructed,” Finance
Director  Douglas Flint  said on a conference call in London
today. “We were disappointed that we concluded that it wasn’t
something that we felt we could go forward with.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
