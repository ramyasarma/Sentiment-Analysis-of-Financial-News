Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
President Charles Plosser said it may take at least 50 years to
understand the financial crisis and whether the central bank
responded with the right actions.  “It will be at least 50 years before we really understand
very well what happened in 2008-2009, and we will be
interpreting for another 50 years as to whether the Federal
Reserve undertook the right policies or the wrong policies,”
Plosser said today during an audience discussion at a Fed
conference in Jekyll Island, Georgia.  Citing continuing debate about the Great Depression seven
decades later, Plosser said that “humility is in order” for
policy makers on their ability to make decisions and later
understand whether they got it right.  “I have no doubt that at the end of the crisis of 2008-
2009 the Federal Reserve will pat itself on the back for a job
well done,” Plosser said, referring to a conference speaker,
Columbia University Professor  Charles Calomiris , who said
central bankers patted themselves on the back after the
Depression. “There’s a lot of history left to be written.”  Plosser, 62, the Philadelphia Fed president since 2006,
said Sept. 29 that he opposed further large-scale asset
purchases. On Nov. 3 the Fed decided to buy $600 billion of
Treasuries in an expansion of record stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
