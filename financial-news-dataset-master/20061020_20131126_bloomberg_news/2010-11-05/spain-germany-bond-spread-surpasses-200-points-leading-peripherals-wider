The extra yield investors demand to
hold Spanish 10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity German
securities surpassed 200 basis points, leading spread widening
among so-called peripheral bond markets in Europe.  The Spanish spread was nine basis points higher at 204
basis points as of 8:53 a.m. in London, the most since July 14,
based on closing generic prices.  The Irish spread widened four basis points to a record 530
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
