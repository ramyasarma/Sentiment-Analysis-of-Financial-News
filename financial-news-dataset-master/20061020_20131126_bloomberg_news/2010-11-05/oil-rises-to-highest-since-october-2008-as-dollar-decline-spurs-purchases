Crude oil surged to its highest level
in two years as U.S. payrolls rose more than forecast in
October, a sign the economy is recovering, and the dollar headed
for a weekly decline against most major currencies.  Oil capped its best week since February as payrolls gained
and the jobless rate held at 9.6 percent. The  Dollar Index ,
which tracks the currency against six others, was poised to drop
0.9 percent this week, the most in four weeks, after the Federal
Reserve announced $600 billion in stimulus measures Nov. 3.  The jobs number is “very supportive” for energy markets,
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-
based hedge fund focusing on energy. “If unemployment figures
start to improve, you’ll start to see gasoline demand pick up
and refineries boosting runs.”  Oil for December delivery gained 36 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $86.85 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest settlement price since Oct. 8, 2008. Crude
rallied 6.7 percent this week and has advanced 9.1 percent in
the past year.  Brent crude for December settlement rose 11 cents to $88.11
a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Payrolls climbed 151,000, exceeding the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and following a revised
41,000 drop the prior month that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.  The Dollar Index rose 0.9 percent to 76.556 at 3:21 p.m. in
New York. Yesterday, it reached the lowest level since December.
The currency’s gains today were the first since the Federal
Reserve announced $600 billion in stimulus measures.  Relative Strength  Crude’s relative strength index, a measure of how rapidly
prices advance or drop in a specific period, signals that the
rally may be close to dissipating. The 14-day RSI was at 68.14
at 3:50 p.m. A reading of 70 and above is often interpreted as a
sign that prices are “overbought” and ready to decline.  Expectations for gains in crude have increased on
speculation the Fed’s stimulus program will weaken the U.S.
currency as economic growth accelerates, boosting the allure of
raw materials, which are priced in dollars.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its average 2011 forecast for
New York-traded crude to $89.75 a barrel from $82.50, following
the Fed’s announcement of additional asset purchases, or
quantitative easing.  Prices may climb to $100 or more next year for the first
time since the 2008 financial crisis as central banks pump cash
into economies to revive growth, JPMorgan and Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said this week.  OPEC Forecast  Saudi Arabia’s Oil Minister  Ali Al-Naimi  said on Nov. 1
that a range between $70 and $90 a barrel is satisfactory for
consumers. The kingdom had previously indicated a preferred
target of $75 a barrel.  “Quantitative easing and the comments from the Saudi oil
minister were definitely the game-changers,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research at Commerzbank AG.  OPEC is happy with prices between $70 and $85, though an
increase to $90 wouldn’t impede economic growth, OPEC Secretary-
General  Abdulla El-Badri  said yesterday at a press conference in
Vienna. The group doesn’t see prices rising to $100 next year,
he said.  Crude may still increase next week on the dollar’s
weakness, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Twenty-nine of 49
analysts and traders, or 59 percent, said oil will rise through
Nov. 12. Thirteen respondents, or 27 percent, predicted prices
will fall and seven estimate there would be little change. Last
week, 54 percent of respondents said futures would decline.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 495,977
contracts as of 3:21 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 654,393
contracts yesterday, 6.6 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.52 million contracts, the
highest level since November 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
