What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade as bets mount that surging prices
in China will bolster prospects for U.S. exports, said  Jeff Thompson , a grain broker at ABN Amro Clearing LLC in Chicago
said. Soybean-meal futures may open little changed, and soybean
oil is expected to open up 0.6 cent to 0.7 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called 3 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower as
sales by farmers increase following yesterday’s rally to a two-
year high, Thompson said.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as the dollar’s rebound reduces investment
demand, Thompson said. Beneficial weather also may improve the
outlook for winter crops, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
