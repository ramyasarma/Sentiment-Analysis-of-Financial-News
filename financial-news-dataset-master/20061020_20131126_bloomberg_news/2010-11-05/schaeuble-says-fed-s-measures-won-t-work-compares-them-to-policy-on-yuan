German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  criticized the U.S. Federal Reserve’s efforts to
revive growth through bond purchases, comparing it to China’s
restrictions on its currency.  Schaeuble said he was “dumbfounded” at the Fed’s
injection of $600 billion, which he said won’t address the
problem of weakening growth. The finance minister said the
measures will contribute to imbalances by driving down the
currency, similar to measures by China that critics say keep the
yuan artificially low to benefit its exporters.  “The instruments are different but the goal is the same,”
Schaeuble said in a speech today in Berlin. A liquidity shortage
isn’t the  problem and “now to say let’s add another $600
billion won’t solve the problem,” Schaeuble said.  He also rejected U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner ’s proposal to end a currency conflict by putting in
place targets to shrink current-account gaps. Geithner may use a
meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum counterparts
in Kyoto, Japan, to press his case for current-account target.  “It’s our problem as well if the U.S. is no longer certain
-- with the feeling that the old recipes don’t work anymore,”
Schaeuble said. “We don’t have the least reason for
schadenfreude, rather we only have reason to be worried.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
