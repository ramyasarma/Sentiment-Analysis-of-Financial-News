Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s largest maker of luxury vehicles, said it will invest
530 million euros ($751 million) to set up production of its
Megacity electric-powered city car.  The investments, including a new carbon-fiber factory in
the U.S. and a 400 million-euro expansion of its Leipzig,
Germany, auto plant, will create more than 1,000  jobs , the
Munich-based company said today in a statement.  “With this vehicle, we are revolutionizing automobile
manufacturing,” Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer  said
today at an event at the eastern German plant.  The Leipzig factory, which assembles BMW’s 1-Series compact
car and X1 sport-utility vehicle, builds as many as 730 vehicles
daily.  BMW  will create 800 jobs at the eastern German site as it
adds production of the Megacity model designed for urban
driving. The car, BMW’s first battery-powered auto, will be sold
under a new sub-brand when it reaches showrooms in 2013.  Reithofer is developing the Megacity to help meet tighter
environmental regulations and expand the product lineup to boost
sales to 2 million vehicles by 2020 from 1.4 million this year.
Passengers in the four-seat car will be protected by a carbon-
fiber safety cell, similar to a Formula 1 race car.  BMW  is using carbon fiber, which is 50 percent lighter than
steel, to reduce weight and enable a smaller, less costly
battery to power the vehicle. BMW and  SGL Carbon SE , the world’s
biggest manufacturer of carbon and graphite products, are
building a $100 million factory in Moses Lake, Washington, to
make the material for the Megacity models.  To contact the reporter on this story:
