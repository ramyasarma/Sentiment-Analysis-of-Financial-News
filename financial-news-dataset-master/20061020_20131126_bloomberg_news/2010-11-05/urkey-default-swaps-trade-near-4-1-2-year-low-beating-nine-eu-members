Credit-default swaps on Turkish
government debt traded near a 4 1/2-year low, beating nine
European Union members including higher-rated Belgium, as the
Federal Reserve’s latest stimulus plan fueled a rally in
emerging markets.  Turkish swaps were at 118.5 as of 10:12 a.m. in London
today, after falling 10 basis points to 117.82 yesterday, the
lowest closing price since March 2006, according to data
provider CMA. That compares with a high of 829 basis points on
Oct. 23, 2008, during the global credit crisis, and a 2010 peak
of 225 on May 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The contracts for Turkey slid below those of higher-rated
Belgium this week, according to Bloomberg data. Belgium default
swaps were at 128 basis points today, according to CMA. The
contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a debtor doesn’t
adhere to its agreements.  The  ISE National 100 Index  of stocks rose 0.2 percent to
71,049.41 as of 1:38 p.m. in Istanbul, compared with a record of
71,006.82 reached Oct. 22.  Turkey’s sovereign balance sheet “looks stellar,”  Timothy Ash , head of emerging-market research at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in London, wrote in an e-mail. “Turkey is proving to
be a vibrant, dynamic economy, and unemployment is actually
falling as the economy is creating jobs.”  Moody’s Rating  The country’s unemployment rate fell to 10.6 percent in
July from 12.8 percent a year earlier as the economy grew about
11 percent annually in the first half of 2010, rivaling China
for the fastest expansion in the Group of 20 economies. The
country’s sovereign debt rating of Ba2 at Moody’s Investors
Service is 10 steps lower than that of Belgium, which is ranked
at Aa1, the second-highest grade.  Belgium has increasingly been compared with so-called EU
peripheral nations such as Greece, Ireland and Spain as a
leadership vacuum constrains efforts to cope with Europe’s
third-biggest debt after Italy and Greece.  Yields on Turkish benchmark two-year lira bonds climbed 5
basis points to 7.65 today, according to an ABN Amro index. The
lira weakened 0.3 percent to 1.3986 per dollar as of 2:44 p.m.
in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
