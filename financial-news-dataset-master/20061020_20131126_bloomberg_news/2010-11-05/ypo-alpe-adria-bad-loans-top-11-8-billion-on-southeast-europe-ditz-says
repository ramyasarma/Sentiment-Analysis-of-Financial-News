Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank International
AG, the Austrian lender nationalized last year, may have more
non-performing loans than previously reported because of
depressed asset prices in southeast Europe, Vienna’s Format
magazine said, citing an interview with Chairman Johannes Ditz.  "The sum may eventually climb a little more" from the
reported 8.3 billion euros of bad loans, Ditz said, according to
the report. The bank’s bad loans will be below 10 billion euros,
Ditz told Format.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
