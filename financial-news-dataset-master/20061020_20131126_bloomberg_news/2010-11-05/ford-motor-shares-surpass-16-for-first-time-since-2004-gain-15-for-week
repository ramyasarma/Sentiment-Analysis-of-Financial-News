Ford Motor Co.  surpassed $16 for the
first time in six years in New York trading and completed a 15
percent gain for the week after reporting a U.S. sales increase.  Ford rose 35 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $16.21 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the highest closing
price since June 23, 2004. Ford said Nov. 3 that its October
sales increased 15 percent on surging demand for pickups, sport-
utility vehicles and cars. Ford shares have gained for five
straight days and have risen 62 percent this year.  Ford increased its U.S. market share last month as
industrywide sales reached a 12.3 million seasonally adjusted
annual pace, the fastest of the year. The second-largest U.S.
automaker won 16.7 percent of the market in the first 10 months
of the year, up from 15.2 percent a year earlier. Ford expects
to lift share in its  home market  for the second straight year
for the first time since 1992 and 1993.  “I’m enjoying this, and I could see it running even
higher,” said  Bernie McGinn , president of McGinn Investment
Management in Alexandria, Virginia, which owns 330,000 Ford
common shares. “The Ford story just keeps getting better. This
is a company on its way to becoming investment grade and a solid
long-term company.”  Of  17 analysts  covering Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, 11
recommend buying the shares, 5 advise holding and 1 recommends
selling, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In January
2009, 1 analyst had a buy rating while 8 said hold and 3 said
sell. Ford was the only major U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
