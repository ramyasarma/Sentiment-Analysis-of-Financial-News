New York Mets clubhouse manager
Charlie Samuels was suspended without pay after he was linked to
a probe into illegal gambling,  the New York Times reported ,
citing a lawyer familiar with the investigation.  The gambling is said to be tied to football, the lawyer
told the Times. The racketeering bureau of the Queens district
attorney’s office is conducting the investigation.  “Last Wednesday, the Mets suspended Charlie Samuels
indefinitely without pay,” the Major League Baseball team said
in a statement. “As this is an ongoing personnel matter, we
have no further comment.”  Samuels has been the Mets’ clubhouse manager for the past
27 seasons, the Times said. He joined the team in 1976 after
working for the Philadelphia Phillies. His suspension came two
days before the Mets hired new general manager  Sandy Alderson .  To contact the reporter on this story:
