Colombia’s annual inflation rate may
be close to 2 percent next year and as low as 2.6 percent in
2010 due in part to a strong peso that has helped restrain
consumer prices, central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe  said.  Uribe defended the bank’s decision to purchase “at least”
$20 million daily in the spot market as a means to stem the
peso’s rally against the criticism that the amount is not
significant enough given the size of the market.  Currency intervention “has had a very important impact”
on the peso, Uribe said. “It has clearly worked.”  The  bank  has said it would buy dollars “at least through
March 15.”  The peso has gained 12.3 percent against the dollar in 2010
-- the third-best performance among the 31 most-traded
currencies tracked by Bloomberg after Japan’s yen and
Australia’s dollar -- as foreign investors flood the country
with capital amid near-zero interest rates in the U.S., Japan
and other developed economies.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 1,820.70 per dollar from
1818.15 yesterday.  Uribe said the economy should grow at a faster clip next
year than in 2010 when it is expected to expand 4.5 percent. The
bank last week said growth next year would likely reach 4.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
