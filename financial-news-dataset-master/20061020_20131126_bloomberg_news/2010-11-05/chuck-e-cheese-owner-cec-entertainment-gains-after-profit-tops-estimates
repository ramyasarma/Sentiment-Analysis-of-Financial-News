CEC Entertainment Inc.  rose the most
in a year after the operator of  Chuck E. Cheese’s  family
restaurants reported third-quarter earnings that topped
analysts’ estimates.  CEC  climbed  $2.33, or 6.8 percent, to $36.80 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The gain was the
largest since Oct. 30, 2009. The shares have advanced 15 percent
this year, compared with an 18 percent  increase  in the Standard
& Poor’s Smallcap 600 Index.  The company has been overhauling locations during the
recession in an effort to keep families dining at Chuck E.
Cheese’s restaurants. Slots for birthday parties have been
lengthened while a new “Ticket Blaster” online video game has
been installed, allowing kids to play while dining on pizzas and
toasted sandwiches.  Third-quarter profit excluding some items rose 18 percent
to 65 cents, the Irving, Texas-based company said yesterday in a
statement. That compared with the 61-cent average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales increased 5 percent to $207 million
from $198 million, compared with analysts’ estimates of $202
million.  CEC expects to spend about $64 million this year to upgrade
240 of its stores, including 29 expansions and 15 remodels,
Chief Executive Officer  Michael Magusiak  said on a conference
call yesterday. The company owns about 500 locations, almost all
in the U.S. and Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
