Brazil’s benchmark  Bovespa  equity
index may climb to 90,000 points before the end of next year, a
24 percent gain, because the nation’s stocks are inexpensive and
the economy is expanding, said BlackRock Inc.’s  Will Landers .  The gauge may rally to 90,000 sometime in the second half
of 2011, said Landers, whose $1.1 billion  BlackRock Latin
America Fund  has returned 23 percent in the past five years,
more than 90 percent of competitors.  The Bovespa’s price-to-earnings ratio “is still one of the
lowest between the emerging countries,” Landers, who helps
oversee $7 billion in Brazil and $10 billion in Latin America,
said yesterday in a telephone interview from Plainsboro, New
Jersey. “With the economy growing, the need for foreign
investment in infrastructure, there will be lots of investors
interested in Brazil.”  The gauge is about 1 percent below its all-time high
reached in May 2008 and trades at 15 times reported earnings,
compared with 26 times profit a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s economy will grow 7.5 percent
this year and 4.1 percent in 2011, according to forecasts from
the International Monetary Fund.  The Bovespa fell 0.4 percent to 72,704.72 at 2:03 p.m. New
York time today after climbing to the highest level in more than
two years yesterday.  The U.S. Federal Reserve announced Nov. 3 it will buy about
$75 billion of Treasuries each month through June, for a total
of $600 billion, because of “disappointingly slow” progress in
spurring economic growth. That decision should boost emerging-
market currencies and hurt the dollar, Landers said.  “Our portfolio is more focused on companies targeting the
real economy, like banks and homebuilders,” Landers said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
