Drax Group Plc , owner of Western
Europe’s largest coal power station, said  Phil Mckelvey  is
trading carbon permits for the plant after  Rob Husher  left.  The 4,000-megawatt Drax power station in Selby, northern
England, is under Europe’s carbon cap-and-trade program and has
an annual limit of 9.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in
the five years through 2012.  Mckelvey, the company’s coal trader, will trade emissions
permits, Melanie Wedgbury, a Drax spokeswoman, said by e-mail.
Husher declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  The power station spewed 19.9 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide last year, according to data published by the European
Union, making it Britain’s largest single source of emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
