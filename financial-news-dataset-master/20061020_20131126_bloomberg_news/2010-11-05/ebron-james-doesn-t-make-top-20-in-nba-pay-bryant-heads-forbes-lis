Miami Heat teammates  LeBron James ,
 Dwyane Wade  and  Chris Bosh  don’t make enough money to put them
among the National Basketball Association’s 20 highest-paid
players, Forbes said.  James and Bosh will get $14.5 million each this season from
the Heat, $10.3 million less than top-earning  Kobe Bryant  will
receive from the Los Angeles Lakers. Wade will be paid $14
million, the report said.  James will gross more than $40 million when endorsements
from companies including  Coca-Cola Co. ,  Nike Inc.  and  McDonald’s
Corp.  are added to his salary, Forbes said. Sponsorships lift
Bryant’s salary nearer to $50 million. No other NBA player will
earn more than $30 million from salary and sponsors.  James, the two-time reigning NBA Most Valuable Player, left
the Cleveland Cavaliers in July after seven seasons to join
fellow All-Stars Wade and Bosh at the Heat.  The arrival of James and Bosh, and Wade’s decision to stay,
led Las Vegas oddsmakers to make the Heat the odds-on favorite
to win the NBA title for the first time since 2006. Miami has
won four straight games since losing its season opener to the
Boston Celtics.  Bryant, 32, replaced  Tracy McGrady  at the top of the salary
list when he signed a three-year, $83.5 million extension in
April, Forbes said. Bryant should stay on top through the 2013-
14 season, when his salary increases to $30.5 million, it said.  McGrady to Pistons  McGrady played in 30 games last season, split between the
Houston Rockets and the New York Knicks, after knee surgery in
the middle of the 2008-9 season. The Knicks beat the Chicago
Bulls 120-112 last night.  McGrady is being paid $1.35 million this year by the
Detroit Pistons after earning $23 million in the final year of
his previous contract, ESPN reported Aug. 10.  Team owners are looking to cut players’ salaries by $800
million, or 35 percent, under a new labor accord. The current
agreement expires at the end of the season.  Orlando Magic forward  Rashard Lewis , who signed a six-year
contract worth $118 million, is second on the Forbes list at
$20.5 million.  Kevin Garnett  of the Celtics is third at $18.8 million,
followed by  Tim Duncan  of the San Antonio Spurs at $18.7
million.  Michael Redd  of the Milwaukee Bucks rounds out the top
five at $18.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
