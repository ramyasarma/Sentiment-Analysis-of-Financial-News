Orca Exploration Group Inc. , the
largest natural-gas supplier in East Africa, plans to more than
double output from its Songo Songo project off Tanzania’s east
coast within 2 1/2 years.  Production should rise to 200 million cubic feet a day from
90 million cubic feet currently,  Peter Clutterbuck , deputy
chairman of the Dar es Salaam-based company, told the Africa
Upstream oil conference in Cape Town today.  Orca  plans to drill for gas in the Songo Songo West field
late next year, Clutterbuck said. The field may contain 500
billion cubic feet of reserves, while the main field has about
900 billion cubic feet, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
