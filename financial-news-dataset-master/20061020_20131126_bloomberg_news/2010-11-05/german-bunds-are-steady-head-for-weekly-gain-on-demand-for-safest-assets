German 10-year bunds headed for a
weekly gain as mounting concern that so-called peripheral
nations will need to restructure their debt boosted demand for
the euro region’s safest assets.  The 10-year bund was little changed and is set for its
first weekly advance in four. Debt issued by Ireland, Portugal
and Spain came under renewed pressure this week after German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said bondholders should share the cost
of any restructuring, rather than leaving taxpayers “on the
hook.” The difference in yield, or  spread , between Irish bonds
and benchmark German bunds reached a record 527 basis points
yesterday, according to Bloomberg generic data.  “Bunds have caught a safe-haven bid,” said  Marc Ostwald ,
a bond analyst at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “The
peripheral markets slumped on fears of debt restructuring. The
task of meeting harsh budget cuts may make the issue of debt
servicing even more acute.”  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark security,
was unchanged at 2.38 percent at 8:40 a.m. in London. The yield
has dropped 13 basis points this week, according to Bloomberg
generic data. The 2.25 percent security maturing in September
2020 rose 0.02, or 20 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,422) face
amount to 98.85. The two-year note yield was also little changed
at 0.92 percent, a decline of seven basis points on the week.  German bonds have returned 8.7 percent this year, compared
with a 9.2 percent gain for U.S. Treasuries, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Irish debt has lost 10 percent,
the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
