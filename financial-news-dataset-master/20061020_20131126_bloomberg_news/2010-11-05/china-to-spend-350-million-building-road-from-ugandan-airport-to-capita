China will invest $350 million to
build and manage a toll road from  Uganda ’s Entebbe International
Airport to the capital, Kampala, said  Syda Bbumba , the East
African country’s finance minister.  The new road will help ease congestion as the existing 36-
kilometer (22-miles) link is regularly blocked with traffic,
Bbumba told reporters today in Kampala, the capital. Talks on
details about the project are continuing, she said.  China is a main source of foreign direct investment in
Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest economy, where commercially
viable oil deposits have been discovered, according to the
Uganda Investment Authority.  China will also offer Uganda $14.8 million in grants and
loans for two other projects. A grant of $7.4 million will be
spent on an office block that will house the Ugandan president
and prime minister’s offices, Bbumba said. A second interest-
free, 20-year loan will be used for “a project which is yet to
be agreed upon by the two governments,” she said, without
elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
