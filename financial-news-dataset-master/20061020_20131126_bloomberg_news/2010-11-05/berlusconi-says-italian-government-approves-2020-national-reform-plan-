Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said
the Italian government has approved its “National Reform Plan”
for sustainable growth by 2020, saying it will be delivered to
the European Union this month.  The European Commission in March unveiled its 2020 plan,
which calls for all 27 EU nations to implement strategies to
boost sustainable economic growth over the next decade.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
