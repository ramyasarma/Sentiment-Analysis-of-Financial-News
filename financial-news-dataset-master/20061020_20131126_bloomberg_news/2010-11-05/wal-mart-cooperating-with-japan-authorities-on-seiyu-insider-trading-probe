Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it was
cooperating with Japanese authorities after the Nikkei newspaper
reported the nation’s securities regulator was investigating
suspected insider trading involving employees of its Seiyu unit.  The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission is
examining transactions by Seiyu employees’ family members before
Wal-Mart announced its buyout of its Japanese retail unit on
Oct. 22, 2007, the Nikkei reported, without citing anyone.  “We do not believe any current Seiyu associates were
involved,” Kevin Gardner, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said in an e-
mail statement. “We have fully cooperated with the authorities
for their investigation and will continue to do so.”  The regulator, which has been investigating the case since
March, estimates that the suspected trading generated as much as
10 million yen ($124,000) in profit, the Nikkei reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
