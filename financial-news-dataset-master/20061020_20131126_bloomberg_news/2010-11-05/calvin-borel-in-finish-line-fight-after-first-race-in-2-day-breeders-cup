Kentucky Derby-winning jockey  Calvin Borel  was involved in a fight with another rider after the
opening race of the  Breeders’ Cup World Championships .  Borel and jockey  Javier Castellano  clashed near the scales
after the 1 3/4-mile Breeders’ Cup Marathon and had to be
separated. Borel, who won the Derby in 2007, 2009 and 2010,
threw punches and glared at Castellano.  The fight was sparked when Castellano pulled his mount,
Prince Will I Am, into the path of other horses near the top of
the home stretch at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky,
with Borel, aboard A.U. Miner, among those affected.  Stewards disqualified Prince Will I Am from his second-
place finish for interference.  “I had pressure outside me,” Castellano said on the
Breeders’ Cup website. “I went for a hole and they said I took
his lane. I don’t know. I don’t know.”  Michelle Nihei, the trainer of Prince Will I Am, called the
actions of Castellano on the track “normal race riding.”  “I know that Javier said that he was looking for a place
to get out, he saw a hole and asked him to go through it, and
Prince went through it,” she said.  Eldaafer won the $500,000 race, with Gabriel’s Hill moved
up to second and A.U. Miner third.  To contact the reporters on this story:
