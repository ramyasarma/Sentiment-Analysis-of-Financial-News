Japanese  stocks  gained, sending the

Japan’s No. 3 carmaker, surged 6 percent after boosting its
profit forecast. Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd., a maker of

deflation, and it did not disappoint the market, so that’s
supporting stocks,” said  Kenji Sekiguchi , general manager of
strategic research and investment at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $75 billion in Tokyo.
“Gains in commodity prices on the back of the weakening dollar
will continue for a while.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 2.9 percent to 9,625.99, the most among

flowing into risk assets,” including stocks and commodities,
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc. “Uncertainties about the global
economic outlook are clearing.”  The Bank of Japan today kept its interest rate and the size
of an asset-purchase fund unchanged and said it will buy
Japanese real estate investment trusts with credit ratings of AA
or higher and exchange-traded funds that track the Nikkei 225
Stock Average and the Topix index.  “Japan is the only country in the world where the economy
is in clear deflation,” said Ikuo Mitsui, who helps manage $270
million at Vivace Capital Management Co. “It seems there’s
still a gap between the BOJ’s actions and the market
expectation.”  Mitsubishi Gains  The Nikkei 225 has slumped 8.7 percent this year, the most
