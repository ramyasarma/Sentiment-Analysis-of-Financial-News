American International Group Inc. ,
the firm divesting assets to repay a U.S. bailout, expects to
complete the sale of a Taiwan life-insurance unit within a year.  AIG previously said it would consider scaling back
operations at Nan Shan Life Insurance Co. after a $2.15 billion
deal to divest the business to  Primus Financial Holdings Ltd. 
and  China Strategic Holdings Ltd.  was terminated in September.
Taiwan regulators opposed the transaction on concern over the
buyer’s financial capability and commitment to operate the unit.  “AIG is pursuing other opportunities to divest Nan Shan
and believes a sale will be completed within twelve months,”
the insurer said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  has completed
deals to sell assets and is improving profits at remaining
property-casualty units to repay the New York-based firm’s
$182.3 billion U.S. rescue. AIG reaped a combined $36.7 billion
by divesting its two largest overseas life-insurance divisions,
AIA Group Ltd. and American Life Insurance Co., the firm said
this week.  Nan Shan, based in Taipei, was founded in July 1963 and was
bought in January 1970 by American International Underwriters
Ltd., the predecessor to AIG’s property and general insurance
unit, according to Nan Shan’s  website .  Chinatrust Financial Holding Co.  said in August it was
still interested in buying Nan Shan. The firm failed in a bid
for Nan Shan in October last year.  -- Editors:  William Ahearn ,  Gregory Mott   To contact the reporter on this story:
