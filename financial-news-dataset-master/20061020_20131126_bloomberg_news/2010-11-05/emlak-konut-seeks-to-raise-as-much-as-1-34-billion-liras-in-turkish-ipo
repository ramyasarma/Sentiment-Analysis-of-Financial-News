Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim
Ortakligi AS, a state-owned Turkish property developer, set a
price range of 1.60 liras to 2.15 liras per share for its
initial public offering next week.  Emlak Konut, owned by government housing agency Toki, will
sell 625 million shares, or a 25 percent stake, on Nov. 8-9, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  UniCredit Spa  and
 Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi AS  are managing the sale, which
may raise as much as 1.34 billion liras ($955 million).  Five Turkish  real estate investment trusts  have sold shares
to the public so far this year, taking advantage of rising
demand for homes after interest rates plunged to a historic low.
Istanbul-based Emlak Konut, which has assets worth about 6.9
billion liras, buys land from state institutions such as the
Treasury, army and roads authority, and then hires contractors
to build housing compounds, sharing the revenue with them.  “We will use the proceeds from the IPO in new projects,”
Murat Kurum, chief executive officer of the company, said in the
statement.  Turkey’s benchmark one-week repo rate stands at 7 percent.
The central bank has kept interest rates on hold for a year,
after slashing them in 2009 in response to the global crisis.
The country’s economy  grew  at an annual pace of about 11 percent
in the first half of 2010.  Emlak Konut had sales of 558 million liras and net income
of 201 million liras in the first nine months of this year,
Kurum said. The statement didn’t provide year-earlier
comparisons. Its debt stood at 1.28 billion liras.  The developer has completed 350,000 homes and is contracted
to build a further 100,000, Chairman Erdogan Bayraktar said
Sept. 30. It aims to reach 500,000 homes before Turkey’s next
election, which is due in June. Emlak Konut has 5 million square
meters (1,236 acres) of land available for new projects and
needs 5 billion liras in financing, some of which it will raise
in the IPO, Bayraktar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
