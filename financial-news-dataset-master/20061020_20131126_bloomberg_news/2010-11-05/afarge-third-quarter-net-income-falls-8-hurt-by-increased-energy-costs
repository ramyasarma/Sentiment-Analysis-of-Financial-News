Lafarge SA , the world’s biggest
cement maker, said third-quarter profit fell 8 percent as higher
energy costs offset costs cuts and favorable exchange rates.  Net income declined to 372 million euros ($528 million)
from 404 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company
said in a statement today. That compares with an average
 estimate  of a 357 million-euro profit in a Bloomberg survey of
seven analysts. Revenue rose 6 percent to 4.5 billion euros in
the quarter.  “While we remain prudent on mature market trends as we
enter 2011, we expect to see solid growth in the emerging
markets,” Lafarge said in the statement.  Lafarge Chief Executive Officer  Bruno Lafont  is cutting
costs and seeking to sell at least 500 million euros of assets
in 2010 as Europe’s  most  indebted cement maker tries to keep its
investment-grade credit  rating  amid a construction slump in
Europe and the U.S. German rival HeidelbergCement AG, the
world’s third-largest maker of cement and concrete, yesterday
said third-quarter sales rose 13 percent.  Lafarge predicted cement volumes in its markets will
increase 3 percent at best this year. In the worst case, they
may fall by 1 percent, it repeated.  The French company cut costs by 300 million euros so far
this year, of which 170 million euros are “structural,” the
company said. It said it has already “secured” more than 350
million euros of divestments so far this year.  The company’s net debt rose to 14.7 billion euros on Sept.
30 from 14.6 billion euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
