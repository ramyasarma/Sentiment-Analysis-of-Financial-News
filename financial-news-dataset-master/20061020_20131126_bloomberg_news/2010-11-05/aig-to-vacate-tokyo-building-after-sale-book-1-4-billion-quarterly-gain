American International Group Inc. ,
the insurer bailed out by the U.S., will vacate an office
building in Tokyo next month and record a $1.4 billion gain on
the transaction in the fourth quarter.  AIG agreed in May 2009 to sell the property, which includes
a 15-story building overlooking Japan’s Imperial Palace and an
acre of land, for about 115.5 billion yen and remained a tenant
of buyer Nippon Life Insurance Co. The deal wasn’t booked as a
sale under U.S. accounting rules because AIG was still leasing
in the building, the New York-based firm said yesterday in a
filing.  “With tenant leases set to expire in December 2010 and the
buyer not intending to extend the leases with any of the tenants,
AIG will be vacating the building and a sale will be deemed to
have occurred,” the insurer said.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  is selling assets
to repay a $182.3 billion U.S. rescue. AIG reaped a combined
$36.7 billion by divesting its two largest overseas life-
insurance divisions, AIA Group Ltd. and American Life Insurance
Co., the firm said this week.  The building, located in central Tokyo’s Marunouchi
business district, was constructed in 1974 and has 404,294
square feet (37,560 square meters). Tokyo is the world’s third
most expensive office market after London and Hong Kong.  Attempts to reach spokesmen for Nippon Life weren’t
immediately successful.  ‘Material Gain’  AIG said it will likely record a “material gain” in the
fourth quarter on its $20.5 billion initial public offering of
Hong Kong-based AIA. AIG kept a stake of approximately 33
percent valued at $11.8 billion on Oct. 29.  The insurer reported yesterday a second-quarter net loss of
$2.4 billion, compared with profit of $455 million a year
earlier, as it wrote down the value of units it is selling and
took charges tied to repaying rescue loans.  AIG  climbed 1.9 percent to close at $45.61 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The stock has added
52 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
