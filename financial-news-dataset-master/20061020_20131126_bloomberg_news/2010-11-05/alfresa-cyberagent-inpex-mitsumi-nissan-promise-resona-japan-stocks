Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose
267.21, or 2.9 percent, to 9,625.99 as of the close in Tokyo.
The following were among the most active shares in the Japanese
 market  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company
names.  Alfresa Holdings Corp.  (2784 JT), a drug wholesaler, rose
3.1 percent to 3,640 yen. The company said first-half net income
more than doubled to 8.31 billion yen ($103 million) from 3.77
billion yen a year earlier.  Autobacs Seven Co.  (9832 JO), an autoparts retailer, lost
3.8 percent to 2,952 yen. The company cut its full-year net
income forecast 8.2 percent to 5.6 billion yen.  CyberAgent Inc.  (4751 JT), an online advertising agency,
soared 8.4 percent to 149,000 yen. The company expects a 9.2
percent gain in net income to 6 billion yen this fiscal year on
sales growth. The company also said it will buy back up to 3.33
percent of its outstanding shares.  Heiwa Corp.   (6412 JT), a pachinko machine maker, leapt 4.5
percent to 1,069 yen. First-half net income at Heiwa more than
tripled to 9.5 billion yen from 2.97 billion yen a year earlier,
as sales doubled.  Miraca Holdings Inc.  (4544 JT), a drugmaker, slumped 3.7
percent to 2,830 yen. The company said first-half net income
fell 4.1 percent to 6.41 billion yen, citing a charge from a
change in its accounting methods.  Mitsumi Electric Co.  (6767 JT), an electronic-component
maker, jumped 7.3 percent to 1,441 yen, the largest gain since
July 2009. The company narrowed its full-year net loss forecast
to 1.5 billion yen from 3.7 billion yen.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co.  (5202 JT), a glassmaker, rose 4
percent to 184 yen. The company reported a first-half net income
of 15 million yen, compared with a year-earlier-loss.  Nissan Motor Co.  (7201 JT), Japan’s third-largest
automaker, gained 6 percent to 764 yen, the biggest increase
since Dec. 22. The company raised its profit forecast after
higher sales in Asia helped it increase profit almost four times
in the last quarter.  Okuma Corp.  (6103 JT), a machinery maker, declined 3.5
percent to 465 yen. The company reversed its full-year forecast
to a net loss of 1.2 billion yen from a 300 million yen profit
due to a charge from a drop in the value of its investment
securities.  Promise Co.  (8574 JT), a consumer lender, surged 20 percent
to 383 yen, the sharpest gain since at least December 1994. The
company posted a net loss of 3.37 billion yen in the fiscal
first half as interest income declined after the government
tightened credit rules. The result was narrower than the Toyo
Keizai estimate of a 40 billion yen loss.  Resona Holdings Inc.  (8308 JT), a lender, plunged by its
daily limit of 100 yen, or 16 percent, to 512 yen, the sharpest
drop since May 2003. The company may raise as much as 500
billion yen by selling new shares to repay government funds,
Reuters reported, citing three people with knowledge of the
matter.  Seven Bank Ltd.  (8410 JQ), a banking service provider,
climbed 4.9 percent to 155,500 yen, reversing an earlier
decline, after saying it plans to buy back as much as 2.45
percent of outstanding shares for up to 5 billion yen.  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.  (5713 JT), the non-ferrous metal
miner, jumped 6.1 percent to 1,379 yen, after the price of gold
reached a record.  Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd.  (6302 JT), a maker of heavy
electric machinery, gained 5.9 percent to 507 yen. The company
raised its full-year net income outlook by 21 percent to 20
billion yen.  Suzuken Co.  (9987 JT), a drug wholesaler, slumped 6.3
percent to 2,423 yen, the steepest slip since November 2008,
after cutting its full-year net income forecast 22 percent to 16
billion yen.  Takata Corp.  (7312 JT), a maker of automobile safety
equipment, soared 9.9 percent to 2,163 yen, the biggest advance
since July 2009. The company boosted its full-year net income
forecast by 37 percent to 17 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
