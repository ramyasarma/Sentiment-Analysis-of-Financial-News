China’s government should create
“normal” channels for real estate developers to raise capital,
Caixin reported on its website, citing the text of a speech by
Guo Shuqing, chairman of China Construction Bank Corp. There’s
been “formidible” foreign speculative capital inflows into
China’s property market, Guo was cited as saying.  Guo also said diversifying China’s foreign reserves of more
than $2 trillion to avoid risks and boost returns is
“impossible,” according to the website.     Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
