U.K. stocks rose, sending the FTSE
100 Index to the highest level in more than two years, after
U.S. payrolls climbed more than forecast and mining companies
rallied with copper prices.  Vedanta Resources Plc, Xstrata Plc and Antofagasta Plc all
advanced more than 1 percent as copper climbed to a 28-month
high after workers went on strike in Chile. Smith & Nephew Plc
jumped 5.2 percent after the company reported higher third-
quarter profit.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  gained 12.56, or 0.2 percent, to
5,875.35 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, its highest level
since June 2008. The FTSE All-Share Index gained 0.3 percent,
while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  dropped 2 percent.  “Investors thought about taking a little money off the
table today after yesterday’s fantastic rally,” said London-
based Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads. “Some
excellent U.S. employment figures spurred further buying to push
the FTSE off its lows of the day.”  Stocks climbed after Labor Department figures showed
payrolls in the world’s largest economy climbed 151,000 last
month, beating the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. That followed a revised 41,000 drop the prior
month that was smaller than initially estimated.  The benchmark FTSE 100 has advanced 3.5 percent this week,
its biggest weekly advance in two months, after companies from
Unilever to BP Plc reported better-than-estimated earnings and
the Federal Reserve announced $600 billion of additional bond
purchases to help bolster economic growth.  Vedanta rallied 5.9 percent to 2,319 pence, Xstrata, the
world’s fourth-largest copper producer, increased 1.4 percent to
1,385 pence and Antofagasta, which owns copper mines in Chile,
increased 2.5 percent to 1,431 pence.  Copper Rally  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 2
percent to $8,769.5 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange as
workers went on strike at Collahuasi, the world’s fourth-largest
copper mine.  Smith & Nephew  jumped 5.2 percent to 587.5 pence after
Europe’s largest maker of shoulder and knee implants reported a
7 percent in third-quarter profit to $137 million, or 15.4 cents
a shares. That beat the 15 cents a share mean estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  ARM Holdings Plc, a U.K. designer of semiconductors,
increased 3.2 percent to 349.7 pence. Chief Executive Officer
 Warren East  said the tablet PC market could grow to as much as
60 million unit sales next year, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview.  Carphone, RBS  Carphone Warehouse Group  Plc soared 11 percent to 341.75
pence after the mobile-phone retailer raised its profit forecast
for the full year to as much as 14 pence a share.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  dropped 4.5 percent to 45
pence, erasing yesterday’s 4.4 percent rally. Britain’s biggest
government-owned lender today reported a third-quarter net loss
of 1.8 billion pounds ($1.86 billion), narrower than a year
earlier as impairments fell.  RBS faces “a long, hard slog,”  Ian Gordon , a banking
analyst at Exane BNP Paribas SA in London, wrote in a note to
clients. “Management deserves credit for the good progress that
has been made, but it remains a long journey of
rehabilitation.”  HSBC, Rolls-Royce  HSBC Holdings Plc  lost 1.7 percent to 683 pence, trimming
the weekly advance to 5.2 percent. The shares fell even after
the lender said third-quarter profit was “well ahead” of the
same period last year.  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  declined 4.9 percent to 591 pence,
extending yesterday’s selloff after one of its engines exploded
in mid-flight, forcing Qantas Airways Ltd. to ground its Airbus
SAS A380 fleet.  In a separate incident today, a Qantas Boeing 747 jumbo jet
returned to Singapore with an engine problem. Some of the
Australian airline’s 747s are powered by Rolls-Royce RB211
turbines that were upgraded with Trent technology.  Credit-default swaps on Rolls-Royce Plc rose 10 basis
points today to 85.5, the biggest increase since May 17,
according to data provider CMA. The cost of insuring the
company’s debt is the highest since Sept. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
