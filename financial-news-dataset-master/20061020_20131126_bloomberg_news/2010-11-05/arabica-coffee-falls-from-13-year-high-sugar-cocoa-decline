Coffee futures declined on concern
that a rally to a 13-year-high will reduce consumer demand as
Starbucks Corp. said the recent gains are unsustainable. Sugar
gained, while cocoa and orange juice slumped.  The recent coffee surge is the result of speculation, and
the fundamentals “indicate a pending oversupply situation,”
 Howard Schultz , the chief executive officer at Starbucks, said
yesterday. The company, the world’s largest coffee-shop
operator, will “absorb” higher commodity costs next year,
Schultz said. Prices have soared 51 percent this year.  “What goes up must come down,” said  Angus Kerr , the owner
of Coffee ag, a trader in Cobham, England. After this year’s
rally, coffee is “falling through profit-taking and some long
liquidations,” Kerr said.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 0.65 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $2.0515 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Yesterday, the price touched $2.0925, the
highest level since August 1997.  “People are digesting yesterday’s very big move,” said
 Spencer Patton , the chief investment officer at Steel Vine
Investments LLC.  Coffee futures ended the week up 0.8 percent, the sixth
straight gain, and have rallied 53 percent since the end of May.  Seattle, Washington-based Starbucks was “forced to lock
in” supplies at prices higher than previously forecast,
affecting the earnings outlook for the year ending Sept. 30,
2011, Schultz said. The company said yesterday its fourth-
quarter profit jumped 86 percent.  ‘Downward Pressure’  “While we, along with external experts, continue to
believe that the fundamentals of the coffee market indicate a
pending oversupply situation which would put downward pressure
on prices in a normal market, speculative investors have
continued to drive up prices in the short term,” Schultz said
on an earnings conference call.  In London, robusta-coffee futures fell $16, or 0.8 percent,
to $1,986 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery gained 0.1 cent, or
0.3 percent, to 31.76 cents a pound in New York. Earlier, the
commodity climbed to 32.3 cents, the highest price for a most-
active contract since January 1981.  On NYSE Liffe, refined-sugar futures for March delivery
gained $2.10, or 0.3 percent, to $778.60 a ton in London.
Earlier, the price touched $788 a ton, the highest level for a
most-active contract for data compiled by Bloomberg going back
to January 1989.  Cocoa futures for March delivery dropped $24, or 0.9
percent, to $2,774 a ton in New York. Cocoa futures for December
delivery fell 32 pounds, or 1.8 percent, to 1,786 pounds
($2,893) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery declined 4.15
cents, or 2.6 percent, to $1.5685 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
