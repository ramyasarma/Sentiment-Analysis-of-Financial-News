UBS AG advised investors to sell the
euro against the Swiss franc because rising yields on peripheral
euro-area nations’ debt, including Ireland’s, may cause the
shared currency to weaken.  Investors should bet the euro will weaken to 1.29 Swiss
francs, and end the bet should it appreciate to 1.3870,  Beat Siegenthaler , a currency strategist in Zurich, wrote in an
investor note today.  The euro weakened 0.5 percent to 1.3548 francs as of 10
a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
