Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index set for its biggest weekly gain in more than a
year, as commodity prices increased on optimism the U.S. Federal
Reserve will succeed in stoking growth in the world’s biggest
economy.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest maker of
the lightweight metal, advanced 3.6 percent. Zijin Mining Group
Co., China’s largest gold producer, climbed 4.3 percent.  Hang
Lung Properties Ltd. , Hong Kong’s No. 3 developer by market
value, slumped 6.6 percent after a share sale was announced.  “The U.S. quantitative easing is still keeping the market
excited for the time being as money flows in, but next week
sentiment might change as investors’ focus shifts back to
fundamentals,” said  Steven Leung , director of institutional
sales at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong.  The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 1.3 percent to 24,861.68 at the
12:30 p.m. break, extending its advance this week to 7.6 percent.

ended May 8, 2009.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies advanced 1.4 percent to 14,141.33.  The main Hang Seng Index has gained 14 percent this year on
expectation that growth in corporate earnings will weather
concerns about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and
China’s steps to curb rising property prices. Shares in the
gauge trade at an average 15.7 times estimated earnings,
compared with about 17.2 times at the start of the year.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index increased 1.1 percent to
