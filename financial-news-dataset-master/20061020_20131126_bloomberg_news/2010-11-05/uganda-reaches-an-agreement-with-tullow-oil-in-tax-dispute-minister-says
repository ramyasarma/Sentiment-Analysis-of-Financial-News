Uganda ’s government said it reached
an agreement with  Tullow Oil Plc  over a tax dispute that’s held
up the company’s plans to start producing the East African
country’s first crude.  “We have successfully concluded the negotiations,” Finance
Minister  Syda Bbumba  told reporters today in Kampala, the
capital. “We have reached an agreement.” She didn’t provide any
further details.  Tullow, the U.K. explorer with the most licenses in Africa,
paid about $1.5 billion in July to  Heritage Oil Plc  for its
interests in Block 1 and 3A in the Lake Albert basin. Uganda has
delayed final approval on the purchase of the stakes, saying it
is owed $404 million in capital gains tax from the transaction.  Until the government approves the deal, Tullow will be
unable to bring in  China National Offshore Oil Corp.  and  Total
SA  as partners. It needs help to develop the basin, which may
pump more than 200,000 barrels of oil a day in 2014 or 2015.  Uganda is set to become an oil producer when London-based
Tullow begins production at the Kasamene field next year. The
explorer increased its estimate for discovered resources in the
country to 1 billion barrels of oil from an earlier forecast of
800 million barrels.  Jimmy Kiberu, Tullow’s spokesman in Uganda, didn’t answer
his phone when Bloomberg called him seeking comment.  Tullow  shares  rose 19 pence, or 1.5 percent, to 1,267
percent at 08:09 in London. Heritage’s stock gained 1.7 pence,
or 0.5 percent, to 355.7 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
