Harrah’s Entertainment Inc. , the
world’s  biggest casino company , boosted its planned initial
public offering to raise as much as $610.9 million and will
change its name to Caesars Entertainment Corp.  The company plans to sell 31.3 million shares this month,
priced at $15 to $17 each, according to a  regulatory filing 
today. The offer includes an option to sell another 4.69 million
shares. The stock will trade on the Nasdaq under symbol “CZR.”  The stock being sold by the company is in addition to
$710.3 million of shares registered for sale by  John Paulson’s 
Paulson & Co. hedge fund. He agreed in June to acquire almost 10
percent of Las Vegas-based Harrah’s by swapping bonds bought at
a discount. The resort owner said on Oct. 18 its IPO would raise
as much as $575 million for projects in Las Vegas and Ohio.  Harrah’s, taken private in January 2008, is tapping public
markets as a record slump in Las Vegas eases and casino
securities rally. Las Vegas Strip gambling revenue jumped 21
percent in August, Nevada’s Gaming Control Board said.  Harrah’s 10 percent secured bonds due in December 2018 rose
3.25 cents to 92.75 cents on the dollar as of 11:31 a.m. in New
York, the highest on record, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The securities, which traded as low as 72.5 cents on the dollar
on Feb. 10, jumped the most since June 4.  Consumer Spending  “Visitation also increased slightly in certain markets,
including Las Vegas, and there are signs consumer spending may
be stabilizing,” Chief Executive Officer  Gary Loveman  said
today in a separate statement. The company is continuing to cut
costs, targeting another $129 million in savings in the fourth
quarter, he said.  Harrah’s today reported a narrower third-quarter loss, the
result of smaller asset write downs.  The  net loss  shrank to $164.8 million from a loss of $1.62
billion a year earlier, Harrah’s said today in a regulatory
filing. Sales were little changed at $2.29 billion. Harrah’s
booked costs of $44 million for to reflect the  declining value 
of some assets, compared with $1.33 billion a year earlier.  Cash flow, or property earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, slid 10 percent to $505.6
million.  Harrah’s scooped up the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino
from default in February, gaining a Las Vegas Strip property
next to its other resorts for less than it would cost to build.  Harrah’s plans to use the IPO proceeds to finish its 660-
room Octavius Tower at Caesars Las Vegas, develop the LINQ
retail and entertainment area next to the Flamingo on the Las
Vegas Strip, and invest in the potential joint-venture
development of two Ohio casinos with Rock Gaming LLC, the
company said last month.  Harrah’s has cut more than $4 billion in debt in the past
two years by offering creditors new bonds at a discount for
their old notes, buying back other debt for less than face value
and extending maturities on $5.5 billion in loans.  Leon Black’s   Apollo Management LP  and  David Bonderman ’s TPG
Inc. took Harrah’s private for $30.7 billion, including debt and
transaction costs, in January 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
