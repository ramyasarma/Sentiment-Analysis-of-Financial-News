Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., holder of a derivatives portfolio of more than $60
billion, said third-quarter profit declined 7.7 percent on
losses tied to equity-linked contracts.  Net income  fell to $2.99 billion, or $1,814 a share, from
$3.24 billion, or $2,087, a year earlier, Omaha, Nebraska-based
 Berkshire  said yesterday in a statement. Operating earnings,
which exclude some investment results, were $1,692 a share,
missing the $1,736 average  estimate  of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Berkshire posted a $146 million derivatives loss, compared
with a gain of $1.73 billion in last year’s third quarter.
Buffett, 80, seeks to add to  earnings  from Berkshire’s
insurance, energy and consumer-goods units by placing derivative
bets on equity indexes and the solvency of borrowers. The
equity-related contracts produced a $700 million loss and were
driven down by a weaker U.S. dollar, Berkshire said.  “I’m sure Warren Buffett’s appetite for derivatives is
less than it was,”  said Michael Yoshikami, who oversees about
$1 billion, including Berkshire shares, at YCMNet Advisors in
Walnut Creek, California. The loss “suggests the danger of
derivative contracts in the first place, which probably will
limit the number of derivative bets they make in the future.”  Credit-default swaps, derivatives in which Buffett bets on
the solvency of borrowers, gained $519 million in the third
quarter after posting a $1.44 billion profit a year earlier. The
loss on equity-related contracts compared with a $220 million
gain in the third quarter of 2009.  Book Value  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose in
the quarter to $149.7 billion from $142.8 billion on June 30 as
earnings and stock advances boosted capital.  Berkshire had $34.5 billion of cash as of Sept. 30,
compared with  $28 billion  three months earlier. The stock
portfolio was valued at $57.6 billion at the end of the third
quarter, up from $54.7 billion on June 30.  Berkshire  gained  $1,080 to $125,560 in New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday and has risen about 27 percent this
year. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which rose 11 percent in
the third quarter, has gained 9.9 percent this year.  Berkshire’s derivative loss for the year widened in the
third quarter to $1.91 billion. In the first nine months of
2009, the gain was $2.57 billion.  Insurance underwriting profit declined to $199 million from
$346 million a year earlier. The reinsurance unit swung to a
loss as the weakening of the U.S. dollar increased the cost of
liabilities in other countries. The gain at car insurer Geico
rose to $289 million, from $200 million a year earlier.  Goldman, GE  Investment income, which includes stock dividends, bond
coupons and interest payments on investments in  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  and  General Electric Co. , fell 13 percent to $1.24
billion at Berkshire’s insurance operations.  Berkshire hired hedge-fund manager  Todd Combs  last month to
help with investments as Buffett, the company’s chief executive
officer, prepares the firm for his eventual departure. Buffett,
who manages stock and bond holdings as well as derivatives,
hired Combs “to handle a significant portion” of Berkshire’s
investments, the company said on Oct. 25.  Berkshire enters into  derivatives contracts  with investors
seeking protection against equity-market declines and defaults
on municipal debt and high-yield corporate bonds. Berkshire
collects premiums on the contracts, some of which mature more
than 15 years in the future. The company typically reports gains
when stocks rise and the price of default protection falls.  Currency  The dollar’s weakness against the yen and the euro in the
third quarter may have contributed to the equity-derivative
loss, according to Stifel Nicolaus & Co., where analyst  Meyer Shields  recommends  selling  Berkshire shares. Buffett has said
his contracts are tied to Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average, the
Eurostoxx 50 Index, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and the S&P 500.  Buffett built Berkshire into a $200 billion company through
four decades of  stock picks  and takeovers. The billionaire, also
Berkshire’s chairman and biggest investor, oversees the CEOs of
more than 70 units including Geico, power producer MidAmerican
Energy Holdings and Dairy Queen. In February, Buffett bought
Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the second-biggest U.S. railroad
by 2009 revenue, for $27 billion.  Burlington Northern contributed $706 million to earnings.
The railroad had net income of $488 million a year earlier,
before Buffett bought the company.  Earnings from Berkshire’s energy and utilities unit,
including MidAmerican and PacifiCorp, decreased 4.3 percent to
$331 million as energy costs climbed.  Marmon Holdings  Earnings at Marmon Holdings Inc., a maker of construction
materials, increased 9.3 percent to $212 million. The business,
purchased from the Pritzker family in 2008, has operations
including railroad tank cars and making wire and cable products.  Profit at furniture stores, jewelry shops and the candy
business increased 36 percent to $15 million. McLane Co. profit
rose 39 percent to $89 million. McLane delivers food and
alcoholic beverages by truck to clients including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and convenience shops.  “Operating results for many of our manufacturing, service
and retailing businesses improved versus 2009, reflecting some
stabilization of economic conditions,”  Berkshire said  in a
filing. “We are hopeful that recent economic improvements will
continue over the remainder of 2010 and beyond.”  Berkshire, which employs more than 200,000 people, cut
about 20,000 jobs last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
