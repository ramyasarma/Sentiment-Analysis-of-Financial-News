New England Patriots defensive tackle
 Myron Pryor  was fined $7,500 for his hit that injured the jaw of
Minnesota Vikings quarterback  Brett Favre .  Patriots linebacker  Gary Guyton  also was fined $7,500 for
roughing the passer on a different play during the Patriots’ 28-
18 victory on Oct. 31, National Football League spokesman Corry
Rush said in an e-mail.  Favre, who made his record-extending 292nd straight start,
was knocked out of the game during the fourth quarter after
being tackled by Pryor on a third-down pass play from the New
England 3-yard line.  Pryor’s helmet was at Favre’s chest level when the two made
contact, and the top of the helmet caught Favre on the chin as
they fell to the ground. Pryor wasn’t penalized on the play.
Favre needed stitches to close a cut on his chin and said the
hit left his jaw numb.  The NFL has intensified its focus on preventing dangerous
hits this season. The league said on Oct. 19 that it would begin
suspending players for flagrant hits that endanger safety,
handing out $175,000 in fines that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
