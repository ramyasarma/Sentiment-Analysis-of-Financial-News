EcoRodovias Infraestrutura &
Logistica SA , the Brazilian highways and ports operator, fell
the most in two weeks in Sao Paulo after Banco BTG Pactual SA
cut its rating on concern the company’s growth prospects may be
constrained.  EcoRodovias declined 1.1 percent to 13.03 reais at 10:52
a.m. New York time and earlier lost as much as 2.4 percent, the
most intraday since Oct. 20. The stock surged 39 percent since
it was listed in April through yesterday, compared with a 2.6
percent advance for the benchmark  Bovespa  index.  “Monumental” discounts on road concessions won by other
companies indicate EcoRodovias will struggle to boost growth
through public auctions, BTG Pactual analysts led by  Rodrigo Goes  wrote in a note to clients today. They lowered their rating
to “neutral” from “buy.”  “Growth through public auctions will remain extremely
difficult to achieve, in particular for those looking to
adequately reward capital,” the analysts wrote. “Every single
auction since 2007 was marked by extremely aggressive bidding.
We expect more of the same going forward.”  Rival  Cia. de Concessoes Rodoviarias , Brazil’s biggest
toll-road operator, rose 0.7 percent to 46.52 reais while
 Obrascon Huarte Lain Brasil SA  was little changed at 58.38
reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
