Telecom Italia SpA  Chief Executive
Officer Franco Bernabe plans to simplify the structure of the
company’s business in Argentina to “get closer to cash flow,”
daily Il Giornale reported, citing an interview.  South America is growing “exponentially,” the manager
said in the interview.  Telecom Italia last month completed an agreement to raise
its stake in Sofora Telecomunicaciones SA, the holding company
that controls Telecom Argentina SA, to 58 percent from 50
percent.  Telecom Italia plans to sell its activities in Cuba because
it could “never” consolidate them, Bernabe said, according to
the Italian newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
