The Canadian Real Estate Association
reduced its home resales forecast for the second time this year,
citing a  sluggish  economic recovery and weak consumer
confidence.  Sales will fall 4.9 percent to 442,200 units this year and
by 9 percent next year to 402,500 units, the group said in an e-
mailed  statement . In June the association pared its forecast to
say sales would grow 5.5 percent this year and then decline by
8.5 percent in 2011.  The housing market is “stabilizing” after record sales
early this year, the report said. The federal government offered
temporary tax measures to boost spending and the Bank of
Canada’s  key rate  was a record low 0.25 percent until June.
Consumers are now focused on paying down debt before the central
bank resumes increasing interest rates from today’s 1 percent,
the Ottawa-based group said.  “Consumer sentiment will likely remain under pressure
until economic prospects improve meaningfully,”  Gregory Klump ,
the group’s chief economist, wrote in the report, which cited
“lackluster” job gains and economic growth.  Employers added 3,000 jobs in October after a decline of
6,600 in September, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The
pace of job gains has slowed to an average of 5,700 in the last
four months from a 51,000 monthly pace in the first half of this
year. The Bank of Canada last month cut its economic  growth
forecast  for the next five quarters.  Home resale prices nationwide will rise 3.1 percent this
year to C$330,200 ($330,250) and decline 1.3 percent next year
to C$326,000 the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
