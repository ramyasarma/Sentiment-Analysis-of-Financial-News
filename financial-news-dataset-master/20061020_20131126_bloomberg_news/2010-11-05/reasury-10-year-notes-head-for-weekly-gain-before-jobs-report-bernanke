Treasury 10-year notes fell, snapping
a three-day gain, as a rally in stocks and improving risk
appetite damped demand for government debt.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note climbed two basis
points to 2.51 percent as of 1:39 p.m. in Tokyo, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent security due in August
2020 dropped 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 1/32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
