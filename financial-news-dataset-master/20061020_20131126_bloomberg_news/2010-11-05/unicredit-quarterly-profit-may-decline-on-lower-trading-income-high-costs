UniCredit SpA , Italy’s biggest bank,
may say third-quarter  profit  fell as lower trading income and
higher costs countered a decline in loan-loss provisions.  Net income  probably fell to 379 million euros ($544
million) from 394 million euros a year earlier, according to the
 average estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. UniCredit
is scheduled to report earnings Nov. 10 before the market opens.  Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni , who replaced
 Alessandro Profumo  in September, aims to outline a new business
plan to the bank’s board by the end of the year as he bids to
increase profitability after the financial crisis. Net trading
income probably fell by more than half to 294 million euros, the
analysts said.  “The main investor focus will be on potential strategic
and operational changes after management reshuffling,” Milan-
based UBS AG analysts  Matteo Ramenghi  and  Valentina Romitelli ,
who have a “neutral” recommendation on the stock, wrote in a
note dated Nov. 2.  The following is a table of the analysts’ projections and
year-earlier results. The figures are in millions of euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
