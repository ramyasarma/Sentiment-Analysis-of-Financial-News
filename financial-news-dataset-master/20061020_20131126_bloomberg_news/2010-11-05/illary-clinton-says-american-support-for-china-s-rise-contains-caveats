Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said while the U.S. supports the rise of countries like China
that backing doesn’t equal agreement with policies in those
countries.  “We support China’s rise, we support India’s rise, we
support Brazil’s rise,” said Clinton. “Sometimes people
mistake our support for these countries and their ambitions as
agreement. We have many areas of agreement and many areas of
disagreement.”  In a wide-ranging address to students and local leaders in
Christchurch, New Zealand, Clinton touched on the difficulties
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the need to reform the
United Nations and North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.  Clinton’s visit to New Zealand is part of a two-week trip
through the Asia-Pacific to bolster alliances and assert U.S.
leadership in the region.  Clinton renewed the U.S. partnership with New Zealand in
Wellington yesterday, cementing relations that were derailed 25
years ago by a nuclear feud. She signed the “Wellington
Declaration,” an agreement to work on shared priorities
including security and development.  To contact the reporter for this story:
