Mexico’s peso climbed to the
strongest level since April as employers added more workers in
the U.S., the nation’s largest trading partner.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 12.2024 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time, from 12.2367 yesterday. The currency, which has
gained 7.3 percent this year, advanced for the seventh
consecutive day, the longest streak of gains since the seven-day
period ending Sept. 16. The peso increased 1.2 percent this
week, the biggest weekly gain since the week ending Sept. 24.  U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs in October, beating the
median forecast among economists surveyed by Bloomberg for a
gain of 60,000 jobs. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of
Mexico’s exports.  “News like this is favoring the peso,” said  Bertrand Delgado , an economist at Roubini Global Economics LLC in New
York. “The employment problem is structural though and it’s
unlikely that this is changing expectations about the economy.”  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.4 percent, according
to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell 0.12
centavo to 133.37 centavos per peso.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the $600 million in dollar
options available today, the central bank said on its website.
The bank has been auctioning dollar options monthly, allowing it
to buy dollars as it seeks to boost foreign reserves after the
peso reached a record low last year.  Mexican government-regulated pension funds, the nation’s
biggest institutional investors, had 1.42 trillion pesos ($116.4
billion) under management in October, the regulator known as
Consar said in a statement today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
