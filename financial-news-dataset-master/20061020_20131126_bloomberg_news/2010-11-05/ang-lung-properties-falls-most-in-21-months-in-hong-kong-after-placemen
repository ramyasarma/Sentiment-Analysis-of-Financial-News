Hang Lung Properties Ltd. , Hong
Kong’s third-biggest developer by market value, fell by the most
in 21 months after placing 293.86 million shares at a discount
of 7 percent to yesterday’s close.  The stock  fell  6.7 percent to HK$37.60, the biggest drop
since Feb. 3, 2009, as of 11:05 a.m. on the Hong Kong stock
exchange. The Hong Kong-based company placed the shares at
HK$37.48 apiece, according to a statement from the company today.  Hang Lung, which reported in July that full-year profit
doubled, said gross proceeds from the share sale will be about
HK$10.9 billion ($1.4 billion). The  developer  plans to use the
money to expand in China, it said.  The proceeds raised “should be sufficient to fund its
existing China projects in the coming three years,”  Keith Yeung ,
head of property research at Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd.,
wrote in a report today.  Hang Lung’s net income excluding revaluation gains and
deferred tax rose to HK$6.67 billion in the 12 months to June 30
from HK$2.39 billion a year earlier, according to the company.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
