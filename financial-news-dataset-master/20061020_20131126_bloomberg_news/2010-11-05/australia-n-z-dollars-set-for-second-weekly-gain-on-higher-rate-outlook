The Australian and New Zealand
dollars gained for a second week as investors bet both nations
will increase interest rates after the U.S. and Japan left
borrowing costs near zero.  Australia’s currency closed above parity with the greenback
for a third day after the Reserve Bank said economic growth will
accelerate next year and the Aussie’s advance will help slow
inflation. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, was near
the strongest since April 2008 as traders added this week to
bets policy makers will raise rates over the next year. Both
currencies erased early losses after U.S. payrolls climbed.  The central bank’s statement “supports the Australian
dollar,” said  Robert Rennie , head of currency research in
Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest
lender. “The picture the RBA is painting is the economy will
continue to grow at or above trend and inflation will remain in
the upper part of the band. So risks are clearly that we’ll see
further monetary-policy tightening from the RBA.”  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0141 at 11:57 a.m. in New
York, compared with $1.0149 yesterday. It appreciated 3.1
percent this week, from 98.35 U.S. cents on Oct. 29. It’s the
currency’s biggest weekly gain since July. The Aussie rose 0.6
percent today and 4.3 percent on the week to 82.46 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed today versus the
greenback. It advanced 3.7 percent to 79.45 U.S. cents this
week, from 76.65 cents on Oct. 29, and touched 79.76 cents
yesterday, the strongest since April 2008. The so-called kiwi
strengthened 0.4 percent on the day and 4.7 percent on the week
to 64.52 yen.  4 Percent Growth  The Reserve Bank of Australia reiterated its forecast that
growth will accelerate to 3.75 percent by the end of next year,
and reach 4 percent by the end of 2012.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will increase its benchmark
rate by 90 basis points, or 0.90 percentage point, over the next
year, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index based on
swaps. The forecast was 76 basis points at the end of last week.  Key rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and 3 percent in
New Zealand. The Fed kept its rate at zero to 0.25 percent this
week, and the BOJ held its benchmark at zero to 0.1 percent.  U.S. payrolls climbed by 151,000 jobs in October,
increasing for the first time since May, Labor Department data
showed in Washington. Economists forecast an increase of 60,000
positions, according to a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
