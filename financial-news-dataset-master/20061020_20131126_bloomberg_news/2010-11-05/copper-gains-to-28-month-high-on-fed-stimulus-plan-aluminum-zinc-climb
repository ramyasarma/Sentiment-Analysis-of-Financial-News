Copper prices rose to a 28-month high
after workers went on strike at a mine in Chile, the world’s
largest producer.  The walkout at Collahuasi, the fourth-biggest copper mine,
started at 7 a.m. New York time after wage negotiations failed,
said Jacqueline Cerda, a union official.  Inventories  in
warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange have declined
27 percent this year to the lowest level since October 2009.  “Coming on top of an already tight market, the strike news
just adds to the potential for higher prices,” said  David Thurtell , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London.  Copper futures for December delivery advanced 3.65 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to close at $3.9485 a pound at 1:27 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $3.9955, the
highest level for a most-active contract since July 3, 2008. The
metal rose to a record $4.2605 in May 2008.  The Federal Reserve said on Nov. 3 it will purchase an
additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June to bolster
the U.S. economy, a move that traders said will erode the value
of the dollar.  “The ongoing perception that commodities are to be bought
as ‘hard-asset’ hedge against the sinking dollar” supported
copper,  Edward Meir , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in
Darien, Connecticut, said in a report.  This week, copper gained 5.8 percent, the most since July
23, while the greenback was down 1 percent against a basket of
major currencies.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose $56,
or 0.7 percent, to $8,655 a metric ton ($3.93 a pound). The
price has gained 33 percent in the past 12 months.  Copper may reach $9,000 should the strike last for a month
or two, Citigroup’s Thurtell said. Collahuasi, owned by Xstrata
Plc and Anglo American Plc, accounted for 3.5 percent of global
output last year, according to Standard Bank Plc.  Zinc also gained in London. Lead, nickel, aluminum and tin
dropped.  To contact the reporters on this story:
