Magna International Inc.  climbed to a
record in New York trading after Canada’s largest auto-parts
maker raised its dividend and said profit rose more than
fourfold.  Magna’s U.S. shares gained $5.85, or 6.2 percent, to $99.46
at 4:04 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The
shares closed at the highest on record and have surged
97 percent this year.  Net income  rose to $241 million, or $2.06 a share, from
$51 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier, the Aurora, Ontario-
based company said yesterday in a statement. Magna was expected
to have net income of $1.41 a share, the average estimate of
four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Magna said its board raised the quarterly  dividend  to 36
cents per share after a two-for-one stock split.  “We continue to generate strong earnings and cash flow,
even at historically low levels of vehicle production in our
primary markets of North America and Western Europe,” Chief
Executive Officer  Don Walker  said in the statement.  Magna said separately today it acquired seating supplier
Resil Minas, based in Sao Joaquim de Bicas, Brazil. The company
had sales of about $174 million last year to customers including
 General Motors Co.  and  Volkswagen AG  and is the largest maker of
seat frames and stampings in South America, Magna said in an
e-mailed statement.  Resil may have sales of about $200 million this year,
Walker said yesterday on a conference call. The acquisition is
expected to close by the end of the year, he said. The purchase
price was not disclosed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
