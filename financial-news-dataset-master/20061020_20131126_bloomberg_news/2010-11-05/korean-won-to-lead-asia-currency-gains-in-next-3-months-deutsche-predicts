South Korea’s won will lead Asian
currency gains over the next three months as “domestic appetite
to allow” appreciation is building, according to Deutsche Bank
AG.  India’s rupee, the Singapore dollar, Malaysia’s ringgit and
the Philippine peso are also poised to strengthen, Singapore-
based strategists Sameer Goel and Mirza Baig wrote in a research
note dated yesterday. They recommend investors exit carry trades
funded using Taiwan dollars, saying the island’s central bank
“shows a greater willingness to tolerate appreciation.”  Speculation that Hong Kong will revalue its currency is
likely to intensify in coming months, the strategists forecast.
They also said China’s benchmark 10-year bond yield is expected
to climb above 4 percent “in the next few months” as monetary
policy is tightened to control inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
