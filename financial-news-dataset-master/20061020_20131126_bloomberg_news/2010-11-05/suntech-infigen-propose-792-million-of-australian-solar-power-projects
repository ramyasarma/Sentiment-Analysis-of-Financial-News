Suntech Power Holdings Co. and
 Infigen Energy  propose building four solar energy farms in
Australia’s New South Wales state that would cost A$780 million
($792 million), documents filed with the government show.  The Chinese  solar-panel maker  and the Sydney-based
renewable energy company have applied for funding from the
Australian government’s A$1.5 billion  Solar Flagships program .
Infigen expects a decision on that funding in the first half of
2011, spokesman Richard Farrell said by phone today.  “Most renewable energy projects require a fair degree of
funding,” Farrell said. “As you develop into utility-scale
projects, you’ll need support from governments.”  The companies are planning projects in a country that gets
more than 80 percent of electricity from coal-fired generators.
Australia has set a target of sourcing 20 percent of its power
from renewable energy by 2020.  New South Wales is seeking public comment on proposals for
a 100-megawatt solar farm in Nyngan that has the potential to
generate enough renewable energy to power 20,000 homes and a 60-
megawatt project in Moree, the state said in a Nov. 3 statement.  Those solar farms in northwestern New South Wales are
estimated to cost A$300 million and A$180 million, respectively,
documents filed on the state planning department’s website show.
The companies also propose a 50-megawatt, A$150 million farm at
Manildra and a 50-megawatt, A$150 million project at Bungendore,
the filings show.  Infigen is also investigating a site in Mildura, in
Victoria state, for a potential solar farm,  according to its
website .  With the Nyngan venture, the reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions would be equivalent to taking 30,000 cars off
Australian roads a year, New South Wales said this week.  Infigen, which has declined 48 percent in Sydney trading
this year, fell 0.7 percent today to 73 Australian cents. The
benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index  rose 1.2 percent.  Suntech  has
dropped 47 percent in New York this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
