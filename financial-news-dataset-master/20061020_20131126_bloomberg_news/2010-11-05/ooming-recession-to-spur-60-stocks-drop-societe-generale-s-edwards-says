Recession still looms and the
economic slowdown will trigger a 60 percent drop in equity
prices, according to Societe Generale.  It is “premature” to say that the risk of a double-dip
recession has passed given the prospect of fiscal tightening
“coming down the tracks,” Albert Edwards, Societe Generale SA
strategist, said in a report dated yesterday.  If the U.S. government’s quantitative easing plan fails and
fiscal tightening sends Western economies back into recession,
the “unfolding liquidity driven EM and commodity bubble” will
burst just as it did in the second half of 2008, he said.  “Despite all this liquidity pouring into EM equities, they
are just another high beta trade, outperforming on the way up
and underperforming on the way down,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
