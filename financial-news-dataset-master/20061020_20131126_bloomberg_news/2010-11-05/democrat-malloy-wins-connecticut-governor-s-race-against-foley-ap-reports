Dan Malloy  beat Republican  Tom Foley 
to become the first Democrat elected governor of Connecticut in
20 years, the Associated Press said.  Malloy, 55, prevailed by 5,637 votes, enough to avoid a
recount, Secretary of State  Susan Bysiewicz  said in a statement
today almost 72 hours after the official closing time of polls
on Nov. 2. The post was one of 37 governorships that voters
decided on nationwide this week.  The AP’s declaration of victory came after Malloy gained
the most in a final tally of votes in the past day in
 Bridgeport , the state’s biggest city. A total of about 1.1
million votes were cast statewide, according to Bysiewicz.  Malloy, Stamford’s mayor for 14 years, will succeed  Jodi Rell , 63, a Republican who didn’t seek re-election. Malloy, who
 pledged  to overhaul the state’s tax code and create jobs, ran
with  Nancy Wyman , the state comptroller, who will serve as
lieutenant governor.  Bysiewicz had declared Malloy the winner on Nov. 3, based
on unofficial results. Foley, 58, also claimed victory, citing
campaign estimates. Bysiewicz then said she wouldn’t say more on
the race until Bridgeport’s tally was known.  The city’s polls  remained open  an extra two hours on Nov. 2
because ballots ran short and more had to be provided. The
secretary of state’s  website  shows the city had about 71,500
registered voters in 2009, 63 percent Democrats.  Foley, a political newcomer, started and ran NTC Group
Inc., a private-equity firm, in 1985. The Bush administration
named him to oversee most of Iraq’s state-owned companies in
2003. In 2006, he was appointed U.S. ambassador to Ireland, a
post he left in 2009.  Under Connecticut rules, if the winning margin were less
than 2,000, a recount would have been required, according to  Av Harris , a spokesman for Bysiewicz, a Democrat.  To contact the reporters on this story:
