Repsol YPF SA’s  Argentine unit
approved the sale of as much as $600 million of bonds, the first
in a dozen years, as companies in the South American country
sell the most debt since 2007.  The sale, approved today by YPF SA’s board of directors,
will occur under a $1 billion global debt program, the unit said
in a  filing  on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange’s website. YPF is
Argentina’s largest company by market value and revenue.  YPF, based in Buenos Aires, aims to sell between $400
million and $500 million of bonds a year to grow in Argentina
and expand in new international markets, Chief Executive Officer
 Sebastian Eskenazi  said in a May 19 interview. In December 2009,
Eskenazi unveiled a domestic exploration program aimed at
boosting output in Argentina after seven years of declines.  YPF’s annual output has dropped every year since 2003, in
line with the rest of the South American country’s production
after government caps on exports curtailed industry investment.  Argentine companies including candy maker Arcor SA are
selling the most debt overseas since 2007 after President
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in June restructured $12.2
billion worth of debt remaining from the country’s record $95
billion default in 2001.  Madrid-based Repsol, which bought the company in 1998, owns
84 percent of the YPF unit. Argentina’s Petersen Group, owned by
the Eskenazi family,  has  a 15.4 percent stake and operates YPF.  To contact the reporters on this story:
