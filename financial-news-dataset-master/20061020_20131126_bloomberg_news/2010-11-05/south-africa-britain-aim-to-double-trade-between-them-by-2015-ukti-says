Britain and South Africa are working
to double trade between the two countries by 2015, with
financial services, tourism and agriculture among the industries
targeted for growth, according to Nicholas Armour, director of
 U.K. Trade & Investment ’s International Group.  South Africa is the 25th-largest market for the U.K. and
its 20th-largest supplier of goods,  data  from the British
Revenue & Customs office shows. U.K. exports to the African
nation surged 29 percent to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) in
the first eight months of this year from the same period a year
ago, while imports rose 26 percent to 2.9 million pounds.  Emerging markets have become increasingly important to U.K.
companies, given the recent slowdown in demand from Europe and
the U.S., said Armour, whose agency promotes trade and
investment in 17 key countries, including South Africa, Mexico
and Brazil. UKTI is run jointly by the British Foreign Office
and the Department for Business Innovation & Skills.  “We are saying to British companies: There are real
opportunities out there which you are missing out on, and we
will help you discover them,” he said in an interview in Cape
Town today. “We need to be doing better than we are if our
economy is to recover through export-led growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
