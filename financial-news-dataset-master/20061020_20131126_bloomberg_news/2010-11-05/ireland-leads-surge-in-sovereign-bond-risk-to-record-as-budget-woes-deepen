Ireland led a surge in the cost of
insuring sovereign debt to a record as the government struggles
to convince investors it can avert a European Union-led bailout.  Credit-default swaps on Ireland rose for a ninth day,
soaring 18 basis points to 587, according to data provider CMA.
The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index rose 6.5 basis
points to a record 171.5.  Austerity measures in Europe’s so-called peripheral
countries are failing to reassure investors that fiscal crises
are under control. Ireland yesterday accelerated plans to cut
its budget to avoid the fate of  Greece , which was rescued
earlier this year, and  Portugal  is suffering higher borrowing
costs after agreeing the biggest spending cuts since the 1970s.  “Peripheral Europe is burning again,” said  Sanjay Joshi ,
who oversees about $500 million as a money manager at London &
Capital Group Ltd. “Ireland talking about more austerity cuts,
it just makes the whole situation worse, not better.”  Sentiment also weakened after a report showed Spanish
growth stalled in the third quarter, as the deepest austerity
measures in three decades undermined the economic recovery.  Credit swaps on  Spain  increased 18 basis points to 251.5,
according to CMA. Contracts on Greece jumped 14.5 basis points
to 866,  Italy  rose 10 to 192 and Portugal climbed 8 to 447.5. A
basis point on a contract insuring $10 million of debt for five
years is equivalent to $1,000 a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Sovereign Focus  “European sovereign debt remains in the focus,” Markus Ernst, a Munich-based strategist at UniCredit SpA, wrote in a
note to investors. “Sovereign credits in Europe, in particular
Irish debt, remain under pressure.”  Sovereign concerns also weighed on European banks. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt of 25
lenders and insurers rose 3 basis points to 128, and the
subordinated index was 4 higher at 198, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The cost of protecting Ireland’s lenders rose to records.
Contracts on the senior debt of Allied Irish Banks Plc jumped 51
basis points to 585.5, Irish Life & Permanent Group Holdings
Plc. climbed 45 to 753 and Bank of Ireland Plc rose 38 to 683.  Swaps on Rolls-Royce Group Plc, maker of the engine that
blew up on a Qantas Airways Ltd. Airbus SAS A380, jumped 19.5
basis points to 95, CMA prices show. That’s the biggest daily
increase this year and the highest since July 5.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index linked to 50 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 8 basis points to 426
after U.S. payrolls rose more than forecast in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
