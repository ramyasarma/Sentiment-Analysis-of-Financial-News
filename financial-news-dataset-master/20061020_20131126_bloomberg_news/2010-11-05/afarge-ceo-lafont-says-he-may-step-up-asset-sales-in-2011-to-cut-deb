Lafarge SA , the world’s biggest
cement maker, may step up asset sales next year because its debt
remains “too high,” Chief Executive Officer Bruno  Lafont  said.  “We will exceed 500 million euros” ($709 million) in
asset sales this year and continue next year “with an amount
that may be higher,” Lafont told journalists on a conference
call today. “When the overall climate improves, the feasibility
and speed of disposals may increase.”  Lafarge has secured more than 350 million euros from asset
sales so far this year, the Paris-based company said in a
statement today. Net debt fell to 14.7 billion euros on Sept. 30
from 15.2 billion euros at the end of June.  Third-quarter net income declined to 372 million euros from
404 million euros a year earlier, the company said. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell 8
percent to 1.14 billion euros, short of the 1.19 billion-euro
average estimate in a  Bloomberg survey of nine analysts . Revenue
rose 6 percent to 4.5 billion euros in the quarter.  The  shares  dropped as much as 2.7 percent, and traded at
44.07 euros, down 2.6 percent, at 1:15 p.m. in Paris. The stock
has lost 24 percent this year.  “Lafarge has reported disappointing third-quarter
earnings,”  Rafic El Haddad  and  Gregoire Thibault , analysts at
Natixis in Paris, wrote in a note. “We think that the consensus
for 2010 earnings will be lowered.” Natixis has a “neutral”
rating on the shares.  Construction Slump  German rival HeidelbergCement AG, the world’s third-largest
maker of cement and concrete, yesterday said third-quarter sales
rose 13 percent.  Lafont reiterated that Lafarge will continue to cut costs
and invest no more than 1 billion euros in 2011 to achieve a
“significant increase” in its cash flow-to-debt ratio next
year as he tries to keep the company’s investment-grade credit
 rating . Europe’s  most indebted  cement maker inflated borrowings
when it paid $15 billion for Orascom Construction’s cement
operations at the start of 2008, just before a construction
slump in Europe and North America.  Seventy percent of Lafarge’s cement production capacity is
now in emerging markets, where the company sees “sustained
growth,” Lafont said. Lafarge doesn’t need to make
“significant extra investment in these countries until 2014 or
2015,” the CEO said.  The company has cut costs by 300 million euros this year,
of which 170 million euros are “structural” cuts, the company
said. The energy bill rose by 38 million euros in the third
quarter to 485 million euros, Lafont said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
