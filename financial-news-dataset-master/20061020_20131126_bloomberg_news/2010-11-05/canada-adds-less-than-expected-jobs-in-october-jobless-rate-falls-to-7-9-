Canada added fewer jobs than expected
while the country’s main realtor group cuts its home resales
forecast, underscoring the economic recovery will remain
sluggish.  Employment  rose by 3,000 after a decline of 6,600 in
September, Statistics Canada said today, versus economist
 predictions  for a 15,000 gain. The  jobless rate  declined to 7.9
percent from 8 percent as the labor force shrank. The Canadian
Real Estate Association today reduced its forecast for the
second time this year, citing weak consumer confidence.  The Bank of Canada left its key policy interest rate
unchanged at 1 percent while cutting its economic  growth
forecast  last month and saying it will take until the end of
2012 for output to reach full potential. The central bank also
said that unemployment “remains elevated,” while Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  has curbed increases in payroll taxes to
foster hiring.  “It looks like 8 percent is going to be about as low as we
can go, at least within the next year,” said  Derek Burleton , a
senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank in Toronto, referring
to the jobless rate. “Consumers are going to constrain their
rate of spending to a modest clip.”  The jobless rate will average 7.9 percent in the first two
quarters of next year, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Jobless Rate  “Although employment has returned to its pre-recession
level of October 2008, the unemployment rate remains around 8
percent, well above its pre-recession level of 6.2 percent,”
Statistics Canada’s report said. The pace of job gains has
slowed to an average of 5,700 in the last four months from a
51,000 monthly pace in the first half of this year.  The Canadian dollar, nicknamed the loonie, advanced 0.2
percent to C$1.0007 per U.S. dollar at 11:22 a.m. in Toronto
from C$1.0022 yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 99.94 U.S.
cents. The currency recovered earlier losses after a U.S. report
showed payrolls climbed 151,000, exceeding all estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “We continue to see a gradual economic recovery unfolding,
albeit at a slower pace in the fourth quarter,”  Luc Jobin ,
chief financial officer at Canadian National Railway Co., said
on an Oct. 26 earnings call.  Home resales will fall 4.9 percent to 442,200 units this
year and by 9 percent next year to 402,500 units, the real
estate group said today, the second forecast reduction this
year. Prices will decline 1.3 percent next year, the most since
1998, said spokeswoman Linda Kristal.  ‘Under Pressure’  Consumers are now focused on paying down debt before the
central bank resumes increasing interest rates from today’s 1
percent, the Ottawa-based group said. “Consumer sentiment will
likely remain under pressure until economic prospects improve
meaningfully,”  Gregory Klump , the group’s chief economist,
wrote in the report, which cited “lackluster” job gains and
economic growth.  Average hourly wages advanced 2.1 percent in October from a
year earlier, slower than September’s 2.3 percent pace,
Statistics Canada said today.  To be sure, some of the details of today’s jobs report were
more encouraging than the headlines. “We are retaining the vast
majority of the jobs we created over the course of the past
year,” said  Derek Holt , economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in
Toronto. “We are converting from part-time jobs to full-time
jobs,” he said.  In October,  full-time  employment rose by 47,200 and part-
time jobs fell by 44,200. Over the past three months full-time
work has grown by about 164,000 while part-time jobs have
declined by about 132,000, Statistics Canada said.  Payroll employment  advanced  by 27,000 positions in October,
and self-employment fell by 24,100, the agency said. Private
companies hired 37,800 people and public sector employment fell
by 10,700, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
