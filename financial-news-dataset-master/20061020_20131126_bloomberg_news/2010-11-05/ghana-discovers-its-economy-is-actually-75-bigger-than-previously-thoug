Ghana’s economy is 75 percent bigger
than previously calculated, the country’s Statistical Service
said, slashing the relative size of the fiscal deficit and the
current account shortfall.  The West African nation’s gross domestic product this year
is 44.8 billion cedis ($31.2 billion), compared with the
previous estimate of 25.6 billion cedis, Grace Bediako, head of
the Accra-based agency, told reporters today.  “The revisions will be a huge positive for the relative
risk matrix” of Ghana,  Stephen Bailey-Smith , an analyst at
Standard Bank Plc in London, said in a note to clients. The
changes “should foster a rating upgrade.”  The yield on Ghana’s  91-day Treasury bills  is about 12.4
percent, compared with inflation of 9.4 percent, after the
government posted budget deficits equivalent to 14.5 percent of
GDP in 2008 and 9.7 percent in 2009. The International Monetary
Fund said on Oct. 1 that the shortfall may exceed the 8 percent
target this year. Those figures are now significantly smaller.  The statistics service also raised its growth forecast for
this year to 6.6 percent from 5.9 percent, and revised up its
calculations for the previous three years. GDP expanded 4.7
percent in 2009, 8.4 percent in 2008 and 6.5 percent in 2007,
compared with previous estimates of from 4.1 percent, 7.2
percent and 5.7 percent.  Economic growth slowed in 2009 after the government
embarked on an austerity program to bring down the budget
deficit.  Stocks Rally  Ghanaian stocks erased earlier losses, climbing 2.83, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 6,910.71 by 12:54 p.m. in Accra. The
measure earlier retreated 0.1 percent.  The size of the economy was revised up after new economic
activities were added, methodology was improved and the base
year was shifted to 2006 from 1993, Bediako said.  “The new data series includes activities of the oil
sector, forest plantations and information and communication,
which were not included in previous estimates,” she said.  The new GDP places Ghana among middle income countries, as
defined as those with a per capita income of more than $976 a
year, Bediako said. Ghana’s is now $1,318.36.  Ghana’s economic growth may average about 8 percent in the
next three to five years, as oil production starts from the West
African nation’s Jubilee oil field December,  Kofi Wampah , deputy
central bank governor said Oct. 7.  Wampah said the economy may expand 10 percent to 15 percent
next year, slower than Finance Ministry’s prediction of 20
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
