Google Inc. , owner of the world’s
most popular search engine, will make it more difficult for
users to shift their contacts from its platform to Facebook
Inc.’s site, as the companies compete for data on visitors.  Google  will no longer allow Facebook to automatically
import Google Contacts -- unless Facebook enables the
information to be similarly exported to other sites, Google said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Brandee Barker , a spokeswoman
for closely held Facebook, didn’t respond immediately to an e-
mail message.  “It’s important that when we automate the transfer of
contacts to another service, users have some certainty that the
new service meets a baseline standard of data portability,”
Google said in the statement. “We hope that reciprocity will be
an important step towards creating a world of true data
liberation.”  Google is increasingly competing with Palo Alto,
California-based Facebook for visitors and advertising dollars.
U.S. weekly traffic on Facebook, which has more than 500 million
users, exceeded Google for the first time in March, according to
research firm  Experian Hitwise .  Google, based in Mountain View, California, rose 81 cents
to $625.08 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
