The Clean Technology Fund is offering
$85 million to fund renewable energy and so-called co-generation
energy projects in South Africa, it said in an advertisement in
Johannesburg’s Business Day newspaper.  The Fund, whose capital is evenly managed in South Africa
by the International Finance Corporation and the African
Development Bank, is offering $50 million to fund wind or solar
projects and $35 million for co-generation plants, which use
waste energy and gases to generate power, the fund said in a
call for proposals.  The fund has a total of $150 million available to fund
projects in South Africa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
