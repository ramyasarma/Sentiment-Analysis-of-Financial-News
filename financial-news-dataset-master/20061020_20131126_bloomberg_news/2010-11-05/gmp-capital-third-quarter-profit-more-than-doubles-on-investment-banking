GMP Capital Inc. , Canada’s second-
biggest non-bank brokerage, said third-quarter profit more than
doubled on higher investment-banking fees. The stock surged the
most in almost two years after beating analyst estimates.  Net income rose to C$22.4 million ($22.3 million), or 30
cents a share, compared with C$8.4 million, or 11 cents, a year
earlier, the Toronto-based firm said today in a statement.
Revenue rose 41 percent to C$100.9 million.  GMP benefited from fees for managing stock sales and
advising companies on mergers and acquisitions, including
Kinross Gold Corp.’s $7.1 billion takeover of Red Back Mining
Inc. The company beat the 22-cents-a-share estimate  Sumit Malhotra , an analyst with Macquarie Capital Markets.  GMP  rose  C$1.60, or 14 percent, to C$12.85 at the 4 p.m.
close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, its biggest gain
since December 2008. The stock has risen 1.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
