Copper may extend gains in London,
with prices in New York climbing to $4 a pound for the first
time since 2008, as global economic growth spurs demand for
industrial metals, a survey showed.  Eight of 13 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 62 percent, said the metal will advance next week.
Four predicted lower prices and one forecast little change.
Copper for delivery in three months was 4.2 percent higher for
this week at $8,544.75 a metric ton at 2:17 p.m. yesterday on
the London Metal Exchange.  Prices in London have jumped 16 percent this year, rising
yesterday to the highest level since July 2008 as growth in
China and stimulus spending by the U.S. Federal Reserve boosted
demand prospects from industries including automobiles and
construction. Copper in New York was $3.8955 a pound yesterday.  “Global demand continues to be underestimated and we are
holding a $4 forecast,” said  William O’Neill , a partner at
Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. “I see copper
higher next week.”  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of Oct. 29.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
52 of the past 110 weeks, or 47 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 8  Bearish : 4 Hold: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
