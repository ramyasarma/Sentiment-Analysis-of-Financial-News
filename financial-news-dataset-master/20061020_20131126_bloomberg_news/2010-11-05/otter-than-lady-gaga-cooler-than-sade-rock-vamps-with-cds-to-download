Some of the best new music is coming
from little-known female singers with strong claims to be the
new  Lady Gaga  or  Joni Mitchell . Here are some worth downloading.  Janelle Monae ’s debut EP was the first act of a rock opera
about a paranoid robot planning world domination. Now comes the
concept album “The ArchAndroid (Suites II and III)” (Wondaland
Arts) as the 24-year-old plots her own rise. The mishmash of
styles is both magnificent and messy. Is she  Madonna ,  Paul McCartney  or Morrissey? I can’t decide, so I’m giving her the
benefit of the doubt and a rating of ****.  “ Marnie Stern ” (Kill Rock Stars) is the self-titled CD by
a New Yorker known for her finger-tapping guitar work and
confessional lyrics. This time, the playing is hyperactive;
tracks such as “For Ash” are raw and tender. Rating: ***1/2.  “ Have One on Me ” (Drag City) is Joanna Newsom’s most
accessible collection yet. Electric guitar augments the
Californian-born singer’s harp and piano. The title track is an
ode to Lola Montez, the 19th-century dancer, and good enough to
rise above fears of self-indulgence -- the triple CD has
multiple tracks close to the 10-minute mark. Rating: ***.  Lissie , “Catching a Tiger” (Columbia). YouTube fans will
know the Illinois native for her soulful cover of Metallica’s
“Nothing Else Matters.” Now she lets loose on a selection of
her own songs such as “When I’m Alone.” Lissie sounds like a
hot, younger  Stevie Nicks . Rating: ***.  Thea Gilmore , “Murphy’s Heart” (Fullfill). A woefully
underrated U.K. folk rocker, Gilmore, 30, has been turning out a
CD a year for a decade now. Her 2001 live favorite number “This
Girl Is Taking Bets,” now has a rival in “This Town” (“I’m
your worst fear, a graveyard souvenir”). Rating: ***.  Kelli Scarr’s  debut “Piece” (Silence Breaks records) was
recorded on an upright piano at home in between her hospital day
job and three-year-old son’s naps (listen for the sounds of him
waking up). While she has worked with indie band Moonraker and
 Moby  in Brooklyn, this CD is as intimate as a family snapshot,
especially heartfelt numbers like “Salt to the Sea.” Rating:
***.  The precocious Laura Marling’s first collection, “Alas I
Cannot Swim,” was nominated for the U.K.’s Mercury Prize. The
follow-up, “ I Speak Because I Can ” (Virgin) shows assurance
beyond her 20 years. “What He Wrote” is a folky gem about
wartime letters between husbands and wives. Rating: ***.  Mary Chapin Carpenter , 52, has been around longer than the
others, with 13 million record sales and several Grammys to her
credit. “The Age of Miracles” (Zoe/ Rounder Records) is an
accomplished slice of country music. Rating: ***.  Ke$ha , at 23, has generated almost as much buzz as bigger
sellers. “Animal,” her RCA debut, bubbles with sugary pop such
as “Your Love Is My Drug.” It’s almost fun enough to forgive
the autotune vocals. The album gets an extra disc, “Cannibal,”
later this month. Rating: **.  There’s also much to recommend by M.I.A., Amy Macdonald and
 Katie Melua ,  Corinne Bailey Rae  and  Laurie Anderson .  Alison Goldfrapp ’s comeback is good, though not as stellar as its
predecessor. U.K. music student  Leddra Chapman  followed her 
sweet debut “Telling Tales” with a fun single, “Summer Song.” 
Rating: ***. Watch for her too.   The CDs are priced from $12.98, or 8.99 pounds in the U.K.
