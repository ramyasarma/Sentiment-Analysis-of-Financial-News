Credit Agricole SA issued $50 million
of 10-year notes linked to Korean government debt as the country
increased its economic growth forecast for this year.  The securities, which reference Korea’s 4.875 percent bonds
due in 2014, pay a floating-rate coupon equivalent to the three-
month London interbank offered rate, or  Libor , plus 2.38
percentage points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
notes were issued at a price of 99.98 percent of face value.  Korea’s  debt  is rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service and
one level lower at A by Standard & Poor’s. Investors face losing
money on the securities if the country defaults.  The country’s economy will probably expand 6 percent this
year, Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said Oct. 28, compared
with an earlier projection of 5.8 percent. South Korea’s gross
domestic product advanced 4.5 percent in the third quarter from
a year earlier.  Credit-linked notes are tied to the creditworthiness of a
country or company, paying interest based on the income from the
debt of the borrower they reference. They are usually sold to
investors who might have difficulty accessing the underlying
bonds for taxation or cost reasons.  Three-month dollar Libor, an average of rates set daily by
banks and used as a borrowing benchmark, is 0.2856 percent. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
