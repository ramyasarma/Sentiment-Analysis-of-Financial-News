Bankhaus Lampe, the German lender
controlled by the billionaire Oetker family, won’t bid for BHF-
Bank AG, the private-banking unit being sold by Deutsche Bank
AG, Financial Times Deutschland reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Liechtenstein’s LGT Group has handed in an offer of about
300 million euros, less than BHF’s 640 million-euro book value,
before today’s deadline, the newspaper reported, in an e-mailed
version from FTD’s website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
