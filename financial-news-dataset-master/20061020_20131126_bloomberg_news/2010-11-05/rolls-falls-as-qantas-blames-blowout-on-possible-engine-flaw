Rolls-Royce Plc , maker of the engine
that blew up on an Airbus SAS A380, had its biggest  drop  in two
years in London after Qantas Airways Ltd. said a design-flaw or
material failure was probably to blame.  Rolls-Royce fell 4.9 percent to 591 pence, adding to a 5
percent slide yesterday. The uncontained failure of the engine
that caused a Qantas A380 carrying 466 people to make an
emergency landing was not down to maintenance, Qantas Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Joyce  said on a call today.  Rolls-Royce, the world’s No. 2 maker of jet engines, says
airlines that operate the Trent 900 turbines used by Qantas
should conduct precautionary checks. Fixing the engines may not
be the biggest risk to Rolls, given that A380 customers can also
buy the GP7200 from General Electric Co. and Pratt & Whitney.  “A bigger issue is whether Rolls’ reputation becomes
viewed less favorably by airlines,” UBS analyst  Avi Hoddes 
said. “Thousands of Rolls engines in service means this is
unlikely in our view.”  If Rolls-Royce’s market share does begin to suffer, more
aggressive pricing may be needed to win orders, the analyst said
in the note to clients, published yesterday.  Since installation, the engines on the Qantas jet have been
maintained by Rolls-Royce and the London-based company conducted
one service, according to Joyce.  747 Engine Failure  In a separate incident today, a Qantas Boeing Co. 747
jumbo jet returned to Singapore with an engine problem. Some of
the Australian airline’s 747s are powered by Rolls-Royce RB211
turbines that were upgraded with Trent technology, said  Nick Cunningham , an analyst at Agency Partners LLP in London who has
covered the aviation industry for 25 years.  A spokesman for the company had no immediate comment.  Rolls-Royce made 4.5 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) or 44
percent of 2009 sales from civil aerospace.  Swaps on Rolls-Royce Group Plc, maker of the engine that
blew up on a Qantas Airways Ltd. Airbus SAS A380, jumped 19.5
basis points to 95, CMA prices show. That’s the biggest daily
increase this year and the highest since July 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
