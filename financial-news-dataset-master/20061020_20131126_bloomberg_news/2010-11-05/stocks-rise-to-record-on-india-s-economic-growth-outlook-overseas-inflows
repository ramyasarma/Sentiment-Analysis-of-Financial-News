India’s stocks climbed to a record
close for a second straight day in a shortened trading session,
as investors increased their holdings amid expectations the
nation’s economic growth will boost corporate earnings.  Tata Motors Ltd., the  best performer  on the benchmark index
this year, gained 0.9 percent to 1,244.95 rupees, its highest
close since at least January 1991.  State Bank of India , the
nation’s biggest lender, climbed 1.7 percent to 3,489.95 rupees,
its highest close in at least 19 years.  Hindalco Industries
Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer, gained 2.7 percent to
232.45 rupees.  Coal India Ltd. , the world’s No. 1 producer of the fuel,
rose 2.1 percent to 349.85 rupees, extending gains after
climbing 40 percent in its trading debut yesterday in India’s
biggest initial share sale.  “The bulls have got a boost of vitamins,” said  Avinash Gupta , an analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd., a New Delhi-based
brokerage. “The mood is very positive after Coal India’s super
listing yesterday.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 111.39, or 0.5 percent, to 21,004.96 in Mumbai,
surpassing yesterday’s record close of 20,893.57. The gauge
remains below the intraday record of 21,206.77 set on Jan. 10,
2008. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
rose 0.5 percent to a record 6,312.45 at close. The  BSE 200
Index  increased 0.5 percent to 2,660.38.  Token Purchases  Investors and traders made token stock purchases during a
truncated one-hour trading session until 7 p.m., marking Diwali,
the festival of light and the start of the Hindu new year.
Participants prayed to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, lit
lamps and made offerings for a prosperous year. Determined by
the new moon, the so-called Muhurat trading held every year on
Diwali is considered the most auspicious time to start
investments. Hindus make up 80.5 percent of the nation’s
 population .  This year’s 20.3 percent rally makes the  Sensex  the best
performer among the world’s 10 biggest stock markets. Foreign
fund inflows have surged 80 percent, making the gauge the most
expensive in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include
Brazil, Russia and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
