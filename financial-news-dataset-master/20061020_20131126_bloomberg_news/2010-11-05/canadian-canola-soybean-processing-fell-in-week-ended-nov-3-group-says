Canadian mills processed 6.4 percent
less canola and 13 percent fewer soybeans in the week ended Nov.

crushed 122,740 metric tons of canola, also called rapeseed, and
24,867 tons of soybeans, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based Canadian
Oilseed Processors Association said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
