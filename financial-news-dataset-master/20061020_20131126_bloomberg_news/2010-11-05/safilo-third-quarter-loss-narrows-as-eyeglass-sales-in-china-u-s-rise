Safilo Group SpA , the world’s second-
largest eyewear maker, said its loss in the third quarter
narrowed as sales in China and the Americas rose.  Safilo reported a 400,000 euro ($562 million) loss in the
three months ending September, compared with a 50 million-euro
loss a year earlier, the Padua, Italy-based, company said today
in a statement. That beat the 11.2 million-euro loss average
 estimate  of eight analysts on Bloomberg.  The owner of the Carrera eyeglass brand has gained more
than 50 percent this year in Milan trading after Dutch
investment company Hal Holding NV injected cash into the
company, buying stock and assets. Exchange rates had a positive
effect in the third quarter, boosting results by 7.4 million
euros.  Sales rose almost 12 percent to 237.9 million euros,
compared with the 230.3 million-euro estimate by 10 analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Sales gained almost 30 percent in Asia, 21.7
percent in the U.S., and 5.7 percent in Europe, Safilo said.  Hal, whose investments include control of optical retailers
GrandVision SA and Pearle Europe BV, purchased a stake in
Safilo, replacing the founding Tabacchi family as the
controlling shareholder. The deal was subject to a bid for
Safilo’s senior notes due 2013.  The Italian company, which also makes eyewear for  Giorgio Armani  and Dior, said wholesale revenue rose 16.6 percent in the
third quarter, while retail sales advanced 9.5 percent.  Safilo shares closed 0.7 percent higher today at 12 euros
before the statement was released, giving the company a market
value of 682 million euros. Larger rival  Luxottica Group SpA ,
owner of Ray Ban and Oakley eyewear, has risen almost 16 percent
in Milan this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
