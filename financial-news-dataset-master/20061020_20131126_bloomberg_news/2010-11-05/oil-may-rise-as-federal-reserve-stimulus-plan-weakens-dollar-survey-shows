Crude may increase next week after
the Federal Reserve announced plans for bond purchases,
weakening the dollar, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Twenty-nine of 49 analysts, or 59 percent, forecast crude
oil will rise through Nov. 12. Thirteen respondents, or 27
percent, predicted prices will fall and seven estimate there
would be little change. Last week, 54 percent said futures would
decline.  The dollar tumbled after the Federal Open Market Committee
said on Nov. 3 the central bank will purchase as much as $600
billion of assets through June under a program known as
quantitative easing. When the U.S. currency declines investors
purchase raw materials as a store of value.  “The market is going higher, higher, higher,” said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover Inc., a trading-advisory
company in New Canaan, Connecticut. “Everything is being
interpreted as being bullish here: quantitative easing,
inventories that appear to have peaked, equities at new highs
for the year, the dollar at new lows for the year and demand
that appears to be improving.”  U.S.  gasoline inventories  fell 2.69 million barrels to
212.3 million last week, the lowest level since Nov. 20, 2009,
the Energy Department said on Nov. 3. Supplies of  distillate
fuel , a category that includes heating oil and diesel, fell 3.57
million barrels to 164.9 million. It was the biggest drop in
distillate fuel supplies since the week ended Sept. 19, 2008.  Crude oil for December delivery has increased $5.06, or 6.2
percent, to $86.49 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are up 7.6 percent from a year ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
