Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said an acceleration in U.S. economic growth would
support the value of the U.S. dollar compared with other
currencies.  “The best fundamentals for the dollar will come when the
economy is growing strongly,” Bernanke said today in response
to questions from college students in Jacksonville, Florida.
“That is where the fundamentals come from. We are aware the
dollar plays a special role in the global economy.”  “A strong U.S. economy is critical not just for Americans
but for a global recovery,” he added. “So in that respect it
is very important we do achieve a faster recovery in the U.S.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
