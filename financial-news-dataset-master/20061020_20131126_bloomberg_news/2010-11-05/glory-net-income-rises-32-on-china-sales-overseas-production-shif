Glory Ltd. , a Japanese maker of
automated-teller machines, said net income in the fiscal first-
half rose 32 percent on higher sales in China and cost
reductions from expanding overseas production.  Net income climbed to 2.94 billion yen ($36 million), from
2.22 billion yen a year earlier, the Hyogo prefecture, western
Japan-based company said today in a statement. The company left
its full-year earnings outlook unchanged at 6 billion yen.  “The strong yen isn’t having much effect domestically, but
in overseas markets we’re naturally competing cost-wise with
South Korean, Chinese, European and U.S. makers,”  Osamu Tanaka ,
a managing executive officer, said at a briefing in Osaka.  Glory reported operating profit, or sales minus the cost of
goods sold and administrative expenses, rose 93 percent to 5.11
billion yen in the six months ended Sept. 30, beating the
company’s forecast of 5 billion yen. Revenue jumped 3.6 percent
to 66.5 billion yen, more than Glory’s 66 billion yen forecast.  The  shares  rose 1.5 percent to 1,844 yen as of 2:41 p.m. on
the Osaka Securities Exchange, headed for the fourth straight
day of gains. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
