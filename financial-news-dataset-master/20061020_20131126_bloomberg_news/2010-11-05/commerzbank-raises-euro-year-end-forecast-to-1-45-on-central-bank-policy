Commerzbank AG raised its year-end
forecast for the euro against the dollar by 7 percent, citing
the prospect of more bond-buying by the Federal Reserve while
the European Central Bank exits its stimulus measures.  Europe’s common currency will probably end the year at
$1.45 compared with a previous forecast of $1.35, Commerzbank
analysts led by  Ulrich Leuchtmann  in Frankfurt, wrote today in a
note to clients. They also forecast that the 16-nation euro will
trade at $1.37 in March, pushing up their prediction from $1.32.  “While the Fed pursues quantitative easing as if there was
no tomorrow, the ECB continues with a gradual normalization of
its monetary policy,” the analysts said. “Should the
quantitative easing measures not show the desired effect the
U.S. central bankers might be tempted to increase the volume.”  Commerzbank also raised its prediction on Australia’s
dollar, forecasting that the currency will trade above parity
with its U.S. peer through 2011.  The euro fell 0.9 percent to $1.4084 as of 2:08 p.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
