Soybeans rose to the highest price in
26 months on signs of surging demand in China, the world’s
biggest importer and consumer.  As of Oct. 28, U.S. sales in the year that started Sept. 1
are up 24 percent to 28.931 million metric tons from a year
earlier, USDA data show.  China  accounted for 61 percent of the
total. The country will continue to buy U.S. supplies because
domestic prices have surged, according to AgResource Co.  “It’s all about increasing Chinese import demand,” said
 Dan Basse , the president of AgResource in Chicago. “I don’t see
any reason for Chinese demand to slow because they will need
more imports to dampen price inflation.”  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 9.25 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $12.84 a bushel as of 2:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after reaching $12.90, the highest level
for a most-active contract since September 2008. For the week,
the oilseed rose 3.9 percent, the fifth straight advance.  On China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange,  soybean  prices surged
3.4 percent to the highest level since June 2008 today as demand
for cooking oil and animal feed increased.  Food  prices in China, the world’s most populous nation,
climbed 8 percent in September from a year earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said Oct. 21.  Soybean-crushing capacity in China may increase 11 million
tons to more than 95 million tons in the 2010-2011 marketing
year from a year earlier, Grain.gov.cn said Oct. 27.  Chinese  profit margins  on crushing soybeans have more than
doubled this year as livestock-feed demand rose, according to
data from Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.  “Soybean-crushing margins for imported soybeans are
profitable, and that means more demand” for U.S. supplies,
Basse said. “We don’t know how high prices will rise to slow
Chinese demand.”  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
