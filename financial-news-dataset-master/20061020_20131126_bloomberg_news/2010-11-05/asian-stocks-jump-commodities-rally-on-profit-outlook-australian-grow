Treasuries fell, with five-year note
yields rising for the first time in seven days, and the dollar
strengthened as jobs growth bolstered optimism in the economy.
U.S. stocks fluctuated after a five-week rally left the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index trading at its highest valuation since June.  The 5-year Treasury note’s yield rose six basis points to
1.09 percent at 3:12 p.m. in New York, rebounding from a record
low this week. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which surged to
a two-year high yesterday, advanced 0.1 percent to 1,221.79. The
Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six peers,
snapped a three-day drop to climb from its 2010 low. Commodity
indexes rose to the highest levels since October 2008 as copper
surged to a 28-month high amid a mining strike in Chile.  Stocks are poised for their best  week  in two months, with
the  MSCI World Index  and S&P 500 up more than 3 percent each,
after the Fed pledged on Nov. 3 to buy as much as $600 billion
of Treasuries in a second round of quantitative easing and said
it will adjust the buying program as needed. Payrolls climbed
151,000, exceeding the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News and signaling that the recovery may be
strengthening.  “This summer’s panic by the Federal Reserve Bank and
subsequent introduction of QE2 looks even less justified
following today’s data,”  Michael Shaoul , chief executive
officer of Oscar Gruss & Son Inc. in New York, said in a note to
clients.  Banks Rally  Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. had the
biggest gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, rising more
than 2.2 percent, and S&P 500  financial  shares rose the most
among 10 groups. A person familiar with the matter said
yesterday that the Fed is preparing guidelines to assess whether
banks are strong enough to boost dividends or buy back shares.  The  S&P 500  has surged 16 percent since the end of August
amid speculation the central bank will pump more cash into the
economy to combat an unemployment rate that has hovered near 10
percent for more than a year. The index is up almost 20 percent
from its 2010 low in July and almost 10 percent in 2010. The
advance has left the index trading at 15.3 times its companies’
reported earnings, the highest valuation since the end of June.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise index for the U.S., which
gauges the rate at which economic data is exceeding or
trailing economists’ estimates, has risen for 11 straight days
and turned positive on Oct. 29. Its gain in the last month is
the biggest in its history going back to 2003, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Global Rally  The  MSCI World Index  of stocks in 24 developed nations was
little changed, after closing yesterday at the highest since
September 2008. Renault SA advanced 1.8 percent after Toyota
Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, increased its profit
forecast. Carphone Warehouse Group Plc jumped 11 percent after
boosting its earnings guidance. Smith & Nephew Plc rallied 5.2
percent after saying profit grew.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.1 percent to the
highest level since July 2008.  Nissan , Japan’s third-biggest
carmaker, jumped 6 percent after posting higher-than-expected
earnings. Canon Inc. gained 3.3 percent. PetroChina Co., Asia’s
largest company by market value, added 2.7 percent in Hong Kong.  The MSCI emerging-markets  index  advanced for a seventh day
and headed for the highest closing level since June 2008.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.4 percent, while
Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite Index rallied 0.7 percent to a
record high.  Emerging Market Debt  The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
government bonds over U.S. Treasuries declined to the lowest
level since December 2007. JPMorgan’s EMBI+ Index of the so-
called yield spread on developing-nation debt dropped 7 basis
points to 2.29 percentage points.  Copper for December delivery advanced 1 percent to $3.95 a
pound on the Comex in New York. The metal for delivery in three
months climbed 0.7 percent to $8,655 a metric ton on the London
Metal Exchange. Prices touched $3.9955 and $8,769.50, the
highest since July 3, 2008.  The strike at Chile’s Collahuasi, the world’s fourth-
largest copper mine, started at 7 a.m. New York time, union
official Jacqueline Cerda said. Inventories of copper in
warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange have declined
27 percent this year, signaling demand already exceeds supplies.
Stockpiles fell to a 2010 low on Nov. 3.  Greek 10-year bonds fell relative to similar-maturity
benchmark German bunds, driving the difference in yield between
the securities above 900 basis points for the first time since
Sept. 21, according to Bloomberg generic data.  European Debt  The euro weakened 1.1 percent to $1.4046 and dropped 0.4
percent to 114.24 yen.  Ireland led a surge in the cost of insuring sovereign debt
to a record as the government struggles to convince investors it
can avert a European Union-led bailout. Credit-default swaps on
Ireland rose for a ninth day, soaring 18 basis points to 587,
according to data provider CMA. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western
Europe Index rose 6.5 basis points to a record 171.5.  Austerity measures in Europe’s so-called peripheral
countries are failing to reassure investors that fiscal crises
are under control. Ireland yesterday accelerated plans to cut
its budget to avoid the fate of Greece, which was rescued
earlier this year, and Portugal is suffering higher borrowing
costs after agreeing the biggest spending cuts since the 1970s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
