China’s new five-year development
plan makes consumption a priority ahead of investment or exports
for the first time, said Yao Jingyuan, chief economist for the
country’s National Bureau of Statistics.  The nation’s worsening income inequality has a negative
effect on consumption, and the key to stimulating consumption is
to ensure that urban and rural household incomes grow as fast as
gross domestic product, Yao said at a Caixin forum in Beijing
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
