John Block, the provincial leader of
South Africa’s ruling African National Congress in the Northern
Cape province, was denied bail yesterday after being arrested on
charges of fraud, money laundering and corruption.  The charges against Block, who is also the province’s
finance executive, relate to tenders awarded for water
purification equipment for the provincial department of health
worth 42 million rand ($6.2 million), Mthunzi Mhaga, the
National Prosecuting Authority’s spokesman, said in an interview
from Kimberley in the Northern Cape today.  Block is being investigated for contraventions of the
Public Finance Management Act for procurement irregularities on
tenders worth 200 million rand, Mhaga said. “There are three
legs to this case, there were other tenders in the Western Cape
and KwaZulu-Natal” provinces, he said.  Monwabisi Nkompela, a spokesman for the ANC in the Northern
Cape, was not able to provide contact details for Block’s
lawyers when called by Bloomberg.  “We are adopting a very aggressive stance on this;
corruption is like a disease especially in the government,”
Mhaga said. The NPA may lay further charges against Block who is
being held in custody because “we need to verify and do further
investigation into other projects,” Mhaga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
