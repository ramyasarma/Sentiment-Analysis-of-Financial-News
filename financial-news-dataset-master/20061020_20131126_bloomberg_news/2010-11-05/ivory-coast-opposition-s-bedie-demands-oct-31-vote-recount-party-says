Ivory Coast’s opposition PDCI-RDA
party, whose candidate  Henri Konan Bedie  polled third in the
country’s Oct. 31 presidential election, has called for a
recount as his supporters protested in Abidjan today.  “There is a discrepancy between the number of registered
voters published before and after the provisional results,”
Claude Ahobaut, a senior party official, said in an interview
from the commercial capital. “We have evidence of fraud.”  Bedie, 76, received 25.2 percent of the vote, the
Independent Electoral Commission said yesterday, putting him
third behind President  Laurent Gbagbo  and  Alassane Ouattara , who
will contest a runoff likely later this month. Ahobaut said they
have asked the commission for a recount and will also request
another tally by the constitutional council, which is tasked
with certifying the provisional results.  About 300 of Bedie’s supporters blocked streets near the
party’s headquarters today, said Martine Koffi, a protester.  To contact the reporter on this story:
