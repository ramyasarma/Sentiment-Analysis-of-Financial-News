Phil Woolas , a former minister in
 Gordon Brown’s  Labour government, had his election to Parliament
declared void after a judge ruled he knowingly published untrue
statements about his Liberal Democrat opponent.  Woolas, who won the northern England district of Oldham
East and Saddleworth by 103 votes in the May 6 election, was
found guilty by two  High Court judges  of falsely claiming that
Elwyn Watkins had links to Muslim extremists and lived outside
the area.  Woolas was guilty of “an illegal practice” by making
statements “he had no reasonable grounds for believing were
true and did not believe were true,” according to the judgment,
which was published on the website of the Judiciary of England
and Wales.  It is the first time in 99 years that an election has been
overturned as a result of a candidate making false statements.
Woolas told reporters he is applying for a judicial review of
the decision.  Woolas, who was appointed as a home office spokesman
by new Labour leader  Ed Miliband  last month, now faces ejection
by Parliament as a result of the ruling. The judges ordered that
the election should be re-run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
