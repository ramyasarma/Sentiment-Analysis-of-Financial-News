Bovespa  stock-index futures slipped
before a report that may show the U.S. jobless rate held near 10
percent in October, raising concern the global economic recovery
may falter.  Bovespa futures dropped 0.4 percent to 73,500 at 8:12 a.m.
New York time. The gauge rose yesterday, climbing within 0.8
percent of a record, as oil and metals prices surged on
speculation the Federal Reserve’s stimulus will bolster demand
for raw-materials exports. The real slipped 0.5 percent today to
1.6790 per dollar.  U.S. stock futures dropped today. The U.S. jobless rate
stayed at 9.6 percent for a third month, according to the median
of 80 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey before the Labor
Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
