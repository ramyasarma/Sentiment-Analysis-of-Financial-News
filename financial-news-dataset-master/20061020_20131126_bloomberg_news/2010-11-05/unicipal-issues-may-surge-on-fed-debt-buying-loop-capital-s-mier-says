Municipal-debt volume may surge $42
billion as the Federal Reserve expands asset purchases under a
policy known as quantitative easing, Loop Capital Markets LLC
said in a report.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, 2.52 percent today,
may slide to 1.75 percent under Fed plans to purchase $600
billion of Treasuries, said  Chris Mier , a municipal strategist
and managing director at the Chicago-based investment bank. He
modeled the impact on municipal issuance of a drop to 1.62
percent in his report yesterday.  “A 100-basis-point decline in the 10-year, using Loop
Analytical Services’ econometric volume-forecasting model,
translates into a $42 billion increase in municipal volume,
easily believable when new refunding opportunities are
considered,” Mier said in the note. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Such a drop in yield from the investor’s perspective
“appears apocalyptic,” he wrote.  The central bank will expand asset purchases at a pace of
about $75 billion a month to boost economic growth, the Federal
Open Market Committee said this week. The Fed’s action has been
dubbed QE2 by analysts and investors because it’s the second
round of quantitative easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
