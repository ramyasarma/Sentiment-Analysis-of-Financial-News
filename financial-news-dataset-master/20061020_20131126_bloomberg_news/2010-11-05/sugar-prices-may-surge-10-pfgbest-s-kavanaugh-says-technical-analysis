Raw-sugar prices may rally as much as
10 percent this year from a 29-year high reached yesterday,
according to a technical analysis by  Paul Kavanaugh , a senior
analyst and broker at PFGBest.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1.51 cents, or 5 percent,
to 31.66 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York
yesterday, the biggest gain since Oct. 7. That’s above its 28-
day moving average of 27.17 cents, a sign that the contract is
likely to advance to 33.44 cents and then to 34.82 cents,
Kavanaugh said. Earlier, prices touched 31.81 cents, the highest
level since Jan. 9, 1981.  “When the market makes a significant high, they often add
10 percent within the next two months,” Kavanaugh said. “We
are in another bull market already and are going to see
significantly higher prices.”  Sugar has more than doubled since touching a 13-month low
of 13 cents on May 7. Prices surged 24 percent in October, the
biggest monthly gain since August 2009, as adverse weather
damaged crops in China, Russia and Brazil, the world’s biggest
producer.  Production in Brazil’s Center South, the largest sugar-
growing region, tumbled 30 percent in the first half of October
from a year earlier, Unica, an industry association, said on
Oct. 28. India, the second-biggest producer and largest
consumer, may export less than forecast, a milling group said on
Nov. 3. India was the largest importer last year as a weak
monsoon crimped output.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
