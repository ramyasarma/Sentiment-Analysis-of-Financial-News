Kenya Airways Ltd. , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest carrier, said profit in the first half
surged 63 percent from a year earlier as sales increased.  Net income in the six months through September rose to 1.4
billion shillings ($17.4 million), or 3.11 shillings per share,
from 860 million shillings, or 1.86 shillings per share, last
year, Finance Director  Alex Mbugua  told reporters in Nairobi
today. Sales climbed 23 percent to 41.2 billion shillings.  Airline companies are either returning to or reporting
increases in profit after the global recession crimped demand
for travel. International premium passenger traffic has
increased by more than 10 percent each month from May to August,
while international passenger traffic climbed 10.5 percent in
September from a year earlier, according to the International
Air Transport Association.  “The performance is in line with the recovery of the
sector,”  Eric Musau , a research analyst at African Alliance
Kenya Securities Ltd., said in an interview in Nairobi today.
“They were able to grow cash flow significantly and they are
probably building up cash ahead of deposits next year for new
aircrafts.”  The airline needs to make a deposit of $250 million for new
planes, Managing Director  Titus Naikuni  said. Kenya Airways has
ordered nine Boeing 787 planes that it expects to be delivered
from May 2013, Naikuni said.  The number of passengers in southern Africa grew by 20
percent largely due to the soccer World Cup, the company said in
a statement. Passengers in central Africa grew by 20 percent due
to new operations to Malabo, Libreville and Bangui, while in
northern Africa it grew 16 percent after the airline began
flying to Juba in southern Sudan.  European traffic rose 15 percent due to increased demand
from London, Amsterdam and Paris. In the Middle East, passenger
numbers grew 12 percent due to the start of flights to Muscat.  Kenya Airways shares advanced the most in a week, climbing
2.3 percent to 44.25 shillings by 11:04 a.m. in Nairobi. The
stock has gained 24 percent this year, underperforming a 45
percent advance in the  Nairobi Stock Exchange All Share Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
