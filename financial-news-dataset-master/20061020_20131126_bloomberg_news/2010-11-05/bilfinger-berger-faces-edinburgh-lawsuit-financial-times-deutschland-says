 Bilfinger Berger AG faces a lawsuit
in Edinburgh after the company’s 18-month delay in the
construction of the city’s tramway led the head of the local
public transport authority to resign, Financial Times
Deutschland reported.  Delays were caused by inadequate preparation and the
repeated discovery of unmarked phone, power, gas and water
mains, FTD said citing unidentified people familiar with the
project. A spokesman for Bilfinger declined to comment, FTD
said.  The 11.5 mile (18.5 kilometer) tramway linking the airport
to Newhaven had an initial budget of 545 million pounds ($885
million), the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
