Canadian stocks  rose for a third day
as precious-metal stocks gained on demand for a haven from
European government debt concerns and uranium producers advanced
after the nuclear fuel hit a two-year high.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, increased
4.7 percent as the metal surpassed $1,400 an ounce for the first
time. Cameco Corp., the world’s second-largest uranium producer,
climbed 8.5 percent after boosting its production forecast.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., Canada’s largest
drug developer, fell 5 percent after reporting third-quarter
revenue that trailed analyst estimates last week.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rallied 127.37
points, or 1 percent, from a two-year high to 13,052.48.  “There could be some people questioning whether some more
austerity is not solving the problem” in Europe, said  Todd Johnson , who helps oversee C$230 million ($229 million) as a
money manager at BCV Asset Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
“You could see a safe haven trade: ‘I can’t trust currencies
anymore; I’m going to own gold.’”  The S&P/TSX rose 2 percent last week, the most in two
months, as the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a $600 billion
plan of asset purchases. The index surged 17 percent in the four
months ending Nov. 5, led by  raw-materials producers , as the
U.S. dollar slumped on concerns that Fed stimulus would increase
the money supply and reduce the value of the greenback.  Spread Widens  Olli Rehn , the European Union’s commissioner for economic
and monetary affairs, is in Dublin today to discuss Ireland’s
plan to cut spending and raise taxes to trim its deficit. The
difference in yield, or spread, between Irish and German 10-year
bonds climbed to 548 basis points today, from 362 basis points
on Oct. 18.  The  S&P/TSX Gold Index  gained 3.3 percent today, extending
its 2010 advance to 27 percent. Barrick increased 4.7 percent to
a two-year high of C$51.48. NovaGold Resources Inc., which
explores in Alaska and British Columbia, rose for an eighth day,
soaring 10 percent to C$14.68. Silver reseller Silver Wheaton
Corp. rallied 7.4 percent from a record to C$35.40 as the metal
climbed at least 2.7 percent for the third-straight day.  Ventana Gold Corp., which owns the La Bodega gold project
in Colombia, surged 15 percent to C$10.80 after forecasting
average annual production of 347,000 ounces of gold equivalent
for the mine’s first six years. Fronteer Gold Inc., which
explores in Nevada, jumped 9.7 percent to a two-year high of
C$9.42 after announcing drilling results from its Long Canyon
project.  Uranium producers gained after TradeTech LLC said uranium
prices advanced to their highest level since November 2008 last
week.  Cameco, which raised its 2010 production estimate by 2.3
percent, jumped 8.5 percent, the most in 14 months, to C$35.98.
Uranium One, in which Russia’s ARMZ is buying a controlling
stake, climbed 2 percent to C$5.10, extending a record streak of
gains to 12 days. Denison Mines Corp., which produces uranium in
the U.S. and Canada, soared 12 percent to C$2.80.  ‘Disappointing’  Valeant fell 5 percent to $25.78, extending its three-day
decline to 9 percent. Last week, Chief Executive Officer  J. Michael Pearson  said the financial performance of the former
Biovail Corp. part of the company was “disappointing.” Biovail
and Valeant merged in September.  Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s third-largest
insurer, climbed for a fourth day, rallying 4.1 percent to
C$15.40.  On Nov. 4, the company reported a smaller third-quarter
loss than most analysts in a Bloomberg survey had  estimated .
Manulife shares have soared 22 percent since Nov. 2 after
plunging 35 percent this year through then.  Baffinland Iron Mines Corp., which is developing iron ore
deposits in northern Canada, jumped 17 percent to C$1.11 after
saying ArcelorMittal made a friendly, all-cash takeover offer of
C$1.10 a share. Baffinland had received an unsolicited bid of 80
cents a share from Iron Ore Holdings LP in September.  Lumber producer Canfor Corp. rose 5.8 percent to a two-year
high of C$10.80. Shares of the Vancouver-based company have
gained 15 percent since it reported third-quarter profit that
topped six of eight analyst estimates on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
