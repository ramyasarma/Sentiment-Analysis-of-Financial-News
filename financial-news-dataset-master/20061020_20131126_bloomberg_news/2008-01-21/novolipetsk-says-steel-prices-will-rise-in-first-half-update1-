             OAO Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK) , the Russian
steelmaker controlled by billionaire  Vladimir Lisin , said full-
year earnings rose as much as 30 percent on stronger demand and
prices will increase in the first half of 2008.  
 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization likely gained 25 percent to 30 percent, NLMK, as
the Lipetsk-based Novolipetsk is also known, said today in a
statement. Steel will climb through June on higher prices for
coal and iron ore before a mid-year ``flattening,'' NLMK said.  
 Growing demand for slabs, a basic steel product, pig iron
and electrical steel, as well as a weaker  U.S. dollar , helped
drive metal prices last year, NLMK said. Slab prices have surged
by a quarter in  Europe  since the end of last month, according to
Sergey Donskoy, an analyst with Moscow-based Troika Dialog.  
 ``We've been expecting steel to rise, but not as quickly
and as strongly,'' said Donskoy who has a ``hold''  rating  on the
shares. NLMK's first half will be ``strong,'' he said.  
 NLMK's crude-steel production was 2.28 million tons in the
fourth quarter, 2.3 percent higher than in the third quarter.
The company didn't give fourth-quarter 2006 figures.  Pig iron 
output advanced 6.4 percent to 2.38 million tons. Full-year
steel output dropped 0.8 percent to 9.06 million tons and pig-
iron rose 0.1 percent to 9.06 million tons.  
 Hot-rolled and hot-dip galvanized steel production in 2007
rose 10 percent.  
 NLMK dropped 1.89 rubles, or 1.9 percent, to 95.58 rubles
($3.87) as of 11:40 a.m. in Moscow.
