             New Zealand Oil & Gas Ltd. (NZO) , a partner
in the country's Kupe gas field, has arranged a NZ$135 million
($89 million) loan to fund its share of the offshore project.  
 The loan from Westpac Banking Corp. includes a NZ$10 million
 credit line  to support contractor guarantees, the company said.
It also raised NZ$17.5 million selling shares and options to
local institutions and will seek NZ$23 million from shareholders
through a rights offer, New Zealand Oil & Gas said in a statement.  
 Kupe, the nation's largest undeveloped gas field, is the
largest of three projects worth NZ$1.5 billion New Zealand Oil &
Gas has stakes in and needs to fund. The NZ$980 million Kupe
project will receive a further NZ$25 million equity injection
from New Zealand Oil & Gas, the company said today.  
 ``These financings will fully fund the company's budgeted
share of the Kupe development costs,'' Chairman Tony Radford said
in a statement.''  
 New Zealand Oil & Gas shares fell 3 cents, or 2.9 percent,
to NZ$1 at the 5 p.m. close of trading in Wellington.  
 Institutions paid NZ$1 for the new shares and options.
Existing shareholders will be offered the chance to buy one share
with options for every 10 held at the same price, the Wellington-
based company said.  
 N.Z. Oil & Gas owns 15 percent of Kupe. It owns 12.5 percent
of the $225 million Tui oil project being developed off the
country's Taranaki coast, and 61 percent of the NZ$144 million
 Pike River  coal mine on the country's  South Island .  
 Shares in Pike River will be offered publicly in February
and N.Z. Oil & Gas holders will be entitled to a ``substantial
portion'' of the sale at a rate of one Pike share for every eight
oil and gas shares held, the company said.
