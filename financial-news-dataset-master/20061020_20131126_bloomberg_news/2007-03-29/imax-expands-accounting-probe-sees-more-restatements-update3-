             Imax Corp. (IMAX) , the biggest maker of
large-screen movie theaters, expanded a probe into accounting
errors and said restatements may exceed the $2.5 million already
announced.  
 The company delayed filing its 2006 annual report a second
time to review its sales accounting at the prompting of U.S. and
Canadian regulators, Toronto-based Imax said today in a
statement. The company said it can't say when it will file its
annual report, which was due tomorrow.  
 Imax will examine its accounting for revenue from theater-
system installations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission began probing
revenue recognition by Imax last year. The company reviewed six
years of accounting after finding errors the treatment of costs.  
 The new filing delay will put Imax in default of the
financial reporting covenant on $160 million in senior notes,
said Michael Kelman, a Susquehanna Financial Group analyst in
 Bala Cynwyd ,  Pennsylvania , in a report today. It is also likely
to prompt a delisting notice from  Nasdaq , said Kelman, who rates
the shares ``neutral.''  
 Earlier this month, the company said it misclassified some
expenses as  capital spending , which can be written off
gradually, instead of current expenses, which can't be.  
 Shares of Imax fell 38 cents, or 6.2 percent, to C$5.79 at
4 p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. They've risen
33 percent this year.
