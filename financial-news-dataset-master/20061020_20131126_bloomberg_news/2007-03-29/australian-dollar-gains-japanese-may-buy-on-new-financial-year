             The Australian dollar rose against
the dollar to near the strongest in a decade as Japanese
investors bought the nation's higher-yielding assets.  
 Australia 's dollar was also the second strongest against the
yen among 16 most active currencies, on speculation investors
from  Japan  will resume buying overseas bonds as a new financial
year starts in April. The currency was set for a fourth quarterly
gain against the dollar and yen as investors borrowed cheaply in
Japan to buy assets in Australia in so-called carry trades.  
 ``It screams out to me that we're seeing carry trades going
through,'' said Paul Milton, chief dealer at  Societe Generale  in
Sydney. ``We've seen quite a lot of Japanese interest in the
Australian dollar today.''  
 The Australian dollar was at 80.83 cents as of 4:48 p.m. in
Sydney from 80.66 in late  Asia  yesterday. It touched 81.08 cents
on March 26 and the day after, the highest since December 1996.  
 The currency will trade between 80.6 and 80.9 cents today,
Milton said.  
 Australia's dollar rose 0.8 percent to trade at 94.82 yen
from 94.11 yesterday. The nation's key interest rate is 5.75
percentage points above Japan's, which at 0.5 percent is the
lowest among major economies.  
 Australia's two-year  government bonds  yield 5.48 percentage
points more than like-dated Japanese debt and offer an extra 1.77
percentage points over U.S. Treasuries.  
 Barrier Options  
 Further gains in the currency may be limited by speculation
traders are unwilling to buy it above its decade-high.  
 Speculators have left instructions to sell the currency to
protect so-called barrier options that become worthless on a gain
to 81.10, 81.25 and 81.50 cents, said Ray Attrill, director of
foreign exchange research at Forecast Ltd. in Sydney.  
 ``This means the upside on the Australian dollar will be
pretty tough going above 81 cents so it will probably range
between 80 and 81 cents this week,'' he said.  
 The currency last week rose above 80 cents for only the
second time since 1996 and extended its rally as traders boosted
bets the central bank will lift  interest rates  from a six-year
high of 6.25 percent in coming months.  
 Its gained 2.5 percent this quarter as interest rate
speculation has been buoyed by reports showing unemployment near
a 30-year low, rising  consumer confidence  and retail spending.  
 The probability of the  Reserve Bank  raising interest rates a
quarter-percentage point by August is 94 percent compared with 26
percent odds two weeks ago, according to 30-day interbank rate
tracking futures contracts.  
 Bonds Decline  
 Traders see the likelihood of a rate increase as soon as the
bank's April 4 meeting at 51 percent, according to a Credit
Suisse index calculated by the exchange of interest payments.  
 ``The Australian dollar will sustain its gains above 80
cents'' and rise to 82 in a month, said  Richard Grace , senior
currency strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  in Sydney.
``Prospects for the currency are very good because an interest
rate increase could come as soon as next week.''  
 Australian government bonds declined for a second day,
pushing the yield of the benchmark 10-year security up 2 basis
points to 5.85 percent, 1.23 percentage points higher than like-
dated U.S. Treasuries. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 The price of the 6 percent bond maturing in February 2017
fell 0.181, or A$1.81 per A$1,000 face amount, to 101.104. Bond
yields move inversely to price.
