Kuwait Investment Authority, the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, decided against buying General
Motors Co. shares after the sale price was raised, according to
a person familiar with the matter.  GM’s owners, including the U.S. Treasury, sold shares at
$33 each in an initial public offering on Nov. 17. The automaker
had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Nov. 3
to offer the shares for $26 to $29 each. The company raised more
than $20 billion in the IPO, which reduced the U.S. government
to a minority shareholder.  KIA’s Managing Director  Bader al-Saad  said on Nov. 6 that
Kuwait would look into the IPO’s price range before deciding to
buy shares in the automaker. “If something is cheap, we are
interested, of course,” al-Saad said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story
