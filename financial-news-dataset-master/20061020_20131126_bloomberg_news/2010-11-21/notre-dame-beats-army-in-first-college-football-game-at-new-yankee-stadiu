The University of Notre Dame
defeated Army 27-3 as the two teams returned to New York for the
first time since 1969 to play the inaugural college football
game at the new Yankee Stadium.  Alex Carlton kicked a 20-yard field goal to give Army’s
Black Knights (6-5) a 3-0 lead in the first quarter.  The Fighting Irish (6-5) dominated the rest of the game as
Robert Hughes plunged one yard for a score, Tyler Eifert caught
a 31-yard touchdown pass from Tommy Rees, Darrin Walls returned
a 42-yard interception and David Ruffer kicked two field goals.  Notre Dame and Army, meeting for the 50th time, played 22
games in the original Yankee Stadium. In 1928, Fighting Irish
coach  Knute Rockne  delivered his “Win One for the Gipper”
speech in the Bronx. Eighteen years later, four Heisman Trophy
winners took the field as the teams played to a scoreless tie.  “We can think of no two finer educational institutions to
christen our new home with the great game of football,” Yankee
Managing General Partner  Hal Steinbrenner  said in a statement.
“Their impact on the landscape of our nation --scholastically,
athletically and through service -- cannot be overstated
enough.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
