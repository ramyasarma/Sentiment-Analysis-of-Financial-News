Biota Holdings Ltd. , which is
developing a long-acting influenza drug for sale outside Japan,
may receive a decision within three to six months from an
overseas agency about funds for additional patient studies.  Biota is also considering taking the drug, known as LANI,
through clinical trials needed for regulatory approval with or
without the funding, Chairman  Jim Fox  told the Australian
company’s annual meeting in Melbourne today. This may require
access to U.S. capital markets or merger and acquisition
activity, he said in the text of a speech sent to the Australian
stock exchange.  Other options Biota is considering to fund the development
of LANI include licensing the medicine to a partner, and
restructuring to facilitate a re-rating of the company, its
assets or both, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Cook  said in the
documents. Biota’s management and board are working with
Greenhill Caliburn to increase shareholder value, he said,
adding that the directors consider Biota to be undervalued.  LANI is already approved for sale in Japan.  Biota rose 1 percent to A$1.02 at the 4 p.m. close on the
Australian stock exchange, while the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index
advanced 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
