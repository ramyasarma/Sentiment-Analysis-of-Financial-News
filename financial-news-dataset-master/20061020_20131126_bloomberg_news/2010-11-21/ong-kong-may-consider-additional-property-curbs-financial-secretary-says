Hong Kong’s government may introduce
further measures if the latest curbs don’t stem property prices,
Financial Secretary  John Tsang  said.  “We will launch appropriate measures again when it’s
needed,” Tsang wrote yesterday on his  blog  on the government’s
website. “We will not ignore the risks that would affect the
economic and financial stability, and will closely monitor the
market.”  Hong Kong on Nov. 19 imposed additional stamp duties and
increased deposits for mortgages, the toughest measures yet to
rein in home values that have soared more than 50 percent since
January 2009. Weekend sales of used homes fell 83 percent from
the previous week, according to data from  Centaline Property
Agency Ltd ., the city’s largest closely held real-estate broker.  The U.S. bond purchase program announced earlier this month
has heightened the asset bubble risk in Hong Kong and it’s
necessary for the government to adopt “pre-emptive” measures
in these “extreme times,” Tsang wrote on the blog.  There is no need to change the city’s currency peg to the
U.S. dollar as this is not the “major factor” leading to an
asset bubble risk, he said.  The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to its U.S.
counterpart since 1983, and is allowed to trade 5 cents on
either side of HK$7.80. The fixed exchange rate means Hong
Kong’s monetary decisions track those of the U.S., which
prevents the city’s officials from raising interest rates to
cool demand in the property market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
