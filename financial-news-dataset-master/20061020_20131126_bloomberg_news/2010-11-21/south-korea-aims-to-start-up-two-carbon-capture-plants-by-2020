South Korea, Asia’s fourth-biggest
polluter, aims to begin commercial operations at two carbon
capture and storage plants by the end of the next decade to help
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The nation will develop two 100-megawatt carbon capture
demonstration projects that will start up in 2014, and
commercial operations can be expected by 2020, the Ministry of
Knowledge Economy said in an e-mailed statement today.  South Korea said in November last year that it plans to
voluntarily cut emissions by 30 percent by 2020 under a
“business as usual” scenario. The target corresponds to a 4
percent reduction from 2005 levels, according to Green Korea
United, a non-profit group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
