Japanese  stock   futures  rose as the
euro strengthened against the yen after Ireland applied for a
bailout to help fund itself and save its banks. Australian
stocks climbed.  American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. , a
Japanese carmaker which gets about 15 percent of its sales in
Europe climbed 1.1 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.

electronics which derives more than 10 percent of its sales from
Europe, gained 0.5 percent. Westpac Banking Corp., an Australian

weakening trend, and corporate earnings are strong in the
U.S.,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. Gains “for Japanese stocks should
continue as there’s expectation for excess liquidity”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.5
percent today. In New York, the index advanced 0.3 percent on
Nov. 19 as higher-than-estimated profit at Dell Inc., the

dividend increase at Nike Inc., the biggest maker of athletic
shoes, overshadowed concern China’s steps to slow inflation will
stifle global economic growth.  China’s Reserve Ratio  China ordered banks to set aside larger reserves for the
fifth time this year, draining cash from the financial system in
the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The ratio will
increase 50 basis points starting Nov. 29, the central bank said
on its website on Sept. 19.  Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said on Nov. 21 in Dublin
that he expects talks on the details of financial assistance for

details at a press conference in Dublin.  The yen depreciated to 114.73 against the euro, compared

Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 9.4 percent through
