Toyota Motor Corp. will begin mass
production of lithium-ion batteries for its plug-in hybrid cars
scheduled to reach the market in 2012, public broadcaster NHK
reported on its Japanese-language website, without citing
anyone.  The batteries will be made at a venture with Panasonic
Corp. in Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan, the report said.  The world’s biggest automaker on Nov. 18 said it will
introduce plug-in hybrids in Japan, Europe and the U.S. in early
2012, and plans to sell 50,000 of the vehicles a year.   To contact the reporter on this story:
