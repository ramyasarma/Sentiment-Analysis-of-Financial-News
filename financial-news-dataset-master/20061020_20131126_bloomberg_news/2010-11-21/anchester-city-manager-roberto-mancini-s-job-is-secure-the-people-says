Roberto Mancini’s position as
Manchester City manager is safe and he will be given an 80
million-pound ($127.8 million) transfer fund in January, The
People reported.  Mancini will only be fired by the Premier League soccer
club if City fails to qualify for next season’s Champions
League, the newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko and Benfica defender David
Luiz are among Mancini’s targets for the next so-called transfer
window, the People reported. He will first be expected to sell
some fringe players such as Shaun Wright-Phillips and Roque
Santa Cruz, the newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
