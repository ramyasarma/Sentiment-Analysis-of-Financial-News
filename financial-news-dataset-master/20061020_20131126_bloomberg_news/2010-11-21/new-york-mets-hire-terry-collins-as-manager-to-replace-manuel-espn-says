The New York Mets have selected
Terry Collins as their manager, ESPN reports, citing an
unidentified team official.  Collins, 61, has a Major League Baseball managerial record
of 444-434 with the Houston Astros and Anaheim Angels. He hasn’t
managed in the majors since 1999, when he was fired by the
Angels with 29 games left in the regular season.   The Mets finished below .500 each of the last two seasons
and haven’t made the World Series since losing in five games to
the New York Yankees in 2000.  Collins, who managed the Orix Buffaloes of Japan in 2007
and 2008, was one of four finalists to replace Jerry Manuel,
along with Wally Backman, Chip Hale and Bob Melvin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
