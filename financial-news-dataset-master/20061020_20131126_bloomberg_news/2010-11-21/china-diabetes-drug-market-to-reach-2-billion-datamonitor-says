China’s market for diabetes-related
drugs will almost triple over the next decade, spurred by
increased prevalence of the disease, Datamonitor Group said.  The London-based research company estimates that the value
of the overall diabetes pharmaceutical market in China will
increase to $2 billion in 2019 from $0.7 billion last year,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  “The sales uptake is not only driven by the soaring
patients’ numbers but also the increasing health-care insurance
coverage and the launch of many novel antidiabetic products such
as dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists,” Datamonitor said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
