QR National Ltd. will test the
appetite for Australian share-market debuts today after
Queensland state raised A$4.63 billion ($4.57 billion) from the
coal-train operator’s initial public offering.  Queensland said Nov. 20 it priced shares in Australia’s
second-largest IPO at A$2.55 each, near the bottom of an 
indicated range of A$2.50 to A$3. QR National stock will start
trading at noon in Sydney.   “The fact that they have got it away is a positive since
there had been a lot of talk that it would get re-priced,” said
 Chris Weston , an institutional dealer at IG Markets in Melbourne.
“We might see a little bit of upside for the stock given that a
lot of institutions didn’t get their full allocation, so they
may be looking to buy some on open.”  Bilfinger Berger AG, Germany’s second-largest construction
company, pulled the A$1.39 billion initial public offering of
its Australian unit Valemus Ltd. in July and Karoon Gas
Australia Ltd., an oil and gas explorer, canceled a Brazilian
offering last week, citing an unfavorable market. Shares of Myer
Holdings Ltd., which raised A$2.1 billion in 2009, trade below
their offer price.  The QR National sale included A$4.05 billion in IPO
proceeds, an A$80 million dividend and A$500 million for a debt
facility arranged by the rail operator, Treasurer  Andrew Fraser 
said in Brisbane two days ago.  ‘Right Time’  Retail investors bought 34 percent of the shares and
institutional investors 66 percent. Retail investors will
receive a 10 cent discount, meaning they pay A$2.45 a share.  Queensland is targeting A$15 billion from asset sales to
replace lost revenue and regain its AAA credit rating. The state
government will keep a stake of as much as 40 percent in QR
National and plans to sell this down after the rail company’s
2012 results, it said in an e-mailed statement.  “These proceeds will now be used to pay off debt and
establish a stronger balance sheet,” Premier  Anna Bligh  said.
“Now is the right time for QR National to be backed by private
investment.”  QR National will have an A$6.22 billion market value at
listing, according to the Queensland statement. Stock exchange
operator  ASX Ltd.  is valued at A$6.57 billion, while  Qantas
Airways Ltd.  is worth A$6.03 billion, according to Bloomberg
data.  The Australian government sold one third of Telstra Corp.
for A$14.3 billion in 1997, the nation’s biggest public share
sale.  Coal Shipments  Brisbane-based QR National  operates  700 locomotives, 16,000
wagons and 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) of track across
Australia, according to a share sale document.  Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch & Co. unit, Credit
Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG are the QR National offer
managers.  The company expects earnings to surge 75 percent in the
next two years as coal shipments rise and mining companies
expand projects in Western Australia state.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization are set to increase 42 percent to A$894 million in
the 12 months ending June 2011, the company said in the IPO
prospectus on Oct. 11. Earnings may rise 23 percent in the
following year, the document showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
