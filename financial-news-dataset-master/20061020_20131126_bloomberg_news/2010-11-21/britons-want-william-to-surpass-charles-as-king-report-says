Britons want  Prince William , second
in line to the throne, to surpass his father  Prince Charles  and
be the country’s next king, according a poll published in the
News of the World newspaper.  About 64 percent of respondents in an ICM Research survey
of 2,015 Britons said they want William, the grandson of  Queen Elizabeth II  and son of the late  Diana, Princess of Wales , and
his fiancée  Kate Middleton  to be the nation’s next king and
queen, the News of the World reported today. A separate Yougov
Plc poll published in the Sunday Times today found 56 percent
said William would be a better king than Charles.  ICM carried out its poll between Nov. 17 and Nov. 19, the
News of the World said. The Sunday Times didn’t give details
about the number of participants in Yougov’s survey or the dates
of when it was conducted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
