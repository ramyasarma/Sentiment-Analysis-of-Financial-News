Vestas Wind Systems A/S  declined in
Copenhagen trading for the first time in seven days after the
world’s largest maker of wind turbines forecast sales and
profitability will be unchanged next year.  The stock fell 9.5 kroner, or 5.3 percent, to close at
169.20 kroner. That brought the year-to-date loss to 47 percent.
The shares earlier traded as low as 165 kroner, the least in
four years.  Vestas expects 2010 revenue of 6.8 billion euros ($9.3
billion) and an earnings ratio before interest and tax of 7
percent of sales, when adjusting for costs from job cuts and
closing plants, according to a new accounting policy published
today. Sales and Ebit margin in 2011 will be “at the same
level” as this year, the Randers, Denmark-based company said.  “It looks a bit weaker than I had expected for 2011,”
 Jacob Pedersen , an analyst at Sydbank A/S, said by telephone.
“One could have expected higher profitability next year given
the drastic cost-cut measures that Vestas is carrying out.”  Vestas said in October it will fire 3,000 workers and close
factories in Denmark and Sweden as demand falls. The credit
crisis has prompted banks to restrict loans to developers that
buy turbines from Vestas and rivals such as Germany’s Siemens AG
and General Electric Co. Europe’s sovereign debt crisis has also
limited prospects for economic growth in the region.  “The reason must be that Vestas’ profitability is under
pressure from lower contract prices and at the same time,
capacity is probably still not utilized,” said Pedersen, who
rates the shares an “overweight.”  Ebit Adjustment  Vestas didn’t provide a non-adjusted 2010 Ebit margin for
2010. The costs related to job cuts and factory closings will be
140 million euros to 160 million euros, Vestas said. They will
be booked this quarter and won’t lower the Ebit margin in 2011.  The company kept its 2011 forecast for new orders at 7,000
megawatts to 8,000 megawatts in capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
