A  Delta Air Lines  Inc. plane bound
for Moscow from New York returned to John F. Kennedy
International Airport after flames were seen coming from the
plane, CNN reported.  Bystanders called local officials, saying they saw part of
the plane on fire after it took off. The plane landed safely,
CNN said.  Delta Flight 30 may have had more than 200 passengers on
board, the network said.  The pilot dumped fuel before returning to the airport, CNN
said.  A spokesman for Delta Air didn’t immediately return a phone
call to Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
