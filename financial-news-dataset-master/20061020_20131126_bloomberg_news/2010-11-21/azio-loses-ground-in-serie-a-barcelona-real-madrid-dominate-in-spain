Lazio lost ground in Italian
soccer’s title race with a 1-1 draw at Parma yesterday that left
it three points behind leader AC Milan.  Hernan Crespo  gave Parma a 23rd-minute lead against his
former team.  Sergio Floccari ’s header was then deflected in by
Parma defender Luca Antonelli just before halftime.  AC Milan tops the Serie A standings with 29 points after
beating Fiorentina 1-0 two days ago. Napoli moved up two places
to third with a 4-1 home victory over Bologna last night.  Defending champion Inter Milan is nine points off the lead
in sixth place after losing 2-1 at Chievo. Sergio Pellissier and
Davide Moscardelli put the home team 2-0 up and  Samuel Eto ’o got
a last-minute goal for Inter, whose coach  Rafael Benitez  faces
increasing media speculation over his position.  Real Madrid and champion Barcelona continue to dominate in
Spain after scoring 13 goals between them two days ago.  Lionel Messi  got three goals in Barca’s 8-0 rout of Almeria,
while  Cristiano Ronaldo  also got a hat trick in Real’s 5-1 win
over Athletic Bilbao.  Real Madrid, with 32 points, will take a one-point lead
over Barcelona into their Nov. 29 meeting at Barca’s Camp Nou
stadium. Third-place Villarreal has 24 points after a 1-1 draw
with Valencia.  Borussia Dortmund leads Germany’s Bundesliga by seven
points after a 2-1 win at Freiburg two days ago. Second-place
Mainz won 3-2 at Borussia Moenchengladbach.  Former Real Madrid striker Raul scored three goals as
Schalke defeated Werder Bremen 4-0. It was only the third league
win for Schalke this season.  Cologne moved off the bottom of the table with a 1-0 win at
Stuttgart yesterday thanks to  Lukas Podolski ’s penalty.  Lille went top of the French standings after a 2-1 victory
over Monaco yesterday. Montpellier, a 1-0 winner at Nice a day
earlier, is level on points and has an inferior goal difference.  In the Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven drew 0-0 at Ajax two days
ago and has a three-point lead over FC Twente. Groningen, which
beat Feyenoord 2-0, is a point further back.  WEEKEND RESULTS:
