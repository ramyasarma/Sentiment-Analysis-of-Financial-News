England’s  Ian Poulter  won golf’s
Hong Kong Open today by one stroke to secure his second title of
the year.  The 10th European Tour title of the 34-year-old’s career
will lift him back into the top 10 of the world rankings, after
he started the event at No. 14.  “I’m not playing the game saying, ‘I’m going to get to No.
1,’ I tried that once before and it didn’t work,” Poulter told
reporters. “I think I’ll just try winning next week and see how
high I can go.”  Poulter finished on 22-under-par, one shot ahead of
countryman  Simon Dyson  and Italy’s Matteo Manassero, who had a
final-round 8-under 62.  Poulter, who held on even after a bogey at the last hole,
collects a check for 301,447 euros ($412,168). That takes him to
1,983,142 euros in the Race to Dubai money list, where he’s in
fifth spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
