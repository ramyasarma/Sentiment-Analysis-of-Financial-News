Nigeria plans to upgrade and expand
its 210,000-barrel Port Harcourt oil refinery, the country’s
biggest, according to an official of the state-owned national
oil company.  “What we want to do is to undertake a different type of
turnaround maintenance that will guarantee maximum benefit,”
 Austen Oniwon , group managing director of the state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The NNPC is “going back to the original contractors who
built all the units” to ensure “an effective and total
refurbishment of the plant,” Oniwon said.  The two units of the Port Harcourt refinery were built by
Spibat of France and the Japan Gasoline Corp., according to the
NNPC.  Nigeria has four refineries with a combined capacity of
445,000 barrels a day. All four units are currently operating at
about 30 percent of total capacity, according to the Department
of Petroleum Resources. The refineries are unable to operate at
full capacity because of ageing equipment and poor maintenance.
That has forced Nigeria to depend on imports to meet its
refined-fuel requirements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
