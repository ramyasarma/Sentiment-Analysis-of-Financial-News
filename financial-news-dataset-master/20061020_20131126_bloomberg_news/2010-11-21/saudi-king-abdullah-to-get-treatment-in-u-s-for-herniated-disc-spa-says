Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah bin
Abdulaziz will travel to the U.S. tomorrow for further medical
checks and to receive treatment, the official Saudi Press Agency
announced today.  Doctors advised the 86-year-old monarch to rest after
medical examinations showed a slipped disc had caused a blood
clot that put pressure on his nerves, SPA said yesterday.  The king appeared on state television during the Eid al-
Adha Islamic feast receiving senior officials. He told his
guests that he regretted not being able to stand up to shake
their hands because of his injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
