The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 4.53 cents to $2.8729 a
gallon, according to a survey.  The price covers the two-week period ended Nov. 19 and is
determined from data provided by 2,500 filling stations
nationwide to  Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst
in Camarillo, California.  “The increase came because of the crude oil price hikes
from the prior two-week period,” Lundberg said in an interview.
Oil prices “are within 18 cents of their month-ago level.”  Consumers will likely see little change in prices in the
days surrounding the Nov. 25 Thanksgiving holiday unless crude
oil prices move significantly lower or higher, she said.  “From here on, it seems the most likely scenario will be
stability with very small changes in the U.S. average at the
pump,” Lundberg said.  Crude oil for December delivery slid 6.1 percent in the two
weeks ended Nov. 19, dropping $5.04 to $81.51 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil fell as the dollar
surged 2.5 percent against the euro, reducing the investment
appeal of dollar-denominated commodities.  The January crude oil contract, which becomes the front-
month contract tomorrow, may climb through Nov. 26 amid
speculation Ireland will accept a bailout, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  Price Stability  U.S. crude-oil  supplies  slid 7.29 million barrels to a
nine-week low of 357.6 million in the week ended Nov. 12,
according to the Energy Department. It was the biggest one-week
drop since May 2008. Crude  inventories  at Cushing, Oklahoma, the
delivery point for New York futures, rose 1.27 million, the
biggest increase since April.  Gasoline for December delivery gained 0.7 percent to $2.196
a gallon in the two weeks ended Nov. 19.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  as of Nov. 12 were the lowest in
13 months, according to the Department. Supplies were 6 percent
above the five-year average for the period. Crude oil
inventories were 14 percent above the five-year average.  Demand  for gasoline, as measured by what refiners and
blenders supply to wholesalers fell 1.1 percent to 8.95 million
barrels a day. Averaged over four weeks, consumption was 1.8
percent higher than a year earlier.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump in the week ended Nov. 12
rose 2.4 percent from the prior week, according to  MasterCard
Inc.  in its Nov. 16 SpendingPulse report.  On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $3.13 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.11 a
gallon.  The highest price in the continental U.S. was in San
Francisco at $3.20 a gallon. The cheapest place to buy the fuel
was Denver, where a gallon averaged $2.63, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
