LeSean McCoy ’s 50-yard touchdown run
with 4:34 remaining lifted the Philadelphia Eagles to a 27-17
win over the New York Giants that leaves them alone in first
place atop their division.  On a fourth-and-one play, Eagles quarterback  Michael Vick 
bobbled the snap from center and then pitched to McCoy as he was
tackled by the Giants’  Osi Umenyiora . McCoy raced to the outside
and went untouched to the end zone to put the Eagles back in
front after they blew a 16-3 lead at Lincoln Financial Field.  Vick added a four-yard touchdown run and  David Akers  kicked
four field goals as the Eagles improved to 7-3 on the National
Football League season with their third straight win.
Philadelphia has a one-game lead in the NFC’s East Division over
the Giants, who fell to 6-4 and have lost two straight.  “That was big go-ahead in the division,” Vick said during
a news conference. “It says a lot about the guys in the locker
room and a lot about our organization.”  Giants quarterback  Eli Manning  threw three interceptions
and also lost a fumble at the Eagles’ 40-yard line with 2:51
remaining. He had four of New York’s five turnovers.  The Eagles’ win capped a day in which the New York Jets
beat the Houston Texans 30-27 on a six-yard touchdown catch by
 Santonio Holmes  with 10 seconds left. The New England Patriots
then tied the Jets atop the American Football Conference’s East
Division with a 31-28 win over the Indianapolis Colts.  At 8-2, the Jets and Patriots are tied for the NFL’s best
record with the Atlanta Falcons, who beat St. Louis 34-17.  Early Lead  In Philadelphia, the Eagles opened a 16-3 third-quarter
lead even though they were held to one touchdown by the Giants’
defense after piling up a franchise-record 592 yards in last
week’s 59-28 win over Washington.  The Giants, held to 95 yards of offense in the first half,
scored touchdowns on their first two possessions of the second
half to take a 17-16 lead. Manning threw a 2-yard touchdown pass
to  Travis Beckum  and then hooked up with  Derek Hagan  from five
yards out with 13:35 to play.  After getting the ball back with 7:52 left, the Eagles
drove to midfield and faced fourth down. Instead of keeping the
ball in the hands of Vick, who threw four touchdown passes and
ran for two more scores last week, Philadelphia went to McCoy,
who finished with 111 rushing yards on 14 carries.  Manning’s Turnovers  Manning fumbled on the Giants’ next possession, leading to
Akers’s fourth field goal, and threw his third interception of
the game with one second left.  “We have to keep it going, but it feels real good to be
where we are right now,” Eagles defensive end  Brandon Graham 
said in the locker room.  The Jets have won three in a row and are off to their best
start since 1986, when they opened 10-1. Their past five
victories have been decided in the closing minutes, including
overtime wins the previous two weeks.  “I want to apologize to all of the Jets fans for affecting
the heart a little bit, but we’ll take the win,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said during a news conference.  New York built a 23-7 lead at New Meadowlands Stadium in
East Rutherford, New Jersey, before giving up 20 fourth-quarter
points. The Jets then drove 72 yards in 45 seconds for the
winning score, with Sanchez connecting with Holmes in the corner
of the end zone.  Holmes had caught a 37-yard touchdown pass in overtime last
week to give the Jets a 26-20 victory in Cleveland.  Patriots Hold On  In Foxboro, Massachusetts, the Patriots led 31-14 in the
fourth quarter and then withstood a rally by the Colts and
 Peyton Manning , who threw for 396 yards and four touchdowns.  Manning threw two scoring passes to Blair White in the
final eight minutes before being intercepted by  James Sanders  at
the Patriots’ 6-yard line with 31 seconds left. Manning threw
three interceptions for the Colts, who fell to 6-4.  Tom Brady  collected his 25th straight win at Gillette
Stadium, tying the NFL record for most consecutive home wins by
a quarterback set by  Brett Favre  in Green Bay from 1995-98.  The Buffalo Bills rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat
the Cincinnati Bengals 49-31 for their second straight win
following a 0-8 start.  The Dallas Cowboys also won their second in a row, beating
the Detroit Lions 35-19 as  Jon Kitna  threw three touchdown
passes and ran for a score.  7-3 Teams  Aaron Rodgers  threw for four scores as the Green Bay
Packers improved to 7-3 with a 31-3 win over the Minnesota
Vikings. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are also 7-3, with the
Steelers defeating the Oakland Raiders 35-3 and the Ravens
beating the Carolina Panthers 37-13.  Elsewhere in Week 11 of the NFL season, it was Jacksonville
24, Cleveland 20; Kansas City 31, Arizona 13; Tampa Bay 21, San
Francisco 0; New Orleans 34, Seattle 19; and Washington 19,
Tennessee 16 in overtime. Chicago beat Miami 16-0 four days ago.  San Diego hosts Denver tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
