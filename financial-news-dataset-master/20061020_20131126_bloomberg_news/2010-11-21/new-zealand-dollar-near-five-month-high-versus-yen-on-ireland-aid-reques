The Australian dollar rose to a one-
week high against the greenback on speculation Ireland’s request
for a bailout to help fund itself and save its banks will boost
demand for growth-sensitive currencies.  New Zealand’s dollar gained to a six-month high against the
yen after Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said he expects talks
on the package to be completed in the “next few weeks.” The
New Zealand dollar climbed to the highest in more than a week
against the greenback before a U.S. report tomorrow forecast to
show a slowdown in existing home sales. The two South Pacific
nations’ currencies also rose as Asian stocks advanced.  The Irish aid request “should be a positive” for risk
appetite, said  Phil Burke , chief dealer for global foreign
exchange and rates at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney. “The euro
traded half a cent higher this morning than the New York close.
That has helped the Aussie and kiwi.”  Australia’s dollar gained to 99.37 U.S. cents as of 1:17
p.m. in Sydney from 98.66 in New York on Nov. 19. It touched
99.45 U.S. cents, the highest since Nov. 12. The so-called
Aussie rose to 82.87 yen from 82.41 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar gained to 65.32 yen from 65.07 yen. It
earlier touched 65.38 yen, the highest since May 17. The kiwi
advanced to 78.31 U.S. cents from 77.87 cents, after reaching
78.37, the strongest since Nov. 11.  Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said the loan will be
less than 100 billion euros ($138 billion). He refused to give
any further details at a press conference in Dublin yesterday.  U.S. Data  Demand for the greenback was limited before the U.S.
housing data. Sales of existing homes fell 1.1 percent to a 4.48
million annual rate last month from 4.53 million in September,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey before the National Association of Realtors reports
the data tomorrow.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the euro,
yen and pound, dropped 0.5 percent to 78.14.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares advanced 0.6
percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.5 percent.  Gains in the New Zealand and Australian dollars were
tempered after China ordered banks to set aside larger reserves
for the second time in two weeks, draining cash from the
financial system to limit inflation and asset-bubble risks.  China’s Tightening  The requirement will increase 50 basis points starting Nov.
29, the central bank said on its website on Nov. 19. The aim is
to step up liquidity management and “appropriately control”
credit and loans, it said.  Investors should buy Australia’s dollar under 95 U.S. cents,
betting on gains next year, said  Grant Turley , a senior currency
strategist with Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  “The risk that we get down to those levels is really on
the back of concerns about China,” Turley said. “People are
trimming their expectations of bulk commodity demand in the
short-run just on these reserve requirement hikes.”  Australia is the world’s largest exporter of iron ore and
coal and counts China as its biggest trading partner.  The yield on Australia’s 10-year note rose two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.5 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed
payment made to receive floating rates, rose to 4.035 percent
from 4.015 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
