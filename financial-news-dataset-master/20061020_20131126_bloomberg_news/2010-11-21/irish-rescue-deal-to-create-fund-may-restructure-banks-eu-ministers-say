European Union finance ministers
said a rescue agreement for Ireland will create a capital fund
for the country’s banks and may end up “restructuring” the
financial industry.   “The programme will also include a fund for potential
future capital needs of the banking sector,” the finance
ministers said in an e-mailed statement after a conference call
today. “By building on the measures already taken by Ireland to
address stress in its banking sector, a comprehensive range of
measures –- including deleveraging and restructuring of the
banking sector –- will contribute to ensuring that the banking
system performs its role in the functioning of the economy.”  The U.K. and Sweden said they stand ready to provide a
bilateral loan, the statement said.   The rescue agreement will “build on” Ireland’s four-year
plan to cut its budget, to be announced later this week, the
statement said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
