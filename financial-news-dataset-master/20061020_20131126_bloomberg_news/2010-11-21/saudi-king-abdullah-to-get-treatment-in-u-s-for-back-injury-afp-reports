Saudi Arabia’s  King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz  will travel to the U.S. tomorrow to receive medical
treatment for a herniated spinal disc.  The monarch will travel on the recommendation of his
doctors that he be examined and treated, the state-run Saudi
Press Agency  reported  today. Physicians advised 86-year-old King
Abdullah to rest after tests last week showed the slipped disc
had caused a blood clot that put pressure on some nerves, the
official news agency reported on Nov. 19.  The king “is in good health and in stable condition,” and
the nation should feel assured of his recovery, Saudi Arabia’s
Health Minister Abdullah Al Rabeeah said in an interview with
Saudi television today.  King Abdullah became the country’s de-facto ruler in 1996
after a stroke incapacitated his brother, the late  King Fahd . He
has been less active since undergoing overseas medical
treatments in 2008 and 2009, Agence France-Presse reported
today.  Born in 1924, Abdullah is the 13th son of  King Abdulaziz ,
the kingdom’s founder, according to the website of the Saudi
Embassy in Washington.  Abdullah’s half-brother,  Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz ,
who himself has travelled frequently in the past year for
medical treatment, returned today after spending several weeks
in Morocco, SPA reported.  The king’s trip to the U.S. was reported earlier today by
AFP, which cited an unnamed Saudi official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
