             The crime drama “Takers” was the
top film in U.S. and Canadian theaters over the weekend, earning
$20.5 million for  Sony Corp.   
 The film moved into first place after final Sunday sales
numbers were tallied, displacing “The Last Exorcism,”
researcher Hollywood.com Box Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. “The Last Exorcism” took in $20.4 million.  
 “Takers” features singer  Chris Brown  and  Hayden Christensen  leading a group of bank robbers chased by a veteran
detective played by  Matt Dillon . “The Last Exorcism,” along
with “Takers,” had an unexpectedly strong opening weekend for
late August, said  Gitesh Pandya , chief executive officer of Box
Office Guru.com.  
 “The end of August is a dumping ground for weak movies
that don’t work,” Pandya said. “It shows that there’s still a
lot of interest out there in moviegoers to see something
different.”  
 “The Last Exorcism,” from  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. ,
was filmed as a mock documentary and doesn’t feature a Hollywood
superstar. Rated PG-13, the movie depicts a camera crew assigned
to follow a preacher performing his final exorcism before
quitting the practice.  
 “The Expendables,” also from Lions Gate, finished third
with $9.5 million after two weeks at No. 1. The film, directed
by and starring  Sylvester Stallone , follows a group of
mercenaries paid to overthrow a South American dictator. The
cast includes  Jet Li ,  Mickey Rourke ,  Jason Statham  and  Steve Austin . It has taken in $82 million since opening on Aug. 13.  
 ‘Eat Pray Love’  
 “Eat Pray Love,” featuring  Julia Roberts , dropped to
fourth place from third in its third week of release with $6.8
million for  Sony Corp.  Roberts plays Elizabeth Gilbert, who
wrote a memoir detailing her divorce and world travels.  
 “The Other Guys” remained in fifth with $6.3 million. The
buddy-cop spoof starring  Will Ferrell  and  Mark Wahlberg  has
earned $99 million for Sony in four weeks.  
 “Vampires Suck” was sixth with $5.2 million for  News
Corp.’s  Fox studio. The movie parodies the recent vampire
phenomenon, specifically Summit Entertainment LLC’s “Twilight”
series.  
 The rereleased “Avatar” had $4 million in sales,
finishing in 11th place. The take pushed the movie’s domestic
total to $753.8 million. The 3-D film from director  James Cameron  originally was released in December.  
 Next Week’s Debuts  
 Three films debut next week, including the Wednesday
opening of  George Clooney’s  “The American” from NBC
Universal’s Focus Features. Warner Bros. will attempt to draw in
romantic-comedy fans with “Going the Distance,” starring  Drew Barrymore  and  Justin Long ,, while Fox’s “Machete” targets the
adventure seekers.  
 Weekend sales for the top 12 films fell 8.5 percent to
$100.4 million from $109.8 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com
said. Year-to-date receipts total $7.53 billion, up 4.1 percent
from $7.23 billion. Attendance has fallen 1.5 percent this year.

Angeles-based Hollywood.com. The amounts are based on actual
