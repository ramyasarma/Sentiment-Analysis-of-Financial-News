U.S. sugar output will be cut by
about 20 percent next year if farmers can’t plant genetically
modified beets, as ruled by a federal judge in August, the
Department of Agriculture said in a court filing.  Beets, which account for about 44 percent of U.S. sugar
output, would lose 1.627 million short tons of production
without a supply of genetically modified seeds produced by
Monsanto Co., USDA economist Daniel Colacicco said in an
analysis made for the case. The  department’s 10-year production
forecast  made in February was for a crop of 7.649 million tons
next year.  “The limited availability of conventional seed will
severely restrict plantings of sugar beets in 2011,” Colacicco
wrote in his report. The impact of smaller beet-sugar supply
would be “severe,” although it may be mitigated by imports and
substitution of other sweeteners, he wrote.  About 95 percent of the U.S. sugar-beet crop is genetically
modified, according to the document.  U.S. District Judge  Jeffrey S. White  revoked the
government’s approval of the seeds, saying the USDA hadn’t
properly considered the potential environmental impact.  The Agriculture Department said Sept. 1 that it plans to
have interim rules governing genetically modified sugar beets in
place by the end of the year.  The case is Center for Food Safety v. Vilsack, 10-04038,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
