             ValueClick Inc. (VCLK)  may have several
potential suitors interested in acquiring the second-biggest
Internet advertising broker, including  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , according
to ThinkEquity Partners LLC. The shares rallied to a record.  
 ``We believe multiple suitors now await to acquire
ValueClick, the last digital advertising asset with substantial
scale and footprint, at a meaningful premium,'' ThinkEquity
analyst Stewart Barry wrote in a note to investors.  
 Barry said the ``long list'' of interested buyers may
include  Google Inc. (GOOG) , Yahoo! Inc., Time Warner Inc.,  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ,
 IAC/InteractiveCorp. (IACI) , and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.  
 He said Microsoft should consider acquiring  Westlake
Village , California-based ValueClick because it would
``complement'' the biggest software company's May 18 acquisition
of aQuantive Inc.  
 Google, Yahoo and Time Warner may seek to acquire ValueClick
to expand their own publisher ad networks and to prevent each
other and Microsoft from owning it, the San Francisco-based
analyst wrote.  
 IAC/InterActiveCorp, EBay,  News Corp. (NWSA) , and Experian Group
Ltd. may also bid ``to avoid being shut out with the last large-scale digital advertising property on the line,'' Barry said.  
 On May 2, Westlake Village, California-based ValueClick said
first-quarter profit almost doubled on demand from customers that
hire the company to run e-mail marketing and other direct-sales
campaigns.  
 Barry raised his share-price forecast for ValueClick by $6
to $43 and maintained a ``buy'' rating.  
 ValueClick shares jumped $4.28, or 14 percent, to $34.28 at
2:23 p.m. in  Nasdaq Stock Market (AMZN)  composite trading, the largest
rally since August 2006.  
 Options  
 Microsoft's agreement to buy aQuantive on May 18 was
followed by a jump in trading of options to buy shares of
ValueClick. The number of call options traded in ValueClick
surged to 23,502 that day, the most ever and more than 14 times
the average of 1,661 in the preceding 20 days.  
 Call options give investors the right, without the
obligation, to buy shares of a company at a specified price by a
given date.  
 While the underlying stock gained 7.6 percent to $30 on May
18, an option to buy ValueClick shares for $35 by June 16 jumped
more than sixfold to $1.
