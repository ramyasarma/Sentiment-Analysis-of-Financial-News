A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S is close to
ordering as many as 20 of the largest container ships ever
built,  TradeWinds  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Each vessel would be able to transport the equivalent of
18,000 twenty-foot boxes, compared with the 15,000 that the
largest vessels operating now can haul, the shipping-industry
newspaper said on its website today.  The vessels would cost $200 million each and may be powered
by liquefied natural gas, according to TradeWinds. The initial
order would be for 10 of the ships, with an option for 10 more,
it said.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , Samsung Heavy Industries Co.,
Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co. and Daewoo
Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. have been approached and
are said to have already reserved space to build the carriers,
TradeWinds reported.  Daewoo Shipbuilding said today “nothing has been
finalized” after a local newspaper reported that Maersk is in
talks with the South Korean shipyard to order new ships. The
company didn’t say in the filing whether it was in talks with
the shipping line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
