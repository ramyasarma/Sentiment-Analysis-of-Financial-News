Inditex SA , the world’s largest
clothing retailer, fell the most in two months in Madrid trading
after Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the stock
citing the effects of austerity measures on consumer spending.  Inditex  dropped as much as 2.9 percent, the most since
Sept. 27, and traded at 58.70 euros, down 2 percent, at 9:37
a.m. The Arteixo, Spain-based retailer has a market value of
36.6 billion euros ($48.6 billion).  “We foresee a lack of earnings momentum as we head into
next year, as austerity starts to bite in southern Europe,”
which accounts for more than 40 percent of  Inditex’s sales ,
 Richard Chamberlain , an analyst at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, wrote in a note. “Inditex’s fairly high market shares in
southern Europe mean that it will not be immune to macro
pressures.” Chamberlain cut his rating on the stock to
“neutral” from “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
