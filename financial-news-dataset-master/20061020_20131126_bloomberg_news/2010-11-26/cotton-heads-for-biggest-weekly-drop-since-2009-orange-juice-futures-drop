Cotton futures tumbled in New York,
capping the biggest weekly drop since February 2009, as China
broadened efforts to curb speculative trading in farm products
and cool inflation. Orange juice also fell.  China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy and
biggest cotton user, has pledged to control  prices  and may raise
interest rates again to limit inflation. Guotai Junan Securities
Co. predicted as many as three increases in borrowing costs by
June 30. Cotton prices have dropped 26 percent from a record on
Nov. 10.  “The government has definitely taken on a tough-love
approach to get inflation under control,” said  Sharon Johnson ,
a senior analyst at Penson Futures in Atlanta.  Cotton for March delivery dropped 4.83 cents, or 4.1
percent, to settle at $1.1176 a pound at 1:09 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price fell by the
exchange limit of 5 cents. This week, the fiber dropped 9.2
percent, the most since February 2009.  The all-time high on Nov. 10 was $1.5195. Futures have
gained 48 percent this year.  The U.S.  exported  266,010 bales of upland cotton in the
week ended Nov. 18, down 46 percent from the previous week, the
Department of Agriculture said today. A bale weighs about 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “The short-term trend is still pointing lower,”  Peter Egli , the director of risk management in Chicago for Plexus
Cotton Ltd., a U.K.-based merchant, said in a report.  In China, cotton for September delivery fell as much as the
5 percent daily limit to 24,320 yuan a metric ton on the
Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange.  ‘Clamp Down Strictly’  The National Development and Reform Commission in China,
the top economic planning agency, said yesterday that commodity
prices declined in response to the government’s moves to “clamp
down strictly on market manipulation and other illegal activity,
and curb excessive speculation.”  China’s cotton output may fall 5.5 percent this year to
6.36 million metric tons after rain and cold weather damaged
crops, according to Cncotton.com, a research company.  Demand in China is forecast to outpace supplies by 17
million bales in the year ending July 31, the USDA said on Nov.
9. Stockpiles in the U.S. are predicted to fall to 2.2 million
bales this season, down 25 percent from 2.95 million last year.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery fell 1.2 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $1.5135 a pound in New York. The price
dropped 0.2 percent this week and is up 32 percent in the past
12 months.  U.S. markets were closed yesterday for the Thanksgiving
holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
