Suntech Power Holdings Co. , the
world’s largest solar panel maker, aims to increase shipments
next year by about 30 percent to meet demand from markets
including Europe, Chief Executive Officer  Shi Zhengrong  said.  “Next year looks very encouraging,” Shi said in an
interview in Sydney today, adding that demand is also expected
to rise in the U.S. and Japan. “So far the market looks good.”  Suntech expects to ship more than 1.5 gigawatts of solar
panels in 2010, more than double 2009 shipments, the Wuxi,
China-based producer said Nov. 17. The company is targeting
annual production capacity of 1.8 gigawatts by the year-end.  The solar panel maker got 74 percent of its  revenue  from
Europe last year, 9.5 percent from the U.S. and 4.8 percent from
Japan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Suntech, with
Sydney-based  Infigen Energy , is seeking funding from the
Australian government’s A$1.5 billion solar program to build
plants in New South Wales, its first solar farms in the country.  The joint proposal is one of four solar photovoltaic
projects selected in May to advance in the competition for
funding.  AGL Energy Ltd. , BP Plc and TRUenergy Holdings Pty Ltd.
are also finalists. The government decision is due in the first
half of 2011.  Suntech  rose 3.8 percent to $7.39 in New York trading on
Nov. 24. The shares have dropped about 56 percent this year.  The proposed solar farms in Australia require government
funds, Shi said.  “Maybe in a couple of years, when costs continue to drop
we will be able to build a big solar plant in Australia without
government subsidies,” said Shi, who joined actress  Cate Blanchett  at the Sydney Theatre Co. to mark the start of a
rooftop solar power system using Suntech panels.  Australia, where coal accounts for more than 80 percent of
electricity production, has set a target of generating 20
percent of its power from wind, solar, geothermal and other
renewable energy sources by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
