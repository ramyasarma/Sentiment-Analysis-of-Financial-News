The New York town of Southampton, a
summer hotspot for Wall Street investment bankers and Hollywood
stars, overpaid more than $1.91 million in lieu of taxes to two
Long Island school districts, Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said.  Southampton gave $8.29 million to schools in the eastern
end of Long Island, when the amount should have been $7.62
million, DiNapoli said today in a  statement , citing an audit of
payments made on tax-exempt property by the seaside town. He
said it underpaid a third system and three fire districts.  “When governments and municipalities make mistakes,
taxpayers suffer,” DiNapoli said. The error stemmed from a
misinterpretation of a 2007 change in the law under which towns
make payments in lieu of taxes, DiNapoli said.  The town of about 55,200, frequented by billionaire
investor  George Soros  and movie stars  Renee Zellweger  and
 Michael J. Fox , could have saved about $664,600 over the two
years that were examined, according to DiNapoli’s audit. The
biggest overpayment, of $1.76 million, went to the Riverhead
Central School District, DiNapoli said.  In its official response, the town said it would develop a
“corrective action plan.” Southampton officials couldn’t be
reached immediately today for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
