Kenya, East Africa’s biggest
economy, needs to invest $500 million by 2014 to upgrade and
expand its electricity grid to reduce power cuts, said  Patrick Nyoike , permanent secretary in the energy ministry.  The government has already raised 16 billion shillings
($199 million), which it has given to the  Kenya Power & Lighting
Ltd. , the nation’s sole electricity distributor, Nyoike said.
Additional funds will be raised from the company’s rights offer,
which begins today, he told reporters in Nairobi, the capital.  KPLC, as the company is known, will raise about 9.1 billion
shillings through its capital reorganization, Managing Director
 Joseph Njoroge  said on Nov. 19.  The company is converting preference stock to ordinary
shares, issuing new shares and splitting its stock, increasing
the number of its shares to 1.73 billion from 79.13 million.  Upgrading the power distribution system will increase per
capita consumption of electricity to 300 kilowatt hours per year
from 144 kilowatt hours, Nyoike said. Kenya currently has an
average of 6,000 power cuts per month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
