Spain faces a test as its banks and
government seek to raise a combined 73 billion euros ($97
billion) in the first four months of 2011 and the markets treat
them “as one” after Ireland’s bailout, Barclays Capital said.  “In our view, the renewed focus will now be on Spain,
where spring 2011 looks tricky,”  Simon Samuels  and  Mike Harrison , London-based analysts at Barclays, wrote in a report
dated today. “This is a big test of investor appetite for
exposure (government and bank) to Spain, especially if there are
renewed concerns about credit quality.”  After Ireland sought a bailout triggered by a funding
crisis for its lenders, investors are now treating government
and banks as “synonyms,” and analysis of their funding needs
has to treat “the two issuers as one,” they wrote in their
report. That means the 30 billion euros needed by the Spanish
government and more than 40 billion needed by banks looks
demanding, they said in a note published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
