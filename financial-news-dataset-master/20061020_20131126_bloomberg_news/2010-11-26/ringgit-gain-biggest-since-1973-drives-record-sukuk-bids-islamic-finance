Malaysia’s Islamic bond auctions
drew record bids this year as issuance fell and the strongest
currency rally since 1973 drove fund inflows.  The finance ministry will offer 3 billion ringgit ($950
million) of 10-year Shariah-compliant bonds on Nov. 29 to
complete its local-debt sale program. Demand for sukuk exceeded
the amount offered by 2.4 times this year, the highest ratio
since data became available in 1999. While sukuk returns have
lagged emerging-market debt, this has been more than offset by
the ringgit’s 8.8 percent rally this year, the second-best
performance among Asia’s major currencies excluding the yen.  “There’s excess liquidity of about 30 billion ringgit in
the local market on a daily basis, while a stronger ringgit is
spurring demand from overseas buyers,”  Nor Alfian Din , head of
currency trading at Maybank Islamic Bhd., a unit of Malaysia’s
biggest lender, said in a Nov. 24 interview from Kuala Lumpur.  Next week’s offering will take sukuk sales by the
government to 23.4 billion ringgit, compared with 33.5 billion
ringgit last year, according to central bank statistics. The
government is borrowing less as the economy recovers from its
first contraction in a decade in 2009. Malaysia is aiming to cut
the budget deficit to 5.6 percent of gross domestic product from
a 22-year high of 7 percent last year.  The ringgit touched a 13-year high of 3.0775 on Nov. 5 as
offshore investors sought higher-yielding emerging-market
assets. The central bank has eased foreign exchange regulations
a few times since ending a seven-year peg to the dollar in July
2005.  Ringgit Attraction  “Malaysia is still one of my favorite stories,” said
 Patrick Bengzon , who helps manage $11.8 billion at Jyske Bank
A/S in Silkeborg, Denmark. “Strong growth figures and the
country’s low indebtedness” make the ringgit attractive, he
said.  Fund managers including AmInvestment Management Sdn., Areca
Capital Sdn. and Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd. said they may bid
for the 10-year sukuk. The securities may yield between 3.95
percent and 4.3 percent, based on a Bloomberg News survey of six
banks on Nov. 24.  “The currency will be the main attraction for that kind of
money,”  Danny Wong , who manages 400 million ringgit of assets
as chief executive officer of Areca Capital, said in an
interview from Kuala Lumpur yesterday. Wong said he will buy the
new sukuk at a 4.3 percent yield.  Foreign Ownership Climbs  Foreign  ownership  of ringgit-denominated government bonds
climbed to 68 billion ringgit at the end of September, 66
percent more than at the end of last year, according to central
bank data. Offshore investors lifted holdings of Shariah-
compliant sukuk to 413 million ringgit, up from 146 million
ringgit at the end of 2009.  “Investors need to park their money in good-quality
assets,” said Nor. “Europe isn’t a place for you to be right
now, so money will keep flowing into this region.”  The 10-year sukuk was last traded to yield 4.01 percent on
a pre-auction basis, according to broker Amanah Butler Sdn. in
Kuala Lumpur. The auction may attract demand that’s less than
two times the amount on offer, the Bloomberg survey shows.
Malaysia’s government has never experienced under-
subscription in any of its 130 debt auctions since data began in
1999.  The existing 4.284 percent sukuk due June 2020 has handed
investors a 3.5 percent gain since the notes were sold on June
15, through yesterday, compared with the 3.6 percent gain in
benchmark 10-year non-Islamic bonds, according to Bloomberg
data.  Sukuk Issuance Falls  Global sales of Islamic bonds, which are backed by assets
or cash flows to comply with Shariah’s ban on interest, fell 31
percent to $13.7 billion this year from the year-earlier period,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Issuance of ringgit-denominated
sukuk dropped 32 percent to 21.4 billion ringgit, the data show.  The yield on Malaysia’s 3.928 percent Islamic note due June
2015 was unchanged at 2.89 percent, according to prices provided
by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The extra yield investors
demand to hold Dubai’s government sukuk rather than Malaysia’s
narrowed one basis point today to 379, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Global Shariah-compliant bonds have returned 5.2 percent
since June 30, according to the  HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US Dollar
Sukuk Index , compared with an 8.2 percent gain for bonds in
developing markets, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global
Diversified Index shows. The  difference  between the average
yield for sukuk and the London interbank offered rate widened
nine basis points this week to 344 basis points, the HSBC
indices show. It has narrowed 17 basis points this month.  Malaysia accounts for more than half of the $130 billion of
outstanding Islamic bonds, Bloomberg data show. The country has
337.6 billion ringgit of Shariah-compliant banking assets, or 20
percent of the total, the Finance Ministry said in its 2010-2011
economic report in October.  “Malaysia is politically very stable,” Azdini  Nor Azman ,
the head of fixed-income at Bank Muamalat Malaysia, said in a
Nov. 24 interview in Kuala Lumpur. “It continues to benefit
from the global inflow of funds into emerging markets.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
