MIE Holdings Corp.,  a Beijing-based
operator of oilfields in China, is planning an initial public
offering in Hong Kong after postponing a U.S. sale in May, two
people familiar with the plan said.  MIE, operating in China’s Songliao basin, will seek to
raise as much as $200 million in an IPO on Hong Kong’s main 
board next month, said one of the people, who declined to be 
identified because the information is private. MIE managers 
will meet potential investors in Hong Kong on Nov. 29, 
according to the other person.  MIE postponed its $96 million U.S. offering in May, after
investors rejected its American depositary receipts at the
reduced price of $7 to $8 apiece. The company had initially
offered the ADRs at $11.50 to $13.50 each.  Bank of China International Holdings Ltd.,  Deutsche Bank AG 
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co . will manage the Hong Kong offering,
according to one of the people. Calls made to MIE’s head office
in Beijing outside normal business hours weren’t answered.  Calls made to Bank of China’s office in Hong Kong outside
of regular business hours weren’t answered. Libby Young, a
spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank in London, and  Brian Marchiony , a
JPMorgan spokesman in London, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
