Mvelaphanda Resources Ltd. , the
company that controls Northam Platinum Ltd., rallied in
Johannesburg after saying an arbitration process that held up
its planned unbundling was favorably resolved.  The  shares  gained 2.53 rand, or 5.5 percent, to 48.25 rand
at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, the biggest gain since May
10. That gives the company a market value of 10.5 billion rand
($1.5 billion).  An arbitrator decided against a claim by former
shareholders of Khumama Platinum Ltd. and awarded costs to
Mvelaphanda, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. The company no longer has any liability in respect of
Khumama, commercial manager  James Wellsted  said by mobile phone.
“We’ll now be proceeding with the unbundling.”  Mvelaphanda is unbundling its remaining shares in  Gold
Fields Ltd.  and a 50.4 percent stake in platinum miner Northam,
and plans to distribute the value of any remaining cash and
assets. The company’s largest shareholder,  Mvelaphanda Group
Ltd.  is also unwinding.  The investment holdings group was started by  Tokyo Sexwale ,
who resigned as chairman of Mvelaphanda Group last year after he
was appointed as South African human settlements minister.  The dispute related to Mvelaphanda’s acquisition of Khumama
in 2004. Khumama had claimed that Mvelaphanda unjustly enriched
itself at the expense of Khumama’s shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
