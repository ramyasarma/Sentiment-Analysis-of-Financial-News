Spanish and Portuguese banks
dropped, led by  Banco Santander SA  and Banco Espirito Santo SA,
on concern the two countries may also need to be bailed out
after Ireland accepted a financial rescue.  Santander, Spain’s biggest bank, dropped 3.6 percent to
7.54 euros at 11:57 a.m. in Madrid, trading 4 percent above its
low this year on June 8 of 7.26 euros. Banco Espirito,
Portugal’s biggest publicly traded bank by market value, fell
1.1 percent to 2.97 euros.  The European Central Bank and a majority of euro-region
states are calling on Portugal to tap the European Financial
Stability Fund in a bid to prevent Spain from also being forced
to do so, the Financial Times Deutschland reported today, citing
unidentified officials at the German Finance Ministry.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding Portugal and
whether it will need a bailout and what that means for Spain,”
 Daragh Quinn , an analyst at Nomura International in Madrid, said
in a telephone interview.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Spain’s second-biggest
lender, dropped 3.7 percent as Bankinter SA fell 4.0 percent and
Banco Popular Espanol SA fell 3.7 percent.  Ireland became the second euro-member country after Greece
to seek a rescue as it struggled to meet the cost of saving its
banks from collapse. That raised speculation whether Portugal
and Spain will be forced to follow suit in a process that some
analysts say may threaten the survival of the euro currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
