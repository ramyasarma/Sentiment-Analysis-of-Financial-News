New York Giants running back  Brandon Jacobs  was fined $20,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct toward fans
during the National Football League team’s 27-17 loss to the
host Philadelphia Eagles on Nov. 21.  After warmups prior to the start of the game, a league
security representative saw Jacobs yelling obscenities and
making an obscene gesture toward the crowd, NFL spokesman
Randall Liu said in an e-mail.  This is the second such violation for Jacobs this season.
On Sept. 21, Jacobs was fined $10,000 for throwing his helmet
into the stands during the Giants’ 38-14 loss to the
Indianapolis Colts. In a letter to Jacobs, NFL executive vice
president of football operations Ray Anderson said “repeated
violations will result in increased disciplinary action, which
may include suspension for conduct detrimental to the league,”
Liu said.  Earlier this week, Jacobs was chosen the Giants’ starting
running back for their Nov. 28 game against the Jacksonville
Jaguars. Jacobs has rushed for 387 yards on 78 carries this
season. He has five touchdowns and one fumble.  To contact the reporter on this story:
