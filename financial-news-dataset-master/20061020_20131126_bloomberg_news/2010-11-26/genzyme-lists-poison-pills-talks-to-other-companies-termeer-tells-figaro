Genzyme Corp., the biotechnology
company being pursued in a hostile takeover by Sanofi-Aventis
SA, has drawn up a list of possible poison pill defensive
measures, while taking no decision on whether to use them, Chief
Executive Officer Henri Termeer told French daily Le Figaro in
an interview.  A conditional price supplement based on the performance of
Campath is a possibility that could be discussed with Sanofi or
other potential bidders, Termeer told Le Figaro. Termeer added
that he’s talking with other companies, while declining to name
them.  Genzyme’s overhaul of production will take three to four
years to complete, Termeer told Le Figaro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
