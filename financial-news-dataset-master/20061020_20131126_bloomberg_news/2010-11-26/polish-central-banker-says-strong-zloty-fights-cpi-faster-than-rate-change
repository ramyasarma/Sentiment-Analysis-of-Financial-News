Polish central banker Adam Glapinski
says strong zloty “acts stronger and faster” in fighting
inflation than interest rate changes, he was cited as saying by
the Polish newswire PAP today.  Any sudden zloty appreciation would be “unfavorable” and
the monetary policy makers shouldn’t provide additional impulse
to attract foreign capital inflow, Glapinski said, PAP reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
