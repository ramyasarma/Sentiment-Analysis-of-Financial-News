Gasoline  barge prices rose during
end of the day trading as a unit at Europe’s largest oil
refinery remained offline for repairs. Royal Dutch Shell Plc
bought jet fuel barges for a fourth day.  Shell delayed the start of a fluid catalytic cracker and a
hydrocracker at its Pernis site until next month, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $763 and $767 a metric ton earlier
in the day, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. During the Platts
pricing window which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London, three trades
took place from $772 to $776 a ton, a separate survey showed.
That compares with deals yesterday from $766 to $773 a ton.  Statoil ASA bought 2,000 tons of the 3,000 tons that
changed hands in the morning. Shell was the other buyer and
Morgan Stanley was the main seller.  Total SA was the main buyer of the afternoon lots. The
trades are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make
finished automotive fuel.  Gasoline’s crack  widened for a third day to $5.60 a barrel,
the highest since Aug. 31, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker in London. That compares with $5.20
yesterday.  Port and refinery protests in France led to a 3 million
barrel deficit of gasoline and 8 million barrel shortfall of
gasoil,  Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at Credit
Agricole CIB, said today in a note.  The strikes in France, which lasted through October, closed
10 of 11 refineries in the region and boosted processing margins
to the highest in two years.  Naphtha’s crack climbed to $2.30 a barrel from $1.80
yesterday, according to PVM. Naphtha is used in gasoline and
petrochemical production.  Middle Distillates  Shell bought 2,000 tons of jet fuel from Deutsche Lufthansa
AG at a premium of $55 a ton to December gasoil traded on
London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, according to the survey of
Platts. That compares with trades yesterday at premiums of $57
and $58 a ton.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel traded three times at a premium of
$21 a ton to December ICE gasoil, the survey showed. That
compares to yesterday’s trades at premiums of $21 and $22 a ton.  Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $5.50 to $6.50 a ton
to the ICE contract, according to the survey. That compares with
yesterday’s trades at discounts of $6 a ton.  Gasoil for December delivery decreased 1 percent to $721.50
a ton as of 5:04 p.m. local time on the ICE exchange. The
January contract fell 0.9 percent to $727 a ton.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profit, shrank to
$12.15 a barrel from $12.32 yesterday, according to ICE. Brent
for January dropped 0.8 percent to $85.44 a barrel on ICE.  Refinery News  A catalytic cracker for gasoline production that was shut
for unplanned work in September at Shell’s Pernis refinery in
Rotterdam had been expected to resume operations in early
November, people with knowledge of the work said on Oct. 15.  Work on a hydrocracker at the 416,000 barrel-a-day
refinery, which had been halted for planned repairs in mid-
September, was originally expected to take six weeks.  Preem AB started maintenance at its Lysekil refinery in
Sweden on Nov. 10, according to a company statement. The work,
which includes catalyst replacement and regulatory inspections
on an isocracker and hydrogen plant, is scheduled to last four
to five weeks, it said. Maintenance was scheduled to begin on
Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
