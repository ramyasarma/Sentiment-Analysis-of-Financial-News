Investors took almost $2.27 billion
out of municipal-bond mutual funds in the week ended Nov. 24,
according to  Lipper FMI , a research company.  It was the second-straight outflow and followed a week in
which investors withdrew more than $3.1 billion, the most since
January 1992, according to  Tom Roseen , senior analyst at Lipper
in Denver. The most-recent data covers Nov. 18 through Nov. 24.  The latest withdrawals occurred as yields on longer-
maturity tax-exempt securities headed for the biggest weekly
drop since August, according to Bloomberg Valuation indexes.
Yields on tax-exempt 30-year bonds fell almost  22 basis points 
to 4.32 percent on Nov. 24 from Nov. 18, the index shows. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Issuers who were rushing to sell taxable Build America
Bonds, known as BABs, before the program is set to end next
month spurred municipal supply to a record this month. Thirty-
year tax-exempts sold off from Oct. 25 through Nov. 18, gaining
about 77 basis points in yield, according to the Bloomberg
Valuation index. Bond yields rise as prices fall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
