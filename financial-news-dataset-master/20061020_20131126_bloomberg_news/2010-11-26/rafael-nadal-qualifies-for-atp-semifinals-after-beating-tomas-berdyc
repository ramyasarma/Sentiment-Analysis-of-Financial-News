Top-ranked Rafael Nadal defeated
Tomas Berdych in straight sets to qualify for the semifinals of
tennis’s ATP World Tour Finals in London.  Nadal beat the sixth-seeded Berdych 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 at the
O2 Arena in his final match in Group A. It was a rematch of the
Wimbledon final in July, which Nadal won in straight sets.  The tournament features a round-robin format with the
season’s eight best players divided into two groups. The top two
in each group advance to the semifinals.  Roger Federer and Andy Murray qualified for the final four
yesterday from Group B. The last semifinal spot will be
determined by tonight’s match between Novak Djokovic and Andy
Roddick.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
