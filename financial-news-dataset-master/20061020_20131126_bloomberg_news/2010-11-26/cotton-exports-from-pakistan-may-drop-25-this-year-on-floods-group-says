Cotton exports from Pakistan,
world’s fourth-biggest producer, may fall 25 percent this fiscal
year because of flooding, according to the Karachi Cotton
Brokers’ Association.  The country’s exports declined 22 percent in the first four
months of the year that began July 1, compared with the same
period a year earlier, as floods destroyed crops, the
association said.  Pakistan’s deadliest floods this year ruined crops worth
281.6 billion rupees ($3.27 billion), destroying rice, cotton
and sugar, Farm Minister  Nazar Muhammad Gondal  said Sept. 28.
Floodwaters ripped out plants, damaged stockpiles and wrecked
4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) of roads, boosting food prices
and potentially accelerating annual inflation to 20 percent,
according to government estimates.  “The impact of the floods is quite clear by now,” Naseem
Usman, chairman of the association, said in a telephone
interview today. “By the end of the year the gap will widen,”
he said, referring to the drop in exports.  Cotton futures traded in Chicago rallied to a record
$1.5195 a pound on Nov. 11 after the U.S. government cut its
estimate for global production and cited a supply shortage in
China. Prices have slumped about 25 percent since then, and the
contract for March delivery traded at $1.1335 at 1:32 p.m.
Singapore time.  Pakistan’s cotton output may plunge 20 percent to about
10.2 million bales this year, from 12.7 million last year,
Chaudhry Masood Majeed, chairman of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners’
Association, said in a telephone interview today from
Bahawalpur.  Pakistan exported 350,020 bales in first four months of the
fiscal year that began July 1, compared with 450,000 bales a
year ago, according to data provided by Karachi Cotton Brokers’
Association. The association estimates total exports this year
may reach 600,000 bales, compared with 800,000 bales last year.  Pakistan’s government has set a production target of 11
million bales in the year ending June 2011, Farm Minister Gondal
said on Nov. 1. A bale in Pakistan weighs 170 kilograms (375
pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
