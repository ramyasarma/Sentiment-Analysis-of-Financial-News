Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. , India’s
largest maker of sport-utility vehicles, said it agreed to buy a
5.5 percent stake in unit  Tech Mahindra Ltd.  from BT Group Plc.  Mahindra will buy the stake “over time” from the U.K.’s
largest fixed-line phone company, according to a statement to
the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The shares will be purchased at
a market-related price in accordance with Indian rules, the
Mumbai-based company said.  BT Chief Executive Officer  Ian Livingston  said in May the
company was reviewing options for its 30 percent stake in the
Indian software-services provider. The London-based company
pared its holding in the venture following a share sale in 2006.  Tech Mahindra  fell 2.5 percent to 608.05 rupees as of 10:54
a.m. in  Mumbai  trading. The stock has slumped 39 percent this
year, while the benchmark Sensex index has climbed 9.1 percent.
Mahindra shares declined 2.3 percent to 763 rupees.  Mahindra has a 43 percent stake in Tech Mahindra, according
to Bloomberg data. The Pune, India-based company last year
 acquired control  of Satyam Computer Services Ltd., the software
developer embroiled in India’s biggest corporate fraud probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
