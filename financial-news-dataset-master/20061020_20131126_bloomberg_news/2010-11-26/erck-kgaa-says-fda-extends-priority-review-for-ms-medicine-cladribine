U.S. regulators extended the review
period for  Merck KGaA’s  cladribine multiple sclerosis pill by
three months, a setback for the drugmaker in the race with Swiss
rival Novartis AG.  The Food and Drug Administration extended the pill’s
priority review period by three months to Feb. 28, 2011, to
examine additional information on the product, Darmstadt,
Germany-based Merck said in an e-mailed statement today.  The FDA’s decision puts Merck further behind Novartis in
the race to provide MS patients with a pill in the U.S., where
the Swiss drugmaker’s Gilenya tablet won approval on Sept. 22.
European regulators rejected cladribine in September, saying the
drug’s benefits didn’t outweigh its risks. Merck shares rose in
Frankfurt trading.  “Some people who had expected the FDA to flat-out reject
the drug see the delay as a sign it isn’t dead yet,”  Hanns Frohnmeyer , an analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in
Stuttgart, said in a telephone interview. He recommends buying
the stock.  Merck climbed 1 cent to 61.04 euros at the close of
Frankfurt trading.  The FDA originally granted cladribine a priority review in
July of this year, shortening the standard 10-month review
period to six months.  U.S. regulators didn’t request more clinical trials, said
 Gangolf Schrimpf , a spokesman for Merck. He declined to
elaborate on what additional information the FDA is reviewing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
