Five people are being charged with
the murder of four illegal miners at Aurora Empowerment Systems
Ltd.’s Grootvlei mine, South African Press Association
reported, citing a spokesman for the National Prosecuting
Authority.  Three security guards and two mine employees are being
charged with four counts of murder and six of attempted murder
at the mine owned by a company run by a nephew of President
Jacob Zuma and a grandson of Nelson Mandela, the Johannesburg-
based news service quoted NPA spokesman Mthunzi Mhaga as saying.  Aurora’s chairman is Zuma’s nephew  Khulubuse Zuma  while
 Zondwa Mandela , the grandson of South Africa’s first black
president, is the chief executive officer. Mandela didn’t
immediately return a message left on his mobile phone seeking
