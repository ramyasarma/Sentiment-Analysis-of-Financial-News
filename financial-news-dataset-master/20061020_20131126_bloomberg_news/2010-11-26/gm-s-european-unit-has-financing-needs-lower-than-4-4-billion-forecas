General Motors Co.’s European
division will need less than the 3.3 billion euros originally
planned to finance its reorganization because of better cash
management and lower interest payments, spokesman Stefan
Weinmann said in a telephone interview. The unit is open to
cooperation with other carmakers, he added, declining to be more
specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
