Copper is in a “corrective move”
which may worsen should prices close below $3.60 a pound,
according to technical analysis by MF Global Holdings Ltd.  The attached chart shows the New York-traded futures fell
to an intraday low of $3.6110 a pound on Nov. 17, a level below
a trend channel that has spanned from the middle of this year,
said Anantharajan Paulpandian, a technical analyst at the
brokerage in Singapore.  “If $3.60 broke, it’s a sell signal” that may trigger
deeper declines, Anantharajan said in a phone interview 
yesterday. Support is located at $3.5250 and around $3.39, 
“where the commodity may fight back,” he said. “Copper is
in a corrective move,” and if prices don’t stabilize above 
$3.3895, the correction may go far deeper, he said.  The most active Comex contract rallied to a 30-month high
of $4.0875 a pound on Nov. 11 on expectations of increased
demand from China, the biggest consumer, where manufacturing
expanded. The metal traded at $3.7540 a pound today.  A trend reversal in the Dollar Index, which headed for a
third weekly gain, is likely to contribute to further weakness
in copper, Anantharajan said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A trend channel is two parallel
lines, one connecting the metal’s highs and the other passing
through the lows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
