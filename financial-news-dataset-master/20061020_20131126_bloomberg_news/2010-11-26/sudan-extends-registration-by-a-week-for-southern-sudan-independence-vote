Sudan gave voters from  Southern
Sudan  an extra week to register for a Jan. 9 referendum on
independence for the oil-producing region, a spokesman for
the commission organizing the vote said.  Registration, which began Nov. 15, will close on Dec.
8, the spokesman, George Maker, said by phone from
Khartoum, the capital.  The referendum is a key component of a 2005  peace
accord  that ended a two-decade civil war between Sudan’s
Muslim north and the south, where Christianity and
traditional beliefs dominate.  Delays in the preparations for the referendum have
raised tension between the former battlefield adversaries,
the  Sudan People’s Liberation Movement , which governs the
south, and President  Umar al-Bashir ’s National Congress
Party in Khartoum.  Southern Sudan’s army said on Nov. 24 the central
government’s armed forces attacked its positions in
northern Bahr el-Ghazal state, wounding four soldiers and
two civilians, in a bid to disrupt the referendum. The
authorities in Khartoum denied the claim.  Southern Sudan accounts for as much as 80 percent of
Sudan’s 490,000 barrels of daily oil production. Sudan is
sub-Saharan Africa’s third-largest producer, according to
the  BP Statistical Review of World Energy .  The majority of southern Sudanese favor independence,
the Washington-based National Democratic Institute said in
an Oct. 20 report, based on 63 focus groups surveyed in 48
locations from Feb. 5 to March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
