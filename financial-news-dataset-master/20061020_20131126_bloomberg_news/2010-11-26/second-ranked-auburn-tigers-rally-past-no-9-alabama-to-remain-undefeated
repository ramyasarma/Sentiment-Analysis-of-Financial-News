The second-ranked Auburn Tigers
rallied from a 21-0 first-quarter deficit to beat No. 9
University of Alabama 28-27, moving within one win of an
undefeated regular season and probable berth in the Bowl
Championship Series national title game.  Down by three touchdowns at the end of the first quarter
and 24-7 at the half, the Tigers (12-0) scored 21 second-half
points against the defending national champion Crimson Tide (9-
3). Auburn took a 28-27 lead with 11:55 remaining in the game on
a 7-yard touchdown pass from Cameron Newton to Philip
Lutzenkirchen and closed the game with a pair of defensive
stands, the second against Alabama back-up quarterback A.J.
McCarron.  “I’m so proud of these guys,” Auburn senior offensive
lineman Lee Ziemba said following the game. “You can see how
resilient they are. They battled to the end.”  Newton, a contender for the Heisman Trophy -- awarded
annually to the best player in college football -- despite
allegations he violated National Collegiate Athletic Association
recruiting regulations, was 13-for-20 passing for 216 yards and
three touchdowns. Newton also rushed for 39 yards, 79 fewer than
his 118-yard season average, including a 1-yard scoring run.  “He’s the man,” Auburn coach  Gene Chizik  said of the
junior quarterback. “I will go to bat for him 100 times out of
100.”  The game was the 75th edition of the Iron Bowl, played each
year between the Southeastern Conference rivals located 160
miles (257 kilometers) apart in Alabama. The Tigers play No. 18
South Carolina (8-3) in the SEC championship game on Dec. 4 in
Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
