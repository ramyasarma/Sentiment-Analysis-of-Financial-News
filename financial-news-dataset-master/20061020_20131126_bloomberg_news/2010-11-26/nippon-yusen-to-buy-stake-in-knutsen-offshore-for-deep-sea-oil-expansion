-- Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s
largest shipping line by sales, will buy a 50 percent stake in
Knutsen Offshore Tankers ASA as it expands into the
transportation of deep-sea oil.  Nippon Yusen didn’t disclose the transaction amount in an
e-mailed release today announcing the purchase. The Nikkei
newspaper earlier put the value at 20 billion yen ($239
million).     The Tokyo-based shipping line, which sold new shares last
year, is predicting a return to profit this fiscal year
following a rebound in demand for container shipments to the
U.S. and Europe. Knutsen earlier this year withdrew a plan for
an initial public offering due to a lack of demand.  Nippon Yusen predicts a profit of 76 billion yen in the
year ending March 31, compared with a loss of 17 billion yen
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
