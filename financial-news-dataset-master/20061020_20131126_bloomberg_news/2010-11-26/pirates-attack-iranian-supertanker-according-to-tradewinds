An Iranian supertanker was attacked
by pirates 850 to 900 miles east of the Horn of Africa,
 TradeWinds  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The Hadi came under “rocket-propelled grenade fire” and
took evasive action, the shipping-industry newspaper said on its
website yesterday. There were no reports of damage to the vessel
or injuries to its crew, according to TradeWinds.  The ship is owned by NITC Co., previously called National
Iranian Tanker Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
