Repsol YPF SA’s Argentine unit, YPF
SA, is pricing shares of the South American unit at $39.93 each,
and hopes to earn as much as $2.4 billion. The shares were
priced in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing
today. Repsol, Spain’s biggest oil company, said yesterday it
filed a U.S. regulatory filing to be able to sell as much as 15
percent of YPF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
