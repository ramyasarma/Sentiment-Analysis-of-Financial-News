The German and French governments
may announce an agreement on a permanent mechanism for tackling
eurozone debt crises in the next few days, the Financial Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The two governments have agreed that the way to involve
private investors in any future debt reorganization is to
include collective-action clauses in bond sales, to make it
easier to get creditors’ agreement to alterations in bond
maturities or values, the newspaper said.  That means any reorganization could be negotiated on a
case-by-case basis between debtor countries and groups of
creditors, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
