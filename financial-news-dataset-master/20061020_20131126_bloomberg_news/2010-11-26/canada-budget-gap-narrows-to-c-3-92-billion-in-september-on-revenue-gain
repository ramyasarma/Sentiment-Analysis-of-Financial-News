Canada’s budget deficit narrowed in
September from a year earlier as revenue increased more than
four times faster than expenditures.  Canada’s deficit was C$3.92 billion ($3.84 billion) in
September, down from C$4.97 billion during the same month last
year, according to the finance department’s monthly fiscal
monitor report from Ottawa. For the fiscal year that began in
April through September, the deficit narrowed to C$17.4 billion
from C$28.6 billion.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  is seeking to eliminate last
year’s record C$55.6 billion deficit by 2015, and become the
first Group of Seven country to balance its books after a global
recession. The next budget will restrain spending and press
ahead with corporate tax cuts to boost job creation, he said in
a Nov. 22 speech.  Revenue increased 13.1 percent in September from a year
earlier to C$17.3 billion, the finance department said. Program
spending rose 3.1 percent to C$18.6 billion.  For the April-to-September period, revenue gained 7.6
percent to C$110.1 billion, while program spending fell 3.2
percent to C$112.2 billion.  About C$9 billion of the deficit in the first half of this
year is linked to a stimulus package aimed to boost the
country’s growth, the report said.  The federal debt increased to C$536 billion on Sept. 30
from C$519.1 billion on March 31, the report said.  The government’s financial requirement, the gap between
cash coming in and going out as opposed to how it’s budgeted
under accounting rules, was C$3.58 billion in September and
C$38.9 billion in the first six months of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
