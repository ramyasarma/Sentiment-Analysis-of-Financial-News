Treasuries headed for a third weekly
loss on speculation Federal Reserve efforts to spur growth and a
recovery in consumer spending will lead to quicker inflation.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices over the life of the securities, widened to as
much as 2.19 percentage points today. The figure was 2.21
percentage points on Nov. 2, the most since May. The five-year
average is 2.09 percentage points.  “The economic figures aren’t so bad,” said  Kei Katayama ,
who helps oversee the equivalent of $54.3 billion as leader of
the foreign fixed-income group in Tokyo at Daiwa SB Investments
Ltd., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest brokerage. The Fed’s plan
to increase the growth rate “only increases the risk of
inflation,” he said.  The benchmark 10-year note  yielded  2.92 percent as of 6:25
a.m. in London, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625
percent security due in November 2020 traded at a price of 97
1/2. The yield increased 38 basis points three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
