The rand weakened, snapping two days
of gains, on concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening and as
North Korea said its skirmish with South Korea may lead to war,
curbing demand for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy depreciated as
much as 0.8 percent to 7.1095 per dollar before trading 0.7
percent down at 7.1016 by 9:19 a.m. in Johannesburg from a close
of 7.0512 yesterday.  The euro fell to a two-month low to the dollar as the
Financial Times Deutschland reported that euro-area policy
makers are pushing Portugal to seek assistance from a 750
billion-euro ($1 trillion) bailout fund. Asian stocks fell as
North Korea warned any “escalated confrontation” will lead to
war, according to state news agency KCNA.  “We are still clearly dealing with the Portugal, Ireland,
Italy, Greece and Spain hangover -- the profligate spending from
the government and lending from the banks in the good times,”
 John Cairns , a Johannesburg-based currency strategist, and
analyst Nema Ramkhelawan wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.
“With markets waking up to the hangover from the Thanksgiving
day holiday in the U.S., we are likely to have a quiet trade day
with no data or major events.”  Bonds declined for a fourth day, with the benchmark 13.5
percent security due September 2015 falling 40 cents or 124.579
rand. A close at this level would be the lowest since Aug. 10.
The yield rose 8 basis points to 7.32 percent, heading for the
highest since Oct. 5.  Forward-rate agreements, or FRAs, showed money-market
investors reduced bets the South African Reserve Bank will
maintain its 6 percent key interest rate when it announces its
next decision on Jan. 20. The cost of  three-month contracts
for cash due in one month  added 5.5 basis points to 5.57
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
