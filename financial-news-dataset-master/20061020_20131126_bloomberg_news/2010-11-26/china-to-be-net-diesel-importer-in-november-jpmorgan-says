China may become a net importer of
diesel in November as new supplies are brought into the country
to meet rising domestic demand,  JPMorgan Chase & Co . said.  Diesel fuel imports will rise “significantly” as the
country tries to refill declining stockpiles and alleviate
shortages at service stations, according to a report by Brynjar
Eirik Bustnes yesterday. The jump in new outside supplies may be
“short-lived” as refiners return from maintenance.  “Due to increased diesel demand, there is now a chance
that November will show China as a net importer of diesel,”
Bustnes said.  China’s diesel imports fell 60 percent in October to 42,674
metric tons, the lowest since November 2008, while exports
climbed 0.9 percent to 359,414 tons, according to data from the
General Administration of Customs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
