REpower Systems AG , a German wind
turbine-maker, aims to double revenue from offshore wind
projects to 30 percent by 2015 after winning what it called a
“breakthrough” order to supply a Belgian offshore project.  The Hamburg-based unit of  Suzlon Energy Ltd. , India’s
biggest wind-turbine manufacturer, secured an order this week to
supply 48 turbines with a capacity of 6 megawatts each to the
Thornton Bank wind farm off Belgium’s coast.  Banks agreed to lend $1.16 billion to the 1.29 billion-euro
($1.7 billion) project. It’s the biggest-ever project financing
in offshore wind, C-Power NV, a Belgian wind farm developer, and
Suzlon said. “With this breakthrough, others will look at”
replicating that deal’s financial structure for more offshore
wind farms in Europe, REpower CEO  Andreas Nauen  said today by
telephone.  “We expect 15 percent of this year’s revenue to come from
offshore,” he said. “The target is to at least double that”
by 2015. Markets with the most potential include Germany, the
U.K., Belgium and the U.S., he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
