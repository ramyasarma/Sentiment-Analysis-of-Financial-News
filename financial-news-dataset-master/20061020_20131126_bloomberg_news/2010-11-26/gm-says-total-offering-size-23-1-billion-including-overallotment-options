General Motors Co.  said the total
value of common and preferred stock sold in its initial public
offering reached $23.1 billion after underwriters exercised an
option to purchase more shares.  The banks bought an additional 71.7 million common shares
at $33 each for $2.37 billion and 13 million more preferred
shares for $650 million, GM said in a statement yesterday. The
amount of common and preferred shares sold was more than the
$22.1 billion raised by Beijing-based  Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd.  this year in the biggest IPO of common stock in history.  The underwriter’s purchase increases the amount of stock
sold by the U.S. Treasury in the IPO to $13.6 billion, bringing
Chief Executive Officer  Dan Akerson  closer to his goal of
returning the $49.5 billion the automaker received in a taxpayer
bailout. Detroit-based GM’s shares have climbed  2.4 percent 
since the company originally raised $20.1 billion on Nov. 17.  “There is a lot of demand right now for the automakers,”
said  Wayne Wilbanks , chief investment officer at Wilbanks, Smith
& Thomas in Norfolk, Virginia, which manages about $1.6 billion.
“The stock has held up very well,” since GM began trading, he
said.  Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp.
and Citigroup Inc. led the GM IPO, an offering that included 35
underwriters, according to filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  GM’s Shares  The automaker’s shares rose 32 cents, or 1 percent, to
$33.80 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .  GM’s owners, including the U.S. Treasury, the United Auto
Workers’ retiree health-care trust, Canada and Ontario sold 478
million shares of common stock on Nov. 17 for $33 each.  The overallotment option brings the total amount of common
shares sold to $18.1 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history
behind San Francisco-based  Visa Inc.’s  $19.7 billion IPO in
March 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Agricultural Bank
of China’s initial offering raised a combined $22.1 billion in
 Shanghai  and Hong Kong last quarter.  The overallotment option lowered the Treasury’s stake in GM
to 33 percent from 37 percent, according to SEC filings. The
government held a 61 percent stake before the IPO.  The UAW trust’s holdings dropped to 13 percent with the
option from 14 percent, filings show. It had a 20 percent stake
in GM before the IPO.  Lehman’s Collapse  General Motors Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on June 1, 2009, after the failure of New York-based
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008 froze credit
markets and helped cause the longest recession since the Great
Depression.  The Treasury needed to sell all of the  GM  shares it held at
an average price of $43.67 to break even on its investment. That
would require its remaining 500 million shares to be sold at
$53.07 each, 57 percent higher than yesterday’s closing price.  GM reported third-quarter net income of $2.16 billion this
month, bringing its  earnings  this year to $4.77 billion. While
the company will have positive earnings before interest and
taxes in the fourth quarter, they will be “significantly
lower” than the first three quarters of the year, Akerson said
on a Nov. 10 conference call.  The automaker sold shares after the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  rose to a two-year high this month on speculation the U.S.
economy won’t slip back into a recession. The benchmark gauge
for U.S. equities slipped for the third time in four days
yesterday amid mounting concern about Europe’s debt crisis and
increasing tensions in Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
