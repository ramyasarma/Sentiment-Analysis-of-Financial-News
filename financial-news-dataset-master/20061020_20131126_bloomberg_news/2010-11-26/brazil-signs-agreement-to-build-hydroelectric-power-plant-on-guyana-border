Brazilian President Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva said Eletricas do Norte do Brasil SA plans to
build a hydroelectric power plant on the border with Guyana.  The two South American countries signed a memorandum of
understanding to determine where the plant will be located, Lula
said during a speech in Georgetown, Guyana.  Lula also announced an optical fiber network has reached
the Brazilian border with its Northern neighbor to integrate the
two countries with broadband communication and government
support for Brazilian companies to build a road connecting the
nations.  Latin America’s largest economy will also grant tax breaks
to ‘a list of products’ from Guyana, Lula said, without
elaborating.  Lula said he expects Guyana to act as a “bridge” between
South America and the Caribbean, helping in the negotiations
between the Mercosur and the Caricom regions.   Lula made his remarks at the summit of presidents and
foreign affairs where Guyana President Bharrat Jagdeo awarded
his Brazilian counterpart the Order of Excellence, the highest
distinction in Guyana for a head of state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
