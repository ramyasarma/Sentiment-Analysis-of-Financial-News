Kenya’s shilling slumped the most in
three weeks as lawmakers failed to approve nominees who will
help enact a new charter and on concern that Europe’s debt
problem may spread, curbing demand for higher-yielding assets.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 1.4 percent to 81.58 per dollar, the biggest drop since
Nov. 8, before trading 0.3 percent weaker at 80.65 by 4:38 p.m.
in Nairobi from a previous close of 80.45.  Kenyan lawmakers didn’t approve President  Mwai Kibaki ’s
nominees to sit on two commissions tasked with enacting a new
constitution, the Daily Nation reported, citing parliamentary
proceedings. The committees were supposed to be in place within
90 days of the charter being signed into force on Aug. 27, it
said. Emerging-market stocks and currencies dropped and the euro
weakened for the fourth time in five days on concern Portugal or
Spain may join Ireland in seeking a bailout from the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund.  “Euro weakness and concern about debt in the region has
resulted in an emerging-market currency risk-off day,” Steve
Lagat, a currency trader at CFC Stanbic Financial Services Ltd.,
said in a telephone interview from Nairobi today. “The market
has also been uncertain following news about disagreements
regarding the constitution as it seems like nothing is
forthcoming.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
