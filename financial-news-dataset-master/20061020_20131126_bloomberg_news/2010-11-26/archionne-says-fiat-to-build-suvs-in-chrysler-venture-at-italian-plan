Fiat SpA  plans to build cars and
sports-utility vehicles for the Jeep and Alfa Romeo brands as
part of a joint venture with Chrysler Group LLC at its Mirafiori
plant in Turin, Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said.  The carmaker plans to use U.S. “platforms” and make as
many as 280,000 vehicles a year at the plant, Marchionne said in
a speech to unions today in Turin. New Jeep and Alfa models will
be ready by the fourth quarter of 2012.  Italy’s largest manufacturer is spending 20 billion euros
($26.5 billion) through 2014 to improve factories and vehicle
development in exchange for union concessions on work rules.
Marchionne said today that new labor rules will be needed for
the Mirafiori plant.  Fiat, which acquired a 20 percent stake in Auburn Hills,
Michigan-based Chrysler last year, has said it will raise the
holding to 25 percent by the first quarter of 2011 and to 35
percent by the end of next year. Marchionne plans to take the
U.S. automaker public in the second half of 2011.  “This is the plan we wanted,” Fiat union Fismic general
manager Roberto Di Maulo said in an interview. “There’s no
uncertainty about the future anymore.” He added that his union
wants to complete an agreement with Fiat by Christmas.  The plan “keeps the workforce,” Antonio D’Anolfo, national
secretary of the Ugl union, told Bloomberg. “It may lead to new
hires.”  Fiat fell  as much as 3.8 percent in Milan, and traded at
13.02 euros, down 3.5 percent, at 12:02 p.m. The stock has
gained about 27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
