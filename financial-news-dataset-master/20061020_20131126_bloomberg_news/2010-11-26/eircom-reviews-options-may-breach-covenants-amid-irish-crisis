Eircom Group , Ireland’s largest
phone operator, said it may breach the terms of its loans as the
country’s austerity measures imposed to combat the collapse of
the banking system forces consumers to cut spending.  The company, which has to service 3.15 billion euros ($4.2
billion) of debt used to fund its buyout by Temasek Holdings Pte
Ltd., is assessing its options, Eircom’s Chief Financial Officer
 Peter Cross  said on a conference call today.  “We have positive headroom as of September, so it is
something we have some time to deal with,” said Cross, who
reiterated he’s confident Eircom can avoid default with an
equity injection or by renegotiating the covenants with lenders.  The crisis in Ireland’s economy and banking system has
magnified the effect of increased competition in voice and
mobile services. Declining revenue has combined with “high”
debt levels to push the company close to a covenant breach, the
Dublin-based company said in a statement.  Eircom’s loan covenants may be violated in the next 12
months if no action is taken, the company said.  “You’ve got the decline of the traditional incumbent from
competition, combined with the Irish economic downturn,” said
 Jonathan Moore , an analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd. in
London. “That’s all been mixed up with an inappropriate capital
structure with too much debt for a business like this.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
