Soybeans fell for the first time
this week as China, the world’s largest importer, may limit
lending to curb commodity speculation and boost sales of
government inventories to reduce inflation. Wheat and corn rose.  China’s central bank raised interest rates last month for
the first time since 2007 and ordered banks twice this month to
hold more money in reserve. The government will sell 300,000
metric tons of soybean stockpiles on Dec. 3. China released 25.5
million tons of grains and edible oils since the end of October,
the National Development and Reform Commission said.  “Chinese efforts to curb inflation with higher interest
rates and additional sales of government-owned inventories are
keeping pressure on soybeans,” said  Dax Wedemeyer , a broker at
U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “Increased
sales my slow imports from the U.S.”  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 7.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $12.475 a bushel at 10:16 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. A close at that price would trim this week’s gain to
3.8 percent and leave the commodity up 19 percent this year.  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 6 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $6.9125 a bushel on the CBOT. Corn futures for March
delivery gained 0.75 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $5.545 a bushel.  China pledged to contain consumer costs after inflation
accelerated at the fastest pace since 2008 and food prices
jumped 10.1 percent in October. The government may cut the
target for new lending next year, Shanghai Securities News
reported. The country’s futures exchanges raised margins to
discourage speculators.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
