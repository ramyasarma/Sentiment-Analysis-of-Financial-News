Preem AB, Sweden’s largest refiner,
said third-quarter profit from turning crude into fuels such as
gasoline and diesel fell 13 percent because of sliding demand.  Profit decreased to $2.97 a barrel from $3.43 a year
earlier, the Stockholm-based company said today in a  statement 
on its website.  The margins fell “as a result of limited demand despite
increased supply following periods of planned maintenance
outages and the subsequent ramping up processes,” the company
said in the statement.  Preem began maintenance at its Lysekil  refinery  on Sweden’s
west coast on Nov. 10, according to the statement. The work,
which includes catalyst replacement and regulatory inspections
on an isocracker and hydrogen plant, is scheduled to last four
to five weeks, it said. Isocrackers are involved in diesel
production.  A separate maintenance halt that began on Sept. 2 at the
220,000 barrel-a-day Lysekil facility lasted a month longer than
expected because of additional repairs, according the statement.
Units including a platformer, which makes components for
gasoline, resumed operations as of Nov. 4, it said. The work was
expected to be completed in early October.  Crude use declined by 3.8 million barrels during this time
compared with initial estimates of 2.2 million barrels, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
