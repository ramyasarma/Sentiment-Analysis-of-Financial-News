Commodity assets under management
rose $19 billion to a record $340 billion last month, led by
demand for index-linked investments, Barclays Capital said.  Investment flows into products linked to commodity indexes
reached $7 billion in October, the bank’s analysts said in a
report late yesterday. Total inflows into indexes, medium-term
notes and exchange-traded products were $50.6 billion in the
year to October, London-based  Suki Cooper ,  Roxana Mohammadian Molina ,  Kevin Norrish  and  Amrita Sen  wrote in the report.  The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate
near zero since December 2008 and plans to pump another $600
billion into the economy through June by buying government
bonds, known as quantitative easing. It purchased $1.7 trillion
of securities in a first phase that ended in March.  “QE2 has provided a tonic to commodity markets over the
past few months that even the re-emergence of sovereign-debt
concerns has not entirely canceled out,” the Barclays analysts
said in the report.  The S&P GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw materials,
tracking the net amount investors received, rose 2.6 percent
last month, taking its advance since the end of August to 11
percent. Cotton, corn and sugar had the largest gains and lean
hogs, nickel and heating oil were the worst performers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
