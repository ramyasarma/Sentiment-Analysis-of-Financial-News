The “claim that China will stop
exports of rare earth is completely groundless,” Ma Kai, a
Chinese state councilor, said in a speech today.  “At the same time, we also hope that other countries with
rare earth deposits can also produce rare earth to meet global
demand,” Kai said in Hamburg following a meeting between German
and Chinese business leaders in the German city today.  “The world is not in shortage of rare earth resources --
the problem is in the supply and demand structure,” said Kai.
“China accounts for only 36 percent of rare earth deposits,
however, we contribute more than 90 percent of the world
exports. Many countries also have abundant resources of rare
earths but they don’t explore them or export them and rely on
imports. Can this be sustained? The answer is no,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
