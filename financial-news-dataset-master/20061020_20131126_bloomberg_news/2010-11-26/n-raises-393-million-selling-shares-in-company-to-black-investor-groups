MTN Group Ltd. , Africa’s largest
mobile phone operator, said it raised 2.78 billion rand ($393
million) in a sale of shares to black investors.  The company offered 80.9 million MTN Zakhele shares to
black South Africans at a discounted 20 rand each as demand for
the securities exceeded supply by 1.7 times, Johannesburg-based
MTN said in a stock-exchange statement today. MTN fell 82 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to 124.25 rand at 9:18 a.m. in Johannesburg,
curbing the advance so far this year to  5.4 percent .  South African companies are required by law to have black
shareholders as part of the government program to break white
control of the economy and make up for discrimination under
apartheid, which ended in 1994.  Shanduka Group Ltd., founded by MTN Chairman  Cyril Ramaphosa , was allocated 187.3 million rand worth of shares,
equivalent to about 9.4 million shares, the statement said.  Phuthuma Nhleko , MTN’s chief executive officer who sold
shares worth 424 million rand on Nov. 17, was allocated about 2
million shares at a price of 40.2 million rand, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
