Japanese  stocks  fell, sending the
Topix index to its first weekly decline in four weeks, led by
brokerages on speculation recent gains will not be sustained.  Nomura Holdings Inc. , the nation’s biggest brokerage,
dropped 2 percent. Daiwa Securities Group Inc., the No. 2,
slumped 2.3 percent. Ryohin Keikaku Co., the operator of the
Muji retail chain, slid 1.5 percent after the Nikkei newspaper
said the company may post a profit decline. Tension between
North Korea and South Korea also weighed on the market.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 0.4 percent to 10,039.56
at the close in Tokyo after gaining as much as 0.5 percent. The
broader  Topix  index fell 0.3 percent to 866.81. For the week,
the Nikkei advanced 0.2 percent, while the Topix retreated 0.3
percent. The Nikkei 225 has increased 9.1 percent this month,
the fastest pace among the world’s top 40 equity indexes.  “Japanese stocks jumped in a short period and narrowed the
gap in performance with other markets,” said Ikuo Mitsui, who
helps manage $270 million at Vivace Capital Management Co.
“Investors want to see how the market will move from now.”  Stocks in the Nikkei are valued at 17.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 14.1 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12 times for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
