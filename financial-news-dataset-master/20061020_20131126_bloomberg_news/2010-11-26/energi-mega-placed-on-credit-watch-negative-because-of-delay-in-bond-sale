PT Energi Mega Persada, Indonesia’s
second-biggest listed oil company, had its B- rating placed on
credit watch negative because of the delay in its planned dollar
bond sale, Standard & Poor’s said in a statement yesterday.  The company hired Nomura Holdings Inc. earlier this month
to help it with the sale and met investors in Europe, Asia and
the U.S., a person familiar with the matter said Nov. 2.  B- is S&P’s sixth-highest speculative grade and the rating
was placed on credit watch “because the company’s proposed
issuance of $275 million senior secured notes is taking longer
than we had expected to close,” the risk assessor said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
