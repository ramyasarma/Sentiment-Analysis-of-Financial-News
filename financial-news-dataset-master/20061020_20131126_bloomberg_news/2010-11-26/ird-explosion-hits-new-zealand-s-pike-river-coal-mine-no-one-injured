A third blast hit the New Zealand
mine where 29 workers died in the past week after two earlier
explosions,  Pike River Coal Ltd. ’s Chairman  John Dow  said.  The explosion, lasting about 20 seconds, happened at 3:39
p.m. local time and no one was injured, Dow told reporters
during a press conference in Greymouth. The blast isn’t likely
to impede recovery work at the coal mine, Chris McGehan, a
spokeswoman for Greymouth police, said by phone.  The first blast at Wellington-based Pike River’s mine on
the West Coast of the South Island occurred on Nov. 19, followed
by a larger explosion on Nov. 24 that prompted police to say no
one would have survived. Rescue teams were unable to enter the
mine because of toxic gases and potential explosions. The
incident is the country’s worst mining disaster in 96 years.  “The environment continues to remain unstable,” Dow said
in an interview broadcast on Sky News. The blast was captured on
closed circuit television, he said.  Pike River’s board held a meeting today to consider
options for the mine. It would be “days” before anyone
reentered the mine, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Whittall  said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
