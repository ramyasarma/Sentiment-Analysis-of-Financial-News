Coach Inc., the largest U.S. maker
of luxury leather handbags, is likely to be a top-performing
retailer this holiday season, according to  Laura Champine , an
analyst at Cowen & Co.  “I would be buying Coach for the holidays,” Champine said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television on “Surveillance
Midday” with  Tom Keene . “I think they’re going to do great
with their new product line. We would stay away from Williams-
Sonoma.”  San-Francisco-based Williams-Sonoma Inc. is a gourmet-
cookware retailer. Williams-Sonoma shares  fell  43 cents to
$33.47 after reaching a 52-week high of $36.82 on Nov. 5.  Shoppers across the U.S. during today’s Black Friday, the
biggest shopping day of the year, started early to take
advantage of deals as they face down a slower economic recovery
than projected. Retailers view Black Friday -- so named because
that’s when many stores become profitable -- as a bellwether for
the entire holiday season.  New York-based Coach’s shares  fell  73 cents to $55.90 per
share, after touching $56.94 yesterday, a 52-week high. Coach’s
one-year total return is 58.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
