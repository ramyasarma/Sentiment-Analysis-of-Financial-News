U.S. Treasuries advanced, paring
their monthly and weekly losses.  The gains pushed the 10-year  yield  down by two basis points
to 2.90 percent as of 9:12 a.m. in London. Yields on 30-year
securities declined two basis points to 4.26 percent.  Treasuries declined this month after the Federal Reserve
embarked on a plan to pump $600 billion into the economy to
safeguard growth and boost prices. U.S. government securities
handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent in November, following a
0.2 percent decline in October, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes.  Treasuries haven’t delivered negative returns for two
consecutive months since they declined June of 2009, when signs
of economic improvement were eating into demand for debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
