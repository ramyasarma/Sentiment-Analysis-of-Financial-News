Derek Jeter  started contract
negotiations with the New York Yankees by asking for a six-
year, $150 million deal, the  Daily News  reported.  Jeter, who has won five World Series titles in 16
years with the Yankees, is standing firm on $25 million per
year, according to the New York newspaper, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the negotiations. The
Yankees originally offered the 11-time All-Star a three-
year, $45 million deal that would make Jeter, 36, the
highest-paid shortstop in Major League Baseball.  Jeter’s agent,  Casey Close , disputed the Daily News
report in an e-mail to the Star-Ledger, writing that “the
recently rumored terms of our contract proposal are simply
inaccurate” and refusing further comment to the Newark,
New Jersey, newspaper.  The Yankees declined this week to offer Jeter salary
arbitration, meaning that negotiations will be conducted
between the player and the team. Yankees General Manager
 Brian Cashman  has said the team would like to keep the
shortstop.  Jeter’s 10-year, $189 million contract expired last
season, when he batted .270 with a .340 on-base percentage,
both the lowest since he became a full-time player in 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
