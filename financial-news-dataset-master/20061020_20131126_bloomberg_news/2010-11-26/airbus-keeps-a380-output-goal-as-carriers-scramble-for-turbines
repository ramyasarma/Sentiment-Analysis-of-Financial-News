Airbus SAS can maintain its delivery
schedule for the A380 superjumbo this year and next, even as
carriers flying the jet scramble to switch some engines after a
blowout this month, Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders  said.  Airbus wants to deliver two aircraft a month on average to
customers in 2011, and the schedule of handing over about 20
A380s this year also stands, Enders said in an interview at a
conference in Berlin today. The executive said Airbus can
probably sell as many as 800 of the world’s largest aircraft
over the program’s lifespan of about half a century.  “Any difficulties at the start of production are a sad
thing, but we expect the A380 to be a plane to be built for 40
or 50 years to come,” Enders said. “I firmly expect we can
sell 700 or 800 of it over time, maybe even more.”  The A380 program has come under pressure after a Rolls-
Royce Group Plc engine powering a Qantas Airways Ltd. double-
decker blew up on Nov. 4. Carriers using the turbines have
switched some power plants, forcing Airbus to dip into its
assembly line for spares and potentially disrupting output.  Enders said deliveries in the first half may need some
adjusting, as Airbus juggles its output plan with carriers’
needs for replacement Trent 900 engines.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG, with the youngest fleet among the
A380 operators, has changed two engines on its A380s, and
Singapore Airlines Ltd, the first carrier to fly the aircraft in
2007, has also switched some engines, as has Qantas.  The A380, which typically seats more than 500 passengers,
has burdened Airbus for years. Deliveries remained behind target
prior to 2010 as faulty designs in the initial production phase
and airlines’ requests for custom interiors slowed production.
Airbus wants to hand over 20 A380s in 2010, double the amount
from 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
