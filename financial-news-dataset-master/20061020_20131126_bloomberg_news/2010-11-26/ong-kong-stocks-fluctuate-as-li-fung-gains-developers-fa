Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  fell,
sending the index to its biggest weekly drop in almost five
months, as banks and developers slid amid speculation that China
will step up policies to curb inflation and as North Korea
warned of war if its clash with the South escalated.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s No.
1 lender by market value, sank 1.8 percent after the Shanghai
Securities News said the government may cut the target for new
lending next year. China Resources Land Ltd., a state-controlled
developer, dropped 1.1 percent. Hong Kong developers also fell
on concern government measures to curb property prices are
slowing the real-estate market.  China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd. ,
a milk producer, tumbled 13 percent on its first day of trading.  “The macro-economic condition isn’t that good with China’s
monetary tightening concerns,” said  Francis Lun , general
manager at Fulbright Securities Ltd. Hong Kong’s “government
measures to cool property prices are showing some effect, and
developers are headed for a long decline.”  The  Hang Seng Index  fell 0.8 percent to 22,877.25 at the
close, with all but five stocks declining on the 45-member gauge.
The index fell 3.1 percent this week, the biggest weekly drop
since the period ended July 2. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies lost 1.4
percent to 12,757.10.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 0.8 percent to 22,860.  To contact the reporter on this story:
