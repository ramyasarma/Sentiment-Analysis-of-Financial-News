Play on day two of the series-
opening Ashes cricket Test in Brisbane was abandoned in the
final session because of bad light and rain.  Australia had reached 220-5 in reply to England’s first-
innings 260 when the umpires called an end to the day’s play
with 17 overs still remaining. Play will start half an hour
early tomorrow to make up for lost time.  Mike Hussey is 81 not out, with Brad Haddin on 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
