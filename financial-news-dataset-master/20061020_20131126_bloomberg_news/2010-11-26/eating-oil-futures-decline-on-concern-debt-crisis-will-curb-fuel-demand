Heating oil declined amid concern
that Europe’s debt crisis will hinder economic growth and curb
fuel demand.  Futures sank as the dollar strengthened and equities
dropped after the cost of insuring against defaults by Portugal,
Spain and Ireland rose to records. The U.S. currency advanced as
much as 1.2 percent to a two-month high against its European
counterpart, reducing the investment appeal of dollar-
denominated commodities. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell
0.8 percent at 1:46 p.m. in New York.  “The dollar is up and everything else is getting pounded
because of the European debt situation,” said  Tom Knight , vice
president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana, Texas.  Heating oil for December delivery slipped 0.93 cent, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.3162 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, which closed floor trading at 1:30 p.m.
local time. The more actively traded January contract sank 0.88
cent to $2.333. There was no floor trading yesterday for the
U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.  The crack spread between oil and the fuel narrowed 27 cents
to $14.23 a gallon.  The Energy Department reported Nov. 24 that stockpiles of
distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, fell 541,000
barrels last week to 158.3 million, the lowest level since June
18. Inventories are 5.2 percent below a year earlier and 15
percent above the five-year average for the period.  The dollar rose 0.9 percent to $1.3234 against the euro at
2:09 p.m. in New York, from $1.336 yesterday.  The dollar has also been supported by escalating tensions
on the Korean Peninsula, said  Gordon Elliott , a risk management
specialist at FC Stone LLC in St. Louis Park, Minnesota.  Korean Tension  North Korea on Nov. 23 shelled a South Korean fishing
community and military base, killing four people. President
 Barack Obama  dispatched the USS George Washington to take part
in military drills scheduled between Nov. 28 and Dec. 1 in the
Yellow Sea off the western coast of the Korean peninsula.  “If there is action over there the U.S. dollar should
stand pretty firm,” reducing the appeal of commodities as a
hedge against inflation, Elliott said.  Gasoline for December delivery dropped 0.33 cent to
$2.2103 a gallon, while the more actively traded January
contract slipped 0.34 cent to $2.1584. The premium of gasoline
over crude oil, or the crack spread, based on January contracts,
narrowed 5 cents to $6.89 a barrel.  There’s some “backtracking” from the rally before the
Thanksgiving holiday that hinged on a drop in jobless claims,
Knight said. The gain happened while fundamentals for the fuel
were poor, he said. Gasoline prices rose 3.7 percent Nov. 24.  Gasoline Inventories  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose 1.91 million barrels to 209.6
million last week, the first increase in five weeks. Supplies
are 4 percent above the five-year average for the period.  D emand  for the fuel fell 1.4 percent to a six-week low of
8.83 million barrels a day.  Consumption , averaged over four
weeks, was up down 0.3 percent from a year earlier.  Regular gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.2
cent to $2.863 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
