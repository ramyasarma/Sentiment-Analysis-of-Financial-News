U.K. new housing registrations, a
gauge of future  construction , rose 11 percent in October, the
National House-Building Council said.  The number of registrations to build homes climbed to
10,028 from 9,033 in September, NHBC, a U.K. insurer of new
homes, said in an e-mailed statement today. The level of
registrations has been between 9,000 and 11,000 a month since
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
