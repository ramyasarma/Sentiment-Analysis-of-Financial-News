Millions of Londoners face renewed
travel disruption this weekend with the fourth 24-hour strike on
London Underground since September planned for Nov. 28 and 29,
Transport for London said in an e-mailed statement.  Unions representing around 10,000 London subway workers
called the strike in protest against 800 planned job cuts among
ticket office workers and station managers and reduced opening
hours for ticket offices.  If the strike goes ahead, A range of alternative services
will be provided, including more than 100 extra buses, capacity
for 10,000 additional river journeys, and taxis and municipal
bicycles for hire, Transport for London said in the statement.  The stoppage is due to begin at 6:30 p.m. on Nov. 28 and
service is to return to normal on the morning of Nov. 30,
Transport for London said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
