Lawmakers urged Prime Minister  David Cameron  not to lock Britain into “unbreakable” defense
contracts after a deal with  BAE Systems Plc  prevented the
cancellation of an order for a second aircraft carrier.  The contract, agreed by the previous Labour government, was
symptomatic of the difficulties in controlling the 37 billion-
pound ($58 billion)  defense budget , Parliament’s cross-party
Treasury Committee said in a report today on the government
spending cuts.  Cameron was forced to go ahead with both carriers at a cost
of more than 5 billion pounds after BAE Chief Executive Officer
 Ian King  wrote to him in early October warning that cancelling
the HMS Prince of Wales may cost more than building it. The
government plans to mothball or sell one of the ships by 2020.  “Successive governments have struggled to deal with an
overcommitted defense budget,” Treasury Committee Chairman
 Andrew Tyrie , a Conservative Party lawmaker, said in a
statement. “The Treasury should draw on the lessons from the
seemingly unbreakable carrier contract to analyze all future
Ministry of Defense procurement to ensure that value for money
is being obtained.”  Under the terms of deal with BAE, the government would have
saved little in direct costs by cancelling the second carrier
and incurred rationalization expenses potentially running to
hundreds of millions of pounds, King warned in  the letter .  Dropping the order would also have led to thousands of job
losses at BAE and its suppliers and spelled the end of complex
shipbuilding in Britain, he warned.  The defense ministry will see its budget cut by 7.3 percent
in real-terms over the next four years, the smallest reduction
of any major department whose spending is not ring-fenced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
