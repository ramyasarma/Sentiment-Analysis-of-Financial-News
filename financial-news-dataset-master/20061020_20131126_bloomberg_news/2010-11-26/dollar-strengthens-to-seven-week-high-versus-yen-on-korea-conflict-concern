The dollar rose to a seven-week high
against the yen as concern the conflict between North and South
Korea will worsen boosted demand for the safety of the U.S.
currency.  The U.S. currency climbed to 83.86 yen as of 11:12 a.m. in
Tokyo from 83.60 yesterday in New York, after rising to 83.89,
the strongest since Oct. 5.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
