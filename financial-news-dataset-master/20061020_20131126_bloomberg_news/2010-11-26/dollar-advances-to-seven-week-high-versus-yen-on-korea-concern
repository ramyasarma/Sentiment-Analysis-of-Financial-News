The dollar rose to a seven-week high
against the yen as concern the conflict between North and South
Korea will worsen increased demand for the relative safety of
the U.S. currency.  The greenback rose versus 15 of its 16 major counterparts
as the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier for military exercises off
the Korean peninsula in a show of strength after the North this
week shelled a South Korean island. The euro fell toward a two-
month low against the dollar on speculation Ireland’s debt
crisis will spread to Portugal and Spain amid signs the region’s
economic recovery is slowing.  “There seem to be ongoing tensions between the Koreas, and
Japan is geographically close to them,” said  Masanobu Ishikawa ,
general manager of foreign exchange at Tokyo Forex & Ueda Harlow
Ltd. “This may be causing some buying of the dollar and selling
of the yen.”  The dollar advanced to 83.83 yen as of 12:04 p.m. in Tokyo
from 83.60 yen in New York yesterday, after earlier rising to
83.89 yen, the highest level since Oct. 5. The euro declined to
$1.3325 from $1.3360, after dropping to $1.3285 on Nov. 24, the
weakest since Sept. 22. The single currency traded at 111.70 yen
from 111.69 yen.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  has dispatched the USS George
Washington to take part in the military drills, scheduled for
Nov. 28 to Dec. 1 in the Yellow Sea off the western coast of the
Korean peninsula.  To contact the reporters on this story:
