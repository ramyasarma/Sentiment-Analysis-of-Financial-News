The economic recovery in the euro
region strengthened in November for a second month as consumer
and business executives grew more optimistic about the outlook,
the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The monthly index measuring economic expansion in the 16
nations that share the single currency rose to 0.45 percent from
0.41 percent in October, the London-based  Center for Economic
Policy Research  and the Bank of Italy, which co-produce the
index, said in an faxed  statement  today.  “The rise was due principally to improvement in business
and consumer confidence,” according to the statement. This
month’s level “indicates an annualized growth rate of just
under 2 percent.”  The index, which includes price figures and stock-market
performances, industrial production, business and consumer
confidence readings, aims to provide a real-time estimate of
economic growth, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
