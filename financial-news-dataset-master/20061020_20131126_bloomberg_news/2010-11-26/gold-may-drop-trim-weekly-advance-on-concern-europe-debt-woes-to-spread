Gold declined the most in a week as
demand in China may slow and the dollar’s rally reduced the
appeal of the metal as an alternative investment. Silver fell 3
percent.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange will increase margins on
gold, copper and aluminum after the market closes on Nov. 29 as
China moves to curb speculation and damp inflation. The dollar
rose to a two-month high against a six-currency basket on demand
for a haven amid concerns that the North and South Korean
conflict and European debt crisis will escalate.  “China raising margin requirements will reduce excessive
speculation, and put a lot of pressure on the market,” said
 Phil Streible , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
Chicago. Gold is trading as “a currency alternative,” he said.  Gold futures for February delivery fell $10.70, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $1,364.30 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, the biggest drop for a most-active contract
since Nov. 16. U.S. markets were closed yesterday for the
Thanksgiving holiday.  The metal has gained 24 percent this year, reaching a
record $1,424.30 on Nov. 9.  “Bullion prices have been under pressure as a result of
the decline in risk sentiment,”  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in a report. Gold may
“remain underpinned by investment bargain hunting as investors
look to diversify against the volatile macro-economic and
geopolitical background,” he said.  Silver futures for March delivery slid 83.1 cents to
$26.772 an ounce. The price has jumped 59 percent this year,
reaching a 30-year high of $29.34 on Nov. 9.  Platinum futures for January delivery dropped $13.20, or
0.8 percent, to $1,645.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for March delivery declined $18.60, or
2.7 percent, to $678.85 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
