Ecopetrol SA , Colombia’s state-
controlled oil company, will offer 1 trillion pesos ($523
million) of inflation-linked securities as early as Dec. 1 in a
record offering for the local exchange.  Bogota-based Ecopetrol will offer inflation-linked debt due
in five, seven, 10 and 30 years next week, Laura Ramirez, a
member of the sales group at Correval SA, which is helping
manage the sale, said in a phone interview today. Correval and
Valores Bancolombia SA are the lead managers.  Ecopetrol will announce the date of the debt sale later
today, she said.  The one-time offering of 1 trillion pesos debt would make
the sale the biggest corporate bond issue in the Colombian
market, according to Ramirez. Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores SA,
Colombia’s biggest financial holding company, sold a record 750
billion pesos of bonds in December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
