QSR Brands Bhd.  jumped to a 13-year
high in Kuala Lumpur trading after Carlyle Group made a 1.94
billion ringgit ($619 million) takeover offer for the Malaysian
fast-food chain operator.  QSR rose 10.5 percent to close at 6.20 ringgit, its highest
level since September 1997. Carlyle, a Washington, D.C.-based
private equity firm, offered 6.70 ringgit a share for all of QSR,
the fast-food company’s parent  Kulim (Malaysia) Bhd.  said
yesterday in a statement. The offer was 19 percent more than the
previous closing price.  A takeover would give  QSR ’s new owner control of  KFC
Holdings (Malaysia) Bhd. , the nation’s biggest fast-food
operator, as well as the Pizza Hut chain of restaurants in
Malaysia and Singapore. Johor Corp., QSR’s biggest shareholder,
doesn’t support a previous takeover offer made by Idaman Saga
Sdn., state news service Bernama reported yesterday.  “We view Carlyle Group’s proposed takeover positively,”
AmResearch Sdn. said in a report today. “A change in ownership
could be beneficial to KFC, as the group would be unencumbered
with further related-party transactions involving ultimate
parent company, Johor Corp.”  Idaman Saga, part owned by former Renong Bhd. chairman
 Halim Saad , made an indicative bid of 5.60 ringgit a share on
Nov. 22.  Johor’s Stake  Kulim rose 3.3 percent to 12.40 ringgit and KFC Holdings
gained 1.5 percent to 4.01 ringgit.  Johor has a 51.2 percent stake in Kulim, according to
Kulim’s annual report. Kulim owns 57.5 percent of  QSR , according
to yesterday’s statement to the stock exchange.  QSR holds 50.6 percent of  KFC , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A takeover of QSR will trigger an offer for KFC
Malaysia, Kulim said in a separate statement yesterday.  Listed in April 2004, QSR operates more than 530 KFC
restaurants in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Cambodia, and
about 230 Pizza Hut outlets in Malaysia and Singapore, according
to its  website .  Corporate deals have surged this year in Malaysia as the
economy rebounds, with $20.6 billion of local mergers and
acquisitions announced compared with $7.2 billion for all of
2009, Bloomberg data show. Malaysia’s government has forecast
economic growth of as much as 7 percent this year, the fastest
in a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
