Natural gas futures rose to the
highest price in almost four months as forecasts showed colder-
than-normal weather in the U.S., boosting demand for the heating
fuel.  Gas gained as temperatures in the U.S. East will be below
normal from Dec. 1 to Dec. 5, according to the National Weather
Service. The prior outlook showed normal weather across the East
and above-normal temperatures in the Northeast.  “The six-to-10-day forecast is showing some below-normal
temperatures across the country and the market is reacting to
the cold weather,” said  Michael Rose , director of trading at
Angus Jackson Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Natural gas for January delivery advanced 1.1 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $4.399 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange in its first trading day as a front-
month contract, the highest settlement price since Aug. 6. The
December contract expired at $4.267 on Nov. 24.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Boston will have a low of 28 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2
Celsius) on Dec. 4, 4 degrees below average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. New York will
have a low of 33 degrees, 2 degrees below normal.  Forecast models are also showing temperatures to be below
normal across the country from Dec. 6 to Dec. 10, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  Stockpile Decline  Gas inventories dropped 6 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Nov. 19 to 3.837 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department said on Nov. 24. A surplus to the five-year average
rose to 9.5 percent from 9.3 percent the previous week.  “We still don’t see clear-cut government data that support
strong industrial demand,” Rose said.  The number of rigs operating in the U.S. rose this week,
led by an increase in natural-gas rigs, according to data
published by Baker Hughes Inc.  The rig count gained for the fourth time in five weeks,
rising 10 to 1,687, Houston-based Baker Hughes said on Nov. 24.
Gas rigs climbed 17 to 953, the biggest increase in six months.  Oil rigs fell seven to 724, the first decline in five
weeks, from the highest level since December 1987.  The Energy Department will release its monthly EIA-914
report on Nov. 29. Last month’s report showed U.S. total gas
production gained 1.6 percent to 72.38 billion cubic feet a day
in August.  Production Report  Output in lower-48 states rose 1.8 percent to 65.79 billion
cubic feet, the report showed.  The  EIA-914 report  covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
67,072 as of 1:44 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
274,000. Volume was 239,965 on Nov. 24. Open interest was
749,111 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
802,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
