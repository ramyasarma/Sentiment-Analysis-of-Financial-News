Banco Panamericano  SA’s fraud probe
is prompting at least two of Brazil’s larger lenders to review
internal rules on buying credit portfolios, said the president
of the nation´s association of small and medium-sized banks.  “Some banks are studying the rules for credit portfolio
trades and accounting procedures to make sure there aren’t
others engaged in acrobatics like Panamericano,” Renato Martins
Oliva, who heads  Associacao Brasileira de Bancos,  said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo on Nov. 22.  Federal prosecutors opened a fraud investigation into Sao
Paulo-based Panamericano, the nation’s 21st-largest  lender  by
assets, this month after the central bank found accounting
irregularities related to loan sales that resulted in a 2.5
billion real ($1.45 billion) bailout. Panamericano  shares  sank
38 percent since Nov. 4 while the yield on its bonds due in 2020
climbed to 9.5 percent from 6.9 percent, according to Trace
prices.  The bank, founded by media mogul  Silvio Santos  and focused
on providing consumer finance and auto loans to lower-income
clients, will disclose third-quarter earnings by Dec. 15 after
delaying the report following the bailout, Chief Executive
Officer  Celso Antunes  da Costa said today. Shareholders approved
a new 11-member board today and  Maria Fernanda Coelho , the chief
executive officer of Caixa Economica Federal, as its chairwoman.
Panamericano, whose main shareholders are Caixa, the state-
controlled savings bank, and Grupo Silvio Santos, replaced its
board and named a new chief executive officer after the
investigation began.  Shares Fall  Panamericano slipped 0.6 percent to 4.78 reais. MSCI Inc.’s
index of Brazilian bank shares fell 1.4 percent, with all
lenders falling except for state-run  Banco do Brasil SA .
Panamericano’s dollar bonds due in 2020 fell 0.5 cent on the
dollar to 94.75, pushing up the yield to 9.3 percent, according
to Trace.  Oliva said he couldn’t name the banks reviewing their
internal policies.  “We are reviewing constantly the regulations and looking
for ways to improve the regulations,” central bank President
 Henrique Meirelles  said in a Nov. 17 interview in Brasilia.
“There’s nothing new here. The question here is more a question
of internal controls by the part of the shareholders, the major
shareholders.”  With Caixa taking control of Panamericano, “now it’s going
to be a different ball game,” Meirelles said.  Portfolios  Brazil´s banking association known as Febraban said in a
statement that it plans on helping disclose information on the
buying and selling of credit portfolios by lenders.  “Brazilian banks are studying the creation of a unit to
compile information about credit and loan markets,” Febraban
said in an e-mail today. “The objective would be to register
information about credit portfolios negotiated between banks.”  The probe by central bank officials and prosecutors began
after Banco Central do Brasil discovered about 2.1 billion reais
of losses from improper accounting of sales of credit
portfolios, while the bank identified another 400 million reais
owed to it from the credit-card unit of its controlling
shareholder, Grupo Silvio Santos, Meirelles said in the
interview.  Central bank regulators found that the 1.6 billion reais of
net assets booked by Panamericano was actually negative 900
million reais, Supervision Director Alvir Hoffmann said Nov. 10.
The bank was recording as assets loans it had sold to other
institutions and there is evidence that loan portfolios were
sold more than once, Hoffmann said.  Redemptions  Costa said in an interview today that Panamericano received
about 200 million reais more from clients and lenders daily than
redemptions since Nov. 19. The bank was losing as much as 200
million reais a day from redemptions after the bailout was
disclosed on Nov. 10, a bank official who asked not to be named
in accordance with company policy said at the time. Grupo Silvio
Santos borrowed money from the nation’s deposit insurance fund
to rescue Panamericano.  “We´ve seen net inflows, we´ve had money coming in since
last Friday, and that is already a strong signal that the
initial uncertainties are dissipating,” Costa said.  The buying and selling of loan portfolios among banks
hasn’t been affected by the Panamericano investigation, said
 Gabriel Jorge Ferreira , the head of Brazil’s deposit insurance
fund, known as Fundo Garantidor de Credito.  “We haven’t had absolutely any evidence of that,”
Ferreira said in an interview Nov. 23 in Sao Paulo. “Banks are
improving their control systems, which seems reasonable to me.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
