England’s bowlers fought back on day
two of the series-opening Ashes cricket Test in Brisbane, taking
four wickets in the middle session to reduce Australia to 168-5.  Steven Finn took two wickets and  James Anderson  and  Graeme Swann  one each after Australia had gone into the lunch interval
on 96-1 at the Gabba, where it’s unbeaten in 21 matches.  England, which holds the Ashes following last year’s 2-1
triumph, removed home captain  Ricky Ponting ,  Simon Katich ,
 Michael Clarke  and  Marcus North  in the afternoon session.  Mike Hussey  (46) and  Brad Haddin  (9) shared an unbroken 25-run stand
to leave Australia 92 runs behind England’s first-innings 260.  Anderson removed Ponting for 10 in the second ball after
lunch when the batsman edged a leg-side delivery to wicketkeeper
 Matt Prior . Katich brought up his 25th half-century in Tests
with a boundary before getting caught and bowled by Finn as
Australia fell to 100-3.  Hussey counterattacked either side of the afternoon drinks
break with four boundaries off successive overs from England
spinner Swann, the world’s No. 2 ranked Test bowler.  Prior claimed his 100th dismissal in elite Tests when
Clarke top-edged a Finn delivery on 9 to leave Australia at 140-
4. North lasted just 8 balls before edging a Swann delivery to
 Paul Collingwood , who took a low catch at slip.  Anderson got England’s only breakthrough of the morning
when opener  Shane Watson  edged to England skipper  Andrew Strauss .
Australia’s openers had taken the score to 59-0 in the first
hour after resuming at 25 without loss.  Video Replay  Watson’s dismissal for 36 came one delivery after England
had decided to refer a leg-before-wicket decision to a video
replay, which showed the ball bouncing over the stumps. Katich
had earlier survived an lbw appeal by referral when on 27.  Fast bowler  Peter Siddle  took six wickets, including a hat
trick, on his 26th birthday yesterday to give Australia the edge
on day one.  Siddle removed  Alastair Cook , Prior and  Stuart Broad  in
consecutive deliveries in the final session and finished with
Test-best figures of 6-54 after England had won the toss.  While England won the past two Ashes contests staged in the
U.K., its last series victory on Australian soil was in 1986-87.
Australia has only lost two home series since that defeat to
 Mike Gatting ’s England team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
