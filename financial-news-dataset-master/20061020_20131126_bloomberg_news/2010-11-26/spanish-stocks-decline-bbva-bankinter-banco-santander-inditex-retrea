Spain’s  IBEX 35 Index  fell for a
fourth day in five, losing 174.6, or 1.8 percent, to 9,547.2 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Madrid. The measure has lost 7.1 percent
this week, the steepest weekly decline since May.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market. Symbols are in parentheses after company names.  Banco Santander SA  (SAN SM) led declining Spanish banks,
falling 3.7 percent to 7.53 euros, while  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA  (BBVA SM) dropped 2.4 percent to 7.56 euros.
 Bankinter SA  (BKT SM) fell 2.2 percent to 4.14 euros.  Spanish and Portuguese banks dropped as concern mounted
that the two countries may also need to use the European Union’s
bailout fund.  Ebro Foods SA  (EBRO SM) plunged 4 percent to 15.43 euros,
paring two days of gains. The Spanish food processing company
was downgraded to “hold” from “accumulate” at Caja Madrid
Bolsa. The 12-month share price estimate is 16.81 euros.  Inditex SA  (ITX SM), the world’s largest clothing retailer,
slid 2.8 percent to 58.24 euros, the shares’ steepest drop in
almost five months. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research cut its
rating on the stock to “neutral” from “buy,” citing the
effects of austerity measures on consumer spending.  To contact the reporters on this story:
