South African five-year bonds fell
the most in more than two months, raising the yield to the
highest since August, as concern about European sovereign debt
curbed demand for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
slumped the most since September, falling to 123.994 rand by
5:44 p.m. in Johannesburg. That increased the yield by 21 basis
points to 7.448 percent, the highest since Aug. 13. The yield’s
40 basis-point gain in the past five days is the second-biggest
among similar-maturity debt in emerging economies in Europe and
Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The euro weakened for the fourth day in five versus the
dollar and the extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish
bonds instead of similar-maturity benchmark 10-year German bunds
widened to a euro-era record after the Financial Times
Deutschland reported euro-area policy makers are pushing
Portugal to seek assistance from a 750 billion-euro ($1
trillion) bailout fund.  “South Africa is a high-beta market, we tend to overreact
more than other markets,”  Malcolm Charles , portfolio manager of
Investec Ltd.’s Bond Fund, said by phone from Cape Town today.
“We’re a lot more liquid than others and people are taking risk
off on European concerns.”  Yield  Bonds due March 2021 dropped to the lowest since Aug. 11,
sending the yield to the highest since Aug. 10.  The extra yield investors demand to hold South African debt
instead of U.S. Treasuries had climbed 29 basis points as of
Nov. 24 since reaching an 3 1/2-year low of 114 on Nov. 9,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ Index.  Foreign investors have been net sellers of South African
bonds over the past two days, selling 3.83 billion rand ($535
million) of the securities and paring the amount bought this
year to 67.9 billion rand, according to the JSE Ltd., which
manages the country’s bond and stock exchanges.  “We are still clearly dealing with the Portugal, Ireland,
Italy, Greece and Spain hangover -- the profligate spending from
the government and lending from the banks in the good times,”
 John Cairns , a Johannesburg-based currency strategist, and
analyst Nema Ramkhelawan wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  The rand depreciated to the lowest in more than two months,
slumping as much as 1.7 percent to 7.1727 before trading 0.8
percent weaker at 7.1067 per dollar. Versus the euro, it
strengthened 0.2 percent to 9.4121.  ‘Havens’  “A bit of money has moved to safer-haven regions and
assets following Irish debt problems and we expect the rand to
weaken further, probably to as low as 7.20 to the dollar,”
 Jacques Potgieter , a senior trader at Tradition Financial
Services, said by telephone from Johannesburg today.  Forward-rate agreements, or FRAs, showed money-market
investors reduced bets the South African Reserve Bank will
maintain its  5.5 percent  key interest rate when it announces its
next decision on Jan. 20. The cost of  three-month contracts for
cash due in one month  added 3.5 basis points to 5.55 percent. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  fell for the first time
in three days, dropping 0.4 percent to 31,181.38 by the 5 p.m.
close, taking its decline this week to 0.7 percent, a second of
decreases.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Ana Monteiro  in
