Raw sugar rose for a fourth day on
concern that shipments may be delayed from India, the world’s
second-biggest producer after Brazil. Coffee declined, while
cocoa was little changed.  India will make a decision on allowing more sugar exports
after getting a “dependable” estimate of production and
assessing local demand, Junior Food Minister K.V. Thomas said.
Shipments have been regulated after drought damaged crops last
season. Prices in New York more than doubled since touching a
13-month low on May 7 as adverse weather threatened crops in
China, Russia and Brazil.  “People are looking for some clarity out of India,” said
 Bruno Lima , a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group Inc.
in Campinas, Brazil. “The fundamentals remain strong.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.3 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 28.25 cents a pound to settle at 1 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The commodity has advanced 8 percent
this week, the first rise in three weeks.  The exchange closed early today after being shut yesterday
for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Earlier, the most-active contract fell as much as 2.5
percent as a stronger dollar curbed demand for commodities as
alternative investments.  In London, refined sugar futures for March delivery gained
$1.10, or 0.2 percent, to $718.40 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Coffee Drops  Robusta-coffee futures for March delivery slid for a third
day, declining $12, or 0.6 percent, to $1,835 a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Farmers in  Vietnam , the world’s biggest grower of the
robusta beans used in espresso and instant drinks, started
harvesting coffee after rains delayed picking by almost a month,
local traders said yesterday.  On ICE, arabica-coffee futures for March delivery retreated
4.75 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.027 a pound.  Cocoa futures for March delivery were up $1 to $2,794 a
