China may sell more rapeseed oil
from reserves after the auction today failed to reduce prices
significantly, said state-affiliated researcher Cnyouzhi.com.  Two more auctions of 100,000 metric tons each may be
planned in the next two weeks, Cnyouzhi.com said. China only
sold 70,300 tons of rapeseed oil out of 100,400 tons at an
average price of 9,237 yuan ($1,388) a ton today, the National
Grain & Oil Trade Center said on its website.  China has boosted sales of stockpiled cooking oil and grain
after the State Council ordered government agencies to help
regulate the commodities market and rein in two-year-high
 inflation . Costs of food rose 10 percent in October, the biggest
gain among the components of China’s consumer price index.
Cnyouzhi.com is owned by China Grain Reserves Corp., Sinograin,
official manager of the state food reserves.  “The quantity offered today was small, so the sales had
only a little effect on curbing prices,” Cnyouzhi.com said on
its  website . “Trading of the oilseed complex will likely
fluctuate in the near term” without a clear rising or falling
trend, it said.  Minimum bids for today’s sale were set at 9,200 yuan a ton,
600 yuan lower than current market price, Cnyouzhi.com said. In
Hubei province, which offered the biggest quantity of 26,000
tons out of the 11 regions that conducted sales, the auction
sold 69 percent. That was followed by Jiangsu, which sold the
entire 19,500 tons offered, according to the researcher.  Crude rapeseed oil for May delivery on the Zhengzhou
Commodity Exchange declined as much as 2.3 percent to 9,380 yuan
a ton and traded at 9,432 yuan a ton by 2:21 p.m. local time.  -- William Bi . Editors:  Richard Dobson , James Poole  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
