Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s Nigerian
unit is “ramping up” its Bonny Light crude production and
exports after completing repairs on a pipeline ruptured by oil
thieves, Precious Okolobo, spokesman for the company in Nigeria,
said by phone from Lagos today.  The company will lift the force majeure declared on Bonny
crude loadings as soon as “all the deferred loadings are met,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
