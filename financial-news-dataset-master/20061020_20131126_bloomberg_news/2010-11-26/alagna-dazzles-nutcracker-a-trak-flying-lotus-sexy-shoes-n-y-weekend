Dancing Sugar Plums, Marzipan
Shepherdesses, and the fierce Mouse King are emerging from their
annual hibernation as the New York City Ballet presents  George Balanchine ’s fabled “Nutcracker.”  One ravishing moment comes when the children gasp
“OOOhhhh!” as the Christmas tree just keeps on growing.  At the David H. Koch Theater, 20 Lincoln Center Plaza,
though Jan. 2, 2011. Information: +1-212-870-5570;

chocolate cupcake with coconut caramel pecan icing or a sno-cap
-- devil’s food topped with meringue.  200 Columbus Ave. at 69th St. Information: +1-212-724-8101  Saturday Night  It’s  HARD NYC ’s Turkey Soup night at Terminal 5 on Saturday
night. Beatmaster A-Trak headlines with support from Sweden’s
Miike Snow and  Thom Yorke ’s favorite Flying Lotus.  A-Trak’s squalling rhythms coupled with a fleet-footed
Flying Lotus set will work off any second helpings.  At 610 W. 56th St. Information:
 http://www.terminal5nyc.com/event/5472   Sunday  Worry about your brain as you walk through a dark tunnel
crisscrossed with stroboscopic firing neurons at the American
Museum of Natural History.  Based on the latest neurological discoveries about this
three-pound organ, which uses about 20 percent of the oxygen in
our blood and 25 percent of the glucose we digest, the new show
has thought-provoking interactive displays and brain-teaser
games.  Sit in the Brain Lounge and watch MRI images of New York
Knicks shooting guard Landry Fields as he watches himself play.  Try to draw while looking in a mirror and not at your hand,
or build up a brain by putting its parts together as they
evolved.  “Brain: The Inside Story” is at the American Museum of
Natural History, Central Park West at 79th St., through Aug. 15,
2011. Information: +1-212-769-5100;  http://www.amnh.org/ .  Then head over to the  Shake Shack  for burgers, hot dogs and
fries, washed down with Brooklyn Brewery beer or a chocolate
shake. Expect to wait.  366 Columbus Ave. at 77th St. Information: +1-646-747-8770.  Another option is Pizzeria Uno, where you can get thin
crust or deep-dish pies as well as pasta, chicken and steak
entrees.  432 Columbus at 81st St. Information: +1-212-595-4700.  Sunday Afternoon  Cut a figure on the ice at Central Park’s Wollman Rink.  Skating dates back 4,000 years, when the first speedster
strapped bones to his shoes. Big fans included Napoleon and
Queen Victoria.  You can spin, leap and carve figure eights as the city
skyline shimmers around you. Just watch out for the klutzes
trying out triple Lutzes.  Rentals cost $6.25.  Enter at Central Park South and 59th St. Information:
+1-212-439-6900;

retelling of  Hans Christian Andersen ’s “The Red Shoes.”  A girl tricks her blind old guardian into buying her spiffy
footwear that make her feel sexy and desirable.  Next thing you know, she’s playing hooky from church to
smoke and dance with a soldier. We’ve all been there.  A butcher is involved, so beware: the play is for adults
and “brave” kids over 8.  At St. Ann’s Warehouse, 38 Water St., Brooklyn, through
Dec. 12. Information: +1-718-254-8779;  http://stannswarehouse .  ( Zinta Lundborg  is an editor for Muse, the arts and leisure
