Suzlon Energy Ltd. , India’s largest
wind-turbine maker, plans production for Chinese offshore wind
projects within three years to tap a market that may provide
5,000 megawatts of orders a year, Chairman  Tulsi Tanti  said.  “The current target plan is to start in 2013,” Tanti said
in a phone interview. The Ahmedabad-based company is looking for
a Chinese partner to build offshore wind projects, he said.  Suzlon also has preliminary estimates showing India may
have the potential to produce 25,000 megawatts of power from
wind farms at sea, especially in areas off Tamil Nadu and
Gujarat states, Tanti said in a telephone interview. That
offshore market may begin to develop within four years, he said.  India has a coastline stretching more than 7,500 kilometers
(4,660 miles) although research hasn’t shown locations with
sufficient wind for offshore turbines, according to the  World
Energy Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
