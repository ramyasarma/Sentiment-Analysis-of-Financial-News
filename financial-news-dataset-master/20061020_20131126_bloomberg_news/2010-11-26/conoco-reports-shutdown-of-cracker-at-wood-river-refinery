ConocoPhillips  halted a catalytic
cracker at its Wood River  refinery  in Illinois on Nov. 24,
according to a filing.  The No. 2 cracker tripped and emitted more than 500 pounds
(227 kilograms) of sulfur dioxide, according to a  filing  made
with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.  The Wood River refinery is part of a joint venture with
Alberta oil-sands producer  Cenovus Energy Inc . The venture was
established to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude
processed in ConocoPhillips’s Wood River and Borger, Texas,
refineries.  The refinery is located on the east side of the Mississippi
River in Roxana, Illinois, about 15 miles (24 kilometers)
northeast of St. Louis. The plant processes light, low-sulfur
and heavy, high sulfur, crude oil. It has a capacity of 306,000
barrels a day, according to the company  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
