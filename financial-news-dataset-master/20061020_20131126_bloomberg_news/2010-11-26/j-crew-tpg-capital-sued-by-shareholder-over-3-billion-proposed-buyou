J. Crew Group Inc.  and TPG Capital
were sued by a J. Crew shareholder seeking to block the clothing
retailer’s proposed $3 billion buyout, which he said undervalues
the company.  The acquisition of J. Crew by TPG and Leonard Green &
Partners LP for $43.50 a share “materially undervalues” the
company and is unfair to stockholders, Arnold J. Church, a J.
Crew shareholder, said in a complaint filed Nov. 24 in New York
State Supreme Court.  “In short, the proposed acquisition is designed to
unlawfully divest J. Crew’s public stockholders of the future
growth potential of the company by engaging in an unfair process
riddled with self-dealing,” the complaint states.  J. Crew announced the buyout by TPG and Leonard Green on
Nov. 23. The lawsuit seeks class-action, or group, status on
behalf of J. Crew shareholders, according to the complaint.
Besides J. Crew and TPG, the complaint names as defendants
Leonard Green and J. Crew officers and directors, including
Chief Executive Officer  Millard “Mickey” Drexler .  A J. Crew spokesman couldn’t be reached for comment. A
person who answered the phone at the company’s main number said
the office was closed. Spokesmen for TPG and Leonard Green
couldn’t be reached for comment because their offices were
closed.  The case is Arnold J. Church v. J. Crew Group Inc.,
652101-2010, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
