Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said Lithuania’s unbundling plan for gas utility Lietuvos
Dujos AB, in which OAO Gazprom is a majority shareholder, is
“robbery.”  “Our companies and their German partners in Lithuania
legally acquired part of the assets in the pipeline system,”
Putin said at a business forum in Berlin today. “Now, citing
this third energy package, they’re getting thrown out. What’s
that about? What kind of robbery is that?”  Germany’s E.ON AG is the largest shareholder in Lietuvos
Dujos with a 38.9 percent stake, while Gazprom holds 37 percent,
according to Bloomberg data.  The Lithuanian government decided on May 19 to split the
gas sales and transmission ownership of Lietuvos Dujos, spurring
criticism from Gazprom and E.ON. The initiative is part of the
European Union’s drive to force dominant energy companies to
give competitors access to transmission networks, according to
the government.  EU lawmakers in April 2009 approved legislation forcing
members to choose one of three options to ease access to power
and gas grids. The choices are to force the companies to sell or
spin off the transmission businesses, to require them to hand
grid management over to an independent operator or oblige them
to make the unit more independent through internal action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
