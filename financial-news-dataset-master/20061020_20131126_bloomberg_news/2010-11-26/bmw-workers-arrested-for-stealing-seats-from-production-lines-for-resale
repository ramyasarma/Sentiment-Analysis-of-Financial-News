A  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  worker
and an employee at a car-parts supplier were arrested Nov. 24 on
suspicion of stealing seats and fittings worth 3 million euros
($4 million) from production lines in Munich, police said.  The two detainees and another BMW employee are suspected of
faking production orders and siphoning off the parts to sell
them over the internet, Gottfried Schlicht, a Munich police
spokesman, said on the telephone. BMW spokesman  Michael Rebstock 
declined to comment.  Munich prosecutors are investigating whether as many as 15
more people were involved in transporting the products and
whether the amount stolen may be higher, Schlicht said.
Authorities began looking into the matter in early October and
have searched properties throughout the state of Bavaria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
