Treasuries rose as Yonhap News
reported that North Korea may have conducted a drill by firing
artillery near its border with South Korea.  Investors sought the relative safety of U.S. government
debt as Asian stocks fell and the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier USS Washington headed toward the Yellow Sea. North Korea
threatened a “shower of terrifying fire” should its
sovereignty be infringed.  “This will be unsettling news for the markets and be one
reason why investors would consider adding to their stocks of
liquid and safe assets, including the dollar and U.S.
Treasuries,” said  Andy Cossor , the Hong Kong-based chief market
strategist for Asia at DZ Bank AG, Germany’s fifth-largest
lender.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note fell three basis
points to 2.89 percent as of 7:14 a.m. in London, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent security due in November
2020 advanced 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 23/32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
