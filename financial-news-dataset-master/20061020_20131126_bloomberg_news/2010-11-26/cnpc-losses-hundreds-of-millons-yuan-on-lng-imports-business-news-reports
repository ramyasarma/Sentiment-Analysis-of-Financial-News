China National Petroleum Corp.  lost
hundreds of millions of yuan on liquefied natural gas imports to
help meet the country’s winter fuel demand, China Business News
 reported , citing a company official based at an LNG terminal.  CNPC lost money on six LNG cargoes recently, China Business
News said, citing an official identified only by his last name
Hong at Jiangsu LNG Terminal, owned by CNPC unit PetroChina Co.
 Liu Weijiang , the Beijing-based spokesman for CNPC, couldn’t be
immediately reached by telephone for comment.  China’s gas demand rises in winter because of increased
heating needs. Importers including CNPC and China Petrochemical
Corp. suffer losses when they buy at international rates and
sell the fuel at lower domestic prices, set by the government to
control inflation.  CNPC relies on spot cargoes during periods of peak demand
because of its insufficient gas storage capacity, China Business
News reported, citing the official. Some CNPC storage facilities
in eastern China, where demand is the strongest, will only start
operating in 2011-2012, the official was cited as saying.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Jane Lee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
