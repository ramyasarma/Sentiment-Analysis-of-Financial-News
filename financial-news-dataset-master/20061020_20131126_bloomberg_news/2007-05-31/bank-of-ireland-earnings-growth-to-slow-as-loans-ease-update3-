             Bank of Ireland Plc , the nation's
biggest mortgage lender, said earnings growth will slow as
rising  interest rates  hurt demand for home loans.  
 Earnings per share will rise by a percentage in the ``low
double digits'' in the year to the end of March 2008, Chief
Executive Officer Brian Goggin said today in an interview.
Excluding exceptional gains, earnings rose 22 percent in the
year ended March 31, 2007.  
 Irish house prices are falling and mortgage growth is slowing
after the  European Central Bank  raised interest rates seven times
since late 2005. That may hamper earnings growth for Dublin-based
Bank of Ireland, which draws 10 percent of its profits from Irish
home loans, even as Goggin cuts costs and expands in the U.K.  
 ``Improvements in efficiency are clearly positive, but are
an unsustainable source of growth,'' said  Alex Potter , a London-
based analyst at  Collins Stewart  who has a ``hold'' rating on the
stock. ``Once past March 2008, earnings growth may slow again.''  
 Bank of Ireland's shares fell 51 cents, or 3.1 percent, to
16.01 euros in Dublin. They've dropped 8.5 percent this year,
compared with the 3.5 percent increase in the Bloomberg Europe
500 Banks & Financial Services Index.  
 Net income increased to 1.64 billion euros ($2.2 billion)
in the 12 months to March 31, from 1.22 billion euros a year
earlier, the bank said. Earnings growth will ease in the coming
year after the company sold Davy Stockbrokers, pays more tax on
rising U.K. profits and as Irish home-loan growth slows.  
 Irish consumer-banking earnings rose 27 percent to 698
million euros before tax, helped by a 33 percent jump in
business loans and a 22 percent increase in mortgages. The
bank's Irish home loans will rise by as much as 17 percent in
the year to March 31, 2008, Goggin said.  
 `Robust Outlook'  
 ``After that, given the robust economic outlook for
Ireland, we'd expect annual mortgage volume growth in or around
the mid-teens so, by any standards, this is very strong
growth,'' Goggin said. The high growth rates of the past few
years are unsustainable, he added.  
 Irish mortgage lending grew at the slowest pace in almost
five years in April, the country's central bank said. Irish
 house prices , which have quadrupled over the last decade, fell
in April for a second month, while homebuilding is contracting.  
 Cost Savings  
 Against that, Goggin expects ``annualized cost savings'' of
140 million euros in the next fiscal year as the company cuts
jobs and farms out some administrative functions to companies
such as Accenture Ltd. That's 20 million euros more than the
company had forecast.  
 The bank's domestic life and pensions unit increased pretax
profit by 10 percent to 148 million euros, boosted by new
business sales.  
 Profit from corporate banking, treasury and stock broking,
rose 21 percent to 572 million euros, the bank said. In the U.K,
profit rose 26 percent to 299 million pounds ($590.7 million).  
 The bank said it will extend its joint venture with the
U.K. Post Office, which includes selling car and house
insurance, to 2020 as it seeks to expand outside Ireland. Goggin
wants to raise the bank's share of profit from its international
businesses to 50 percent from 40 percent.
