             Sniace SA (SNC) , a Spanish chemicals company
expanding into the energy industry, reaffirmed it will have three
bioethanol plants working in 2009.  
 Sniace is building two bioethanol plants in Spain, which may
start operating at the end of 2008, and another in  Poland . The
Madrid-based company is investing about 250 million euros ($338
million) in the facilities.  
 ``Europe is going to have a really big market for
bioethanol,'' Chairman Blas Mezquita said in an interview in Madrid
today.  
 Sniace aims to generate as much as 50 percent of its revenue
from energy-related businesses in three years. Bioethanol, made by
fermenting crops like wheat, can be mixed with gasoline to fuel
cars and planes, helping to curb the use of oil-based gasoline.
Sniace is planning to more than double its revenue by starting the
three plants.  
 The two Spanish plants will produce about 220,000 tons of
ethanol a year, the Polish one 200,000 tons. Mezquita said the
venture-capital firm Cantabria Capital will take a stake of as much
as 30 percent in the plant being built in Torrelavega, in northern
Spain.  
 Separately, Mezquita said shareholder Grupo Kiluva may raise
its stake beyond the 3.3 percent the owner of health-food stores
already owns. He did not give more details.  
 Sniace's largest shareholder, Hidafa SA, has no plans to
increase its stake, now almost 25 percent, he said.
