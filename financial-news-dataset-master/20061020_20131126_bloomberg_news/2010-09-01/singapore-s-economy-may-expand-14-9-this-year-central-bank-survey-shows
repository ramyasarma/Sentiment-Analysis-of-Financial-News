             Singapore’s economy will probably
grow at a faster pace than previously forecast this year as
manufacturers boost output and consumers increase spending, a
central bank survey showed.  
 Gross domestic product  may expand 14.9 percent in 2010,
according to the median forecast in a survey of 20 economists by
the  Monetary Authority of Singapore  released today. That
compares with a June estimate of 9 percent. The Southeast Asian
nation may expand 5 percent in 2011, the survey showed.  
 Singapore’s economy is in the running to be the world’s
fastest-expanding in 2010 as rising demand for goods and
services prompted the government to raise growth forecasts three
times this year. The central bank said in April it will allow
the currency to strengthen after the economy grew at the fastest
pace on record in the first quarter.  
 The economy will probably expand 11.6 percent this quarter
from a year earlier, extending the island’s recovery from last
year’s recession, the survey showed.  GDP  rose 18.8 percent in
the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier.  
 Singapore’s government expects the economy to grow as much
as 15 percent this year, after a record expansion of 17.9
percent in the first half.  
 Manufacturing will probably increase 28.7 percent in 2010,
the survey showed, compared with the economists’ previous
prediction of a 16.7 percent gain.  Non-oil domestic exports  may
jump 19.5 percent this year, according to the median forecast,
higher than the government’s estimate for shipments to rise as
much as 19 percent in 2010.  
 Construction Growth  
 Economists were less optimistic on the outlook for
Singapore’s building industry than they were in last quarter’s
survey. Construction will advance 10 percent this year, less
than a previous estimate for a 10.3 percent gain, they
predicted.  
 Private consumption may climb 5.8 percent in 2010, while
financial services may increase 10.6 percent, according to the
median estimates.  
 Singapore’s  unemployment rate  may be 2.2 percent by the end
of 2010, higher than the June projection of 2 percent, the
survey showed. The city-state has added about 63,000 new jobs
this year and the jobless rate is at 2.3 percent.  
 Consumer prices will probably rise 2.9 percent this year,
according to the survey. The central bank, which uses its
currency rather than interest rates to manage price gains,
forecasts inflation will average 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.  
 The Singapore dollar will probably end this quarter at
S$1.363 versus the U.S. currency, and may strengthen to S$1.35
by the end of 2010, the survey showed. It traded at 1.354 a
dollar at 11:36 a.m. local time.
