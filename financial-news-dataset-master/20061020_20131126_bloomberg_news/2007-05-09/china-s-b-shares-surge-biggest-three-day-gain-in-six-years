             China 's foreign-currency B shares rose
to a record, completing the biggest three-day gain in more than
six years, as their discount to yuan-denominated A shares drew
local investors.  
 The  Shanghai (SHBSHR)  B-Share Index jumped 6.9 percent to 269.99 at
3 p.m. local time close, after surging 17 percent in the past
two trading days. That's the largest three-day rally since March
2001. The Shenzhen B-Share Index added 4.8 percent to 713.53.
Both indexes are at the highest they've been since they were
introduced in 1992.  
 Shanghai  Lujiazui Finance & Trade Zone Development Co., a
real estate developer in Shanghai's financial district, jumped
by the 10 percent limit to $2.25. The developer's B shares are
valued at 54 times earnings, versus 87 times for their A shares.  
 Dazhong Transportation (Group) Co., which operates
Shanghai's second-biggest taxi fleet, climbed by the 10 percent
daily limit to $1.65. The company's B shares are valued at 62
times earnings, compared with 128 times for the A shares.  
 ``People have flocked to open new accounts to buy B shares
for gains,'' said Lu Jiehua, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo
Research and Consulting Co. in Shanghai. ``B shares are likely
to extend rallies as long as A shares keep rising.''  
 B shares, which can only be bought and sold by domestic
individuals and overseas investors, are traded in U.S. dollars
in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in  Shenzhen. (SZBSHR)  Overseas
investors are restricted from buying China's yuan-denominated A
shares, which are more heavily traded.  
 China's B-share market was set up in 1992 to give local
companies a way to raise funds from foreign investors, who were
banned from buying securities denominated in  yuan . The
government's 2003 decision to ease the ban starved the B-share
market, which hasn't had an initial stock sale in three years.
