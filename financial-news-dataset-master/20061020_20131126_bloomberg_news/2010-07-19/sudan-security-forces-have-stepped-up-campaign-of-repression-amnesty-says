             Sudan’s security forces have stepped
up a campaign of intimidation, detention and torture of anyone
seen as opposing the government, Amnesty International said in a
report on its website today.  
 The National Intelligence and Security Service has
“attempted to silence all voices critical of the ruling
National Congress Party,” the London-based human rights
organization said. “The legitimate exercise of the rights to
freedom of expression and association has been repressed by a
clampdown on human rights defenders, journalists and any
dissident voice.”  
 President  Umar al-Bashir  was charged with genocide last
week by the International Criminal Court, adding to accusations
of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his actions in the
western province of Darfur. Al-Bashir has denied the charges and
refuses to recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC.  
 Since 2008, Sudan has witnessed increased and extensive
human rights violations, mainly perpetrated by the NISS, Amnesty
said. The violations include arbitrary and incommunicado
detention, “torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and
degrading treatment,” according to the report.  
 Amnesty International has not been allowed to visit
northern Sudan since 2006, it said.
