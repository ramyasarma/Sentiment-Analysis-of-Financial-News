             Colombia’s economy won’t be affected
by a dispute with Venezuela because trade between the countries
is already so low, Colombian Finance Minister  Oscar Ivan Zuluaga 
said.  
 “How much more can it fall?” Zuluaga told reporters in
Bogota today. “The effect on the economy is almost zero.”  
 Colombia’s government said July 15 that it has satellite
photos, video and intelligence from guerrilla deserters that
prove Colombian rebel commanders are living in Venezuela. They
include those known by the aliases as Ivan Marquez and
Timochenko, who are members of the high command of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.  
 Trade between the two nations plunged in 2009 following a
dispute about the U.S. military’s presence in Colombia. Exports
from South America’s fourth-biggest economy to Venezuela
 declined 71 percent  in the first five months of 2010 from the
same period a year earlier. Before relations soured, Venezuela
was Colombia’s biggest export market after the U.S.  
 Venezuela may stop importing Colombian goods if the
accusations persist, Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said.  
 “If this continues, trade will become zero,” Chavez said
July 16. “We won’t buy anything from Colombia.”  
 Colombia’s peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,875.40 per
dollar at 2:36 p.m. New York time from 1877.85 on July 16.
