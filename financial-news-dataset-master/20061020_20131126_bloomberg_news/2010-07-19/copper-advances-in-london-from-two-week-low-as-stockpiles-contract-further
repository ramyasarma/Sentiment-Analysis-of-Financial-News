             Copper prices rose from the lowest
level in almost two weeks after inventories dropped for the 22nd
straight session, matching this year’s longest slump.  
 Stockpiles monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange fell 0.8
percent today to 422,850 metric tons, the lowest level since
Nov. 20. Supplies are down 16 percent this year, signaling that
demand has been steady amid reports suggesting the global
economy is cooling.  
 “A slowing in momentum of growth does not mean that the
global economy is heading toward imminent disaster, and in some
economies, it is a welcome sign to avoid overheating,”  Barclays
Capital  in London said in a report. “We would recommend buying
copper on dips.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery rose 0.85 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.938 a pound on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the metal touched $2.925, the lowest level for a most-
active contract since July 6. The price has dropped 12 percent
this year.  
 The metal pared gains of as much as 1.1 percent today after
a private report showed confidence among builders in the U.S.
fell to the lowest level since April 2009. Construction accounts
for a quarter of all copper consumption, according to the Copper
Development Association.  
 “Housing is still an important factor for copper, so any
weakness there will have an impact on prices,” said Gijsbert Groenewegen, a partner at Gold Arrow Capital Management in New
York. “Copper is in a wait-and-see mode. The next few weeks
will be crucial in terms of gauging demand.”  
 Copper for delivery in three months rose $25, or 0.4
percent, to $6,510 a metric ton ($2.95 a pound) on the LME.  
 Tin, lead and zinc also gained in London. Aluminum and
nickel fell.
