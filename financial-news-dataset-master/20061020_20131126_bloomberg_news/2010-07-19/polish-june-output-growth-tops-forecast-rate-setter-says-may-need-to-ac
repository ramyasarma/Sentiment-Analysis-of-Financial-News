             Polish industrial output expanded
for an eighth month in June, outpacing economists’ estimates and
prompting a policy maker to predict interest rates may rise if
such growth is sustained.  
 Output increased 14.5 percent after gaining a revised 13.5
percent in May, the  Central Statistical Office  in Warsaw said
today. The figure exceeded median estimate of 12.4 percent by
nine economists in a Bloomberg survey. On the month, output rose
7 percent.  
 Poland’s economy expanded 3 percent in the first quarter
and may have matched that rate in the second on a manufacturing
rebound, according to Finance Ministry forecasts. Export orders
pushed Poland’s June Purchasing Managers Index to 53.3, the
highest since August 2007, HSBC Holdings Plc said. June auto
output jumped 16 percent to 84,257 units, the biggest monthly
production in 15 months, Warsaw-based researcher  Samar  reported.  
 “Economic growth may exceed 4 percent next year if this
trend continues,”  Andrzej Kazmierczak  of the central bank’s
Monetary Policy Council said by phone after the data were
published. “That means inflation will accelerate and we will
have to take action to defend our inflation target.”  
 Producer prices , an early indicator of inflation trends,
grew 1.9 percent in June from the previous year, increasing for
the second consecutive month after declining from February to
April. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of eight
economists was for an increase of 1.7 percent following May’s
revised 1.9 percent rise.  
 The zloty weakened against the euro to 4.1273 at 2:13 p.m.,
down 0.5 percent on the day. The yield on the benchmark five-
year Treasury bond maturing in April 2015 was up 5 basis points
at 5.46 percent.
