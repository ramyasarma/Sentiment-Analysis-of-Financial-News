             German tax revenue increased in June
as Europe’s biggest economy expanded at a “significantly
stronger” pace in the second quarter than in the first three
months, the Finance Ministry said in its monthly report.  
 June tax intake rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier,
bringing the 6-month total to 235 billion euros ($305 billion),
the ministry said. Half-year revenue fell 0.9 percent from the
same period in 2009, said the ministry, which expects full-year
returns to decline 2.6 percent.  
 “The German economy is on the road to recovery,” the
ministry in Berlin said today. “Current data show that economic
activity in the second quarter of 2010 should have grown
significantly more strongly than in the first quarter.”  
 German companies are stepping up  output  as an Asian-led
global recovery boosts export orders, in turn encouraging
consumer demand and spurring tax intake.  Retail sales  rose in
May as the economic recovery gathered pace and  unemployment 
retreated.  
 “Dynamism in the industrial sector has increased
noticeably,” helped by demand for German machinery on the back
of widening production in Asian emerging economies, the ministry
said. “The economic recovery should strengthen in the second
half.”
