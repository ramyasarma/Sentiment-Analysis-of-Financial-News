             Robert Benmosche , the  American
International Group Inc.  chief executive officer who replaced
the head of the insurer’s main Asia unit, said the change was
needed to prepare for the division’s initial public offering.  
 Mark Tucker  was named head of AIA Group Ltd. today,
replacing  Mark Wilson , 43. Tucker has 15 years of experience
building the Asia operations of competitor Prudential Plc,
Benmosche told employees today in a letter obtained by
Bloomberg. AIG is proceeding with an IPO of the Hong Kong-based
business after a $35.5 billion agreement to sell AIA to
Prudential collapsed in May.  
 “It is critical that we put the best team on the field to
ensure the success of AIA’s IPO,” Benmosche said in the memo.
“Taking a company public is not easy, and we all will need to
work well together to succeed. The experience of public
investors holding you accountable for results also will be a new
challenge.”  
 Benmosche, 66, overhauled AIA’s  management  after clashing
with directors on how to divest the business to repay AIG’s
$182.3 billion bailout. The CEO demanded more control over AIA
last month at a board meeting, pushing for Wilson’s dismissal,
said a person with knowledge of the event.  Harvey Golub  stepped
down last week as chairman after the board rejected a reduced
bid from Prudential that Benmosche had supported.  
 ‘Ready to Go’  
 The unit’s public offering would be “ready to go in the
coming months when market conditions are optimal,” Benmosche
said in the letter, adding that he couldn’t speculate about the
precise timing. Wilson will assist Tucker, 52, through the end
of this year, AIG said.  
 Wilson had spoken directly to board members to advocate for
an IPO of AIA, according to the person. Benmosche had pushed for
Prudential’s revised $30.4 billion bid for the business after
the London-based insurer’s  investors  had balked at the original
$35.5 billion price.  
 “Wilson was undoubtedly aware that he was running risks by
going around Benmosche to the board,” said  Clark Troy , an
analyst for research firm Aite Group. Benmosche is “trying to
limit the exodus to those parties very close to Wilson.”  
 AIA has more than 23 million customers and offices in at
least 15 countries including China, India and Australia.
Benmosche plans to focus on global property-casualty coverage
and U.S. life and retirement services after divesting AIA and
another non-U.S. life unit.
