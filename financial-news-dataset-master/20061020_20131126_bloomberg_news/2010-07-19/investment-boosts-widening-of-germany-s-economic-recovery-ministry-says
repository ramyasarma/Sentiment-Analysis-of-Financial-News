             The economic recovery in Germany is
widening, showing strong growth in the second quarter, the
Economy Ministry said today in its monthly report.  
 Exports, industrial investment and construction orders are
driving growth in Europe’s biggest economy, the ministry said.
At the same time, the European debt crisis and “overheating”
in some developing countries pose risks to the recovery, it
said.  
 The recovery hasn’t yet spread to private consumption in
the second quarter, the ministry said.
