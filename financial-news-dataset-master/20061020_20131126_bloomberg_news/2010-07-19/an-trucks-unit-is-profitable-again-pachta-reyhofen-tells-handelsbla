             MAN SE’s commercial vehicles unit
has returned to a profit and will probably post positive
earnings for the full year, Handelsblatt reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Georg Pachta-Reyhofen.  
 Pachta-Reyhofen said the unit has been profitable since
March, according to the newspaper. The trucks division is
targeting a production rate of 50,000 vehicles in Europe this
year, about 10,000 more than in 2009, as it benefits from an
increase in new orders, Handelsblatt said.  
 It is targeting 50,000 in Latin America, according to the
newspaper.
