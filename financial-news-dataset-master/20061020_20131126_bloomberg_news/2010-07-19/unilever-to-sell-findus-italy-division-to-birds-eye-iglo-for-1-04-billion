             Unilever , the world’s second-biggest
consumer goods maker, agreed to sell its Italian frozen-foods
unit to a group led by Birds Eye Iglo for 805 million euros
($1.04 billion) as it focuses on building international brands.  
 Birds Eye Iglo, which is owned by private-equity firm
Permira Advisers LLP, has a “significant stake” in the buyer
of Findus, Unilever said in a statement. Permira arranged about
500 million euros of leveraged loans to fund the acquisition,
according to two people familiar with the deal.  
 “The proceeds are a little bit better than anticipated,”
said  Gerard Rijk , an  analyst  at ING in Amsterdam, adding that he
had expected a deal of 490 million euros to 630 million euros.
“This is a divestment of a low-growth area, so the company is
continuing on its strategy and is executing quite well.”  
 Unilever, which makes Dove body wash and Liptons tea, is
selling Findus as it  shifts away  from local labels to focus on
international brands to increase profit and reach its goal of
doubling sales. The unit, which had revenue of 462 million euros
in 2009, is the company’s last non-ice cream frozen-food
business in Europe.  
 Stronger Position  
 Unilever is now “in a stronger position to focus on its
core categories outside frozen foods and to achieve long-term
growth in the Italian market,” James Hill, chairman of the
London- and Rotterdam-based company’s Italian unit, said in the
statement. About 650 employees will transfer to Birds Eye.  
 Unilever plans to buy  Sara Lee Corp .’s shower gel and
European detergents business for $1.7 billion in its first major
takeover in nine years. The acquisition would add the Sanex soap
brand and enable Unilever to sell more personal-care products in
Europe. The company has earmarked 1 billion euros to 2 billion
euros a year for so-called bolt-on acquisitions.  
 Unilever sold most of its European frozen foods unit, which
included the Iglo and Birds Eye brands, to Permira Funds for
1.73 billion euros in 2006. The Findus unit price is “quite
high for a low-growth entity,” Rijk said today, “but Birds Eye
Iglo can reap synergies as they are already active in this
business.”  
 Chris Davison , a London-based spokesman for Permira,
confirmed that the Findus acquisition is being funded through
debt and equity. He declined to comment further.  
 Unilever’s  shares  were up 1.2 percent at 23.30 euros at 2
p.m.in Amsterdam.
