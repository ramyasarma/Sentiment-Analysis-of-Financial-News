             Emirates Telecommunications Corp  may
buy 26 percent of Reliance Communications Ltd., a stake
estimated to be worth $3 billion, as early as mid-August, the
Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the talks.  
 Both sides are considering merging the Indian unit of
Etisalat, as the Abu Dhabi-based phone carrier is known, with
Reliance because of domestic rules that bar companies from
owning more than 10 percent of two telecommunications companies,
the newspaper said. Reliance and Etisalat declined to comment on
any specific negotiations, according to the report.  
 A merger wouldn’t be simple because takeover rules in India
discourage such a combination, the newspaper cited HSBC Holdings
Plc analyst  Rajiv Sharma  as saying.  
 A purchase would help Etisalat expand its presence in
India, the world’s second-largest mobile-phone market after
China, as increased competition drives down the company’s
earnings. A sale would follow Reliance’s agreement last month to
sell its wireless-towers to GTL Infrastructure Ltd. and reduce
debt.  
 Etisalat Chairman  Mohammed Omran  said last month investing
in Reliance is among several options the United Arab Emirates
company is considering to expand in India. The phone operator
said in January it plans to raise its stake in Etisalat DB,
formerly called Swan Telecom, to one share above 50 percent from
45 percent.
