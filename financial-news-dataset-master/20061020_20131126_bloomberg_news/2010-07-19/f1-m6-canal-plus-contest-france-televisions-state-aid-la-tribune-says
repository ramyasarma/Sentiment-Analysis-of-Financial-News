             Societe Television Francaise 1, M6-
Metropole Television SA and Canal Plus have filed a complaint
with a European court in Luxembourg against 450 million euros of
French state aid to state-run broadcaster France Televisions SA,
La Tribune reported, without citing anyone.  
 The companies are contesting the European Commission’s
decision to validate the aid on Sept. 1, 2009, the newspaper
said.
