             European  construction output  dropped
for a second month in May, led by declines in Germany.  
 Construction  in the 16-nation euro region fell 1 percent
from April, when it decreased 0.3 percent, the European Union’s 
statistics office  in Luxembourg said today. From a year earlier,
 output  in May dropped 6.3 percent after falling 5.7 percent in
April.  
 Builders across Europe may struggle to shore up output
after the Greek fiscal crisis forced governments to withdraw
stimulus measures and cut spending. While the euro-area economy
is showing signs of strengthening, the European Central Bank
said on July 15 that a recovery will remain “moderate”
overall.  
 The euro was little changed against the dollar after the
data, trading at $1.2962 at 10:03 a.m. in London, up 0.3 percent
on the day.  
 In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, construction output
fell 2.3 percent in May from the previous month, when it rose
2.5 percent, today’s report showed. In France, output remained
unchanged while Spanish construction fell 1 percent.  
 HeidelbergCement AG , the world’s third-largest cement
maker, said last month that it aims to revive profit with
spending cuts and by adding plants in emerging markets after its
first-quarter loss widened amid the coldest winter in decades.
The Heidelberg, Germany-based company eliminated 7,500 jobs, or
12 percent of the  workforce , last year as reorganization costs
contributed to a 98 percent plunge in 2009  profit .  
 In the 27-member EU, output dropped 0.6 percent from April,
when it increased 0.5 percent, the statistics office said.
