             Eskom Holdings Ltd., South Africa’s
state-owned power supplier, said nine of 11 Free State province
municipalities that were in arrears have settled their accounts.  
 The remaining two have until midnight local time to pay,
Andrew Etzinger, a spokesman for the Johannesburg-based utility,
said today by telephone from the city. They are Ngwathe, which
governs the town of Heilbron, and Mafube, which manages
Frankfort, Cornelia and Tweeling, he said.  
 Eskom, struggling to secure funds for an expansion project,
said July 7 it may cut electricity to the municipalities if they
don’t settle accounts by July 20. The offices of the two
municipalities had already closed when Bloomberg News contacted
them today.
