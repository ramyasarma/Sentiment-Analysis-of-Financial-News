             AvalonBay Communities Inc ., the
second-biggest publicly traded apartment landlord in the U.S.,
plans to submit a bid to build part of New York City’s largest
affordable housing project in almost four decades.  
 The company will respond to a  public request  issued last
month by New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and
Development for the construction of as many as 1,000 apartments
in the Queens neighborhood of Hunter’s Point, President  Tim Naughton  said yesterday in an interview. AvalonBay already owns
about 1,000 apartments in Long Island City, near the site.  
 “We’re sort of obvious bidders,” Naughton said. “It’s an
attractive location for us. We’d like to invest more capital and
we think we have a competitive leg up from most of the market.”  
 The bid would be on the first phase of a planned complex of
as many as 5,000 apartments, according to the Department of
Housing Preservation’s website. The total project is set to be
the largest development of affordable rental housing since the
completion of the 5,881-unit Starrett City in Brooklyn in 1974,
said Eric Bederman, a spokesman for the housing department.  
 Hunter’s Point is located on the  waterfront site  designated
for the Olympic Village in New York’s failed quest to host the
2012 games. The housing department is seeking to sell two city-
owned parcels to a developer that will build about 1,000 units
of housing, 60 percent of which will be “permanently
affordable,” according to its June  press release .  
 Middle Income  
 Bid proposals must designate units for middle-income
households, which the department defines as families earning 80
percent to 165 percent of the area median income, or $63,000 to
$130,000 for a family of four. The income range for a single-
person household would be $44,000 to $91,000, according to
numbers provided by Bederman.  
 The city is offering development incentives that include as
much as $90,000 per unit of affordable housing, according to its
request for  proposals . It is accepting bids through Sept. 7.  
 “The city has been very realistic about the level of
incentives that are needed to produce that amount of affordable
housing,” said  Fred Harris , AvalonBay’s senior vice president
for development in the New York region.  
 AvalonBay’s proposal probably will include at least 700
apartments, Harris said.  
 “It’s at least two buildings, and could be as many as
four,” Harris said of the company’s plans for the site.  
 New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg set a goal in 2003 to
build or preserve 165,000 units housing for low- and moderate-
income households by 2013. The administration extended the
deadline by a year in 2008 as a consequence of the U.S. economic
recession and banks’ reluctance to lend.  
 The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  
 AvalonBay, based in Alexandria, Virginia, owned or held an
interest in 172 apartment communities composed of more than
50,000 units at the end of the first quarter, according to its
website. It has development rights at 29 additional locations.
