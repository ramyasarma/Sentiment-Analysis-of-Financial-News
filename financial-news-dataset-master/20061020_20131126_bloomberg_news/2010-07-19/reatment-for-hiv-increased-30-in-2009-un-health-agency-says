             The number of people receiving
treatment for  HIV  rose 30 percent in 2009, the biggest leap in a
single year, according to the World Health Organization.  
 About 5.2 million people were receiving treatment for the
AIDS-causing virus in 2009, up from 4 million in 2008, the
United Nations health agency, also known as  WHO , said today in
an e-mailed  statement .  
 WHO is pushing for earlier treatment of HIV at this week’s
International AIDS Conference in Vienna, stating that early use
of medicines also acts as a preventative measure by reducing
levels of the virus in the body, so carriers are less likely to
pass on the disease. HIV-related deaths could be reduced by 20
percent in the next five years if guidelines for early treatment
are implemented, according to WHO.  
 “Starting treatment earlier gives us an opportunity to
enable people living with HIV to stay healthier and live
longer,” said Gottfried Hirnschall, WHO director of HIV and
AIDS, in the statement.  
 Results last week from a study of 816 HIV patients by the
New England Journal of Medicine showed that early treatment of
HIV cut the risk of death by 75 percent.
