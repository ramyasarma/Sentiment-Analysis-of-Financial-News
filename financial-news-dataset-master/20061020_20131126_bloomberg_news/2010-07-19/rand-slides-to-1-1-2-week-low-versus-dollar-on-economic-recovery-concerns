             South Africa’s rand weakened to a 1
1/2-week low against the dollar as signs the global economic
recovery is faltering damped investors’ demand for high-yield
assets from emerging markets.  
 The rand declined as much as 0.9 percent to 7.6625 per
dollar, the weakest since July 7, and traded at 7.6257 by 9:40
a.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.5924.  
 Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Ireland’s debt rating
citing weak government finances while the International Monetary
Fund and European Union ended talks with Hungary without
endorsing government plans to reduce the budget deficit. A
report on July 16 showed a gauge of U.S. consumer confidence
sank to the lowest in a year, raising concern the world’s
biggest economy is slowing.  
 “For South Africa, lackluster global demand will weigh on
gross domestic product growth prospects,”  Standard Bank Group
Ltd.  analysts  Michael Keenan  and Nomvuyo Guma, wrote in a client
note today. “In the short term the data may exacerbate the
negative global sentiment, which is bearish for the rand.”  
 The rand slid versus all but one of its 16 most-actively
traded currencies monitored by Bloomberg, losing 0.7 percent
against the euro to 9.8807. The rand lost 0.7 percent against
the pound to 11.6961.  
 Government bonds fell in South Africa, with the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 dropping 4 cents to 124
rand. The yield on the bond rose less than 1 basis point to 7.75
percent.  
 Investors increased bets that South Africa’s central bank
may lower its 6.5 percent benchmark interest rate when it next
meets on July 22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of
 three-month contracts for cash in one month  declined 1 basis
point to 6.40 percent.
