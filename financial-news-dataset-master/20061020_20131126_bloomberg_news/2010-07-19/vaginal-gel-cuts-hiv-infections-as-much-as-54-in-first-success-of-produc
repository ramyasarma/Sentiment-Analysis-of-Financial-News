             A vaginal gel containing Gilead
Sciences Inc.’s AIDS drug Viread cut HIV infections by as much
as 54 percent in a trial in South Africa, the first time such a
product has protected users after six previous gels failed.  
 Among 445 women who applied the gel before and after sex,
there were 39 percent fewer HIV infections overall than among
those who used a placebo gel, according to the results of the
trial to be presented at the International AIDS Conference in
Vienna tomorrow. There were 54 percent fewer infections among
those who used the gel more than 80 percent of the time and a 28
percent reduction among those who used it least.
