             A Kenyan pastor pleaded innocent to
two charges in connection with an alleged plot to bomb a
gathering in the city of Mombasa planned by supporters of a
draft constitution, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  
 The clergyman, John Kamau Mbugua, who is a local official
in President  Mwai Kibaki ’s party, was arrested July 17 and
charged with possessing fertilizer and a detonator for an attack
on a rally before the Aug. 4 referendum, the BBC said. Two men
charged with Mbugua pleaded guilty today to possessing
explosives and denied planning to hurt people, the BBC said.  
 Six people were killed last month in an attack on a
referendum rally, the BBC reported. The draft law, which Kibaki
favors, is opposed by some Kenyan churches because it recognizes
Muslim courts, the broadcaster reported.  
 Clashes followed disputed elections in December 2007, and
left an estimated 1,500 people dead. The clashes stopped with
the signing of a power-sharing accord that left Kibaki as
president and named his rival,  Raila Odinga , as prime minister.
The agreement called for the drafting of a new constitution.
