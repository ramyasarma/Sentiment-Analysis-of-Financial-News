             Heat that damaged grain plantings
will persist in central Russia and along the Volga River through
July 23rd, with rains coming to Siberia and southern parts of
the country, the Federal Hydrometeorological Service said.  
 “Abnormal” heat, with temperatures rising to as high as
36 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit), will prevail in
most parts of central Russia, the forecaster said on its  website 
today. Temperatures in the Saratov region along the Volga will
rise as high as 37 degrees through July 21.  
 Southern parts of the drought-hit Volga region, as well as
some areas in southern Russia, will get rain and thunderstorms
today, the center said. Five Siberian areas, including the
area’s bread-basket, the Altai region, will also see heavy rains
and thunderstorms today.  
 The government declared emergencies in 17 crop-producing
regions because of the worst drought in at least a decade.
