             Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  will announce plans later this month to
ease capital controls, newspaper Ambito Financiero reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  
 The government plans to remove a requirement, dating to
2005, that investors bringing money into the country must
deposit 30 percent of the funds with the central bank for a
year, the newspaper said. Instead, investors will be required to
keep their money in Argentina for at least a year, Ambito said.  
 A message left at the Economy Ministry press office by
Bloomberg News wasn’t immediately returned.
