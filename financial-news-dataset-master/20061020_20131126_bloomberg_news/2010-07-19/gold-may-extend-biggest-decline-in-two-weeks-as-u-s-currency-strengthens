             Gold may drop, extending the biggest
fall in almost two weeks, as the dollar gains, curbing demand
for the metal as a store of value.  
 Bullion for immediate delivery declined as much as 0.2
percent to $1,191.05 an ounce before trading little changed at
$1,192.65 at 1:44 p.m. in Singapore. The  Dollar Index  gained for
the first day in five after U.S. equities fell on July 16 and
U.K. home sellers cut prices for the first time this year. Gold
declined 1.3 percent that day, closing at $1,193.  
 “Gold remains in a corrective mode even though sporadic
physical buying from Asia may moderate the price fall,” said
 Wallace Ng , a Hong Kong-based executive director at ABN Amro
Bank NV. “The longer-term bullish trend is still intact and
gold prices will find support near $1,155.”  
 The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
six counterparts, climbed as much as 0.4 percent today, gaining
for the first time since July 12. The indicator, which typically
moves inversely to gold prices, has gained 6.2 percent this year.  
 Reports this week may show that the U.S. housing market
deteriorated in June. Builders began work on houses last month
at the slowest pace this year, according to the median estimate
of 61 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before Commerce
Department data due July 20. Other reports may show sales of
existing homes fell for a second month and an index of leading
indicators declined for the first time in more than a year.  
 Rising Trend  
 Gold is on course for a 10th straight annual advance, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920, as investors seek to
protect their wealth from Europe’s financial turbulence, which
weakened the euro and threatened the global economic recovery.
Gold reached a record $1,265.30 an ounce last month.  
 Sixteen of 24 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 67 percent, said bullion will climb this week.
Three forecast lower prices and five were neutral. Gold will
average $1,195 an ounce this year, Barclays Capital said on July
16 in a report, compared with a previous estimate of $1,166.  
 “Gold below $1,200 will be attractive to investors seeking
to accumulate,” said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte. “On a cautious note, should we see a sustained breach of
$1,185, this may prompt another selloff.”  
 Holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at 1,314.21 metric
tons on July 16, according to figures on the company’s website.  
 Silver for immediate delivery and platinum were little
changed at $17.8525 an ounce and $1,508 an ounce, respectively.
Palladium climbed 1 percent to $454.33 an ounce.
