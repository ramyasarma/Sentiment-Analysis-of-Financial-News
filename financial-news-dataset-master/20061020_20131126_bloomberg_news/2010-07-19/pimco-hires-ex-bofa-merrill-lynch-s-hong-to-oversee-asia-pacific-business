             Pacific Investment Management Co.,
which runs the world’s largest mutual  fund , named  Ki Myung Hong 
as head of the company’s Asia-Pacific operations.  
 Hong, who will be based in Hong Kong, will oversee the
company’s business in the city, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo,
Pimco said in a statement released through Marketwire. He will
report to  Douglas Hodge , the chief operating officer of the
Newport Beach, California-based firm.  
 Hong was most recently regional vice chairman and president
of Asia-Pacific at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, based in Hong
Kong. Previously, he was Asia co-head of credit and rates with a
focus on clients for JPMorgan & Co. also in the city. He held
senior positions with Bankers Trust over the course of a 13-year
career there.  
 Pimco’s $234 billion Total Return Fund, run by  Bill Gross ,
handed investors a 12 percent gain in the past year, beating
about three-fifths of its competitors, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Pimco has about $1.1 trillion in assets
and is a unit of Munich-based insurer Allianz SE.
