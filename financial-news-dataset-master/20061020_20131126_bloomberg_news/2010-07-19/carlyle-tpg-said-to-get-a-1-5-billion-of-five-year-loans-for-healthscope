             Carlyle Group and TPG Capital
arranged about A$1.5 billion ($1.3 billion) in five-year loans
from 17 banks to help fund their purchase of Australia’s
 Healthscope Ltd. , according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Barclays Plc,
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, HSBC Holdings Plc and UBS AG are
among the banks, the person said, asking not to be named as the
details are private.  
 An amortizing portion of the loan will pay 425 basis points
over the BBSY rate, and a second tranche with a bullet repayment
schedule will pay 450 basis points over the same benchmark,
another person familiar with the deal said.  
 Carlyle, based in Washington, and TPG of Fort Worth, Texas
agreed to buy Healthscope for A$2.7 billion including debt, the
hospital operator said today. Healthscope surged as much as 11
percent after the announcement ended two months of speculation
on details of the buyout, which would be Australia’s largest in
eight years.  
 Sue Cato, who represents the Carlyle and TPG partnership as
head of public relations firm Cato Counsel, declined to comment
on the debt component of the bid.
