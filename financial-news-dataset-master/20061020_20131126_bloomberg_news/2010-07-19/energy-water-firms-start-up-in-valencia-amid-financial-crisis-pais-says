             Energy and water companies increased
in number during the worst months of the financial crisis in 
Spain’s Valencia region while more than 7,000 construction 
firms closed their doors, El Pais reported.  
 Nine hundred eighty-two energy and water enterprises were 
formed from the end of 2007 to the end of 2009, bringing their 
total to 2,406, helped by renewable power start-ups, according 
to the newspaper, which cited the local chamber of commerce.    
 During the same time, 7,249 construction companies shut 
down, or 71 percent of the total closings in the region that 
borders the Mediterranean Sea, leaving their total at 25,420, 
El Pais reported.  
 The figures should be treated with caution, because a 
"microcompany" counted as much as a factory with 500 workers, 
Jose Vicente Morata, chairman of the chamber, said in the 
article.
