             U.S. officials need to outline more
clearly their plans to reduce the nation’s fiscal deficit, said
 Stephen Roach , Morgan Stanley’s non-executive chairman for Asia.  
 “What the markets are ultimately going to want is far more
specificity and credibility on deficit reduction and
normalization of Fed policy,” Roach, 64, said during a radio
interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Surveillance.  
 President  Barack Obama  said on July 15 his economic-
stimulus program is gradually pulling the U.S. out of the
economic slump. The nation’s budget deficit is forecast to swell
14 percent this year to a record $1.6 trillion. Obama has said
he will offset spending by more than $1.2 trillion over 10
years, partly through a freeze on many domestic programs and
more than $800 million in higher taxes and fees on households
earning more than $250,000.  
 The Federal Reserve has kept the benchmark interest rate at
a record low range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  
 By focusing on stimulus now and budget cuts later, “the
president is walking a fine line,” said Roach, who also a
professor at Yale University.  
 “There is good reason to suspect that when we get through
this year or next year, the strategy in Washington is just to
keep kicking the can down the road,” he said.  
 During the Reagan administration, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
Balanced Budget Act “forced us into a mode of fiscal
consolidation,” Roach said. The act imposed automatic spending
cuts if deficit targets were missed.  
 “We definitely need some hard and fast rules that help us
get out of this mess we are in,” Roach said.
