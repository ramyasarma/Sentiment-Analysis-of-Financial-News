             Australia’s resources industry faces
the threat of a skills shortage by late 2011 to early 2012,
especially in Western Australia and Queensland, a government-
appointed labor task force said in a report.  
 Australia has some 75 planned mining and energy projects
with a combined value of about A$110 billion, as of April, the
National Resources Sector Employment Taskforce said on its
website.  
 Resources projects may be short of 36,000 trades workers by
2015, the taskforce said.
