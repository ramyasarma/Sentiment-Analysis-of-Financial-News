             Gem Diamonds Ltd. , a miner of the
precious stones in Lesotho and Australia, fell the most in six
weeks in London trading after first-half production in Australia
missed company forecasts.  
 “Plant availability and rain hampered plant throughput
from March to June and has resulted in an underperformance
against targets,” London-based Gem Diamonds said today in a
statement. “Both tonnage treated and carats recovered are
likely to be slightly below target for the full year.”  
 Gem  fell as much as 7.4 percent, the steepest intraday
decline since June 1, and traded down 4.5 percent at 211 pence
as of 8:46 a.m. local time.
