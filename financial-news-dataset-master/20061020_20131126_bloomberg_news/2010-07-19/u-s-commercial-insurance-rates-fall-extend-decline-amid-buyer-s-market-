             U.S. commercial insurance rates fell
6.4 percent in the second quarter, accelerating their decline
from the prior period, as customers demand less coverage and
more carriers enter the market, an industry group said.  
 The decline compares with a 5.3 drop in the quarter ended
March 31, the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers said today
in a  report  posted on its website. Accounts generating more than
$100,000 in commissions and fees had the biggest drop at 8.9
percent, the group said.  
 “Carriers continue to fight aggressively for new business
as capacity flows into the market,” Council President  Ken A. Crerar  said in the statement. “It’s like someone forgot to turn
off the spigot. No one seems to know when the reservoir will dry
up, but in the meantime, it’s definitely a buyers’ market.”  
 Commercial insurers have been lowering prices to compete
for declining amounts of business as job cuts and plant closings
leave corporate customers in need of less coverage. Demand for
insurance didn’t increase in the second quarter, according to 74
percent of brokers surveyed by CIAB.
