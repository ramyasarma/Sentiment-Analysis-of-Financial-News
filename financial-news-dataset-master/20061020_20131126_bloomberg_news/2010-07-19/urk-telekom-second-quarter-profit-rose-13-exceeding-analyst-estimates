             Turk Telekomunikasyon AS , Turkey’s
biggest telecommunications company, said second-quarter profit
rose 13 percent, beating analyst estimates, helped by new
tariffs and rising mobile and broadband sales.  
 Net income advanced to 601 million liras ($390.4 million)
from 529.9 million liras a year earlier, Turk Telekom said today
in a filing with the Istanbul Stock Exchange. That beat the
average estimate of 541.9 million liras in a Bloomberg survey of
12 analysts. Sales rose 0.9 percent to 2.67 billion liras.  
 Turk Telekom, owned 55 percent by Dubai-based Oger Telecom
Ltd., has almost no competitors in the shrinking landline
business and controls nearly 95 percent of the broadband market
via its TTNet AS unit. Its mobile unit, Avea Iletisim Hizmetleri
AS, competes with  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS , Turkey’s
biggest mobile company, and  Vodafone Group Plc , the No. 2.  
 “More than 4 million homes now use our Ev Avantaj
tariff,” which offers free calls from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and
cheaper calls to mobile operators, Chief Executive Officer  Paul Doany  said in the statement.  
 Turk Telekom shares  rose 5 kurus, or 1 percent, to 5.2
liras at 3:03 p.m. on the Istanbul stock exchange.  
 Profit was helped by a doubling of Avea’s margin to 11
percent in the quarter for earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, Doany said.  
 Subscribers at TTNet increased to 6.48 million from 6.37
million in the previous quarter. Its sales climbed 17 percent
from a year earlier to 616.5 million liras.  
 Avea’s subscribers dropped to 11.47 million in the second
quarter from 11.65 million in the first. Its revenue advanced
2.9 percent from a year earlier to 642.7 million liras.  
 Landline users declined to 16.3 million from 16.4 million
in the previous period.  
 Total debt was 4.6 billion liras at the end of June, when
the company also had 811 million liras of cash.
