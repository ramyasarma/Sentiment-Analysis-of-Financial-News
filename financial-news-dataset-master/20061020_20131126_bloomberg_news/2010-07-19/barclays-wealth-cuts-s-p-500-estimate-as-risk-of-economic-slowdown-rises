             Barclays Wealth, which manages $231
billion in client assets, reduced its estimate for this year’s
gain in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  because the chance of a
slowdown in economic growth has increased.  
 The U.S. equity benchmark will end this year at about
1,110, up 4.2 percent from its close on July 16, according to
 Michael Dicks , London-based head of research, economics and
strategy at Barclays Wealth. That’s 9.8 percent lower than the
1,230 level that the asset manager forecast in April.  
 Concern about the economic recovery and a sovereign-debt
crisis in Europe helped push the  S&P 500  4.5 percent lower this
year. Continued risks to growth in either the U.S. or China may
push stocks lower, Dicks said.  Confidence  among U.S. consumers
tumbled in July to the lowest level in a year, while China’s
gross domestic product rose a less-than-forecast 10.3 percent in
the second quarter, down from 11.9 percent in January to March.  
 “The probability of something really horrible happening
has risen,” Dicks said in a press briefing in London today.
“With growth in both the U.S. and Asia set to slow in the
second half of the year, fears may rise. Expectations could
remain polarized between either a stock market boom or a
deflationary bust.”  
 Still Cheap  
 Barclays Wealth’s forecast for the S&P 500 is below the
mean estimate of 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News on
July 12, who anticipated that the benchmark will reach 1,242 at
the end of the year, a 17 percent rally from its July 16 close.  
 If economic growth does not “fall apart,” the S&P 500 may
still climb from 15 to 20 percent as price-to-earnings multiples
suggest “they are still cheap,” he said. The S&P 500 has
dropped 13 percent from its high this year on April 23, driving
its valuation to about 15 times the reported earnings of its
companies, near the lowest level since June 2009, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 The asset manager also lowered its estimate for the U.K.’s
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  to 5,300, a 9.2 percent decline from
the 5,840 it had anticipated in April, and trimmed its Euro
Stoxx 50 Index forecast to 2,820 by year-end, which is 8.1
percent below the 3,070 it had estimated in April.  
 As European governments slash their budget deficits, gross
domestic product in the 16-nation euro region may fall and
monetary union may “break up entirely,” adding to uncertainty
in equity markets, according to Dicks.
