             BP Plc can keep its oil well in the
Gulf of Mexico shut for another 24 hours after agreeing to
monitor a leak through the seafloor and take other precautions,
National Incident Commander  Thad Allen  said.  
 In addition to the seep detected last night, there’s
evidence of methane, or natural gas, over the well, Allen said
in a  statement  today. He’d ordered London-based BP last night to
submit a written procedure to reopen the well if a leak is
confirmed.  
 BP shut valves atop the well on July 15 for a pressure test
initially scheduled to last 48 hours. The test is to determine
the integrity of the well, which caused an April 20 explosion
aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, resulting in the
deaths of 11 workers and spurring the biggest oil spill in U.S.
history.  
 The company can keep testing the well “if they continue to
meet their obligations to rigorously monitor for any signs that
this test could worsen the overall situation,” Allen said.  
 The company continues to drill a relief well aimed at
plugging the damaged well with cement. If the well does need to
be reopened, oil and gas would be piped to ships on the surface,
Allen said.  
 “At any moment, we have the ability to return to the safe
containment of the oil on the surface until the time the relief
well is completed and the well permanently killed,” Allen said.  
 Discovery of the seep came hours after BP’s  Doug Suttles ,
chief operating offer for exploration and production, said
yesterday BP planned to keep the well sealed until it could be
permanently plugged by the relief well.  
 Shares Drop  
 BP  fell  9.35 pence, about 2.3 percent, to 397.8 pence at
12:29 p.m. in London trading. It has lost 39 percent of its
value since the incident on the drilling rig.  
 The company said today it stands ready to resume burning
about 8,000 barrels of oil a day aboard the Q4000 vessel, and to
collect as much as 25,000 barrels a day aboard the production
ship Helix Producer I. The company is continuing work to connect
two other vessels that would bring total surface collection
capacity to as much as 80,000 barrels a day.
