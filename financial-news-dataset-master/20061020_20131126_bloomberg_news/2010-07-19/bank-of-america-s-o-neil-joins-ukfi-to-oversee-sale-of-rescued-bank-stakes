             U.K. Financial Investment Ltd.,
which oversees the government’s stakes in bailed-out lenders,
hired  Jim O’Neil  from Bank of America Corp. to become head of
markets investments.  
 O’Neil, head of international corporate finance and
restructuring at Bank of America, will be in charge of deciding
how the U.K. government will sell its stakes in  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc , London-based
UKFI said in a statement today.  
 “I consider Jim’s appointment to be a real coup for UKFI
and for the taxpayer as shareholder in Lloyds and RBS,” UKFI
Chief Executive Officer  Robin Budenberg  said in the statement.
“Jim has a rare combination of skills in both equity and debt
capital markets and in the banking sector.”  
 The U.K. government set up UKFI last year after it took
majority stakes in RBS and Lloyds. Tim Sykes, the former head of
market-investment strategy at UKFI, said he was leaving in May,
shortly after the coalition government took office.
