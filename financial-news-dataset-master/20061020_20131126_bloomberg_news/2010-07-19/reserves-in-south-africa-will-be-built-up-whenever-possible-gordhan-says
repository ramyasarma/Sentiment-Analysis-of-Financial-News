             South Africa’s central bank will be
enabled to build up its foreign exchange reserves “to the
extent that it’s possible and affordable,” Finance Minister
Pravin Gordhan told reporters in Pretoria today.  
 “We want a very competitive and stable exchange rate,” he
said. “The Reserve Bank now has a more flexible mandate and is
required to take into account employment, asset bubbles and
economic growth when it sets interest rates.”
