             Climex, the Dutch emissions-trading
system, won a tender to hold two auctions of European Union
carbon-dioxide allowances for the Netherlands this year at an
unspecified time.  
 Climex and its clearing house, APX BV-Endex, were appointed
by the Dutch ministries of environment and economic affairs to
sell 4 million metric tons of allowances in two auctions,
Utrecht, Netherlands-based Climex said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 The rules of the auctions probably will be similar to those
for sales in the EU program’s third phase, which begins in 2013,
said Sascha Bloemhoff, director of  Climex .  
 “It’s an excellent opportunity to practice,” she said
today by telephone.
