             Emirates announced an order for 30
Boeing Co. 777-300ER aircraft valued at $9.1 billion, as the
largest Arab airline expands its fleet of long-range jets.  
 The airline disclosed the order today during the
Farnborough Air Show in the U.K. Of the 30 planes, 18 had
already been ordered and were listed in Boeing’s backlog as
coming from an undisclosed customer.  
 Today’s announcement adds to the 71 777-300ERs Emirates
previously ordered, of which 53 aircraft are now in service, the
airline said. The accord with Chicago-based  Boeing  follows a
deal last month to acquire 32 additional A380 superjumbos from
Airbus SAS.  
 The order “affirms Emirates’ strategy to become a world
leading carrier and to further establish Dubai as a central
gateway to worldwide air travel,” Emirates Chairman  Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum  said in an e-mailed  statement . “Our latest
deal signals Emirates’ confidence in the growth of the thriving
aviation sector.”  
 Middle Eastern carriers including Emirates and Qatar
Airways Ltd. have become among the biggest buyers of commercial
aircraft as they seek to use their geographical advantage to
build global networks. Emirates can reach 95 percent of the
world’s population from Dubai on an A380, according to Airbus.  
 Emirates is the largest operator of Boeing 777s, which
typically seat between 300 and 400 passengers, making it the
manufacturer’s second-largest model behind the 747 jumbo-jet.  
 Airbus Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said July 17 that
he aims during the air show to double the 131 orders received so
far this year. Airbus has already announced orders for
122 planes in the first day at the air show.  
 Boeing’s commercial-plane chief,  Jim Albaugh , predicted
“quite a number” of orders at the show this week.
