             France’s CAC 40 Index fell 13.83
points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,486.33 at the 5:30 p.m. close in
Paris, extending the 2.3 percent on July 16. The SBF 120 Index
also fell 0.4 percent.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in French
equity-market trading today.  
 Aeroports de Paris  (ADP FP): The operator of the French
capital’s Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports slipped 1.3
percent to 52.9 euros, a fourth straight decline. The company
reported a 2.3 percent increase in traffic for the month of June
compared with a year earlier.  
      European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co.  (EAD FP), the
parent company of Airbus SAS, gained 0.8 percent to 16.56 euros,
snapping three days of losses. Airbus and Boeing Co. are poised
to win orders this week from plane-leasing companies returning
to the market after the economic crisis, said four people
familiar with the planned announcements.  
 Groupe Eurotunnel SA  (GET FP), operator of the undersea
rail link between England and France, slipped 2.9 percent to
5.76 euros, a fourth straight decline. The company said its
first-half loss widened on higher financing costs and delayed
insurance payouts linked to a 2008 tunnel fire.  
 GDF Suez SA  (GSZ FP) rose 0.7 percent to 24.5 euros, its
first gain in four days. The operator of Europe’s largest
natural-gas network is in preliminary talks to combine some of
its assets with  International Power Plc , creating an enlarged
London-traded company majority-owned by GDF. The combination
would include GDF international units outside Europe, as well as
some assets in the U.K. and Turkey, London-based International
Power said today.  
      Stallergenes SA  (GENP FP) fell 2.1 percent to 55.62 euros,
paring some of its 3.3 percent rally on July 16. Europe’s
second-largest maker of allergy medicines could raise as much as
100 million euros ($130 million) in a stock sale to help finance
acquisitions if takeover opportunities arise, Investir reported
July 17, citing Chief Executive Officer  Albert Saporta .
