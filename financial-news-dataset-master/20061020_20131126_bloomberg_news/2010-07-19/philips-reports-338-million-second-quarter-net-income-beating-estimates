             Royal Philips Electronics NV , the
world’s biggest lighting company, posted a higher second-quarter
profit, beating analysts’ estimates, helped by cost cuts and
reduced losses in the television business.  
 Second-quarter net income attributable to shareholders rose
to 259 million euros ($334 million) from 44 million euros a year
earlier, the Amsterdam-based company said in a statement today.
Analysts had predicted profit of 252.5 million euros, the mean
of 14  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Philips, whose health-care and lighting units compete with
 General Electric Co.  and  Siemens AG , last year set out to slash
6,000 jobs to bolster profitability. The company predicts that
its fixed-cost base will be more than 700 million euros lower in
2010 than in 2008. Philips posted a second quarter of year-on-
year sales growth as customers resumed spending after the global
economic slowdown.  
 “You still see a strong profit recovery, the margins
continue to improve,” said  Peter Olofsen , an Amsterdam-based
analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in a phone interview.
“They’ve become slightly more positive for the full-year
outlook, but this is something the market already took into
account.”  
 Sales rose to 6.19 billion euros from 5.23 billion euros,
in line with the 6.17 billion-euro average estimate of 20
analysts.  
 Confidence  
 “Assuming that the current economic climate will continue,
we are confident that we can exceed” adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes and amortization as a percentage of sales of 10
percent in 2010.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Gerard Kleisterlee , who will be
replaced as CEO by  Frans van Houten  next year, last month  told 
investors the company was “increasingly confident” of reaching
adjusted Ebita at 10 percent of sales as early as 2010.  
 Philips dropped 2.4 percent to 24.30 euros in Amsterdam
trading as of 9:02 a.m. Before today, the  shares  had climbed 20
percent this year while the Amsterdam Exchanges Index fell 3.4
percent.  
 Earnings  before interest, taxes and amortization rose to
527 million euros, from 118 million euros a year earlier. Ebita
as a percentage of sales was 8.5 percent.
