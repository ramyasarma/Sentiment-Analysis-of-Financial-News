             Indian stocks rose to the highest in
2 1/2 years after the nation’s merchandise exports increased for
the fifth straight month and on optimism earnings growth will
exceed analyst forecasts.  
 Larsen & Toubro Ltd., the nation’s biggest engineering
company, gained for the first time in a week. Sterlite
Industries (India) Ltd., the largest copper producer, advanced
0.7 percent. Sesa Goa Ltd. increased the most in two weeks.
Overseas  shipments , which account for a fifth of the $1.2
trillion economy, advanced 30.4 percent to $17.75 billion from a
year earlier last month, the government said yesterday.  
 “There’s a strong feel-good factor in the economy,”  Rahul Chadha , head of India equities at Mirae Asset Global Investment,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “Demand momentum for
technology companies has been pretty strong and we’ve seen a
pretty good set of results from financials.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
rose 92.55, or 0.5 percent, to 18,020.97 as of 9:24 a.m. in
Mumbai, poised for its highest close since February 2008. The
S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange advanced 0.4
percent to 5,408.10. The  BSE 200 Index  climbed 0.5 percent to
2,296.88.  
 Larsen, which last year got 29 percent of sales abroad,
gained 0.7 percent to 165 rupees. Sterlite increased 0.7 percent
to 164.9 rupees, its first advance in five trading sessions.  
 Earnings Growth  
 Exports  were driven by engineering goods, iron ore, gems,
jewelry and chemicals, according to Commerce Secretary Rahul
Khullar. Overseas sales of engineering goods were worth $5
billion in June, almost double the previous month, he told
reporters yesterday.  Imports  rose 23 percent to $28.3 billion
last month, widening the trade deficit to $10.55 billion.  
 Indian companies  may increase earnings by as much as 25
percent this year, with first-quarter results suggesting that
profit growth is “on track,” Mirae Asset said. That’s more
optimistic than the 6.3 percent earnings growth expected for
companies on the Sensex, according to analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 Sesa Goa , India’s biggest iron-ore exporter, climbed 1.7
percent to 354.2 rupees after it said  first-quarter  profit rose
three-fold from a year earlier on higher prices of the
steelmaking raw material. Group net income increased to 13
billion rupees ($276 million) in the three months ended June 30
from 4.2 billion rupees a year earlier, the Panaji, Goa-based
company said in a statement posted on its website.
