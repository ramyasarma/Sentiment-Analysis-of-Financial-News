             Amtrak said there were delays
between New York and Boston because severe thunderstorms  downed
trees, some of which became entangled in the overhead catenary
wire and  across two tracks. That resulted in the temporary loss
of electrical and signal power in sections of Connecticut and
Rhode Island.  
 The information was disclosed in an e-mailed statement.
