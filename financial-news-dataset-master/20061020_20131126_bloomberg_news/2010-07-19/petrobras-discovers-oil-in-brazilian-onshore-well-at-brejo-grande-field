             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, found evidence of oil in an
onshore well in Brazil’s Brejo Grande field, the Brazilian
petroleum regulator said.  
 The discovery was made at the 3BRSA849DPSE well in the
Sergipe basin, the National Petroleum Agency said on its
website. The company hasn’t determined if the find can be
developed commercially.
