             Most Indian stocks fell after the
government’s top statistician said inflation is accelerating,
increasing pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates
next week.  
 DLF Ltd. , the nation’s biggest real estate developer,
declined 1.3 percent. The pace of price increases will quicken
in July because of higher fuel costs, T.C.A. Anant, said.
 Reliance Communications Ltd.  rose 2 percent after the Financial
Times said Emirates Telecommunications Corp. may buy a stake.  
 “If India can’t manage the inflation, then definitely its
charm may be subdued to some extent for foreign investors,”
said  Jagannadham Thunuguntla , chief strategist at SMC Capital
Ltd. in New Delhi. “We may be getting into a slightly moderated
and normalized earnings growth pattern,”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
lost 26.36, or 0.2 percent, to 17,929.46, according to
preliminary closing prices. Nineteen stocks fell and 11 rose.
The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange dropped
0.1 percent to 5,386.35. The  BSE 200 Index  was little changed at
2,286.56.
