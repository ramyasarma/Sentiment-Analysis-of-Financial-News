             Iran’s new domestically built
submarines are to be unveiled in August, Defense Minister  Ahmad Vahidi  said, according to  Press TV .  
 Iran announced in 2008 that it had started building
submarines to give its military “the most advanced arms” and
maintain “security” in the Strait of Hormuz.  
 The Defense Ministry inaugurated the production line for
the Qaem submarines two years ago, saying the vessels would have
the capacity to launch torpedoes and subsurface missiles.  
 Iranian authorities have hailed recent military advances as
proof that it remains technologically self-sufficient even under
four sets of United Nations sanctions over the country’s refusal
to scale back its nuclear program.  
 The U.S. and Israel, a state that the Iranian establishment
doesn’t recognize, haven’t ruled out military strikes to curb
Iran’s nuclear development. Iran rejects claims by the U.S. and
many of its allies that the program may be aimed at building
weapons, and says the technology is needed for civilian
purposes.
