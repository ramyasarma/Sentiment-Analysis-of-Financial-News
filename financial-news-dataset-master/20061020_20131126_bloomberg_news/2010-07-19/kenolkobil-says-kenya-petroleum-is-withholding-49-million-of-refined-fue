             KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in seven African nations, said Kenya
Petroleum Refineries Ltd. is holding more than 4 billion
shillings ($49 million) of refined fuel belonging to the
retailer.  
 KenolKobil is also accusing the refinery of locking out two
ships holding a total of 45,000 metric tons of refined petroleum
and jet fuel,  David Ohana , the general manager of KenolKobil’s
Kenyan unit, told reporters in the capital, Nairobi, today.  
 KenolKobil, which has 25 percent market share in the East
African nation, has incurred more than 240 million shillings in
demurrage costs, a term used when the charterer pays the
shipowner for extra use of the vessel. One ship has been at sea
for more than two months, while the other has been out for about
a month, Ohana said.  
 “Yes we have their products,” John Mruttu, general
manager of the refinery, said in a telephone interview from the
port city of Mombasa. “We deal with crude-oil processing and
therefore cannot comment on allocation of space to download”.  
 Mruttu declined to give reasons why the refinery is holding
KenolKobil stock or provide the value of the refined petroleum .  
 KenolKobil said July 15 that a decision by Kenya Petroleum
Refineries to stop processing crude oil on its behalf is not
valid and that no ruling was made to terminate the contract.  
 KenolKobil served notice to Kenya Petroleum that an
arbitrator has been appointed to help resolve a dispute over the
validity of their crude processing agreement, KenolKobil
Chairman  Jacob Segman  said on July 15. The claim for 4.98
billion shillings includes loss of business, the statement said.  
 Kenya Petroleum is jointly owned by the country’s
government and Essar Energy Overseas Ltd.
