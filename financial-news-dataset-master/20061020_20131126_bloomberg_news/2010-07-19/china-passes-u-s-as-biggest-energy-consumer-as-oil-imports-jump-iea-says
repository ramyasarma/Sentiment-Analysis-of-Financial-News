             China overtook the U.S. as the
world’s biggest energy user last year, emphasizing that
developing nations are driving global growth, according to the
International Energy Agency.  
 China consumed 2,252 million metric tons of oil equivalent
in 2009 in the form of crude, coal, natural gas, nuclear power
and renewable sources, IEA Chief Economist  Fatih Birol  said
yesterday. That exceeded the 2,170 million tons used by the U.S.  
 “It’s one of those major turning points,”  Tilak Doshi ,
the chief economist at the Energy Studies Institute at the
National University of Singapore, said in a phone interview.
“China is growing by leaps and bounds. You’ve got OECD
countries where you’re talking about oil demand peaking,
meanwhile the emerging countries like China and India will keep
growing their energy demand.”  
 China’s gross domestic product expanded 10.3 percent in the
second quarter even as the government took measures to cool
growth. China, with Hong Kong included, was the biggest energy
user in 2009, consuming 2.2 billion tons of oil equivalent,  BP
Plc  said in its annual Statistical Review of World Energy in
June. The U.S. was second and Russia ranked third, BP said.  
 “As China overtakes the U.S. as the world’s largest energy
consumer, it is not only a domestic issue for China, but has
repercussions for the rest of the world not only in supply terms,
but also in how the energy is consumed,” Birol said in an
interview by phone from Paris. “If China uses electric cars,
hybrids and so on, they will impose the manufacturing line on
most of the rest of the world.”  
 China Skeptical  
 The IEA’s data are “not very credible,” Zhou Xi’an, head
of the National Energy Administration’s general office, said at
a media briefing in Beijing today.  
 “When the IEA came to China to publish its energy outlook
a couple of days ago, they also over-estimated China’s energy
consumption and carbon dioxide emissions,” Zhou said. “We
think that’s because of a lack of knowledge about China,
especially about China’s latest developments of energy
conservation and renewable energy.”  
 At the same time China increases its use of fossil fuels,
it is boosting renewable energy projects. The nation may spend
about 5 trillion yuan ($738 billion) in the next decade
developing cleaner sources of energy to reduce emissions from
burning oil and coal, Jiang Bing, head of the National Energy
Administration’s planning and development department, said in
Beijing today.  
 China’s  oil imports  gained 48 percent last year and have
almost doubled since 2005, according to customs data. The nation
increased net crude imports to a record 22.1 million tons in
June, or about 5.4 million barrels a day, customs figures show.  
 Declining Output  
 Global oil supplies will become “tighter” after 2015 as a
result of declining production outside the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, and growing control of reserves
by state-run producers, Birol said.  
 The U.S. remains the largest oil consumer, using 843
million tons in 2009, more than double China’s 405 million,
according to BP. China burnt 1,537 million tons of coal last
year, compared with 498 million in the U.S., BP said.  
 The reliance on coal saw China  surpass  the U.S. in carbon
emissions in 2007, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
China released 6.533 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2008,
compared with 5.832 million for the U.S.  
 “When we look at the countries who are engines of global
energy-demand growth, namely China, China, China, India and
Middle East, then I am a bit more optimistic,” Birol said.  
 The IEA’s 2010 World Energy Outlook on supply and demand
through to 2035, to be released in November, will focus on three
particular topics, he said.  
 These will be the cost of renewable energy sources; costs
faced by the energy industry following the failure to reach an
accord in Copenhagen; and the diversion of oil supplies in the
Caspian Sea region from Europe to Asia.  
 The IEA is an adviser to 28 developed nations, all of whom
are also members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development.
