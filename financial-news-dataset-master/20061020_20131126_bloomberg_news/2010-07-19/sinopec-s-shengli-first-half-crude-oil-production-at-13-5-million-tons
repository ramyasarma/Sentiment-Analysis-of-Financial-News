             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ,
the nation’s second-largest oil producer, said crude output at
its largest field reached 13.54 million metric tons in the first
half, without giving year earlier figures.  
 Daily production at Shengli field in Shandong province
dropped to more than 1,400 tons below the planned volume at the
beginning of this year because of cold weather, according to a
 statement  on the state-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission website today. It didn’t elaborate.  
 PetroChina Co.’s Daqing field, the nation’s largest, is
headed to meet its annual output of 40 million tons, parent
China National Petroleum Corp. said on July 7. Daqing in
Heilongjiang produced 1.6 billion cubic meters of gas and 20.06
million tons of crude oil in the first half, it said then.
