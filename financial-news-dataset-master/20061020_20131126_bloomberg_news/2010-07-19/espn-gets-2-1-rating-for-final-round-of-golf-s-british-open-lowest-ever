             Walt Disney Co.’s  ESPN earned a
preliminary television rating of 2.1 for the final round of the
British Open yesterday, the lowest for a final round in the
event’s history.  
 ESPN averaged a 1.4 rating, or about 1.86 million U.S.
households, through the first three rounds and was set to be the
highest rating since 2006. Then South Africa’s Louis Oosthuizen
pulled ahead, winning by seven strokes over world No. 3-ranked
 Lee Westwood .  
 “Oosthuizen dominated and the lack of drama had a
significant impact on the ratings,” spokesman  Mark Mandel  said
in an interview.  
 The final round rating of 2.1 represents about 2.97 million
U.S. households, Mandel said. Last year’s final round received a
3.8 rating, or about 5.55 million U.S. households, for  Tom Watson ’s playoff loss to  Stewart Cink .  
 In prior years, the tournament was seen on the ABC network,
like ESPN a unit of Disney.
