             Sesa Goa Ltd. , India’s biggest iron-
ore exporter, said  first-quarter  profit rose three-fold from a
year earlier on higher prices of the steelmaking raw material.  
 Group net income rose to 13 billion rupees ($276 million)
in the three months ended June 30 from 4.2 billion rupees a year
earlier, the Panaji, Goa-based company said in a statement
posted on its website. Net sales rose to 24.1 billion rupees
from 10.1 billion rupees.  
 Average cash prices  of 62 percent iron-content ore
delivered to Tianjin port in China more than doubled to $159 a
metric ton in the three months ended June 30, compared with $69
a ton a year ago, according to the Steel Index. The spot price
rose to a record $186.5 a ton on April 21.  
 Prices for immediate delivery surged in April after Vale SA,
the world’s largest iron ore producer, and  BHP Billiton Ltd. 
ended a 40-year system of setting annual prices by signing
short-term contracts with Asian steelmakers, with the Brazilian
company winning a 90 percent increase.  
 Sesa Goa , a unit of  Vedanta Resources Plc , exports most of
its production to steelmakers in China and Japan.  
 The  shares  rose 1.5 percent to 348.35 rupees at the close
of trading today in Mumbai. The benchmark Sensitive Index of the
Bombay Stock Exchange fell 0.2 percent.
