             A Greek journalist shot dead by
unknown gunmen outside his Athens apartment today may have been
targeted by a domestic terrorist group, police said.  
 Socrates Giolias, 37, was gunned down outside his home in
the southern Athens neighborhood of Ilioupoli at 5:26 a.m., a
spokeswoman for the  Hellenic Police  said by telephone today.
Police said later in a text message that tests showed the shell
casings matched two 9-millimeter handguns used by Greek terror
group Revolutionary Sect.  
 “The government categorically condemns this cold-blooded
and cowardly murder,” government spokesman  George Petalotis 
said. “Democracy and freedom of speech can’t be gagged.”  
 Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, which was
carried out by more than one assailant, according to a police
 statement on their website . Police discovered a burnt-out stolen
car, suspected of being used in the attack, a short distance
from the scene.  
 The Revolutionary Sect claimed responsibility last year for
gunning down an anti-terrorism policeman. Officer Nektarios
Savvas was shot dead on June 17 while guarding a person in a
witness-protection program. Savvas was the first fatality in a
series of attacks following the Dec. 6, 2008, shooting of a
teenager in Athens by a police officer.  
 No member of the group has been arrested.
