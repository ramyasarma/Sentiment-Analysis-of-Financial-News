             Amazon.com Inc., the largest
Internet retailer, said growth in sales of its Kindle digital
reader accelerated every month in the second quarter and that
it’s selling more electronic books than hardcover editions.  
 The pace of Kindle sales also has tripled since the company
cut the price to $189 from $259, Amazon.com Chief Executive
Officer  Jeff Bezos  said in a statement.  
 Announced last month, the 27 percent price cut was aimed at
helping Amazon.com fend off a threat from Apple Inc.’s iPad,
which includes book reading tools. Amazon.com hasn’t disclosed
 Kindle  sales since releasing the device in 2007, saying only
that it has sold millions. Its release of growth figures may be
aimed at quelling concern that the iPad has crimped Kindle
demand, said  Dmitriy Molchanov , an analyst at Yankee Group.  
 “There’s a real perception that the iPad has completely
squashed the e-reader space and that’s really not the case,”
said Molchanov, who’s based in Boston. “Amazon is doing really
well and both companies can profit at the same time.”  
 Amazon.com sold more than triple the number of Kindle books
in the first half of the year as it did in the same period last
year, Seattle-based  Amazon.com  said. More than 81 percent of its
630,000 electronic books are $9.99 or less.  
 “We’ve reached a tipping point with the new price of
Kindle,” Bezos said in the statement. “Amazon.com customers
now purchase more Kindle books than hardcover books --
astonishing when you consider that we’ve been selling hardcover
books for 15 years, and Kindle books for 33 months.”  
 Amazon.com rose $1.45 to $119.94 today in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading, trimming the year-to-date  decline  to 11 percent.  
 Kindle Sales  
 Apple said last month that it sold 3 million iPads in 80
days after the device’s April 3 release date. Amazon.com will
probably sell 3.7 million Kindles this year, bringing in $2.38
billion in sales, according to estimates by Caris & Co. The
figure assumes Kindle owners also purchase digital books.  
 In the past three months, Amazon.com has sold 143 Kindle
books for every 100 hardcover books, the company said. In July,
sales of e-books accelerated to 180 sold for every 100 hardcover
versions. Kindle book sales this year have also exceeded broader
e-book sales growth, pegged by the  Association of American
Publishers  at 207 percent through May, Amazon.com said.  
 To fend off competition from Apple and Sony Corp., which
also makes e-readers, this month Amazon.com released a version
of its larger Kindle DX with sharper contrast and cut its price
by more than $100. It plans to introduce an updated version of
its smaller Kindle next month with a sharper screen as well,
people familiar with the matter said in May.
