             Italian banks restricted lending in
the second quarter by making it harder for retail, tourism and
service businesses to get loans, according to  Confcommercio .  
 Some 16.5 percent of companies obtained a smaller loan than
requested during the three months through June and 7.8 percent
were denied any credit, according to a study released today by
the Rome-based retailers’ lobby. The combined figure of 24.3
percent was higher than the 23.4 percent recorded in the first
quarter, Confcommercio said.  
 “In the second quarter, lending restrictions hit a number
of businesses similar to the fourth quarter of 2008, when the
financial crisis started,” it said. “Companies report a worse
situation in terms of banking costs and loan conditions.”  
 Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi  said in a July 15
speech at the  Italian Banking Association ’s annual meeting that
“demand for credit is increasing” even though it’s not being
“fully satisfied.” He urged banks to step up loans as demand
is “showing signs of recovery,” with overall lending rising
2.1 percent in the three months ending in May compared with the
previous three months.  
 Confcommercio polled about 1,500 companies between June 24
and July 6.
