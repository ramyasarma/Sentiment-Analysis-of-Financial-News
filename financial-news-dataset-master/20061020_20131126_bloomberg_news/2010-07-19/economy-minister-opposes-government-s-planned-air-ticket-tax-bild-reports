             German Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle  has distanced himself from the proposed tax on air
tickets, Bild reported, citing a ministerial document it had
reviewed.  
 The ministry estimates that the tax could cause a 4.5
million decline in passenger numbers to 6 million, endangering
10,000 jobs, and the loss in revenue could top 2 billion euros,
the newspaper said.
