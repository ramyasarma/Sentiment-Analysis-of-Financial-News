             Peru’s sol was little changed after
the central bank bought dollars and raised reserve requirements,
offsetting rising demand for the local currency.  
 The sol was little changed at 2.8245 per U.S. dollar at
3:30 p.m. New York time, from 2.8240 on July 16.  
 The central bank bought $120 million in the foreign
exchange market today at an average of 2.8233 soles per dollar,
the bank said on its website, taking its purchases this month to
$1.37 billion. The bank’s purchases are designed to offset
demand for the sol fuelled by the low cost of money in the
international market, Peru’s economic growth and expected
increases in the reference rate, said Scotiabank Peru economist
 Mario Guerrero .  
 “The central bank has adopted a packet of measures to
temper the sol’s appreciation,” Guerrero said. “It increased
the reserve mandate as it’s concerned about dollar offers from
abroad as well as domestic credit and liquidity levels,”
Guerrero said.  
 Policy makers announced higher reserve mandates for the
second time in a month, hiking the requirement on foreign-
currency deposits to 45 percent, compared with 35 percent now.
Banks will also be required to hold funds equivalent to 50
percent of borrowings abroad maturing in less than two years, up
from 40 percent.  
 The central bank has bought $4.6 billion this year, helping
to swell foreign currency reserves to a record $37 billion as of
July 13, equivalent to 28 percent of gross domestic product, and
more than the country’s total public and private foreign debt,
according to the bank.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.58 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s
local unit.
