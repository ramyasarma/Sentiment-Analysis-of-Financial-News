             New Zealand’s government has backed
down from a plan to open parts of its conservation estate,
including national parks, for mining.  
 The government won’t remove any land from schedule four of
the Crown Minerals Act, which is a list of areas covering about
13 percent of the nation where exploration is prohibited, Energy
and Resource Minister Gerry Brownlee announced in Wellington
today.
