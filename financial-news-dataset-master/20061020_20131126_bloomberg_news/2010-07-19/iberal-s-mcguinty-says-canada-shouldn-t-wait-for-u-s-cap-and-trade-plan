             Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s decision to wait for and match a U.S. cap-and-trade
system for greenhouse gas emissions means the country may adopt
controls that don’t reflect Canada’s situation, opposition
lawmaker  David McGuinty  said.  
 Environment Minister  Jim Prentice  in February said Canada
will adopt a cap-and-trade regime for greenhouse gas emissions
if the U.S. does. Emissions per capita in Canada are four times
the world average, according to Bloomberg data, because of the
country’s large land mass, cold winters and energy-consuming
industries, such as mining and forestry.  
 “As we wait for the United States to develop a climate-
change plan, a plan of action which involves pricing carbon
emissions, what we’re really doing is we’re making ourselves
vulnerable to an American response,” McGuinty, the opposition
Liberal Party’s environment critic, said in an interview Friday
at Bloomberg’s Ottawa bureau.  
 U.S. cap-and-trade legislation, in which power plants,
factories and refineries would buy and sell a declining number
of carbon dioxide allowances, narrowly passed the House last
year and stalled in the Senate. The House cap-and-trade plan
would regulate sources responsible for roughly 85 percent of
U.S. greenhouse gases.  
 “It’s important to work in cooperation -- to a certain
extent in lockstep with the United States -- but not abandoning
our sovereignty,” McGuinty, 50, said.
