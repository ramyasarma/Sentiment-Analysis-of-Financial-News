             The euro will fall against all
currencies on anticipation of the “lose-lose situation”
created by bank stress tests due this week, according to  Carl Weinberg , chief economist at High Frequency Economics.  
 “If any banks fail, the market reaction will be bloody,”
Weinberg, who is based in Valhalla, New York, wrote in a
research note late yesterday. “If no banks fail, the market
will sour because no one will believe the results. We think the
week will end with a renewed sense of imminent banking sector-
crisis” in the euro region, he wrote.  
 Euro-area bond yield curves will also experience “rock and
roll” reactions to the stress tests, wrote Weinberg. “Safe
yield curves will flatten, and riskier ones will steepen.”  
 European regulators’ stress tests, which examine the
strength of 91 banks to determine if they can survive potential
losses on sovereign-bond holdings, are due to be published on
July 23.
