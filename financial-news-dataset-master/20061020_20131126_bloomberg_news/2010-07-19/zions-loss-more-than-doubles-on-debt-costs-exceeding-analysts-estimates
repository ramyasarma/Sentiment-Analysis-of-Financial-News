             Zions Bancorporation , this year’s
second best-performing stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
reported a loss that widened more than analysts expected.  
 The second quarter’s net loss was $113 million, or 84 cents
a share, compared with $50.7 million, or 21 cents a share, in
the same period last year, the Salt Lake City-based lender said
in a statement today. The average  estimate  of 27 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was a loss of 52 cents a share.  
 The bank, which operates in 10 Western states, has yet to
repay $1.4 billion in government bailout funds after reporting
losses since the fourth quarter of 2008. The stock has climbed
67 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading this year on signs of
improving credit quality. Loan trends in states where the firm
operates may threaten that progress, said  Al Savastano , an
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., in a July 13 note.  
 “We have concerns with the credit trends as it seems like
the Nevada, Colorado and Arizona franchises are improving but
California, Texas and Utah are becoming more stressed,” wrote
Savastano, who cut the cut the stock’s rating to “ neutral .”
“With a weak economic recovery, this could mean that credit
costs will remain elevated longer than previously anticipated.”
