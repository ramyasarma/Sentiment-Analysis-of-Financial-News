             A son of  Osama bin Laden  said about
20 members of his family stranded in Iran are seeking sanctuary
in a third country and that the U.S. may agree to accept them.  
 Omar bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader’s fourth son, said in
an interview with  Al Arabiya  television that Iran is refusing to
allow his relatives to go to Saudi Arabia. Shiite Muslim-
dominated Iran is a regional rival of Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia.
Al-Qaeda, a Sunni group, is hostile to Iran.  
 “The Americans offered to help them out of Iran and even
hinted at the possibility of receiving them in the U.S.,” he
said in the interview, which was aired late yesterday and posted
on the Dubai-based channel’s website. Omar bin Laden said none
of his brothers has been accused of terrorism by the U.S. or any
other country.  
 The elder bin Laden’s relatives held under house arrest in
Iran include five of his children and one of his wives, Al
Arabiya said. The family had been living in Afghanistan and fled
to Iran after the U.S. military began air strikes on the country
following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.  
 A daughter of bin Laden, Iman, 17, was allowed to leave
Iran for Syria earlier this year after taking refuge in the
Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Her brother, Bakr, 16, also left Iran
for the Syrian capital of Damascus in December.
