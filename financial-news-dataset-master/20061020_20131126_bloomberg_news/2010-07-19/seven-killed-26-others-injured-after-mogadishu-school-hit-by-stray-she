             At least seven people died and 26
others, including several children, were wounded after a stray
bomb hit a school during fighting between government forces and
Islamist insurgents, al-Shabaab, officials said.  
 “Our staff have seen seven dead corpses and collected 26
wounded civilians, mainly school children,” Ali Muse Sheikh, a
paramedic for Nationlink and Africa Lifeline Ambulance Services,
said in an interview from the city today.  
 Two of the 10 injured school children are in a coma,
Mo’alim Ali Mohamoud, the Qur’an teacher who runs the school,
said. The shell hit the school as the students were preparing to
leave yesterday, the teacher said.
