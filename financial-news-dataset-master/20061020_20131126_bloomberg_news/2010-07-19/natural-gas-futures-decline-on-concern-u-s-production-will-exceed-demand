             Natural gas futures were little
changed in New York amid signs that supplies of the power-plant
and factory fuel will exceed demand.  
 The number of U.S. drilling rigs rose to the highest level
in almost 17 months last week, Baker Hughes Inc. data show.
 Halliburton Co. , the biggest provider of land-based oil and gas
field services in the U.S., added 1,700 jobs in the second
quarter as gains in onshore drilling spurred an 83 percent jump
in profit.  
 “Halliburton’s business is pretty robust and people are
worried that gas companies are still over producing,” said  Tom Orr , director of research at Weeden & Co., a brokerage
Greenwich, Connecticut. “The jump in the rig count is playing
into the market.”  
 Natural gas for August delivery slid 0.2 cent to $4.517 per
million British thermal units at 9:52 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The futures have fallen 19 percent this
year.  
 U.S. gas drilling rigs  rose 15 to 979 last week , the
highest level since Feb. 20, 2009, according to Baker Hughes
Inc. Horizontal rigs, which are mostly used in drilling for
shale gas, declined  for the first week in 10 , down four to 859.  
 Gas output will average 61.26 billion cubic feet a day this
year, up 2.1 percent from 59.98 billion in 2009, the Energy
Department said on July 7.  
 The government “projects a continuing decline in Gulf of
Mexico production, which is offset by gains in onshore
production,” the department said in its monthly Short Term
Energy Outlook.  
 Hotter Weather  
 Temperatures will be “above average across the eastern
half of the nation” through July 28, according to MDA Federal
Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather, based in Rockville, Maryland.  
 Chicago will have a high of 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33
Celsius) on July 23, 7 degrees above average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. New York is forecast to reach 90.  
 About 22 percent of electricity is generated using natural
gas, Energy Department figures show.  
 Gas stockpiles gained 78 billion cubic feet in the week
ended July 9 to 2.84 trillion, the Energy Department said last
week. A surplus to the five-year average narrowed to 10.7
percent from 11.5 percent the previous week.  
 “We are going to see hotter-than-normal weather and we can
continue to make small inroads against the storage surplus,”
said  Peter Beutel , president of trading adviser Cameron Hanover
in New Canaan, Connecticut.
