             India, the fourth-biggest producer
of natural rubber, may permit purchases of as much as 100,000
metric tons from abroad at a lower duty to reduce shortage, a
tire producers’ group said.  
 Imports may be allowed at a tax of 7.5 percent, compared
with 20 percent now, said Rajiv Budhraja, director general of
the Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association of India. The
government is “thinking about” paring the duty, Trade
Secretary  Rahul Khullar  told reporters in New Delhi today.  
 Natural rubber prices in India reached a record this month
on concern that the low-output season in the largest producing
nations will worsen a deficit. Bridgestone Corp. said in March
it will spend 50 billion yen ($577 million) on a second plant in
India, joining local rivals Apollo Tyres Ltd. and Ceat Ltd. in
adding capacity to benefit from rising automobiles sales.  
 “There is a shortage, which can only be bridged through
imports,” Budharaja said in a phone interview from New Delhi.
“We understand that the government has taken this decision in
response to our demand for duty-free imports.”  
 Apollo Tyres, the nation’s biggest producer, and its local
rivals have increased prices by as much as 10 percent this year
to pass on higher costs, according to the Press Trust of India.
Rubber makes up 42 percent of the raw material costs, according
to the manufacturers’ group.  
 Rising incomes in the world’s third-fastest growing major
economy may more than double annual car sales to 3 million by
2015, according to the government. Natural-rubber imports may
climb 18 percent to 200,000 tons in the year to March 31 as tire
makers expand plants to meet rising demand from automakers,
Budhraja said. Purchases in the quarter ended June were 35,503
tons, according to the state-owned the  Rubber Board .  
 Rubber consumption may increase 5.1 percent to 978,000 tons
this year, according to the board. Demand in the quarter ended
June jumped 5.2 percent to 230,300 tons and production climbed
4.1 percent to 165,900 tons, the board said July 1.
