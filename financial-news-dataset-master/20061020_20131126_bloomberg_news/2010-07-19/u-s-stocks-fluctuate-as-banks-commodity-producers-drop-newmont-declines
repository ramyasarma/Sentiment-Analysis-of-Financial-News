             U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses as declines in financial companies and commodity
producers wiped out an early advance.  
 First Horizon National Corp. lost 3.7 percent to lead
declines in 71 of 80 financial stocks in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index after Keefe, Bruyette & Woods downgraded the shares.
Newmont Mining Corp. sank 3.7 percent to pace declines in mining
companies. Halliburton Co. jumped 3.2 percent after posting
better-than-estimated earnings.  
 The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 1,063.63 at 10:30 a.m.
in New York after climbing as much as 0.7 percent earlier. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.51 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 10,099.42, wiping out most of a 73 point advance.   
 U.S. stocks declined last week, ending the Dow’s longest
winning streak in two months, following worse-than-estimated
sales at Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and General
Electric Co. and a drop in a gauge of consumer confidence to the
lowest level in a year.
