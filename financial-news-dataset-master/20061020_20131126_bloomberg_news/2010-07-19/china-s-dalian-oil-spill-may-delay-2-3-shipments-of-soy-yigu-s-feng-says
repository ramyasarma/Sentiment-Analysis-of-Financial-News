             An oil spill at China’s northeast
port city of Dalian may delay the offloading of two-to-three
cargoes of soybeans, said Feng Lichen, a manager at Yigu
Information Consulting Ltd.  
 The shipments were scheduled to be offloaded at the
Beiliang Port in Dalian, Feng said today by phone, without
saying who owned the cargoes. Authorities are limiting routes
for ships traveling near Dalian as clean-up efforts proceed
over the next four-to-five days, Feng said.  
 An incorrect procedure during the offloading of a tanker
may have led an explosion July 16 that damaged two pipelines
and spilled oil into the Yellow Sea,  PetroChina Co.,  spokesman
Mao Zefeng said. The cause is yet to be confirmed and an
investigation is under way, he said. The oil port was closed
after the blasts, said an official at one of PetroChina’s two
refineries at Dalian, who can’t be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak to the media.  
 “In my view the oil spill and explosion will have little
effect on agricultural markets,” Feng said. “There is no corn
scheduled to be shipped from those ports that have been
impacted and the government now said the cleanup may take four-
to five days.”  
 Dalian-based Yigu is an agricultural consulting company.
