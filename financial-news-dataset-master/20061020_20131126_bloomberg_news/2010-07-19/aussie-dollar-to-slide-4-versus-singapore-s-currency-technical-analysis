             Australia’s dollar is poised to
slide 4 percent against Singapore’s currency after falling below
a moving average today, according to United Overseas Bank Ltd.  
 The Australian currency retreated to 1.1922 versus its
Singapore counterpart, the lowest level since July 7. It
weakened beyond the 50-day moving average of 1.1944, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Australian dollar has closed
above the average on only seven occasions in the past three
months, which suggests further weakness, said  Lee Sue Ann , a
treasury economist at the bank in Singapore.  
 “We are pretty bearish on the Australian-Singapore dollar
cross,” Lee said. “It is possible the cross will target 1.18.
Thereafter, we could see 1.15.”  
 The Australian dollar traded at 1.1976 as of 11:53 a.m. in
Singapore, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Moving averages help
traders determine support and resistance levels. A resistance
level is where sell orders for a currency may be clustered.
