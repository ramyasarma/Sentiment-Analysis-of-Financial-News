             Malaysia’s ringgit may slide 1.5
percent in the coming weeks if it closes weaker than 3.2220 per
dollar today, according to KAF Investment Bank Bhd.  
 The currency is threatening to break out from a trend line
that marks its almost 2 percent climb from May 26 through last
week, according to  Faizal Yussof , a foreign-exchange trader at
the bank. A retreat last week in the JPMorgan-Bloomberg  Asia
Dollar Index  to below its 200-day moving average is also a good
sign for dollar bulls, Faizal said.  
 “The focus today is on the critical 3.2220 level,” he
said in a phone interview from Kuala Lumpur. “The ringgit is
especially vulnerable given the broad weakness in the Asia
Dollar Index and stock-market sentiment.”  
 The currency declined 0.5 percent to 3.2245 per dollar as
of 3:55 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, as the nation’s benchmark stock index fell 0.4
percent. The ringgit may test the 3.2720 level touched on June
30, Faizal said, concurrent to his prediction that the Asia
Dollar Index will drop 0.6 percent to 110.22 in the coming days.  
 The stochastic oscillator also signals the ringgit will
weaken, Faizal said. The chart measures the closing price of a
security relative to its highs and lows during a particular
period to try to predict whether it will rise or fall.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
