             Honda Motor Co. is building a hybrid
car to be recharged at home and an electric car to be released
in about three years, Nikkei English News reported, without
saying where it got the information.  
 Honda may also manufacture hybrids in the U.S., Nikkei
said. President Takanobu Ito plans to announce developments for
plug-in hybrids, electric cars and other alternative vehicles at
a news conference today.
