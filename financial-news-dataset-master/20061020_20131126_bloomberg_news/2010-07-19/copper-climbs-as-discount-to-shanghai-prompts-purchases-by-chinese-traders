             Copper gained for the first time in
three days in Asia after a drop to a two-week low increased its
discount to Shanghai prices, encouraging purchases by Chinese
traders. Zinc and lead also climbed.  
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 1 percent to $6,551 a metric ton, and
traded at $6,523 at 3:46 p.m. in Singapore. October copper on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost as much as 2.3 percent to
51,910 yuan ($7,662) a ton, before ending the day at 52,320
yuan.  
 Futures in London are trading at a discount to Chinese
contracts after declining 4.1 percent last week, compared with
a 1 percent drop in Shanghai. Arbitrage traders profit from
buying the metal in London and selling it in Shanghai to take
advantage of the price disparity.  
 “We continue to see some buying whenever the market dips,
however third quarter prospects aren’t looking good given the
recent numbers,” Yin Songyu, an analyst at Guolian Futures Co.,
said from Jiangsu. “Macroeconomic data has been uneven and
from the recent numbers, global economic growth may slow
further in the coming months.”  
 Earlier, copper in London fell as much as 0.2 percent to
$6,470, the lowest level since July 6, after reports last week
showed U.S. manufacturing contracted in June by the most in a
year and second-quarter growth slowed in China.  
 Reports out of the U.S. this week may show the housing
market slowed in June as construction and purchases declined,
while an index of leading indicators probably dropped for the
first time in more than a year.  
 Copper Supplies  
 “In the short-to-medium term, at least until the end of
the year, uncertainties in the global economy will ensure
prices still have some way to fall,” said Li Yajing, an
analyst at Guangyong Futures Co. “Global supplies have been on
a decline, however they are ample enough to meet the current
demand.”  
 Copper  stockpiles  in LME warehouses fell on July 16 for
the 21st day to 426,425 tons, the lowest level since Nov. 23.
They’re down 15 percent this year and headed for the first
annual drop since 2004.  
 Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, stopped
mining activity at its Norte division because of high winds, a
company official briefed on the matter said in a telephone
interview today.  
 The company continues to process copper concentrate, the
official said. Codelco plans to resume mining at Norte tomorrow,
he said.  
 Aluminum in London gained 0.4 percent to $1,986.50 a ton,
zinc rose 0.9 percent to $1,813.25 a ton and lead added 0.6
percent to $1,780 a ton. Nickel climbed 0.7 percent to $19,075
a ton a ton, and tin increased 1.1 percent to $17,950 a ton by
3:49 p.m. in Singapore.
