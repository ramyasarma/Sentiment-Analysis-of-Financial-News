             Bank of France Governor Christian
Noyer said France must contain its public debt and meet its goal
of reducing the budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic
product by 2013 to sustain consumer confidence. He also said the
financial system should be made less “pro-cyclical” and more
transparent. He made his comments in his annual letter to
President Nicolas Sarkozy today.
