             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros in London climbed above 0.8 percent
for the first time in more than 10 months, data from the British
Bankers’ Association showed.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or  Libor , for such loans
was at 0.808 percent, the most since Aug. 26, 2009, the BBA said
today. The rate was 0.794 percent at the end of last week. The
euro Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend,
narrowed two basis points to 18 basis points at 12:23 p.m. in
London.  
 Three-month dollar  Libor  slipped to 0.518 percent, the BBA
said. The rate was 0.521 percent on July 16.  
 Three-month  Euribor  rose to 0.87 percent, the most since
Aug. 13, 2009, from 0.861 percent on July 16, according to data
from the European Banking Federation.
