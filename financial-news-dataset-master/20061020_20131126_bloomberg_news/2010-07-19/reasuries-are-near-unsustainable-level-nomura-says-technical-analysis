             Treasuries  will likely begin to
decline, snapping a three-month rally, if futures prices fall
below a key technical level, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 “The market may be nearing a bullish extreme,”  Walter Burke , a fixed-income technical strategist in New York at
Nomura, said in a phone interview. The firm is one of the 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “The
momentum has been favorable for Treasuries, but it is close to
excessive.”  
 The price on 10-year futures contracts for September
delivery fell 6/32 today, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to
123. It closed June 16 at 123 6/32, the highest level since
April 2009. Futures are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date.  
 A move below a support level of 122 17/32 on the 10-year
Treasury contract will be the “first domino toppling” in the
Treasury rally and signal a broader drop, Burke said.  
 A support level is an area on a chart where orders may be
clustered. In technical analysis investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
