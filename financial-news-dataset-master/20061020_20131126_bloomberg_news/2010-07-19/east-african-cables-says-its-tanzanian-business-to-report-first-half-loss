             East African Cables Ltd. said its
Tanzanian unit will report a “significant” first-half loss
because of provisions for bad and doubtful debts and inventory.  
 The company’s Kenyan units remains “strong and
profitable,” East African said in a statement distributed by
the Nairobi Stock Exchange today.
