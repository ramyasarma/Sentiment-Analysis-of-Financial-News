             Three Ivory Coast journalists
detained for publishing an article about a report on corruption
in the nation’s cocoa industry were charged with theft of
official documents today, their lawyer said.  
 “We don’t think the charge of stealing official documents
stands, therefore it amounts to the journalists’ being charged
for the content of their articles,” Narcisse Atta said in an
interview in the commercial capital, Abidjan, today. The three
will be sentenced on July 21, he said.  
 Under Ivorian law, journalists cannot be imprisoned for the
content of their articles. Only document theft is punishable.  
 The editor, publisher and managing editor of Abidjan-based
Le Nouveau Courrier were arrested on July 14 on the orders of
Abidjan Public Prosecutor Raymond Tchimou. The story, published
on the day of their arrest, disclosed the results of the probe
ordered by President  Laurent Gbagbo  after 23 senior employees of
cocoa agencies were charged with fraud and embezzlement in June
2008. The West African nation is the world’s biggest producer of
the chocolate-making ingredient.
