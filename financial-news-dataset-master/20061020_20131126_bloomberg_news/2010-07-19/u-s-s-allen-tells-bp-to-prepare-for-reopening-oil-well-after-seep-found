             Thad Allen, the U.S. official in
charge of the response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, ordered
BP Plc to prepare for reopening the company’s Macondo well after
a “seep” was detected.  
 Allen said a “seep” was found “a distance” from the
well and anomalies had been observed at the well head, in a
letter sent today to BP Chief Managing Director Bob Dudley that
was posted on a government website about the spill.  
 “I direct you to provide me a written procedure for
opening the choke valve as quickly as possible without damaging
the well should hydrocarbon seepage near the well head be
confirmed,” Allen wrote.  
 Three days of tests on the capped well showed no signs that
would prompt BP to reopen the well, Doug Suttles, chief
operating officer for exploration and production for BP, said
earlier today in a conference call from Houston.
