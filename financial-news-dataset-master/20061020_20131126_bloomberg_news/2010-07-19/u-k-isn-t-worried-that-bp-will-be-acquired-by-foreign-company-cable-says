             Business Secretary  Vince Cable  said
the U.K. government is not worried about a possible takeover of
 BP Plc  and that the company is in a strong position now that it
has managed to stem the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Cable said speculation about a bid for London-based BP,
Europe’s second-biggest energy company by market value, has
“receded.” BP shares fell as much as 50 percent after the
April 20 accident that caused the spill, raising speculation
that the company may be vulnerable to a takeover.  
 “I would just emphasize it’s a very strong company, that
it’s got a very good cash flow, a very strong balance sheet, so
the whole issue may simply go away, particularly as they seem to
have accomplished the first stage of capping operations,”
Cable, a former chief economist with Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said
in an interview at the Farnborough Air Show in southern England
today. “It’s not an issue that I think we need to be worried
about.”  
 BP is seeking funds to pay for the biggest U.S. oil spill
in history. Talks to sell half its stake in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay
oil field to Houston-based  Apache Corp . stalled twice over the
weekend, raising doubts about whether the deal will be
completed, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  
 Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince  Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed   Al Nahyan , a member of the board of one of the world’s largest
sovereign wealth funds, said July 13 the emirate is considering
an investment in BP.  
 The cost of the response to the spill has risen to $3.95
billion, BP said in a statement today. The shares fell as much
as 7.4 percent in London and traded at 396.1 pence as of 2:19
a.m. local time. That’s 40 percent lower than when the spill
began three months ago.
