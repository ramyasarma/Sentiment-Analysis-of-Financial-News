             Mexico’s peso gained for the first
time in four days as stocks in the U.S., the nation’s largest
trade partner, rose as optimism about earnings from technology
and energy companies overshadowed a drop in financial shares.  
 The peso increased 0.3 percent to 12.9021 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.9350 on July 16. The peso has gained
1.5 percent this year against the U.S. dollar, the third-best
performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
behind Japan’s yen and Singapore’s dollar.  
 “Earnings are influencing the gain in the peso,” said
 Ramon Cordova , a currency strategist at Base Internacional Casa
de Bolsa SA in Monterrey, Mexico. “The correlation between the
peso and the performance of stock exchanges has been very
high.”  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.6 percent after the
index dropped 2.9 percent on July 16. Microsoft Corp. rallied
1.4 percent to help lead technology stocks higher after UBS AG
increased earnings estimates, while Halliburton Co. surged on
profit and sales that topped analysts’ projections.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in 2024 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.90 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.08 centavo to 128.25 centavos on the peso.  
 The government will exchange as much as 10 billion pesos
($775 million) of 8 percent notes due in December for bonds
maturing in 2012, 2013 and 2014, the central bank said on its
website.  
 The notes maturing in December 2012 and June 2013 will have
an interest rate of 9 percent, the bank said. The bonds due in
December 2013 will have an interest rate of 8 percent. The bonds
due in June 2014 will have a coupon of 7 percent.  
 Traders didn’t trigger any of the $600 million in dollar
options available today, the central bank said on its website.
The bank has been auctioning the options monthly, allowing it to
purchase dollars to boost foreign reserves after the peso
reached a record low last year.
