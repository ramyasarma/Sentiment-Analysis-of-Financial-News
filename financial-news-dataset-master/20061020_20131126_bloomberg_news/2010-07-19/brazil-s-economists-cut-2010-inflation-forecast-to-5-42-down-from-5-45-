             Analysts covering the Brazilian
economy raised their 12-month  inflation  forecast for a third
straight week, cementing expectations that the central bank will
raise the benchmark interest rate to 11 percent this week.  
 Consumer prices will increase 4.96 percent in the next 12
months, compared with a previous forecast of 4.9 percent,
according to the median forecast in a July 16 central bank
 survey  of about 100 economists published today. Economists held
their 2010 economic growth forecast at 7.2 percent.  
 Policy makers meeting July 20-21 will raise the  overnight
rate  for a third consecutive time by 0.75 percentage point in a
bid to slow an  economic expansion  that is stoking inflation,
according to all 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Latin
America’s biggest economy will expand at the fastest pace in
more than two decades in 2010 as consumer prices exceed the
government’s 4.5 percent target, the bank survey shows.  
 “Looking at the figures, I see no reason for policy makers
to ease the pace of interest rate increases,”  Zeina Latif ,
chief economist at ING Bank NV in Sao Paulo, said in a phone
interview. “I expect the 12-month inflation outlook to ease,
but it isn’t happening yet.”  
 The yield on interest-rate future contract maturing in
January, the most traded is Sao Paulo, rose 0.02 percentage
point, or 2 basis points, to 11.08 percent at 11:28 a.m. New
York time. Yields on the 13 most-traded contracts tracked by
Bloomberg increased in trading today.  
 Lower Forecasts  
 Slower-than-predicted inflation in June led economists to
reduce their 2010 year-end inflation forecast for a second
straight week to 5.42 percent from 5.45 percent, the central
bank survey shows.  
 Consumer prices, as measured by the benchmark IPCA index,
remained  unchanged  in June, the slowest inflation in four years,
the national statistic agency said July 7. The reading was lower
than expected by all 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Inflation didn’t slow enough to allow economists to lower
their inflation rate forecast for the 12 months ahead, which is
the main concern of the central bank, Latif said.
