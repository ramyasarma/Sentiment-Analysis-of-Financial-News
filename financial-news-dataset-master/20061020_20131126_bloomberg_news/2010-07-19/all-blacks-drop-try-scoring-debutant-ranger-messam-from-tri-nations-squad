             New Zealand dropped winger Rene
Ranger and flanker Liam Messam from its Tri-Nations rugby squad
for the July 31 match against Australia in Melbourne.  
 Ranger was replaced by  Joe Rokocoko  in the 26-man roster
named today even after scoring on his starting debut two days
ago in the 31-17 win over South Africa. Victor Vito, who missed
that match because of a calf injury, comes in for Messam.  
 Scrum-half Alby Mathewson will assemble with the squad as
cover for  Piri Weepu , who is preparing for the birth of his
first child, the New Zeland Rugby Union said.   
 The All Blacks head the Tri-Nations standings with 10
points from back-to-back victories over the world champion
Springboks, who face Australia on July 24 in Brisbane.  
 ALL BLACKS SQUAD:  
 Forwards: John Afoa, Anthony Boric, Tom Donnelly, Corey
Flynn, Ben Franks, Owen Franks, Jerome Kaino, Richie McCaw,
Keven Mealamu, Kieran Read, Brad Thorn, Victor Vito, Samuel
Whitelock, Tony Woodcock.  
 Backs: Daniel Carter, Jimmy Cowan, Aaron Cruden, Israel
Dagg, Cory Jane, Alby Mathewson, Mils Muliaina, Ma’a Nonu,
Josevata Rokocoko, Conrad Smith, Benson Stanley, Piri Weepu.
