             The California State Teachers’
Retirement System, the second-biggest U.S. public pension fund,
earned 12.3 percent in the year ended June 30, led by gains in
stocks and bonds that offset losses in real estate.  
 Calstrs, as the Sacramento-based fund is known, ended the
fiscal year with $129.8 billion under management, up from $118.8
billion a year earlier. Stock holdings earned 14.5 percent and
its bonds rose 12.3 percent, the fund reported today.
Investments in private equity funds rose 21.7 percent, while
real estate fell 12.4 percent.  
 “We’re not out of the woods yet,” Calstrs Chief
Investment Officer  Christopher J. Ailman  said in a statement.
“The American economy suffered a near-death experience in 2008,
and it’s going to take some time to fully recuperate from
that.”  
 The gain comes as the fund that provides  benefits  for
833,000 public school and community college teachers plans to
ask lawmakers in 2011 for an increase of as much as 14 percent
to what the state and school districts already pay toward
employee retirement benefits.  
 The fund  lost 25 percent  in 2009, led by a 43 percent drop
in real-estate and a 28 percent decline in private-equity. The
pension said in January that its unfunded liability, the
difference between assets and anticipated future costs, had
almost doubled to $42.6 billion since June 2008.  
 The fund’s board in June voted to launch a commodities
program as part of an inflation-linked asset class. The category
can account for as much as 5 percent of holdings.  
 Commodity prices  surged 23 percent last year as the outlook
for global economic growth, led by China, the fastest-growing
consumer of raw materials, spurred demand for metals, energy and
grains. Higher prices have drawn increased interest from hedge-
fund managers and pension funds.  
 The California Public Employees’ Retirement System is the
largest public pension fund in the U.S., with $201.5 billion of
assets as of June 2.
