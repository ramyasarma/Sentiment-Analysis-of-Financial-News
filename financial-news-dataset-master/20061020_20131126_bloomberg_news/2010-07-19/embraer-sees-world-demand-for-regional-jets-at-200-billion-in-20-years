             Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica
SA , world’s fourth-largest aircraft maker, expects airlines
demand for regional jets at $200 billion in the next 20 years,
boosted by Chinese air traffic growth.  
 Embraer, as the company is known, said airlines will buy
6,875 jets with 30-120 seats, according to an e-mailed
statement. The aircraft maker forecasts air traffic average
annual growth in China of 7.3 percent in the next 20 years,
while it sees world air traffic to increase 4.9 percent yearly
on average.  
 “Asia Pacific and China will represent more than one-third
of world’s air traffic by 2029,´´ the statement said. Embraer
sees U.S. and Europe representing 44 percent of the world air
traffic by 2029, down from 57 percent last year.  
 The company said it expects most of the demand will be for
jets seating 61 to 120 passengers, helping airlines to improve
efficiency by reducing excess capacity. The Sao Jose dos Campos,
Brazil-based company sees the 50-seat jets market saturated, the
statement said.  
 Embraer said it agreed to sell five 195 models to Azul
Linhas Aereas Brasileiras, which is already included in its
second-quarter backlog, and two 190 model to Trip Linhas Aereas,
according to two others e-mailed statements.  
 Embraer rose 0.5 percent to 9.50 reais in Sao Paulo trading
at 12:04 p.m. New York time.
