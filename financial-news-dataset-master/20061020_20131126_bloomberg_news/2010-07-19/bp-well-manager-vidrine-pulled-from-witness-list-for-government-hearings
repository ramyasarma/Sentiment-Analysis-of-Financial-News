             BP Plc  well manager Donald Vidrine
won’t testify this week at government hearings in Louisiana
about the cause of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the
Gulf of Mexico.  
 Vidrine was pulled from the witness list today because of
medical reasons, said Sue Kerver, a U.S. Coast Guard
spokeswoman.  
 Wyman Wheeler, a Transocean Ltd. toolpusher, also won’t be
testifying due to medical reasons, Coast Guard Captain Hung
Nguyen, co-chairman of the investigative panel, said during
today’s hearing.  
 Transocean’s rig, which was leased by BP to drill the
company’s Macondo well, exploded on April 20, leading to the
deaths of 11 people and the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
