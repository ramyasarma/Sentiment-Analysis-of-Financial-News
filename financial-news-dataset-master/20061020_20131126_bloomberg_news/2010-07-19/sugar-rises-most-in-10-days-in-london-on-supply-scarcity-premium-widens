             Raw-sugar futures climbed to a
three-month high on signs that increased demand will prolong a
global production deficit, forcing food companies to dig deeper
into inventories. Coffee declined.  
 Sudan’s state-run news agency said the country will import
400,000 metric tons by October to help meet a local shortfall.
Sugar has rallied 35 percent since touching a 13-month low on
May 7.  
 “The fundamentals remain bullish,” said  Bruno Zaneti , a
risk-management consultant at FCStone Group in Campinas, Brazil.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.5 cent, or 2.9
percent, to 17.61 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching 17.7 cents, the highest price for a most-active
contract since April 15. The commodity climbed 3 percent last
week.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, white-sugar futures for October
delivery jumped $14, or 2.7 percent, to $534 a metric ton, the
biggest gain since July 2.  
 White sugar’s price  premium  over raw sweetener climbed to
the highest level since June 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Rain delayed raw-sugar shipments from the Brazilian
port of Santos, Sucden Financial Ltd. said. Brazil is the
world’s biggest grower and exporter.  
 “The main problem is getting raw sugar,” said  Nick Penney , a broker at Sucden in London. “In the meantime, there’s
good demand for white sugar in many markets, including Pakistan
and the Middle East.”  
 In New York, arabica-coffee futures for September delivery
declined 3.25 cents, or 2 percent, to $1.638 a pound, falling
for the second straight session. On Liffe, robusta-coffee
futures for September delivery fell $34, or 1.9 percent, to
$1,730 a ton, down for the first session in five.
