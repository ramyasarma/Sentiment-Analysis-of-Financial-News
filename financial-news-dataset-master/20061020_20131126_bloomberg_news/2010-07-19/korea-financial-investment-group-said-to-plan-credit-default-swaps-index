             The  Korea Financial Investment
Association  plans to introduce a benchmark for credit-default
swaps on the nation’s corporate bonds, according to two
officials at the group.  
 Swaps on notes sold by companies, banks, card issuers and
finance leasing firms may be tracked by the index, which the
association plans to start in the fourth quarter of this year,
said one of the officials, who asked not to be identified as
details are still being determined.  
 The index will help to invigorate trading of over-the-
counter derivatives in South Korea, said one of the officials.
The group, also known as KOFIA, is a non-profit organization
that promotes the nation’s capital markets.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities if a borrower fails to
meet its debt agreements.  
 South Korea plans to establish a central clearinghouse for
over-the-counter derivatives trading in 2012, the  Financial
Services Commission  said in February.  
 Clearinghouses reduce the default risk between parties and
let regulators assess market positions and prices. Derivatives
are financial instruments derived from stocks, bonds, loans,
currencies and commodities, or linked to specific events such as
changes in interest rates.
