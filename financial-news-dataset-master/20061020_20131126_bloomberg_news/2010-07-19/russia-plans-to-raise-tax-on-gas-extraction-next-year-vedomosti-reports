             Russia’s government agreed to raise 
its tax on extracting natural-gas next year, Vedomosti 
reported, citing unidentified officials.  
 The government is still discussing the size of the 
increase, which will probably be 10 percent or 15 percent, the 
Moscow-based newspaper said.   
 OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas company, would have to
pay an extra 11.8 billion rubles ($386 million) a year if the 
tax is increased 15 percent, Vedomosti said, citing analyst 
estimates.
