             Investors are buying longer-maturity
corporate bonds at the fastest pace in more than three months,
speculating that declining inflation expectations will keep the
Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.  
 Charles Schwab Corp.  and  Bancolombia SA  sold $1.2 billion
of notes due in 2020 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That followed $14.6 billion of issuance last week of
debt due in 10 years or more, the most since the period ended
March 26. Investment-grade bonds due in 10 to 15 years returned
1.22 percent this month, the best-performing maturity range,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  
 Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have lost 1.25
percent this month, the worst performance for the debt since
December, signaling investors are less concerned that quickening
inflation will erode the value of their bonds. Futures show a
13.6 percent chance the Fed will raise its target rate for
overnight loans between banks by at least a quarter-percentage
point by December, down from 21.4 percent a month ago.  
 “You’re getting more bang for your buck” in longer-
maturity bonds, said  Jason Brady , a managing director at
Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which
oversees $59 billion.  
 Treasuries due in 10 years yield 2.38 percentage points
more than U.S. government debt maturing in two years, compared
with a 2.7 percentage-point gap at the end of 2009, Bloomberg
data show. The so-called yield curve has flattened as
expectations for faster inflation decline, said  John Milne ,
chief executive officer of JKMilne Asset Management, who
oversees about $1.8 billion in Fort Myers, Florida.  
 ‘Less of a Fear’  
 “We have less of a fear of the long end of the market,”
Milne said.  
 Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds rather than government debt
remained at the lowest since May. Corporate bond spreads were at
187 basis points, or 1.87 percentage points, unchanged from July
16, which was the lowest since May 20, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market Corporate Index. The
gap was 142 on April 21 before expanding to as much as 201 on
June 11. Yields rose to 3.87 percent from 3.856 percent at the
end of last week.  
 The cost of protecting company debt in the U.S. fell, with
the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or
speculate on creditworthiness, declining 0.15 basis point to a
mid-price of 112.83 basis points as of 12:15 p.m. in New York,
according to Markit Group Ltd. In London, the Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings dropped 0.5 basis point to 119.65 basis points.  
 Bondholder Protection  
 Both indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves
and rise as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a swap protecting $10 million of bonds and loans.  
 Returns this month on investment-grade bonds due in 10 to
15 years compare with a gain of 0.53 percent for securities due
in 1 to 3 years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  
 Schwab’s $600 million of 10-year, 4.45 percent senior notes
priced to yield 150 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The San Francisco-based company boosted the offering from
$500 million. Schwab last sold debt in June 2009, issuing $750
million of 5-year, 4.95 percent notes that priced to yield 250
basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show.  
 Calpine Offering  
 Bancolombia , Colombia’s largest lender, sold $620 million
of subordinated bonds after boosting the size of the offering by
$20 million. The 10-year notes pay a spread of 337.5 basis
points, Bloomberg data show.  
 Calpine Corp.  plans to sell $750 million of senior secured
notes due in 2020, the Houston-based power producer said in a
statement distributed by Business Wire. The debt may be sold as
soon as today, said a person familiar with the transaction who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set. Proceeds
will be used to repay part of a term loan, the company said.  
 While Fed policy makers may leave the benchmark interest
rate near zero to help invigorate the economy, the cost of
living in the U.S., excluding food and energy prices, climbed in
June more than forecast. Prices may fall as yields on
investment-grade corporate bonds due in 10 to 15 years hover
near the lowest since 2005, Brady said.  
 The yield rose to 5.421 percent yesterday, from 5.399
percent on July 16, the lowest since September 2005, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show.  
 “Yields can’t go lower forever,” Thornburg’s Brady said.
