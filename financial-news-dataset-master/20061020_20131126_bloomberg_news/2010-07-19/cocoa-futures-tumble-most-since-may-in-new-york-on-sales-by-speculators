             Cocoa futures tumbled the most since
May on sales by speculators following a rally to a 10-week high.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position, or bets on New York futures, by 5.2
percent in the week ended July 13 from a week earlier,
government data show. On July 16, the price reached $3,210 a
metric ton, the highest level since May 6.  
 “Some funds are unwinding their positions,” said Jim
Goens, a senior market strategist at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago. “There is a lot of volatility in the market.”  
 Cocoa for September delivery slumped $184, or 5.8 percent,
to $2,981 on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, marking the biggest
decline since May 7. Last week, the price gained 5.6 percent.  
 On the Liffe exchange in London, cocoa futures for
September delivery fell 100 pounds, or 4.1 percent, to 2,345
pounds ($3,570) a ton.
