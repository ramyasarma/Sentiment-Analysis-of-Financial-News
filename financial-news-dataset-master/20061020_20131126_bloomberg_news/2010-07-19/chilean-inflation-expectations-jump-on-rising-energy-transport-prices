             Chilean inflation-linked swap rates
tumbled and bond yields fell to the lowest in more than a month
on prospects of accelerating consumer prices.  
 The six-month rate dropped 46 basis points, the most since
January, to minus 1.36 percent, pushing the six-month breakeven
inflation rate up 57 basis points to 4.02 percent. The one-year
breakeven inflation rate, a measure of expectations for future
inflation as priced into the swaps market, increased 35 basis
points to 4.22 percent.  
 Traders are pricing in an increase in the cost of
electricity, rising public-transport fares and higher
international oil prices. The central bank increased its
benchmark overnight rate by half a percentage point on July 15,
Chile’s last trading day, not enough to offset the increase in
inflation priced into the swaps market.  
 “There are some inflation shocks the market is pricing
in,” said  German Fritsch , head of trading at Deutsche Bank AG.  
 The yield on a basket of inflation-linked central bank
bonds due in five years dropped five basis points to 2.30
percent, the lowest in more than a month.  
 The inflation forwards market is pricing in a 0.64 percent
increase in consumer prices this month, up from 0.57 percent on
July 15, according to Banco Santander SA prices. Inflation
forwards imply prices will rise 3.92 percent this year, up 20
basis points from July 15 and 40 basis points from a month ago.  
 An increase in fares on Santiago’s Transantiago public
transport system came into effect on July 17.  
 The one-year interest-rate swap rate, a measure of traders’
expectations for future borrowing costs, rose 11 basis points to
3.33 percent, the highest since February 2009. The two-year and
three-year swap rates rose seven basis points to 3.96 percent
and 4.43 percent respectively.  
 The central bank policy committee, led by President  Jose De Gregorio,  increased its benchmark  overnight rate  to 1.5 percent,
matching economists’ forecasts. The bank increased by half a
percentage point for the second straight month and warned that
it expects to keep tightening monetary policy.  
 The peso was little changed at 533.05 per U.S. dollar, from
532.85 on July 15, and reached 530.05. Markets were closed July
16 for a national holiday.
