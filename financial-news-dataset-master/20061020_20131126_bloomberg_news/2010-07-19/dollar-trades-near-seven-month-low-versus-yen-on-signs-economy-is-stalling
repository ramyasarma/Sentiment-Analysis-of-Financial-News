             The dollar was near a seven-month
low against the yen as signs the U.S. economic recovery is
stalling damped demand for the nation’s assets.  
 The U.S. currency traded near a two-month low versus the
euro before reports this week that economists said will show the
U.S. housing market is slowing. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke is scheduled to give his semiannual report to the
Senate Banking Committee tomorrow. Demand for the yen waned
after Dow Jones Newswires yesterday reported the Bank of Japan
may ease monetary policy should the currency stay around 85 per
dollar. Japanese markets were shut yesterday for a holiday.  
 “We are seeing more negative economic data than we had
expected,” said  Manabu Tamaru , a senior investment manager at
Baring Asset Management in Tokyo. “The market focus is turning
to negative factors against the dollar, as investors become wary
of selling the euro.”  
 The dollar fetched 86.70 yen as of 8:15 a.m. in Tokyo from
86.69 in New York yesterday. The U.S. currency touched 86.27 yen
on July 16, the lowest since Dec. 1. The greenback was at
$1.2937 per euro from $1.2942. It reached $1.3008 per euro on
July 16, the weakest since May 10. The yen traded at 112.16 per
euro from 112.19.  
 U.S. housing starts fell 2.7 percent to a 577,000 annual
rate in June, according to the median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce Department’s data
today. Sales of U.S. existing homes dropped 9.9 percent to a 5.1
million annual rate last month, according to another survey
before the data on July 22.
