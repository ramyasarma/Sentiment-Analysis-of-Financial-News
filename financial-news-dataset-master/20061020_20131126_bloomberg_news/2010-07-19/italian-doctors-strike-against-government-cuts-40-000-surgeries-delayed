             Italian doctors today begin a strike
against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s planned budget cuts
in a protest that will lead to 40,000 surgeries being postponed.  
 Physicians belonging to CGIL, Italy’s biggest union, won’t
show up for work in public hospitals and doctors will only
guarantee services for emergencies,  according to a statement  on
CGIL’s website. About 30,000 doctors retiring over the next four
years won’t be replaced because of a hiring freeze, while about
12,000 health-care employees won’t have their temporary
contracts renewed, daily la Repubblica reported.  
 Berlusconi, whose popularity is at its lowest since coming
to power, is seeking parliamentary approval for 25 billion euros
($31.5 billion) in deficit cuts for the next two years as part
of an effort to shore up confidence in the euro region after
Greece’s near-default. The measures include a wage freeze for
civil servants, a reduction in payments to regional governments
and delaying the retirement of workers.  
 The budget cuts aim to bring Italy’s deficit of 5.3 percent
of gross domestic product within the European Union limit of 3
percent in 2012.
