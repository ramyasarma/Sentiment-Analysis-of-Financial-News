             Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , Bulgaria’s
former exiled king and prime minister between 2001 and 2005,
will sue the county in the European Court of Human Rights over
suspended property rights,  Mediapool.bg  news website reported.  
 Saxe-Coburg told Prime Minister  Boiko Borissov  and
Agriculture Minister Miroslav Naidenov about his intentions,
Mediapool said, citing unidentified sources.  
 Bulgaria’s parliament imposed a freeze in December on Saxe-
Coburg’s rights to sell woods and former royal residences that
were returned to him when he was in power, after prosecutors
found irregularities in the restitution process, Mediapool said.
Saxe-Coburg wants to overturn the ban.  
 The estates and forests were state owned after the former
communist regime seized them in 1946 and forced Saxe-Coburg-
Gotha’s family into exile.  
 Bulgaria’s Agriculture Ministry has filed a claim in the
Sofia City Court against Saxe-Coburg, demanding he returns some
1,600 hectares of woods in the Rila mountains that the ministry
claims were given to him in violation of the law, Mediapool
said.  
 Saxe-Coburg’s office in Sofia declined to comment, when
contacted by phone by Bloomberg.
