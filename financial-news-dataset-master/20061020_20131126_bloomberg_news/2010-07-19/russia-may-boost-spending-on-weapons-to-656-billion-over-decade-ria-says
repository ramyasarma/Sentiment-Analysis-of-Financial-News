             Russia’s government may increase the
Defense Ministry budget for arms purchases this decade by about
half to 20 trillion rubles ($656 billion), RIA Novosti reported,
citing Deputy Defense Minister Vladimir Popovkin.  
 That figure, for the period 2011-2020, includes about 70
fifth-generation fighter jets, 20 Ruslan heavy-lift cargo
aircraft and 1,000 helicopters, Popovkin said at the Farnborough
Air Show in the U.K. today, according to the state-run Russian
news wire.
