             Gold prices fell to an eight-week
low on reduced investment demand.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators trimmed
their  net-long positions , or bets on a rally in Comex gold
futures, by 2 percent to 204,921 contracts in the week ended
July 13, according to government data. That marked the lowest
level since April 6. The metal has dropped 6.7 percent from a
record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21.  
 “There is no fundamental demand for gold,” said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset Management in
Evanston, Illinois. “Gold is a crowded trade, and as soon as
investors start selling, there is nobody to buy it.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery fell $6.30, or 0.5
percent, to $1,181.90 on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
price touched $1,176.90, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since May 24.  
 “Price direction is probably down for this week, and gold
will spend more time around the $1,180 and $1,190 levels,” said
 Robin Bhar , a metals analyst at Credit Agricole CIB in London.
“Prices looked overbought, and everybody was very long.”  
 The decline may accelerate should the price settle below
the 100-day moving average,  Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT
Capital Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland, said before the
market closed.  
 The moving average is $1,177.58. The metal has gained 7.8
percent this year.  
 Silver futures for September delivery dropped 24.5 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $17.543 an ounce.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $1 to $1,513.10
an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery fell $4.70, or 1
percent, to $443.90 an ounce.
