             U.K. government bonds declined,
pushing the 10-year yield up from near the lowest in 15 months,
as stock-market gains reduced demand for the safest assets amid
optimism that Britain’s economic recovery is gathering pace.  
 Two-year securities reversed a gain that pushed the yield
to the lowest in a week in the wake of Ireland’s credit
downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service. The country’s FTSE 100
Index of stocks gained 0.2 percent after losing as much as 0.9
percent. A report tomorrow will probably show that U.K. banks
increased mortgage approvals last month, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  
 Markets are feeling “crisis fatigue” and investors are
looking for more risk, said  David Schnautz , a fixed income
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “The Ireland downgrade
was expected. The outlook is now stable, and there is now less
negative news flow, and this plays through many asset prices.”  
 The  yield  on the 10-year gilt increased one basis point to
3.33 percent as of 11 a.m. in London, after dropping to 3.299
percent earlier, the least since April 21, 2009. The 4.75
percent security maturing in March 2020 lost 0.12, or 1.2 pounds
per 1,000-pound ($1,528) face amount, to 111.52. The two-year
yield rose three basis points to 0.76 percent, after being as
low as 0.723 percent, matching its level on July 12.  
 The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5278 and was 0.4 percent
weaker at 84.82 pence.  
 Gilts returned 6.4 percent so far this year, compared with
a profit of 6.7 percent for German bunds, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.
