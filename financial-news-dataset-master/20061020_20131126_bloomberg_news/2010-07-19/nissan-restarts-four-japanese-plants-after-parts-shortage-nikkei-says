             Nissan Motor Co. restarted four
domestic plants yesterday, after a shortage of electronic engine
parts from Hitachi Ltd. forced a shutdown for three days last
week, the Nikkei newspaper said. Plants in Mississippi and
Tennessee will restart today, according to the report, which
didn’t cite anyone.
