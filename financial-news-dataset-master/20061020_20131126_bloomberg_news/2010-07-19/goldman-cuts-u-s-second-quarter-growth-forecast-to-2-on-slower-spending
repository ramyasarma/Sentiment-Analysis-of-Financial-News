             A surge in  imports  and slower
consumer spending reduced U.S. economic growth in the second
quarter, according to economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  
 The world’s largest economy grew at a 2 percent annual pace
from April through June, down from a previously estimated 3
percent pace, according to revised estimates by Goldman
economists. Forecasts for the second half of the year remained
at an average 1.5 percent pending the government’s annual
revisions to gross domestic product due July 30.  
 “At that point, we may need to make downward revisions,
judging from the relentless run on disappointments in recent
weeks,”  Ed McKelvey , a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in New
York wrote in a July 16 note to clients. “While it is
conceivable that the slowdown will prove fleeting, several
factors strongly suggest otherwise.”  
 Among the issues that will damp growth in the second half
are the loss of support from fiscal stimulus and inventory
replenishment, the excess supply of vacant housing, state and
local budget constraints, a lack of credit, and weak employment
gains, McKelvey said.  
 The cut in the growth forecast follows similar reductions
by economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS Securities LLC in
New York.
