             (Corrects to show that restrictions will be introduced on
July 28, not Aug. 28, in the second paragraph. Story was first
published on July 19.)  
 Sudanese will only be able to obtain
foreign currency for trips abroad from the airport, the
country’s central bank said today, in a move to prevent
shortages of hard currency in the African country.  
 From July 28, exchange offices will only redeem Sudanese
pounds for foreign cash at airport departure halls, the
Khartoum-based bank said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The procedure has been introduced “to prove the
seriousness of travelers,” Khaled Mohamed Adam, information
officer at the central bank, said today by phone from Khartoum.
“There have been some incidents where people brought fake
tickets or visas to obtain foreign currency.”  
 Sudan, under U.S. economic sanctions, depends on oil
exports and foreign investment from China, India and oil-rich
Gulf Arab countries. The country is sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest oil producer, producing about 490,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.  
 The country’s foreign-exchange reserves were at $956.2
million in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
