             Chevron Corp. , the second-largest
U.S. oil company, signed an agreement with Korea Gas Corp. for
the delivery of liquefied natural gas from the company’s
Wheatstone project in Australia.  
 Korea Gas, the largest LNG buyer in the world according to
a statement today, expects to purchase 1.5 million tons a year
of the fuel for as many as 20 years. About 75 percent of the
purchases are expected to be through San Ramon, California-based
Chevron, with the remaining 25 percent to be bought from
Wheatstone partners Apache Corp. and the Kuwait Foreign
Petroleum Exploration Co., Korea Gas said.  
 Korea Gas also plans to acquire 5 percent in the Wheatstone
project, according to the statement and a separate release from
Apache.  
 Gareth Johnstone , a spokesman for Chevron in Singapore,
declined to give the agreement’s value.  
 Chevron rose 50 cents to $72 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving,
Texas, is the biggest U.S. oil company.
