             Investors should buy subordinate
bonds backed by credit-card payments as defaults fall and
delinquencies slow, according to Wells Fargo Securities.  
 Asset-backed securities tied to credit-card debt and rated
BBB, the second-lowest investment grade, yield almost 200 basis
points more than similar top-rated bonds, Wells Fargo analysts
said in a July 16 report. Though spreads aren’t likely to narrow
significantly under current market conditions, the lower-ranked
bonds offer higher yields without undue credit risk, according
to the analysts led by  John McElravey .  
 Credit-card charge-offs declined to 9.60 percent this month
from 10.15 percent in June, while delinquencies fell for the
fifth straight month to 3.74 percent, according to Wells Fargo.
Charge-offs are accounts deemed uncollectible.  
 Credit-card performance “will likely continue to improve
over time,” the Charlotte, North Carolina-based analysts said.  
 Outstanding credit-card debt for the largest asset-backed
issuers declined for the sixth consecutive month in July to $327
billion, $3.8 billion below the level in June, according to
Wells Fargo data. Tight lending markets and reduced demand are
shrinking banks’ credit-card businesses, the analysts said.  
 Sales of bonds tied to credit-card payments have plummeted
78 percent to $6 billion in 2010 compared with a year ago as
banks ratchet back lending and rely on deposits to fund new
loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 McElravey didn’t immediately return a call seeking further
comment.
