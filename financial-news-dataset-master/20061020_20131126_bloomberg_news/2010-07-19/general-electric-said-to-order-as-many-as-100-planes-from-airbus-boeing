             General Electric Co.’s GECAS
aircraft leasing unit is set to announce a combined order for as
many as 100 single-aisle jets from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. at
the Farnborough Air Show, two people familiar with the planned
announcements said.  
 Airbus will likely secure a commitment for 60 A320
aircraft, while Boeing will sell GECAS 40 737s, said the people,
who spoke on condition of anonymity because the accord has not
been announced.
