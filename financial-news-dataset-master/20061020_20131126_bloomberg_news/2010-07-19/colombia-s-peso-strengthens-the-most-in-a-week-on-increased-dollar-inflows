             Colombia’s peso rose the most in a
week amid increased dollar inflows and speculation foreign
direct investment into oil and mining will continue to boost
flows into the South American nation.  
 The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,875.40 per U.S. dollar
at 3:07 p.m. New York time, from 1,877.85 on July 16. The
currency has jumped 9 percent this year versus the dollar, the
best performance among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
Colombian markets are closed tomorrow for Independence Day.  
 “Banks have seen some flows come in,” said Andres Munoz,
head currency trader at Corporacion Financiera Colombiana SA in
Bogota. “Because of the little volume, whatever trading there
is leads to a bigger move than normal.”  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.46
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price rose 0.043 centavo to 124.358 centavos per peso.
