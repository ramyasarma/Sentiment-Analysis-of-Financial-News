             Intertrust Holdings AD, a Bulgarian
metal producer that controls the Kardjali lead and zinc
smelters, is seeking $150 million to upgrade its facilities and
double output and sales, said Chairman  Valentin Zahariev .  
 Smelter improvements at Intertrust’s Olovno Tzinkov Komplex
AD unit will be completed by 2013 and will help almost double
annual sales to $220 million from $120 million in 2009,
Zahariev, said in a July 16 interview in Sofia.  
 Bulgaria’s Environment Ministry approved a 40 million-euro
($51.7 million) upgrade of the lead smelter a week ago and the
company now has to raise the funding, he said. Intertrust is
also building an 80 million-euro galvanized steel plant near
Sofia on the site of an old pipe factory, with planned output of
600,000 tons of galvanized steel a year, he said.  
 “We need to raise a total of $150 million to complete our
investment projects,” said Zahariev. “We have applied for
financing from U.S. funds for part of it. We will also consider
other forms including an IPO, corporate bonds or bank loans. It
all depends on the cost.”  
 Intertrust has already borrowed 85 million euros in loans
from Swiss banks to upgrade its zinc smelter, he said. Asturiana
de Zinc SA, a Spanish zinc producer, designed the project and
supplied the equipment, according to Zahariev.  
 Smelter Modernization  
 The modernized zinc smelter will increase output to 45,000
tons from 24,000 tons in 2009, while the lead smelter will
double output to 60,000 tons from 30,000 tons, he said.  
 “The modernization of the two units will help cut
pollution, reduce greenhouse emissions, improve the quality of
all of our products, double output and cut costs,” said
Zahariev.  
 Zahariev ran Bulgaria’s biggest steel mill, Kremikovtzi,
before selling it in 2005 to  Pramod Mittal , the younger brother
of ArcelorMittal Chief Executive Officer  Lakshmi Mittal .  
 Apart from the Gorubso mines in Madan in southern Bulgaria,
Intertrust also runs five metal, tool and engineering plants in
neighboring Serbia. The company exports 85 percent of its output
mostly to Italy, Germany, Austria and Turkey, Zahariev said.  
 Zahariev forecast this year’s output of Olovno Tzinkov
Komplex at 20,000 tons of zinc and 19,000 tons of lead, 16
percent and 11 percent, respectively, less than in 2009, because
of the ongoing upgrades.
