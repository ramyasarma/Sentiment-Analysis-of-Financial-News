             Moscow’s heat wave claimed 25
drowning victims over the weekend as residents sought refuge
from the worst heat wave in decades, Interfax reported, citing
unidentified health officials.  
 July 17 will go down in history as a “black” day, after a
single-day record 11 people drowned in the Russian capital, the
news service said.
