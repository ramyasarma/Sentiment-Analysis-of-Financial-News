             Ireland is likely to sell the full
allotment of up to 1.5 billion euros of 2016 and 2020 bonds
tomorrow, even after the nation’s debt rating was downgraded by
Moody’s Investors Service today, according to ING Groep NV.  
 The sales “are likely to go well in line with the
Portuguese auctions last week, given the large concession priced
in,” Wilson Chin, a senior debt strategist at ING Bank NV in
Amsterdam, wrote in a research note today. “The supply will be
rather light this week.”  
 The difference in yield, or spread, between Irish and
German 10-year goverment bonds widened 10 basis points to 293
basis points as of 9:04 a.m. in London.
