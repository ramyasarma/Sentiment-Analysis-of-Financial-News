             Hasbro Inc. , the world’s second-
largest toymaker, said second-quarter profit increased 11
percent as operating margins widened on lower royalty and
advertising costs.  
 Net income  rose to $43.6 million, or 29 cents a share, from
$39.3 million, or 26 cents, the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based
company said today in a statement. Total sales in the period
ended June 27 fell 7 percent to $737.8 million.  
 Sales in Hasbro’s boys business tumbled 34 percent from a
year earlier when revenue was spurred by the “Transformers”
and “G.I. Joe” movies based on its toy brands.  Mattel Inc. ,
the world’s largest toymaker, last week reported its second-
quarter profit more than doubled, helped by sales tied to the
third film in the “Toy Story” franchise.  
 Analysts predicted 24 cents a share, the average of 13
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Costs related to Hasbro’s joint
venture with  Discovery Communications Inc. , a children’s
television network named The Hub, totaled 5 cents, compared with
6 cents a year earlier.  
 The network begins airing programming on Oct. 10, Chief
Executive Officer  Brian Goldner  said in a conference call today.
The channel will be available in 60 million homes and feature
programs based on Hasbro brands such as My Little Pony.  
 Profit Margin  
 The operating profit margin widened to 10.8 percent from
9.2 percent. Royalty costs fell 32 percent to $50.1 million,
reflecting the drop in sales of movie-related toys, and made up
a smaller percentage of revenue. Advertising expenses dropped 12
percent to $72 million.  
 Hasbro  fell  15 cents to $39.35 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 23
percent this year.  
 The toymaker repurchased 6.7 million of its shares for
$271.4 million during the quarter. Since its buyback program
began in June 2005, Hasbro has bought 70.3 million shares for
$1.9 billion, the company said.  
 Hasbro, the maker of Nerf toys and Monopoly, last month
denied that it was in discussions regarding a possible takeover
and said the board spurned an approach from a private-equity
firm. Providence Equity Partners Inc. was in talks with Hasbro,
a person familiar with the matter said at the time.
