             Keiko Fujimori , a Peruvian
congresswoman and daughter of jailed former Peruvian president
 Alberto Fujimori , has increased her lead in an opinion poll
before April’s presidential election, El Comercio  reported .  
 Fujimori, 35, had the support of 22 percent of those
surveyed, unchanged from last month, the Lima-based newspaper
said, citing survey group  Ipsos Apoyo .  
 Support for Lima Mayor  Luis Castaneda  slipped 1 percentage
point to 20 percent. Former President  Alejandro Toledo  had 14
percent support and opposition politician  Ollanta Humala  had 12
percent, the newspaper said. Finance Minister  Mercedes Araoz ,
who appears in the poll for the first time, had 4 percent
support, El Comercio said.  
 The survey of 1,200 people this month in 17 Peruvian cities
had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points for Lima and 2.8
percentage points overall.  
 President  Alan Garcia’s  approval rating climbed to a 14-
month high of 30 percent, from 27 percent last month, according
to El Comercio.
