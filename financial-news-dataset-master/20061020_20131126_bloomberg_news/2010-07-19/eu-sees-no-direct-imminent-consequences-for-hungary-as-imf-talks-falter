             The European Union said Hungary
faces “no direct, imminent consequences” after the EU and the
International Monetary Fund ended talks with the government
without endorsing its plans to control the budget deficit.  
 “As far as I know at this stage there are no direct,
imminent consequences,” Ton van Lierop, a spokesman for the EU,
told reporters in Brussels today. “It’s also difficult to say
what the consequences would be further on.”  
 The IMF ended its review of Hungary’s 20 billion-euro
($25.8 billion) emergency bailout because “a range of issues
remain open,” the Washington-based lender said in a July 17
statement. The government must make “tough decisions, notably
on spending,” to comply with deficit requirements, the EU said
on that day.  
 Van Lierop said today that “it’s difficult to say when
exactly” the review of the Hungarian program will be completed.
“It has not been concluded at this stage because there are
several outstanding issues,” he said without elaborating.
