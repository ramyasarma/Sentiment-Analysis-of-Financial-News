             A few weeks ago, electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors issued stock to the public. Its charismatic CEO Elon Musk was once  touted by Wired  as a "triple threat" disruptor based on his previous experience with PayPal and Space Exploration Technologies. A successful stock market introduction led to Musk being worth millions, on paper at least. 

 Last week, a company called QlikTech issued stock to the public. The company is more than a decade old. Most people wouldn't recognize CEO Lars Bjork if they ran into him on the street. A Google News search found 2,180 articles about Tesla, and 68 about QlikTech. 

 Tesla's the sexier company, but is it better positioned for success? 

 I flagged QlikTech last year in  The Silver Lining  as one to watch during today's tough economic climate, noting that "Companies seeking to find prudent ways to manage in tough economic times are going to be hungry for easy, affordable ways to analyze data. QlikTech is in a great position to be the software vendor of choice to these companies." QlikTech is following a textbook disruptive approach. The company's solutions make it simple and easy for companies to run analyses to better understand their business. It has a solid business model. The company's revenues have grown from $24 million in 2005 to $157 million in 2009. It has been profitable since 2008. 

 Meanwhile, Tesla is undoubtedly following a novel approach, but it isn't adhering to the disruptive pattern. Rather, it's attempting to be performance competitive with existing solutions. Its first car — the Tesla Roadster — is sexy, and a powerful showcase of the potential of Tesla's technology. But its $100,000-plus selling price has relegated it to a niche product. The company did rack up more than $100 million in sales in 2009, but losses for the year exceeded $50 million. 

 Analysts generally expect Tesla's fortunes to come down to a car it hopes to introduce in 2012 — the "Model S" sedan targeting the mass market. That puts it in direct competition with traditional manufactures such as General Motors, whose all-electric Volt product is due to arrive later this year, and emerging players such as BYD, a Chinese company that already has an electric vehicle on the market and recently announced a  joint venture with German giant Daimler . 

 Tesla believes it has several sources of competitive differentiation. It hopes to revolutionize the car buying experience by bringing in outside talent with experience working with The Gap and Apple. The company claims that its Silicon Valley roots provide a different perspective from traditional car companies. One example? Third-party developers will be able to create "apps" for the Model S. Finally, Tesla hopes to strike novel partnerships with traditional manufacturers to help enable their move toward electric vehicles. Toyota invested $50 million in the company, and Tesla might help the company develop electric vehicles in the future. 

 My sense is that last area provides the most long-term hope for the company. It's not really a disruptive play (as we define it, at least). Rather, it involves providing the performance-enabling subsystem that helps other companies achieve their strategic goals.  

 While analytics and automobiles don't seem to have much in common, I'll be watching these two companies carefully over the next few years.
