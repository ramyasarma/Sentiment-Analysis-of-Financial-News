             Shares in the United Arab Emirates
advanced, leading gains in the Gulf, as positive second-quarter
earnings in Abu Dhabi increased confidence in local stocks.  
 Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank , the second-biggest bank complying
with Islamic banking rules, rose the most in almost three months
after second-quarter profit jumped 56 percent.  Emirates NBD
PJSC , Dubai’s biggest bank, advanced the most since April.  Abu
Dhabi’s benchmark  advanced 0.3 percent to 2,534.29, the highest
level since June 28, and Dubai’s  DFM General Index  climbed 0.7
percent.  Volume  on the measure was 44 percent below its three
month average.  
 “Regional markets are marginally higher” than global
markets today “as some slightly better earnings numbers are
compensating for low summer trading volumes,” said  Mark Friedenthal , a fund manager at  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC .  
 U.A.E. earnings are helping to set a positive tone for the
period following a year that forced some of the country’s
biggest banks and developers to post losses.  Abu Dhabi Islamic
Bank’s  profit gain follows a 9.3 percent increase in first-
quarter profit and a loss of 623.3 million dirhams ($170
million) in the fourth-quarter.  
 Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank advanced 2.5 percent, the biggest
gain since April 29, to 2.49 dirhams. Net income rose to 301.6
million dirhams from 193.4 million dirhams a year earlier as it
set aside less money to cover bad loans.  
 Aabar Offer  
 Aabar Investments PJSC , an Abu Dhabi state-controlled
company, climbed the most this year after agreeing yesterday to
increase an offer to shareholders by 34 percent as it seeks to
delist. The shares climbed 9.6 percent to 1.72 dirhams. Aabar
and its largest shareholder, Abu Dhabi government-owned
International Petroleum Investment Co., agreed to pay 1.95
dirhams a share after the market regulator sought changes to the
company’s terms for delisting its stock. Emirates NBD climbed
3.7 percent to 2.53 dirhams.  
 Savola Azizia United Co.  slid 2.3 percent to 34.6 riyals,
the lowest in two weeks. The Saudi food producer said second-
quarter profit declined 2.3 percent to 207.7 million riyals
($55.4 million) as capital gains in the year-ago period weren’t
repeated.  
 Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  and Kuwait’s gauge added 0.1 percent.
Bahrain’s  index  rose 0.2 percent and the  QE Index  in Qatar
increased 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index 
rose 0.2 percent to 6,131.30, after earlier falling as much as
0.8 percent.
