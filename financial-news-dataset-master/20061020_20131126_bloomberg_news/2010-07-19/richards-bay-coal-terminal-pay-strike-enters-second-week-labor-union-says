             A strike over pay by workers at
Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa’s largest export facility for
the fuel, entered its second week, disrupting operations, the
South African Trade and Allied Workers’ Union said.  
 About 266 of 520 workers at the terminal, which supplies
coal to power plants in Europe, are on strike, Musa Makhanya,
the union’s provincial treasurer, said by mobile phone today.
The terminal is owned by coal producers including  BHP Billiton
Ltd.  and Anglo American Plc.  
 “Operations are normal,” Zama Luthuli, a spokeswoman for
the terminal, said by mobile phone today. Between 80 and 100
workers were on strike “at last count,” she said.  
 While workers have accepted an increase of 9.5 percent this
year, they’re resisting management’s demand to also fix pay
increases for 2011 and 2012 during current talks.
