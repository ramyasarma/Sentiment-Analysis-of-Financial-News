             PulteGroup Inc.  Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Dugas  will take over responsibility for
homebuilding operations after Chief Operating Officer  Steven Petruska  leaves the company Aug. 14.  
 The COO position is being eliminated, PulteGroup said today
in a statement announcing Petruska, 51, would retire after 26
years with the Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based builder. Pulte
became the largest U.S. residential developer by sales when it
bought Dallas-based Centex Corp. for $3.3 billion last year.  
 “With the Centex merger integration essentially complete,
we are electing to flatten PulteGroup’s structure,” Dugas said
in the statement.  
 New  home  sales fell after the deadline to qualify for a
federal tax credit expired. Contracts had to be signed by April
30. U.S. new home sales dropped 33 percent to the lowest level
on record in May, the Commerce Department said June 23.  
 PulteGroup said May 5 it closed 3,795 home sales in the
first quarter of this year, down 30 percent from the 5,440 sales
Pulte and Centex reported separately during the same period of
2009.  
 PulteGroup’s  shares  fell 12 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $7.93
at 4:01 p.m. New York time on the New York Stock Exchange.  
 “I have had an amazing journey with PulteGroup,” Petruska
said in the statement. “Given that we are ahead of schedule
with many of our merger activities and our key business
initiatives are on track, this is the right time for me to
retire.”
