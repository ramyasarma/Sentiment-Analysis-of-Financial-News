             BYD Co. said a government
investigation into a possible illegal use of land will have no
“material adverse impact” on its business.  
 China’s Ministry of Land and Resources said on July 15 it
would ask local authorities to investigate a possible misuse of
the land, the Ministry of Land and Resources said in a statement
on July 15.  
 BYD said it is not in acquisition talks and doesn’t know
why its share price has recently dropped, according to a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.
