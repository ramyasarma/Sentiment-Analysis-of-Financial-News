             H&R Block Inc. , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, may get a merger proposal from closely held Liberty
Tax Service, according to Liberty founder  John Hewitt . The stock
rose as much as 5.5 percent.  
 The decline in H&R Block’s stock through last week under
Chairman  Richard Breeden  makes the Kansas City, Missouri-based
firm attractive, Hewitt said today in a phone interview. Eroding
market share and declining  revenue  have helped push the market
value below $4.7 billion and spurred a member of the founding
Bloch family to leave.  
 “If it goes much lower, it would be interesting to discuss
a possible merger between Liberty and Block,” Hewitt said.
“Breeden would have to go.”  
 Hewitt said he reached out to  Thomas Bloch , a member of the
family that built H&R Block, after Bloch said last week he’s
leaving the  board of directors  because of differences with
Breeden and the company’s strategy. Breeden is a hedge-fund
manager and former head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission who gained control of H&R Block in 2007 in a proxy
contest, saying the company had underperformed.  
 Bloch hasn’t responded to a July 14 letter, said Hewitt,
whose firm is based in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  
 “I have had no conversations with John Hewitt,” Bloch
said today in a telephone interview.  
 Kate O’Neill Rauber, a spokeswoman for H&R Block, said it’s
company policy not to comment on rumors or speculation.  
 Bloch’s Letter  
 H&R Block rose 63 cents to $14.61 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading  and sold for as much as $14.75.
The stock was the sixth-largest gainer today in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  
 In a letter sent to H&R Block’s board filed with regulators
last week, Bloch cited “fundamental” disagreements with
Breeden and said the company was “overly generous” with
compensation for Chief Executive Officer  Alan Bennett . Bloch
said a 2008 stock buyback was “ill-timed,” that the 2010
fiscal plan was “overly optimistic” and that the company
missed its own earnings target.  
 Liberty, which said it ranks among the three biggest U.S.
tax preparers, said it handled 8 percent more returns in 2010.
Jackson Hewitt reported a 14 percent decline and H&R Block a 6
percent decrease.  
 Hewitt would have “a better chance than most anyone” to
execute a turnaround at H&R Block, said  Vance Edelson , a Morgan
Stanley analyst, in a phone interview today.  
 ‘Certain Challenges’  
 “Certain challenges would be difficult to overcome though,
such as the ongoing market loss to digital,” he said. “Any
pronouncement that limits refund anticipation loans would have a
negative impact on H&R Block and an even more negative impact on
Liberty Tax.”  
 Hewitt started in the industry after taking an H&R Block
tax course in 1969, according to a statement released by Liberty
today. He advanced to regional manager before leaving to develop
his own software and his own firm, Jackson Hewitt Tax Services
Inc., in 1982. Jackson Hewitt is the second-biggest U.S. Tax
preparer behind H&R Block.  
 Hewitt left Jackson Hewitt and in 1997 founded Liberty,
which operates 3,200 branches compared with Jackson Hewitt’s
6,600 and H&R Block’s 15.2 million. In March 2009, Hewitt said
he wanted to explore a “strategic” deal with Jackson Hewitt;
no transaction took place.  
 “When I went out on my own with my dad, we went back and
tried to sell our software to Tom,” Hewitt said. “We put a bid
together for a couple of their districts in Kansas City. Maybe
they should have bought us back then.”
