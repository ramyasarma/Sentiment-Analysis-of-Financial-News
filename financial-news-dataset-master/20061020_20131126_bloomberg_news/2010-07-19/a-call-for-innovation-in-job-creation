             The Gulf oil spill looks like it  might be capped . U.S.  financial regulation  is underway, plugging holes of another kind, which won't allow sub-prime mortgage lending to gush through. A new  consumer financial protection agency  is being formed. Health reform is providing incentives for  prevention , the ultimate cost-cutting measure that can also make us healthier. Technology companies march along an innovation path that can improve devices that improve our lives, while showing strong profits. 

 All should be right with the U.S. economy. But it's not. The things that touch people's lives most directly —  good jobs  with good wages and growth prospects — remain out of reach for many.  Consumer confidence is down . Even the affluent are cutting back on purchases, reports say. Stimulus money is  running out . Though useful, the pothole-fixing strategy has its limits. Census workers will be  back to the ranks of the unemployed . Talented executives who have given up on job searches still call themselves consultants and work occasionally for a fraction of their previous salaries.  

 We can career-counsel people all we want about how to find jobs, but the true national challenge now is how to create jobs. The private sector, and particularly smaller businesses, is the ultimate engine of job creation, but even the best engine can use a tune-up and a jump-start. Here are a few ideas. 

 Partnerships for job creation . While big companies have tended to be net job-shedders, they create jobs through the small and mid-sized enterprises in their supply and distributions chains. Big can power small. Imagine a national partnership in which big companies pledge to enhance the capabilities of domestic suppliers by providing mentors, investment capital, opportunities in export markets and use of offices abroad, and even insurance benefits as part of a larger pool. This kind of strategy worked to put welfare recipients to work after the U.S. passed welfare reform; the  Welfare-to-Work Partnership  was a not-for-profit association of large companies committed to make a contribution, with White House encouragement. I've seeded this idea in a few places, and a group of prominent global companies is working out the details (still confidential) as a model for many others. 

 National service . Civilian national and community service is a win-win for education, youth development, and the economy, because service corps members, like their military counterparts, serve full time in exchange for stipends. The demand for slots in AmeriCorps programs is greater than the number of positions — and not just because other jobs are scarce. There is an upsurge of idealism on the part of young people who want to feel that they are making a difference for the health, education, and well-being of American communities. This is also pragmatic, since those who have served in  Teach for America  or  City Year  are considered more desirable by the best colleges and universities as well as coveted by employers for their life experience and leadership. Congress has authorized a significant expansion of  AmeriCorps  but has not provided full funding.  

 Encouraging early entrepreneurship . From  Junior Achievement  in high school, which gets kids thinking about a business they could start, to loan forgiveness programs for college graduates who start a business, getting more people in the entrepreneurial habit earlier in life can help jump-start jobs. Micro-finance is not the answer for everyone, and it can seem small and inefficient. But helping neighborhood businesses expand even modestly can contribute to job creation. Rather than being job-seekers, people can be encouraged to be job-creators. Stay-at-home Moms might venture away from the home for part of their time. And some of the small propositions might have the potential to be larger.   

 Finding growth companies . My friend  Tim Ferguson , co-founder of  Next Street Financial  in the Boston inner city, argues that the big gap in access to capital, especially for minorities, presents an opportunity for proven businesses to expand to the next stage — to so-called mezzanine finance. A public-private partnership fund can fill the gap. The public component can offer credibility, the stamp of approval, while the fund could attract private investors whose worries are eased by public support. Add some mentoring — perhaps through a variant of a supply chain partnership with big company customers, and then enterprises sink or swim on their own. 

 America is supposedly the land of innovation. Let's apply some of our traditional ingenuity to creating the conditions that create jobs. That is one of the best ways to secure the future.
