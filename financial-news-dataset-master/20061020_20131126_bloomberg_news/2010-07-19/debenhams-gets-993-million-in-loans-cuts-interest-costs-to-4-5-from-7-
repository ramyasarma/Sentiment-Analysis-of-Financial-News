             Debenhams Plc , the U.K.’s second-
largest department store company, obtained 650 million pounds
($993 million) of loans to extend its debt maturity by more than
three years and cut borrowing costs.  
 The forward-start facility comprises a 250 million-pound
term loan and a 400 million-pound revolving credit due in
October 2013, with an option to roll over the debt until 2014,
the London-based retailer said today in a statement. Part of the
debt will be hedged into fixed rate finance.  
 Interest costs will fall to about 4.5 percent in the first
year of the loans from 7 percent this year, the company said.
The new rate kicks in after April 2011 when existing financing
for 1.35 billion pounds expires, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Libor for three-month loans in pounds, used as a base rate
for corporate borrowing, has fallen to 0.736 percent from 4.7
percent in 2006, when Debenhams signed its previous deal,
Bloomberg data show. Libor is the London interbank offered rate.  
 Barclays Capital, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc arranged the new loan, Debenhams said.
