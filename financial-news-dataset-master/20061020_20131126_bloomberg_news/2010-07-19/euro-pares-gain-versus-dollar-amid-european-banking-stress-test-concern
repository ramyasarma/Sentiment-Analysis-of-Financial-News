             The euro pared its gain versus the
dollar amid concern that the release of European bank stress
test results this week will show the region’s lender may need
greater support.  
 “People are nervous ahead of the release of the stress
test,” said  Jessica Hoversen,  a Chicago-based analyst at the
futures broker MF Global Holdings Ltd. “European officials are
trying to mitigate fears by saying that the banks will pass, but
the market is still nervous of the amount of capital that may
need to be raised.”  
 The euro traded at $1.2944 at 8:55 a.m. in New York, after
earlier rising as high as $1.2992, from $1.2930 on July 16. It
reached $1.3008 on July 16, the strongest level since May 10.
The single currency climbed 0.7 percent versus the Japanese yen
to 112.73. The euro appreciated 0.4 percent to 84.84 U.K. pence.  
 European regulators are examining the strength of 91 banks
to determine whether they can survive potential losses on
sovereign-debt holdings. Stress-test results will be released
July 23.
