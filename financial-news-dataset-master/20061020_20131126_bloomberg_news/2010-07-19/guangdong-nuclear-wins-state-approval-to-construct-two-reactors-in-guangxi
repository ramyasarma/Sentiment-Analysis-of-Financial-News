             China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group
Co. , the nation’s second-biggest builder of atomic plants,
received state approval to construct two reactors in the
southern province of Guangxi to boost supply of clean energy.  
 The first-phase development at Fangchenggang will cost 24
billion yuan ($3.5 billion) and comprise two units with
capacities of 1,080 megawatts each, according to a statement
 published  on the website of the State-owned Assets Supervision
and Administration Commission today.  
 China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases,
wants 15 percent of its energy demand to come from clean sources
by 2020 to reduce emissions and reliance on coal and oil.
Construction of the two nuclear reactors at Fangchenggang will
start by the end of this month and be completed by 2016,
according to the statement.  
 The State Council approval was expected in the first
quarter of 2010, Zhang Yuanxin, head of Guangxi’s Development
and Reform Commission, had said in February. The local
government aimed to start the first reactor by 2014, Zhang said
then.  
 China Guangdong Nuclear will partner China Power Investment
Corp. and Guangxi Investment Group Co. to build six reactors
totaling 6,000 megawatts at the Fangchenggang site, Liu Qingming,
vice chairman of the advisory body of Fangchenggang’s government,
said in March 2007.
