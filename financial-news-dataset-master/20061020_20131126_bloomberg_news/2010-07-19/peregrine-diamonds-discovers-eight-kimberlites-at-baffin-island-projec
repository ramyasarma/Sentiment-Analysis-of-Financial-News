             Peregrine Diamonds Ltd. , which is
exploring for diamonds in the eastern Canadian Arctic with  BHP
Billiton Ltd. , said it discovered eight kimberlites at the
Chidliak project.  
 Spending on drilling and rock sampling at Chidliak on
Baffin Island will rise to C$15.3 million ($14.5 million) this
year from C$13.5 million, Vancouver-based Peregrine also said
today in a statement.  
 Chidliak, located more than 4,100 kilometers (2,648 miles)
north of Ottawa, is “the most-promising new diamond discovery
in the world,” John Kaiser, publisher of Kaiser Bottom-Fish
Online, a mining industry newsletter, wrote June 1.  
 BHP, the world’s largest mining company, is funding
exploration to earn a 51 percent stake in Chidliak. An option to
increase ownership to 58 percent will expire later this year.  
 “We have the potential for a mine already from what we’ve
discovered so far,” Peregrine President Brooke Clements said in
a July 16 interview. “We want to see if we can determine this
year that we have a BHP-size mine.”  
 Peregrine climbed 2 cents, or 1.2 percent, to C$1.71 at the
close in Toronto trading.  
 Peregrine and BHP are gathering more information by
deploying three exploration drilling rigs, compared with one
last year, when they spent C$9.2 million, Clements said.  
 Peregrine Chief Executive Officer Eric Friedland said he’s
confident further exploration will show there’s a sufficient
quantity of diamonds to justify development costs.
