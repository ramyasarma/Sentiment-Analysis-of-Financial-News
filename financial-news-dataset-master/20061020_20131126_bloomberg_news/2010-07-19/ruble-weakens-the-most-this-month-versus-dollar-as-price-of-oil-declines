             The ruble weakened the most against
the dollar this month, declining for the first day in six, as
oil, Russia’s chief export earner, slid.  
 Russia’s currency depreciated as much as 0.7 percent
against the greenback, the biggest intraday dip since June 29.
It closed down 0.5 percent at 30.5475 per dollar in Moscow, the
first daily drop since July 9. The yield on Russia’s benchmark
dollar bonds due 2015 rose 6 basis points to 4.094 percent.  
 Crude for August delivery slumped as much as 0.7 percent to
$75.50 in New York and was at $75.80 a barrel at the end of
official ruble trading in Moscow. The contract slipped 0.8
percent on July 16, after the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index for July slid to
its lowest level since August, missing economists’ estimates.  
 Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency
little changed at 30.7138 per dollar in three months compared
with an NDF of 30.7115 on July 16. The contracts are a guide to
expectations of currency movements as they allow foreign
investors and companies to fix the exchange rate at a particular
level in the future.  
 The ruble slipped 0.1 percent to 39.5350 per euro, leaving
it at 34.5919 against the central bank’s  target  currency basket,
which is used to manage swings that hurt Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
