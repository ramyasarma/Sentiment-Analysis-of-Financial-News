             Delta Air Lines Inc. , the world’s
largest carrier, fell the most in two months in New York trading
after its operating margin  forecast  missed some analysts’
estimates.  
 The third-quarter operating  margin  will be 10 percent to 12
percent, Delta said today in reporting second-quarter earnings.
That trailed estimates of 13.3 percent by  Hunter Keay , a Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. analyst, and of 13 percent by  Michael Derchin , an
analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut.  
 “This is a case where people got a little too ahead of
themselves on expectations -- their guidance was in the
ballpark, but a little light,” said Derchin, who recommends
buying the stock.  
 The outlook provided by Delta, the first major U.S. carrier
to report second-quarter results, reflects a cautious view as
last-minute business travel remains difficult to predict in the
current economy, Derchin said. Shares fell across the industry
on investor concern that other airlines may also provide
outlooks that miss analysts’ estimates, he said.  
 Delta slid 75 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $10.97 at 12:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after falling
as much as 11 percent, the steepest intraday decline since May
6.  The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index , which consists of 12
carriers, lost 5.4 percent.  
 US Airways Group Inc. , United Airlines parent UAL Corp. and
Continental Airlines Inc. all dropped more than 8 percent.  
 Capacity, Fleet  
 Delta’s second-quarter  profit  excluding some items was $549
million, or 65 cents a share, trailing the 66-cent average
projection of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue advanced 17 percent to $8.17 billion, falling short of
the $8.25 billion average of 10 analysts’ estimates.  
 A year earlier, the company posted an adjusted loss of $199
million for the second quarter.  
 Delta plans to reduce its fleet by 20 aircraft in 2011, on
top of eliminating 90 planes from the fleet this year, Chief
Executive Officer  Richard Anderson  said on a call with analysts
and investors. That includes some 50-seat regional jets with
leases that are expiring as well as Saab 340 turboprops and DC-
9s, said  Betsy Talton , a spokeswoman.  
 Delta had 966 planes as of March, and owned 673 of them
while leasing the rest.  
 Delta said total  capacity  would be unchanged or rise as
much as 2 percent in the current quarter, and advance as much as
7 percent in the final quarter of the year.  
 President  Ed Bastian  called the fourth-quarter figure an
“anomaly,” citing a higher-than-usual capacity reduction a
year earlier related to the H1N1 flu and the recession.  
 Capacity in 2011 will increase 1 percent to 3 percent,
Bastian said.
