             Petroleos Mexicanos, Latin America’s
largest oil producer, is seeking to raise its budget 54 percent
to a record next year to increase output and reserves, a board
member said.  
 Pemex, as the state-owned company is known, presented a
budget proposal of 400 billion pesos ($31 billion) for 2011 to
the Finance Ministry today, up from 260 billion earmarked for
this year,  Hector Moreira , a board member who attended a weekend
meeting to draft the plan, said today in a telephone interview.  
 Mexico, the second-largest oil supplier to the U.S., aims
to increase crude output to 3.3 million barrels a day by 2024
and may need to invest more than $25 billion a year to reach
that goal, Energy Minister  Georgina Kessel  said in an April 29
interview. The country produced 2.55 million barrels per day in
June, according to National Hydrocarbon Commission data.  
 Pemex is increasing investment in projects in southeastern
Mexico, Moreira said.  
 “That’s where we’re seeing most of the new discoveries,”
he said.  
 After approval by the Finance Ministry, the 2011 proposal
must be submitted to Congress as part of the government’s budget
plan scheduled to be voted on by Nov. 15.  
 About 80 percent of Pemex’s 2010 budget was earmarked for
exploration and production projects, according to the
commission.  
 Pemex expects the price for its crude exports to average
$61.50 per barrel next year, Moreira said. The  average price  has
dropped 6.8 percent this year to $68.46 per barrel on July 16,
according to Pemex data.
