             The cost of protecting Asian bonds
from default surged by the most in six weeks after U.S. banks
reported revenue that missed estimates, sending stocks tumbling.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of credit-default swaps on 50
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan climbed 9 basis points
to 137 basis points as of 8:23 a.m. in Singapore, the biggest
jump since June 4, prices from Credit Agricole CIB and CMA show.  
 Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. helped drag the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a 2.9 percent loss on July 16,
falling 9.2 and 6.3 percent respectively after reporting
declines in second-quarter revenue. An index of U.S. consumer
sentiment published the same day sank to the lowest since August
and less than the most pessimistic forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “The negative reaction in the stock market to U.S. bank
earnings has got the credit market worried,” said  Finbar Cooke ,
head of credit derivatives at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. in Sydney. “It’s made investors question the
strength of the economic recovery.”  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index jumped 8 basis points to
133.5 basis points as of 10:56 a.m. in Sydney, the most since
June 29, according to ANZ and CMA. Markets in Japan are closed
today for a holiday.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
