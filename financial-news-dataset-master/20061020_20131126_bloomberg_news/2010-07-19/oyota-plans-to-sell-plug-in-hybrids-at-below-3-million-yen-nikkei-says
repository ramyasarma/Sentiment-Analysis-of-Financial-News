             (Corrects to Corp. in first paragraph.)  
 Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
largest automaker, plans to sell plug-in hybrid vehicles at less
than 3 million yen ($34,500) to consumers to compete with
electric cars offered by rivals, the Sankei newspaper said,
citing an unidentified company official.  
 Toyota’s plug-in hybrids were offered to corporate clients
at 5.25 million yen each in December, while Nissan Motor Co.’s
Leaf electric car will be sold at 3.76 million yen, according to
the report.  
 “The price isn’t set yet,” said Toyota spokeswoman Mieko
Iwasaki today. Markets and businesses in Japan are closed today
for a national holiday.
