             Sanlam Ltd. said its plan to enter a
conditional subscription agreement with Principle Capital
Holdings SA has been canceled.  
 “It became apparent to both Sanlam and Principle that the
conditions for completion of the transaction would most likely
not be met by the contractual cut-off date of July 31,” Sanlam
said in an e-mailed statement today.
