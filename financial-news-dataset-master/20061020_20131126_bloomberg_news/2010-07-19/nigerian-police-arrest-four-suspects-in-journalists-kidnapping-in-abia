             Nigerian police arrested four people
suspected of involvement in the abduction of four journalists
for ransom, police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said.  
 “We have four persons in custody in respect of this
offence,” he said phone from the capital, Abuja, today. “We
are also in hot pursuit of other fleeing members of the gang and
we shall catch up with them.”  
 The four officials of the Nigerian Union of Journalists
were rescued by police from the bush yesterday, where they were
taken by abductors who seized them on July 12 in the
southeastern state of Abia.  
 An upsurge of violent attacks since 2006 against foreign
oil workers in the Niger River delta is now increasingly being
directed at other Nigerians, according to the police.  
 Unrest in the southern delta region, home to Nigeria’s oil
and gas industry, cut Nigeria’s oil output by more than 28
percent between 2006 and 2009, when thousands of militants
disarmed to accept a government amnesty offer.  
 Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. oil imports.
