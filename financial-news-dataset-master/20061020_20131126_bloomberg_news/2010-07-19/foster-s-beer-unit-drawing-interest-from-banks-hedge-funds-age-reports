             Foster’s Group Ltd. has drawn
interest from at least two investment banks conducting due
diligence on behalf of clients, which may make a potential
takeover bid for the company’s beer unit, the Age newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. A bid for
the unit may be worth between A$11 billion to A$13 billion, the
newspaper said. Hedge funds in Hong Kong and the U.S. have
increased their interest in Foster’s and are trying to work out
the timing for the proposed separation, with an arrangement
expected to be announced in February or March, the Age said.
