             Standard Chartered Plc  has expanded
the role of  Remy Klammers , its global head of fixed-income
trading, to include responsibility for running commodities
worldwide after the departure of  Vincent Van Pelt , a person
familiar with the matter said.  
 Singapore-based Klammers is now the bank’s global head of
fixed-income, currencies and commodities and he reports to  Lenny Feder , group head of financial markets, said the person, asking
not to be identified.  Van Pelt  left last month to return to the
U.K. for personal reasons.  
 Simon Brookhouse , former chief executive officer of
Execution Noble Ltd. in London, joins the bank on Aug. 2 as
global head of equities, a role also held previously by Van Pelt,
the person said. Brookhouse will be Hong Kong-based and report
to Feder. Asiamoney said July 12 that StanChart had hired
Brookhouse to run its worldwide equity business.  
 Calls today by Bloomberg News to Klammers’s office phone in
Singapore and to the press office at Execution Noble in London
weren’t answered.
