             Wheat in  South Africa  rose for a
third day as the rand weakened against the dollar, increasing
the cost of imports for local millers.  
 The rand traded at 7.6354 to the dollar at 12:14 p.m. in
Johannesburg, compared with 7.5674 at the close of grain trading
at noon on July 16.  
 Wheat for September delivery, the most active contract on
the  South African Futures Exchange , gained 23 rand, or 0.9
percent, to close trade at 2,507 rand ($327) a metric ton. The
country is the fourth-largest producer of the grain on the
continent after Egypt, Morocco and Algeria.  
 White corn for December delivery fell 1 rand, or 0.1
percent, to 1,209 rand a ton. Meal made from the grain is South
Africa’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for September delivery declined 2 rand, or 0.2
percent, to 1,207 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly for
animal feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are the
world’s largest exporters of the grain.  
 Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:
