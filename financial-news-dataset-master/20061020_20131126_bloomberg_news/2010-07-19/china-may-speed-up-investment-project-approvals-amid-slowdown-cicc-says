             China may start to discuss adjusting
policies given growing signs of an economic slowdown,
according to China International Capital Corp.  
 The government may accelerate the approval of investment
projects, reduce macro intervention in the real estate market
and loosen liquidity controls, Ha Jiming and Xing Ziqiang,
CICC’s economists, wrote in a note to clients.
