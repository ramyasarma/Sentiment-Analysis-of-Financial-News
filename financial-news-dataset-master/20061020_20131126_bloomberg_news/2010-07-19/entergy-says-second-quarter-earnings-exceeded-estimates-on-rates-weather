             Entergy Corp. , owner of the second-
largest group of U.S. nuclear power plants, said it expects to
report second-quarter profit of $1.70 a share excluding one-time
costs and gains, beating estimates.  
 Earnings were driven by more revenue from the New Orleans-
based company’s utility and nuclear units, according to a
preliminary statement released today. Warm weather and previous
rate hikes helped to increase utility sales across all customer
classes, the company said. Nuclear revenue was boosted by having
reactors operating more days.  
 The company was expected to earn $1.44 a share, according
to the average of 15  analysts ’ estimates surveyed by Bloomberg.
Entergy reported $1.23 a share profit in the same period last
year.  
 Entergy reiterated its full-year forecast for per-share
profit excluding one-time items at $6.40 to $7.20. The company
will release complete second-quarter earnings on Aug. 3.  
 Entergy  fell  $1.08, or 1.4 percent, to $75.96 on July 16.
The shares have fallen 7.2 percent since the beginning of the
year.
