             The dollar fell against the euro in
the last month as negative data surprises out of the U.S.
compared unfavorably with positive data surprises from the euro
region, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s Jim Reid.  
 “On this measure U.S. data has fallen off a cliff relative
to expectations in recent weeks,” Reid said in an e-mailed note
today. “The euro-area data hasn’t been as negative relative to
expectations. This perhaps explains the recent strength of the
euro and the change in focus from EU problems to U.S. data.”  
 U.S. economic data surprised to  the  downside since June 10,
falling to minus 33.5 last week, according to an  index  compiled 
by Citigroup Inc. Euro-region data surprised to the upside since
April 16, and was at positive 44.3, a Citigroup index shows.
