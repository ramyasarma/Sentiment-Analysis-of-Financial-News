             PKN Orlen SA , Poland’s largest oil
refiner, is looking at buying exploration and production assets
in North America and North Africa, its head of exploration said.  
 “We’re analyzing offers,”  Wieslaw Prugar  said today at
the  Global Shale Gas Summit  in Warsaw. “We’re looking at a
couple of companies that may become our acquisition target and
we’re planning to finish all analysis before the end of the
year.”  
 PKN Orlen, now mainly focused on oil refining and sales of
fuel, aims to expand into production and electricity generation
to diversify its business. It’s trying to sell non-core telecom
and chemical assets to fund an expansion and cut debt.  
 Orlen and state-controlled competitor Grupa Lotos SA import
most of the oil they process from Russia.
