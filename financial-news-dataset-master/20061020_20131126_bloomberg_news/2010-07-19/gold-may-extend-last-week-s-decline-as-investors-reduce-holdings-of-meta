             Gold, little changed in New York,
may decline after investors reduced holdings of the metal on
speculation that recent price strength was overdone.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators trimmed
their  net-long positions  in New York gold futures by 2 percent
to 204,921 contracts in the week ended July 13, according to
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That’s the
lowest since the week ended April 6. New York-traded gold
futures have lost for three weeks out of four.  
 “Price direction is probably down for this week and gold
will spend more time around the $1,180 and $1,190 levels,” said
 Robin Bhar , a metals analyst at Credit Agricole CIB in London.
“Prices looked overbought and everybody was very long gold,”
he said. A long position is typically a bet for rising prices.  
 The contract for August delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
$1,187.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange as of 8:22 a.m. The contract closed down 1.8
percent last week. Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.4 percent
to $1,187.75 an ounce in London.  
 Bullion rose to $1,190.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,189.25 at the afternoon fixing of July 16.  
 Still, prices in New York and London have gained more than
8 percent this year, heading for a 10th consecutive annual
advance. Gold may rise as investors are likely to continue
buying the metal as a hedge against currencies and other
financial markets that are hit by the European debt crisis,
Barclays Capital said in a report dated July 16.  
 Platinum, Palladium Gain  
 Prices will average $1,195 an ounce this year, 23 percent
higher than $972 an ounce last year, analysts  Suki Cooper  and
 Gayle Berry  said in the report. Their previous estimate for 2010
was $1,166.  
 Sixteen of 24 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 67 percent, said bullion will climb this week.
Three forecast lower prices and five were neutral. Prices below
$1,200 an ounce attract purchases particularly in Asia,  Mark O’Byrne , executive director of GoldCore Ltd. in Dublin, said in
a July 16 report.  
 The U.S.  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against
six counterparts, gained as much as 0.4 percent today. A weaker
dollar typically encourages purchases of gold as a hedge against
the U.S. currency.  
 Holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at 1,314.21 metric
tons on July 16, according to figures on the company’s website.  
 Silver for September delivery dropped 0.2 percent at
$17.755 an ounce and October-delivery platinum added 0.2
percent at $1,515 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery
climbed 0.9 percent to $452.50 an ounce.
