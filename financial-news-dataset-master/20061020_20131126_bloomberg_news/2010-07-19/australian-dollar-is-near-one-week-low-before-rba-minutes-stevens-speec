             The Australian dollar traded near
its lowest in more than a week before minutes of the central
bank’s July meeting, when policy makers kept interest rates
unchanged for a second month.  
 New Zealand’s dollar yesterday fell against 14 of its 16
most-traded counterparts on concern a gradual economic recovery
will allow central bank Governor  Alan Bollard  to slow the pace
of rate increases. The Reserve Bank of Australia said July 6 it
expects inflation to hold near the top of the bank’s 2 percent
to 3 percent target range over the next year. The statistics
bureau will report on consumer prices on July 28.  
 “The board minutes might provide more clues on how high
the hurdle is for consumer-price inflation to trigger a rate
hike given the risks around the central bank’s growth
forecast,” said  John Kyriakopoulos , head of currency strategy
at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “The Australian
dollar will continue to be buffeted by swings in stock prices as
a barometer of sentiment towards global growth prospects.”  
 Australia’s currency traded at 86.87 U.S. cents as of 10:07
a.m. in Sydney from 86.84 cents in New York yesterday, when it
reached as low as 86.34 cents, the least since July 8. The
currency rose to 75.40 yen from 75.28.  
 New Zealand’s dollar bought 70.57 U.S. cents from 70.60
cents and traded at 61.26 yen from 61.20 yen.  
 Australia’s S&P/ASX 200  Index  rose 0.3 percent, gaining for
the first time in four days.  
 ‘Data Watch’  
 RBA policy makers signaled earlier this month that monetary
policy was “appropriate,” pending further information on
demand and prices. Consumer prices rose 2.9 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the most since late 2008.  
 The RBA minutes may “simply reiterate the bank’s ‘data
watch’ stance ahead of the key inflation reading,”  Matthew Strauss , a senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
Toronto, wrote in a note to clients. “Rallies toward 87.20
cents lack conviction in the absence of a strong positive risk
theme and ahead of the RBA minutes.”  
 Central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  will speak on the
consequences of the financial crisis later today in Sydney.  
 Benchmark interest rates are 4.5 percent in  Australia  and
2.75 percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in  Japan 
and as low as zero in the U.S., attracting investors to the
South Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such
trades is that currency market moves will erase profits.  
 Australian bond futures fell, with the 10-year contract for
September delivery at 94.83 on the Sydney Futures Exchange from
94.885 yesterday. The implied yield on the futures stood at 5.17
percent. The implied yield on three-year futures was 4.69
percent. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made
to receive floating rates, was little changed at 4.17 percent.
