             BlackRock Inc. , the world’s biggest
asset manager, sold  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  shares last quarter
from its Latin America funds after Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company said it may sell $25 billion in stock.  
 “We reduced it further in the second quarter,”  William Landers , who oversees about $8 billion in Latin American stocks
at BlackRock, said in a telephone interview today from New York.
“We’re not in a hurry to make that up at this point until we
get better definition about the transaction.”  
 Landers’s $6.3 billion Latin America Fund, which returned
121 percent last year, owned 16.7 million Petrobras shares at
the end of May, making the stock its fourth-biggest holding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock accounted for
8.3 percent of assets in the fund, which has lost 6 percent in
2010.  
 Petrobras delayed its planned capital increase to September
from this month, saying on June 22 that a price hasn’t been set
in a related deal to buy oil reserves from the government. The
value of the oil will determine the size of the share sale,
potentially the biggest in the Western Hemisphere since at least
1999.  
 “It’s putting a ceiling on the shares and, given the size
of Petrobras, it’s not helpful for the market overall,” Landers
said.  
 Petrobras, down 26 percent in Sao Paulo trading this year,
plans to use money raised in the sale to help fund $224 billion
of investment through 2014. The Bovespa stock index has dropped
7.8 percent in 2010.  
 Brazil Still Cheapest  
 Brazil remains the cheapest market in the region relative
to earnings prospects, said Landers. Banks and consumer stocks
“still look good,” he said, citing the nation’s increasing
domestic demand.  
 “My contention’s been that rates aren’t going to go up as
high as the market’s been expecting,” Landers said. “They’ll
stay out of the teens in terms of the peak and that’s going to
be positive for consumer confidence.”  
 Brazil’s central bank will raise borrowing costs by three-
quarters of a percentage point to 11 percent at the conclusion
of a two-day policy meeting on July 21, according to all 31
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Bovespa  index trades for
11.8 times analysts’ 2010 earnings estimates, compared with 11.6
times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing
nations’ stocks and 15.3 times for Mexico’s IPC index, according
to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.
