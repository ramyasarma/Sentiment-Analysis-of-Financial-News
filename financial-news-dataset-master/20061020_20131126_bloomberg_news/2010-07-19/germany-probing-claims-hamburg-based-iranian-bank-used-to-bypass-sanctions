             German authorities are looking into
newspaper allegations that a Hamburg-based bank may have
breached international sanctions against Iran, the government
said.  
 The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran may be using the
European-Iranian Trade Bank AG to conduct business on behalf of
the Tehran government, even as United Nations sanctions are in
place against Iran over its refusal to halt its nuclear program.  
 “So far we have no knowledge of these violations, but
Bafin and the Bundesbank are examining accusations against this
bank,” German Finance Ministry spokesman Michael Offer told
reporters in Berlin today, referring to Germany’s financial
regulator and the central bank.  
 The European Union is currently negotiating the
implementation of “further restrictive measures on the basis of
the UN Security Council resolution,” government spokesman
Christoph Steegmans told the same briefing. “These negotiations
aren’t yet complete, however we are confident that the
conclusion will entail a strong political signal to the Iranian
regime.”  
 The banking sector is included in such measures, the
govenrment said.
