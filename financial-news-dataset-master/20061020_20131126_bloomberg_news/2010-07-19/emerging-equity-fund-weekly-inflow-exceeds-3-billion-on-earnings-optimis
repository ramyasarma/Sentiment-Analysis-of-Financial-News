             Emerging-market equity fund inflows
jumped to more than $3 billion in the week to July 14 as the
start of the U.S. earnings season prompted a rebound in optimism,
according to EPFR Global.  
 Indian equity funds absorbed $114 million, a 13-week high,
as forecasts for monsoon rainfall improved, while Brazilian
stock funds attracted $97 million, the most in 20 weeks, EPFR
said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “Cautious optimism that the prospects for a double-dip
recession have been overblown, allied to some decent early
second-quarter 2010 earnings reports” helped to bolster equity
markets and fund flows,  EPFR  said.  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  rose 0.1 percent to 945.54
as of 9:23 a.m. in Singapore, its first gain on four days. A
“double-dip” recession appears unlikely and U.S. stocks have
the potential to climb higher in the second half of the year,
 Robert Doll , vice chairman of BlackRock Inc., the world’s
largest asset manager, said today.  
 Microsoft Corp.  climbed 1.4 percent yesterday after UBS AG
raised its earnings estimate, citing signs of stronger demand.
Halliburton Co. jumped 6 percent after topping analysts’
earnings and revenue estimates.  
 Flows into global emerging market stock funds rose to their
highest level since the third week of October and those
investing in Asia excluding Japan enjoyed a “solid week,” EPFR
said. Global-tracked bond funds attracted $6.45 billion, the
most since the last week of April, it said.  
 Latin America  
 Latin America equity funds were bolstered by renewed
optimism about growth prospects in the U.S. and China, which
helped lure $97 million to Brazil equity funds, EPFR said.
That’s a 20-week high and ended 13 weeks of outflows, it said.  
 With another week of net inflows, the combined Frontier
Market Equity Funds have almost reached the $1 billion market
this year, it said. The amount is “well beyond” previous full-
year inflows.  
 Emerging-market bond funds also took in $745 million, it
said. They have absorbed a record $18.5 billion so far this year,
reflecting renewed appetite among investors for hard currency
debt, it said.
