             U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said Pakistan will have to address international
concerns before it gets approval for a deal to acquire two
nuclear reactors from China.  
 The Obama administration has asked China to explain an
agreement to build two new 650-megawatt reactors in
Pakistan’s Punjab province. China is a member of the
 Nuclear Suppliers Group , which forbids exports to nations
lacking strict International Atomic Energy Agency
safeguards.  
 Speaking at a public event in Islamabad, Clinton was
asked why the U.S. provides nuclear technology to India and
not Pakistan. The question prompted loud applause.
Clinton’s answer touched on Pakistani nuclear scientist
Abdul Qadeer Khan, who confessed in 2004 to selling nuclear
technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya.  
 “We are beginning the kind of intensive discussions
that are necessary” to evaluate Pakistan’s request,
Clinton said, discussions that the U.S. carried on for many
years with India. In Pakistan’s case “there are certain
issues that have to be addressed. They cannot be overlooked
or put behind the carpet.”  
 The NSG, which recently met to examine the reactor
sale, has posed a series of questions to Pakistan that
should be answered, Clinton said. “As part of any kind of
transaction involving nuclear power, there are concerns by
the international community, Pakistan knows that,” Clinton
said.  
 Export Controls  
 Clinton said worries exist over Pakistan’s export
controls and because Pakistan is alone in raising
objections to the fissile material cutoff treaty, being
pursued by the United Nations  Conference on Disarmament ,
which would prohibit the production of plutonium and highly
enriched uranium for nuclear weapons purposes.  
 “The only country,” Clinton repeated. “So people
say, why? Why is Pakistan the only country not agreeing?”  
 Clinton said that Khan’s nuclear exports raise “a red
flag for people around the world, and not just in the
U.S.A., because we can trace the export of nuclear
information and material from Pakistan through all kinds of
channels to many different countries. That is an issue.”
