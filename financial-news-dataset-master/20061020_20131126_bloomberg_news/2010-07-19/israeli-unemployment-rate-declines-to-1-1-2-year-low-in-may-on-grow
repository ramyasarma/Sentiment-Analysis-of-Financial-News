             Israel’s  unemployment rate  fell to a
1 1/2-year low in May as the economy expanded.  
 The jobless rate declined to 6.5 percent from 6.6 percent
in the previous month, the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of
Statistics said today on its website. Last May, unemployment was
7.8 percent.  
 “The labor market is still reacting to the strong growth
in the last quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010,”
 Ori Greenfeld , a macro-economist at Tel Aviv-based Psagot
Investment House Ltd., said before the announcement.  
 Israel’s economy  expanded an annualized 3.4 percent in the
first quarter, led by private consumption and exports after
growing 4.4 percent in the previous three months. The economic
recovery began in the second quarter of last year when gross
domestic product expanded a revised 1.3 percent.  
 Unemployment is likely to drop to 7.3 percent this year,
from 7.6 percent in 2009, the Finance Ministry said in a June 6
forecast. Next year, unemployment is likely to decline to 6.8
percent, the ministry said.  
 Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 stock index  surged about 23
percent in the past 12 months, led by Perrigo Co., the world’s
largest maker of non-prescription, store-branded drugs, which
more than doubled.
