             Galileo Group may win the A$450
million Chatswood residential project in Sydney after Meriton
dropped its bid for the venture, the Australian Financial Review
reported, without saying where it got the information. Meriton’s
initial bid was rejected because of conditions placed on the
offer, the newspaper said.
