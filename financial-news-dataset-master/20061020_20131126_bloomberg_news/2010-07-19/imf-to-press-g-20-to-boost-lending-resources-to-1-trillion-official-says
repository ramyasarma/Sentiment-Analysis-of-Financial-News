             The International Monetary Fund is
seeking a boost in its lending capacity to $1 trillion, from the
current $750 billion, at a Group of 20 summit in South Korea in
November, according to a Korean government official.  
 The increase would help strengthen a global financial
safety net to counter crises, the official said on condition of
anonymity because the talks are private. South Korea is chair of
the G-20 this year. IMF Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn 
told the Financial Times that a boost to $1 trillion in IMF
lending firepower was a “correct forecast.”  
 Strauss-Kahn has sought to enhance the IMF’s role in
serving as a buttress against financial crises, already
overseeing a trebling in the fund’s war-chest to $750 billion
since early 2009. While the IMF doesn’t foresee the global
economy sinking back into a recession, the European debt crisis
and elevated U.S.  unemployment  threaten to curtail the recovery.  
 “They will have to increase the lending capacity over time
to contain a crisis more effectively,” said  Ham Joon-Ho , a
professor of international economics and finance at Yonsei
University in Seoul. Ham added that the IMF will also need to
work to encourage members to line up contingency financing with
the fund, which most have steered clear of given concern such a
step would carry the “stigma” of signaling financial trouble.  
 Economic Turmoil  
 South Korea, which successfully resuscitated its economy
and banking system after the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, has
led efforts within the G-20 to adopt additional measures to
combat financial and economic turmoil. The IMF discussions are
in the context of talks to increase the so-called  quotas  that
members of the Washington-based lender contribute.  
 “We’ll come to an agreement by the November G-20 summit in
Seoul on the capital increase of the IMF,”  William Murray , a
spokesman for the fund in Washington, said by telephone.  
 Choi Hee Nam, a director general on a South Korean
presidential committee, said today that his nation is willing to
increase its quota as part of contributing to global economic
and financial stability.  
 Group of 20 leaders at a Toronto summit called on June 27
for quota reforms to be completed by the summit in Seoul in
November. Changes are partly intended to give developing nations
a stronger voice.
