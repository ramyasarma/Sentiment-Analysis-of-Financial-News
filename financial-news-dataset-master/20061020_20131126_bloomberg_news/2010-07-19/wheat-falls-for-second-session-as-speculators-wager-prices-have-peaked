             Wheat fell for a second straight
session on sales by speculative investors after prices reached a
seven-month high.  
 Since June 9, the eve of wheat’s latest rally, the most-
active contract has gained 36 percent, jumping last week to the
highest level since Nov. 23, as adverse weather curbed output.
Investors who had bet on a run-up may have sold because the high
prices aren’t justified by fundamentals, said  William Bayer , a
partner at PTI Securities in Chicago.  
 “If I were long wheat, or if I bought it on the way up, I
would be getting nervous,” Bayer said. “I suspect we’re going
to see some profit-taking in corn and beans, and that’s going to
spill over into the wheat market.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $5.8225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Though dry weather in Russia and wet weather in Canada threaten
production, global stockpiles are expected to be the highest
since 2002, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  
 Ukraine’s hot weather, forecast for two more weeks, won’t
harm plants that are ready to be harvested, the country’s
Hydrometeorology Center said today. The center forecasts grain
production at 42.5 million to 43.5 million tons.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
