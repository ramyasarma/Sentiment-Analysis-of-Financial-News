             Office rents in London’s West End
district, the world’s most expensive location in which to lease
space, climbed for the first time in three years as hedge funds
competed for a shrinking amount of available space in Mayfair,
 Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  said.  
 Annual rents for the best offices climbed to 85 pounds
($130) a square foot in the second quarter from 75 pounds in the
previous three months, according to a study compiled by the
Chicago property broker’s London-based researchers.  
 “We have witnessed a real sea change in the West End over
the past couple of months,” said Jonathan Evans, head of Jones
Lang’s  West End leasing and development agency . Prime office
rents will rise to 87.50 pounds a foot by the end of the year,
he predicted.  
 The credit crisis halted most new developments, leaving
prospective tenants with limited choices for prime office space
in the district, which is London’s main hub for restaurants,
theaters and stores. The amount of space available to lease in
the West End fell by 3 percent in the second quarter to 6.2
million square feet, Jones Lang estimates.  
 Top rents are concentrated on the neighborhoods of Mayfair
and St. James’s, which are favored by hedge funds and buyout
firms because of their proximity to prospective private banking
clients. The area is also close to the high-end residential
neighborhoods to the west and southwest.  
 Average prime rents peaked at a record 115 pounds a foot in
the second quarter of 2008 as financial-services firms competed
for the best space. The credit crisis caused rents to slump by
half, if incentives such as rent-free periods offered by
landlords are included.  
 Savile Row  
 Hedge funds accounted for two of the biggest deals in the
second quarter, the broker said. Eton Park Capital Management LP
leased space on Savile Row in Mayfair for 85 pounds a foot and
Park Square Capital LLP agreed to pay 82.50 pounds a foot for
offices on nearby Stratton Street.  
 The supply shortage and prospects of higher rents have
persuaded developers, including British Land Co.,  Great Portland
Estates Plc  and Land Securities Group Plc, to revive development
projects before lining up tenants for the space.
