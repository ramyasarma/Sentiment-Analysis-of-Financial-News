             The Europaeisch-Iranische
Handelsbank AG said it “strictly fulfills all prevailing
mandatory legal rules and export regulations,” and “obeys all
sanction regulations” applying in Germany and the European
Community.  
 The bank commented in an e-mailed statement today, in
response to a Wall Street Journal report that Iran may be using
the bank to conduct business on behalf of the Tehran government,
even as United Nations sanctions are in place against Iran over
its refusal to halt its nuclear program.
