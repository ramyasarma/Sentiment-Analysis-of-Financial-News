             India’s rupee fell the most in a
month on concern investors will cut holdings of emerging-market
assets after the latest reports on U.S. consumer confidence and
inflation signaled the global economic recovery is faltering.  
 The currency weakened for a second day after a loss of 1
percent in the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan  Index  of
regional shares. A gauge of consumer sentiment slumped to an 11-
month low and consumer prices held at a 44-year low in the
world’s largest economy, separate reports from the U.S. showed
on July 16. The rupee also declined on speculation local
importers will buy dollars to settle month-end bills.  
 “Concern still lingers about the sustainability of global
economic growth and that’s fueling some risk aversion among
investors,” said  Sanjay Arya , treasurer at state-owned Bank of
Maharashtra in Mumbai. “A pick-up in dollar demand from
importers before the end of the month also may put pressure on
the rupee.”  
 The rupee retreated 0.7 percent, the most since June 22, to
47.1175 per dollar as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 47.1325 earlier, the
weakest level since July 7. The currency may trade between 46.75
and 47.35 in the coming days, Arya predicted.  
 Offshore forward contracts indicated the rupee will trade
at 47.72 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations for a rate of 47.35 at the end of last week.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  
 The currency also slipped on concern demand for the
nation’s  exports  will decline as the global economy cools.  
 Overseas sales in June rose 30.4 percent to $17.75 billion,
Commerce Secretary  Rahul Khullar  said in New Delhi today.
Exports grew 35 percent in May, 36 percent in April and 54
percent in March, government data show.
