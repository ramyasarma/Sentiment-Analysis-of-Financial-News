             An oil spill caused by an explosion
in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian has
“seriously” polluted 11 square kilometers of sea and
“slightly” affected 50 square kilometers of water, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing Wu Guogong, deputy
chief of the municipal environmental protection bureau.  
 An oil pipeline exploded late on July 16 near Dalian’s
Xingang Harbor, causing a smaller pipeline nearby to also
explode, Xinhua reported. The fire was mostly extinguished by
July 17, 15 hours after the initial explosion, Xinhua reported.  
 An investigation team has been established to examine the
explosion, Xinhua reported, citing Sun Benqiang, deputy chief of
the municipal work safety bureau.
