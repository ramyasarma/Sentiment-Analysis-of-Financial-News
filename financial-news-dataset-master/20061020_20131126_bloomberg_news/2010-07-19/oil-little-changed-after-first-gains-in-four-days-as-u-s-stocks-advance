             Crude oil rose for a second day in
New York on optimism that China’s expanding economy and a
forecast that U.S. crude supplies declined last week will show
signs of improving fuel demand.  
 Oil gained as China’s stocks advanced for a second day as
rising domestic consumption boosted the earnings of automakers.
U.S. crude inventories  probably dropped  in the seven days ended
July 16, the fourth consecutive week of declines, a Bloomberg
News survey showed before a Department of Energy report tomorrow.  
 “China’s upside really is its restocking ability and its
underlying economic growth, I can’t see too much weakness in
that market,” said  Mark Pervan , a senior commodity strategist
at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne.  
 Crude oil for August delivery gained as much as 49 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $77.03 a barrel in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $76.98 at 3:07 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, it rose 53 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$76.54. The August contract expires today.  
 The more-active September contract increased 45 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $77.35 a barrel. Futures have declined 3.1
percent this year.  
 The dollar was at $1.3001 per euro at 3:03 p.m. Singapore
time from $1.2942 in New York yesterday. A weaker dollar
increases the investment appeal of commodities like oil. The
Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China’s
stock exchanges, rose 43.85, or 1.8 percent, to 2,519.28 as of
1:19 p.m. local time, set for the highest since June 28.  
 U.S. Inventories  
 U.S. crude oil supplies probably fell 1 million barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News before an Energy Department report.
 Gasoline inventories  probably increased 1 million barrels.  
 Refineries  probably operated  at 90.15 percent of capacity
last week, down 0.35 percentage point from the previous week,
according to the Bloomberg News survey. Utilization rates in the
week ended July 9 were at the highest level since January 2008.  
 “Oil is certainly looking more bullish than bearish,”
said  Peter McGuire , managing director of CWA Global Markets Pty
in Sydney. “We still think it has upward traction from here.
Traditionally, there is more demand this time of the year.”  
 Prices gained after the Dow Jones Industrial Average
advanced 0.6 percent and Halliburton Co.’s profit beat estimates.  
 “The price of oil received a bit of a boost from a small
rally in the Dow Jones,” said  Mike Sander , an investment
adviser at Sander Capital Advisors in Seattle.  
 China  
 China  overtook the U.S. as the world’s biggest energy user
last year, suggesting continued strength in global fuel-demand
growth, according to the International Energy Agency.  
 It consumed 2,252 million metric tons of oil equivalent in
2009 in the form of oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear power and
renewable sources, IEA Chief Economist  Fatih Birol  said
yesterday. That exceeded the 2,170 million tons used by the U.S.  
 “Most of the catch-up to the U.S. is in coal demand,”
said ANZ’s Pervan. “But oil imports are still strong. China
will continue to build strategic reserves of oil, which will be
an ongoing process in the next three to four years.”  
 Brent crude oil for September settlement gained as much as
39 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $76.01 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange, and was at $75.93 at 3:05 p.m.
Singapore time. It climbed 0.3 percent to $75.62 yesterday.  
 Crude oil may fall below $70 a barrel in New York,
reversing two months of gains, unless the market can post a
“strong day” to kick off a rally, according to Cameron Hanover
Inc.  
 Oil hasn’t posted gains or losses of more than 1 percent in
the past week as swings in equities fanned concern that the
market can’t sustain its gains. Prices face technical resistance
at the 200-day moving average above $77 a barrel, based on a
chart from the energy adviser in New Canaan, Connecticut.
