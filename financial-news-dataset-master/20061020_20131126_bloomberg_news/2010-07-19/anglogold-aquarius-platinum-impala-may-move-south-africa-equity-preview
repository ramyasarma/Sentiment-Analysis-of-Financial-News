             The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in  South Africa .
Stock symbols are in parentheses after company names and prices
are from the last close.  
 South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  rose for a
second day, adding 55.15, or 0.2 percent, to 27,529.83 in
Johannesburg, its highest level since June 23.  
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ): Gold futures fell the most
in two weeks as the euro’s rebound reduced demand for the
precious metal as a haven against European-debt concerns.
AngloGold fell 1.36 rand, or 0.4 percent, to 309.64 rand.  
 Aquarius Platinum Ltd.  (AQP SJ): The metals producer will
today appeal a directive from South Africa’s government to limit
mining by reducing the size of mineable rock panels and leaving
bigger support pillars behind to improve safety. The directive
will have a “detrimental economic effect” on mines that use
the bord and pillar mining method, it said. Aquarius fell 1.22
rand, or 3.5 percent, to 34 rand.  
 FirstRand Ltd.  (FSR SJ): Fitch Ratings changed its outlook
on FirstRand Ltd.’s bank unit to “stable” from “negative” as
earnings at South Africa’s second-largest financial services
company stabilize. FirstRand gained 26 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
19.80 rand.  
 Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.  (IMP SJ): The world’s second-
largest producer of the metal meets its largest union to start
third-party mediation about a pay dispute, seeking to prevent a
repeat of a strike that halted its biggest mine for two weeks
last year. Impala fell 2.75 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 185 rand.
