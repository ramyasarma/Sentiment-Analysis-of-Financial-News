             Charles Schwab Corp. , the largest
independent brokerage by client assets, increased the size of
its planned sale of 10-year senior notes by $100 million to $600
million, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  
 The debt may yield 150 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set. San Francisco-based Charles
Schwab may sell the notes as soon as today, the person said.  
 Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, the
person said. Charles Schwab is graded A2 by Moody’s Investors
Service and an equivalent A by Standard & Poor’s.  
 The company last sold debt in June 2009, when it issued
$750 million of five-year, 4.95 percent notes that priced to
yield 250 basis points more than benchmarks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The 2015 notes rose 0.47 cent on July 16 to 109.36 cents on
the dollar to yield 2.4 percent, or 71 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  
 A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
