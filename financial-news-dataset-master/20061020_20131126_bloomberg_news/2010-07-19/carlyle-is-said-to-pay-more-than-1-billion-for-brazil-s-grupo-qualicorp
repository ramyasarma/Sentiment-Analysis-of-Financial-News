             Carlyle Group agreed to buy a
controlling stake in Brazilian health-care company Grupo
Qualicorp in a deal valued at $1.2 billion, according to a
person familiar with the transaction.  
 The purchase, announced in an e-mailed statement today, is
the third transaction in four days for Washington-based Carlyle,
the most acquisitive buyout firm this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Carlyle last week said it would buy NBTY Inc. for $3.8
billion in the biggest buyout this year, and today agreed to
acquire Australia’s  Healthscope Ltd.  for A$2 billion ($1.7
billion), in a joint transaction with TPG Capital. The pace of
deals is accelerating as funds race to put an estimated $500
billion in capital commitments to work after financial markets
recovered, according to London-based researcher Preqin Ltd.  
 “Brazil’s stability, growth and credibility in the global
economy make it a particularly attractive place to invest now,”
 Stephen Wise , managing director at Carlyle, said in the
statement. “Qualicorp sits at the nexus of the growing middle
class and consumer desire for high-quality, low-cost
healthcare.”  
 Qualicorp offers brokerage, consulting services and
management of private health insurance plans in Brazil. Founded
in 1997, the company has about 1,200 employees and represents
about 2.8 million beneficiaries as of June 2010.  
 Buyouts Rebound  
 Minority shareholder General Atlantic LLC will sell all of
its shares in Qualicorp to Carlyle. The transaction is scheduled
to be completed in August, subject to regulatory approval.  
 The $1.2 billion purchase price includes debt and equity,
which will be financed by the $13.7 billion Carlyle Partners V
and the firm’s South America buyout fund.  
 Buyouts have increased fivefold to $40.5 billion since the
start of the year. Carlyle beat rivals including Blackstone
Group LP and TPG to the NBTY deal and won Healthscope over a
rival bid from KKR & Co., according to people briefed on the
transactions.
