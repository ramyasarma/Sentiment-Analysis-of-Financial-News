             The International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, part of the World Bank, is
seeking to price a sale of kauri bonds to yield about 20 basis
points more than the mid-swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the transaction.  
 The Washington-based lender is adding to an existing line
of the 5.375 percent, New Zealand-dollar-denominated notes due
December 2014, according to an e-mailed statement from Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. earlier today.
