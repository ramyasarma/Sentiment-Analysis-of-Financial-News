             Mining companies in South Africa
will meet the Department of Mineral Resources later today to
seek more information over a government safety directive
announced last week.  
 The meeting will seek “further clarification” about the
directive, which may cut the amount of mineable reserves
companies are able to access, Xstrata Plc spokesman Songezo Zibi
said by phone from Johannesburg today.
