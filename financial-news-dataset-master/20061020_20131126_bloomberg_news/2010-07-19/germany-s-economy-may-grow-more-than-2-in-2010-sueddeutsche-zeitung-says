             Germany’s economy, Europe’s largest,
may grow more than 2 percent this year, faster than the
government’s estimate of 1.4 percent, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, citing unidentified official sources.  
 Industrial and construction orders point to faster economic
growth, while global risks remain for exports, Germany’s main
driver of economic expansion, the newspaper said, citing an
Economy Ministry monthly report due for release today. The
report does not refer to a new official economic forecast, the
newspaper said.
