             Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  set up a body charged with simplifying taxes for
thousands of companies and individuals in a bid to attract
investors to the U.K. and stimulate economic growth.  
 The panel, led  John Whiting  of the Chartered Institute of
Taxation and former Treasury minister  Michael Jack , will
identify areas in tax law that need simplification and consult
with companies, lawyers and accountants on how to make the rules
less complex. They will be assisted by a small secretariat and
neither will draw a salary.  
 The coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats forged
after the May 6 general election says the previous Labour
government expanded the U.K.’s tax code to 11,000 pages and
introduced more than 400 tax breaks. The panel will challenge
Osborne, who remains in charge of taxation, to keep the rules
simple.  
 “There is a spaghetti bowl of reliefs, exemptions and
allowances and I want create a simpler tax code,” Osborne said
at a news conference in London today. “It is a distant dream
that one day people might actually understand the laws they have
been asked to comply with.”  
 The Institute of Directors, a business lobby group, said
the British tax code “is among the most complex in the world,
and it has been getting worse every year” and that the new body
will only succeed “if it has teeth.” It said ministers should
be forced to respond to all of the panel’s recommendations.  
 Treasury minister  David Gauke  said at the same news
conference that the office “will provide important advice that
will help inform us in making the right reforms to the tax
system.”
