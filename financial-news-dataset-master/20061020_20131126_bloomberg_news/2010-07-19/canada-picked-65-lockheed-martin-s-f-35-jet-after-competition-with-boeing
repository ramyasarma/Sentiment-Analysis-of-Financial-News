             Canada picked Lockheed Martin Corp’s
F-35 fighter jet following a competition with Boeing Co.,
Industry Minister Tony Clement said in an interview at the
Farnborough Air Show today.  
 Canada is poised to get 65 F-35s at a “marginal cost,”
and the price will be lower than what the U.S. military pays for
the jets, Clement said. The total value of the order is about $9
billion.
