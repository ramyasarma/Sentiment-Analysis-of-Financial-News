             Corn prices tumbled the most in
seven weeks and soybeans fell after weekend rains revived crops
in the southern U.S. and widespread precipitation in the next
five days in the Midwest may replenish soil moisture.  
 Some fields in the Midwest and South got as much as 1.75
inches (4.4 centimeters) of rain during the weekend with most
areas likely to receive 1.25 inches to 2.5 inches this week,
said  Mike Tannura , the president of T-Storm Weather LLC in
Chicago. No sustained heat is expected in the next two weeks,
reducing the risk of stress on crops, Tannura said.  
 “The market is taking out the weather premium after
weekend rains boosted crops in areas that had been dry,” said
 Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago. “Forecasts this week are wetter and a
bit cooler than expected.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 12.25 cents, or 3
percent, to $3.95 a bushel at 10:21 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. A close at that price would mark the largest drop for a
most-active contract since May 28.  
 On July 15, corn jumped to a six-month high of $4.10. The
government said June 30 that U.S. farmers planted less this year
than they had planned.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 13 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $9.72 a bushel. A close at that price would mark the
biggest decline since June 23. Before today, the oilseed gained
9.1 percent this month.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show. The U.S. is the biggest producer and exporter of both
crops.
