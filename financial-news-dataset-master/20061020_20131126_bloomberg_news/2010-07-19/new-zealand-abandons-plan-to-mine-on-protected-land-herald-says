             New Zealand has abandoned plans to
search for minerals on some of the nation’s high-value
conservation land, the New Zealand Herald reported without
saying where it got the information.  
 In March, the government said about 7,058 hectares of land
currently protected from exploration had potential mineral
reserves and it planned to remove the protection. Today it will
announce that the land will stay classified, the newspaper said.
