             Nyrstar NV , the world’s largest zinc
producer, bought two mines in Peru for about $39 million
including debt, its second purchase in the country to obtain raw
materials for its smelters.  
 Nyrstar plans to triple annual output at the Contonga and
Pucarrajo mines to 40,000 metric tons of zinc by the end of
2012, the Balen, Belgium-based company said today in a
statement. Operations at Pucarrajo, north of Lima, have been
suspended since June 2009.  
 Buying idled mines and ramping up output will give Nyrstar,
owner of  six smelters  on three continents, a larger share of the
revenue generated by turning ore into finished metal. The
Peruvian mines will raise Nyrstar’s zinc production capacity
from its own resources to about 25 percent of the total from 21
percent, at an estimated cost of less than $1,000 a ton after
discounting revenue from their silver, lead and copper deposits.  
 “The newly acquired mines are very competitive on the cost
curve thanks to strong by-products credits,”  Wouter Vanderhaeghen , an analyst at KBC Securities NV in Brussels,
wrote in a note. “Nyrstar will also be able to realize some
synergies with its existing operations in Peru.”  
 Mines Management  
 Nyrstar, which in the past year spent $19.4 million buying
the idled Coricancha mine, east of Lima, from  Gold Hawk
Resources Inc. , said today that a single management team will
lead operations at all its Peruvian mines. Coricancha resumed
output of gold ore on June 12, according to a presentation
posted on Nyrstar’s  website .  
 Nyrstar was unchanged at 8.49 euros at the close of trade
on Euronext Brussels today, valuing the zinc producer at 849
million euros ($1.1 billion). The shares have risen 1.8 percent
this year.  
 Zinc for delivery in three months advanced 0.5 percent to
$1,806 a ton on the London Metal Exchange. The metal, which is
used to protect steel from corrosion, has averaged $2,151 so far
this year.  
 Smelters are getting an estimated 36 percent of zinc
revenue this year, down from 42 percent in 2009, based on the
fees that mining companies agreed to pay to have their semi-
processed ore turned into finished metal, Nyrstar said in April.  
 Nyrstar said it would get an ore-treatment fee of $250 a
ton this year, based on a zinc price of $2,000 a ton. Smelters
are paid an extra 5 cents for every dollar the market moves
above that price and 9 cents for every dollar above $2,500 a
ton. For every dollar drop, smelters receive 6 cents less.
