             Crude oil snapped three days of
losses as gains in U.S. index futures pointed to an equity
market rebound that may restore confidence in the outlook for
fuel demand.  
 Oil fell earlier as China said export growth may slow
during the rest of the year to less than half the pace of the
first six months, while concerns persisted about Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis. U.S. index futures rose, indicating the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may rebound from its biggest sell-
off this month.  
 “The fear of a double-dip in the U.S. and a slowdown in
China in the second half will remain the driving factors,” said
 Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. “Much will depend on the technical picture and
whether $75 holds.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery traded for $76.03, up 2
cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:25 p.m. London
time, after falling as low as $75.50. Futures have declined 4.2
percent this year. Brent crude oil for September settlement
traded for $75.38, 1 cent higher on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  
 Brent prices for longer-term settlement regained their
premium over front-month supplies after the expiration of the
August contract last week. October Brent is 41 cents higher than
September, the second day the earliest month contract is cheaper
than the subsequent, a situation known as contango.
