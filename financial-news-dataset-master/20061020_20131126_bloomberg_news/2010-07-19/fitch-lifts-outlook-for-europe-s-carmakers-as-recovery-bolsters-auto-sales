             Fitch Ratings lifted the outlooks
for  Peugeot SA , Renault SA, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG as the
recovering economy lifts global auto sales.  
 The ratings agency raised Daimler’s outlook to “positive”
from “negative,” VW’s to “positive” from “stable” and
Peugeot and  Renault ’s to “stable” from “negative,” Fitch
said in a statement today. Fiat’s outlook remains “negative,”
it said.  
 The changes reflect an improvement in carmakers’
“financial profiles since 2009, the faster-than-anticipated
recovery in global auto sales and Fitch’s revised expectations
for key credit metrics in the next couple of years,”  Emmanuel Bulle , a Fitch senior director, said in the statement.  
 Daimler  and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the world’s
biggest makers of luxury cars, raised their forecasts for 2010
last week after new vehicles helped boost sales in China and the
U.S. Carmakers are expanding in China, the world’s largest
automobile market, as demand surges.  
 China’s market will grow 20 percent this year, Fitch said,
reaffirming the current ratings on the carmakers.
