             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  fell for the first day in three, dropping 200.08, or
0.7 percent, to 27,329.75 in Johannesburg, its biggest drop in
more than three weeks. The measure has declined 1.2 percent this
year.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), Africa’s biggest gold
producer, dropped 7.64 rand, or 2.5 percent, to 302 rand, its
lowest price since April 26. The price of gold slumped as much
as 1.3 percent to $1,177.47 an ounce on the London Metal
Exchange.  Gold Fields Ltd.  (GFI SJ) declined 3.52 rand, or 3.5
percent, to 96 rand, its lowest price in nearly three months.  
 Aquarius Platinum Ltd.  (AQP SJ), the metals producer,
retreated 8 rand, or 23.5 percent, to 26 rand, the biggest drop
since at least December 2004. Aquarius will appeal a directive
from South Africa’s government to limit mining by reducing the
size of mineable rock panels and leaving bigger support pillars
behind to improve safety.  Anglo Platinum Ltd.  (AMS SJ), which
will also be affected by the measures, declined 16 rand, or 2.2
percent, to 697 rand, falling to its lowest level since March
11.  
 Famous Brands Ltd.  (FBR SJ), which owns fast-food chains in
South Africa, gained 74 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 30.74 rand,
its highest closing price since May 31. The soccer World Cup
spurred sales in June to jump 24 percent, equating to 83 percent
of its peak trading period in December, the company said in a
statement.  
 Hudaco Industries Ltd.  (HDC SJ), the mechanical and
electrical consumables importer and distributor, fell 3.40 rand,
or 4.8 percent, to 68 rand, its biggest drop since May 20. The
Elandsfontein, South Africa-based company said its headline
earnings remained “flat” at 107 million rand ($14 million) in
the first half of 2010. A lack of economic growth makes it
“difficult, if not impossible, to grow our existing
businesses”, the company said in a statement.
