             Total SA , Europe’s biggest refiner,
started work today to empty pipes of gas at its Flanders
refinery near Dunkirk in northern France.  
 Total spokesman  Michael Crochet-Vourey  said the operation
is needed both for both restarting the plant and dismantling it.
The oil company wants to push ahead with its plan to permanently
halt the refinery and make it into a training center, he said.  
 Total was ordered June 30 by the Douai Court of Appeal to
restart production at the refinery within 15 days or face fines
of 100,000 euros ($130,000) a day for failing to abide by French
labor laws. Total has asked a court in Nanterre to rule that it
met labor laws and has appealed the Douai decision.  
 The case was brought by labor unions that were against the
oil company’s decision to shut the refinery because of weak
demand for oil products. Workers ended a strike at the site
today to carry out the so-called degasification operations.
