             Estonia had its credit grade raised
at Fitch Ratings as the country prepares to join the euro area
in January after it outperformed the currency region’s existing
members on the bloc’s fiscal criteria.  
 Fitch upgraded the Estonia’s Long-term foreign and local
currency Issuer Default Rating to ‘A’ from ‘BBB+’ and ‘A-’,
respectively, it said in a statement today. The outlook is
stable, it said.  
 Estonia on May 12 won European Commission backing to join
the euro and will become the third eastern European country to
join the currency group after Slovenia and Slovakia. The former
Soviet state will have a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product this year on debt of 9.6 percent, the European
Commission said on May 5.  
 “Joining the euro area improves Estonia’s risk profile as
it reduces risks associated with the country’s sizeable external
debt and foreign currency lending in the domestic banking system,
and gives its banks access to European Central Bank liquidity
facilities,” said Douglas Renwick, Associate Director in
Fitch’s Sovereigns group.
