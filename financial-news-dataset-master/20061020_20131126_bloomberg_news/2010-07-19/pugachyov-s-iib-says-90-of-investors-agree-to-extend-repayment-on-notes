             International Industrial Bank , the
Russian lender controlled by lawmaker  Sergei Pugachyov , said 90
percent of investors in its 200 million euros ($253 million) of
9 percent notes agreed to extend repayments.  
 The bank will meet on July 21 with owners of the notes, on
which IIB defaulted earlier this month, to vote on whether to
pass “extraordinary resolutions from the meeting on July 6,”
the Moscow-based lender said in an e-mailed statement late on
July 16. According to preliminary results of the vote, 90
percent of the investors provided instructions to vote in favor
of the resolutions, IIB said.  
 IIB asked bondholders to extend the July 6 payment deadline
for a year after it won permission to restructure 32 billion
rubles ($1.03 billion) of debt to the central bank.  Credit
Suisse  Group AG is helping IIB with the negotiations.
