             If you use a mobile phone and
treasure your hearing, you may want to switch off the device for
a few minutes every day.  
 Prolonged use of the mobile phone may be associated with an
increase in the risk of developing chronic ringing in the ears,
according to a study published today in  Occupational &
Environmental Medicine , a BMJ Publishing Group journal. Patients
in Austria who used their mobiles for an average of 10 minutes a
day were 71 percent more likely to have the condition.  
 Some 50 million Americans suffer from ringing, buzzing or
other phantom noises in one or both ears, a condition known as
tinnitus, according to  American Tinnitus Association  estimates.
There is no cure for the malady, which disrupts sleep and
diminishes the ability to work and concentrate.  
 “Because tinnitus affects quality of life and current
therapeutic interventions have limited effectiveness, assessment
of potential risk factors and their prevention should be a
public health priority,” Hans-Peter Hutter, a researcher at the
Institute of Environmental Health at the University of Vienna,
and other authors wrote.  
 Regularly using a mobile phone for at least four years
appears to point to a doubling in the risk of developing a
chronic form of tinnitus, defined as having symptoms lasting at
least three months, according to the study.  
 Patient Groups  
 The authors compared 100 patients who required treatment
for chronic tinnitus with 100 randomly selected people without
the disorder, over the period of a year, London-based BMJ said
in a statement.  
 The two patient groups were matched for age and sex. Any
patient with ear disease, noise-induced impaired hearing, high
blood pressure, or who was on medication known to boost the risk
of tinnitus was excluded from the study. Almost all participants
were mobile-phone users.  
 An estimated 12 million Americans seek medical help for
 tinnitus , according to the association. They can use hearing
aids, medications and electronic masking devices to alleviate
symptoms. Suspected causes include exposure to noise, certain
drugs, allergies, tumors, heart problems or other types of
hearing loss. The prevalence of chronic tinnitus is increasing,
according to the research.
