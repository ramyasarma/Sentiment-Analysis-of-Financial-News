             President  Barack Obama  still wants
the U.S. Senate to confirm  Donald Berwick  as administrator of
the Centers for  Medicare  and Medicaid Services.  
 Obama resubmitted Berwick’s nomination to the Senate today.
He put Berwick in the job July 7 using a recess appointment, a
procedure that lets the president fill positions without Senate
confirmation when Congress isn’t in session. The nomination had
been stalled since it was submitted in April because of
opposition from some Republicans.  
 Sending the nomination to the Senate following the recess
appointment is “simply a formality,” said  Reid Cherlin , an
administration spokesman.  
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which
oversee the two government programs that benefit more than  100
million  poor, elderly and disabled Americans, haven’t had a
permanent administrator since October 2006.  
 Berwick, 63, previously was president and chief executive
officer of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and a
professor at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of
Public Health.
