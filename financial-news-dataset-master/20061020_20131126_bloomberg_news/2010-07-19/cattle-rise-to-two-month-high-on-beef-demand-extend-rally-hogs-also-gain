             Cattle rose to the highest price
since mid-May as demand for U.S. beef increased. Hogs also
gained.  
 Meatpackers slaughtered 666,000 head of cattle last week,
up 5 percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said in a report. Cattle futures have jumped 9.4
percent this year.  
 “It appears the meat demand has been adequate relative to
supply,” said  David Kruse , the president of Commstock
Investments in Royal, Iowa. “Meat demand has been good enough
that we’ve been able to pull some inventory forward” and drive
up prices for slaughter-ready animals, he said.  
 Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.7 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 94.325 cents a pound at 11:13 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price earlier rose to 94.5 cents, the
highest level since May 14. The most-active contract has not
declined since July 2.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.85 cent,
or 0.8 percent, to $1.13825 a pound.  
 Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.675 cent, or 0.9
percent, to 76.375 cents a pound in Chicago. Futures have
declined 6.7 percent this month, partly because of slack
domestic demand for pork.
