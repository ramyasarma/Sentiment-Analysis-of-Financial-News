             South Africa is pushing for lower 
prices for HIV medicines as it called for bids from 
pharmaceutical companies to supply the world’s biggest AIDS 
treatment program, Business Day said.  
 The government is seeking bidders for a 3.5 billion rand 
($462 million) two year-contract to supply it with anti-AIDS 
drugs, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing the tender
document. Higher volumes on the new contract will help 
compensate for reduced profit margins on the drugs, which is 
expected to reach 1.2 million people by 2012, Business Day said.
