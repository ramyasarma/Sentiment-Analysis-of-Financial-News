             Banks may be required to have a Tier
1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent under stress tests being
prepared by European regulators, the same threshold U.S. lenders
faced last year, according to two people briefed on the talks.  
 Firms that fail to meet the standard will be required to
raise additional capital, said one of the people, who had seen a
draft document from the  Committee of European Banking
Supervisors . Banks need to have a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 4
percent under international capital accords.  
 The CEBS draft document, dated July 13 and sent to national
regulators for review, said countries agreed to use at least the
same benchmark as the U.S., according to the person.  
 European Union regulators are examining the strength of 91
banks to determine if they can survive potential losses on
sovereign-bond holdings. They are counting on the tests to
reassure investors about the health of financial institutions
from Germany’s WestLB AG and Bayerische Landesbank to Spanish
savings banks as the debt crisis pummels the bonds of Greece,
Spain and Portugal. The results are slated to be released
starting at 6 p.m. Brussels time on July 23.  
 The stress tests assume a 3 percentage point deviation from
the European Commission’s economic forecasts over two years and
a deterioration of sovereign debt risk as compared to market
prices in early May, CEBS said. The EU estimates the region’s
economy will grow by 1 percent in 2010 and 1.7 percent in 2011.  
 Tier 1 Ratio  
 The Tier 1 capital ratio is a measure of financial strength
which compares a bank’s capital to the exposure of its loans and
other at-risk assets. It includes hybrid capital instruments
such as bonds that convert into equity when certain events
occur.  
 Banca Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna,  Bankinter SA  and  Banca
Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA , among the lenders with the lowest
capital ratios in the region, still have ratios of more than 7
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the
lenders’ most recent filings.  
 CEBS coordinates national banking authorities and makes
policy recommendations to the EU on regulation. Efstathia Bouli,
spokeswoman for the London-based group, declined to comment.
