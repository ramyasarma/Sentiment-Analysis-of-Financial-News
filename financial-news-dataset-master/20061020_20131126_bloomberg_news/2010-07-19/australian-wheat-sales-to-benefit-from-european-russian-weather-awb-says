             Australian wheat sales will benefit
from adverse weather conditions affecting Russia, Kazakhstan,
Canada and Europe and quality issues will create opportunities,
AWB Ltd. General Manager Commodities Mitch Morison said in a
statement today.  
 “Consumers of Russian and higher-protein German wheats
will need to source grain from alternative suppliers; this
translates as increased demand for Australian wheat into African
and Middle Eastern markets,” Morison said in the statement.
