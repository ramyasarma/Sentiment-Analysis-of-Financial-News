             Two men were convicted by a German
court for supporting al-Qaeda and recruiting members for the
terror network.  
 A 32-year-old Turkish citizen, identified only as Oemer
Oe., received a six-year prison term, the Higher Regional Court
of Koblenz, Germany, said in an e-mailed statement today. A 32-
year-old German, Sermet I., was sentenced to two and a half
years. Both worked for a man identified as Aleem N., who was
previously sentenced to eight years in prison.  
 “Oemer Oe. in 2005 and 2006 repeatedly organized cash and
equipment for the jihad and gave it to Aleem N.,” the court
said. “Aleem N. handed the money and the objects, including a
bulletproof vest and a laptop, to al-Qaeda representatives in
the Afghan-Pakistani border area.”  
 The three men worked for al-Qaeda in Germersheim, Germany,
until their arrests. Oemer Oe. was arrested in September 2008
and Sermet I. in February 2009. Oemer Oe. was also trained in a
terror camp and recruited a person who received that training,
according to the statement.
