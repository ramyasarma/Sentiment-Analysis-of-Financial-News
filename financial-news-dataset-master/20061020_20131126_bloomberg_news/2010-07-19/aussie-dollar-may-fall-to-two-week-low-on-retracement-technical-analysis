             The Australian dollar may fall to
the lowest level in almost two weeks against its U.S.
counterpart should it close below major support at 86.59 U.S.
cents, according to Forecast Pte, citing trading patterns.  
 The currency stalled at 88.71 cents on July 14 as it
approached the 100-day moving average, said  Pak Lai Ng , a
technical analyst at Forecast in Singapore. If the so-called
Aussie closes below 86.59 cents, a 38.2 percent retracement of
its rally in July, the currency is likely to extend losses to
the 50 percent retracement of 85.93 cents, Ng said, citing a
series of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence.  
 “The Aussie looks like it’s turning down,” Ng said in an
interview. “The 100-day and 200-day moving averages are capping
for now,” he said. The 100- and 200-day moving averages stand
at 88.71 cents and 89.70 cents, respectively.  
 The Australian dollar traded at 86.86 U.S. cents as of 8:22
a.m. in Sydney from 86.84 cents in New York yesterday, when it
touched 86.34 cents, the lowest level since July 8. The 85.93
cents level was last seen on July 7, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 The 14-day relative strength index, a gauge that compares
the magnitude of gains and declines in a currency, also suggests
the Aussie’s 4.5 percent surge from its July 1 low is losing
momentum, Ng said.  
 “The RSI has turned off” the Australian dollar’s
advancing trend, he said.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance or below support indicates a currency may
move to the next level. Support is an area where buy orders may
be clustered.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
