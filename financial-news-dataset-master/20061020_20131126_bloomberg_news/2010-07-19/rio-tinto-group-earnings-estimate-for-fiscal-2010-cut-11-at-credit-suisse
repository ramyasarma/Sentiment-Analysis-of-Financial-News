             Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-
largest mining company, had its earnings estimates cut by 11
percent for this financial year because of lower forecasts for
iron ore, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a report today.  
 Estimates for next year were reduced by 19.5 percent for
the following year, analysts led by Paul McTaggart said.
