             Education Management Corp.  and
 Corinthian Colleges Inc.  helped lead gains among shares of U.S.
for-profit colleges amid speculation President  Barack Obama ’s
proposed industry regulations won’t reduce profit as much as had
been projected.  
 The U.S. government is reviewing a proposed rule that would
disqualify for-profit colleges from receiving federal aid if
their graduates spend more than 8 percent of their starting
salaries repaying student loans. The U.S. Department of
Education planned to release the rule, known as gainful
employment, by August, the agency said in a June statement.  
 “There’s a rumor that the Department of Education are
briefing House and Senate staff on a loosening of the gainful
employment rules,” said  Trace Urdan , an analyst at Signal Hill
Capital Group LLC in San Francisco. “That’s driving the stocks.”  
 Signal Hill said in a report last week that changes to the
gainful employment provision may be less harmful to the industry
than had been feared.  
 Education Management jumped 10 percent to $17.39 at 2:26
p.m. today in New York.  Corinthian  rose 7.8 percent to $10.27.
Bridgepoint Education Inc. advanced 9.2 percent to $17.15.
Apollo Group Inc. climbed 4.9 percent to $47.82.  
 Career Education  
 Career Education Corp. advanced 3.8 percent to $25.88.
Capella Education Co. increased 8.9 percent to $87.75. Grand
Canyon Education Inc. rose 4.3 percent to $21.50. DeVry Inc.
rallied 1 percent to $53.37.  ITT Educational Services Inc. 
climbed 2.6 percent to $88.81.  
 Education Management, based in Pittsburgh, has fallen 32
percent from its 2010 high. Corinthian Colleges in Santa Ana,
California, has dropped 47 percent since its peak.  
 Last month, Senator  Tom Harkin , the Iowa Democrat who
chairs the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee,  said  for-profit colleges need tougher oversight
during a  hearing . Obama’s administration on June 16 proposed
regulation of the industry because of concern that recruiters
are signing up unqualified students and leaving them with loans
they may be unable to repay.
