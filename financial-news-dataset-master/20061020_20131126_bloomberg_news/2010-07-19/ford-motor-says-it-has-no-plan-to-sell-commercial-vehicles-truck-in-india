             Ford Motor Co. said it has no plans
to sell commercial vehicles in India, denying a Financial
Express newspaper report that said the company will begin
selling trucks in the country soon.  
 The report is “pure speculation,” Deepti Seethie, a
spokeswoman for Ford’s India unit, said in a phone interview
today.
