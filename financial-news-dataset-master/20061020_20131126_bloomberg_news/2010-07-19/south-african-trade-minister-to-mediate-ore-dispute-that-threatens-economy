             South African Minister of Trade and
Industry  Rob Davies  is mediating in a dispute over ore prices
between  Anglo American Plc ’s  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.  unit and
and  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd.   
 A meeting was held at the offices of the Department
of Trade and Industry in Pretoria today and another will be held
on July 22, the department said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 ArcelorMittal South Africa , which supplies 70 percent of
the country’s steel needs, is in dispute with Kumba over an
iron-ore supply contract which the miner canceled in March.
South Africa’s government has said it will ensure the
disagreement, which is now in arbitration, doesn’t harm the
economy.  
 “There was constructive engagement toward seeking a
solution,” the department said. “All parties committed
themselves to reaching an agreement which will put the country
first.”  
 Earlier today Kumba said it didn’t expect a final solution
from today’s meeting. Kumba Chief Executive Officer  Chris Griffith  was scheduled to attend. ArcelorMittal South Africa
spokesman  Julian Gwillim  earlier said the meeting was a “step
in the right direction.”  
 Kumba from March 1 canceled the nine-year-old agreement
that gave ArcelorMittal South Africa ore from its Sishen mine at
3 percent above what it cost to mine it and demanded that it pay
higher rates. In response the steelmaker, which is part-owned
and run by Luxembourg-based  ArcelorMittal , has threatened to cut
4,000 jobs, halt exports and close its Saldanha steel mill.  
 Today it sent notices to customers warning of steel
shortages, Hennie de Clercq, executive director of the
Johannesburg-based Southern African Institute of Steel
Construction, said in an interview with Talk Radio 702 in the
city. Themba Hlangani, a spokesman for ArcelorMittal South
Africa, said he couldn’t immediately comment when called.  
 “These are credible threats from ArcelorMittal,” de
Clercq said.
