             German stocks fell for a third day,
erasing earlier gains, after an index of U.S. homebuilder
confidence dropped to 15-month low, stoking concern about the
strength of the world’s largest economy.  
 MAN SE, Europe’s third-largest truckmaker, paced declining
shares, falling more than 2 percent. Volkswagen AG lost 1.1
percent amid a report Europe’s largest carmaker may face damage
claims of 2.4 billion euros ($3.1 billion) related to an
unsuccessful takeover bid from Porsche SE.  
 The benchmark  DAX Index  dropped 43.04, or 0.7 percent, to
5,997.5 at 4:56 p.m. in Frankfurt as all but six stocks fell.
The gauge, which earlier today rose as much as 0.7 percent, is
down 5.1 percent from this year’s high on April 26 amid concern
about the fallout from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. The
broader HDAX Index dropped 0.6 percent today.  
 Stocks reversed gains after the Washington-based National
Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo confidence index
dropped to 14 this month. That compares to 16 in June and is the
lowest level since April 2009. Readings lower than 50 mean more
respondents said conditions were poor.  
 MAN lost 2.5 percent to 70.74 euros, Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG, the world’s largest maker of luxury cars, declined 1.9
percent to 41.35 euros and HidelbergCement AG fell 1.6 percent
to 36.45 euros.  
 Preferred shares of Volkswagen also retreated, falling 1.1
percent to 75.19 euros. The carmaker may face damage claims of
2.4 billion euros for failing to disclose information about a
takeover bid from Porsche that ultimately was unsuccessful, Der
Spiegel reported, citing  Franz Braun , an attorney at Munich-
based law firm CLLB.  
 Preferred shares of Porsche slipped 1.7 percent to 36.10
euros.  
 Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG  rallied 6 percent to 7.73
euros after the world’s largest maker of printing presses said
preliminary orders in the first quarter rose 43 percent from a
year earlier to 786 million euros, helped by increasing demand
in China.
