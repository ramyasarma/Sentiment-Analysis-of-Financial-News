             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell for a fifth day, the longest streak since
January, after consumer prices in Sao Paulo rose less than
forecast, giving policy makers less reason to raise interest
rates.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 11.04 percent at 10:13 a.m. New York time. Earlier it
touched 11 percent, the lowest level since June 8. It dropped
for five straight days in the period ended Jan. 8.  
 “Given that inflation has been coming in lower than what
was expected, it prompts economists to adjust their interest-
rate expectations lower for the coming months,” said  Ram Bala Chandran , a Latin America currency and rates analyst at
Citigroup Inc. in New York.  
 Consumer prices in Sao Paulo rose 0.12 percent in the
second week of July. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 12 economists was for an advance of 0.15 percent.  
 Brazil’s consumer inflation by year-end will be 5.42
percent, compared with a week-earlier forecast of 5.45 percent,
according to the median forecast in a July 16 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today.  
 Brazil’s central bank will raise borrowing costs by three-
quarters of a percentage point to 11 percent at the conclusion
of a two-day policy meeting on July 21, according to all 31
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Futures contracts indicate
policy makers will lift the rate by less than 75 basis points.  
 Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  that further interest-rate increases are a
“concern,” O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper reported today,
without saying how it obtained the information.  
 Mantega told Lula at a July 14 meeting that economic growth
in the next two years may be compromised if the central bank
raises the benchmark rate to 11 percent this week, the newspaper
reported.  
 The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.7778 per dollar, from 1.7821
on July 16.
