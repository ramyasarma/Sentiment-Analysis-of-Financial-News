             Banco Votorantim SA, the financial
services unit of Votorantim Group, plans to sell more of its
bonds due in 2020 as soon as today, according to a person
familiar with the transaction.  
 Banco Votorantim may sell the bonds to yield between 7
percent and 7.125 percent, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set. Bank of America Corp.,
 Banco do Brasil SA , Deutsche Bank AG, Itau Unibanco Holding SA
and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are arranging the sale,
according to the person. Banco Votorantim initially sold the
7.375 percent subordinated notes on Jan. 12.  
 The Sao Paulo-based bank is returning to international debt
markets after yields on the securities fell to 6.66 percent last
week, the lowest since they were issued, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Brazilian companies, led by Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA,
sold a combined $1.3 billion of bonds last week, the most since
the week ended April 30.
