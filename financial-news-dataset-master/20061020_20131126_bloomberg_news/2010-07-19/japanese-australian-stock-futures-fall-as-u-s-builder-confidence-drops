             Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  fell after U.S. home-builder confidence dropped more
than forecast and the dollar weakened, renewing concern a global
economic recovery may falter.  
 American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., a Japanese
camera maker that gets almost 80 percent of its revenue abroad,
slid 1.5 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo on July
16. Those of Sony Corp., an electronics maker, lost 2 percent.
ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
rose 0.7 percent from the Sydney close after metal prices gained.  
 “There’s concern about a deterioration of the U.S.
economy,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co.  
 Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,270 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
the average’s close of 9,408.36 on July 16. Futures were bid in

today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent in Wellington.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.5 percent
today. In New York yesterday, the index rose 0.6 percent as

overshadowed a drop in financial shares.  
 The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
confidence index dropped to 14 this month, the lowest level
since April 2009, from 16 in June, data from the Washington-
based group showed yesterday. Builders in the U.S. turned more
pessimistic in July than forecast, a sign the expiration of a
government tax credit will depress home construction.

today in Tokyo from 87.06 at the close of stock trading on July
16. Against the euro, the currency gained to as much as 112.14
from 112.35. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas income
at Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.

percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
