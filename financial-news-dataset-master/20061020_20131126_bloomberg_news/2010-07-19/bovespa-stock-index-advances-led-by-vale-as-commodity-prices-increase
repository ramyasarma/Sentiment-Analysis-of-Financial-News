             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index rose
the most in a week on speculation companies will report second-
quarter profit growth and as rising commodities prices boosted
producers.  
 MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA  led gains among
homebuilders and  Banco Bradesco SA  led a rally in banks on
speculation earnings reports will show higher interest rates
haven’t hurt domestic demand.  Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, and  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA , controlled by
billionaire  Eike Batista , rose for the first time in four days
as metals prices increased.  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA ,
Batista’s oil company, climbed as crude rallied in New York.  
 The  Bovespa  jumped 1.5 percent, the most since July 7, to
63,297.04 after the 4 p.m. New York time close in Sao Paulo.
Fifty-six stocks gained on the measure while eight fell. The
 BM&FBovespa Small Cap  index advanced 1.3 percent to 1,206.42.
The real weakened for a fourth day, losing 0.6 percent to 1.7922
per dollar.  
 “Last week was bad, and we’re entering earnings season now
with expectations that results will be very good,” said  Mirela Rappaport , who manages 150 million reais ($84 million) at
Investport in Sao Paulo.  
 The Bovespa on July 16 fell the most in more than two weeks
as confidence in the U.S. economy diminished and commodities
prices fell.  
 Interest Rates  
 MRV Engenharia , Brazil’s fifth-biggest homebuilder by
revenue, reached a record closing price, jumping 3.8 percent to
15.11 reais and helping push the 14-member  BM&FBovespa Real
Estate Index  up 2.4 percent.  Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-
biggest bank by market value, advanced 2.3 percent to 29.49
reais, helping the MSCI Brazil/Financials Index increase 1.4
percent.  
 Brazil’s central bank has raised the benchmark Selic rate
to 10.25 percent this year from a record low of 8.75 percent.
Policy makers may boost the rate an additional 75 basis points,
or 0.75 percentage point, when they meet this week, according to
all 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Vale gained 2.6 percent to 38.50 reais while MMX rose 3.9
percent to 10.70 reais. OGX climbed 1.5 percent to 17.97 reais.  
 U.S. stocks fluctuated in earlier trading after a report
showed builders in the U.S. turned more pessimistic in July than
forecast, a sign the expiration of a government tax credit will
depress home construction.  
 ‘Double-Dip’ Recession  
 The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
confidence index dropped to 14 this month, the lowest level
since April 2009, from 16 in June, data from the Washington-
based group showed today. Readings lower than 50 mean more
respondents said conditions were poor.  
 “Investors still fear the specter of a double-dip
recession,” Rappaport said.  
 The  Bovespa index  trades for 11.8 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.6 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.3
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.4 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
