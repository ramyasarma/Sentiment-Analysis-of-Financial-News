             U.S. milk production increased 2.4
percent in June as a rise in per-cow output more than made up
for a smaller dairy herd, according to the Department of
Agriculture.  
 Production  climbed for the fourth straight month, to 16.324
billion pounds (7.4 billion kilograms) from 15.935 billion in
June 2009, the USDA said today in a  report . The  dairy herd  fell
1.2 percent to 9.122 million head while the average cow produced
1,790 pounds of milk last month, an increase of 3.7 percent from
1,726 pounds, the USDA said.  
 “We had a little more milk as productivity offset the
reduction in cow numbers,” said  Bill Brooks , an economist for
Chicago-based broker Downes-O’Neill LLC. “Temperatures were not
hot enough to hurt production in June, but may trim output this
month.”  
 Class III milk futures has gained 49 percent in the past
year, due to increases in domestic demand and exports of butter
and powdered milk, Brooks said. The August contract today added
2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $14.92 per hundred pounds on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
 The price sank to a six-year low of $9.24 in February 2009,
after output set a record high in 2008. To halt losses, dairy
farmers shrank their herds by sending more animals to beef
plants in 2009.  
 The  average price  U.S. farmers will get for all milk this
year will be $15.95 per 100 pounds, up 24 percent from 2009, the
USDA said July 9. Annual production will rise 1 percent to 191.2
billion pounds from 189.3 billion last year, the government
said.  
 Whole milk at the supermarket averaged $3.297 a gallon (3.8
liters) in June, up 11 percent from a five-year low in August,
the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week. The price was the
highest since February 2009.  
 U.S. dairy-product exports rose 22 percent to 605,396
metric tons during the first five months of 2010 from a year
earlier, USDA data show.  
 “The volume of exports has been slowly improving,” Brooks
said. “Demand may slow down next month ahead of peaks in
production in New Zealand and Australia” in October, he said.
