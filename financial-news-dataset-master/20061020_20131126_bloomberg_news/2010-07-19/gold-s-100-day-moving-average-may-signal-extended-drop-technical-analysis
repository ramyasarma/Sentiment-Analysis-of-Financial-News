             Gold may extend declines to the
lowest price in almost three months after slipping below a key
moving average, according  Bayram Dincer  at LGT Capital
Management.  
 The attached chart shows the precious metal is trading near
its 100-day moving average of $1,177.60 an ounce on the Comex in
New York. A settlement below that price may send prices near the
next area of support, at $1,145, according to technical analysis
by Dincer. The last time gold touched that level was on April
23.  
 “The technical picture in gold as it trades near the 100-
day moving average is very important,” Dincer said by telephone
from Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. “This is a pivotal level. Post-
price behavior studies indicate more price losses if it crosses
and closes below.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery fell $8.40, or 0.7
percent, to $1,179.80 an ounce at 11:39 a.m. on the Comex, after
slipping as much as 1 percent to $1,176.90.  
 Before today, gold had gained 8.4 percent this year,
reaching a record $1,266.50 on June 21. The metal also touched
all-time highs in euros, British sterling and Swiss francs as
investors sought a haven during Europe’s fiscal crisis.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
