             Air travel isn’t necessarily
dangerous for people with some heart conditions, a U.K. panel
said in new guidance.  
 Low-risk patients may fly as soon as three days after a
heart attack, according to a  British Cardiovascular Society 
working group  report  published today in the journal  Heart . The
panel recommended that only patients with high-risk conditions
defer air travel until their condition stabilizes.  
 “The aircraft cabin environment doesn’t pose a major
threat,” David Smith, chairman of the working group and a
cardiologist at the  Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust ,
said in a telephone interview. “But you don’t want to be in the
plane if something is likely to happen.”  
 The panel began working on guidelines after the House of
Lords asked for guidance on potential heart risks of air travel.
Flights longer than four hours double a traveler’s risk of
potentially deadly blood clots, a  World Health Organization 
study found in 2007. Known as deep-vein thrombosis, the clots
can form in the legs and be fatal when they move to the lungs.  
 Obese or pregnant passengers or those with a history of
blood clots should wear compression stockings, keep mobile and
drink plenty of non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic drinks, the U.K.
panel recommended. The risk is similar to traveling by bus,
train or car for the same length of time, the group said. The
panel also issued fitness-to-fly recommendations for patients
with irregular heartbeat, chronic heart failure, valve disease
and other conditions.  
 Some potential health threats come before passengers ever
board the plane, due to anxiety, anger about delays and the
physical exertion of lugging baggage through the airport, the
authors wrote.
