             German 10-year government bond
yields rose from the lowest level in a week as rising stocks
outweighed concerns over peripheral euro-region nations after a
downgrade of Irish debt by Moody’s Investors Service.  
 The yield on Irish 10-year bonds rose seven basis points
relative to equivalent-maturity bunds, Europe’s benchmark
government security. Moody’s downgraded Ireland’s bonds one step
to Aa2 from Aa1, citing the nation’s “gradual but significant
loss of financial strength.” The Stoxx Europe 600 Index and
U.S. stock-index futures both gained.  
 “The downgrade is not good, but it’s not a big surprise,”
said  Marcel Bross , an interest-rate strategist at Commerzbank AG
in Frankfurt. “It will be difficult to push bund yields much
lower in the short term, because most of the negative news has
already been priced in.”  
 The 10-year bund yield rose six basis points to 2.65
percent as of 12:16 p.m. in London. The 3 percent security due
July 2020 fell 0.53, or 5.3 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,293) face
amount, to 102.975. Two-year yields also rose six basis points,
to 0.83 percent.  
 The difference in yield, or  spread , between Irish and
German 10-year government bonds widened three basis points to
286 basis points.  
 Ireland plans to sell up to 1.5 billion euros of 2016 and
2020 bonds tomorrow, while Germany is scheduled to auction 4
billion euros of 30-year bonds and 1 billion euros of 10-year
inflation-linked securities on July 21.  
 Irish Auction  
 Ireland’s sales “are likely to go well, in line with the
Portuguese auctions last week, given the large concession priced
in,”  Wilson Chin , a senior debt strategist at ING Bank NV in
Amsterdam, wrote in a research note today. “The supply will be
rather light this week.”  
 Reports this week are forecast to show a slowdown in
manufacturing and services growth, and weakening business
confidence.  
 A composite index of services and manufacturing based on a
survey of euro-area purchasing managers in both industries fell
to 55 in July from 56 in June, London-based Markit Economics
will say on July 22, according to the median estimate of 18
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The  Ifo  institute in Munich will say its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives in Germany, fell to
101.5 in July from 101.8 in June, the median estimate of 41
economists shows.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  rose 0.3 percent, snapping a
three-day drop.
