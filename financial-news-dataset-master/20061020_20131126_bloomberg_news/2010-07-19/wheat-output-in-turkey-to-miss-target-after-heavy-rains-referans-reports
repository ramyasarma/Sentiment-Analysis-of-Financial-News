             Turkey will have 15 percent less
wheat than forecast in 2010/2011 because of rains and flash
floods this spring,  Referans  said, citing a regional trade
bourse head.  
 Turkey’s wheat production was earlier forecast at 20
million tons, the newspaper said, citing Ugur Kaleli, head of
the trade bourse in Turkey’s breadbasket of Konya.
