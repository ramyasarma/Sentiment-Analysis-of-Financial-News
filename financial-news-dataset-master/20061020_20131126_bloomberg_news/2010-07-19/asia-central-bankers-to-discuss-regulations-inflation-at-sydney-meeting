             Central bank governors from East
Asian and Pacific countries will meet this week to discuss
international regulatory standards and inflationary pressures,
the Bank of Korea said today.  
 The Executives’ Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central
Banks, or Emeap, will be held in Sydney, Australia, from July 21
to July 23, the bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Bank
of Korea Governor  Kim Choong Soo  will attend the meeting,
according to the statement.  
 Asian countries from South Korea to India have raised
interest rates from crisis levels as the region leads the global
economic recovery from a slump triggered by the financial
crisis. The International Monetary Fund said earlier this month
some emerging nations have “appropriately tightened” monetary
policy in response to rising inflation or asset price pressures.  
 The Emeap has 11 members: South Korea, China, Japan,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Hong
Kong, Australia, and New Zealand.
