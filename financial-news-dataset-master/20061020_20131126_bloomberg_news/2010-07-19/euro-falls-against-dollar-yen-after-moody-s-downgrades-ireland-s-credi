             The euro weakened after Moody’s
Investors Service lowered Ireland’s sovereign debt rating by one
notch, fueling demand for perceived safer currencies such as the
dollar and Japanese yen.  
 The single currency fell against 11 of its 16 most actively
traded counterparts as Moody’s today cut Ireland’s rating to Aa2
from Aa1, citing the government’s “gradual but significant loss
of financial strength.” The agency has a “stable” outlook on
the country’s debt, it said today in an e-mailed statement.
Moody’s also cut its rating on Ireland’s so-called bad bank, the
National Asset Management Agency, to Aa2 with a stable outlook.  
 “Ireland’s downgrade weighed on the euro,” said  Neil Mellor , a currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
in London. “This doesn’t come as a surprise given the problems
surrounding the Irish banking sector. We are far away from any
point of stability as far as the euro outlook is concerned.”  
 The euro weakened 0.4 percent against the dollar to $1.2878
as of 7:49 a.m. in London. It reached $1.3008 at the end of last
week, the strongest level since May 10. It fell 0.3 percent
versus the Japanese currency, to 111.62 yen today after reaching
111.44 earlier.
