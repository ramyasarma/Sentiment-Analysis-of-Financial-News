             Flooding in China’s Yangtze River,
possibly the worst since 1998, may reach the world’s biggest dam
tomorrow morning.  
 Water flow may reach about 70,000 cubic meters a second
when the flood peaks, China Three Gorges Corp., the dam’s
operator, said on its  website  today, citing President Chen Fei
in an interview with state-run China Central Television.  
 Floods and landslides after rainstorms killed 34 people and
left 87 missing in west China’s Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces,
Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing local authorities.
China Three Gorges, the parent of Shanghai-listed China Yangtze
Power Co., is building dams on the Yangtze River, Asia’s longest,
to control floods and help end electricity shortages in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.  
 Tomorrow’s flood will be the greatest since the Three
Gorges Dam started operations in 2003, the Hubei-based company
said.
