             Jennifer Convertibles Inc. , an
unprofitable retailer of sofa beds, filed for bankruptcy
protection and agreed to give its biggest unsecured creditor
stock in the reorganized company.  
 The Woodbury, New York-based company listed $46.4 million
in debt and assets of $25.9 million as of July 16 in Chapter 11
documents filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
Eleven affiliates also filed.  
 “The decision to file for Chapter 11 protection was based
primarily on lack of liquidity which resulted from the
substantial losses the company has incurred in recent periods,”
the retailer said today in a statement. The company has reported
net losses in each of the past 10  quarters , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The company, which owns 142 Jennifer Convertibles-branded
stores and 12 Jennifer Leather stores, and runs five Ashley
Furniture HomeStores, said it agreed with supplier Haining
Mengnu Group Co. to convert a large portion of debt into new
stock.  
 The company and its units’ 30 largest creditors without
collateral backing their claims are owed about $26.3 million,
according to court documents. Haining Mengnu is the biggest,
with a claim of $16.7 million, and will continue to supply goods
to the company while it restructures, the retailer said.  
 Jennifer Convertibles said its business won’t be
interrupted and obligations to customers and workers will be
fulfilled.  
 The case is In re Jennifer Convertibles Inc., 10-13779,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
