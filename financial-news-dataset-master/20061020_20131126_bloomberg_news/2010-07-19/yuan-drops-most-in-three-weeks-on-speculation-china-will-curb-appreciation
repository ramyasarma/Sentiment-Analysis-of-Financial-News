             China’s yuan declined the most in
two weeks on speculation the government will limit appreciation
to support local exporters amid signs a global recovery is
losing steam. Government bonds advanced.  
 The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate 0.12
percent weaker at 6.7800 per dollar, the first decline in four
days. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the global economy is recovering
at a “very slow” pace and the government will maintain policies
to ensure favorable conditions for businesses, according to a
State Council  statement  published yesterday.  
 “The comments signaled the government won’t permit a fast
appreciation,” said  Liu Dongliang , a Shenzhen-based analyst at
China Merchants Bank Co., the country’s fifth-largest lender by
market value. “The data announced last week shows high risks of
a further slowdown in the economy.”  
 The yuan dropped 0.07 percent to 6.7798 per dollar as of
12:15 p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade system. It’s strengthened 0.7 percent since a two-year peg
was relaxed on June 19.  
 China’s  economic growth  eased to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter, from an 11.9 percent pace in the previous three months,
the statistics bureau said on July 15.  Industrial production  in
June rose 13.7 percent from a year earlier, following a 16.5
percent gain in May.  
 Bonds Advance  
 Government bonds advanced as interbank lending costs
extended a three-week decline, reflecting improved liquidity in
the financial system.  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures funding
availability between banks, slid one basis point to 1.86 percent
today, after tumbling 45 basis points last week, according to a
daily fixing rate published by the National Interbank Funding
Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 The People’s Bank of China has  added  cash into the money
market for eight consecutive weeks via open-market operations,
helping relieving a cash shortage that drove the repo rate to a
19-month high of 3.28 percent on June 2.  
 “The slides in the yields were mainly caused by eased
liquidity at banks,” said  Liu Junyu , a bond analyst at China
Merchants Bank. “The central bank may not inject money so
aggressively in the coming weeks like before and bond yields
will see small adjustments.”  
 The yield on the 3.48 percent government note due in July
2019 fell one basis point to 3.15 percent, and the price of the
security added 0.08 per 100 yuan face amount to 102.57,
according to the Funding Center.
