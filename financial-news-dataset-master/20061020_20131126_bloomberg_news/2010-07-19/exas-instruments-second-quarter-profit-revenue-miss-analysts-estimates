             Texas Instruments Inc. , the second-
largest U.S. chipmaker, reported profit and sales that missed
analysts’ estimates. The shares dropped in late trading.  
 Second-quarter profit  rose to $769 million, or 62 cents a
share, from $260 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier, the
Dallas-based company said today in a statement. Sales increased
42 percent to $3.5 billion. Analysts on average estimated profit
of 63 cents a share and sales of $3.52 billion, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Texas Instruments is the largest maker of analog chips,
which go into  everything  from barcode scanners to aircraft
flight-control systems, making its earnings a broad indicator of
demand for industrial and electronic machinery. The company’s
results failed to match those of  Intel Corp.  last week, which
delivered earnings and forecasts that topped estimates.  
 “With Intel reporting such strong numbers last week, the
market may have set themselves up to be disappointed,” said
 Bill Kreher , an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “After
several quarters of being able to beat expectations, Texas
Instruments was only able to meet on this occasion.”  
 Texas Instruments declined 6 percent to $24.02 in after-
hours trading, after  rising  78 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $25.55
at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has dropped
2 percent  this year .  
 Kreher  rates  the shares “hold” and doesn’t own any himself.  
 Intel said last week that corporate spending to update
aging personal-computer networks and servers helped buoy demand
for its chips.  
 Inventory Widens  
 Inventory climbed 5.7 percent from the first quarter to
$1.35 billion, the company said. Compared with a year earlier,
inventory rose by $286 million, or 27 percent.  
 Third-quarter  earnings will be 64 cents to 74 cents a share
on sales of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, the company said.
 Analysts  had predicted profit of 65 cents a share and revenue of
$3.6 billion on average, according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Rich Templeton  is getting out of
the market for digital signal processors that manage radio
functions in mobile phones -- an area the company once
dominated. Texas Instruments is focusing instead on analog
chips, where it expects to win more orders and grow faster, he
has said.  
 The company ranked second to Intel among U.S. chipmakers in
total sales last year.

                          July 19 (Bloomberg) -- Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management LLC, talks with Bloomberg's Mark Crumpton about the outlook for technology earnings.
     Santa Clara, California-based Intel Corp., whose processors run more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers, last week reported record second-quarter sales and topped analysts’ estimates with its forecast for the current period.
