             Ghana’s  economy expanded 4.1 percent
last year, less than previously estimated, according to revised
data reported by the Ghana Statistical Service.  
 Growth was revised from 4.7 percent and compared with 7.3
percent in 2008, the service said in a statement given to
reporters today in the capital, Accra. Expansion missed the 5.9
percent targeted in last year’s budget.  
 The economy is on course to achieve its growth target for
this year of 6.5 percent after inflation slowed and interest
rates fell, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning,  Kwabena Duffuor , said by phone on July 16. The inflation rate fell below
10 percent in June for the first time since December 2007, the
Statistical Service said on July 14.  
 “Inflation and interest rates have declined to record
lows,” Duffuor said. “That is the impetus our private
industries need to expand.”  
 The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate to
13.5 percent from 15 percent on July 16, bringing the total
reduction this year to 4.5 points.  
 The bank’s index that tracks the pace of economic activity
grew 7.2 percent in the first half, higher than the 2.8 percent
recorded in the same period last year, central bank Governor
 Kwesi Amissah-Arthur  said at the July 16.  
 Agriculture expanded 6.1 percent last year, services grew
5.9 percent, and industrial output increased 1.6 percent, the
statistics agency said.
