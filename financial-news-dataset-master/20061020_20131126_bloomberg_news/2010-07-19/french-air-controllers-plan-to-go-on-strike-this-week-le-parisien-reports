             French air traffic controllers will
begin a work stoppage tomorrow evening through July 22, Le Parisien
newspaper reported.  
 Similar strikes earlier this year disrupted 15 percent to
20 percent of flights at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle, Paris’s main
airport, and as many as 50 percent at Orly, the secondary
airport, the newspaper said.  
 The controllers are protesting a law integrating French air
traffic control into a European system. The largest controllers’
union, the SNCTA, does not plan to strike, the newspaper said.
