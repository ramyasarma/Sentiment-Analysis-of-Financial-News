             The euro may strengthen to $1.35
against the U.S. dollar should it remain above a key support
level, Commerzbank AG said, citing technical indicators.  
 The euro broke above $1.30 last week, the first time since
May 10, reaching “psychologically important” so-called
resistance,  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency technical analysis at Commerzbank in London, wrote in
an e-mailed report today.  
 While the $1.30 level may “cause the market to pause near
term,” Commerzbank’s so-called inverse head and shoulders chart
pattern “offers a minimum upside measured target to $1.3120.”  
 After a one to three month period, “there is room for this
correction higher to extend further, and we would allow for a
rally to reach $1.3465/$1.3510 double Fibonacci retracement”
before the euro falls, wrote Jones.  
 The $1.3465 level is the 50 percent retracement of the move
this year, and the $1.3510 level is the 38.2 percent retracement
of the decline from the $1.6040 peak in 2008 peak, according to
Commerzbank.  
 The euro gained 0.26 percent to $1.2964 as of 12:54 p.m. in
London.  
 Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, currency or index.
Support is where buy orders may be grouped, and resistance is a
level where sell orders may be clustered. Fibonacci analysis is
based on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain
percentages after reaching a high or low.
