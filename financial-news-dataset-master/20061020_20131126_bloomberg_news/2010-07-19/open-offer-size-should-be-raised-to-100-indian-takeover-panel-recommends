             India’s capital markets regulator
should require companies to seek to buy all the equity they
don’t already own in target companies during an open offer
triggered by raising their stake to the threshold level,
according to recommendations made by a panel formed by the
Securities and Exchange Board of India today.  
 The acquirer is required to offer to buy a 20 percent stake
in the target company in the open offer under current rules, C.
Achuthan, who heads the panel that reviewed the nation’s
takeover rules, told reporters in Mumbai today.
