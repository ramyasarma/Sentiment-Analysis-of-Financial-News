             Running back  Chris Johnson  will join
the Tennessee Titans at training camp after agreeing to terms on
a new contract for the 2010 season, the Tennessean reported on

 Johnson, 24, last year became the sixth player in National
Football League history to top 2,000 yards rushing in a season,
finishing with 358 carries for 2,006 yards and 14 touchdowns.  
 Johnson and the Titans had been in discussions to increase
the $550,000 base salary he was supposed to receive this year as
part of the five-year, $12 million rookie deal he signed in
2008. Johnson reached performance-based incentives would have
given him an extra $2.5 million in salary in 2012. That money
will be moved into a signing bonus for this season under the new
agreement, the  Tennessean said , citing an unidentified person
close to the negotiations.  
 Johnson was voted the NFL’s offensive player of the year
