             GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , operator of  Europe ’s
largest natural gas network, extended a contract with GasTerra
BV to 2029 to provide about 15 percent of its supply, mostly for
the French and Belgian markets.  
 “Natural gas from the Netherlands makes a leading
contribution to the security of gas supplies for Western
Europe,” Jean-Francois Cirelli, vice president of the Paris-based utility, said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 GasTerra, a venture between the Dutch state, Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , will supply GDF Suez with
volumes amounting to 15 percent of its portfolio “in the future
years,” GDF said.  
 The French utility raised hydrocarbon production by 20
percent last year, in part from an acquisition of offshore
fields and pipelines held by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij
BV. The 1.08 billion-euro purchase made it the largest oil and
gas operator in the Dutch North Sea. The utility said trading in
liquefied natural gas will slow this year.
