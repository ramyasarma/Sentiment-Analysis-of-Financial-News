             Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) , the
largest U.S. maker of generic drugs, reported positive results
for its experimental prostate treatment in two late-state trials.  
 The drug, silodosin, was more effective than a placebo in
treating enlarged prostates, or benign prostatic hyperplasia, the
Corona, California-based company said today in a statement on PR
Newswire. The tests were in the final of three phases of trials
normally needed for regulatory approval.  
 Non-cancerous enlarged prostate affects more than half of
American men in their 60s and as many as 90 percent of them by
age 85, Watson said. Prescription drug sales to treat the
disorder total $1.7 billion a year, the company said.  
 Watson plans to apply for U.S. approval to market the drug
in the first half of 2008, after completion later this year of a
one-year safety trial, the company said. The two studies reported
today showed that cardiovascular and blood-pressure side effects
were low, Watson said.
