             Russian stocks dropped, led by OAO
Sberbank after a report showed the U.S. unexpectedly lost jobs in
August, deepening concern the world's biggest economy may stall
in the second half.  
 The ruble-denominated  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  declined 2.1 percent to
1,638.11, its biggest decline in more than three weeks. Six
stocks advanced, 23 retreated and one was unchanged. The index
lost 2.3 percent during the week. The dollar-denominated  RTS
Index (RTSI$)  declined 1.3 percent to 1,896.84.  
 The U.S. Labor Department said employers cut 4,000 workers
from the payrolls in August, the first loss in jobs in four years.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated a gain of 100,000
jobs. Emerging-market bonds declined after the report, sparking
concern countries including  Russia  will have to pay more to borrow.  
 ``All the banks will get hit and any companies who have
borrowed heavily,'' said Zina Psiola, who manages about $700
million in Russian stocks at Clariden Leu AG in Zurich. ``Banks
including VTB won't have any cheap financing anymore.''  
 Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank, tumbled 3 percent to 93.80
rubles on the Micex Stock Exchange. VTB Group, Russia's second-
biggest publicly traded bank, dropped 3.6 percent to 11.44 kopeks,
a record low. Bank Vozrozhdenie, a regional mortgage lender, sank
for a fifth day, falling 1.9 percent to 1,356.66 rubles.  
 Energy stocks, which make up the biggest part of Russian
equity indexes, sank as  oil prices  slipped for the first time in
more than a week.  Brent crude  for October delivery fell 9 cents,
or 0.1 percent, to $74.68 a barrel in  London . The Micex Oil & Gas
index sank 2.3 percent.  
 OAO Surgutneftegaz, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer,
fell 3 percent to 31.089 rubles.  
 OAO Tatneft, the oil producer in Russia's republic of
Tatarstan, tumbled 3.8 percent to 124.19 rubles.
