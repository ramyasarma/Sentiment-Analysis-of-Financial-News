             OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , Russia's natural-gas
export monopoly, plans to increase its electricity business in
five European countries, including France and Ireland.  
 ``The company plans to expand its presence in the
electricity markets of France, the Netherlands,  Belgium , Ireland
and Germany,'' Deputy Chief Executive Officer Alexander Ananenkov
told shareholders at their annual meeting in Moscow today.
Gazprom already has trading operations in those countries.  
 State-run Gazprom supplies a quarter of Europe's gas and
plans to build a power plant in Germany to help secure sales of
its fuel and reach consumers directly. Gazprom Marketing and
Trading Ltd., the company's U.K. unit, signed an accord in April
to build an 800-megawatt power plant in Eisenhuettenstadt,
 Germany  with Luxembourg-based Soteg AG.  
 The company may also make purchases in Russia's power
industry, Ananenkov said.  
 ``The company is examining the acquisition of shares in
electricity generating companies formed as a result of the
restructuring of RAO UES,'' he said, referring to national
utility OAO Unified Energy System.
