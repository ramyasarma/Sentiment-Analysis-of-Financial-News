             Sumitomo Real Estate Sales Co., a
Japanese property broker, sank the most in more than a month on
concern the commission policies of the country’s opposition
party may hurt realtors.  
 The shares declined 9.1 percent to close at 4,200 yen on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the largest drop since June 16. Shares
of  Tokyu Livable Inc. (8879) , which also offers property broking and
leasing services, declined 9.8 percent, the biggest fall since
Oct. 17.  
 Daisuke Fukushima, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said
he told investors that property sales companies may be
negatively affected by policies disclosed yesterday by the
 Democratic Party of Japan . Under the plan, the companies would
only get commissions from either sellers or buyers, rather than
from both as they currently do, he said.  
 “It’s still a question if this policy will actually go
into effect,” Fukushima, who does not have a rating on Sumitomo
Real Estate, said today by telephone. “But if it does, it would
mean significant damage to the industry.”
