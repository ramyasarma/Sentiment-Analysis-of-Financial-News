             Hollywood studios led by  Time Warner (TWX) 
Inc. are poised to set a record for ticket sales this year,
rescued by higher prices after films such as ``The Golden
Compass'' failed to halt a post-summer drop in attendance.  
 Sales in the U.S. and  Canada  will climb about 4 percent from
last year to $9.6 billion on a 4.6 percent rise in ticket prices,
box-office tracker  Media By Numbers LLC  said. Time Warner, based
in New York, led the studios with revenue of $1.91 billion,
according to Box Office Mojo LLC.  
 While revenue will surpass the $9.45 billion record set in
2004, attendance was little changed, Media By Numbers said.
Ticket sales dropped in 11 of the past 14 weeks from a year
earlier as  films  including Iraq war dramas ``In the Valley of
Elah'' and ``Redacted'' made less than $2 million each in their
opening weekends. ``Compass,'' a fantasy based on the book by
Phillip Pullman, fell short of analysts' expectations.  
 ``There were some great films, but you add them all together
and they don't amount to one blockbuster,''  Paul Dergarabedian ,
president of Encino, California-based Media By Numbers, said in
an interview.  
 The number of tickets sold this year will be about 1.41
billion, about the same as last year, and down 12 percent from
the record of 1.61 billion in 2002, according to Media By
Numbers. The average ticket price rose to $6.82 from $6.55 in
2006, Dergarabedian said.  
 Through Labor Day  
 Sales and attendance both were up through Labor Day, boosted
by 14 summer sequels including the year's biggest money-maker,
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) 's ``Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.''
The film had global sales of $961 million, according to Box
Office Mojo in Burbank, California. `` Harry Potter  and the Order
of the Phoenix'' was second, generating $938.5 million for  Warner
Bros .  
 Revenue in the U.S., less than half the worldwide total, is
the most reliable benchmark for the industry's health, said Box
Office Mojo President  Brandon Gray . The U.S. is the biggest movie
market and a film's box-office take there is used to set terms
for sales to broadcast and cable-TV networks, he said.  
 ``Domestic box office remains the engine that drives the
train,'' Gray said.  
 The focus on sequels enabled Hollywood to set a summer sales
record as theaters collected $4.18 billion and attendance jumped
3.9 percent, according to Media By Numbers. Admissions have slid
10 percent since Labor Day.  
 More Competition  
 Attendance may continue to be lackluster next year because
of fewer big-budget sequels, as well as competition from the
Internet and video games, said  Tuna Amobi , an analyst with
 Standard & Poor's  in New York.  
 ``We're looking for next year's attendance to be pressured
by a more difficult comparison,'' Amobi said.  
 The 2008 film schedule probably won't be affected by the
Hollywood writers strike because scripts were completed before
the walkout, Amobi said. Members of the Writers Guild of America
walked off the job Nov. 5 in a dispute over pay for the use of
their work in digital media.  
 With growing competition from other media, studios may be
fortunate to do as well as they have, Mark Zoradi, Disney's
distribution and marketing chief, said in an interview.  
 ``In the midst of these huge entertainment alternatives and
big screen televisions, to continue to have similar levels of
admission every year is pretty good,'' Zoradi said.  
 Viacom Inc. (VIAB) , owner of  Paramount Pictures , was second in
sales among top studios with $1.54 billion, followed by Disney
with $1.39 billion, as of Dec. 25, according to Box Office Mojo.  
 Sony Corp. (6758) , based in Tokyo, was fourth with $1.26 billion.
 General Electric Co. (GE) 's  NBC Universal  was fifth with $1.19 billion
and New York-based  News Corp. (NWSA)  was sixth with $1.1 billion.  
 December Record  
 Disney, based in Burbank, California, received a year-end
boost from the Dec. 21 release of ``National Treasure: Book of
Secrets,'' which had sales of $65.4 million during its first five
days in theaters. The film is a sequel to the 2004 adventure tale
``National Treasure,'' which took in $347.5 million worldwide.  
 Time Warner received a similar lift from ``I Am Legend,''
the Will Smith science-fiction film from Warner Bros. The movie,
based on Richard Matheson's book, set a December record for the
U.S. and Canada with $77.2 million in its first weekend.  
 Sister studio New Line wasn't as fortunate with ``The Golden
Compass.'' The film, made for an estimated $180 million, opened
with sales of $25.7 million over the Dec. 7 weekend, according to
Box Office Mojo. Overseas sales helped lift its total to $142.9
million after three weeks.  
 Time Warner slipped 2 cents to $16.65 at 4:01 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, while Disney lost 1 cent
to $32.42. New York-based Viacom gained 26 cents to $43.86.  
 Declining admissions and a larger pool of films probably
will push Hollywood toward more big-budget fare to lure
moviegoers, said producer and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who
won an Academy Award for his screenplay for ``A Beautiful Mind.''
Goldsman produced and co-wrote ``I Am Legend.''  
 Sequels planned for next year include a sixth ``Harry
Potter'' film, Disney's second installment of ``The Chronicles of
Narnia'' and Paramount's revival of the ``Indiana Jones'' films.  
 ``The non-event film is getting harder to rationalize,''
Goldsman said in an interview. ``When you crowd the field so much
it creates a din, and everybody wants to pierce the din.''
