             China's insurance market expanded 24
percent to 253.2 billion  yuan  ($33 billion) in premiums in the
first four months of 2007 from a year earlier, the regulator said.  
 Premiums from life policies rose 19 percent to 164.1 billion
yuan, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a
 statement  posted on its Web site today. Property and casualty
cover generated premiums of 71 billion yuan, up 43 percent.  
 Wu Dingfu , the regulator's chairman, is trying to ease
rules to allow insurance companies to invest their funds more
freely in the stock market to improve their returns. Preparations
are under way to lift a ban that limits insurers' direct
investment in the stock market to 5 percent of assets, he said
April 12.  China 's CSI 300 Index has doubled this year after more
than doubling in 2006.  
 Total assets held by China's insurers were 2.43 trillion
yuan. Insurers had 758.9 billion yuan in bank deposits, up from
634.4 billion yuan in the first three months, and 1.47 trillion
yuan in stocks, bonds and corporate debt, up from 1.41 trillion
yuan in the first three months, the regulator said.
