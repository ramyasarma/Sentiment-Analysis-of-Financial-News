             ZAO Promsvyazbank, a Russian lender
partly owned by Commerzbank AG, agreed a $125 million loan with a
group of three banks from the Middle East and Europe that it will
use to finance trade.  
 The one-year loan was arranged by Brussels-based Fortis with
Emirates Bank International PJSC and Mashreqbank PSC, both of
Dubai, the banks said at a press conference in Dubai, United Arab
Emirates today. Eleven other banks, from countries including
Kuwait, Qatar and Pakistan, contributed to the loan, they said.  
 ``We want to build our business ties with this region,''
 Alexander Levkovskiy , Promsvyazbank's president, said in an
interview after the Dubai conference. ``The liquidity is here and
the political future is clear.''  
 Frankfurt-based Commerzbank agreed in August to buy a stake
in Promsvyazbank for an undisclosed sum to get access to Russia's
surging banking industry. Seeking to benefit from economic growth
in former Soviet states, Emirates Bank last month said it expects
to arrange about $1 billion of loans this year for banks in
countries including Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.  
 Closely held Promsvyazbank's loan will pay interest of 0.7
percentage point more than the three-month dollar London
interbank offered rate, according to the lenders. Three-month
dollar Libor, an average of rates set daily by banks and used as
a borrowing benchmark, is 5.36 percent.
