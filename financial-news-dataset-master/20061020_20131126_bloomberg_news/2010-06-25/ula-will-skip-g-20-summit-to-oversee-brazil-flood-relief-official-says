             Brazilian President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  decided to skip this weekend’s meeting of leaders from
the G-20 group of nations in Toronto after his inspection tour
of the flood ravaged northeastern part of the country.  
 Brazil’s delegation to the G-20 meeting will be headed by
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega , state-run Agencia Brasil
newswire quoted Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim  as saying. Lula
made the choice to stay in Brazil to follow relief efforts in
the Northeast, Agencia Brasil  reported .  
 Lula’s change of plans came after he viewed heavy damage in
Palmares city, Alagoas state, Amorim was quoted by Agencia
Brasil as saying. Heavy rains in the northeastern states of
Alagoas and Pernambuco have left least 51 dead and thousands
homeless, Folha de S.Paulo newspaper  reported  today.  
 “These houses exist for 50 years, 60 years, some even
older than that, then one day nature becomes more nervous and
this misfortune happens to you,” Lula said yesterday to flood
victims in Rio Largo, Alagoas, according to a transcript posted
on the presidential website.  
 Brazil’s federal government will release 500 million reais
($281 million) for relief and rebuilding, Lula said yesterday.  
 Lula’s chosen successor, former Cabinet chief  Dilma Rousseff , overtook opposition candidate  Jose Serra  and has
become the front-runner in October’s election, according to a
poll released by Ibope research institute this week. Rousseff
had the support of 40 percent of those surveyed, versus 35
percent for Serra, the poll showed.  
 Rousseff Support  
 Rousseff’s support rose to 47 percent in the Northeast,
with Serra at 30 percent in the region, the biggest gap in the
country, the poll showed.  
 The Northeast is considered Lula’s political heartland,
after his social policies helped drive up disposable income and
boost consumption in the traditionally poverty-stricken region.  
 Lula’s approval rating is 90 percent in the Northeast,
compared with a record nationwide 85 percent, according to the
poll.  
 Lula planned to tell G20 leaders that economic growth is
“the best medicine” for public account imbalances that
represent the core of the current crisis, presidential spokesman
 Marcelo Baumbach  told reporters yesterday in Brasilia. Countries
should give priority to stimulus measures instead of trying to
create budget surpluses, Baumbach said.
