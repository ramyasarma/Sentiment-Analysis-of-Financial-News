             Trading of bullish  Hasbro Inc. 
options increased to almost 18 times the four-week average on
speculation the world’s second-biggest toymaker remains a
takeover target.  
 More than 7,000 calls giving the right to buy the stock
changed hands as of 4 p.m. New York time as the shares rose 0.3
percent to $43. The  most-active  contracts were August $47.50
calls, which changed hands about 4,500 times, compared with a
total of 28 outstanding contracts before today, indicating that
almost all of today’s trading was initiated by investors
creating new positions.  
 “Today’s option activity suggests that someone believes
the world’s second largest toy maker may still be in play,”
 Patrick Mortimer , director of options trading at Pipeline
Trading Systems LLC in New Hope, Pennsylvania, wrote in a note.  
 Hasbro denied yesterday that it’s in discussions regarding
a possible takeover, saying the board spurned an approach from a
private-equity firm. There are currently no talks about the sale
of the company, Hasbro said in a statement, without identifying
the buyout firm. Providence Equity Partners Inc. was in
discussions with Hasbro as recently as last week before they
ended, according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 The $47.50 strike price is 10 percent higher than today’s
close.
