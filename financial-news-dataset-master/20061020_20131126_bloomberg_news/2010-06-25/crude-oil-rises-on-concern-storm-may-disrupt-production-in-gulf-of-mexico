             Crude oil rose the most in two weeks
on concern the first tropical storm of the hurricane season may
form and disrupt production in the Gulf of Mexico. The gain
accelerated as the dollar weakened against the euro.  
 Oil climbed 3.1 percent after the  National Hurricane Center 
said that a low pressure area located in the Caribbean off
Honduras and Grand Cayman has an 80 percent chance of developing
into a tropical cyclone this weekend and may head into the Gulf.  
 “We always see knee-jerk reactions when storms enter the
Gulf, and there are concerns that storms will damage either
offshore or onshore infrastructure,” said  Addison Armstrong ,
director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut.  
 Crude for August delivery increased $2.35 to settle at
$78.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the
biggest gain since June 9. The contract increased 0.8 percent
this week.  
 The low pressure area between the northern coast of
Honduras and Grand Cayman is likely to become a tropical
depression “at any time later today or Saturday” and may
become a tropical cyclone during the next 48 hours, the
 hurricane center  said at 2 p.m. Miami time today. The system
will reach the Yucatan Peninsula “in a day or two.”  
 About 31 percent, or 1.69 million barrels a day, of U.S.
oil production comes from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico,
according to the Energy Department.  
 Active Season  
 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
 predicted an active hurricane season  with 14 to 23 named storms.
Eight to 14 of those storms are expected to become hurricanes
and three to seven are likely to become major systems with winds
of 111 miles (178 kilometers) per hour.  
 Storms this year may cut 26 million barrels of oil
production in the Gulf, according to Energy Department
estimates.  
 The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.2388 at 3:12 p.m. after
falling as low as 1.2254. A lower U.S. currency versus the euro
bolsters the appeal of crude as an alternative investment.  
 “The dollar is weakening and it seemed to give crude a
little boost,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago.  
 The premium of Nymex crude futures over Brent oil on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange rose to 74 cents a barrel, the
highest level since June 15.  
 “The storm forecast is the main reason why the premium
picked up quite a bit today,” said Flynn. “Nymex is getting
back to its normal premium to the Brent crude.”  
 Brent Oil  
 Brent crude oil for August delivery gained $1.65, or 2.2
percent, to $78.12 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London.  
 Brent may climb toward $90 a barrel after it re-entered a
rising “channel” that will draw prices higher, according to a
technical analysis by Standard Chartered Plc.  
 Crude also climbed as a survey showed confidence among U.S.
consumers rose in June to the highest level since January 2008.  
 The  Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan  final index of
consumer sentiment increased to 76, the highest level since
January 2008, from 73.6 in May. The gauge was projected to rise
to 75.5, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  
 The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,081.07, and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 0.1 percent to 10,166.33.  
 “The consumer sentiment is bullish,” said  Tim Evans , an
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “The oil
market is also relieved to see that the S&P 500 is not sagging
after the GDP number, which was softer than expected.”  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than a 3 percent estimate issued last month,
Commerce Department data showed.  
 GDP Data  
 Gross domestic product was forecast to expand at a 3
percent annual pace, according to the median estimate of 79
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News were split over whether
crude oil prices will rise or fall next week amid mixed economic
reports and ample stockpiles.  
 Sixteen of 47 analysts, or 34 percent, forecast crude will
advance through July 2. Sixteen more respondents predicted that
futures will decline. Fifteen said there will be little change.  
 U.S. stockpiles of crude oil rose 2.02 million barrels to
365.1 million last week, the Energy Department said on June 23.
The increase in inventories left supplies at the highest level
for the period since 1990, according to the report.  
 The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S.  rose by nine
to 583  this week, the highest level since January 1991,
according to Baker Hughes Inc.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 456,708
contracts as of 3:17 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 420,805
contracts yesterday, 46 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.25 million contracts, the
lowest level since Jan. 5.
