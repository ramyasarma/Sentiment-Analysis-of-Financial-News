             Boeing Co. , more than two years
behind schedule in delivering the 787 Dreamliner, said it will
inspect 23 aircraft after discovering that tail parts on some
planes had been improperly installed.  
 All test models will be checked before their next flights
after the discovery of a “workmanship issue” with the
aircraft’s horizontal stabilizers, Chicago-based Boeing said in
a statement yesterday. The stabilizers, which are part of the
tail, keep the aircraft level during flight.  
 Repairs may take as long as eight days for each 787 found
to need work, Boeing said. The company said the inspections
won’t affect the delivery timetable for the twin-engine jet,
which has been slowed by parts shortages, redesigns and a new
manufacturing process that relies more on partsmakers.  
 Inspections are taking about a day or less for each of the
23 airplanes equipped with horizontal stabilizers shipped by
supplier  Finmeccanica SpA’s  Alenia Aeronautica unit,  Scott Fancher , the 787 program manager told reporters on a conference
call today. Two stabilizers have yet to be installed. They will
also be inspected, he said.  
 Boeing has identified which of the inspected planes’ tail
parts need to be fixed, Fancher said while declining to specify
a number. “We have found some that do and some that don’t.”
The flight test program won’t be affected by the inspections and
fixes, he said.  
 Composite-Plastic  
 The Dreamliner is the first jetliner to be built mostly
from composite-plastic materials instead of aluminum. The plane
is more dependent on electricity for controls and other systems,
with power levels five times higher than on Boeing’s 767.  
 Boeing said the affected parts are “improperly installed
shims and the torque of associated fasteners.” Rome-based
Alenia Aeronautica said it was “normal to come across issues
that need to be resolved when components are stress-tested.”  
 The first 787s should be delivered as planned to Japan’s
All Nippon Airways Co. by year’s end, according to the Boeing
statement. The plane’s 860 orders valued at $148 billion have
made the Dreamliner Boeing’s best-selling new model.  
 Boeing  rose $1.34, or 2 percent, to $68.77 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 27 percent this year.
