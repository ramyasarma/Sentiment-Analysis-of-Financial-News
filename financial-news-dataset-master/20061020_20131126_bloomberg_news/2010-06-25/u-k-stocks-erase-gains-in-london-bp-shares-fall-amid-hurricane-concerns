             U.K. stocks erase gains, as BP Plc
dropped amid concerns about hurricanes in the Caribbean.  
 The FTSE 100 Index was little changed at 5,099.56 at 9:19
a.m. in London after earlier rallying as much as 0.6 percent.  
 BP declined 5.2 percent to 308.45 pence, falling for a
sixth day. The first tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season has a 60 percent chance of forming this weekend, with one
computer model indicating it could head into the Gulf of Mexico
where BP has a flotilla of vessels trying to clean up an oil
spill.  
 A collection of thunderstorms was intensifying in the
Caribbean off Honduras and Nicaragua, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said at 2 a.m. Miami time today.
