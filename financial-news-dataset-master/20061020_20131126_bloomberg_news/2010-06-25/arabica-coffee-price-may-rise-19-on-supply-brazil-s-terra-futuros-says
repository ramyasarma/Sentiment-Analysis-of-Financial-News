             Arabica coffee prices may rise 19
percent by January amid tight world supplies and rising demand,
said a coffee trader at Brazil’s largest commodities brokerage.  
 Coffee futures may rally to $2 a pound on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York by the start of next year,  Erick Mello de Figueiredo , a trader at Terra Futuros, said yesterday in an e-
mailed response to questions. Arabica for September delivery
touched $1.765 a pound yesterday, the highest since February
1998, and closed at $1.6875.  
 Stockpiles monitored by ICE fell 27 percent this year to
the lowest since September 2002 as pests and poor weather in two
consecutive crops hurt output in Central America and Colombia,
the world’s second-biggest Arabica producer after Brazil.
Inventories may drop to 1.75 million bags in September and as
low as 800,000 bags in March from 2.2 million now, he said.  
 “Coffee stocks are dropping based on real demand,”
Figueiredo said.
