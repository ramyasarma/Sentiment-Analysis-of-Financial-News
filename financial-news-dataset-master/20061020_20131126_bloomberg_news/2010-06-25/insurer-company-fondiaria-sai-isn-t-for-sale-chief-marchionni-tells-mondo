             Fondiaria-Sai SpA  Chief Executive
Officer  Fausto Marchionni  said the Italian insurer isn’t for
sale, Il Mondo reported citing an interview.  
 The Italian company plans to sell property that would give
the company a gain of at least 150 million euros ($185 million),
the CEO said, according to the weekly magazine. Fondiaria Sai
will only sell its Nuova Liguria unit if it gets
“satisfactory” offers, he said.
