             The Hungarian government and
commercial lenders are still in talks about the details of a
planned tax on the financial industry, a person close to the
government told Bloomberg.  
 Hungary seeks to raise 187 billion forint ($813 million)
from the new levy on banks, insurers and leasing companies this
year to plug  budget  holes, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said on
June 8. Companies and the government are negotiating how the tax
will be administered and paid.  
 The levy will be based on banks’ total assets on Dec. 31,
2009 and will have a rate of between 0.4 percent and 0.5
percent, news website  Index.hu  reported today, without saying
how it obtained the information. The tax, originally planned for
three years, will be in effect for two years, Economy Ministry
State Secretary Zoltan Csefalvay told  Hirszerzo  today.  
 The government and the banks still need to agree on a range
of issues related to the tax, the person familiar with the talks
said. The parties are likely to reach an agreement soon, the
person said.
