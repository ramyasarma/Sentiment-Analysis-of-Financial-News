             Del Mar Asset Management LP sued a
former trader and his new employer, White Bay Advisor USVI LLC,
alleging breach of contract and misappropriation of trading
models.  
 Bret Chesney learned New York-based Del Mar’s trading
models and strategies while working as a senior trader on the
firm’s index-trading desk, Del Mar said in the suit filed today
in New York state Supreme Court. Before he resigned June 16, he
e-mailed proprietary materials reflecting Del Mar’s strategies
and research to his personal and White Bay accounts, according
to the complaint.  
 White Bay, a U.S. Virgin Islands company, wasn’t involved
in index trading before hiring Chesney, who began to actively
trade on the firm’s behalf on June 17, the day after he
resigned, according to the suit.  
 “By virtue of these brazen acts, the defendants have
effectively usurped Del Mar’s index trading business and,
overnight, put White Bay in the index trading business,” Del
Mar said in the complaint.  
 Del Mar sued for breach and interference with Chesney’s
contract, breach of the duty of loyalty, aiding and abetting
that breach, and misappropriation of trade secrets.  
 Elli Ausubel, who answered the telephone at a New York-area
number for White Bay, said the firm had no immediate comment. A
message he took for Chesney wasn’t immediately returned.  
 The case is Del Mar Asset Management LP v. Bret Chesney,
650729/2010, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).
