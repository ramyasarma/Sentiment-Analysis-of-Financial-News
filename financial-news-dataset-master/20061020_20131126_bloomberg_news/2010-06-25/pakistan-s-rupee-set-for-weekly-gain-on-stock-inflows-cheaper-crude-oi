             Pakistan’s rupee was headed for a
weekly gain as stock inflows picked up and a drop in crude oil
prices helped reduce the nation’s import bill.  
 The currency strengthened on each of the five days, its
longest winning streak since April 2009, and overseas investors
pumped a net $14.6 million into Pakistani shares in the first
three days of this week, exceeding weekly tallies for the past
two months. Pakistan imports 80 percent of the oil it uses and
the cost of crude was $76.56 a barrel in recent trading, 0.8
percent less than at the end of last week.  
 “The reduced demand for dollars from oil importers helped
the currency to strengthen,” said  Mustafa Pasha , assistant vice
president and economist at BMA Capital Management Ltd. in
Karachi. “The rupee will remain under pressure as importers
will need as much as $600 million to import oil next week.”  
 The rupee traded at 85.281 per dollar as of 9:35 a.m. in
Karachi, 0.3 percent stronger than at the end of last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The central bank said yesterday its foreign-exchange
reserves as of June 18 were $12 billion, up from $11.9 billion
on June 11.
