             An average of 11.1 million viewers
watched the U.S. soccer team’s first three matches in the 2010
World Cup on English and Spanish language broadcasts, a 68
percent surge over the 2006 edition, Nielsen Co. reported.  
 “Theses ratings demonstrate the remarkable increase of
interest in U.S. soccer over the last four years,” said Stephen
Master, vice president of Nielsen sports, in a statement.  
 The U.S.’s 1-1 tie against England on June 12 attracted
17.1 million viewers for Walt Disney Co’s ABC network and
Univision Communications Inc., Nielsen said. The second game, a
2-2 draw with Slovenia, was watched by 7.5 million on June 18
and the 1-0 victory over Algeria attracted 8.6 million viewers
on June 23 on ESPN Inc. and Univision.  
 “The numbers are even more impressive when you consider
that two of these games were played on weekday mornings, when
many viewers are at work,” Master said. “Although more people
than ever chose to watch live streaming video of the games from
their computers and mobile devices, TV viewing climbed even
higher.”  
 The U.S.’s three matchups in 2006 averaged 6.6 million
viewers, Nielsen reported.  
 The U.S. tomorrow plays Ghana in Rustenburg, South Africa,
for a place in the quarterfinals.
