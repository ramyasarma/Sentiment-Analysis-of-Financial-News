             UTGR Inc., the owner of the Twin
River casino and dog-racing track in Rhode Island, won court
approval of its reorganization plan.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Henry Boroff in Providence signed an
order yesterday, approving the plan that will give first-lien
creditors owed $415 million almost all of the new stock to be
issued as part of the reorganization. Those senior creditors
will also get a $300 million secured note.
