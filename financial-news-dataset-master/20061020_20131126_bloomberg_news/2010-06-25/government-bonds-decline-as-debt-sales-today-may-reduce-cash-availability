             India’s 10-year  bonds  fell, pushing
yields to their highest level in a week, before a sale of 150
billion rupees ($3.2 billion) of government bonds that may
further tighten supplies of cash at banks.  
 The central bank will sell bonds maturing in 2015, 2020,
2027 and 2032 today, part of the government’s record 4.57
trillion rupees  borrowing target  for the fiscal year that began
April 1.  Overnight rates  are at their highest level since March,
increasing the cost of funding to buy bonds.  
 “Liquidity continues to be tight and the auctions may
further pressure short-term rates,” said S. Srikumar, a fixed-
income trader at Corporation Bank in Mumbai.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose three
basis points to 7.60 percent as of 9:41 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.21, or 21 paise per 100-rupee face amount, to 101.36.  
 Banks  borrowed  an average 436 billion rupees ($9.4 billion)
a day from the central bank through its repurchase-auction
window this month, indicating a shortage of cash after license-
fee payments by phone companies. Last month, they lent a daily
average of 328 billion rupees of surplus cash to the RBI.
