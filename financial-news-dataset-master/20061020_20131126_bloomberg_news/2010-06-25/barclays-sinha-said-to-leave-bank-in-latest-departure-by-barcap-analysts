             Barclays Plc currency strategist
 Adarsh Sinha  resigned, according to two people with knowledge of
his departure.  
 Sinha, who was based in London, resigned earlier this
month, according to the people, who declined to be identified
because the move isn’t public. The departure follows that of
 David Woo , the former head of Group of 10 currency research, who
left for Bank of America Corp. in May, and  Steven Englander , who
joined Citigroup Inc. in April after serving as chief U.S.
currency strategist at Barclays Capital.  
 The employee turnover comes after Barclays combined its
staff with  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  personnel following the
acquisition of the bankrupt firm in September 2008. Barclays
Capital’s  Tim Bond  stepped down as head of asset-allocation
strategy and is considering his options both within the bank and
elsewhere, two people familiar with his role said on June 18.  
 “We continue to hire research analysts and replace
analysts who move on,”  Phillippa-Jane Vermoter,  a Barclays
spokeswoman in London, said in an e-mailed message. A call to
Sinha’s mobile phone went unanswered.
