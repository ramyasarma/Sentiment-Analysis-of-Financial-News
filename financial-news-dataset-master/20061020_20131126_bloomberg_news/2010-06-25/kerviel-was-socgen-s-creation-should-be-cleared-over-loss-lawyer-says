             Jerome Kerviel  was a “creation” of
 Societe Generale SA  and should be cleared of charges related to
the bank’s 4.9 billion-euro ($6 billion) loss, the former
trader’s lawyer told a Paris court today.  
 “Jerome Kerviel is not a fraudster,” said  Olivier Metzner , delivering closing arguments for his 33-year-old
client. He “was trained, formatted by Societe Generale,
reformatted if you will. Jerome Kerviel is nothing but the
creation of Societe Generale.”  
 Kerviel is accused of abuse of trust, faking documents and
hacking the bank’s computers. The trading loss occurred as the
bank unwound 50 billion euros in positions he’d built up by
January 2008 and concealed with faked hedges and forged orders.
The court will give its judgment Oct. 5, Judge Dominique Pauthe
said at the end of the trial.  
 “Everything that he did was seen, known and if not
encouraged, allowed,” Metzner said, arguing that while Kerviel
admitted to the deeds upon which the charges are based, they
didn’t qualify as crimes. “That is why I plead for a
dismissal.”  
 Metzner acknowledged that there were grounds for the charge
of hacking, defined as wrongfully entering information into a
computer system. He turned responsibility for Kerviel’s actions
back on the bank. “The bank gave him tacit accord,” he said.  
 Metzner began his arguments with a populist tone,
describing Kerviel as “a young man from Brittany” who arrived
at the bank, “into a world where numbers had no meaning.”  
 Black Suit  
 After Metzner concluded, Kerviel, clad in a black suit and
black shirt with no tie, was called before the panel of three
judges overseeing the trial. He was asked if he had anything to
add. “Nothing,” he replied.  
 The trial has featured more than 30 witnesses, including
Kerviel’s bosses, colleagues and bank controllers.  Daniel Bouton ,  Societe Generale ’s chief executive officer at the time
of the loss, called the former trader’s conduct a
“catastrophe” for the bank.  
 Kerviel faces as long as five years in prison and a
375,000-euro fine.  
 Prosecutor Jean-Michel Aldebert has recommended he be
sentenced to five years in jail, with one year suspended,
calling Kerviel a “destructive genius.”  
 The bank asked to be awarded the 4.9 billion euros it lost
in damages, with lawyer  Jean Veil  saying “we could have asked
for much more.”
