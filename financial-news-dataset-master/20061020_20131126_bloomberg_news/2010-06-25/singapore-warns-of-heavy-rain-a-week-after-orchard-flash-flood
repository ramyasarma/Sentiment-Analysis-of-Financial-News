             Singapore’s  National Environment
Agency  issued a warning of heavy rain with thunder today, a week
after downpours caused the worst flooding of the Orchard Road
shopping district in 26 years.  
 Flash floods may occur in low-lying areas from the heavy
rain and the public should exercise caution, the agency said on
its website. There have been reports of floods in various parts
of Singapore, including Upper Thomson Road, Jalan Boon Lay and
Bukit Timah Road, Channel NewsAsia reported.  
 About 70 people were rescued from buses and cars on June 16
in the worst flooding of the shopping strip since 1984, while no
injuries were reported. The basement of the Liat Towers building
along Orchard Road was inundated, damaging goods in stores
including  RSH Ltd. ’s Massimo Dutti and a  Starbucks Corp.  outlet.  
 A tree fell outside the Orchard Road area, blocking three
of the five lanes and no flood was reported in the district,
according to the  Straits Times  today.  
 During last week’s flooding, almost 100 millimeters of rain
fell in the morning, more than 60 percent of the average monthly
rainfall for June, according to the national water agency. In
the 140 years to 2008, total rainfall in the month of June
averaged 162.2 millimeters.  
 Between 1982 and 2008, Singapore had an average 15 days of
thunderstorms in the month of June.
