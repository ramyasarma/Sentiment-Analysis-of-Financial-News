             Wheat fell the most in three weeks
as U.S. farmers resumed their harvest after rain delays in
Kansas and Oklahoma, the biggest growers of winter varieties.  
 As of June 20, 17 percent of the winter-wheat crop was
collected, ahead of the year-earlier pace of 15 percent, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a June 21  report . In
Kansas, 10 percent was harvested, above the 4 percent total from
a year earlier, USDA data show.  
 “We had lots of harvest delays, but we’re starting to pick
up the pace,” said  Jeff McReynolds , the owner of McReynolds
Marketing and Investments in Hays, Kansas. “It’s not going to
be a great crop, but it’ll be a good crop.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 6.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.71 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest decline since June 4. The most-active contract fell 1.4
percent for the week, bringing this year’s drop to 13 percent,
partly on increased stockpiles.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
