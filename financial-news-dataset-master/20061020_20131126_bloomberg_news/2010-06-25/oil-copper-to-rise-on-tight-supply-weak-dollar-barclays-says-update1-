             Crude-oil and copper prices will see
“modest increases” on supply constraints and because the rise
in the dollar is probably over,  Larry Kantor , the head of
research at Barclays Capital, said today in New York before the
firm released its quarterly global-outlook report.  
 “Supply growth is unlikely to match the expansion in
demand” for crude oil, and global inventories will decline
consistently over the second half of 2010, London-based analyst
 Kevin Norrish  said in the report. “Oil has the best
fundamentals in the energy sector.”  
 Copper will outperform aluminum and zinc over the next few
months on “a substantial global deficit this year,” Norrish
said. “So far this year, there has been very little growth in
mine production with most of the world’s major miners reporting
year-over-year production declines in the first quarter.”  
 Norrish recommended buying the metal “on dips toward
$6,000 a metric ton.” On the London Metal Exchange, copper for
delivery in three months gained 0.1 percent to $6,702.25 a ton
at 11:24 a.m. New York time.  
 Gold, which reached an all-time high last week on “rising
fears of sovereign-debt contagion in the euro area,” will
benefit from inflation concerns after the European debt crisis
eases, he said. Lead, corn and cocoa will also gain in the
second half, while natural gas and sugar will fall, he said.
