               Kenneth R. Feinberg , the government-
appointed administrator of a $20 billion fund to compensate
victims of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, said the
greatest challenge will be to resolve the legitimacy of those
outside the region.  
 In an interview from New Orleans today with Bloomberg’s  Ken Prewitt  and  Tom Keene  on the “Bloomberg Surveillance” radio
program, Feinberg cited the example of a New York restaurant
that claims its business was hurt because it lost access to gulf
seafood.  
 Feinberg said BP management told him, “‘You are
independent. You are not in any way working for BP. You make the
call. We’ll pay the freight.’”  
 Feinberg, who administered a similar fund for families of
victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, was tapped last
week to run the escrow account BP established under pressure
from President  Barack Obama . Rig workers who lost jobs after
Obama imposed a six-month moratorium on drilling will draw from
a fund limited to $100 million, Feinberg said.  
 Feinberg said claims resolutions should not get bogged down
in politics.  
 “I hope I’ll have bipartisan support,” he said. “This is
not really a political issue. These people down here are in
desperate straits.”
