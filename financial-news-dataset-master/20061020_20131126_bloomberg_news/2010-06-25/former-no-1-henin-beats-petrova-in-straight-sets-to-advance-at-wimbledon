             Former world No. 1 Justine Henin of
Belgium reached the fourth round at the Wimbledon tennis
championships with a straight-sets victory over Russia’s Nadia
Petrova.  
 Henin, runnerup at the All England Club in 2001 and 2006,
won 6-1, 6-4 on Centre Court today. Wimbledon is the only one of
the four Grand Slams she hasn’t won.
