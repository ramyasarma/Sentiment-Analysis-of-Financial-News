             Gold rose for a second day in New
York on speculation that a weakening dollar will boost the
appeal of precious metals and raw materials as alternative
assets.  
 The dollar fell for a third day against a basket of six
 major currencies , heading for a weekly loss, as traders trimmed
bets that the U.S. will boost interest rates this year. The
 Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities rose as much as
1.6 percent, led by gasoline, crude oil and copper. Gold reached
an all-time high of $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21, partly on
demand for a haven from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “Gold and the dollar are re-establishing their inverse
relationship,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. “Investors are adjusting to
the Fed’s rate outlook and the amount of liquidity that’s out
there. A lot of assets are looking at a significantly lower
dollar.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August rose $10.30, or 0.8
percent, to $1,256.20 on the Comex in New York, narrowing this
week’s decline to 0.2 percent, the first since mid-May. Earlier,
the metal touched $1,259.50, the highest level in four days.  
 This week, the Federal Reserve kept the U.S. benchmark
 interest rate  between zero and 0.25 percent, where it’s been
since December 2008.  
 Currency Alternative  
 The metal has risen 15 percent in 2010, after posting nine
annual gains, as investors sought an alternative to holding
currencies. Gold also reached records this month in euros,
sterling and Swiss francs.  
 The cost of protecting Greece’s debt from default rose to a
record today. Group of 20 leaders prepared to meet this weekend
in Toronto to discuss Europe’s debt crisis.  
 “Gold rallying is indicative of investor skittishness,”
said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock in Chicago. “We still have debt overseas and an
economic slowdown. Investors are uncomfortable holding paper
assets.”  
 Silver futures for September delivery gained 37.6 cents, or
2 percent, to $19.152 an ounce on the Comex. Platinum futures
for October delivery rallied $6.30, or 0.4 percent, to $1,574.50
an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Palladium futures
for September delivery rose $7.90, or 1.7 percent, to $477.90 an
ounce.
