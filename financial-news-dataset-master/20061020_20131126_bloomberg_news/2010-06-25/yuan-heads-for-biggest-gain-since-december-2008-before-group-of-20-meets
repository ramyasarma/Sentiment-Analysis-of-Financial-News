             The yuan headed for its biggest
weekly gain since December 2008 as China set the currency’s
daily reference rate at a record, allowing appreciation before
the Group of 20 meeting.  
 The yuan’s spot rate climbed 0.14 percent to 6.79 per
dollar and rallied 0.53 percent this week. The central bank
fixed the currency at 6.7896 per dollar, 0.3 percent stronger
than yesterday and 0.15 percent higher than the close in the
spot market. The yuan is allowed to trade 0.5 percent either
side of the daily fixing.
