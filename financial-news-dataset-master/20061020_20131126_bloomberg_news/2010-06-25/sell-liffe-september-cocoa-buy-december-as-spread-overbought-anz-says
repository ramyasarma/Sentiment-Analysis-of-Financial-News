             Investors should sell the September
contract and buy December for cocoa in London as “the spread is
overbought,” said  Scott Briggs , an agricultural commodities
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  
 The September contract closed at 2,436 pounds a metric ton
($3,639) yesterday, while the December contract closed at 2,275
pounds a ton.  
 This “is a good trade given the extreme overbought
position of this spread,” he said by e-mail. “However, any
significant pullbacks, to 90 pounds a ton and below, are “worth
buying as protection against further flat price spikes.”  
 The spread hasn’t fallen below 90 pounds since June 18.  
 Cocoa in London has advanced 13 percent this year.
