             KB Home , the U.S. homebuilder that
targets first-time buyers, said its quarterly loss narrowed as
the company increased the number of houses delivered for the
first time in more than three years.  
 The net loss was $30.7 million, or 40 cents a share, for
the fiscal second quarter, compared with a loss of $78.4
million, or $1.03, a year earlier, KB Home said in a statement
today. Analysts predicted a loss of 31 cents a share, according
to the average of 17  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey. KB Home’s
building revenue fell 2.7 percent to $372.5 million.  
 Purchases of new U.S. homes fell last month to the lowest
level since records dating to 1963 after a federal tax credit of
as much as $8,000 expired, the Commerce Department said this
week. KB Home has been trying to win business amid the housing
slump with its Open Series houses, which are smaller, less
expensive and bring higher profit margins than older designs.  
 The average price of a KB Home house fell 4 percent from a
year earlier to $207,900, the company said.  
 The builder recorded no asset impairments or charges for
abandoning land-option contracts, compared with $49.5 million of
such charges in the same three-month period of 2009.
