             BNP Paribas SA said  George Nunn  will
assume the foreign-exchange sales responsibilities of  Garry Popofsky  after he resigned from the securities firm.  
 Nunn, a managing director based in New York, will retain
his role as head of interest-rate and currency structuring for
the Americas. In addition, he will be head of currency and
emerging-market sales for the Americas. Popofsky has left the
bank, said  Edwina Frawley-Gangahar , a New York-based BNP
spokesman, without commenting on why he departed.  
 “George has many years of fixed-income experience,”
Frawley-Gangahar said. “He also has tremendous experience in
options trading and structuring and is an accomplished leader on
the fixed-income floor.”  
 Nunn joined BNP in May 2007 from HSBC Holdings Plc,
according to Frawley. He previously worked at BNP in London and
New York from 1991 to 2000.
