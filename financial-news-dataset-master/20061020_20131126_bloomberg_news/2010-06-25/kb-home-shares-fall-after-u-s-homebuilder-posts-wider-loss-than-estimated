             KB Home , the U.S. homebuilder that
targets first-time buyers, tumbled the most in a year in New
York trading after reporting a wider-than-estimated loss and a
drop in new orders.  
 The net loss was $30.7 million, or 40 cents a share, for
the fiscal second quarter, compared with a loss of $78.4
million, or $1.03, a year earlier, KB Home said in a statement
today. Analysts predicted a loss of 31 cents a share, according
to the average of 17  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey. The stock
slid 9 percent, the most since June 2009.  
 U.S. builders are reporting falling sales as homebuyers
retreat from making purchases after the expiration of a
government tax credit at the end of April. KB Home cited the end
of the incentive and an overall weak economy as reasons for its
23 percent decline in new orders.  
 “The tax credit, it pulled forward demand from May and
June,”  Evan Fox , an analyst with Olympia Capital Markets Group,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop
With  Betty Liu .”  
 Purchases of new U.S. homes fell last month to the lowest
level since records dating to 1963, the Commerce Department said
this week. Los Angeles-based KB Home has been trying to win
business amid the housing slump with its Open Series houses,
which are smaller, less expensive and bring higher profit
margins than older designs.  
 Shares, Revenue Fall  
 “Homebuyers who missed the deadline seemed to step out of
the market completely,” KB Home Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Mezger  said today in a conference call with analysts and
investors. It’s too early in the third quarter to forecast
homebuyer demand for the period, he said.  
 “It’s a matter of when, not if, things are going to
improve,” he said.  
 Lennar Corp., the third-largest U.S. homebuilder by
revenue, said yesterday that its home sales are down 20 percent
to 25 percent this month compared with a year earlier because of
the tax credit expiration.  Toll Brothers Inc. , the biggest
luxury-home builder, reported last week that orders were running
about 20 percent behind year-earlier levels since its May 26
earnings release.  
 “A lack of predictability in the overall sales environment
will likely impact our full year deliveries and could
potentially extend our outlook for profitability by a quarter or
two,” Mezger said. He had said in March that KB Home “is
positioned to return to profitability” later this year.  
 The timing depends on orders in the next eight to 10 weeks,
Mezger said on the call today.  
 Worst Performer  
 KB Home  fell $1.10 to $11.12 at 4:03 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the lowest value since March 2009.
The shares have declined 25 percent over the past year, the
 worst  performance in the Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite
Homebuilding Index of 12 companies.  
 KB Home’s building revenue fell 2.7 percent to $372.5
million in the quarter ended May 31. The average price of a KB
Home house declined 4 percent from a year earlier to $207,900,
the company said.  
 The builder recorded no asset impairments or charges for
abandoning land-option contracts, compared with $49.5 million of
such charges in the same three-month period of 2009.  
 KB Home’s backlog, an indicator of future revenue, dropped
19 percent to $648.2 million.  
 The number of homes delivered rose 1.2 percent, the first
year-over-year increase in 14 quarters, the company said.  
 The company had $1.09 billion in cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash at the end of the quarter. Its debt totals $1.76
billion.
