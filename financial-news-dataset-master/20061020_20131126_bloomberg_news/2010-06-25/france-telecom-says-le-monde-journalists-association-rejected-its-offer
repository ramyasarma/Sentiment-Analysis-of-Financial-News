             France Telecom SA’s Orange unit said
the Le Monde journalists’ association rejected the bid it made
with partners Promotora de Informaciones SA and the Nouvel
Observateur Group, for control of the newspaper.  
 “Following the Supervisory Board meeting of Le Monde on
Monday, the group will examine the next steps that could be
taken regarding this project,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 The journalists’ association, the newspaper’s biggest
shareholder, rejected Orange’s bid in favor of a rival offer
from businessman Pierre Berge, Lazard banker Matthieu Pigasse
and Iliad SA founder Xavier Niel.
