             Prudential Financial Inc. , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, raised 150 million pounds
($225 million) to invest in European commercial real estate debt
after other lenders scaled back.  
 Prudential will finance borrowers who seek funds for
property acquisitions between 10 million pounds and 300 million
pounds, the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer said in a  statement 
on the company’s website today. The company will also work with
banks to refinance existing loans, investing in the U.K. or
Germany and sidestepping debt that is distressed or securitized.  
 Prudential is seeking to take advantage of income-producing
properties whose owners are shut off from usual sources of
financing. The insurer is betting on a commercial real estate
rebound, and said last month that the prospect of increased
 property values  in the U.S. makes mortgage originations an
attractive business.  
 “The dramatic shortage of debt capital in the commercial
real estate markets has created significant borrower demand,”
 Jack Taylor , manager of global high yield debt initiatives at
Prudential’s real estate investment arm, said in the statement.  
 MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life insurer, said April 30
there are signs of a recovery in commercial real estate markets
after property values dropped about 40 percent from their peak.
