             Savion Glover  calls his latest show
“Sole Power.” The silly wordplay suits a virtuoso who has been
turning his art inside out for 25 very public years. Since his
first Broadway bow, in “The Tap Dance Kid,” Glover has moved
his dizzy-making footwork from dazzling display to a more
introspective style that has been compared with the later work
of  Miles Davis , who had a habit of performing with his back to
the audience. One minute he’s a crowd pleaser; the next it’s as
if he couldn’t care less. With each subsequent summer fling at
the  Joyce Theater , Glover challenges his audience further with
his elliptical, moody transitions, and “Sole Power” continues
the trend.  
 Afterward, have ribs or jelly cupcakes at Hill Country.  
 “ Sole Power ” is at 175 Eighth Ave., at 19th Street.
Information: +-212-242-0800;  http://www.joyce.org .  
 Hill Country is at 30 W. 26th St.; +1-212-255-4544.  
 Saturday Matinee  
 French-Cambodian choreographer Emmanuele Phuon takes the
Khmer classical dance vocabulary and transforms it -- twisting
it, injecting moves and floor work from ballet -- to suggest a
continuing struggle between present and past.  
 With music by Debussy and Ravel, “Khmeropedies I & II,” a
solo and a dialogue between a teacher rooted in traditions and
her three more modern-thinking students, is being presented this
week by Cambodia-based  Amrita Performing Arts , whose executive
director, Fred Frumberg, has done miracles to revive the
country’s traditional dance forms.  
 Afterward, head to Don’s Bogam for some of New York’s best
Korean barbecue.  
 “Khmeropedies I & II” is at the  Baryshnikov Arts Center ,
450 W. 37th St., at 2 p.m. and 7:30. Information: +1-646-731-
3200;  http://www.bacnyc.org .  
 Don’s Bogam is at 17 E. 32nd St.; +1-212-683-2200.  
 Saturday Night  
 Beethoven  considered the Missa Solemnis his greatest work,
and maybe you will too once you hear the New York Philharmonic
perform the piece with a mighty fine quartet of soloists:
 Christine Brewer , Jane Henschel, Anthony Dean Griffey and Eric
Owens. Add to them a full chorus and maestro  Alan Gilbert  and
you’ve got a “Gloria” to knock your socks off.  
 Opening the program is the world premiere of “Al Largo”
by composer in residence Magnus Lindberg. He writes energetic,
melodically inventive work for lots of busy little fingers.  
 You’ve fed your soul; now show your stomach a good time
with lemon chicken and crisp pan-fried zucchini at Cafe
Fiorello.  
 Avery Fisher Hall is on Broadway at 65th St. Information:
+1-212-875-5656;  http://nyphil.org .  
 Cafe Fiorello is at 1900 Broadway, between 63rd and 64th
Streets. Information: +1-212-595-5330.  
 Sunday Night  
 Not surprisingly,  Al Pacino ’s foray as Shylock in “The
Merchant of Venice” is drawing crowds to  Free Shakespeare in
the Park . Don’t let that dissuade you from taking the
opportunity to see “The Winter’s Tale,” running in rotating
repertory -- and playing tonight -- at the Delacorte Theatre.
Shakespeare’s soulful late romance is a parable of love and
forgiveness where, in contrast with Shylock’s brutal fate, the
quality of mercy truly is not strained.  
 For waiting on line, bring a shake and burger from the
 Shake Shack .  
 For the Delacorte Theater, enter Central Park at Central
Park West and 81st St. or Fifth Ave. and 79th St. Information:
+1-212-539-8750.  
 Shake Shack is at 366 Columbus Ave. at 77th St.
