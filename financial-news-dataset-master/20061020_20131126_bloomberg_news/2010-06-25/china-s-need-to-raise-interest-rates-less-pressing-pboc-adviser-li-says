             The need for China to raise interest
rates is less pressing now that inflation expectations are
easing, Li Daokui, an adviser to the People’s Bank of China,
said in Shanghai today.  
 “The goal of raising interest rates is to manage inflation
expectations,” he told reporters at a conference. “If
inflation expectations are easing, even though inflation is
rising by more than 3 percent, there is no basis for a rate
increase.”  
 Li said inflation expectations are not as strong as they
were a couple of months ago before the Chinese stock markets
declined. “This should be a new factor to be taken into
consideration” in any decision to raise interest rates, he
said.
