             Administrators for  IT Holding SpA ,
the Italian fashion company being reorganized under government-
backed bankruptcy protection, agreed to sell the Malo cashmere
brand to retail developer Evanthe Srl.  
 Italy’s  Industry Ministry  must still authorize the sale,
 Andrea Ciccoli , one of IT Holding’s three administrators, said
today in a phone interview. He gave no other details.  
 Malo posted a net loss of 10.6 million euros ($13 million)
on sales of 54.1 million euros in 2007, according to IT
Holding’s  annual report . Ciccoli and co-administrators  Roberto Spada  and  Stanislao Chimenti  had been considering four bids for
the unit from unidentified Italian suitors since June 3.  
 IT Holding , which is based in Milan, sought protection from
creditors in February 2009. The company is also auctioning its
 Gianfranco Ferre  fashion label and Ittierre production division.
Binding offers for Ferre must be submitted by July 6, while
bidders for Ittierre, which makes clothing under license for
 Roberto Cavalli  and  John Galliano , have an Aug. 2 deadline.
