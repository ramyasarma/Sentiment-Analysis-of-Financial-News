             Vallar Plc, the investment vehicle
of  Nathaniel Rothschild , plans to raise 600 million pounds ($897
million) selling shares and listing on the London Stock Exchange
to fund acquisitions in the “compelling” commodities industry.  
 Vallar will place shares at 10 pounds each to buy a “major
business or significant operational asset” in mining or metals,
publishing a prospectus on around July 8, the Jersey, U.K.-
incorporated investment business said today in a statement.  
 The company will seek assets with an enterprise value,
often used as a proxy for their takeover value, of as much as 5
billion pounds, said two people familiar with the matter who
declined to be identified because the plans aren’t public.  
 Rothschild, former co-president of Atticus Capital LLC and
the only son of British financier  Lord Jacob Rothschild , is
tapping investors after at least 47 initial public offerings
were shelved worldwide since March. Ferrous Resources Ltd., the
iron-ore company seeking funds for a Brazilian mine, pulled its
$400 million London stock sale this month.  
 Mining companies led a slump in equity markets since April,
after metal prices stumbled and Australia, the world’s biggest
exporter of iron ore and coal, announced plans to introduce a
new tax on mining company profits from 2012. Xstrata Plc, BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group have all lost more than 19
percent in London trading from their high for the year reached
on April 6, outpacing the FTSE 100 Index’s drop of 12 percent.

 “This is a theme of consolidation amongst the majors to
focus on their core assets and organic growth,”  Richard Knights , an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London, said by
phone. “That potentially creates an opportunity for Vallar.”  
 The Vallar team is led by Rothschild and  James Campbell , a
former head of Anglo American Plc’s coal and base-metals
division. Investment will focus on metals, coal and iron ore in
the Americas, Russia, eastern Europe and Australia, it said.
“The fundamentals of the commodities sector make a compelling
case for investment,” Rothschild said in the statement.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. are joint
bookrunners for the placing. Evolution Securities Ltd. and
Liberum Capital Ltd. are co-managers.  
 Rothschild, the youngest of four children of Jacob
Rothschild, ranks seventh in the Sunday Times list of the 25
wealthiest U.K.-based hedge fund managers in an annual estimate
of net worth known as the “Rich List.”  
 He has an estimated fortune of 330 million pounds,
according to the list published in April.  
 Edward Simpkins, a Vallar spokesman in London, declined to
comment on the value of assets the fund is seeking.
