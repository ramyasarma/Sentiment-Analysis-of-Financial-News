             German Labor Minister  Ursula von der Leyen  called on billionaire Nicolas  Berggruen  and the Highstreet
partnership to come to an agreement on Karstadt rents that
safeguards the future of the department store chain’s workers.  
 Insolvency procedures have to be approved by mid-July, so
“time is running out,” Von der Leyen told reporters in Berlin
today after talks with union representatives. “The problems are
almost all solved.”  
 Berggruen beat two other bidders for Karstadt this month
with a promise to maintain the department stores and jobs. The
investor has said the bid was conditional on negotiating lower
rents with the Highstreet partnership, which owns most of
Karstadt’s real estate, and discussions are progressing.  
 There isn’t yet any agreement in sight with Berggruen, a
spokesman for Highstreet said in a telephone interview, adding
that talks are ongoing.  
 Berggruen, who invests in real estate around the world and
has no previous retail experience, said he will bring U.S.
fashion company BCBG Max Azria Group as a strategic partner for
sourcing and merchandising in Karstadt’s operations.  Maurizio Borletti , a co-investor in Highstreet, has sent a letter to Von
der Leyen in which he criticizes Berggruen’s business plan,
Frankfurter Rundschau reported yesterday, citing the document.  
 “Time is running out,” Von der Leyen said. “The problems
are almost all solved and behind this there are 55,000 people
and their families. That’s the goal here.”
