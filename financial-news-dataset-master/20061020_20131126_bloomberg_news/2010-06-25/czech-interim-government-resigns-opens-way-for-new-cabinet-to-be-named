             Czech Prime Minister  Jan Fischer ’s
interim government resigned, opening the way for President
 Vaclav Klaus  to name a new administration following May general
elections.  
 Klaus accepted the resignation at a ceremony in Prague
today. According to the constitution, Fischer’s Cabinet will
stay in office until a new government is appointed. The three
parties that won a combined majority in the May 28-29 elections,
the Civic Democrats, TOP09 and Public Affairs, have said they
want to finish talks on forming a coalition by July 10.  
 On June 4, Klaus asked  Petr Necas , the leader of the Civic
Democrats, the strongest party in the coalition talks, to head
up negotiations on creating the new government. Necas is the
Civic Democrats’ candidate for prime minister.  
 The three parties have pledged to restore fiscal prudence
after the public finance shortfall widened to 5.9 percent of
gross domestic product last year, almost double the 3 percent
limit for joining the euro area.  
 The parties have yet to agree on the division of seats in
the Cabinet,  Petr Tluchor , the head of the Civic Democrat’s
parliamentary caucus, said after talks today.
