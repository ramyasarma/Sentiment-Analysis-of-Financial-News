             Brazil’s Bovespa stock index
fluctuated between gains and losses as an advance in oil prices
boosted producers, offsetting a metals retreat.  
 OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA climbed as much as 1.4
percent as crude prices increased on concern the first tropical
storm of the Atlantic hurricane season may form and disrupt
production in the Gulf of Mexico. Gerdau SA, Latin America’s
biggest steelmaker, retreated as speculation the world economic
rebound may falter dragged down metals prices.  
 The Bovespa index lost 0.1 percent to 63,877.01 at 9:55
a.m. New York time after gaining as much as 0.5 percent. Thirty-
four stocks rose on the index while 27 fell. The Bovespa dropped
the most in almost three weeks yesterday after a report showed
domestic unemployment unexpectedly rose in May and on renewed
concern that Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.
