             German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said his government would accept another non-German as
head of the European Central Bank.  
 Germany “has accepted it in any case since the creation of
the ECB and we haven’t had any reason to complain. The important
thing is that the ECB remains independent,” he said, according
to an interview published in the Le Monde newspaper.  
 Schaeuble also said there no real differences between
member countries ahead of the G-20 meeting in Canada, Le Monde
reported.
