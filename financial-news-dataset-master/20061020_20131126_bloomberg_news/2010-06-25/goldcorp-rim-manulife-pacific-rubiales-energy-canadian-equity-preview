             Canadian stocks  rose, trimming a
weekly loss, as gold producers rose on demand for a haven from
Europe’s debt crisis and crude oil surged after weather
forecasters said a tropical storm may form this weekend.  
 Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
advanced 3.3 percent. Research In Motion Ltd., the BlackBerry
maker, sank 11 percent after reporting first-quarter revenue 2.5
percent below the  average analyst forecast . EnCana Corp.,
Canada’s biggest natural gas producer, increased 2.4 percent
after announcing a potential joint venture.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 37.67
points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,707.85.  
 “You’ve seen gold going higher on uncertainty,” said  Todd Johnson , who helps oversee about C$215 million ($207 million) as
a money manager at BCV Asset Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
“Everyone is factoring in that Greece is going to restructure,
but how that affects other countries is unknown.”  
 The S&P/TSX completed its biggest  weekly  drop since May 21,
having declined 1.8 percent as sales of new and existing U.S.
homes failed to meet economists’ estimates and speculation of a
European sovereign debt default increased.  
 The  S&P/TSX Gold Index  reached a six-month high after the
cost to insure Greek government bonds against default rose to a
record. Futures climbed 0.8 percent to $1,256.20 an ounce in New
York.  
 Barrick, Goldcorp  
 Barrick rose for a fourth day, gaining 3.3 percent to
C$48.08. Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s  second-largest  gold producer,
advanced 2.2 percent to C$47.10. Silver reseller Silver Wheaton
Corp. surged 5.5 percent to a record C$22.15.  
 Crude futures rallied the most in two weeks after the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said a low pressure area in the
Caribbean has a 70 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone
this weekend.  
 Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the country’s second-
biggest energy company by market value, climbed 0.7 percent to
C$36.71. Talisman Energy Inc., an oil and gas producer with
operations in North America, the North Sea and Indonesia, rose
1.1 percent to C$17.25.  
 EnCana gained for the first time in six days, rallying 2.4
percent to C$34.03. The company said it may form a joint venture
with China National Petroleum Corp. to exploit shale gas
formations in British Columbia.  
 Such a partnership would “accelerate resources definition
and value for EnCana,” Macquarie Group Ltd. analyst  Chris Theal 
said in a note to clients.  
 Estimates Cut  
 RIM plunged 11 percent to a 15-month low of C$54.08, even
though its profit topped the average of 44 analysts by 3.1
percent, excluding certain items. At least  15 analysts  cut their
12- or nine-month price estimate for the shares.  
 Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst  William V. Power  reduced his
rating on the stock to “neutral” from “outperform,” telling
clients he expects RIM to lose market share to Apple Inc.’s
iPhone and devices running Google Inc.’s Android operating
system.  
 “New BlackBerry devices may help, but we increasingly feel
it may be too little, too late to turn the tide in the U.S.,”
Power wrote in a note.  
 Financial shares fell after the U.S. Commerce Department
said the U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual pace in the
first quarter. The government had estimated a 3 percent gain in
gross domestic product last month.  
 Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada’s fifth-largest
bank, slipped 1.9 percent to C$71 for a fourth-straight decline.
Bank of Nova Scotia, the country’s No. 3 bank by assets,
declined 0.5 percent to C$50.18. Financial holding company Power
Corp. of Canada lost 1 percent to C$26.36.  
 Many financial professionals left Toronto in advance of
this weekend’s Group of 20 summit. Today’s Toronto Stock
Exchange  volume  was the lowest for a Friday in 11 months.
