             Russia’s government plans to raise 
at least 7 billion rubles ($225 million) selling the rights to 
develop the Naulsk oil fields in the Arctic, Vedomosti said, 
citing the Federal Subsoil Agency.  
 The fields hold an estimated 52.1 million tons (382 million
barrels) of oil, making it the biggest auction in five years, 
the Moscow-based newspaper said today. OAO Rosneft and OAO 
Gazprom Neft may bid for the licenses at the Sept. 22 sale, the
newspaper said.
