             Roger Federer  and  Venus Williams  won
third-round matches at Wimbledon, and  Kim Clijsters  and  Justine Henin  set up a meeting of former top-ranked tennis players.  
 Federer, a six-time champion from Switzerland, beat  Arnaud Clement  of France 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 today on Centre Court. Williams,
a five-time winner from the U.S., defeated  Alisa Kleybanova  of
Russia 6-4, 6-2.  
 “It was a good and solid match for me, clean, hardly any
errors, good on the offensive,” Federer said at a news
conference. “I’m very happy with my game right now.”  
 Clijsters, playing at Wimbledon for the first time since
2006, beat Russia’s  Maria Kirilenko  6-3, 6-3. Henin, a
semifinalist in her most recent appearance in 2007, defeated
 Nadia Petrova  of Russia 6-1, 6-4. The Belgians will meet for the
25th time on June 28.  
 “It’s a great opportunity for both of us,” Henin, the
17th seed, said in a news conference. “It’s going to be very
interesting, very exciting.”  
 Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands beat American  John Isner  6-0, 6-3, 6-2 in a second-round match. Isner yesterday
completed a first-round contest with  Nicolas Mahut  of France
that lasted 11 hours, 5 minutes over three days.  
 “I was obviously a bit drained,” Isner said at a news
conference. “I just didn’t have much in the way of my legs. I
was low on fuel out there early. Didn’t really have a chance.”  
 Break Points  
 Federer saved his only break point against Clement, while
breaking his opponent’s serve five times. The Swiss made 11
unforced errors, to 20 for Clement, and won in 95 minutes.  
 Austrian  Jurgen Melzer , the No. 16 seed, is up next for
Federer after he beat Spain’s  Feliciano Lopez  in four sets.  
 Williams fell behind 3-1 before winning five of the final
six games in the first set. She then broke Kleybanova’s serve
three times in winning the second set.  
 “She was competing well, I was competing well,” Williams
said in a news conference. “There were some games that went
close. But thankfully I got most of them.”  
 Williams next meets unseeded Australian  Jarmila Groth , a
straight-set winner over Germany’s Angelique Kerber.  
 Clijsters and Henin both retired from the sport before
making comebacks in 2009 and 2010. Neither has won the title at
the All England Club, with Henin winning their only meeting
there in the 2006 semifinals.  
 Clijsters won the U.S. Open for the second time in the
third tournament of her return last year. Henin is a seven-time
Grand Slam winner. Each has won 12 times in their meetings.  
 No Aces  
 Isner returned to the court less than 24 hours after
winning the final set 70-68 against Mahut. The 23rd seed, who
hit a record 112 aces against Mahut, didn’t have one today
against the 49th-ranked Dutchman.  
 De Bakker will next play France’s  Paul-Henri Mathieu , who
beat No. 13  Mikhail Youzhny  of Russia in five sets today. Isner
was forced to withdraw from his doubles match scheduled for
later today with partner  Sam Querrey  because of a toe injury.  
 Third-seeded  Novak Djokovic  of Serbia won 6-1, 6-4, 6-4
over Spaniard  Albert Montanes . He next meets 2002 champion
 Lleyton Hewitt  of Australia, who beat  Gael Monfils  of France 6-
3, 8-6 (11-9), 6-4.  
 Andy Roddick  had 28 aces in beating  Philipp Kohlschreiber 
of Germany 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-3. The fifth-seeded American
held off all seven break points he faced and broke the 29th seed
four times.  
 Roddick next meets Taiwan’s Yen-Hsun Lu, who advanced after
 Florian Mayer  quit their match trailing by two sets and 0-2.  
 Women’s No. 4  Jelena Jankovic  beat Anna Bondarenko of
Ukraine to advance to a fourth-round meeting with 21st seed  Vera Zvonareva  of Russia, who beat 15th-seeded Yania Wickmayer of
Belgium 6-4, 6-2.  
 No. 11  Marion Bartoli  of France beat Greta Arn of Hungary
in two sets and will face Bulgaria’s Tsvetana Pironkova, who was
leading 6-4, 2-0 when Russia’s Regina Kulikova quit their match.
