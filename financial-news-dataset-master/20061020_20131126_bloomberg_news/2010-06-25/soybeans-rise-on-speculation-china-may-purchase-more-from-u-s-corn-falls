             Corn fell for the fifth straight day
on speculation that cool, dry weather in the U.S. Great Plains
will boost crop prospects. Soybeans were unchanged.  
 As of June 20, 75 percent of U.S. fields were in good or
excellent condition, up from 70 percent at the same time a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said this week in a
 report . High temperatures in parts of Iowa, the biggest U.S.
corn producer, are expected to top out at 86 degrees Fahrenheit
(30 Celsius) next week. Corn prices fell 5.3 percent this week.  
 “We’re looking at less rain in the forecast,” McReynolds
said. “The northern Corn Belt needs some dry weather, and
they’re supposed to get it. And it’s not going to be
particularly hot, either.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 4 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.6305 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has declined 13 percent this year.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery were unchanged at
$9.12 a bushel in Chicago and fell 2 percent for the week. The
price has declined 2.7 percent this month.  
 Soybeans had been up on speculation that China would buy
more from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, as dry weather
threatens the Asian nation’s crop. Futures may have given up
their gains on forecasts of favorable weather.
