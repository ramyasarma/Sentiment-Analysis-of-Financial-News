             Fujian Nanfang Textile Co., a
textile manufacturer, dropped to a 20-month low in Shenzhen
on concern flood damage will reduce earnings.  
 Fujian Nanfang declined 2.3 percent to 5.60 yuan as of
2:13 p.m. local time, heading for its lowest since October
2009. The company has a loss of 430 million yuan from a storm
in the southern part of the country that damaged factories
and blocked transport, according to an announcement to the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Its stock was suspended from June 21
to 24.  
 Heavy rains have killed at least 211 people and caused
43.3 billion yuan of economic losses, according to a
statement by the Ministry of Civil Affairs on June 23.  
 Fujian Sunner Development, a poultry processing company,
dropped 2.3 percent to 30.45 yuan. Fujian Cement, a local
manufacturer of the building material, said it has a loss of
over 20 million yuan from damages caused by the storm. The
company’s shares were suspended in Shenzhen today due to a
shareholders’ meeting.
