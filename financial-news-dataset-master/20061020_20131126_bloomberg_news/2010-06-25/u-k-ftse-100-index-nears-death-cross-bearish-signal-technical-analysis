             The  FTSE 100 Index  completed a so-
called death cross, a bearish signal that may foreshadow a
further drop in the benchmark gauge for U.K. stocks, according
to the head of technical analysis at Mint Equities Ltd.  
 This week’s decline has pulled the index’s 50-day moving
average down to 5,314.15, below the 200-day moving average of
5,328.31. The last time the FTSE 100 formed a death cross
pattern, where the 50-day average drops below the 200-day
average, was in December 2007, as U.K. stocks began a 45 percent
slump through March 2009.  
 “The short-term trend is clearly down,” Mint’s London-
based analyst  Geoff Wilkinson  said in a phone interview. “We
are drifting into quite tricky waters. The door could close
quite quickly if people decide to take money off the table.”  
 The  FTSE 100  fell 1.1 percent to 5,046.47 today, bringing 
this week’s loss to 3.9 percent. The measure has dropped 13 
percent from this year’s high on April 15 on concern that 
Europe’s debt crisis will curb economic growth and as BP Plc 
lost more than a third of its value following an oil spill 
in the Gulf of Mexico. The gauge still remains 44 percent 
higher than in March 2009 amid signs the  global economy is 
rebounding.
