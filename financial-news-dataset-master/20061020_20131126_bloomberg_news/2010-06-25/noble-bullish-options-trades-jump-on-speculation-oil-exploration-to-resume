             Trading of bullish  Noble Corp. 
options jumped to a two-year high on speculation that the
world’s third-largest oil drilling contractor will rally on a
revised U.S. offshore drilling ban that allows more exploration.  
 More than 42,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands,
seven times the four-week  average  and 10 times the number of
puts giving the right to sell shares. Geneva-based Noble gained
2.9 percent to $29.28 in New York Stock Exchange trading to pare
this year’s loss to 28 percent. The  most-active options  were
July $30 calls, which rose 80 percent to $1.10 and accounted for
almost three-quarters of call trades.  
 “Our  analysts  have been checking and they have some
confidence that the Interior Department will announce that
developmental drilling is going to be allowed as part of the new
iteration of the moratorium,” said  Tom Rinaldi , the energy desk
strategist at Jefferies Group Inc. in New York. “Noble is one
of the drillers with the most to gain from that.”  
 U.S. Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  said June 23 that the
Obama administration may let certain deep-water drilling
operations in the Gulf of Mexico resume during a six-month halt.
Rules to be issued “will include the criteria under which it is
appropriate to take a look at the lifting of the moratoria,”
Salazar said at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing.  
 Larger rival Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. climbed 3.1
percent to $61.72, while call option volume was below average.
Transocean Ltd. increased 2 cents to $49.77.
