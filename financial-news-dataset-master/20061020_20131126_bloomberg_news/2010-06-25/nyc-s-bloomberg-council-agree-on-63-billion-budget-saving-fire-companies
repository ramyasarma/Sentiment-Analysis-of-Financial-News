             New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  and
the City Council agreed on a $63 billion  budget  for the most
populous U.S. city that reduces funds for schools, libraries and
social services while saving about 20 fire companies slated for
closure.  
 Bloomberg and Council Speaker  Christine Quinn  shook hands
in the City Hall rotunda to seal the accord for fiscal year
2011, which begins July 1. After a month of negotiation, the
budget restored some funds cut from agencies, community
organizations and services the mayor had proposed to close.  
 The plan requires formal council approval with a vote
scheduled June 28. The mayor is founder and majority owner of
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.
