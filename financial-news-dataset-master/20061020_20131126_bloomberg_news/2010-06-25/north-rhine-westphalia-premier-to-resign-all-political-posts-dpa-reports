             The prime minister of North Rhine-

step down from all political posts after the Christian Democrats
lost an election on May 9,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported.  
 Juergen Ruettgers , 58, will give up his leadership of the
CDU in the region and also quit his post as a deputy chairman of
the party, which is also that of Federal Chancellor  Angela Merkel , at national level, DPA said.  
 Ruettgers said on June 19 that he won’t run against
 Hannelore Kraft , his Social Democrat challenger for the
premiership of North Rhine-Westphalia.
