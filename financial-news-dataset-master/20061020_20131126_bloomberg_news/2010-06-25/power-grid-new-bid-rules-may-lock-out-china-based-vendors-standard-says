             Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.
is making it mandatory for suppliers to have manufacturing
facilities in India within three years in a move that could
close the door on imported Chinese power equipment, the Business
Standard newspaper said, citing Power Grid Chairman S.K.
Chaturvedi. The company’s board will likely approve the proposal
at a July 2 meeting, it said.
