             NATO’s plans in Afghanistan risk 
becoming a strategic catastrophe unless the organization 
changes direction, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing 
Stanislaw Koziej, director of Poland’s National Security Bureau.  
 In a wrtten report he said North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization troops in Afghanistan were “passively waiting” 
for developments, and urged NATO to switch tactics from 
offensive to defensive, giving up on turning the country into 
an ally and instead focusing on protecting itself from future 
threats, the newspaper said.  
 Poland has about 2,500 troops in Afghanistan, and 18 have 
been killed, the WSJ said.
