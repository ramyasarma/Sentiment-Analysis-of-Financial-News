             New government oversight should
avert a return to the “good old days” of outsize bonuses and
lavish perks on Wall Street even if bankers still don’t “get
it,” Obama administration paymaster  Kenneth Feinberg  said.  
 Feinberg, who led the Treasury Department effort to slash
executive compensation at  American International Group Inc. ,
 Citigroup Inc.  and other bailed out firms, said he isn’t sure
bankers understand that the financial crisis and $700 billion
bailout changed the rules.  
 “I don’t think they get it, but I’m not sure they’ll go
back,” Feinberg said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend.  
 President  Barack Obama  appointed Feinberg in an effort to
quell a political furor over multimillion-dollar bonus payouts
at companies whose excessive risk-taking helped bring the U.S.
economy to the brink of collapse in 2008. During his year on the
job, Feinberg has pushed companies to pay executives with less
cash and vested stock.  
 The populist outrage over bankers’ pay has also spurred
efforts across the federal government, and overseas, to rein in
compensation.  
 In the regulatory overhaul legislation Congress reached
agreement on today, shareholders are given more power to voice
displeasure with corporate leaders’ compensation packages. The
Group of 20 nations has also pushed banks to tie pay more
closely to long-term performance.  
 With all that attention, Feinberg said, “It will be very
tough for Wall Street to go back to the good old days.”  
 Earlier this week, Feinberg said he will step down from his
Treasury Department pay post by the end of August to focus on
his new job as the government-appointed administrator of  BP
Plc ’s $20 billion fund to pay claims stemming from the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill.
