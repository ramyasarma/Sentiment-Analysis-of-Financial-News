             Senator  Blanche Lincoln  will accept
a House compromise on a derivatives measure that would force
banks to push swaps trading into subsidiaries, clearing the last
major hurdle in the financial overhaul bill.  
 Lincoln, the Arkansas Democrat who leads the Senate
Agriculture Committee, accepted Representative  Collin Peterson ’s
proposal to let banks such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and  Citigroup
Inc.  trade interest-rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps and
instruments deemed as “hedging for the bank’s own risk.”  
 The plan outlined by Peterson, the Minnesota Democrat who
leads the House Agriculture Committee, would still require banks
to use subsidiaries for trading of non-investment grade
entities, commodities and credit-default swaps not cleared
through an exchange.  
 “There are people who want more restrictive language than
I do, and there are those who want to open up the barn door,”
Lincoln said today. “We have reached a good compromise.”  
 Lincoln accepted Peterson’s modifications with slight
tweaks of her own, which will be proposed in a Senate counter-
offer. The tweaks are technical changes, said Senate aide who
declined to be identified because details aren’t public.  
 White House and Treasury Department officials worked with
House-Senate conferees to craft a compromise on the Lincoln
proposal for much of the past two days. The measure is part of a
broader financial bill aimed at overhauling Wall Street’s
regulations after the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression.  
 Representative  Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat
leading the congressional negotiations, said he thought the
language would go “a little further than I would go, but it’s
the best compromise we can get.”
