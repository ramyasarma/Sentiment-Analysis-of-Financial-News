             The euro and the pound will decline
against the dollar as fiscal retrenchment in Europe and the U.K.
slows growth relative to the U.S., according to Bank of Tokyo
Mitsubishi UFJ.  
 “We would agree with the U.S. stance and find it difficult
to fathom the idea of rushing through fiscal consolidation
measures to appease ratings agencies that played a key role in
orchestrating the onset of the entire financial crisis,”  Derek Halpenny , European head of global currency research, wrote in a
report today. “This policy divergence is likely to mean that
both the euro and the pound will resume their descent against
the U.S. dollar over the coming months.”  
 The pound was 0.2 percent lower at $1.4912 and 82.43 pence
per euro as of 12:26 p.m. in London. The euro dropped 0.3
percent to $1.2294.
