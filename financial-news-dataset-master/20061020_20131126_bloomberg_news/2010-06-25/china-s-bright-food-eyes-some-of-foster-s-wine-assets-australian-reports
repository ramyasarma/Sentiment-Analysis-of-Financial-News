             China’s Bright Food Group Co. wants
Foster’s Group Ltd. to break up its wine assets rather than
demerge the business into a separate company, the Australian
newspaper reported without saying where it got the information.
Bright is interested in the Australian company’s Hunter Valley
operations in New South Wales state rather than the whole wine
division which may be worth as much as A$4 billion ($3.5
billion), the newspaper said.
