             Prime Minister  David Cameron  said he
would like all British troops to return from Afghanistan before
the next general election, scheduled for 2015.  
 “I want that to happen, make no mistake about it,” Cameron
told Sky News television in an interview at the Group of Eight
summit in Muskoka, Canada, today. “We can’t be there for another
five years, having been there for nine years already.”  
 More than 300 British soldiers have now died in
Afghanistan, and Cameron said yesterday the U.K. is paying a
“very high price” for its military operation in the country.  
 “I prefer not to see it in strict timetables,” the prime
minister told Sky today. “I want us to roll up our sleeves and
get on with delivering what will bring the success we want,
which is not a perfect Afghanistan, but some stability in
Afghanistan and the ability for the Afghans themselves to run
their country, so they can come home.”
