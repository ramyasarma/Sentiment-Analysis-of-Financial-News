             Ukraine’s central bank adviser
 Valeriy Lytvytskyi  said he will recommend a cut in the key
discount and refinancing rates if inflation stays below 1
percent this month.  
 “An interest-rate cut will spur consumption,” Lytvytskyi
told reporters today in Kiev. “We will be driven out of the
recession by consumption.”  
 The central bank cut the discount rate on June 8 to 9.5
percent from 10.25 percent after consumer prices declined 0.6
percent in May while annual  inflation  slowed to 8.5 percent, the
lowest level in almost four years.  
 The  economy , which slumped 15 percent in 2009, expanded 4.8
percent in the first quarter. The government is trying to
negotiate a new loan program from the International Monetary
Fund to spur the expansion.  
 Consumer-price growth will not exceed 0.5 percent in June,
Deputy Finance Minister Tetyana Yefymenko said on June 21.
