             Russia may carry out an “organic
diversification” of its economy as record-low interest rates
and slowing inflation spur credit growth, said  Chris Osborne ,
head of the U.S. unit of Russia’s oldest investment bank.  
 “Diversification can happen from the ground up,” Osborne,
chief executive officer of Troika Dialog USA, said yesterday in
an interview with Bloomberg Television in New York. “Russian
banks will start lending now in rubles at longer maturities, at
reasonable rates to companies that have never had access to that
kind of credit before.”  
 President  Dmitry Medvedev  met U.S. counterpart  Barack Obama 
yesterday in Washington as he sought to modernize Russia’s
economy and lessen dependence on oil and gas exports. Energy
accounts for about a quarter of gross domestic product, a
reliance the Russian leader called “primitive” and
“humiliating” last year.  
 Russia’s  central bank  cut its main interest rates 14 times
since April 2009 as  consumer-price growth  decelerated to 6
percent in May, the slowest pace in 12 years. Inflation this
year may slow to between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent, the
government estimates.  
 “You have much lower rates than you had in the past,”
Osborne said. “So there can be an organic diversification of
the Russian economy.”
