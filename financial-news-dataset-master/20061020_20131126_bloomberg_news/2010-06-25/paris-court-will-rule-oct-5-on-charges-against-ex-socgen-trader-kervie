             A Paris criminal court will rule on
charges against former Societe General trader Jerome Kerviel on
Oct. 5 Judge Dominique Pauthe said today, ending three weeks of
hearings into his responsibility for the bank’s 4.9 billion-euro
trading loss in 2008.  
 Prosecutors said yesterday the court should sentence
Kerviel to four years in prison for abuse of trust, faking
documents and hacking into the bank’s computer systems.
Kerviel’s lawyer, Olivier Metzner, asked the court to clear his
client today.
