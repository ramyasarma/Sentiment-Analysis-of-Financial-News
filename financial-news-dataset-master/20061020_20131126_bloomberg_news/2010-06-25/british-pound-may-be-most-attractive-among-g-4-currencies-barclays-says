             The British pound will rise relative
to the other group of four currencies, the dollar, euro and yen,
as the U.K. government takes a tough stance in improving the
nation’s finances, Barclays Plc said.  
 “Prospects appear brightest for the pound,” from a fiscal
perspective,  Paul Robinson , a currency strategist at Barclays
Capital in London, wrote in an e-mailed report titled Global
Outlook: Rebound, But No Raging Bull Market. “The U.K. appears
to be tackling the problem fairly aggressively and does not have
the political complications that exist in the euro area.”  
 Sterling reached $1.5012 against the dollar yesterday, the
highest level since May 12, on optimism that measures announced
by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne  in an emergency
budget on June 22 would cut the nation’s deficit and enable
Britain to keep its top credit rating.  
 The U.K. currency traded at $1.4983 as of 5:06 p.m. in
London, from $1.4935 in New York yesterday. Barclays forecast
sterling to rise to $1.60 in six months, according to today’s
report.
