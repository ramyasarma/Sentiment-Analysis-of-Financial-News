             The world’s largest gold  coin , a
Maple Leaf, sold for 3.27 million euros ($4.02 million) at an
auction in Vienna.  
 Spain’s Oro Direct bought the coin, which has a
face value of C$1 million ($960,000), Dorotheum spokeswoman
Doris Krumpl said. The coin, made of pure gold, weighs 100
kilograms (3,215 ounces) and is 53 centimeters (21 inches) in
diameter, according to the Dorotheum’s  website . The coin is
worth $4 million, based on the metal’s price yesterday.  
 Gold climbed to a record $1,265.30 an ounce on June 21 in
London and has gained 14 percent this year as investors seek to
protect their wealth from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and
concern the global economic recovery will falter. Purchases
of coins are tightening supplies and boosting the premiums added
to the price of bullion.  
 Oro Direct Sale S.L.U. sells gold products produced by the
Austrian Mint and Argor Heraeus, according to its website.
The hammer price doesn’t include a fee to be paid to the
Dorotheum, which drew eight bidders to the auction, Krumpl said.
Dorotheum declined to say the amount of the fee.  
 The Maple Leaf, listed in the current edition of Guinness
World Records, was previously on loan to the collection of
Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum, according to the Dorotheum.
One side shows three maple leaves, Canada’s national symbol, and
the other bears the image of  Queen Elizabeth II .  
 Liquidators  
 The coin was sold on behalf of the liquidators of Austrian
investment and venture-capital firm  AvW Invest AG , Dorotheum
spokeswoman Ingeborg Fiegl said on June 11. She was unable to
identify the liquidators.  
 Gold for immediate delivery was at $1,243.45 an ounce
yesterday and traded at $1,251.70 at 1:13 p.m. in London today.
The metal is headed for a 10th consecutive annual gain, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920.  
 Investors have increased physical bullion holdings this
year, buying more coins and pushing holdings in gold-backed
exchange-traded funds to a record. The  MSCI World Index  of
equities fell 7.6 percent this year, while the euro slipped 14
percent against the dollar.  
 Coin sales to European customers from the Perth Mint in
Australia surged in May, and South Africa’s Rand Refinery Ltd.
boosted production, while demand was strong enough to constitute
“panic buying,” Muenze Oesterreich AG, the Austrian mint said
last month. Premiums for coins such as Krugerrands and British
sovereigns jumped compared with May, Dublin-based GoldCore Ltd.
said this month.
