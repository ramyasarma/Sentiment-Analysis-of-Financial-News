             ICAP Plc , the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks, plans to buy brokerages in Brazil
this year, said  Paulo Levy , director of  ICAP do Brasil CTVM , the
company’s unit in the South American country.  
 “We will start looking at opportunities, as buyers,” Levy
said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro on June 22.
“We’re now focused in introducing new products, but in six
months, closer to the end of the year, we’ll start searching.”  
 Brazil’s fastest expansion in two decades is attracting
foreign investment to the financial services industry.  Caixa
Geral de Depósitos SA  of Portugal agreed to buy a 70 percent
stake in  Banif SGPS  SA’s Brazilian brokerage unit Banif
Corretora de Valores e Cambio SA for about 57.8 million euros
($71.3 million) on June 2.  UBS AG  agreed to buy Link
Investimentos for about $112 million on April 29.
