             Angola reduced the amount of assets
commercial banks must keep at the central bank to boost
liquidity and lending, Economy Minister  Manuel Nunes Junior 
said.  
 The amount of funds that must be kept at the central bank
was lowered to 25 percent from 30 percent, Junior said late
yesterday. The reserves can be kept in kwanza or foreign
currencies.  
 Banks had complained of a liquidity shortage after the
government raised the ratio to 30 percent from 20 percent since
March. In May, Angola allowed banks to use bonds as collateral
in an effort to solve the liquidity problems.  
 “This will enable banks to have more resources to finance
the economy and naturally, to reduce interest rates,” Jorge
Coje, director of payments and operations at Banco Nacional de
Angola, told RNA radio today.  
 The Banco Nacional de Angola has also lowered interest rates
on central bank bills as part of an effort to bring conditions
“back to normalcy.”  
 “We’ll take further adequate policies beginning with
relaxing restrictive monetary policies,” Junior told reporters
in the capital, Luanda.
