Minister Barbara Hogan said there is a “good opportunity” for
a wage dispute with workers at Eskom Holdings Ltd., the
country’s power utility, to be “settled soon.”  
 “I call on all the parties to abide by the law and follow
the next step prescribed in the law,” Hogan said in an e-mailed
statement. Hogan asked the Council for Conciliation, Mediation
and Arbitration “to appoint an arbitrator urgently and for the
arbitration to be held as soon as is possible.”
