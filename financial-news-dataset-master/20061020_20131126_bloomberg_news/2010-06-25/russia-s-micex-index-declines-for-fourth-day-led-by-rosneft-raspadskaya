             Russian  stocks fell  for a fourth
day, posting their first weekly decline in five weeks after the
Commerce Department said the U.S. economy expanded more slowly
than forecast.  
 Steelmakers  OAO Severstal  and  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel 
slid more than 2 percent and  OAO Rosneft , the country’s biggest
oil company, dropped 1.1 percent to 196.48 rubles at the close
in Moscow, its lowest in a month.  
 The U.S. economy grew at an annual 2.7 percent rate in the
first quarter, less than previously calculated and smaller than
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The 30-stock gauge retreated 1.1 percent to 1,347.58 in Moscow,
bringing its weekly decline to 1.5 percent. The Micex has fallen
12 percent from its April 15 peak on concern economic growth may
slow.  
 OAO Mobile TeleSystems , Russia’s largest mobile phone
company, climbed 2.8 percent higher to 243.41 rubles after the
company offered to buy out the remaining stake in OAO Comstar
United TeleSystems, according to a statement from the company.  
 MTS Chief Executive Officer  Mikhail Shamolin  said in a
conference call the company expects the merger to generate “at
least” $400 million of synergies over one to three years.  
 Comstar shares jumped as much as 6.2 percent in Moscow
trading, their biggest intraday increase since June 9, and
closed 0.4 percent higher at 206.74 rubles.  
 Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 1.4
percent, to $6,600 a metric ton in London. OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel, Russia’s biggest mining company, dropped to its lowest
in a month, losing 1.7 percent to 4,804.48 rubles.
