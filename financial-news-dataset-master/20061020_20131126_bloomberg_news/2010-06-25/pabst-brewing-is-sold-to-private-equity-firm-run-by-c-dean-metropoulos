             Pabst Brewing Co.’s purchase by C.
Dean Metropoulos & Co. closed, giving the private-equity firm
the owner of Pabst Blue Ribbon and Old Milwaukee beer.  
 C. Dean Metropoulos, who previously managed brands such as
Chef Boyardee and Hungry-Man, bought the company with his two
sons, he said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Pabst had
sought a $90 million term loan to back a buyout after last year
hiring Bank of America Merrill Lynch to find bidders.  
 The company’s  namesake beer , also known as PBR, has built a
cult following and was a personal favorite of  Dennis Hopper ’s
character in the 1986 film “Blue Velvet.” U.S. sales of Pabst
Blue Ribbon jumped 33 percent to $173 million in the 52 weeks
ended April 18, making it the 20th-largest beer brand, according
to SymphonyIRI Group, a Chicago-based market research firm.  
 “For the past four years, it’s been one of the fastest
growing brands in the country,” Metropoulos said.  
 The deal was contingent on renegotiating a “long-term”
agreement with MillerCoors LLC, the U.S. joint venture between
Molson Coors Brewing Co. and SABMiller Plc, Metropoulos said.
Pabst contracts production of its beer to MillerCoors, and the
existing accord was set to expire in 2014, according to
regulatory filings.  
 Other Pabst brands include Schlitz and Colt 45 Malt Liquor.
Pabst Brewing traces its roots to a 19th-century brewer founded
by Jacob Best, according to the company’s website.
