             Corporations from the U.S., Japan
and Europe expect the euro to remain under pressure against the
dollar for the rest of this year, a quarterly survey of clients
by JPMorgan Chase & Co. showed.  
 More than 90 percent of respondents expect the common
currency to remain below $1.30 at the end of the year, JPMorgan
said. The bank between June 14 and June 21 surveyed 141 clients
with a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion. The
euro traded between $1.2103 and $1.2487 during that period.  
 The average forecast for euro’s year-end level, weighted by
firm size, fell to $1.22 from $1.34 in March, according to the
survey. The average forecast for December 2011 fell to $1.25 in
this quarter’s survey from $1.34 in March.  
 “Only European companies envisioned a modest recovery in
the euro toward end-2011 to above 1.3, while companies in both
the U.S. and Japan expected the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate
to remain under pressure throughout 2010 and 2011,” a team of
JPMorgan strategists led by  Gabriel de Kock  wrote in a note
published today.  
 The euro, at $1.2294 today, has weakened 0.4 percent this
week. Last week it gained the most in most than a year as an
easing in concern over Europe’s debt crisis spurred traders to
end bets the shared currency would decline. The common currency
touched a four-year low of $1.1877 on June 7.  
 The U.S. dollar lost ground for a third consecutive week
versus the Japanese yen, falling 1.5 percent to 89.35 yen from
90.71 yen.  
 Foreign-Exchange Hedging  
 European Union policy makers last month announced a loan
plan of almost $1 trillion to aid debt-laden governments and
shore up the 16-nation currency. EU leaders agreed last week to
disclose how banks perform in stress tests, seeking to show
investors that the financial system can withstand shocks.  
 U.S., European and Japanese corporations boosted foreign-
exchange hedging as of the end of the second quarter relative to
March, the JPMorgan survey showed. The percentage of 2010
foreign-exchange exposure hedged by these corporations rose to
64.6 percent in June, up from 58.2 percent in March. The hedging
ratio was close to the average June level in the client surveys
over the past five years.  
 G-20 leaders meet in Toronto June 26-27 to discuss policies
aimed at addressing Europe’s crisis, spurring global growth and
overhauling financial regulation.
