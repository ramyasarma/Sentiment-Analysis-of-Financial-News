             Hong Kong stocks  fell, paring the
benchmark index’s longest weekly winning streak in more than a
year, as U.S. companies’ worse-than-estimated profit forecasts
heightened concerns about growth in the world’s largest economy.  
 Cosco Pacific Ltd. , Asia’s third-biggest container-terminal
operator, slid 3.6 percent. China Minsheng Banking Corp., the
nation’s first privately owned lender, declined 2.2 percent
after the China Daily said Chinese local government debt may
depress banking industry profitability.  Zhongyu Gas Holdings Ltd. 
sank 16 percent after the piped-gas distributor posted a first-
quarter loss.  
 “The U.S. economy is not doing very good,” said  Francis Lun , general manager at Fulbright Securities Co. “Export-
related and shipping stocks are influenced by decreased exports
as external demand dropped.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  retreated 0.2 percent to close at
20,690.79, paring its gains this week to 2 percent. That’s the
measure’s fifth straight weekly advance, its longest winning
streak since the six weeks ended April 17, 2009.  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of the so-called H-
shares of Chinese companies slipped 0.6 percent to 11,865.17.  
 The Hang Seng Index has dropped 5.4 percent this year as
worries about budget deficits in Europe and credit tightening by
China dented confidence in the strength of the global economy.  
 Shares on the benchmark index are priced at an average  13.6
times  estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16, the
highest level in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Cosco, Foxconn Decline  
 Cosco Pacific dropped 3.6 percent to HK$9.52. Foxconn
International Holdings Ltd., the world’s biggest contract maker
of mobile phones, declined 3.1 percent to HK$5.63. The two
stocks posted the sharpest declines on the Hang Seng Index.  
 Dell Inc., the world’s third-largest maker of personal
computers, said it expects fiscal 2011 revenue may be as little
as $60.31 billion, lower than analysts’ estimates of $61.79
billion. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., a retailer of home-furnishings,
also forecast second-quarter earnings that missed estimates.  
 Esprit Holdings Ltd. , a Hong Kong-based global clothing
retailer, slid 2.6 percent to HK$44.45. A single trade of 17
million shares, equivalent to 1.3 percent of outstanding shares,
was executed 5 seconds after the market’s open at a price of
HK$45.55.  
 Minsheng Bank declined 2.2 percent to HK$6.74. Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s largest bank, lost
0.5 percent to HK$5.87.  
 Local Government Debts  
 Chinese local government debt may depress banking industry
profitability by 7.9 percent between this year and 2012, the
China Daily reported, citing a report from the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences. Banks may have to set aside 283.1 billion
yuan ($42 billion) in provisions for bad loans over the next two
years as the ratio of doubtful debt to local financing arms
rises, according to CASS’s 2010 Blue Book for China Finance.  
 Zhongyu Gas sank 16 percent to 66 Hong Kong cents after
posting a first-quarter loss of HK$4.9 million ($630,000).
Trading resumed today after being suspended since March 22
because the company couldn’t release its 2009 annual results as
required by the stock exchange.  
 Zijin Mining Group Co. , China’s largest gold producer,
dropped 1.3 percent to HK$5.88. The company canceled its A$545
million ($470 million) purchase of Indophil Resources after a
Philippine province where the Australian company operates banned
open-pit mining. Zijin said it abandoned the agreement due to
“uncertainties” over the deal, without elaborating.  
 Neo-China Land Group (Holdings) Ltd. slumped 43 percent to
HK$2.84 after the developer said it had disposed of a 45 percent
stake in itself. The stock resumed trading after being suspended
from Jan. 22, 2008.  
 Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.1 percent to 20,716.
More than two stocks declined for each that gained among the
gauge’s 43 constituents.
