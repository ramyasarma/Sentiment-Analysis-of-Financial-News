             The on-going nature of the oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico makes it difficult to quantify losses for
people in the region, said  Kenneth R. Feinberg , the government-
appointed administrator of a $20 billion fund to compensate
victims of the spill.  
 “It’s very hard to calculate long-term business
interruption losses as long as the leak continues,” Feinberg
said in a radio interview today with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg
Surveillance. “It would nice if the leak stopped first.”  
 Feinberg said he’ll be poring over profit and loss
statements and tax returns from people who claim their
businesses have been affected by the spill in an effort to begin
distributing payments from the $20 billion escrow account set up
by BP Plc.  
 “I’ll sit with that shrimper, we’ll try to agree on a
calculated long-term loss,” Feinberg said. “I’ll offer a check
to that shrimper. He can either take it or say, no thank you and
litigate.”  
 Feinberg, who administered a similar fund for families of
victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, was tapped last
week by President  Barack Obama  to run the escrow account. Rig
workers who lost jobs after Obama imposed a six-month moratorium
on drilling will draw from a fund limited to $100 million,
Feinberg said.  
 “Do not underestimate the emotion here with people’s
livelihoods at stake,” Feinberg said.  
 The account will provide emergency payments “immediately
with very little corroboration” so that homeowners, business
owners or other people with pressing needs can make payments
through their transition period, Feinberg said  
 People are not obligated to take payments offered by the
fund, though the alternative, suing BP, could take five years
and produce the same result, Feinberg said.
