             Kenneth R. Feinberg , administrator
of the $20 billion fund for victims of BP Plc’s oil spill, said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital
with  Al Hunt ” airing this weekend that he will use federal
fraud investigators to deter bogus claims while guarding
personal information provided by businesses and individuals.  
 (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

 AL HUNT: And joining us now from New Orleans is the
administrator of the BP oil spill claims, Ken Feinberg. Mr.
Feinberg, thank you for joining us.  
 Let me start off. You’re processing emergency loans
immediately, but you want to move to a comprehensive protocol
where people get claims in exchange for not litigating. When can
you reach that stage, and how many people are you going to have
to hire?  
 KEN FEINBERG: Well, it will be about 30 days. We hope to
have a protocol up and running to provide lump sum checks to
eligible claimants. Thanks to BP, they deserve some credit for
setting up the program. Already there’s about 750 adjusters now
working in the Gulf; 25, 26 offices have already been
established. And I’m hoping with additional support - I don’t
know how many yet - we’ll be able to process all of the claims
very quickly.  
 HUNT: BP has already paid out $126 million in claims, as
you’ve just noted; none have been denied. Can you keep up that
kind of record?  
 FEINBERG: Well, I don’t think that record will stay. None
have been denied. Now, we don’t know how many are in limbo.  
 HUNT: Right.  
 FEINBERG: BP, to its credit, is paying claims that are
eligible. I’ll have to decide whether a claim is eligible or
ineligible and how much should be paid.  
 HUNT: $100 million separate for - that’s set aside to cover
direct and indirect losses from the six-month moratorium. Almost
everyone down there says that’s not enough. The industry says
$165 million just in salaries alone. How are going to get the
extra money for that? Because you now administer that fund. Is
BP going to kick in more, should other kick into that, or should
people just say sorry, you’re going to have to eat some of those
losses?  
 FEINBERG: Well, that moratorium issue is an interesting
question you raise. I read the newspapers; the moratorium has
been lifted by a federal judge.  
 HUNT: But it’s being appealed.  
 FEINBERG: It remains to be seen --. That’s right, but it
remains to be seen whether the moratorium will stick. It remains
to be seen how much will be needed if the moratorium is
reinserted, or reestablished. I do believe that that $100
million fund will be part of my jurisdiction, and I’ll have to
deal with that moratorium if and when we begin processing those
claims after the litigation ends.  
 HUNT: But if the moratorium does stick for a while and you
need extra money for that fund, where do you get it?  
 FEINBERG: I’ll have to go back to the Administration and to
BP and request that the $100 million is insufficient and
additional funds should be provided.  
 HUNT: Okay. There is going to be billions of dollars of job
and business losses, which you have talked about already. Do you
have any sense of what the healthcare-related costs may be?  
 FEINBERG: No, that remains to be seen. Fortunately, Al,
unlike the 9/11 Fund, of course, there are relatively modest
number of physical injury claims so far. I would hope that the
total number of physical injury claims, death claims would be de
minimis so that health costs and health expense wouldn’t be a
tough issue for me. But that will remain to be seen.  
 HUNT: There is a cry for total transparency here. Some
politicians, including Governor Jindal of Louisiana, have said
in so many words, “We need access to this information so we can
provide independent oversight.”  Are you going to let the state
and federal officials have access to the names of all of your
claimants?  
 FEINBERG: Absolutely not. Just as with the 9/11 Fund, which
was taxpayer money, you’ll recall, I’ll have to work with the
various states and the federal government in coming up with a
transparency program that will provide Louisiana and other
states and the federal government with sufficient information to
monitor this program without violating the privacy rights of
individual claimants.  
 The last thing that anybody should want is individualized
data provided government that would result in individuals being
very reluctant to file a claim if they think that their private
information, individualized, is going to go to a governmental
agency.  
 So I think Governor Jindal and others - I’ve met with the
Governor. He’s absolutely accurate and correct that there should
be greater transparency of data. He has made it very clear to me
personally he does not want to violate the individual rights,
privacy rights, of any individual.  
 How we strike that balance, I’m working now with various
states and the federal government - Chairman Conyers of the
House Judiciary Committee - in an effort to strike the right
balance as we did with the 9/11 Fund.  
 HUNT: Your 9/11 settlements involved remarkably little
fraud. A lot of experts say this is more complicated; it’s BP’s
money and the danger of fraud is far greater. Are there one or
two steps that you’d like to take to minimize the danger of
fraud?  
 FEINBERG: Yes. As with the 9/11 Fund, I can think of two
immediately. One, a recognition that the Department of Justice
Fraud Division, the best there is, will be overseeing this
independent program to help me in checking for and deterring
fraudulent activity. Nothing can destroy the credibility of a
program quicker than allegations of fraud.  
 And the second thing, when we process these claims, we need
at least sufficient corroboration of the claim so that it’s
justifiable that it receive payment.  
 HUNT: Have you gotten a commitment from the Justice
Department Fraud Division that they will cooperate with you on
that?  
 FEINBERG: I’m sure they will. I met with the Justice
Department the other day with the members of the Fraud Division.
They’re going to get back to me with a proposed plan. I’m
confident that the Division will help me, and there’s no better
help than the Justice Department in that regard.  
 HUNT: Mr. Feinberg, one question about the job you are just
leaving as Compensation Czar. After all the financial system has
been through, and Congress is on the verge of passing an
overhaul, do you think the Wall Street barons get it when it
comes to outside compensation? Or are we more likely to go back
to the old let-the-good-times-roll days?  
 FEINBERG: Well, I don’t think they get it, but I’m not sure
they’ll go back to the old time rolls (ph) days. Between the
work I’ve done as the Special Master for Executive Compensation,
the work of the Congress and this new regulatory reform bill,
the work of Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and
the SEC and Secretary Geithner with the G20 executive comp
principles, I think that it will be very difficult for Wall
Street to go back to the good old days.  
 HUNT: Okay. Ken Feinberg, thank you very much for joining
us from New Orleans. And when we come back, why General
McChrystal had to go. We’ll talk with our reporters right after
the break.
