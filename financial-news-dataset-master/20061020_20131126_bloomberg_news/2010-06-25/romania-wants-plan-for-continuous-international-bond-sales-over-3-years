             Romania’s government is working on a
strategy to continually sell bonds on international markets for
the next three years, Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu said.  
 Any bond sales would depend on market conditions, he told
reporters in Bucharest today. He gave no further details. Bids
in recent domestic bonds sales were rejected because yields
demanded in the auctions were too high, Vladescu said.
