             When it opened off-Broadway 25 years
ago, “Nunsense” struck enough people as whimsical and charming
to sustain a run of 3,672 performances and spawn a global
franchise that made a multimillionaire of its creator, Dan
Goggin.  
 Revived now, Goggin’s musical revue about the Little
Sisters of Hoboken is as tired and slight as a flower pressed in
a book with no meaningful memory attached.  
 It concerns the five surviving sisters after inadvertent
food poisoning by the cook (Sister Julia, Child of God), has
left 52 dead. So far, 48 have been buried, but money ran out,
leaving the remaining quartet ignominiously stuffed in the
freezer.  
 The fundraising musical they improvise in the auditorium of
the Mount Saint Helen’s School must compete with the set of
“Grease,” which the kids are putting on. Reverend Mother Mary
Regina orders Sister Mary Leo to cover the bare legs on the
Marilyn Monroe poster, and most of the humor is on that order.
Take one of the nuns, Sister Mary Amnesia, so-named when a
crucifix clocked her on the head, erasing her memory.  
 The show consists mostly of the songs the nuns deliver,
having not much more plot to hang them on than tiny rivalries,
minor mishaps and wimples being turned into comedy costuming.
Adding to the sense of desuetude, audience participation is
encouraged.  
 Tap-Dancing Sisters  
 Teri Osborn is credited with the elementary choreography --
largely tap dancing in variously colored shoes. Two musicians
accompany on keyboard and synthesizers.  
 Goggin wrote even the anodyne music and often overreaching
lyrics (“there were Hottentots with rotten tots”). He also
directed the cast -- Bambi Jones, Bonnie Lee, Maria Montana,
Jeanne Tinker and Stephanie Wahl -- all oozing, to quote the
text, “funsense.”  
 The show plays at the very same theater where it began,
which may smack slightly of a criminal’s returning to the scene
of his crime.  
 Through July 18 at the  Cherry Lane Theatre , 38 Commerce St.

 ‘When We Go’  
 Lee Blessing’s “When We Go Upon the Sea” fantasizes that
 George W. Bush  is in a fancy hotel room at The Hague on the
night before his trial as war criminal is to begin.  
 W. is alone except for a hotel staffer, Piet, there to keep
him company, allow him to vent (uninterestingly) and ply him
with alcohol. Compassionately, Blessing also provides him with a
bed companion, Ana Lisa, who, though not a prostitute, has
raucous offstage sex with him.  
 It emerges that she is Piet’s wife, and this sort of thing
serves the couple as an aphrodisiac as they retire for equally
noisy unseen sex. Apparently they do this charitably for all
visiting war criminals, which makes me wonder whether the supply
is big enough for them to earn their keep.  
 Conan McCarty (Bush), Peter Schmitz and Kim Carson do their
best to speak the unlikely dialogue with conviction. Directed by
Paul Meshejian, this  InterAct Theatre  of Philadelphia production
takes its title from the characters looking longingly out at the
sea.  
 Who can blame their yearning to be as far away as possible
from this play?  
 Through July 3 at 59E59 Theaters, 59 E. 59th St.
