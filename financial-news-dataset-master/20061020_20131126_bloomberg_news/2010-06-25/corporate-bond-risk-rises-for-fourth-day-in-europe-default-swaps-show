             The cost of insuring against losses
on European corporate bonds rose, reversing an earlier decline,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 6 basis
points to 562.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at
7:30 a.m. in London.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings increased 1.75 basis points to 130.4,
JPMorgan prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from
default was unchanged.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($12.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality
