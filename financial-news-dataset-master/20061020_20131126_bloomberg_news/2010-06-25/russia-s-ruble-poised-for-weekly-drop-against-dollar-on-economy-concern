             The ruble had its third weekly
decline this month versus the dollar as concern that global
economic growth will slow curbed investor appetite for riskier
assets.  
 The ruble closed little changed against the greenback at
31.0950 in Moscow, sliding 0.3 percent in the week. The Russian
currency depreciated less than 0.1 percent against the euro to
38.2450. The government’s benchmark sovereign dollar bonds due
April 2020 climbed, with the yield narrowing 3 basis points to
5.45 percent.  
 Emerging-market stocks fell, dragging the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index lower for a fourth day, after Commerce Department
in Washington said the U.S. economy grew an annual 2.7 percent
in the first quarter, less than previously calculated. Crude,
Russia’s main export earner, slid as much as 0.8 percent to
$75.90 a barrel before adding 0.5 percent to $76.86 at the close
of ruble trading in Moscow.  
 “The external environment is negative for Russia,”
 Vladimir Osakovsky , economist at UniCredit SpA in Moscow said in
a phone interview today.  
 Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
31.3019 per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of
31.2410 on June 24. The contracts are a guide to expectations of
currency movements as they allow foreign investors and companies
to fix the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The movements against the dollar and the euro left the
ruble little changed at 34.3161 against the central bank’s
 target  currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
