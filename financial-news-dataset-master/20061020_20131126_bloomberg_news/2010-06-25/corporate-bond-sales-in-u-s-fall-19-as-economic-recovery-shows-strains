             Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. , the chewing-gum
maker acquired by Mars Inc. in 2008, and Amsterdam-based  CNH
Global NV  issued debt this week as sales of corporate bonds in
the U.S. fell 19 percent.  
 Wrigley issued $1.8 billion of debt in a four-part offering
as it tapped the corporate bond market for the first time since
its sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CNH Global,
maker of Case and New Holland farm equipment, issued $1.5
billion of notes in the biggest offering of high-yield, high-
risk debt in two months, Bloomberg data show.  
 Companies sold $16.5 billion of debt, compared with $20.3
billion last week, as sales of new homes fell to a record low
rate and the Federal Reserve said Europe’s sovereign debt crisis
is rendering U.S. financial conditions “less supportive” of an
economic recovery. Corporate bond yields fell to the lowest in a
month, following Treasuries.  
 “There’s definitely fear and paranoia,” said  Scott MacDonald , head of credit and economics research at Aladdin
Capital Holdings LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. “The economy’s
going to slow in the second quarter and there’s going to be more
a lot more talk about a double dip, there’s no question about
it.”  
 The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
corporate bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 1 basis point to
207 basis points, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
U.S. Corporate Master Index. Average yields fell to 4.43 percent
from 4.53 percent, the lowest since May 21, the index data show.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 High-Yield Spreads  
 Spreads on high-yield, high-risk debt expanded 7 basis
points to 689 basis points, the widest since June 17, after
touching 668 basis points on June 21, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. Yields fell to 9.03 percent, the lowest
since May 19, from 9.06 percent. High-yield debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  
 This week’s corporate bond sales compare with a 2010
average of $19.8 billion, Bloomberg data show. Issuance has
surpassed that level only once in the last nine weeks.  
 The yield on 10-year  Treasury bonds , the market bellwether,
fell to 3.12 percent on June 23, the least in 13 months, after
U.S. government statistics showed home sales plunged in May and
Federal Reserve policymakers renewed their pledge to keep
overnight lending rates near zero for an “extended period.”
The 10-year yield rose to 3.14 percent yesterday.  
 Purchases of new homes fell 33 percent last month to an
annual pace of 300,000, the lowest level since at least 1963,
according to Commerce Department data released June 23. Sales of
previously owned homes fell 2.2 percent in May, the National
Association of Realtors said a day earlier.  
 ‘Developments Abroad’  
 The U.S. economy is continuing its recovery even as
“financial conditions have become less supportive of economic
growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad,” Fed
officials wrote in a June 23 statement after two days of
meetings.  
 U.S. corporate bond sales tumbled from $140.1 billion in
March, the most since January 2009, to $32.9 billion last month
amid concern among investors that the sovereign debt crisis in
Europe would stifle global economic growth.  
 “The corporate bond market has a certain degree of
economic uncertainty priced in already,” said  Guy LeBas , chief
fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia. “It’s too early to really feel any of the
effects of the European crisis directly in the U.S.”  
 CNH Global’s transaction was the largest high-yield bond
sale since April 20, when CF Industries Holdings Group Inc.
issued $1.6 billion of eight- and 10-year notes, Bloomberg data
show. It led $2.43 billion of junk bond sales, an 87 percent
increase over the previous week.  
 Junk Sales  
 Weekly sales of speculative-grade company debt averaged
$4.7 billion through the week of June 18, Bloomberg data show.  
 Capella Healthcare Inc., the Franklin, Tennessee-based
operator of hospitals, sold $500 million of seven-year notes and
Michael Foods Inc., the biggest North American producer of egg
products, issued $430 million of debt due in 2018 in the week’s
other high-yield offerings, Bloomberg data show.  
 Wrigley’s offering and Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s $2.75
billion sale of notes due in 2012 and 2015 led $14.3 billion of
investment-grade issuance this week, Bloomberg data show.  
 Jefferies Group Inc., the New York-based securities firm
that’s helped manage 22 high-yield bond sales for $4.76 billion,
issued $400 million of notes, Bloomberg data show.  
 “There’s still demand for high-yield securities,” said
 Richard B. Handler , Jefferies chief executive officer, in a June
22 conference call with investors. “There’s still demand for
well-structured transactions that are priced appropriately, and
I think the market is relatively healthy.”
