             U.S. stock-index futures turned
negative after a report showed the nation’s first-quarter gross
domestic product growth was lower than expected.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September fell 0.1 percent to 1,069.20 as of 8:35 a.m. in New
York. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average expiring in
September declined 0.1 percent to 10,092.  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than previously calculated, reflecting a
smaller gain in consumer spending and a bigger trade gap.  
 The revised increase in gross domestic product was smaller
than the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News and compares with a 3 percent estimate issued last month,
figures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington.
Corporate profits climbed more than previously projected.  
 Stocks fell this week as the Federal Reserve signaled that
European indebtedness may harm American growth and sales of new
U.S. homes fell to the lowest level on record. Concern about
risks to the recovery has dragged the S&P 500 down 12 percent
from this year’s high April 23, to within 2.2 percent of this
year’s low at 1,050.47 reached on June 7.  
 Group of Eight leaders meet today in Canada to debate how
far governments can slash budgets without stifling growth,
before the start of the Group of 20 summit tomorrow. U.S.
President Barack Obama is urging G-20 nations to support the
global economic recovery by focusing on growth, while Germany
and the U.K., are focusing on reducing budget deficits.
