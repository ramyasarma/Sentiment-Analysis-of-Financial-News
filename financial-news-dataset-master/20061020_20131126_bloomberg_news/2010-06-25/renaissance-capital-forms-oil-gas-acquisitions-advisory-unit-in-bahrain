             Renaissance Capital, the Russian
investment firm that has arranged the most stock offerings in
that country this year, set up an oil and natural gas merger and
acquisition company to advise clients from Hong Kong to Morocco.  
 The company, called Renaissance JMW Energy, will work with
 Jeffrey Waterous , the former chairman of Waterous & Co. before
it was sold to Bank of Nova Scotia in 2005, Renaissance said
today. Waterous completed about $15 billion in transactions in
four years through 2005.  
 “The business will focus on emerging and frontier
markets” in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and parts of
Asia, Waterous said by phone from London. The firm will advise
energy companies and assist sovereign wealth funds, some of
which “have begun to invest directly in the industry and it’s a
growing trend,” he said.  
 The firm will be based in Bahrain and plans to open an
office in Argentina in 2011. The Moscow-based investment firm
survived the 2008 credit crisis after Chief Executive Officer
 Stephen Jennings  sold a 50 percent stake to  Mikhail Prokhorov , a
Russian billionaire, the majority owner of the New Jersey Nets
basketball team.
