             Bill Gross  said investors should buy
 American International Group Inc.  bonds, the Motley Fool
 reported , citing an interview with the manager of the world’s
biggest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co.  
 Pimco has been buying the securities for 12 to 18 months,
and also likes the bonds of Ally Bank, the GMAC financing
operation now owned by the U.S. government, the website cited
Gross as saying.  
 Investors should avoid buying assets in Europe as there is
too much uncertainty, Gross said in the report. Pimco doesn’t
own debt of Greece, Spain and Portugal, he said.  
 While there is a risk of a crisis in U.S. municipal bonds
as state deficits grow, Gross said the federal government is
likely to step in with additional funding if required, according
to the report.
