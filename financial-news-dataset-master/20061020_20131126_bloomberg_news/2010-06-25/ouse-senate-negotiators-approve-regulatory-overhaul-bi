             U.S. House and Senate negotiators
agreed to a final version of the regulatory-overhaul bill that
includes the most sweeping changes to rules governing Wall
Street since the Great Depression.  
 Negotiators combined each chamber’s version of the bill
after two weeks of talks, sending the bill to the House and
Senate for final votes that could come as early as next week.
