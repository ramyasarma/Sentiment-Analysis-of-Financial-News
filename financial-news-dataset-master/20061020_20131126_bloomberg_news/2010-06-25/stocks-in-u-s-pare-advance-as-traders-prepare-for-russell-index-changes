             U.S. stocks pared gains, with
consumer shares leading declines, as traders prepared to buy and
sell companies as required by the annual equity index changes
from Russell Investments.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,076.81 at 3:53 p.m. in New York, trimming its advance from
0.9 percent. Traders including  Michael Nasto  of U.S. Global
Investors Inc., which manages about $2.5 billion in San Antonio,
said the Russell’s adjustments may be spurring volatility.  
 Russell estimates that $542 billion is invested in funds
that seek to track the performance of the firm’s U.S. stock
market measures, which include the Russell 1000 Index of the
biggest American companies and the Russell 2000 of small
companies. Investors that mimic those gauges must buy and sell
shares to match Russell’s adjustments.
