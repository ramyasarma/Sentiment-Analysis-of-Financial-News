             Brazil’s real is set for a weekly
drop after a report showed inflation slowed, raising speculation
the central bank will slow the pace of interest-rate increases,
reducing demand for the local currency.  
 The real fell 0.8 percent to 1.7858 per dollar at 9:48 a.m.
New York time, from 1.7721 on June 18. The currency had gained
in the past two weeks. It dropped 0.1 percent today.  
 “The market has been very aggressive in pricing in steady
rate hikes for the next couple of months in Brazil,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an emerging-markets economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in
New York. “But inflation numbers were softer, and there are
hints of a less assertive posture toward monetary tightening,
and this might be a concern undermining interest in the real
this week.”  
 Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index rose 0.19
percent in the 30 days through June 15, compared with a 0.63
percent increase in the previous period, the government’s
statistics agency said June 22. Declines in food prices and
transport costs led to the slowdown in inflation.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.3 percent.
