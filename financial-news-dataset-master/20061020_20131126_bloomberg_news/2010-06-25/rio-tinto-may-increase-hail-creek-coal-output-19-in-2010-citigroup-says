             Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-
largest mining company, may raise output at its Hail Creek coal
mine in Australia 19 percent in 2010 because of higher demand
and an easing in infrastructure restraints, Citigroup Inc. said.  
 Production from the mine, 82 percent owned by Rio, may be
7.5 million tons this year, up from 6.3 million tons last year,
Citigroup analyst  Clarke Wilkins  said in a report dated
yesterday after visiting the mine in Queensland state. Output
next year may increase to 8 million tons, he said.  
 Output at the mine has been restricted by rail and port
bottlenecks, Wilkins said. London-based Rio may expand the mine
by opening up a new productions area, he said. Rio spokesman
 David Luff  wasn’t immediately available to comment.  
 Wilkins, who’s recommendations on Rio have produced the
best  total returns  of 15 analysts tracked by Bloomberg in the
past year, has a “buy” rating on the Rio.
