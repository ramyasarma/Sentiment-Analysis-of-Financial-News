             Rice futures fell to the lowest
price in 34 months on signs that global output is rising faster
than demand.  
 The Philippines, the biggest  importer , has enough reserves
to meet demand until the end of the year, the National Food
Authority said today. Farmers in the U.S., the fourth-largest
 exporter , planted 8.6 percent more rice this year, the
government said June 10. Prices are down more than 12 percent in
June, heading for the biggest monthly drop since January 2009.  
 “We’re headed for a period of time where supplies are
going to be rather large,” said  Dennis DeLaughter , the owner of
Progressive Farm Marketing Inc. in Edna, Texas. “I don’t know
what market signals farmers saw to plant all that extra rice.”  
 Rice futures for September delivery fell 13 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $10.21 per 100 pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $10.195, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since Aug. 16, 2007. Rice has plunged 31 percent this
year, partly because of rising production.  
 Global rice output will jump 4.3 percent in the year that
starts Aug. 1, to 459.44 million metric tons, after dropping an
estimated 1.6 percent in the current period, the USDA said in a
report June 10. Consumption will increase 2.5 percent to 452.79
million tons, the department estimated.  
 U.S. farmers will plant 3.41 million acres, up from 3.14
million a year earlier, the USDA said in a report. Thailand and
Vietnam are the biggest exporters, and both are expected to
boost output in the next marketing year, the department said.
Production in Pakistan, the No. 3 shipper, will be unchanged,
though its exports may jump 9.1 percent, the USDA said.  
 No Shortage  
 “At this particular point in time, I don’t see demand
improving,” DeLaughter said. “There’s nothing out there that
is indicating that there will be a major shortfall. We are
looking at a situation that’s going to be really tough.”  
 In the Philippines, the inventory stands at 3.56 million
tons, of which 2 million tons, or 56 percent, is held by state
agency National Food Authority, its Administrator  Jessup Navarro 
said in a statement. The agency and private importers bought a
combined 2.5 million tons of rice, a record, for this year’s
supply. Of this, more than 2.2 million tons has arrived.
