             The European Union’s Galileo
satellite navigation project needs financing of 1.5 billion
euros ($1.85 billion), on top of the already budgeted 3.4
billion euros, to become operational in 2013, Le Monde reported.  
 The French newspaper cited an estimate that it says was
recently sent by the European Commission to the European
Parliament.  
 The Italian commissioner in charge of the project, Antonio
Tajani, declined to confirm the figure, saying the amount of the
extra funding needed won’t be determined until September, Le
Monde reported.
