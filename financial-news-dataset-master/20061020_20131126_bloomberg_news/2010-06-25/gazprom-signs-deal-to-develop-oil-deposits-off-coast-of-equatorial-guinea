             OAO Gazprom Neft , the oil arm of the
world’s largest gas company, plans to produce crude off the
coast of Equatorial Guinea within four years after signing an
accord with the African nation’s state energy company today.  
 Gazprom Neft will explore two blocks with a combined 100
million metric tons of reserves, in its first offshore project,
Chief Executive Officer  Alexander Dyukov  told reporters today in
Moscow after the signing. Investment in the project may reach $3
billion in the next 25 years, he said.  
 The first exploration wells will be drilled two years after
the agreement with GEPetrol, Equatorial Guinea’s national oil
company, comes into effect, Gazprom Neft said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Peak output may reach 7 million tons a year (140,600
barrels a day), Dyukov said. Gazprom Neft will hold 80 percent
of the project during exploration. Equatorial Guinea’s GEPetrol
will own the remainder, with the right to increase its stake to
45 percent when output starts.
