             The  Bovespa  stock index advanced for
a third week as rising commodity prices boosted the outlook for
producers and a report showed consumer confidence increased in
the U.S., Brazil’s second-biggest trade partner.  
 State oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  gained for the
first time in seven days as crude prices jumped as much as 3.5
percent in New York.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA , the iron-ore
producer controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , rose
3.9 percent as a gauge of metals prices reached the highest
level this month. Steelmaker  Gerdau SA , whose top export market
is North America, reversed an earlier loss of as much as 1.7
percent after the U.S. consumer confidence report.  
 The  Bovespa  stock index rose 1.4 percent to 64,823.83 and
advanced 0.6 percent this week. Sixty stocks gained on the
measure while five fell. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap  index climbed
1.6 percent to 1,169.16. The real strengthened for a third day,
increasing 0.3 percent to 1.7790 per dollar.  
 “In Brazil, growth is great,” said  Greg Lesko , who helps
manage $800 million at Deltec Asset Management in New York.  
 Confidence among U.S. consumers rose in June to the highest
level since January 2008, indicating the decline in stock prices
prompted by the European debt crisis has failed to weigh on
sentiment. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final
index of consumer sentiment increased to 76, from 73.6 in May,
the group said today.  
 U.S. Growth  
 Brazilian  stocks  swung between gains and losses in earlier
trading after a report showed the U.S. economy grew less than
forecast, offsetting the increase in oil prices. Volume today
was the lowest this year, with 3.5 billion reais ($1.96 billion)
of equities traded, as the national soccer team faced Portugal
in a World Cup match.  
 “You have a lot going on in the U.S. and GDP was a bit
worse than people had hoped,” Lesko said.  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than previously calculated, reflecting a
smaller gain in consumer spending and a bigger trade gap.  
 The revised increase in gross domestic product was smaller
than the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News and compares with a 3 percent estimate issued last month,
figures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington.  
 Brazil’s economy expanded 9 percent in the first quarter
from the same period a year ago, the fastest pace in 15 years,
government data show.  
 Petrobras  increased 1.5 percent to 27.91 reais after crude
oil rose the most in two weeks. MMX gained 45 centavos to 12.06
reais as the  Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index 
rose 1.9 percent. Gerdau climbed 0.9 percent to 25.13 reais.  
 The Bovespa index  trades  for 12.3 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.7 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index  of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.6
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.9 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
