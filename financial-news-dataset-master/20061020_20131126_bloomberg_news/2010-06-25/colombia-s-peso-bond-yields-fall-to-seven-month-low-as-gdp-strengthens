             Colombia’s peso bonds gained,
pushing yields to their lowest level in almost seven months,
after the economy grew faster in the first quarter than analysts
forecast.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.85
percent at 3:03 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. That’s the lowest level since Dec. 1, 2009. The
bond’s price rose 0.261 centavo to 121.354 centavos per peso.  
 Gross domestic product expanded 4.4 percent in the first
quarter from the year-earlier period, led by growth in
construction and mining, the national statistics agency  said 
yesterday. That’s above the 3.6 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 24 economists.  
 “The market remains in a cheery mood after the GDP
report,” said  Alexander Cardenas , head of research at brokerage
Acciones y Valores SA in Bogota. “Higher growth points to
increased tax revenue and a lower budget deficit.” He predicts
the yield will fall to 7.7 percent by mid-July.  
 Yesterday’s report led Cardenas to revise his GDP forecast
for this year to 3.75 percent from 2.75 percent. Colombia
expects a consolidated budget deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP in
2010, the biggest since 2002.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also raised its forecast for
Colombia’s growth this year to between 4.5 percent and 5 percent
from a previous estimate of 3.8 percent, Latin America economist
 Alberto Ramos  wrote in a report yesterday.  
 ‘Recovery’  
 “The recovery of activity does not present an immediate
challenge to the inflation outlook as the economy is still
operating with some slack,” Ramos wrote. “However, the growth-
inflation trade-off is likely to turn less favorable as we get
into 2011.”  
 Colombia’s central bank may “start to gradually remove
some of the current monetary accommodation by late 2010 in order
to anchor inflation expectations and defend the 2011 inflation
target,” Ramos wrote.  
 Annual  inflation  was 2.07 percent last month, within the
central bank’s target this year of 2 percent to 4 percent. Banco
de la Republica’s  overnight lending rate  stands at a record low
of 3 percent.  
 The peso fell for a third day, declining 0.2 percent to
1,899.60 from 1,896.30 yesterday. It gained 0.5 percent this
week, the fifth consecutive weekly gain.  
 The peso will likely trade between 1,700 and 1,800 within
the next six months, RBS Securities Inc. Latin America
strategists  Siobhan Morden  and  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky  wrote in
a report today.  
 “Structural flows, the impact of a positive credit shock
on Colombian assets and a conservative foreign-exchange
intervention policy leaves downside open for USDCOP,” they
wrote.
