             Japan’s bonds fell, ending a three-
day gain, on speculation the lowest yields since 2003 will
discourage investors from buying the securities.  
 Ten-year  yields  climbed after their 14-day relative
strength index fell to 29.5 yesterday, below the 30 threshold
that some traders see as a sign the rate is poised to reverse
its declines. Bond losses were limited as the yen traded near a
five-week high against the dollar and Asian stocks fell.  
 “Yields are bound to go up somewhat as investors finish
buying at the end of the second quarter,” said  Osamu Koizumi ,
Tokyo-based chief investment officer in Tokyo at Yasuda Asset
Management Co., which manages about $7.6 billion. “People are
buying bonds not because they want to, but because they don’t
have an alternative. There’s no reason to expect 10-year yields
to go to 1.1 percent or 1 percent.”  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 rose two
basis points to 1.145 percent at the 11:05 a.m. morning close in
Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The price fell 0.182 yen to 101.387
yen. The yield reached 1.125 percent yesterday, the lowest since
Aug. 18, 2003.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.01 to
141.05 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  
 Ten-year yields have fallen 5.5 basis points this week, the
most since May 21. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “When yields extend a loss without reflecting economic
fundamentals, they will likely get a big rebound,”  Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial, a unit
of Japan’s third-largest banking group, wrote in a research note
today.  
 Yen, Stocks  
 Losses in bonds were limited as the yen touched 89.23 per
dollar yesterday, the strongest since May 21. The  Nikkei 225
Stock Average  fell 1.5 percent. The Nikkei 225 and 10-year
yields had a correlation of 0.7 in the past month, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A value of 1 would mean the two
moved in lockstep.  
 “Optimism is fading about the global economic recovery,”
said  Katsutoshi Inadome , a strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s largest banking
group. “Investors who’d thought yields would go up in June are
playing catch-up and buying before the second quarter ends.”  
 Japan’s  consumer prices  excluding fresh food slid 1.2
percent from a year earlier in May, the statistics bureau
reported today. That was a 15th-consecutive drop. Deflation
enhances the value of the fixed payments on debt.  
 Five-year inflation bonds  yield  0.9 percentage points more
than similar-maturity regular notes, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Inflation-adjusted securities typically yield less
than regular bonds because their principal payment increases at
the same rate as inflation.
