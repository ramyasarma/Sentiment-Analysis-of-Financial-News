             Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s
largest tiremaker, rose the most in Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average after the company boosted its first-half profit forecast,
citing higher revenue and overseas prices.  
 The Tokyo-based tiremaker advanced 2.9 percent to 1,516 yen
as of 9:18 a.m. on the Tokyo stock exchange. The Nikkei 225
dropped 1.6 percent.  
 Net income will probably climb 37 percent to 37 billion yen
($413 million) in the six months ending June 30, beating a
previous projection of 27 billion yen, Bridgestone said in a
statement to the Tokyo bourse yesterday.  
 Full-year profit may jump to 77 billion yen from 1.04
billion yen in the previous year, Bridgestone said.
