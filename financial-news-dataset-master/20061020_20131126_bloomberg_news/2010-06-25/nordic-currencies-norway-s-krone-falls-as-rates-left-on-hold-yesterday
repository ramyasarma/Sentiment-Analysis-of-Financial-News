             Norway’s krone headed for its second
weekly decline versus the euro after the central bank yesterday
said it would increase the key interest  rate  more slowly than
originally projected given the weaker European economy.  
 The krone today reached the weakest level in almost a
month. The Norges Bank kept the benchmark rate at 2 percent and
said it will average 1.75 percent in 2010, compared with a 2
percent average estimate in its last monetary policy report on
March 24. Sweden’s krona rose today ahead of a July 1 meeting
where the nation’s central bank will probably increase  rates  a
quarter percentage point to 0.5 percent.  
 The Norges Bank “downshifted its conditional interest rate
path, which had the expected negative effect on the krone,”
 Michael Hart , a London-based currency strategist at Citigroup
Inc., said in a note yesterday. “However, in a global
environment where central banks are generally back-pedalling on
previous commitments to tighten policy, the krone is likely to
eventually catch up on the back of its more robust
fundamentals.”  
 The krone was at 8.0032 per euro as of 1:35 p.m. in Oslo
from 8.0095 late yesterday in New York. It earlier touched
8.0388 per euro, the weakest since May 27. The currency was down
1.6 percent this week. Sweden’s krona rose 0.4 percent to 9.5691
per euro and was little changed from 9.5763 on June 18.  
 The Stockholm-based Riksbank will raise its benchmark  repo
rate  to 0.5 percent, according to the median estimate of 15
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. One respondent didn’t
predict a raise, while another economist forecast a 50
percentage point increase to 0.75 percent, the survey showed.  
 The Norwegian krone was the worst performer among the 16
most-traded currencies in the last five days.
