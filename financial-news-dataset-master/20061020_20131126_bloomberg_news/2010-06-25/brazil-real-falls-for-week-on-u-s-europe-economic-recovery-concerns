             Brazil’s real had its first weekly
drop since June 4 after a U.S. report showed the world’s largest
economy grew less than earlier estimated.  
 The real weakened 0.5 percent to 1.7802 per dollar from
1.7721 on June 18. The currency gained in the past two weeks and
rose 0.2 percent today.  
 The U.S. Commerce Department said the economy grew 2.7
percent in the first quarter, less than the 3 percent estimate
reported last month. U.S. companies from Dell Inc. to Nike Inc.
and Research In Motion Ltd. gave forecasts or reported results
that disappointed some investors. Speculation that the Group of
20 summit this weekend will fail to agree on ways to tackle
Europe’s debt crisis contributed to the European stocks.  
 ‘In the short run it’s all about correlation in the global
markets,” said  Igor Arsenin , a strategist with Credit Suisse AG
in New York. “In the U.S. they’re looking at employment numbers
and the housing markets, in Europe the widening of the Greece
spread, and in general the news has been particularly
negative.”  
 Purchases of U.S. new homes fell in May to the lowest level
on record. Sales collapsed an unprecedented 33 percent from
April to an annual pace of 300,000, less than the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the fewest
in data going back to 1963.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold Greek government
debt instead of German bonds increased to a seven-week high
yesterday as growing concern that the economic recovery may be
slowing drove investors to the safest assets.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 11.30 percent.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  of U.S. stocks fell 3.6
percent for its biggest weekly decline since May 21. The  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index  dropped 2.8 percent for its first weekly
decline in five weeks.
