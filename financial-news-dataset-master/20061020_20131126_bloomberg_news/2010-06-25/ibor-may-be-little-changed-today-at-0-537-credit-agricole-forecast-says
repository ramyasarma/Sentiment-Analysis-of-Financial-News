             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in dollars may be little changed today,
according to Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may be 0.537 percent, said Orlando Green, a fixed-income
strategist in London. The rate was 0.537 percent yesterday, data
from the British Bankers’ Association showed.
