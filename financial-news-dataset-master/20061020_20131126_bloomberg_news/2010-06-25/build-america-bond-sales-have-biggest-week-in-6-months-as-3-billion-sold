             Build America weekly issuance more
than doubled to $3.34 billion, the most since December, as
investor demand pushed yields on such debt to the lowest in
almost two weeks.  
 The  average yield  of Build America Bonds fell almost 2
basis points to 5.89 percent on June 23, the lowest since June
11, according to a Wells Fargo index. Higher issuance also
helped boost overall debt sales by states and municipalities to
a six-week high of $8.9 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 In the week ended Dec. 11, $3.98 billion of the taxable
securities were sold, according to Bloomberg data. This week’s
total is the fourth-highest since the program’s inception. The
record week ended Aug. 21 with $4.22 billion of such obligations
issued.  
 “Municipalities need the money, they need to borrow and
Build America is an easy funding mechanism,” said  Tom Boylen , a
managing director and municipal-bond trader in Chicago for BMO
Capital Markets. “The funding needs of this country are still
extremely high. For investors, staying outside of cash is the
only way you’re going to pick up any income.”  
 Yields  on top-rated tax-exempts maturing in 2020 fell 1
basis point yesterday to 3.16 percent, the lowest in two weeks,
according to Municipal Market Advisors, as buyers were more
particular with their investments, Boylen said.  
 Ten-year government  yields  headed for a weekly decline of 8
basis points to 3.14 percent.  
 Yield Spread  
 The  yield-spread  between the average Build America Bond and
the 30-year  U.S. Treasury  has widened 37 basis points to 178
basis points since May 6, according to Bloomberg data.  
 “There’s still an advantage to using BABs even though
spreads have widened,” said  Alan Schankel , head of fixed-income
research at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.  
 The  Bay Area Toll Authority , which is  financing  the new  San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge , sold $1.5 billion of Build
Americas yesterday, the biggest sale since March.  
 The $250 million in debt maturing in 2030 priced to yield
6.79 percent, 275 basis points above the benchmark 30-year
Treasury for the deal. The $400 million due in 2040 was 287.5
basis points more than the benchmark, and the $850 million
maturing in 2050 yielded 7.04 percent, 300 basis points above.  
 After the 35 percent interest rebate from the U.S.
government, the bonds maturing in 2040 will cost the authority
4.5 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Top-rated  30-year debt 
yielded 4.55 percent yesterday, according to Concord-
Massachusetts-based MMA.  
 A two-year extension of the Build America program is
included in a Senate bill awaiting action. Passed by the House
of Representatives May 28, the provision would cut federal
subsidies to borrowers to 32 percent in 2011 and 30 percent in
2012.  
 Following are descriptions of pending sales of municipal
debt in the U.S.:

agency that provides low-cost loans for local water projects,

with the remainder coming as tax-exempts. Underwriters led by
