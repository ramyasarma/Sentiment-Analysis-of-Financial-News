             The Spanish government postponed its
plan to cut the price earned by renewable power plants after the
main opposition party agreed to negotiate a broader accord on
energy policy.  
 The government opted to delay the decision so subsidies for
solar and wind energy can be included in talks aimed at securing
an energy agreement with the People’s Party, an industry
ministry spokesman said today in a telephone interview.  
 The negotiations will also address nuclear power and energy
efficiency as well as introduce more market mechanisms into the
power network, said the spokesman, who asked not to be named in
line with local practice.  
 Solar-energy executives said Industry Minister  Miguel Sebastian  told them this week he intends to cut the subsidized
revenue that photovoltaic plants earn by 30 percent as part of a
plan to reduce the cost of power. The government wants to boost
Spanish industry competitiveness and curb public liabilities to
help revive the economy after the worst recession in 60 years.  
 The government has until the end of the year to decide on a
new pricing structure for emissions-free electricity and aims to
finalize a proposal as soon as possible, the ministry spokesman
said. Officials had aimed to publish a draft proposal by July 1.
