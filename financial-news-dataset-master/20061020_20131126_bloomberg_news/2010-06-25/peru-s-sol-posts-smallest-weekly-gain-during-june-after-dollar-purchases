             Peru’s sol registered its smallest
weekly advance in June after the central bank stepped up dollar
 purchases  and increased bank reserve mandates.  
 The sol strengthened 0.1 percent this week to 2.8265 per
U.S. dollar, from 2.8285 on June 18. The currency also rose in
the prior two weeks. It was unchanged today.  
 Peru’s central bank resumed its intervention policy June 18
after a two-month pause as the sol climbed to a 22-month high.
The bank this week raised reserve requirements for banks’
foreign currency accounts and borrowings abroad from July.
Policy makers increased the benchmark  lending rate  by a quarter-
percentage point to 1.75 percent on June 10, boosting demand for
the country’s fixed-income assets.  
 “The central bank raised deposit requirements for foreign
credit of less than two years to deter speculative capital,”
said  Roberto Flores , economist at Lima-based Inteligo SAB. “A
significant portion of the dollar flows into the market come
from foreign investors attracted by Peru’s healthy macroeconomic
outlook.”  
 The central bank bought $424 million in the last week,
including $18 million today, the smallest purchase since March
19.  
 International reserves of $35.5 billion as of June 21 will
allow the central bank to continue buying dollars to slow the
sol’s appreciation, Flores said.
