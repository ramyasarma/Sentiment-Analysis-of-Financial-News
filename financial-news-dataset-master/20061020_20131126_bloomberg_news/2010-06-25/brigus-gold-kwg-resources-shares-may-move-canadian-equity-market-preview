             Canadian stocks  fell as energy
prices declined on forecasts that a tropical storm may not
affect oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 EnCana Corp., Canada’s largest natural gas producer,
dropped 2.7 percent as the fuel retreated. Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest fertilizer producer, lost
3.3 percent on declining agricultural-commodity prices. Teck
Resources Ltd., the country’s biggest base-metals producer, fell
3.8 percent as a stronger U.S. dollar weakened copper prices.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  lost 100.85
points, or 0.9 percent, to a two-week low of 11,607. The index
has slipped 3.6 percent this quarter, less than all but five of
23 other developed markets’ primary indexes, as natural gas
surged 22 percent. The fuel slumped 3 percent today, while oil
futures declined 0.8 percent, as forecasts showed Tropical Storm
Alex heading to the Mexico coast rather than energy producing
areas of the Gulf.  
 “If there was a potential threat to or disruption to
supply because of a hurricane, the price of natural gas may move
up, and natural gas-sensitive stocks such as EnCana may move
up,” said  Robert McWhirter , who oversees C$140 million ($136
million) as a money manager at Selective Asset Management Inc.
in Toronto.  
 Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas company,
fell 0.8 percent to C$33. Talisman Energy Inc., which operates
in  North America, the North Sea and Indonesia , dropped 1.9
percent to C$16.92. EnCana declined 2.7 percent to C$33.12.  
 Downgrade  
 Potash Corp. retreated 3.3 percent to an eight-month low of
C$95.02 as corn prices fell for a sixth day, the longest slump
in three months. Weather forecasts called for dry conditions
after parts of the U.S. Midwest got more than 9 inches (22
centimeters) of rain in the past two weeks.  
 Producers of metals used in industry fell as copper dropped
from a four-week high. Teck decreased 3.8 percent to C$33.68.
First Quantum Minerals Ltd., Canada’s second-largest copper
producer, declined 3.8 percent to C$58.23. Lundin Mining Corp.,
which mines copper and zinc in Europe, lost 4.6 percent to
C$3.31.  
 Empire Co., Canada’s second-largest grocer, rallied 3.3
percent to C$52.75 after releasing quarterly financial results
June 25. Analyst  Ken Chernin  of Jennings Capital Inc. raised his
12-month price estimate on the stock to C$58 from C$56, while
 James Durran  of National Bank of Canada increased his price
estimate to C$61 from C$59.
