             Investor  Jim Rogers , chairman of
Rogers Holdings, said the threat of inflation is “extremely
serious” and the world is in an ongoing bear market for
financial assets.  
 Rogers, who predicted the start of the global commodities
rally in 1999, is betting on a decline in stocks and gains in
commodities, he said today in an interview with Bloomberg-UTV in
Mumbai. He’s also bought the euro and the U.S. dollar and said
agricultural commodities are “extremely cheap” on an
historical basis.  
 The Federal Reserve this week said Europe’s debt crisis
may hinder growth in the U.S., the world’s largest economy.
Global stock markets have plunged amid the fallout from the
European crisis, which saw euro nations and the International
Monetary Fund back up Greece with an almost $1 trillion bailout.  
 “The world has an ongoing economic problem which has not
yet been resolved yet,” Rogers said today. “I don’t think the
best place for people to invest is in stocks.”  
 Asian stocks dropped the most in nearly three weeks today
on disappointing sales and earnings forecasts by U.S. companies.
The  MSCI World Index  of the largest companies has lost about 13
percent of its value from a more than two-year high in April.  
 “I am still concerned about debt around the world,”
Rogers said. “I am not terribly optimistic about the world
economy partially, largely, because of the gigantic debts which
have built up.”  
 Rogers said he’s not optimistic about the euro or the U.S.
dollar in the “long term.” Sugar and silver are cheap on an
historical basis, Rogers said.
