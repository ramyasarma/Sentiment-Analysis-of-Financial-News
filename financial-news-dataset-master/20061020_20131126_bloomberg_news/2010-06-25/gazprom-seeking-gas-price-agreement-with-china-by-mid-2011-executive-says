             OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export
monopoly, is seeking to agree on prices and supply terms with
China by mid-2011, allowing for the first deliveries four years
later, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Alexander Medvedev said at
the company’s annual meeting today in Moscow.  
 Gazprom had initially set 2011 as a target for shipping its
first pipeline gas to China, later moving the timeframe to 2014
to 2015.
