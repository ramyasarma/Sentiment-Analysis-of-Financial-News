             Renova Energia SA , a Brazilian
renewable energy company, may raise 74 percent less than
originally planned as it revives the initial public offering it
shelved in March.  
 Renova may raise as much as 229.5 million reais ($128.7
million) in the offering, compared with the 867.9 million reais
it originally sought.  
 The company, based in Sao Paulo, is seeking to sell 10
million units representing voting and preferred shares, and may
offer an additional 3.5 million units, according to a prospectus
published in Valor Economico newspaper today. The share price is
estimated at 15 reais to 17 reais.  
 Renova’s reduced offering comes after OSX Brasil SA, the
oil-services and shipbuilding company controlled by billionaire
 Eike Batista , in March cut its IPO by 67 percent, citing a
“difficult” market. Earlier this month, WTorre Properties SA
put its planned share sale on hold because of  market volatility 
and “uncertainties surrounding the European situation.” The
benchmark Bovespa stock index has  dropped 6.8 percent  this year.  
 Renova said it expects the shares to be priced on July 8,
with trading to begin on July 13. Banco Santander (Brasil) SA is
managing the sale with Banco Merrill Lynch de Investimentos SA,
according to the prospectus.
