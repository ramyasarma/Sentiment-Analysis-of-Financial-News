             The death toll from China’s
deadliest coal mine accident this year rose to 48 as the state
safety department revised its count of the number of workers
present in the pit when the accident happened.  
 Twenty-eight miners survived the blast on June 21 at a pit
in Pingdingshan city in the central province of Henan, according
to the latest  tally  by the State Administration of Work Safety.
At least 76 workers were in the mine at the time, it said in a
statement on its website.  
 China has the world’s worst coal-mine safety record, with
an average of seven deaths each day in accidents last year. That
compares with 18 deaths for an entire year in the U.S. The worst
Chinese coal-mine disaster in two years killed more than 100 in
November after an explosion in the northeastern province of
Heilongjiang. In March, a coal mine flood in the northern Shanxi
province trapped 153 workers, killing 38.
