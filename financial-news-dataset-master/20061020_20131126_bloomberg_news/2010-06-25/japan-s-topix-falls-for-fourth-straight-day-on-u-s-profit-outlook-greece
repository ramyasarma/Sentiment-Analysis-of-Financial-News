             Japanese  stocks  fell, dragging down
the Topix index for a fourth straight day, as analyst rating
cuts and U.S. profit forecasts raised concern about the strength
of the recovery in the economy and earnings.  
 Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 80 percent of
its revenue outside Japan, tumbled 4.5 percent after Credit
Suisse Group AG cut its investment rating.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. ,
the world’s second-largest maker of semiconductor equipment,
plunged 5.6 percent on brokerage downgrades and after Dell Inc.
forecast profit that was less than some analysts estimated.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. dropped 1.3 percent on speculation
it will sell new shares.  
 “Expectations that the global economy is on the road to
recovery seem to be peaking out,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , a fund
manager in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $6 billion. “The cloudy economic outlook makes the market
more sensitive to bad news such as rating cuts.”  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.9 percent to 9,737.48
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, the biggest decline among equity
benchmarks in the Asia-Pacific region. The gauge closed below
10,000 for the sixth consecutive week.  
 The broader  Topix  lost 1.4 percent to 867.30, with all but
4 of its 33 industry groups declining. The number of shares
traded was the highest since June 11. For the week, the Nikkei
has dropped 2.6 percent, and the Topix is down 2 percent.  
 Topix Valuations  
 The Topix has slumped 4.4 percent this year, compared with
drops of 3.7 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese
benchmark are valued at 16.7 times estimated  earnings , versus
13.2 times for the S&P 500 and 11.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  
 Japan’s consumer prices fell at a slower pace in May than
in April, the statistics bureau said today, a moderation that
may be insufficient to ease government pressure on the central
bank to fight deflation.  
 In New York yesterday, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  lost
1.7 percent, led by consumer shares. Banks dropped on concern
about financial regulation. Credit-default swaps on Greece rose
38 basis points yesterday to an all-time high of 970 basis
points, according to CMA DataVision.  
 Mizuho , Japan’s third-biggest bank by market value, slumped
1.3 percent to 153 yen and was the country’s most-active stock
by value. The company will sell as many as 6 billion new shares,
a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The sale
would be worth 930 billion yen ($10.4 billion), based on
yesterday’s closing price.  
 Canon, Yen  
 Canon, which is the world’s largest camera maker and counts
Europe as its biggest market, slumped 4.5 percent to 3,530 yen
today and was the  biggest contributor  to the Topix’s drop.
Credit Suisse cut its rating to “underperform” from
“neutral” on concern the stronger yen will crimp earnings.  
 The yen appreciated to its highest level this month against
the dollar yesterday and reached 89.42 today, reducing the value
of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into
their home currency. Against the euro, it strengthened to 110.04
from 110.76. Canon based its budget on 90 yen per dollar and 125
yen per euro, the company said in April.  
 Tokyo Electron  plunged 5.6 percent to 5,220 yen, the most
since Oct. 28, after Credit Suisse and Mizuho Securities Co.
reduced their ratings on the stock to “neutral” from
“outperform.”  
 Elpida, Dainippon, Disco  
 Other chip-related shares also retreated after Mizuho cut
ratings, saying 2011 will see excess supply of dynamic random-
access memory.  Elpida Memory Inc.  sank 8.4 percent to 1,401 yen,
the lowest close since Dec. 22. Dainippon Screen Manufacturing
Co. tumbled 8.7 percent, and Disco Corp. lost 4.5 percent.  
 Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of chip-testing
equipment, dropped 3.7 percent to 1,949 yen after its share
price estimate was reduced at Credit Suisse.  
 Dell , the world’s third-largest maker of personal computers,
fell the most in the S&P 500 yesterday after the company said
this week it expects fiscal 2011 revenue will increase to
between $60.31 billion and $62.95 billion, compared with an
estimate of $61.79 billion by analysts.  
 “The U.S. economy has begun to see signs of fragility at
the company level,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist in Tokyo at Tachibana Securities Co. “Companies that
rely on overseas sales will likely be the focus of selling.”  
 Fanuc Ltd., a maker of industrial robots that earns about
17 percent of its revenue in Europe, fell 4.6 percent to 10,500
yen and was the heaviest drag on the Nikkei 225.  Olympus Corp. ,
an endoscope maker that earns 21 percent of its sales in Europe,
slumped 2.5 percent to 2,213 yen, a level not seen since July 21.
Nippon Sheet Glass Co., a glassmaker that counts Europe as its
biggest market, lost 4.5 percent to 232 yen.  
 “There’s a flow of bad news almost every day, so I feel
reluctant to buy stocks even when some shares look relatively
cheap,” said  Masatsugu Okeya , a fund manager at Chiba-Gin Asset
Management Co. “People aren’t well positioned to invest
actively. They seem to be trying to avoid risks.”
