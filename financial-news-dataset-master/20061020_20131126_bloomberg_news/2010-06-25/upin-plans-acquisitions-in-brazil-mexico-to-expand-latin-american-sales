             Lupin Ltd. , an Indian generic-drug
maker, is looking for acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico to
expand its revenue from the Latin American region.  
 The company plans to spend $50 million to $75 million on
each purchase, said S. Ramesh, president of finance and planning,
in an interview in Mumbai today. Lupin is looking for companies
that have a strong marketing relationship with physicians and
will make the acquisitions soon, he said, without providing a
more specific timeframe.  
 Lupin generates 10 percent of revenue from a sales region
that includes Latin America and Europe, Ramesh said. The Mumbai-
based drugmaker, whose  financial statement  doesn’t break out
revenue from countries outside India, also plans to make a
second purchase in Japan after  acquiring control  of Kyowa
Pharmaceutical Industry Co., the executive said.  
 “Latin America is the next stop for us, in so far as of
acquisitions,” he said. “Recognition with the doctor is the
most important” consideration for the purchases, Ramesh said.
