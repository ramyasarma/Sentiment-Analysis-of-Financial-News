             China, the largest cotton user,
will raise its import quota for the natural fiber by almost 1
million metric tons and sell more from state stockpiles to
quench a supply shortfall, the  China Cotton Association  said.  
 The State Council has approved additional import quotas,
bringing the total amount for 2010 to about 3.6 million tons,
the association said. The government has also approved a plan
to sell 600,000 tons from stockpiles, and “waiting for an
opportune time to release the supplies,” it said.  
 Cotton has climbed 39 percent in the past year as global
production dropped and demand recovered. China faces a cotton
shortage of about 310,000 metric tons before new domestic
supplies come onto the market after India halted exports and
demand climbed, the State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission said on April 27.  
 “The government has basically confirmed that the cotton
supply will continue to be tight and delayed planting in spring
has made the situation worse because it will push back the time
when new crop cotton becomes available,”  Dong Shuzhi ,
assistant general manager at Jinshi Futures Co., said by phone
from Shanghai today.  
 The delayed planting in spring has led to weak seedlings
and late development of the crop, the cotton association said.
China has already issued 1.89 million tons in quotas at the
beginning of this year and another 800,000 tons in May.  
 Consumption Growth  
 China’s cotton consumption is estimated at 10.34 million
tons in the 2009-2010 season and production to fall to 7.1
million tons, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  
 Cotton-yarn prices have risen faster than cotton this year,
increasing demand for the raw material and boosting profits for
textile mills, Dong said. Cotton for December delivery rose 0.3
percent to 78.99 cents a pound on ICE Futures in New York at
4:46 p.m. in Shanghai.  
 “The global market is tight too, so the additional import
quota isn’t going to help much,” Dong said.  
 The U.S., the largest cotton exporter, will see its
inventories at the end of July become smaller than forecast
last month because of increased exports, the USDA said on June
10. Stockpiles on July 31, 2011, at the end of next marketing
year, will be 2.8 million bales, or 17 percent of total use and
the smallest stock level  since 1995-1996 , it said. A running
bale weighs 500 pounds or 227 kilograms.  
 Imports Jump  
 China will need another 2.7 million tons of cotton in the
three months between July and September, consuming 900,000 tons
a month, according to Dong’s estimate. Cotton imports have more
than doubled in the first five months to 1.4 million tons,
according to customs  data .  
 Planting delays due to cold weather in Xinjiang, China’s
biggest producer, may slow the availability of the new crop,
Dong said. Nationwide harvesting may be delayed until October,
up to 20 days later than normal, Dong said.  
 “Given that the government will sell 600,000 tons, and we
estimate commercial inventories at 1.8 million tons, the
country is still short by about several hundred thousand tons
before the start of a new crop year,” he said.
