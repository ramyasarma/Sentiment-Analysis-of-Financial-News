             Gold rose for a second day in New
York on speculation that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will
worsen, boosting demand for bullion as a haven.  
 The euro headed for a weekly loss as Group of 20 leaders
prepared to meet this weekend in Toronto to discuss Europe’s
financial woes. The cost of protecting Greece’s debt from
default rose to a record. Gold reached an all-time high of
$1,266.50 an ounce on June 21.  
 “Gold rallying is indicative of investor skittishness,”
said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock in Chicago. “We still have debt overseas and an
economic slowdown. Investors are uncomfortable holding paper
assets.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August rose $9, or 0.7
percent, to $1,254.90 at 10:50 a.m. on the Comex in New York,
narrowing the first weekly loss since mid-May. Earlier, the
price touched $1,258, the highest level in four days.  
 Gold has risen 14 percent in 2010, after posting nine
annual gains, as investors sought an alternative to holding
currencies. The metal reached records this month in euros,
sterling and Swiss francs.  
 “With European debt fears at the forefront again and U.S.
rates set to remain low for some time, gold will likely gain
further support,” said  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London.  
 This week, the Federal Reserve kept the U.S. benchmark
 interest rate  between zero and 0.25 percent, where it’s been
since December 2008.  
 G-20 Gathering  
 G-20 leaders will meet in Toronto tomorrow and June 27 to
discuss policies aimed at addressing Europe’s crisis, spurring
global growth and overhauling financial regulation. Credit-
default swaps on Greece rose to an all-time high today,
according to CMA DataVision. European equities slipped for a
fourth day.  
 Silver futures for September delivery gained 14.4 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $18.92 an ounce on the Comex. Platinum futures
for October delivery slipped 20 cents to $1,568 an ounce on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Palladium futures for September
delivery fell 35 cents to $469.65 an ounce.
