             Mumbai  received the highest June 
monsoon rainfall in almost two decades, helping ease a water
shortage in India’s commercial capital.  
 South Mumbai recorded 909.6 millimeters (35.8 inches) of rain
from June 1 to June 25, the most since 1991, and precipitation in
the suburbs was 643.8 millimeters, the most since at least 2008, data
from the  India Meteorological Department  show.  
 Consistent rainfall over the catchment areas of six lakes
supplying water to the city of 18 million people may prompt the
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to end water cuts of as much as
30 percent imposed last year after the driest monsoon showers in four
decades drained reservoirs. The city got 3,300 million liters a day
before the supplies were pared.  
 Mumbai, the capital of the Maharashtra state, the nation’s biggest
producer of sugar and second-largest grower of cotton, got 210
millimeters in the 24 hours ended 8:30 a.m. today, the weather agency
said, predicting heavy rainfall with gusty winds. The municipal
corporation’s Disaster Management Cell said there has been no flooding
in the city, Press Trust of India said, without citing anyone.  
 The city received 949 millimeters of rain on July 26, 2005, the
heaviest downpour anywhere in India in a century. The deluge killed
more than 400 people, grounded flights and cut road and rail links.
Mumbai, home to the nation’s central bank and stock and commodity
 exchanges , has a century-old drainage system that makes it susceptible
to flooding during the rainy season.  
 Beating Forecast  
 India’s June-to-September monsoon rains may be 102 percent of
the 50-year average, exceeding the 98 percent forecast by the weather
bureau in April, Junior Food Minister K.V. Thomas told reporters in
New Delhi today.  
 Adequate rains may help output of rice, sugar and oilseeds after
a drought last year spurred record imports, and increase water levels
in reservoirs used by farmers to irrigate about 40 percent of the
nation’s crop land and to grow winter crops, such as wheat and barley.  
 Storage levels in the nation’s 81 main reservoirs climbed to
18.282 billion cubic meters, more than double last year’s volume and
89 percent of the average of the past 10 years, the central water
commission said on its [bn:URL= http://www.cwc.gov.in/bulletin (2).pdf

 The weather office is scheduled to announce a revision to its
forecast at 4 p.m. local time.
