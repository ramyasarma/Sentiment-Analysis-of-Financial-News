             OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, would consider buying a stake in
Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz field in the Caspian Sea if offered,
Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  said.  
 “We haven’t received any proposals on the sale of the
stake in this project,” Miller said in Moscow today. “If we
receive such an offer, we will consider it.”  
 Gazprom would also consider entering exploration and
production projects with companies it has swap deals with, as
well as “companies from the Persian Gulf,” Miller said. The
Russian company has swapped pipeline gas with BP Plc, which
holds 25.5 percent of Shah Deniz, in return for cargoes of
liquefied natural gas.  
 Shah Deniz, the biggest gas field in Azerbaijan, now pumps
fuel into the BP-operated South Caucasus Pipeline through
Turkey. Gas from the second phase of the field’s development is
planned to help feed the 7.9 billion-euro ($9.72 billion)
Nabucco pipeline from Turkey into central Europe led by
Austria’s OMV AG. The pipeline would avoid Russian territory and
open up the so-called southern corridor into Europe.  
 Other partners in Shah Deniz are Statoil ASA with 25.5
percent, State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan with 10 percent, OAO Lukoil
with 10 percent, Naftiran Intertrade Co. with 10 percent, Total
SA with 10 percent and Turkiye Petrolleri AO with 9 percent.
