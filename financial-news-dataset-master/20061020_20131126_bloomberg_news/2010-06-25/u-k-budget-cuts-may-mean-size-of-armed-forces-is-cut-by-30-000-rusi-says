             U.K. government plans to cut
departmental budgets to reduce the nation’s deficit might lead
to cuts of 30,000 military personnel, according to the  Royal
United Services Institute .  
 In his June 22 budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said most government departments would have to find
savings of as much as 25 percent. He exempted the defense
ministry while it conducts a review into Britain’s strategic
defense requirements, due this fall.  
 In a paper published today, Malcolm Chalmers of London-
based RUSI estimated the core defense budget could be cut by as
much as 15 percent in real terms over the next four years.  
 “Given the difficulties involved in making sharp and rapid
reductions in procurement spending, the personnel budget will
have to bear a significant share of this cut,” Chalmers said in
the research paper published on RUSI’s website.  
 “It is therefore projected that there may have to be a
reduction of around 15 per cent in total Ministry of Defence
personnel numbers, including cuts of 30,000 in military
personnel and 13,000 in the number of Ministry of Defence-
employed civilians,” he wrote.  
 There were 191,000 members of the armed forces on April 1
this year, according to  statistics from the ministry .
