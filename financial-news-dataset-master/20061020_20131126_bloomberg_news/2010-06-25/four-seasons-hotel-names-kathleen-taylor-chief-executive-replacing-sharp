             Four Seasons Hotels Inc. said
 Kathleen Taylor , a 21-year veteran of the luxury lodging chain,
will replace founder  Isadore Sharp  as chief executive officer.  
 Sharp, 78, will remain chairman and continue to oversee
hotel design, the Toronto-based company said in a statement
today. The change is effective Aug. 1.  
 Luxury hotels, which were hurt most by a decline in
business and leisure travel during the global recession, are
starting to show signs of recovery. Taylor, currently president
and chief operating officer, said earlier this month that
nightly rates at some Four Seasons properties may climb to the
peak levels of 2008 by the end of this year.  
 “Four Seasons is well positioned to take advantage of the
recovery in luxury travel,” Taylor said in today’s statement.  
 Taylor, 52, joined Four Seasons in 1989 and has served as
president and chief operating officer since 2007. She will
retain her title as president.  
 “As an investor in Four Seasons since 1994, I have had the
opportunity to work closely with Katie for more than 15 years
and know she will steer the company to ongoing success,” said
Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, chairman of Kingdom Hotels
International, in the statement.  
 Kingdom Hotels, together with Cascade Investment LLC, a
company owned by  Bill Gates , and Triples Holdings Ltd., owned by
Sharp, took Four Seasons private in 2007.  
 Sharp started Four Seasons as a motor inn in Toronto in
1961. Today the chain has 82 properties under its brand.
