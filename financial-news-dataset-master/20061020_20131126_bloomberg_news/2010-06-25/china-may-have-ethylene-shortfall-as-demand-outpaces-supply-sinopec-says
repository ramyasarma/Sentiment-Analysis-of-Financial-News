             China, the world’s fastest-growing
major economy, may have a shortfall of ethylene by 2015 as
demand growth for the plastic raw material outstrips increases
in capacity, according to the nation’s top oil refiner.  
 Consumption may rise 4.5 percent a year to 29 million
metric tons by 2015 while production capacity reaches 20 million
tons,  China Petrochemical Corp. , also known as Sinopec Group,
said in its company  newsletter  today.  
 Industrial production in China, the world’s second-biggest
energy user, jumped 16.5 percent in May, spurring consumption of
ethylene, used to make products from pipes to shopping bags.
Global ethylene demand is forecast to grow an average 5.5
percent each year to 152.4 million tons per annum by 2015, the
International Energy Agency said June 23.  
 Sinopec Group’s ethylene capacity reached 9.3 million tons
a year as of the end of April, accounting for 64 percent of the
nation’s total, according to today’s statement. Average capacity
at the company’s ethylene-making units was 620,000 tons, it said.
PetroChina Co.’s output capacity makes up 29 percent of China’s
total, the company’s parent, China National Petroleum Corp.,
said on May 11.  
 The Middle East will account for 36 percent of new capacity
to be added by 2015 and northeast Asia will make up 35 percent,
the IEA said in June.
