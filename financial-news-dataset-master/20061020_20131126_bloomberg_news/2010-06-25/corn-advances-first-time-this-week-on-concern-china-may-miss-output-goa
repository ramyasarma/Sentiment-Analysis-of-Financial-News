             Corn futures advanced in Chicago
for the first time this week on concern China, the world’s
second-largest consumer, may miss an output forecast,
potentially boosting imports. Wheat and soybeans also gained.  
 Corn for December delivery gained as much as 0.4 percent
to $3.66 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. It was at
$3.655 a bushel at 3:20 p.m. Singapore time, narrowing the
weekly loss to 3.9 percent.  
 China may miss an output target of 168 million metric tons
in the year beginning October if dry weather persists in the
central and northeastern growing areas, Bryce Anderson, chief
agricultural meteorologist at Telvent DTN Inc. said in a phone
interview today.  
 “Current hotter and drier weather in northern China,
which people say is more severe than last year, may be a key
driver in the future for the market as less production will
drive the country to  import  more grain,” Takaki Shigemoto, an
analyst at research and investment company JSC Corp. in Tokyo,
said today by phone.  
 China’s corn harvest faces the risk of damage in the same
marketing year as U.S. inventories at the end of 2010-2011 were
estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to drop to the
lowest since 2006-2007. The U.S. is forecast to account for 57
percent of global corn exports this year, according to the USDA.  
 Production concerns in China “underpin our feeling that
the complex is cheap,”  Jonathan Barratt , managing director at
Commodity Broking Services Pty said in an e-mail today. “It
also goes to show how important the weather cycle is
becoming.”  
 Lower Stockpiles  
 The USDA on June 10 lowered its global stockpile  estimate 
by 4.7 percent to 147.32 million tons at the end of the 2010-
2011 marketing year, as it pared its U.S. inventory forecast by
13 percent from a month earlier.  
 “If it gets worse, this will lead the USDA to revise its
stockpile estimates lower,” JSC’s Shigemoto said. The USDA is
scheduled to release its latest forecast on global supply and
demand on July 9.  
 Corn consumption for use in domestic feed in South Korea,
the world’s third-largest buyer of the grain, is forecast to
climb by 300,000 to 400,000 tons to about 6.3 million tons this
year, as the recovering economy boosts meat consumption, Lee
Young Il, general manager for the foreign trade team, said in
an interview in Seoul yesterday.  
 September-delivery wheat was little changed at $4.78 a
bushel. Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$9.1875 a bushel, trimming the weekly loss to 1.3 percent.
