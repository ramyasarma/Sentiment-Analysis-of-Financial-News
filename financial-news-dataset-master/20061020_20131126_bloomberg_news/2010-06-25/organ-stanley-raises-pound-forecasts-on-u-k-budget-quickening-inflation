             Morgan Stanley raised its 2010 and
2011 forecasts for the pound against the dollar and the euro,
citing this week’s U.K. budget and the outlook that inflation
in the British economy may accelerate.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne unveiled an
emergency budget on June 22 including a levy on banks, a higher
sales tax and spending cuts. The plan, together with measures
proposed by the previous government, will generate 113 billion
pounds ($169 billion) of deficit cuts, 15 percent of the 737
billion-pound budget foreseen for 2015, the Treasury said.  
 “In light of the proactive budget and the higher
inflation profile, we are adjusting our pound forecasts to show
a more neutral outlook,”  Emma Lawson , a London-based currency
strategist at the U.S. bank, wrote in a research note yesterday.  
 Morgan Stanley said the pound may trade at $1.43 by the
end of 2010 and at $1.52 by the end of 2011, compared with
previous projections of $1.29 and $1.41, respectively. The
pound may rise to 81 pence per euro by year-end and to 77 pence
by the end of 2011, from earlier estimates of 90 pence and 83
pence, respectively, according to the note.  
 The pound traded at $1.4939 as of 11:05 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.4935 in New York yesterday, when it climbed to $1.5012, the
highest level since May 12. The U.K. currency bought 82.51
pence per euro from 82.57 pence yesterday, when it advanced to
81.81 pence, the strongest since November 2008.  
 The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-1
to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, according
to minutes of the June 10 decision released in London this week.
Andrew Sentance, a committee member, favored an increase to
0.75 percent, arguing that inflation was proving to be
“resilient” after the recession.  
 The U.K. inflation rate rose to a 17-month high of 3.7
percent in April and was at 3.4 percent in May, above the
government’s 3 percent upper limit.
