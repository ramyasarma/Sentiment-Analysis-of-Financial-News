             Australia , the largest shipper of
iron ore and coal, is more likely to alter than scrap a proposed
mining tax after the appointment of new Prime Minister  Julia Gillard , said Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 “The unions - who have a strong influence in this Labor
government - have supported the proposed resource super profits
tax and so too has the International Monetary Fund,” Credit
Suisse analyst  Paul McTaggart  said today in a report. “The IMF
has (behind the scenes) been calling for developing nations to
move to a RSPT type tax regime with higher taxes for mining.”  
 The ruling Labor party yesterday dumped  Kevin Rudd , the
architect of the tax, for Gillard, who opened the door to talks
on the proposed 40 percent tax that Morgan Stanley estimates
would have taken A$85 billion ($74 billion) from the mining
industry during the next decade. Treasurer  Wayne Swan  reaffirmed
the government’s commitment to a profits-based mining tax.  
 “The key message is that the Australian government is now
open to negotiation, not only consultation, on the resource
super profits tax so there appears to be room for a watering-
down of its impact,” McTaggart said.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Rio Tinto Group agreed yesterday to
stop advertising campaigns against the tax after Gillard ordered
the cessation of the government’s advertisements. That may be
“a sign that we can expect more progress on the resource super
profits tax issue in the coming weeks,” McTaggart said.
