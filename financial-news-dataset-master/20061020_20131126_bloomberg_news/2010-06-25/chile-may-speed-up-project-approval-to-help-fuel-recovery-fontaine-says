             Chile’s government will seek to
accelerate the approval of investment projects to strengthen the
economy’s recovery from February’s earthquake, Economy Minister
 Juan Andres Fontaine  said.  
 Ministers  will meet “soon” to study projects that face
delays, Fontaine said today in a telephone interview from San
Francisco, California. Projects requiring $31 billion in
investment are awaiting environmental approval, he said.  
 “We’re going to start with mining and energy, with a focus
on the most significant projects in terms of their impact on
Chile’s growth,” Fontaine said.  
 South America’s fifth-largest economy is rebounding from
last year’s slump and an 8.8-magnitude earthquake that smashed
ports, roads and factories across an area of the country
responsible for 17 percent of gross domestic product. The
economy grew 4.6 percent in April from a year ago and 8.2
percent from March when it shrank the most since 1996.  
 Fontaine, who chaired Chile’s electronic stock exchange
before becoming a minister, is in the U.S. to meet with Silicon
Valley companies, research institutions and representatives of
the New York and Nasdaq exchanges.  
 Chile plans to begin a pilot program to attract inventors
as part of a bid to become a South American innovation hub, he
said, adding that he wants at least one Chilean company to list
on the Nasdaq in the “mid-term.”
