             Estonian  consumer confidence 
advanced in June to the highest in 34 months on an improving
outlook for personal finances.  
 The confidence index rose to minus 3, the highest since
August 2007, from minus 5 in May, the Tallinn-based
Konjunktuuriinstituut research institute said on its  website  in
a statement dated June 22. The outlook for personal finances in
the next 12 months rose to minus 1 from minus 3, it said.  
 Consumer sentiment has climbed from a record low in March
2009 as the $17 billion  economy emerge d from a recession, helped
by rising demand in its Nordic export markets. The European
Commission last month recommended Estonia join the euro region
in January, making it the 17th member of the currency bloc.  
 Inflationary expectations rose “significantly” from last
month, reaching the “pre-crisis level of summer 2008,” the
institute said.  
 Thirty-six percent of surveyed households expect to save
money during the next 12 months, 51 percent to make ends meet
and 13 percent to live off old savings or are chronically
indebted, the office said, citing declining wages and record-
high unemployment.
