             David Cameron ’s governing
Conservatives named financier  David Rowland  of Rowland Capital
as the party’s treasurer from this fall, replacing  Michael Spencer  and  Stanley Fink .  
 Rowland, who has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to
the Conservatives, is a Guernsey-based property developer. In
the Sunday Times 2009 Rich List he was ranked a joint 65th with
his son Jonathan, with the pair worth 630 million pounds ($940
million).  
 In a statement to  the Times  newspaper last year Rowland
said he had returned to live in London to support the
Conservative Party.
