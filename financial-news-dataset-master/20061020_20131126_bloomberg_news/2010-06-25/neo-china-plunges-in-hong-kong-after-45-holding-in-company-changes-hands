             Neo-China Land Group (Holdings) Ltd .,
a Hong Kong-listed developer of Chinese real estate, plunged by
a record on its first day of trading in more than two years
after  Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd.  bought a controlling
stake.  
 The stock dropped 43 percent, the most since listing in
1993, to HK$2.84, the lowest in almost four years, at close in
Hong Kong trading, making it the market’s biggest decliner today.
The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 0.2 percent. Neo-China had
been halted since Jan. 22, 2008.  
 Novel Good Ltd., a  Shanghai Industrial  unit, paid HK$2.32 a
share on Jun. 24 for a 45 percent stake, and will offer to buy
all outstanding stock, convertible bonds and warrants, Neo-China
said in a filing yesterday.  
 The Shanghai Industrial purchase, of both new and existing
shares, provided capital to Neo-China and prompted the stock
exchange to allow the company to resume trading, Neo China said
Jan. 19. During the suspension, Hong Kong’s Independent
Commission Against Corruption searched the company’s premises
and arrested a former employee.
