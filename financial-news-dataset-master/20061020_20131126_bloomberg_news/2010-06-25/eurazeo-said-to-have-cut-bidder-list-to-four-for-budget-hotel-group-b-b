             Eurazeo SA , France’s largest
publicly traded private equity firm, cut the number of
bidders for B&B Hotels, the budget chain it bought five
years ago, three people with knowledge of the deal said.  
 Eurazeo, which is based in Paris, selected Carlyle
Group, the world’s second-largest private equity firm, as well
as London-based Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. and French companies
PAI Partners and LBO France for management presentations and
further due diligence after they submitted indicative bids, said
the people who declined to be identified because the process is
private. A sale may fetch about 450 million euros
($553 million), they said today.  
 Private equity firms are buying and selling assets again as
banks gradually resume lending after the credit crisis froze
dealmaking for two years. They led $57 billion in takeovers this
year, or 77 percent more than a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Eurazeo, which is also an investor in Europe’s largest
hotel group,  Accor SA , bought B&B from Duke Street Capital Ltd.
in 2005 for an undisclosed amount.  
 B&B is France’s third-biggest budget hotel group, operating
215 hotels in France, Germany and Italy. Revenue climbed 11
percent to 177.4 million euros in 2009, mainly because of new
openings.  
 Officials at PAI, Bridgepoint, Eurazeo and Carlyle declined
to comment. A spokeswoman for LBO France wasn’t immediately
available for comment.
