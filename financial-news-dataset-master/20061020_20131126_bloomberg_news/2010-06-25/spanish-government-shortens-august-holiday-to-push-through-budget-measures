             Spain’s government will shorten its
August holiday to push through labor and banking measures,
Deputy Prime Minister  Maria Teresa Fernandez  de la Vega said.  
 While Spain traditionally shuts down for the month, she
told reporters today in Madrid that the Cabinet would meet Aug.
20 and that the government would continue to function.  
 “The government is going to reduce its time off to the
minimum because the economic situation demands that the
government should be at full capacity,” Fernandez de la Vega
said after a weekly Cabinet meeting.  
 Legislation to loosen  labor -market rules will make its way
through parliament in July and August, while the government will
press ahead with an overhaul of savings banks and pensions and
an outline of next year’s budget during the holidays, she said.  
 Facing a 20 percent  unemployment  rate and a surge in the
 risk premium  on its bonds, the Socialist government is trying to
convince investors it can cut the budget deficit, bolster its
savings banks and sustain the recovery from an almost two-year
recession.
