             European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said the region’s leaders are determined to keep the
euro a “very strong” currency.  
 “I have no doubts of the absolute determination of
European Union leaders and European Union institutions to keep
the euro as a very strong and stable currency,” Barroso said in
an interview with Bloomberg Television in Toronto, where he is
attending a meeting of leaders from Group of 20 countries.  
 Against the U.S. dollar, the euro has fallen 19 percent
since its Nov. 25 high, trading yesterday at $1.2279 after
reaching a four-year low of $1.1877 on June 7.  
 The 16-nation currency’s “real effective exchange rate
has lost close to 10 percent” since its peak in October, the
European Commission, the EU executive, said yesterday in its
quarterly assessment of the euro-region economy.  
 The continent’s economic “fundamentals” are good, and
Europe’s debt and deficits are smaller than some of its “main
partners,” Barroso said, adding investors have been reassured
by an almost $1 trillion plan by the euro nations and the
International Monetary Fund to backstop the sovereign debt of
the region’s weakest members.  
 It’s “a very important message of confidence that is being
conveyed to markets as well,” Barroso said.  
 Barroso also said that China’s plan to provide more
currency flexibility was a “move in the right direction” that
increases confidence in the global economy.  
 Earlier yesterday, Barroso said that exit strategies from
fiscal stimulus programs should be gradual, differentiated and
“growth-friendly.”
