             U.S. stock-index futures pared
earlier losses, with the contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index expiring in September falling 0.1 percent to 1,070 at
11:42 a.m. in London, after earlier declining as much as 0.5
percent.  
 Research In Motion Ltd. declined 4.7 percent in Germany
after the maker of the BlackBerry smartphone reported sales that
trailed estimates. Oracle Corp., the world’s second-largest
software maker, advanced 3.7 percent as earnings topped
analysts’ forecasts.
