             Moscow has a “good chance” to
become an important regional financial center, VTB Group
Chairman Andrei Kostin said. “Moscow won’t replace London” as
the financial center, Kostin said in a Bloomberg TV interview in
London today. “The first target is to create a local regional
financial center,” he added.
