             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock-index futures
rose as Petroleo Brasileiro SA advanced on speculation it may
sell shares sooner than September.  
 Bovespa stock-index futures gained 0.2 percent to 64,950 at
8:50 a.m. New York time. Brazil’s Bovespa stock index fell the
most in almost three weeks yesterday after a report showed
unemployment unexpectedly rose in May, and on renewed concern
that Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  
 The real gained 0.4 percent to 1.7772 per dollar.
