             The Dutch politician leading talks
on forming a coalition government said future discussions should
exclude  Geert Wilders ’s anti-immigrant Freedom Party, which
surged to third place in this month’s inconclusive elections.  
 Uri Rosenthal  proposed  that party leaders should
explore a coalition involving 5 of the 10 groups in parliament.
They are the Liberal Party led by  Mark Rutte , which won most
seats, the Labor Party, which finished second in the June 9
vote, the Christian Democrats, and two smaller groups, Green
Left and D66.  
 “They’re prepared to assume responsibility to govern and
don’t rule out working with each other,” Rosenthal said at a
press conference in The Hague today. “All parties involved”
acknowledged that a coalition with the Freedom Party “wasn’t
possible,” he said.  
 Rosenthal, the Liberals’ leader in the upper house of
parliament, was assigned by  Queen Beatrix  to investigate
possible coalitions. It will take at least three parties to form
a government with a majority in the lower house. Coalition
negotiations in the Netherlands have taken an average of almost
three months since World War II.  
 Rosenthal recommended that the queen name two senior
politicians from the Liberals and Labor to continue discussions
on forming a government from what he called the “broad
center.”
