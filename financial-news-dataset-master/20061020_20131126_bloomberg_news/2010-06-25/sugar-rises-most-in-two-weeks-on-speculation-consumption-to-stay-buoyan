             Sugar futures jumped to a nine-week
high in New York on speculation that demand will remain buoyant.
Cocoa declined for the first time in a week, while coffee
gained.  
 Food companies and refiners are trying to rebuild sugar
stockpiles after drawing them down when credit was scarcer and
prices were higher earlier this year, according to a report by
Newedge Group. Prices rose to a 29-year high of 30.4 cents a
pound on Feb. 1.  
 “Overall, stocks are low,” said  Ricardo Scaff , a trader
at Rabobank International in London. “The tightness in this
market may last longer.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.2 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 16.39 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the commodity climbed to 16.48 cents, the highest level
for a most-active contract since April 22. The price gained 6.6
percent this week, the third increase in four weeks.  
 On the Liffe exchange in London, white-sugar futures for
October delivery advanced $16.40, or 3.5 percent, to $484.50 a
metric ton, the biggest gain since June 8.  
 The market may have “physical sugar shortages” in the
third quarter, London-based broker Czarnikow Group Ltd. said in
a review.  
 Sugar output in Thailand, the world’s second-largest
exporter, may plunge as much as 13 percent in the year that
begins on Nov. 1 as delayed rain and subsequent floods likely
have damaged crops, the  Office of the Cane and Sugar Board  said
yesterday.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery slipped $1 to $3,113 a
ton in New York, the first decline since June 17. Prices ended
the week 5.3 percent higher. In London, cocoa for July delivery
rose 13 pounds, or 0.5 percent, to 2,554 pounds ($3,840) a ton
on the Liffe.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery increased
0.15 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.689 a pound in New York, to cap
a 4.2 percent increase for the week. In London, robusta beans
for September delivery rose $42, or 2.5 percent, to $1,691 a
ton, the third day in a row of higher prices.
