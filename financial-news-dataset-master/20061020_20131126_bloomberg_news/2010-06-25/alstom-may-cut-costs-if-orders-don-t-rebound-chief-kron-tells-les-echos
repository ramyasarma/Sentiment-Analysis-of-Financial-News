             Alstom SA may cut costs if orders
don’t recover, Les Echos reported on its website, citing Chief
Executive Officer Patrick Kron.  
 “If we don’t see a rebound in orders, we may have to adapt
more,” the newspaper cited Kron as saying. “We’ll have more
visibility by the end of the year,” Kron added, according to
Les Echos.
