             U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index  retreated for
a fourth day, the longest losing streak in seven weeks, as BP
Plc tumbled to a 14-year low and mining shares fell.  
 BP tumbled 4.6 percent amid concern hurricanes may hamper
efforts to clean up its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and as
Nomura Inc. said the company may have to raise money to face
liabilities from the leak. Kazakhmys Plc and Antofagasta Plc
lost more than 3 percent.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100  retreated 53.76, or 1.1 percent, to
5,046.47 in London, extending the gauge’s biggest weekly retreat
in more than a month to 3.9 percent. The  FTSE All-Share Index 
fell 1 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  retreated 1.1 percent.  
 “Investors are still struggling to put a value on BP,”
said Anthony Grech, London-based head of research at IG Index.
“The threat of a tropical storm hitting the area is yet another
reason for the markets to give the shares a wide berth for
now.”  
 The  FTSE 100  has lost 13 percent from this year’s high on
April 15 amid concern about the fallout from Europe’s debt
crisis. The gauge today completed a so-called death cross, a
bearish signal that may foreshadow a further drop, according to
the head of technical analysis at Mint Equities Ltd.  
 Death Cross  
 This week’s selloff has pulled the index’s 50-day moving
average down to 5,314.16, below the 200-day moving average of
5,328.31. The last time the gauge formed a death cross pattern,
where the 50-day  average  drops below the 200-day average, was in
December 2007, as U.K. stocks began a 45 percent slump through
March 2009.  
 Stocks also fell as U.S. Commerce Department figures showed
the world’s largest economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in
the first quarter, less than previously calculated, reflecting a
smaller gain in consumer spending and a bigger trade gap.  
 BP  dropped 6.4 percent to 304.6 pence, the lowest level
since August 1996. The first tropical storm of the Atlantic
hurricane season has a 60 percent chance of forming this
weekend, with one computer model indicating it could head into
the Gulf of Mexico, where BP has a flotilla of vessels trying to
clean up its oil spill.  
 Government forecasters say the hurricane season that
started June 1 may be the worst since 2005. Storms will hamper
what President  Barack Obama  has called the biggest environmental
cleanup in U.S. history.  
 Separately, Nomura said BP should sell shares to counter
concerns that costs from the oil spill will make it unable to
pay creditors. The cost to protect BP bonds against default has
climbed even after it agreed to set aside funds over several
years to cover spill expenses.  
 $15 Billion Cash  
 While BP can access about $15 billion in cash, the Atlantic
hurricane season is unsettling for investors,  Alastair Syme , an
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in London, said in a note to
investors today.  
 Kazakhmys declined 3.9 percent to 1,067 pence. Antofagasta,
owner of copper mines in Chile, fell 3.3 percent to 827 pence
and Lonmin Plc lost 3.7 percent to 1,523 pence.  
 The following is a list of companies whose shares may have
unusual price changes in U.K. and or Irish markets. Stock
symbols are in parentheses.  
 Avis Europe Plc  (AVE LN) sank 6.25 pence, or 18 percent, to
28.5 after the company controlled by Belgian car dealer
D’Ieteren SA announced a rights offer to raise approximately 151
million pounds (226 million).  
 Connaught Plc  (CNT LN) plunged 105.2 pence, or 33 percent,
to 215 after the biggest U.K. public-housing maintenance company
said it expects revenue in this financial year to be impacted by
around 80 million pounds following the U.K.’s emergency budget.  
 Mitie Group Plc  (MTO LN), which provides security guards to
all courts in England and Wales, lost 8 pence, or 3.7 percent,
to 211.3.  
 Stagecoach Group Plc  (SGC LN) gained 3.9 pence, or 2.1
percent, to 194.3 after Deutsche Bank AG raised its
recommendation for the operator of the U.K.’s busiest commuter-
rail service to “buy” from “hold.”
