             Treasury 10-year note yields may
extend their drop should they end the week below 3.06 percent,
according to Citigroup Inc.  
 “A weekly close below there would argue for a quick move
of lower yields, which would suggest further short-term
disruptions in equities and risk appetite generally,” Citigroup
strategists including New York-based  Tom Fitzpatrick  wrote in a
note to clients published yesterday.  
 After the  yield  fell below 3.06 percent in November 2008
during the financial crisis, it tumbled further to reach 2.04
percent on Dec. 18, 2008, the record low. In June 2003, as the
U.S. economy struggled with deflation concern, the yield halted
its drop at 3.07 percent and increased to 4.25 percent by the
end of the year.  
 The 10-year note yield was little changed at 3.14 percent
at 10:07 a.m. in New York. It reached 3.06 percent yesterday,
the lowest level since May 25. The yield has dropped eight basis
points this week.  
 Citigroup expects the yield may rise as high as 3.78
percent, mimicking the June 2003 advance. Sharp moves have
typically occurred from March to June over the past seven years,
Fitzpatrick wrote.  
 “Seasonal patterns suggest that it is time for the fixed-
income markets to turn again and yields to start rising over the
medium term,” Fitzpatrick wrote.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
