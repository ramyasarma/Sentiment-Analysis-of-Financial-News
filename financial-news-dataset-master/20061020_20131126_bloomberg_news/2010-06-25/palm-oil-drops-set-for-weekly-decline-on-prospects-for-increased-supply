             Palm oil fell, posting a weekly decline,
on concern that a seasonal recovery in yields in the second half and
a record soybean crop will boost supplies.  
 The September-delivery contract declined 0.3 percent today, and
0.7 percent for the week, to 2,384 ringgit ($733) a metric ton on
the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange.  
 “We are moving gradually into higher production in Peninsular
Malaysia,” said  Roy Lim , a director at  Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. ,
the country’s third-largest listed plantation company. “We expect
yields to rise up till October or November,” Lim wrote in an e-mail
interview. Prices would have to drop to attract buyers, he said.  
 Increasing production may extend a decline in palm oil futures,
which have lost 10 percent this year amid a record global crop of
rival oilseeds. About 90 percent of palm oil, the cheapest edible
oil, is produced in Indonesia and Malaysia. Dry weather late last
year and early this year caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon
stressed palms, helping drive a 57 percent rally in prices in 2009.  
 Global oilseed harvests are rebounding on soybean production in
South America, particularly Argentina and Brazil, Rabobank
International said yesterday in a statement.  
 Soybeans May Drop  
 Soybeans may drop to $9 per bushel by September, and extend
declines to $8.75 by March 2011, it said. November-delivery soybeans
in Chicago gained for the first time in four days, rising 0.7 percent
to $9.1875 a bushel at 6:58 p.m. in Singapore.  
 Palm oil and oil crushed from soybeans are direct substitutes
for use in food and biofuels. Together the two oils represent more
than 60 percent of the world’s edible oils.  
 CME Group Inc.’s September-delivery palm oil contract, which is
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, dropped 0.4 percent to
$736.50 a ton. On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery
palm oil was little changed at 6,494 yuan ($956) a ton, while Dalian
soybean oil fell 0.3 percent to 7,560 yuan a ton.  
 The premium of soybean oil over palm oil in the spot market dropped
to about $20 a ton, attracting more buyers for the bean oil because
the premium is usually over $100 a ton, China National Grain and Oils
Information Center said today.
