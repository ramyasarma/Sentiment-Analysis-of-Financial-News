             BP Plc  bonds fell to the lowest on
record and the cost to protect against default on the company’s
debt reached the highest ever amid mounting expenses to clean up
the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 BP’s 3.875 percent notes due in 2015 declined 1.75 cent to
82.25 cents on the dollar as of 8:25 a.m. in New York, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. Credit-default swaps tied to the
London-based company rose 10.7 basis points to a record 591.7
basis points, according to CMA DataVision.  
 The oil company has spent $2.35 billion to cleanup oil
spewing into the Gulf, according to its website. The spill began
April 20 after an explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig
operated by BP.  
 “It’s unclear how much the damages for the oil spill will
be,” said  Juan Esteban Valencia , a credit strategist with
Societe Generale CIB in London. “People believe it’s going to
be massive, but there’s no clarity. There’s huge uncertainty and
the bill keeps rising.”  
 The first tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
which started June 1, has a 70 percent chance of forming this
weekend. If it heads into the Gulf it may disrupt the cleanup,
which involves 4,500 vessels and 37,000 people.  
 A collection of thunderstorms was intensifying in the
Caribbean off Honduras and Nicaragua, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said at 2 a.m. Miami time.  
 ‘Perceived Negatively’  
 “The storm is a significant factor, but in this case,
almost any news is bad news,” said  Guy Lebas , chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. “The $2.35 billion spill expense was perceived
negatively.”  
 BP slumped to a 14-year low in London Stock Exchange
trading falling as much as 24.5 pence (37 cents), or 7.5
percent, to 300.75 pence. The company has lost 54 percent of its
market value since the April 20 triggered the spill.  
 Swaps tied to BP were quoted at 590.1 basis points as of
11:37 a.m. in New York, CMA prices show. The company is a price-
reporting service of CME Group Inc.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.
