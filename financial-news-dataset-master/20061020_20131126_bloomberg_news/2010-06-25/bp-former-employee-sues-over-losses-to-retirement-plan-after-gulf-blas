             BP Plc  was sued by an ex-employee
over losses to the company’s retirement plan caused by the Gulf
of Mexico oil rig explosion and subsequent spill.  
 Ralph Whitley yesterday sued London-based BP, its  board ,
the Savings Plan Investment Oversight Committee of BP Corp.
North America and the administrator of the plan in federal court
in New York. He asked for unspecified damages.  
 Whitley seeks to represent a class of plan participants and
beneficiaries, from Jan. 1 to now, whose accounts held BP
American depositary  shares . BP stock has lost about half its
value since the April 20 blast. According to the complaint, the
shares were one of the retirement savings options in the plan.  
 “The plan suffered millions of dollars in losses in plan
benefits because substantial assets of the plan were imprudently
invested or allowed to be invested by defendants in BP ADSs
during the class period, in breach of defendants’ fiduciary
duties,” Whitley said in the complaint.  
 BP spokesman  Toby Odone  declined to comment.  
 Whitley claims the defendants mismanaged plan assets, acted
in their own interests rather than those of the plan
participants, and continued to offer the shares as an investment
alternative when BP’s negative financial and operating condition
was being concealed.  
 The case is Whitley v. BP Plc, 10-CV-4935, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
