             The bankruptcy judge put the  Texas
Rangers  baseball club and its secured lenders under greater
pressure to settle yesterday, signing an order compelling
mediation over the reorganization plan and how much the lenders
receive.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Lynn in Fort Worth,  Texas ,
told the contending parties to begin the mediation on July 16.
The confirmation hearing for approval of the team’s Chapter 11
plan, which had been on the calendar for July 9, was pushed back
to July 22.  
 Lynn prohibited both sides from conducting investigations
in preparation for the confirmation hearing until the mediation
is terminated by the mediator.  
 Lynn named U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Russell F. Nelms as the
mediator. Nelms is the other bankruptcy judge in Fort Worth.
Lynn directed the creditors’ committee to participate in the
mediation along with the team and the lenders.  
 Lynn said he is requiring the parties to talk settlement
because he “understands that additional time for mediation
could possibly lead to the proposal of a consensual plan in this
case.”  
 Lynn handed down an opinion on June 22 that put pressure on
both sides to settle. The opinion was adverse to the Rangers
because Lynn concluded that the lenders and the equity holders
have the right to vote.  
 The opinion went against the lenders in drawing a roadmap
for how the team could confirm a modified plan over the lenders’
objection.  
 The lenders are owed $525 million, although they are
entitled to collect only $75 million from the team.  
 The Rangers’ plan is to be financed by a sale of the team
in a $575 million transaction to a group including incumbent
team President Nolan Ryan, a former major league pitcher and
member of the Hall of Fame.  
 To read details of Lynn’s June 22 decision, click here for
the June 23 Bloomberg bankruptcy report.  
 The Rangers’ revised disclosure statement says that the
lenders ultimately would be paid a total of $256 million,
including the initial $75 million plus the surplus left over
from the sale price after creditors are paid. The surplus would
go to the lenders because they have a security interest in the
limited and general partners that own the team.  
 The Rangers moved from  Washington  to Texas in 1972. The
team defaulted on payments owing to the lenders in March 2009.
Michael Rochelle, a brother of reporter Bill Rochelle, is a
lawyer for an agent for the lenders.  
 The partnership that owns the team, Texas Rangers Baseball
Partners, said in its petition that the assets and debt are both
less than $500 million.  
 The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth).  
 Updates  
 Neenah Has Approval for $135 Million Exit Financing  
 Although Neenah Foundry Co. didn’t go ahead at yesterday’s
hearing to confirm the reorganization plan, the producer of
cast-iron manhole covers and sewer grates was authorized on June
23 to sign commitment agreements, pay fees and grant
indemnification to lenders providing $135 million in financing
to kick in when the plan becomes effective.  
 The confirmation hearing for approval of the plan was
pushed back to July 6, and the time for voting on the plan was
extended to July 2.  
 Bank of America NA will provide a $75 million revolving
credit once the plan becomes effective. Golden Tree Asset
Management LP and MacKay Shields LLC are to be the lenders on a
$60 million term loan.  
 Neenah’s plan was negotiated before the Chapter 11 filing
in February with holders of 55 percent of secured notes and all
the subordinated notes. For details on the plan, click here to
see the April 29 Bloomberg bankruptcy report. Neenah, based in
the Wisconsin town of the same name, reported a $150 million net
loss for the Sept. 30 fiscal year on sales of $333 million.  
 The case is In re Neenah Enterprises Inc., 10-10360, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  
 Circuit City, Creditors’ Committee Mediating on Plan Details  
   Circuit City Stores Inc . and the official creditors’
committee were directed by the bankruptcy judge to mediate their
disputes so there can be a liquidating Chapter 11 plan on which
both sides agree.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin R. Huennekens in Richmond,
Virginia, told the company and the committee to complete
mediation in 30 days and report to him at a July 22 status
conference.  
 Circuit City and the committee jointly filed a liquidating
plan last August for the former 721-store electronics retailer.
They were never able to agree on who would control the
liquidating trust to be created under the plan. At loggerheads,
the committee this month filed its own version of the plan and
liquidating trust documents.  
 Not liking the committee version, Circuit City sought
mediation, which Huennekens mandated at a hearing yesterday.  
 In addition to the dispute over the liquidating trust, the
plan couldn’t be confirmed in view of outstanding Canadian tax
claims.  
 All except about $5 million to $20 million in secured
claims already have been paid in full with proceeds from store
liquidations. Unsecured creditors with claims ranging from $1.8
billion to $2 billion were estimated to have a recovery ranging
between nothing and 13.5 percent, according to the explanatory
disclosure statement for the joint plan.  
 Circuit City filed under Chapter 11 in November 2008 in its
hometown of Richmond, listing assets of $3.4 billion and debt
totaling $2.3 billion as of Aug. 31, 2008. Papers originally
listed $898 million owing to the secured revolving credit
lenders. Unsecured trade suppliers were owed another $650
million at the outset, the company said in a court filing.  
 The case is In re Circuit City Stores Inc., 08-35653, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).  
 Zayat Stables, Fifth Third Settle on Reorganization Plan  
 Zayat Stables LLC  and the secured lender Fifth Third Bank
reached a settlement that should permit approval of the stables’
reorganization plan at the scheduled July 15 confirmation
hearing.  
 The settlement modifies the Cincinnati-based bank’s
treatment under the plan. Other creditors aren’t adversely
affected, Zayat say in court papers. Approval will be considered
at a hearing in bankruptcy court on June 30.  
 The settlement, if approved, ends all disputes between the
stables and the bank, including lawsuits where Zayat claimed
Fifth Third engaged in “predatory lending” practices.  
 In the revised plan, the bank’s loan will be fully paid by
the end of 2014. The current principal balance of $28.2 million
will be paid down by at least $3.23 million to $4 million a
year, with a balloon payment due at the end of 2014. Going
forward, interest will be three percentage points higher than
the London interbank borrowed rate.  
 The bank will also share in part of the proceeds from the
sale of horses, with payments applied against the annual
minimums. Accrued interest of $623,000 will be paid June 30.  
 Unsecured creditors are voting on the plan, which will pay
them in full over two years without interest. Ahmed Zayat is to
retain ownership. The bank was suing Zayat on a personal
guarantee.  
 The stables, based in Hackensack, New Jersey, filed under
Chapter 11 in February in  Newark ,  New Jersey . The stables have
more than 200 horses representing collateral for the bank.
Revenue in 2009 was $21 million.  
 The case is In re Zayat Stables LLC, 10-13130, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).  
 Neff Committee, U.S. Trustee Oppose Debtor Initiatives  
 With unsecured creditors slated for a 1 percent recovery
under the Chapter 11 plan, it’s no surprise that the official
creditors’ committee opposes initiatives by Neff Corp., a
closely held equipment-rental company that began a prepackaged
reorganization on May 16.  
 The committee is objecting to final approval for a $175
million financing package, saying less than $18 million
represents fresh cash. The remainder entails converting pre-
bankruptcy secured debt into an obligation of the company in
Chapter 11.  
 The committee is also opposing an executive bonus program.
The committee says that the bonuses improperly lock the
executives into pursuit of the plan negotiated before
bankruptcy. For details on the bonus proposal, click here for
the May 28 Bloomberg bankruptcy report.  
 The U.S. Trustee is opposing the proposed terms for hiring
financial advisers. The  Justice Department ’s watchdog in
bankruptcy says the professionals wouldn’t even have liability
for gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, they
aren’t required to exercise so-called fiduciary duties and may
subcontract work without court approval.  
 The committee takes issue with the terms of the $175
million loan because it provides for paying professional
expenses and giving new liens to first-lien lenders covering
existing debt where the collateral is worth less than the loan.  
 The committee says it’s even more improper to give so-
called adequate protection for second-lien debt when the junior
loan appears “to be wholly out of the money according to the
debtors’ valuation.”  
 Neff has a July 12 hearing for approval of a disclosure
statement explaining the Chapter 11 plan designed to reduce debt
by more than $400 million. The plan would give most of the new
equity to first-lien lenders owed $90 million on a term loan.
For details on the company’s finances and the plan, click here
for the May 17 Bloomberg bankruptcy report.  
 Miami-based Neff, with 63 branches in 14 states, listed
assets of $299 million and debt totaling $609 million.  
 The case is In re Neff Corp., 10-12610, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of  New York    Manhattan ).  
 Samara Completes Purchase of WorldSpace Satellites  
 When  WorldSpace Inc . first won court approval to sell the
two geostationary satellites to a company controlled by its
chief executive officer, Noah Samara, the buyer defaulted on the
$28 million contract.  
 The second time around, another Samara company completed
the acquisition under a $5.5 million contract, WorldSpace said
in a statement yesterday.  
 The sale to Samara came to fruition after WorldSpace was
unable to agree on a sale to Liberty Satellite Radio LLC, which
had been financing the Chapter 11 case.  
 The Chapter 11 petition filed in October 2008 listed assets
of $307 million and debt totaling $309 million. Debt includes
$36.1 million on senior secured notes and $53.1 million on
convertible debt. WorldSpace has two geostationary satellites
serving 170,000 paying customers in 10 countries outside of the
U.S.  
 The case is In re WorldSpace Inc., 08-12412, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  
 Midway’s $1 Million Settlement With Redstone Approved  
 Midway Games Inc. was given authorization by the bankruptcy
judge for a settlement where the creditors’ committee
compromised a lawsuit by agreeing to take $1 million for
dropping remaining claims against the company’s owner, Sumner Redstone, and companies he controls.  
 Midway Games confirmed its liquidating Chapter 11 plan on
May 21. It had been the owner and developer of “Mortal Kombat”
and other  video games . The settlement generates more cash for
distribution to creditors who were told before the compromise
that they could recover 16.5 percent. Unsecured creditors of
subsidiaries are in line for 25 percent.  
 The creditors’ committee was mostly unsuccessful in its
lawsuit against Redstone and his companies. Originally, they
argued that Redstone caused a “disastrous and ill-advised” $90
million transaction in February 2008 that saddled Midway with
$70 million in new debt it “had no ability to satisfy.”  
 The bankruptcy judge in late January dismissed most of the
claims.  
 Midway sold assets to generate $43 million in cash, leaving
no substantial secured claims unpaid. Most of the assets were
purchased in July 2009 by a subsidiary of New York-based  Time
Warner Inc . for $33 million plus accounts receivable.  
 Chicago-based Midway filed under Chapter 11 in February
2009, listing assets of $168 million and debt of $281 million.
Including foreign subsidiaries not in bankruptcy, the asset and
liability totals were $178 million and $337 million.  
 Midway’s debt originally included $150 million in
convertible notes, $29 million on a secured term loan and
revolving credit, $40 million on a secured loan facility and $20
million on a subordinated loan. Unsecured claims by suppliers
totaled $96 million, the company said in a court filing at the
outset.  
 The case is In re Midway Games Inc., 09-10465, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  
 Age Refining Consents to Having Trustee Appointed  
 Age Refining Inc. , a refiner of jet fuel and diesel
products, agreed to have a trustee appointed in Chapter 11 case.
Financing for the reorganization was extended until Sept. 30 or
the sale of the business, whichever comes first.  
 The unsecured creditors’ committee and the primary secured
lender, JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, sought a trustee to replace
management. The committee and the lender say they have “lost
faith in the ability of the debtor’s management.”  
 A fire at the refinery in early May shut down operations,
cut off revenue, and precluded an auction where the refinery
would have been sold.  
 The appointment of a trustee allows any creditor to file a
Chapter 11 plan. Age already had filed its own version of a
plan.  
 Age filed for reorganization in February in San Antonio,
where the refinery is located. The formal lists of assets and
debt show properties with a value of $134.9 million against
liabilities totaling $104.6 million. Debt includes $69.8 million
in secured claims.  
 At the outset of the Chapter 11 case, Age said debt
included $29.6 million owing on a construction loan to New York-
based JPMorgan. The bank is also agent for a $50 million
revolving credit that was undrawn at the outset of the
reorganization. Letters of credit totaling $26.6 million were
undrawn when the Chapter 11 petition was filed.  
 The case is In re Age Refining Inc., 10-50501, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Western District of Texas (San Antonio).  
 Twin River Racino’s Plan Confirmed by Rhode Island Judge  
 The bankruptcy judge ruled in favor of approving the
reorganization plan for UTGR Inc. at a June 23 confirmation
hearing in Providence, Rhode Island. The order formally
confirming the plan awaits the judge’s signature.  
 UTGR operates the  Twin River  racetrack-casino in Lincoln,
Rhode Island. Confirmation was made possible when the state
adopted legislation required to implement the reorganization.
The new law allows UTGR to halt dog racing and operate 24 hours
a day, seven days a week.  
 The plan carries out a settlement reached in January where
unsecured creditors should have a 65 percent recovery rather
than 5 percent. First-lien creditors owed $415 million are to
take home an estimated 89 percent by receiving all the new stock
plus a $300 million secured note. The plan was negotiated in
part before the Chapter 11 filing last June.  
 Second-lien creditors, owed $145 million, are to receive
half of sale proceeds between $475 million and $575 million if
the facility is sold within three years. They will receive 75
percent of sale proceeds above $575 million.  
 The formal lists of creditors showed debt of $568 million,
with $564 million secured. Revenue in 2008 was $410 million.
Most revenue comes from slot machines. The current owners
acquired the operation in 2005 for $470 million and spent $220
million on improvements.  
 Twin River competes with casinos in  Connecticut . It was
owned by a joint venture between Kerzner International Ltd.,
Starwood Capital Group LLC and Waterford Group LLC. The current
owners gave up control under a provision in the pre-bankruptcy
agreement.  
 The case is In re UTGR Inc. d/b/a Twin River, 09-12418,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Rhode Island (Providence).  
 National Envelope Has Buyer for Hamburg, New York, Plant  
 National Envelope Corp., the largest closely held envelope-
manufacturing company in the U.S., intends to sell a shuttered
plant in Hamburg, New York, for $1 million to Grimsview
Properties LLC.  
 The property, on almost six acres, has 88,000 square feet
of what NEC calls “operational space.” The plant ceased
operating one year ago.  
 A hearing to approve the sale has been set for July 13.  
 The company’s lawyer previously said there should be a
contract for the sale of the entire business within a few weeks.
The loan agreement, where General Electric Capital Corp. is
agent for the lenders, requires having a sale agreement by July
2 and approval of sale procedures by July 16.  
 NEC, based in Uniondale, New York, has 14 manufacturing
plants in 11 states, plus three warehouses. Sales in 2009 were
$676 million, resulting in a $44.2 million net loss. The
petition said assets and debt are both less than $500 million.
Liabilities include $74.3 million on a secured term loan, $70.6
million on a secured revolving credit, and $89 million owing on
unsecured debts to trade suppliers.  
 The case is In re NEC Holdings Corp., 10-11890, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

 Connector 2000 Association Inc. , the not-for-profit owner
of a 16-mile toll road in South Carolina, filed a petition for a
municipal reorganization under Chapter 9 yesterday in
Spartanburg, South Carolina.  
 As a public benefit corporation under South Carolina law,
Connector 2000 says it’s eligible for reorganization in Chapter
9 as a municipality. A court filing says toll revenue from the
outset trailed projections and isn’t sufficient to service about
$316 million in tax-exempt bonds.

   ClearPoint Business Resources Inc ., once a provider of
temporary staffing services, filed a Chapter 11 petition on June
23 in Delaware, owing $12.7 million to the secured lender
ComVest Capital LLC.  
 Court papers say the assets are $5.5 million while
consolidated debt is $24.5 million. Revenue in 2009 was $5.2
million. ComVest owns 57 percent of the outstanding common stock
as the result of exercising warrants.  
 ClearPoint, based in Chalfont, Pennsylvania, sold most of
the business in April to the former chief executive officer for
a $4.85 million note. Current revenue is about $30,000 a month
in royalties on client contracts and a subcontract fee of
$250,000 that ends in December.

makes loans to petroleum retailers, filed a Chapter 11 petition
on June 23 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, saying assets and debt

lender Autobahn Funding Co. The loan was declared in default
earlier this month.

petition on June 23 against Lexi Development Co., an investor in
loans secured by real estate.  
 The London-based bank sued Lexi in U.S. District Court in
March when a $20 million loan matured and wasn’t paid.

 Philadelphia Newspapers Confirmation Hearing Begins

plan and sale of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia
Daily News to secured lenders who won the auction in April with
a bid then said to be worth $139 million. Topics under
discussion include union contracts, pension plans and libel
suits. The hearing will continue today and may run into next

 The newspapers began their Chapter 11 reorganization in
February 2009 in their hometown after defaulting on a term loan
and revolving credit totaling $296.6 million and on $98.5
million in subordinated notes. The secured lenders lost the
major controversy in the case when the federal appeals court
ruled they were required to bid cash at auction rather than use
the secured debt as currency.  
 The case in bankruptcy court is In re Philadelphia
Newspapers LLC, 09-11204, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).

 Concrete Grinder Penhall Lowered to CCC- by S&P  
 Penhall International Corp. received its third downgrade in
13 months from  Standard & Poor’s  when the corporate peg slipped
another two clicks yesterday to CCC-.  
 S&P said there is an increased chance of violating a loan
covenant in the “near term.”  
 Earlier this month, Moody’s Investors Service said that
Penhall Holding Co., the holding company for Penhall
International, has “unsustainable” leverage and debt
maturities in the next two years. Moody’s predicted that non-
residential construction would decline 10 percent this year.  
 Penhall is the largest U.S. provider of concrete breaking
and grinding services. It operates in 18 states with more than
800 pieces of equipment, Moody’s said.  
 Downgrades  
 USG Downgraded to Caa1 on Lower Wallboard Volumes  
 The decline in housing prompted Moody’s Investors Service
to lower the corporate rating of  USG Corp . by one notch. The
corporate grade for one of the world’s largest manufacturers of
gypsum wallboard is now Caa1.  
 Moody’s said that capacity utilization below 50 percent for
the last year is not throwing off enough cash to cover interest
expense over the “intermediate term.” When cash on hand and
borrowing capacity are included, Moody’s said that USG should be
able to cover “cash shortfalls over the intermediate term.”  
 Chicago-based USG reported a $110 million net loss in the
first quarter on sales of $716 million. For 2009, there was a
$185 million operating loss and a $787 million net loss on sales
of $3.24 billion. Revenue was $5.2 billion in 2007 when there
was net income of $77 million.  
 USG closed yesterday at $13.88, down 54 cents in New York
Stock Exchange trading. The three-year closing high was $49.59
on July 6, 2007. The three-year low was $4.21 on March 9, 2009.  
 Symbion, Ambulatory Surgery Provider, Lowered to B3  
 Symbion Inc., the operator of 53 ambulatory surgery
centers, has a B3 corporate rating following yesterday’s one-
notch downgrade from Moody’s Investors Service.  
 Moody’s said the Nashville, Tennessee-based company “will
need to access the capital markets or restructure in order to
address upcoming cash obligations.”  
 In addition to the ambulatory surgery facilities, Symbion
has four hospitals. It also manages eight surgery centers and
one physicians’ network.  
 Symbion reported a $5.6 million net loss in the first
quarter on revenue of $85 million. In 2009, revenue of $347
million resulted in a $22 million net loss.  
 Symbion was acquired in 2007 by Crestview Partners LP.
