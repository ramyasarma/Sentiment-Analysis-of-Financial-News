             George Williamson Kenya Ltd., a
grower of the leaves, said profit for the year through March
surged almost seven-fold.  
 Net income increased to 876.1 million shillings compared
with 109.9 million shillings a year earlier, the company said in
an e-mailed statement distributed by the Nairobi Stock Exchange.  
 Revenue advanced to 2.72 billion shillings compared with
1.49 billion shillings, and the company proposed to pay a final
dividend of 6.25 shillings per share.  
 The group had a “remarkable year due to good weather
conditions and support from the local green-leaf farmers and
communities,” it said.
