             Reliance Power Ltd. ’s request for
$650 million in financing to build a coal-fired power plant in
India has been rejected by the U.S. Export-Import Bank’s board,
spokeswoman  Stephanie O’Keefe  said.  
 “We’re not doing the deal,” she said.  
 The request was turned down during the lender’s preliminary
consideration of projects that would generate high levels of
carbon emissions, and followed complaints from environmental
groups such as the Sierra Club that giving government-backed
funds would undercut the Obama administration’s pledge to limit
export financing on projects that might harm the environment.  
 Reliance Power of Mumbai was awarded the project to build a
power plant in  Sasan , central India, in July 2007, using coal
that’s mined nearby. The company expects to have 1,320 megawatts
of capacity at the plant by March 2012, Chief Executive Officer
Jayarama Chalasani said in December.  
 Environmental groups said the annual estimated amount of
emissions from the Sasan plant was more than double the level
from all projects funded by the U.S.-government-backed lender
last year.  
 “This is an important precedent,” said  Doug Norlen ,
policy director for Pacific Environment, a San Francisco-based
watchdog of government financing bodies such as Export-Import
Bank. “It’s the first time Ex-Im ever turned down a project
based on the climate implications.”
