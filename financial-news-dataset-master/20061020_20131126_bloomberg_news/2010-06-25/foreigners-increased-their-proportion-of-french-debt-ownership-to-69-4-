             The proportion of French government
bonds held by foreign owners rose to 69.4 percent at the end of
March from 67.9 percent at the end of 2009 as the growing
sovereign-debt crisis drove investors to the safest assets.  
 Foreign buyers held 64.9 percent of French bonds in the
first quarter of last year, Agence France Tresor, the country’s
debt agency, said on its Web site today.  
 “The data reflects the underlying trend of risk aversion
in the region,” said  David Keeble , head of fixed-income
strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “France, as a triple-A issuer, benefits from that
trend. It’s about preserving your capital rather than making
money at the moment.”  
 The yield on 10-year French  notes  rose four basis points to
3.10 percent at 10 a.m. in London. French bonds gave investors a
5.5 percent return this year, compared with a 6.7 percent gain
from German bunds, perceived as the region’s safest debt,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.  
 Bonds from Greece, whose fiscal difficulties triggered the
latest crisis in sovereign debt, have lost 19 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  
 Investors in Asia and the Middle East emerged as “strong
buyers” for French government debt, Philippe  Mills , chief
executive officer of Agence France Tresor, said on Feb. 25. The
proportion of foreign holdings of French securities was 60
percent before the financial crisis erupted in 2007, he said.
