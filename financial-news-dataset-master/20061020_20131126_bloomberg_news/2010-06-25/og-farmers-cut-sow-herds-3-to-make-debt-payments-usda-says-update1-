             The U.S. hog-breeding herd on June 1
shrank 3 percent from 12 months earlier, a sign that some
producers are repaying debt rather than expanding after a return
to profit in March ended more than two years of losses.  
 About 5.788 million  sows  were being held back for breeding
at the start of the month, down from 5.968 million a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a
quarterly report. Eleven analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
expected a 3.5 percent drop, on average. Breeding herds
increased 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, when supplies
were the smallest on record.  
 U.S. hog farms have slashed herds after losing about $6
billion from late 2007 until early this year, as corn prices
jumped and the recession and swine flu curbed pork demand, said
 Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the University of Missouri
in Columbia. Hog producers made about $39 per animal sold for
slaughter in May, the third straight month of profits, he said.  
 “Producers tend to make changes in response to money in
the bank, rather than money in the future,” Plain said. “I
don’t see any expansion, given the current conditions. Producers
are waiting until their bankers are a little happier.”  
 The total hog herd shrank by 3.6 percent on June 1 to 64.4
million animals, compared with 66.809 million a year earlier,
the USDA said. Analysts expected a 2.9 percent cut.  
 Hog Prices Rise  
 Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.675 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 83.925 cents a pound today on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Futures have rebounded 43 percent in the past year, as
supplies shrank and pork demand recovered. The USDA released its
report after markets closed in Chicago.  
 Wholesale pork  prices have rallied 64 percent since
reaching a six-year low last August, according to USDA data.
Corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed, has dropped 10
percent in the past year, cutting costs for farmers.  
 U.S. hog-farm debt has doubled since October 2007,  Mark Greenwood , a vice president at lender AgStar Financial Services
Inc. in Mankato, Minnesota, said this month.  
 The U.S. inventory of hogs to be sold for slaughter was
down 3.7 percent on June 1 from a year earlier at 58.612
million, the USDA said. Analysts expected a 2.9 percent drop.  
 Sows averaged 9.81 pigs per litter during the three months
ended May 31, up from 9.61 in the same period a year earlier and
the most for any quarter on record, the USDA said.
