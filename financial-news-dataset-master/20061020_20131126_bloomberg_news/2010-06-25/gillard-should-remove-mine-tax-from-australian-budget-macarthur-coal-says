             Australia’s Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  should remove the anticipated revenue from the proposed
mine tax from budget estimates to show good faith in talks with
mining companies, said  Macarthur Coal Ltd .  
 “It is not possible to negotiate in good faith with a big
hairy monster like that looking over your shoulder,”  Keith de Lacy , chairman of Brisbane-based Macarthur said in an emailed
statement. “In return the mining industry would be fair dinkum
in its desire to negotiate a fair return for the use of the non-
renewable resources that belonged to all Australians.”  
 Gillard today said she had met with Treasurer  Wayne Swan 
and Minister for Resources and Energy  Martin Ferguson  to discuss
strategy on negotiations with the mining industry about the
government’s proposed 40 percent tax on mine project profits.  
 Separately, Xstrata Plc said the company was “encouraged”
by the government’s willingness to enter into negotiations.  
 “We will participate in those negotiations in good faith
but believe that it is of the utmost importance that
negotiations are concluded as rapidly as possible to avoid
further damage to the industry’s growth prospects in
Australia,” Xstrata said in an emailed statement.  
 Xstrata this month halted spending on projects worth A$6.6
billion ($5.7 billion) because of the planned tax.
