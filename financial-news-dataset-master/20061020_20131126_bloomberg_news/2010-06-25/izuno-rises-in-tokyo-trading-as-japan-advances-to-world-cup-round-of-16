             Mizuno Corp. , which supplies sports
gear to some members of Japan’s national soccer team, said the
yellow boots worn at the World Cup by star player  Keisuke Honda 
are proving so popular that some stores are running out.  
 The Osaka-based company has sold 70,000 pairs of Ignitus
boots since their release last December, overtaking an initial
six-month target of 50,000, spokesman  Kazuhiro Kimura  said
today. The shoes were developed with the help of Honda, who
scored in last night’s 3-1 defeat of Denmark to send Japan
through to the second round of the World Cup in South Africa.  
 “Honda’s goal was impressive and it will definitely
contribute to our sales,” Kimura said.  
 Mizuno gained 0.3 percent to 404 yen at the 3 p.m. close on
the Tokyo stock exchange, after climbing as much as 1.7 percent.
The benchmark  Topix  index fell 1.4 percent to 867.30.  
 “Sporting-related shares including Mizuno will benefit
from a seasonal boom during the World Cup,” said  Seiichiro Iwamoto , a Tokyo-based fund manager at Mizuho Asset Management
Co. “But based on past trends, these shares may drop again.”  
 Japan meets Paraguay in its next match on June 29.
