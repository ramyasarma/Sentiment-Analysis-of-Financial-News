             Italy’s biggest union CGIL staged a
general strike today to protest budget cuts by Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi ’s government.  
 The country’s two other national labor confederations,
CISL and UIL, declined to join the CGIL in the strikes.
Demonstrations in the centers of Rome and Milan snarled traffic
and delayed services for subways and buses. CGIL’s
transportation division said in a statement the strike caused
the cancellation of 86 flights at Rome’s Fiumicino airport  
 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has defended as
“absolutely necessary” 24.9 billion euros ($30 billion) of
planned budget cuts over the next two years. The measures
include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries, 4.5
billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments, a
partial amnesty on illegal building and a three-year wage freeze
for civil servants.
