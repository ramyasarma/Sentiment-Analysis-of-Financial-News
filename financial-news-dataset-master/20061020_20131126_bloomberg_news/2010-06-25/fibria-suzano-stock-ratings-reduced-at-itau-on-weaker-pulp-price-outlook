             Fibria Celulose SA, the world’s
biggest pulp producer, was cut to “underperform” and Suzano
Papel e Celulose SA reduced to “market perform” at Itau
Unibanco Holding SA, which cited the outlook for pulp prices and
the stocks’ valuations.  
 Klabin SA is the most attractive investment in the pulp
industry, Itau analysts wrote in a research note.
