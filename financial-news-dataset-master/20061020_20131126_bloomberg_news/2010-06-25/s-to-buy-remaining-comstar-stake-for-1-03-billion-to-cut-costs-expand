             OAO Mobile TeleSystems , eastern
Europe’s largest mobile-phone company, agreed to buy the
remaining stake in Russian’s OAO Comstar United TeleSystems for
as much as $1.03 billion in cash and stock.  
 MTS, as the company is known, will offer Comstar investors
0.825 MTS shares for each share, the companies said today in a
joint statement. MTS will also start a tender offer for 9
percent of Comstar’s stock at a price of 220 rubles per share.  
 MTS, which currently owns about 62 percent of Comstar, is
seeking full control to cut costs and sell television and
broadband offerings to tap growing demand for Internet services
in eastern Europe. The boards of Moscow-based MTS and Comstar
both recommended the deal, the companies said today.  
 “The merger will enable the full integration of the
Comstar and MTS customer bases and the provision of bundled
service offerings across Russia, which we believe will further
enhance our combined competitive position,” said MTS Chief
Executive Officer  Mikhail Shamolin . The implied transaction
value could be as much as $1.03 billion, the companies said.  
 Comstar shares  climbed 0.4 percent to 206.74 rubles in
Moscow. MTS shares rose 2.8 percent to 243.41 rubles.  
 AFK Sistema, billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s holding
company which controls MTS, fell 4.1 percent to $23.07 pence at
3:40 p.m. in London trading.  
 MTS said it is on schedule to exceed the planned $200
million of cost cuts announced in October 2009 when it
purchased majority control of Comstar. MTS will generate “at
least” $400 million in cost savings, Shamolin said on a call
with investors.  
 As a result of the deal, Comstar will be folded into MTS
and cease to exist as a separate entity. The companies expect
to complete the merger transaction, which requires approval
from 75 percent of investors, in the second quarter of 2011.  
 Goldman Sachs International is acting as financial adviser
to MTS. JPMorgan Plc is acting for Comstar.
