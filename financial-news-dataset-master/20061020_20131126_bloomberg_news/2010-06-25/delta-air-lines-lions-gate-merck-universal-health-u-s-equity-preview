             Shares of the following companies
may have unusual moves in U.S. trading on June 28. Stock symbols
are in parentheses.  
 Delta Air Lines Inc.  (DAL US): The world’s biggest carrier
and other air transport companies, including FedEx Corp. (FDX
US), failed to persuade a federal judge to block regulations
that make it easier for workers to unionize. The rules are
scheduled to go into effect on July 1.  
 Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.  (LGF US): Investor Carl
Icahn said he won’t rule out supporting a combination of the
motion picture company and  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. , the Wall
Street Journal reported on its website. Icahn said he was
“skeptical” if any deal between the two studios would make
sense for Lions Gate shareholders.  
 Merck & Co.  (MRK US): The pharmaceutical company is
challenging a decision by a New York jury to award $8 million in
damages in a case related to its drug Fosamax, calling the award
“unjustified and excessive.”
