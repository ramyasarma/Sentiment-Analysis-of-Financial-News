             The Czech government plans to
submit a proposal that would curb subsidies to the producers of
solar energy by next year,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing an
internal document from the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  
 The new law would set a ceiling above which the production
of solar energy won’t be subsidized, the newspaper said.
