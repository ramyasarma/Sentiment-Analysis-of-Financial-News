             The Ontario Securities Commission,
Canada’s main stock market regulator, said  Magna International
Inc.  must provide more information to shareholders before a vote
to end founder  Frank Stronach’s  control of the carparts company
can proceed.  
 A three-member panel of the OSC said the “circular does
not provide sufficient disclosure to shareholders to permit them
to make an informed decision,” according to a statement.  
 The OSC sought approval from the panel led by  James Turner 
for a cease-trade order on Magna’s Class ‘B’ shares or a ban on
issuing new ‘A’ shares to prevent the company from converting
stock that gives Stronach control. The commission argued
shareholders weren’t given enough information to make an
informed decision on the plan.  
 “We welcome a vote,” commission lawyer James Angus told
the panel at a hearing in Toronto yesterday. “We want the
voters to be properly informed.”  
 The vote was schedule for June 28.  
 Under the plan approved by Magna’s board, the Stronach
Trust would receive $300 million in cash and 9 million Class A
shares for the Class B stock that now gives the family about 66
percent of voting rights at the Aurora, Ontario-based company.
The deal values Stronach’s payout at C$965 million ($927
million) based on yesterday’s closing price in Toronto.
