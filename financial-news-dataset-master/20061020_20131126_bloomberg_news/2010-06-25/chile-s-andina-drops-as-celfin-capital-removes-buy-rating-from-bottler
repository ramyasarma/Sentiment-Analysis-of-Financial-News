             Embotelladora Andina SA fell for the
first time in three days after Celfin Capital cut Latin
America’s third-largest Coca-Cola bottler to “hold” from
“buy.”  
 Andina lost 0.4 percent to 2,080 pesos at 9:41 a.m. New
York time in Santiago trading. The shares are up 23 percent this
year.
