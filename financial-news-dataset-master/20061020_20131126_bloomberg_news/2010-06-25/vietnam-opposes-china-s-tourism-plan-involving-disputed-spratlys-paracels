             Vietnam’s government opposes China’s
plan to develop Hainan island for tourism in the 2010-2020
period, which incorporates the Spratly and Paracel islands.  
 Vietnam reaffirmed its “indisputable sovereignty” over
the islands, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Nguyen
Phuong Nga said, according to a statement on the government’s
website.
