             Japan’s  bonds  rose for a third week
as Asian stocks declined and the government pledged to balance
its books within a decade, boosting demand for the nation’s debt.  
 Benchmark 10-year  yields  dropped to the lowest level since
2003 as government reports showed export growth slowed and
consumer prices fell for a 15th month, enhancing the purchasing
power of the fixed payments from debt. Bonds gained as Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan ’s administration also pledged to restrict
debt sales and overhaul the tax system.  
 “Optimism is fading about the global economic recovery,”
said  Katsutoshi Inadome , a strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s largest bank.
“Investors who’d thought yields would go up in June are playing
catch-up and buying before the second quarter ends.”  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 dropped six
basis points this week to 1.14 percent as of 5:05 p.m. in Tokyo
at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price rose 0.540 yen to 101.432 yen. The yield fell
to 1.125 percent yesterday, the least since Aug. 18, 2003.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.45
this week to 141.06 at the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. They rose to 141.18 today, the highest for a benchmark
contract since June 9.  
 Stock Losses  
 Japanese stocks  posted the biggest weekly loss in a month
as U.S. reports showed the recovery in the world’s largest
economy is slowing.  
 The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average slumped 2.6 percent over the
week, the biggest drop since the five days ended May 21. The yen
climbed to 89.23 per dollar yesterday, the strongest since May
21, damping the outlook for Japanese exporters.  
 The Nikkei 225 and 10-year yields had a correlation of 0.7
in the past month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
value of 1 would mean the two moved in lockstep.  
 “As the yen has risen gradually since early June and
stocks struggle to advance, bonds are unlikely to be sold
much,”  Tetsuya Miura , chief market analyst in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co., wrote in a research note today. “It’s hard to
see what will reverse the trend for bonds.”  
 Consumer prices  excluding fresh food slid 1.2 percent in
May from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said today.
Exports advanced 32.1 percent from a year earlier, less than
April’s 40.4 percent gain, the Finance Ministry said June 24.  
 Fiscal Plan  
 Bonds also gained this week as the government said in its
fiscal strategy released June 22 that annual spending will be
capped at 71 trillion yen ($791 billion) over the next three
years. The government will decide changes to the tax regime
“soon,” the prime minister said.  
 Bonds pared this week’s advance today on speculation yields
near a seven-year low deterred some investors from buying debt.  
 The 14-day relative strength index for 10-year  yields  fell
to 29.5 yesterday, below the 30 threshold that some traders see
as a sign a security is about to change direction.  
 Ten-year yields rose 1.5 basis points today.  
 “Yields are bound to go up somewhat as investors finish
buying at the end of the second quarter,” said  Osamu Koizumi ,
who helps manages about $7.6 billion as chief investment officer
at Yasuda Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “People are buying
bonds not because they want to, but because they don’t have an
alternative. There’s no reason to expect 10-year yields to go to
1.1 percent or 1 percent.”
