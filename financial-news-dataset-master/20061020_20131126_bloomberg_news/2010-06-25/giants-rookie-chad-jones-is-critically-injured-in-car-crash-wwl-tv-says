             New York Giants rookie safety Chad
Jones is hospitalized in critical condition after breaking his
leg in a single-car crash this morning in New Orleans,  WWL-TV
reported.   
 Jones’s arteries and nerves were exposed in the accident,
which occurred around 6 a.m. New Orleans time,  WWL said , citing
unnamed officials. Jones, who played college football at
Louisiana State University, was in surgery at 10:15 a.m., the
station said.  
 The Giants picked Jones in the third round of the National
Football League draft in April. He also was drafted by the
Houston Astros in the 13th round of Major League Baseball’s 2007
draft and again in the 50th round this year.  
 Jones, 21, played on LSU’s  Bowl Championship Series 
national title-winning football team during the 2007 season as a
freshman and on the Tigers’ National Collegiate Athletic
Association championship baseball team as a sophomore in 2009.  
 The Giants are gathering information on the accident and
declined to comment, team spokesman  Pat Hanlon  said in an e-
mail. Hanlon said he wasn’t immediately able to confirm details
of the report.
