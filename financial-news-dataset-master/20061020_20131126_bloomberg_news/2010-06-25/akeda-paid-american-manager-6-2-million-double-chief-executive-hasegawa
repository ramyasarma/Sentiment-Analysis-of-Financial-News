             Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.  paid its
American head of international sales double the chief executive
officer’s salary, highlighting the expenses Japanese drugmakers
incur to lure managers with overseas experience.  
 Executive Vice President  Alan MacKenzie , 57, earned 553
million yen ($6.2 million), including a base salary, bonuses and
stock options, in the year ended March 31,  Takeda  said today.
Hasegawa, 64, was paid 223 million yen, the Osaka, Japan-based
company said.  
 Takeda joins  Eisai Co.  in paying some expatriate executives
more than their Japanese counterparts as they seek to attract
people with overseas experience. Japanese pharmaceutical
companies are expanding overseas to reduce reliance on the
domestic market, where  sales  are eroded by government price cuts
that typically occur every two years on average.  
 “A generous base salary and bonus payment is the standard
practice to attract talent overseas,” said Teruo Seno, Japan
country manager of Korn/Ferry International, a Los Angeles-based
recruiting company, in a telephone interview. “Japanese
companies must pay more than what they typically would in Japan
to hire or keep foreign-recruited talent.”  
 MacKenzie joined Tap Pharmaceuticals, a former joint
venture between Takeda and Abbott Laboratories, in 1985. He took
on his current role as head of sales and marketing outside Japan
in April 2009.  
 Takeda gained  0.7 percent to 3,865 yen in Tokyo trading
today. The stock has gained 14 percent since MacKenzie was
promoted to his present position, lagging behind the 20 percent
gain for Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  
 Lonnel Coats, the 45-year-old head of  Eisai ’s U.S. unit,
earned 140 million yen last fiscal year, the Tokyo-based company
said in a filing on June 18. Chief Executive Officer Haruo Naito,
62, was paid 136 million yen.  
 MacKenzie is Takeda’s most highly paid  executive  and one of
three whose salary exceeded 100 million yen in the year ended
March 31. Makoto Yamaoka, a senior managing director, earned 105
million yen. Japanese companies are required to report
individual compensation exceeding 100 million yen annually.
