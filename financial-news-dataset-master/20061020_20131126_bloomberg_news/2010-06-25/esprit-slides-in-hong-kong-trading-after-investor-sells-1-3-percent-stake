             Esprit Holdings Ltd. , the biggest
clothing retailer listed in Hong Kong, fell the most in three
weeks on the city’s stock exchange after an investor sold more
than one percent of the company in early trading.  
 Esprit , which derives more than 85 percent of sales from
Europe,  slid  as much as 3.6 percent to HK$44, the biggest
intraday decline since June 7, before closing at HK$44.45 in
Hong Kong.  
 A single trade of 17 million  shares , equivalent to 1.3
percent of outstanding shares, was executed 5 seconds after the
market’s open at a price of HK$45.55, a 0.2 percent discount to
the stock’s closing price yesterday. The shares had been
fetching HK$46.50 in premarket trade.  
 “The stock has been battered over the last two months,”
said  Matt Marsden , a consumer sector equity researcher at
Samsung Securities (Asia) Ltd. in Hong Kong, citing concerns
about declines in the euro and the fragility of Europe’s economy.
“The bulls and the bears are fighting it out over Esprit at the
moment.”  
 Marsden said people were buying the shares based on the
belief that its expansion in China as well as new management
will refocus it away from Europe to become a “truly
international fashion brand.”  
 Trading volume in the shares was three times the daily
average today. Representatives of  Esprit  had not returned calls
at time of writing.  
 Today’s decline extended Esprit’s slide this year to 14
percent, compared with a 5.4 percent decline in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index.
