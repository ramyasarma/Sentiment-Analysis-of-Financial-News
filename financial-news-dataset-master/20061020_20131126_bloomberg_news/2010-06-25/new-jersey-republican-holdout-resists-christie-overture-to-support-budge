             One Republican in the  New Jersey 
Assembly said he remains opposed to Governor  Chris Christie ’s
$29.4 billion state budget, hours after meeting with
gubernatorial aides who sought to change his mind.  
 Assemblyman  Michael Patrick Carroll , 52, a Morristown
Republican, said he sat down with the aides and legislative
leaders for more than a half-hour in a “cordial” meeting at a
local delicatessen. He said Christie’s Chief of Staff  Richard Bagger , Chief Counsel  Jeff Chiesa  and Assembly Minority Leader
 Alex DeCroce , a Parsippany Republican, were there.  
 “We both know each others’ positions,” Carroll said in an
interview. He said a disproportionate amount of the $7.9 billion
in school aid under the governor’s spending plan goes to urban
districts. “There are just certain aspects of this budget that
in my mind are unacceptable,” Carroll said.  
 Republicans hold 33 of the 80 Assembly seats, leaving them
eight votes short of the 41 needed to pass the spending plan.
Under a deal brokered during budget talks, Democrats agreed to
provide eight votes to ensure passage.  
 Christie’s spokesman,  Michael Drewniak , declined to comment
on today’s meeting with Carroll.  
 Assemblywoman  Alison McHose , a Republican from Sparta, also
has said she’ll vote against the spending plan. She was replaced
on the budget panel yesterday before it passed the measure.  
 Amendment Sought  
 McHose is seeking an amendment to redirect $613 million in
funding for urban preschool programs to districts statewide. She
didn’t respond to a telephone message seeking comment.  
 Democrats disagree with some of Christie’s $10 billion in
spending cuts and left it to Republicans to spearhead the plan’s
passage for the fiscal year that starts July 1.  
 Carroll, whose district includes Christie’s hometown of
Mendham Township, said the discussion at today’s meeting focused
on why he should get back in line with his party. Carroll, who
entered the Assembly in 1996, has voted against all but one
budget since taking office.  
 “I suppose the governor is going to have to start
negotiating in a better manner that he has been,” Assembly
Majority Leader  Joseph Cryan , a Union Democrat, said in an
interview.  
 Cryan said Republicans haven’t approached his party to
solicit additional votes for the budget and they have no plans
of providing additional votes. Assembly Speaker  Sheila Oliver , a
Democrat from East Orange, didn’t immediately return a phone
call seeking comment.  
 Spending Plan  
 The governor’s spending plan includes an $820 million cut
to aid for public schools, $445 million less for funding to
towns and cities and skips a $3 billion pension payment.
Assembly Budget Committee Chairman  Louis Greenwald , a Democrat
from Cherry Hill, said the eight Democrats will “reluctantly”
vote for Christie’s budget and the dozens of new charges it
contains.  
 Christie, 47, the state’s first Republican governor since
1997, defeated Democrat  Jon Corzine  in November amid voter anger
over property-tax bills that climbed 72 percent to an average
$7,281 in 2009, from $4,239 in 1999, according to state  data .
Christie said he wouldn’t raise taxes in his budget, which
closes a record $10.7 billion revenue gap.
