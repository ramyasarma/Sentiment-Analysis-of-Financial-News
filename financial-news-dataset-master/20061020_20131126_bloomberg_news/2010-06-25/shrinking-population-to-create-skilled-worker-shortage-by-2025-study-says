             Germany faces a shortage of skilled
workers in 2025 as the population is shrinking, the  Federal
Labor Agency ’s  research institute  said.  
 Due to demographic reasons the size of the German workforce
will constantly decrease until 2025 while the number of employed
in the services industry may rise by more than 1.5 million, the
institute said in a study published yesterday.  
 By contrast, the number of employees in the manufacturing
industry may fall by almost 1 million over the next 15 years,
the  study  said.  
 German unemployment fell more than twice as much as
economists forecast in May as exports from Europe’s biggest
economy surged, bolstering the recovery. The number of people
out of work declined a seasonally adjusted 45,000 to 3.25
million, the lowest since December 2008, the Labor Agency said
June 1.
