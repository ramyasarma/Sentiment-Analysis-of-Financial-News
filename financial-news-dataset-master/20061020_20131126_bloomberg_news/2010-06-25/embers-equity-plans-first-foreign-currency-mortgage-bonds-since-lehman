             Members Equity Bank Pty Ltd., the
Australian lender known as ME Bank, may sell the country’s first
residential mortgage-backed bonds denominated in a foreign
currency since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed.  
 The lender plans to issue $282.9 million of securities in
the U.S. currency and A$695 million ($599 million) of Australian
dollar-denominated notes, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings
said in e-mailed statements today.  Paul Garvey , ME Bank’s
manager of financial markets, declined to comment.  
 “ME Bank has been a strong issuer of Australian RMBS
throughout the crisis,” Fitch analyst  Adam Daman  said in the
ratings company’s statement. The lender is offering scheduled
principal repayments, which will “give some investors a greater
degree of comfort in terms of the timing and size of
repayments,” Daman said.  
 Australia’s mortgage-bond market froze in 2008 as Lehman’s
collapse spurred investors to avoid all but the safest debt.
While A$16 billion of stimulus measures are helping thaw markets,
mortgage-bond sales during the crisis were limited to local-
currency deals, according to the  Reserve Bank of Australia .  
 Lawmakers agreed to buy mortgage bonds during the freeze to
help smaller providers of home loans that rely on securitization
for funding. The Australian Office of Financial Management
bought A$1.25 billion of securities sold by ME Bank under the
program, according to data on its  website .  
 ME Bank, owned by a group of superannuation funds, was
created in 1999 to offer low-cost home loans, according to its
 website .
