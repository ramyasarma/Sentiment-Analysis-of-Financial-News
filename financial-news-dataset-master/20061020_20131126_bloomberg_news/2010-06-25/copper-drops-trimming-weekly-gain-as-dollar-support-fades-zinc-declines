             Copper dropped in London, trimming a
weekly gain, as signs of a slowdown in the global economic
recovery offset expectations of a stronger yuan and a weaker
dollar. Zinc also declined.  
 Three-month delivery copper fell as much as 1.4 percent to
$6,600 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at
$6,645 at 3:42 p.m. in Singapore, trimming its gain this week to
3.3 percent. Zinc plunged as much as 2.1 percent to $1,835.50
and last traded at $1,849.  
 Purchases of  new homes  in the U.S., the second-largest
copper consumer, fell in May to the lowest level on record after
a tax credit expired. Sales of existing houses declined, while
economists had predicted a gain, data showed this week.  The
dollar  weakened as the Fed kept interest rates near zero to
support growth and as China signaled an end to the yuan’s fixed
rate to the greenback.  
 “We expect metals to resume a downturn as support from
dollar weakness and yuan strength fades,” Zhou Hualiang, an
analyst at Shenhua Futures Co., said from Shenzhen today.  
 Copper advanced by as much as 4.6 percent on June 21, the
most since May 18, after the People’s Bank of China signaled an
end to the yuan’s fixed rate to the dollar, making commodities
priced in other currencies less expensive for Chinese consumers.  
 ‘Resistant to Declines’  
 The metal, used in wires and pipes, is still almost 20
percent off an April peak on concerns that the global economic
recovery may slow, hurting demand.  
 Copper for September delivery in Shanghai slid as much as
1.1 percent to 52,930 yuan ($7,792) a ton and ended the day at
53,180 yuan, up 4.4 percent this week. Shanghai aluminum dropped
0.4 percent to 14,830 yuan and zinc fell 2.2 percent to 15,010
yuan.  
 “Copper will be more resistant to declines as China relies
on overseas supplies for the metal, whereas it mines and makes a
lot of aluminum and zinc itself,” Zhou said.  
 Aluminum in London added 0.2 percent to $1,968.25 a ton,
lead gained 0.3 percent to $1,825 a ton, nickel was 0.6 percent
higher at $19,518 a ton, while tin declined 0.3 percent to
$18,100 a ton.  
 Japan’s shipments of rolled-aluminum products climbed 20
percent in May, a sixth straight month of growth, as the
economic recovery boosted demand. Supplies to the domestic and
export markets increased to 165,638 tons from 138,503 tons a
year earlier, the Japan Aluminium Association said in a
statement today.
