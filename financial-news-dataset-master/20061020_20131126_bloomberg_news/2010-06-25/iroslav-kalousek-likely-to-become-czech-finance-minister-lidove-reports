             Miroslav Kalousek , the deputy
chairman of the Top09 party, will probably become finance
minister,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing unnamed officials from
the Civic Democratic Party, which is leading the coalition talks
to form a new government.  
 Top09 may have to cede some of the ministry’s powers if it
wants the post, the newspaper said. Kalousek has threatened to
stay away from the cabinet and run for the chairmanship of the
parliamentary budget committee if some finance ministry’s powers
are curbed, according to the report.
