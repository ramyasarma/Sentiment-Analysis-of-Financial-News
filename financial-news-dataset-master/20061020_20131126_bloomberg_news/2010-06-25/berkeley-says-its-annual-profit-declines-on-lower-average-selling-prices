             Berkeley Group Holdings Plc , the
U.K. homebuilder with the highest selling prices, said full-year
profit fell 7.5 percent, beating analyst estimates, after
selling less expensive properties.  
 Net income for the 12 months through April declined to 79.7
million pounds ($119 million,) or 58.7 pence a share, from 86.1
million pounds, or 65.6 pence, a year earlier, the Cobham,
England-based company said today in a statement. Revenue dropped
12 percent to 615.3 million pounds.  
 “The housing market in London and the South East has
stabilized, albeit at transaction levels lower than we had
become used to prior to the turbulent market of the previous two
years,” Berkeley Chairman  Tony Pidgley  said in the statement.  
 Berkeley has benefited from being solely focused in London
and the south-east of England, where a recovery in house prices
has been strongest. U.K. home prices rose 10.1 percent in April
from a year earlier, the Department for Communities and Local
Government said June 15.  
 The average estimate from a Bloomberg survey of five
analysts was for profit of about 75 million pounds. Berkeley
didn’t declare a dividend, saying it would use funds to buy land
instead.
