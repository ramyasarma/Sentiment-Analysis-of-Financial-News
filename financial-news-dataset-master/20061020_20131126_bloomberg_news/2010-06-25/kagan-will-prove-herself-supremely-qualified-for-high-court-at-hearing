             White House officials say they have
no doubt  Elena Kagan  will leave her audience impressed when she
testifies before a Senate committee next week on her nomination
to the  U.S. Supreme Court .  
 Kagan, President  Barack Obama ’s second Supreme Court
nominee, would become the fourth woman in its 221-year history,
and for the first time give the court three sitting female
members. She will make an opening statement after the 12
Democrats and seven Republicans on the  Senate Judiciary
Committee  have an opportunity to speak.  
 “I simply marvel at what she is going to bring to this
hearing,” said  Robert Bauer , the White House counsel. “I think
it will be evident very quickly to people as they listen to her
how supremely qualified she is for the court.”  
 Bauer, speaking on a conference call with reporters, later
said, “There hasn’t been a stronger nominee for the Supreme
Court in certainly many years.”  
 Republicans say they will focus on Kagan’s lack of judicial
experience and seek to portray her as a partisan activist with a
liberal agenda. They say Kagan, 50, can expect tough questions
about recently released  documents  from her years in President
 Bill Clinton ’s White House, where she worked on issues including
abortion, gun control and campaign finance.  
 Republicans led by Senator  Jeff Sessions  of Alabama also
have challenged Kagan’s opposition to military recruitment on
the Harvard Law School campus as a protest to the Pentagon’s ban
on openly gay troops.  
 ‘In the Mainstream’  
 White House adviser  David Axelrod  said Kagan will show she
is “very much in the mainstream of thought about what the role
of the court is.”  
 Axelrod said Kagan has been spending several hours a day
fielding questions in practice sessions, plus additional time
preparing on her own. She will have met one-on-one with 62
senators by the time the hearings start on June 28, Bauer said.  
 The first day of hearings will coincide with the release of
the Supreme Court’s final opinions of its nine-month term. In
one ruling, the court will decide whether the Constitution’s
Second Amendment, which protects gun rights, restricts state and
local weapons-control efforts as well as those at the federal
level.  
 Kagan would replace Justice  John Paul Stevens , who is
retiring.
