             Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. was
raised to “buy” from “hold” by Citigroup Inc. analysts led
by Venkatesh Balasubramaniam, who said investors should switch
to the company from Larsen & Toubro Ltd. in the near term given
the difference in valuations and the relative stock performance.  
 The analysts raised their share-price estimate for Bharat
Heavy to 2,770 rupees from 2,673 rupees.
