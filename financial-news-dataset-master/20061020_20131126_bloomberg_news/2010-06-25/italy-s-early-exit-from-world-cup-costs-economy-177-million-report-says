             Italy’s failure to get beyond the
opening stage of the soccer World Cup will cost the economy
about 140 million euros ($177 million) as supporters spend less
on drinks, meals and nights out, a report said.  
 Italian restaurants and bars could have had 67 million
euros in extra sales had the team advanced, said an e-mailed
report today the  Chamber of Commerce of Monza , northern Italy.
About 70 million euros might have been paid by public
institutions and private associations to rent and set up outdoor
screens in squares and parks, the report also said.  
 Italy’s soccer defeat “won’t hopefully damage the
economy,”  Marco Tronchetti Provera , chairman of tire producer
 Pirelli & C. SpA  told Turin-based newspaper La Stampa. “It’s
just a psychological damage” in the short term, he also said.  
 Confindustria , the country’s biggest employer’s body,
revised up yesterday its forecast on the $2.1 trillion Italian
economy, saying that gross domestic product will expand 1.2
percent this year and 1.6 percent next.  
 Italy, ranked  fifth in the world  by soccer’s governing body
FIFA, was knocked out yesterday by a 3-2 defeat to Slovakia.
Europe’s fourth-biggest economy expanded 0.4 percent in the
first quarter as rising exports more than offset a weak domestic
demand.
