             Mexico’s peso rose for the first
time in four days as a report showed unemployment fell more than
forecast, fueling speculation the economic recovery is
accelerating.  
 The currency gained 0.4 percent to 12.6891 per dollar at
9:10 a.m. New York time, from 12.7332 yesterday. It has dropped
1.1 percent this week. The peso has gained 3.2 percent this year
against the U.S. dollar, the second-best performer among the 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  
 Unemployment “was a good reading overall, and supports the
steady upward trend in economic activity in Mexico,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an emerging-markets economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in
New York.  
 Mexico’s unemployment rate was 5.13 percent in May, the
national statistics agency said yesterday. Economists had
forecast a rate of 5.21 percent, according to the median
estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The rate was 5.42
percent in April.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.22 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA.
