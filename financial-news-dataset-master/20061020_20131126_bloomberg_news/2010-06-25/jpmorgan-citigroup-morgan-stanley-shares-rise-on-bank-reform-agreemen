             Bank of America Corp.  and  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. , the two largest U.S. banks, drove a measure of
financial stocks to the biggest daily gain in a month after
Congress agreed to ease proposed curbs on trading and investing.  
 Bank of America and JPMorgan each  rose  more than 3 percent,
in line with a 3.1 percent advance in the  Standard & Poor’s
Diversified Financials Index , as the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  fell. It was the financial index’s largest one-day
increase since May 27.  
 “The market is sort of celebrating the fact that the
largest banks’ operations are largely left intact,” said  Nancy Bush , founder of NAB Research LLC in Annandale, New Jersey, who
covers JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co. Even so,
future expansion of the biggest banks may be limited, she said.  
 The so-called Volcker rule to ban banks from investing in
hedge funds and private equity was “watered down a bit,”
allowing lenders to invest as much as 3 percent of their
capital, Deutsche Bank analysts  Matt O’Connor  and  Michael Carrier  said in a note to clients.  
 A ban on derivative-trading by commercial banks proposed by
Senator  Blanche Lincoln  of Arkansas was amended to allow trades
on interest rates and foreign-exchange swaps, which made up
about 92 percent of their total notional trading volume in the
first quarter. Banks will have as many as two years to comply.  
 “What Senator Lincoln wanted to do didn’t come to pass and
that’s a major win for the big banks,” said  Gerard Cassidy , an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  
 20-Hour Session  
 Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, rose
2.7 percent to $15.42. JPMorgan, based in New York, advanced 3.7
percent to $39.44.  
 Lawmakers from the House and Senate worked through the
night in a 20-hour session to reach deals on a ban on
proprietary trading by banks and oversight of the derivatives
market. The legislation, which also seeks to protect consumers
from abusive lending practices, still needs to be approved by
the full House and Senate. Congressional leaders aim to hold
votes next week and send it for Obama’s signature by July 4.  
 Obama today praised lawmakers for agreeing on what he
called the “toughest” consumer reforms in history.  
 The bill is “not as bad as it looks,” FBR Capital Markets
analyst  Paul Miller  wrote in a report. “The conference
committee avoided adopting the worst-case scenario.”  
 For example, congressional negotiators removed language
that would have required banks to act as a fiduciary when
selling derivatives to states, municipalities and pension funds,
Miller said. Instead, a code of conduct was adopted.
