             The rand slumped against the dollar
for a fourth day, posting its first weekly decline in three, on
concern that workers at South Africa’s state power utility may
strike, hurting industrial output across the country.  
 The rand depreciated as much as 1.5 percent to 7.6910 per
dollar and traded down 1 percent at 7.6513 by 4:41 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.5772. It has lost 2
percent so far this week.  
 A mediator gave workers at Eskom Holdings Ltd., which
supplies about 95 percent of South Africa’s electricity, a
certificate to strike after the two sides failed to reach
agreement on wage increases, according to the National Union of
Mineworkers. Eskom says the document from the mediator
recommends arbitration, and doesn’t grant walkout approval.  
 The rand’s slide “is likely to be a function of
yesterday’s larger-than-expected current-account deficit reading
and the growing possibility that Eskom workers will go on
strike,”  Michael Keenan , a currency strategist at  Standard Bank
Group Ltd.  in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note. “The threat
of further strikes has put rand bulls on the back foot.”  
 South Africa’s  current-account deficit  widened to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter, raising
the need for foreign capital to fund the gap, the central bank
said yesterday. The NUM, representing 16,000 of Eskom’s almost
40,000 workers, said today it will give Eskom until June 29 to
improve its offer.  
 The union has lowered its demand to a 9 percent wage
increase from 15 percent. The company is offering a maximum 8
percent.  
 ‘Decent Pay’  
 “If they want settlement, for the sake of the country they
must come to the table with 9 percent,” Paris Mashego, an NUM
negotiator, said in an interview on his mobile-phone today.
“Unfortunately we are dealing with an arrogant employer.”  
 Labor groups including the National Union of Mineworkers,
the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and
Solidarity said workers will strike if necessary to get “decent
pay,” according to a statement handed to reporters in
Johannesburg. The three unions said they will “follow all the
due processes required by law,” the statement said.  
 Government bonds fell, with the benchmark 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 losing 51 cents to 122.56 rand. The
yield on the bond rose 11 basis points to 8.09 percent.  
 The rand weakened versus all the 16 most-actively traded
currencies monitored by Bloomberg except the Korean won. The
currency slid 0.5 percent against the euro to 9.4058.  
 Investors reduced bets the central bank will lower its 6.5
percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next meets on July 22,
forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month contracts 
for cash in three months rose 1 basis point to 6.43 percent. The
rate reached a 6 1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.
