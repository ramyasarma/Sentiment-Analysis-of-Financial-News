             Romania’s Constitutional Court ruled
some of the government’s austerity measures are illegal,
Mediafax reported, citing “people close to the matter.”  
 The newswire said that some provisions of the legislation
aimed at cutting spending to meet the terms of the Balkan
nation’s bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund
contradicted local law, while others “are open to
interpretation.”  
 The court is expected to release its ruling today.
