             The sweeping overhaul of financial-
industry regulation approved by U.S. lawmakers will lead other
nations to take similar action,  House Financial Services
Committee  Chairman  Barney Frank  said today.  
 “You’re going to see American leadership lead to more
regulation worldwide,” Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who
led congressional talks on the U.S. legislation, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television.  
 House and Senate negotiators reached agreement early today
on the biggest rewrite of Wall Street governance since the
1930s,  hours before President  Barack Obama  traveled to Canada
for a three-day meeting of leaders from the Group of 20 nations.  
 Obama said he will argue for tougher regulation of the
derivatives market, stronger capital requirements for banks and
stringent safeguards against market manipulation.  
 Frank said the U.S. legislation goes further to regulate
Wall Street than he thought was politically possible just a few
months ago.  
 “We have a tougher bill than I was hoping to get,” he
said in the BTV interview. “We’ve done a great deal.”  
 The House and Senate will pass the legislation, he said.

                          June 25 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative Barney Frank talks with Bloomberg's Peter Cook about the agreement reached today by members of a House and Senate conference committee on the most sweeping overhaul of U.S. financial regulation since the Great Depression.
     The legislation shepherded by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd and Frank places limits on potentially risky activities such as proprietary trading or over-the-counter derivatives and gives regulators new powers to seize and wind down large, complex institutions if needed.
