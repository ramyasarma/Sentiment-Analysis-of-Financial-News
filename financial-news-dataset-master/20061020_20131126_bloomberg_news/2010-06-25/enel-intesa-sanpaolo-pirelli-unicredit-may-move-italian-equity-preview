             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
rose 17.22, or 0.1 percent, to 19,959.61 at 1:32 p.m. in Milan,
trimming this week’s drop to 3.8 percent.  
 The following stocks are among the most active on the
Italian market today.  
 Enel SpA  (ENEL IM) fell 1.8 percent to 3.59 euros. Italy’s
biggest utility is seeking bids for a stake of as much as 40
percent in its Green Power unit from investors who have
expressed an interest in the company, Il Sole 24 Ore reported.  
 Fondiaria-Sai SpA  (FSA IM) gained 2 percent to 8.07 euros.
Chief Executive Officer  Fausto Marchionni  said the Italian
insurer isn’t for sale, Il Mondo reported, citing an interview.
The company plans to sell property that would give it a gain of
at least 150 million euros ($185 million), the CEO said,
according to the weekly magazine. Fondiaria will only sell its
Nuova Liguria unit if it gets “satisfactory” offers, he said.  
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM) added 2.2 percent to 2.30
euros. Chief Executive Officer  Corrado Passera  said yesterday he
agrees with stress tests on banks as long as the criteria used
are similar for all institutions.
