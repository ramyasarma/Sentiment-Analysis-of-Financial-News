             The editor of a  Rwandan  newspaper
suspended by the government was shot dead yesterday outside his
home in Kigali, the capital, his colleague said.  
 “He was under surveillance and he wanted to flee the
country,” Jean Bosco Gasasira, the former editor of the
 Umuvugizi  newspaper, said today by phone from Kampala, the
capital of Uganda. Rwandan police spokesman Eric Kayiranga did
not answer calls to his mobile phone seeking comment.  
 Rugambage was investigating allegations that the government
was behind the June 19 shooting of a former Rwandan army
general, Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, who was living in exile in
Johannesburg, Gasasira said. The Rwandan government has denied
involvement in the attempted murder of the general.  
 Attacks, threats and harassment of opposition groups have
been increasing before presidential elections scheduled for
August, according to groups such as New York-based  Human Rights
Watch .  
 President  Paul Kagame ’s government banned Umuvugizi from
publishing for six months in April. Gasasira said he continues
to publish on the internet from exile.
