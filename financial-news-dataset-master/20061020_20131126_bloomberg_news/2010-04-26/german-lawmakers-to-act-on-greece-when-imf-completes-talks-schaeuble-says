             German lawmakers will act on aid to
Greece after the International Monetary Fund completes talks on
terms of the emergency assistance, German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said.  
 He told reporters today in Berlin he was “optimistic”
that the German parliament would approve the aid.  
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said yesterday
talks over the financial lifeline are accelerating and will be
completed “in time” to meet the nation’s needs.  
 Greek bonds tumbled today on concern Germany, Europe’s
biggest economy, would fail to act swiftly in providing its
share of a 45 billion-euro ($60 billion) European Union-IMF
package. The yield on two-year Greek debt jumped 300 basis
points to 13.96 percent, after soaring the most on record to
14.66 percent.  
 Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou was
negotiating terms of the aid during a meeting of counterparts
from the world’s biggest nations in Washington. With Greece
facing 8.5 billion euros of bonds maturing May 19, finance
ministers yesterday sought a swift resolution of the talks amid
concern any delay may trigger a further sell-off and spread to
other markets.
