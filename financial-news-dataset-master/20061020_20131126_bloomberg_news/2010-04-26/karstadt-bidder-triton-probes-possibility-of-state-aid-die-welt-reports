             Triton, the only bidder for German 
retailer Arcandor AG’s Karstadt department-store chain, has 
made enquiries about the possibility of receiving state 
support, Die Welt reported in its Welt Kompakt edition, without
saying where it obtained the information.  
 The private equity firm’s interest centers around securing 
new bank loans, according to the newspaper. An unidentified 
Triton spokesman declined to comment to Die Welt.
