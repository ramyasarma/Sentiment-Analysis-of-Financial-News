             The U.S. seeks deeper military ties
with China and is hopeful of a resolution with Japan on the
future of a military base in Okinawa, the assistant secretary of
state for East Asia, Kurt Campbell, said today in Hong Kong.  
 “It is the desire and opinion of the U.S. that military-
to-military contacts need to be resumed and should be
regularized,” Campbell said in a press conference. “There is a
start-stop quality in the past, and we seek a more steady
momentum. This is an essential missing element in high-level
dialogue between China and the U.S.”  
 The U.S. envoy arrived in the city today from Washington
and will travel to Tokyo tomorrow for talks with the Japanese
government, the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong said. His visit will
come on the heels of demonstrations yesterday by more than
90,000 Okinawans against keeping an American military base on
the island.  
 “We believe that taking steps on Okinawa to ease the
number of military facilities and to solve issues such as noise
and pollution are critical,” Campbell said.  
 Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said he will work to
“ease the burden” of the people of Okinawa after the protests
yesterday.
