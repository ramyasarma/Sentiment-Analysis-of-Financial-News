             Nigeria named Andrew Obaje to head
the country’s oil-industry regulator, replacing Billy Agha.  
 Nigeria’s oil ministry said Agha will become executive
director in charge of engineering and technical services at
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., the state-owned oil company.
Before his new assignment, Obaje was Agha’s deputy, the
statement said.  
 The change comes after Nigerian acting president Goodluck
Jonathan appointed Shehu Ladan as the group managing director of
the NNPC to replace Mohammed Barkindo who was sacked on April 6.
Jonathan appointed Diezani Allison-Madueke the same day as the
first woman to serve Nigeria as petroleum minister. Allison-
Madueke, a former executive at Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s local
unit, will be in charge of pushing through an oil bill that has
been criticized by international companies.  
 The ministry also announced the creation of a new unit
known as the International Trading Co., or ITCO, according to
the statement. It will be headed by Ayo Balogun, formerly head
of the National Petroleum Investment Services, it added.  
 Under a proposed oil industry law still being debated in
parliament, Nigeria is seeking to re-position the state-owned
company to make it operate as a profitable venture.  
 The west African country vies with Angola to be the
continent’s top oil producer and is the fifth-largest supplier
of U.S. crude.
