             California is planning to sell $2
billion of bonds next week to refinance debt that raised money
to purchase electricity for cash-strapped utilities during the
state’s power crisis in 2001 and 2002.  
 The California Department of Water Resources is scheduled
to sell the securities on May 5, according to California
Treasurer Bill Lockyer’s office. Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for
Lockyer, said the securities will be offered first to small
investors, with shorter maturities intended to capture the
interest of that market.  
 The water resources department sold bonds to finance the
purchase of electricity for investor-owned utilities when
wholesale prices soared because of shortages. Dresslar said the
refinancing will cut the cost of servicing those bonds, which
are backed by revenue from customers’ bills.  
 “It would save investor-owned utility ratepayers’ money,”
Dresslar said.
