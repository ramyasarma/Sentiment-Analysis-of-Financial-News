             Ships leaving Argentina for the
Falkland Islands must seek permission from the Argentine navy at
least seven days before departure, while ships headed to the
mainland must request it before leaving the islands, according
to today’s official gazette.  
 Argentina announced Feb. 16 that it would impose
restrictions on travel to the Falklands, known in Argentina as
Las Malvinas, shortly before the start of exploration by U.K.
oil company Desire Petroleum Plc in waters near the South
Atlantic archipelago.  
 Argentina claims sovereignty over the islands that the U.K.
went to war to defend in 1982.
