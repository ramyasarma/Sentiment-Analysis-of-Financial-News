             Deutsche Bank AG, Germany’s biggest
bank, may say profit climbed in the first quarter on debt and
equity trading and a rebound in asset and wealth management.  
 Net income probably rose to 1.33 billion euros ($1.77 
billion) from 1.19 billion euros in the year-earlier period, 
according to the average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by 
Bloomberg News.  
 Revenue from equity sales and trading was projected at 866
million euros, while analysts are forecasting fixed-income sales
and trading revenue of 3.03 billion. That would come after Bank
of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. reported record debt trading figures in the first quarter.  
 “Deutsche Bank should be well placed to report strong
fixed-income sales and trading numbers,” Jonathan Tyce and
Kapilan Pillai of FBR Capital Markets wrote in an April 23
report. The bank’s “private clients and asset management
business segments will be solid,” said the London-based
analysts, who have a “market perform” rating on the stock.  
 Deutsche Bank is scheduled to publish earnings tomorrow
before the stock market opens. Following is a table of the
average estimates and year-earlier and fourth-quarter results as
well as the number of analysts surveyed. The subsequent tables
show estimates by division. The figures are in millions of
euros.
