             Continental AG expects its planned
high-yield bond to be rated “B+” by Standard & Poor’s in the
coming days, Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified people
within the company.  
 That rating would be two steps above the “B-” rating the
agency awarded a previously planned bond, which the auto-parts
maker scrapped in February, Handelsblatt said. Continental aims
to refinance as much as 2 billion euros ($2.67 billion) with the
new bond, according to the report.
