             Compagnie Industriali Riunite’s
health-services unit KOS SpA, which plans to sell stock in an
initial public offering, reported a first-quarter net loss after
incurring costs related to the IPO.  
 KOS lost 392,000 euros ($522,300), compared with a profit
of 87,000 euros a year earlier, according to a statement
distributed by the Italian exchange today. Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 36 percent to
10.2 million euros, excluding 1.4 million euros of costs for the
IPO and 600,000 euros spent on acquisitions.  
 KOS, which manages more than 5,000 beds in nursing homes
and rehabilitation centers, plans to sell stock to fund growth
by buying and building more care facilities. Sales rose 14
percent to 76.1 million euros in the first quarter.  
 The company on March 31 said it filed requests with the
stock exchange and market regulator Consob to hold an IPO in
Italy.
