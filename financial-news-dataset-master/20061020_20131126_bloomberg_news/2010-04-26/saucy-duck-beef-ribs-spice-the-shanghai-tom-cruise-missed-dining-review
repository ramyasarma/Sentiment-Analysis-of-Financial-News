             So you’re coming to Shanghai for
the  World Expo , and all you’ve seen of the city is the part in
“Mission Impossible 3” where  Tom Cruise  leaps off the Bank of
China Tower. Care to know more? Let your stomach be your guide.  
 Shanghai is home to 20 million people and offers a range
of dining options, from saucy duck served in a raucous hall to
sea bass eaten a hundred floors up.  
 Typical of food in coastal cities, Shanghai cuisine is
heavy on seafood, and uses plenty of alcohol and sugar as
seasoning. Here are some choices, all within a 15-minute drive
or a 20-minute subway ride from the World Expo venue, even 
Cruise might enjoy:  
 Noble House, with several branches in the city,
specializes in seafood. I and my guest  Bob Dodds , a former
banker and wine enthusiast, dined at the outlet in the Babaiban
neighborhood of Pudong District, inside a replica of an old
Shanghai dwelling decorated with Chinese ink-paintings hung on
the wall and meter-tall blue-and-white ceramic vases on tables.  
 The restaurant pays homage to fine dining during the
city’s heyday in the 1930s, just before the Japanese invasion
of China.  
 All seven dishes we ordered off  Noble House’s  a la carte
menu were delicious. If we had to pick a favorite, it would be
the so-called Superior Baked Cod Fish. The fish, served atop a
flaky pastry crust, was brushed with a concoction of light soy
and oyster sauce that was the perfect complement.  
 Our Xiaolongbao (which literally means Buns in Little
Baskets), a dish of soup-filled dumplings that best represents
the Yangtze Delta cuisine, was authentic and enriched with
generous portions of crab meat inside their soft pastry skins.  
 Peppered Beef  
 The bottle of  Great Wall  1994 Cabernet Sauvignon we
ordered nicely complemented our savory black-pepper beef ribs.  
 A more common-man dining option is  Laofandian , located
near Yuyuan Gardens, a four-century-old Chinese-style garden
and a 10-minute walk from the historic riverside promenade
known as  the Bund . We were seated in a large banquet hall
adjacent to a wedding party and several drunken reunions. It’s
loud, brash and crowded -- the perfect embodiment of Shanghai.  
 In the face of the rock-concert-like noise, I yelled our
orders of Laofandian’s specialties like Steamed Duck with Eight
Kinds of Specialties and the sweet-and-sour croaker.  
 Stuffed Duck  
 The food came slathered in thick, sweet brown sauce.
Enough steamed duck arrived to feed a small village; the fowl
was served Thanksgiving style, except it’s stuffed with
glutinous rice mixed with savory ingredients like mushrooms and
chestnuts. The dish was heavy, tasty and kept me amused as I
tried to identify the eight ingredients in the stuffing
outlined in the dish’s name. I found only six.  
 The croaker, which had an overpoweringly fishy smell that
no sauce could mask, was a letdown; a better bet was the fried
shrimp with soy sauce. I tried to order the Dongpo Pork, a
classic dish comprising a Rubik’s Cube-sized block of belly
meat in a sweet sauce, and gave up after I was told it would
take an hour to cook. My ears couldn’t survive the noise that
long.  
 For lighter cuisine, Shanghai also has a nice selection of
dim sum eateries. Crystal Jade, originally from Hong Kong, is
arguably the best. Its menu is full of tasty Cantonese
standards such as har gao and siu mai.  
 Villas and Lakes  
 Shanghai’s  Crystal Jade  restaurant overlooks Century Park,
a 140-hectare area with villas and lakes amid oriental and
British-styled gardens, about 20 minutes by car from downtown
Shanghai. There’s also an outlet in the fashionable Xintiandi
area, where restaurants and bars are housed in refurbished red-
brick Shikumen buildings from the early 1900s.  
 Expect an eclectic selection at Xintiandi. Paulaner
Brauhaus brews its own beer and serves German cuisine ranging
from sausages to pork knuckles. Tasty curries can be had at
Simply Thai or sit down to the light flavors of Chinese
standards at Zen. In the afternoon, sit outside of KABB and
people watch with a do-it-yourself Bloody Mary.  
 For the best view in town, try the Park Hyatt’s  100
Century Avenue  restaurant atop the city’s tallest building
overlooking the Lujiazui financial district. I ordered a
cheeseburger which was a bit dry and my companion had sea bass.  
 Neither was as good as the view. As we looked down from
the  Shanghai World Financial Center  on the glistening sprawl of
glass and metal, the city’s future seemed stretched before us.  
 Riverside Dining  
 For a glimpse of the past, dine on the Bund where century-
old buildings that once housed  HBSC Holdings Plc  attest to the
city’s history as a finance hub. The Whampoa Club, located at
No. 3 on the Bund, offers the view and prices to match.  
 We ventured northward along the river to the Chinatown
Club. The former Buddhist temple turned burlesque club is
centered on a curtained stage featuring dancing girls, musical
acts and vaudeville routines. Two floors of private boxes rise
above the main floor, giving patrons a place to sit with a cold
drink and digest their dinner.  
 It’s a wonderful way to end the evening. Just remember to
hold the pour so you don’t overindulge and miss the World Expo.
