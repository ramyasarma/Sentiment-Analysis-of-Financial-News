             Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
to export terminals near New Orleans widened relative to Chicago
futures after a drop in prices from a three-month high
discouraged U.S. farmers from selling inventories.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for deliveries this month
was 40 cents to 46 cents a bushel above May futures yesterday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, compared with 41 cents to 42 cents
on April 23, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. A week
earlier, premiums were 36 cents to 38 cents.  
 “There was not much interest in selling soybeans” after
CBOT futures slipped from the day’s high, said Bryce Stremming,
a risk consultant for Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in Bloomington,
Illinois. “There is just enough demand” to support the spot-
basis bids, he said.  
 Soybean futures for May delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $9.9875 a bushel yesterday on the CBOT, after
earlier touching $10.095, the highest since Jan. 12.  
 U.S. government officials inspected 8.029 million bushels
for export in the week ended April 22, less than half of the
16.362 million inspected a week earlier, USDA data show. China
accounted for 30 percent of the total, down from 44 percent a
week earlier.  
 Brazil and Argentina are the world’s biggest growers and
shippers after the U.S., and they will produce a record 121.5
million metric tons combined this year, up 35 percent from 2009,
the USDA said earlier this month. Brazil will finish its harvest
this month, followed by Argentina in May.  
 World inventories on Sept. 30 are forecast to reach 62.963
million tons, up 47 percent from 42.821 million a year earlier,
the USDA said April 9. Stockpiles would be above the record of
62.957 million reached in 2007.  
 “The world is awash in soybeans and demand is going to
continue to shift away from U.S. supplies,” Stremming said.
