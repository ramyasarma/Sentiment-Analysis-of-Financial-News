             (Corrects Nissan’s U.S. output in final paragraph.)  
 Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co.
and Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s three biggest automakers,
increased global auto production in March as demand rose in Asia
and the U.S.  
 Toyota’s output surged 97 percent to 773,297 vehicles from
392,882 a year earlier, the Toyota City-based company said in a
statement today. Honda increased production 62 percent to
349,425 vehicles and Nissan boosted output 85 percent to 318,827,
the companies said separately.  
 The automakers built more vehicles as demand recovered in
the U.S. and Japan and continued climbing in China, the world’s
biggest auto market. A year ago, carmakers scaled back output,
temporarily halting production lines to reduce inventory amid a
recession.  
 Toyota shares rose 3.4 percent, the most since March 8, to
close at 3,690 yen in Tokyo trading. Honda gained 3 percent to
3,310 yen and Nissan climbed 2.9 percent to 815 yen.  
 Toyota’s global output for the year ended March 31 rose 0.7
percent to 8.2 million vehicles from a year earlier, while
Honda’s production fell 7.5 percent to 3.3 million and Nissan’s
gained 7.8 percent to 3.1 million.  
 Auto sales in the U.S. rose for a fifth month in March.
Toyota’s deliveries in the country jumped 41 percent from a year
earlier to 186,863 as the carmaker offered no-interest loans and
discount leases to win back buyers after recalling more than 8
million vehicles worldwide for problems including unintended
acceleration.  
 China Production  
 The company raised U.S. production 138 percent in March to
107,227 vehicles. Toyota’s output in Japan increased 115 percent
to 347,281 and exports rose 103 percent to 161,831.  
 Toyota also boosted March production in China, by 135
percent to 79,757 vehicles. Industrywide sales of passenger cars
in the country rose 63 percent from a year earlier to 1.26
million vehicles.  
 Toyota’s full-year sales in China may exceed an 800,000-
unit target, Masahiro Kato, president of the company’s China
business, said at the Beijing Auto Show on April 23.  
 Honda’s U.S. production increased 108 percent in March to
93,617 vehicles. The Tokyo-based company increased output in
China 36 percent to 65,283.  
 Nissan increased production in March by 61 percent in Japan
to 99,903 vehicles, including a 90 percent rise in exports, the
Yokohama-based automaker said. Its output in China rose 64
percent to 62,574, while U.S. production increased 94 percent to
48,804.
