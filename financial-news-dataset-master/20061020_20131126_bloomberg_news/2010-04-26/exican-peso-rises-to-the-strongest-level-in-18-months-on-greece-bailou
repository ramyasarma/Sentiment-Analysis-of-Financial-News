             Mexico’s peso rose to the strongest
level in 18 months after Greece said talks regarding a bailout
package may conclude “soon,” fueling demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  
 The currency increased 0.2 percent to 12.1516 per U.S.
dollar at 8:52 a.m. New York time, from 12.1795 on April 23. The
peso touched 12.1319, the strongest since Oct. 14, 2008. The
peso has risen 7.7 percent this year, the best performer against
the U.S. dollar of the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “It’s clear that sentiment in the market is back in for
risky assets,” said Clyde Wardle, an emerging-market currency
strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc. “ There is still an
expectation the situation in Greece will be resolved.”  
 Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou expressed
confidence yesterday that talks on a 45 billion euro ($60
billion) aid package from the International Monetary Fund and
European Union will be “concluded rather soon.”  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.6 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the securities
rose 0.2 centavo to 121.1 centavos per peso.  
 Mexico’s pension fund association said April 23 that its
members can invest as much as 20 percent of their assets in
foreign securities. Mexican government-regulated pension funds,
the largest institutional investors in the nation, agreed last
year to require all new money in the funds to invest in local
assets through Dec. 31.  
 The pension fund decision “was well known to the market,”
said Ram Bala Chandran, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. in New York. “I don’t think the market will care so
much.”
