             Asian stocks rose, driving up the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index by the most in almost six weeks, as
Toyota Motor Corp. and Canon Inc. led gains on speculation
earnings will increase as the global economy recovers.  
 Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, jumped 3.4 percent in
Tokyo after the Nikkei newspaper said the company had an annual
operating profit instead of the loss Toyota forecast. Canon, a
camera maker that gets 79 percent of sales outside Japan,
climbed 3.5 percent as the dollar strengthened after U.S. sales
of new homes gained faster than estimated. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. climbed 2.9 percent in Taipei.  
 “The world’s economy is more resilient than has been
thought, and investors are more inclined to put their money in
stocks,” said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior strategist at Tokyo-
based Daiwa Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent
of $91 billion. “With the current foreign-exchange level,
investors are confident in the corporate earnings outlook.”  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.5 percent to 127.22
as of 7:14 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest increase since March 17.
The gauge lost 2.3 percent last week after the U.S. filed a
lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and China stepped up
measures to curb property prices. Stocks in the index traded at
16.2 times estimated earnings on April 23, the lowest level
since January 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Nikkei 225 Advances  
 Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 2.3 percent to
11,165.79, the largest gain among equity benchmarks in the Asia-
Pacific region, and the most for the gauge since Feb. 22.
Taiwan’s Taiex index climbed 1.9 percent, the second-biggest
increase. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.6 percent.
Australian markets were closed for a national holiday.  
 South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.9 percent. The country’s
economic growth probably accelerated in the first quarter as
rising global demand boosted sales at carmakers and electronics
manufacturers, according to a Bloomberg survey of 12 economists.
The data release is due at 8 a.m. tomorrow in Seoul.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed. The gauge climbed 0.7 percent on April 23 in New York
to its highest close since September 2008. Sales of new homes
soared 27 percent in March, climbing the most in 47 years to a
level that surpassed the highest forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Orders for goods meant to last at least three
years, excluding cars and aircraft, gained 2.8 percent.  
 Toyota, Canon, Honda  
 Toyota, which gets about 31 percent of sales from North
America, advanced 3.4 percent to 3,690 yen. Toyota probably had
operating profit of as much as 50 billion yen ($530 million) for
the year ended March 31, Nikkei English News reported on April
24, without saying where it got the information. Cost cuts and a
weaker yen boosted revenue from overseas, the Nikkei said. The
company on Feb. 4 forecast an operating loss of 20 billion yen.  
 Ririko Takeuchi, a spokeswoman for the Toyota City, Japan-
based carmaker, declined to comment on the report. Toyota is due
to announce earnings on May 11.  
 Honda Motor Co., which is Japan’s second-biggest carmaker
and gets 44 percent of its sales in North America, climbed 3
percent to 3,310 yen. Canon increased 3.5 percent to 4,395 yen.
Toyota, Canon, Honda and Taiwan Semiconductor contributed the
most to the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s advance today.  
 The yen depreciated to 94.36 today against the dollar from
93.43 at the 3 p.m. close of Tokyo stock trading on April 23,
and weakened versus the euro to 126.30 from 123.69. A weaker yen
boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  
 G20, Recovery  
 Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s biggest maker of
customized chips, climbed 2.9 percent to NT$63.50 in Taipei.  
 Samsung Electronics Co., Asia’s No. 1 chipmaker, gained 0.5
percent to 834,000 won in Seoul. South Korea’s gross domestic
product rose 1.5 percent in the three months through March from
the previous quarter, when it advanced 0.2 percent, according to
the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
     Group of 20 finance chiefs, after meeting in Washington on
April 23, said the world’s economic recovery has “progressed
better than previously anticipated” and called for “credible”
plans to withdraw economic stimulus.  
 “The economic data has certainly outperformed a lot of
some people’s very skeptical expectations,” said Tim Leung, who
helps manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong
Kong. “There are good statistics coming out of the U.S. in
terms of economic recovery. We are cautiously optimistic.”  
 LG Innotek Co., a maker of electronic parts, climbed 9.6
percent to 159,500 won in Seoul. The company said first-quarter
net income more than doubled to 33.4 billion won ($30 million),
from 14.6 billion won a year earlier.  
 Oil, Copper Rally  
 China’s Shanghai Composite dropped 0.5 percent. The country
tightened real-estate financing by requiring developers to
submit fund-raising plans for review, stepping up efforts to
prevent a bubble, even as the central bank pledged to maintain
an “easy” monetary policy.  
 Copper and crude oil climbed on speculation Chinese demand
will boost consumption of commodities and as Greece moved toward
obtaining an emergency aid package. Oil rose as much as 0.6
percent to $85.63 a barrel, extending a 1.7 percent advance on
April 23, and copper climbed 1.4 percent.  
 Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said money
will be available “rather soon” and his country wouldn’t
restructure its debt. He was speaking to reporters in Washington
yesterday as he negotiated a three-year loan plan with the
International Monetary Fund and European governments.  
 Greece Concern  
 Concern that Greece may default on its debt helped drag the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index to its lowest this year on Feb. 8. The
index has rebounded 12 percent since then.  
 Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Japan’s second-largest copper
smelter, gained 1.4 percent to 1,434 yen. PetroChina Co., the
nation’s biggest oil producer, advanced 1.8 percent to HK$9.23.
Inpex Corp., Japan’s biggest oil explorer, rose 0.9 percent to
699,000 yen.  
 Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., the Chinese energy company that
paid more than $3 billion for Australia’s Felix Resources Ltd.,
surged 7.2 percent to HK$19.42. The company said first-quarter
net income more than doubled to 2.1 billion yuan ($307 million)
as the Chinese economy rebounded, spurring demand for coal.  
 In Manila, Petron Corp. climbed 10 percent to 6.60 pesos,
its highest close since November 2007. San Miguel Corp. said it
plans to buy the shares it doesn’t already own in the largest
Philippine oil refiner for 6.85 pesos a share.
