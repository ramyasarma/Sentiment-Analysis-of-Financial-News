             Redefine Property Ltd. may spend 8
billion rand ($1.08 billion) on acquisitions over the next year,
Johannesburg-based Business Day newspaper reported, citing Mike
Flax, the company’s executive director.  
 The company plans to sell 40 percent of its existing stock
to get rid of smaller properties and focus on larger, higher
profile complexes, he said, according to the newspaper.
