             De Beers, the producer of about 40
percent of the world’s rough diamonds, said demand for gems at
its fourth sale of the year beginning today is “strong” and
production in 2010 may increase by 30 percent.  
 Output may extend gains in 2011 to 40 million carats from a
projected 30 million this year, the Johannesburg-based company
said in an e-mailed response to questions today. First-quarter
sales were almost three times higher than last year, it said.  
 De Beers cut production 91 percent at the start of 2009 as
recessions in the U.S. and Europe slashed prices for the stones.
Rough diamond prices have since jumped 28 percent, a De Beers
presentation posted on parent Anglo American Plc’s Web site last
week showed.  
 “As the economic recovery continues, our production levels
are increasing,” the company said in the e-mail. “Our current
production plan is appropriate for the market.”  
 Global industry output peaked at about 160 million carats
in 2007 and may decline to about 120 million carats in the next
10 years or so as “no new material production is expected to
come online in the near future,” according to a copy of the
analysts’ presentation. Anglo owns 45 percent of De Beers.  
 De Beers’ production may plateau at about 40 million carats
a year from 2011, the Financial Times reported today, citing De
Beers Managing Director Gareth Penny.  
 “Given the sale of some of the De Beers assets over recent
years the fact is we don’t have the capacity to produce those
sort of historic highs that we have seen in the past,” De Beers
said in the email.
