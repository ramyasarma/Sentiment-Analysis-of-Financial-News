             Tunisia will produce 40 percent
less wheat this year after dry weather reduced yields, a unit of
U.S. Department of Agriculture said  
 Production will fall to 1 million metric tons in the
marketing year that begins June 1, down from 1.653 million tons
last year, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said in a
report posted today on its Web site. Imports may rise to 1.7
million from a projected record 950,000 tons this year,
according to the report.
