             Mediaset SpA may sue News Corp.’s
Italian unit if an arbitration court rules that it was unfairly
denied the possibility to buy the rights to broadcast this
year’s soccer World Cup, Chief Financial Officer Marco Giordani
said in an interview with Corriere della Sera newspaper.  
 “We were forced to resort to international arbitration,”
Giordani reportedly said. “We know that there’s not much time,
but we’re optimistic. If our position is recognized as
legitimate when it’s already too late, we’ll consider asking for
damages.”  
 The Fifa World Cup tournament, which is held every four
years, begins June 11 in South Africa.
