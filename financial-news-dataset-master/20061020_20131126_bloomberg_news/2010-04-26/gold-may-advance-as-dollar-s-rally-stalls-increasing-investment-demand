             Gold futures climbed to a one-week
high in New York as some investors sought an alternative to
currencies.  
 The metal priced in euros and Swiss francs climbed to
records. The euro fell against the dollar after the Financial
Times cited German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble as saying
Greece must have plans to reduce its deficit next year and in
2012, not just for this year, to qualify for aid.  
 “European retail demand for gold is good,” said Bernard
Sin, head of currency and metals trading at bullion refiner MKS
Finance SA in Geneva. “The market is watching very closely
developments on Greece. Anything can go wrong.”  
 Gold futures for June delivery climbed as much as $7, or
0.6 percent, to $1,160.70 an ounce, the highest price since
April 16. The contract was at $1,157 at 8:05 a.m. on the Comex
in New York. Bullion for immediate delivery was little changed
at $1,156.70.  
 “The risk of a serious and contagious sovereign debt
crisis is increasing and understandably this is leading to safe
haven demand for gold,” Dublin-based brokerage GoldCore Ltd.
said in a report e-mailed today. “A Western European country
has not defaulted on its debt since World War II, so the
implications of such a default are momentous.”  
 Greek bonds tumbled, pushing yields to the highest since at
least 1998. Greece needs to repay 8.5 billion euros ($11.3
billion) of bonds by May 19. Finance Minister George
Papaconstantinou, talking to reporters in Washington as he
negotiated a three-year loan with the International Monetary
Fund and European governments, said that money will be available
“rather soon.”  
 ‘Sense of Bullishness’  
 Gold in the morning “fixing,” used by some mining
companies to sell production, rose to $1,154 an ounce from the
afternoon fixing of $1,139.50 on April 23.  
 The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve in
two days may keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged,
economists said. The Fed has kept rates at zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008, helping send the dollar down and gold in
dollars to a record in December.  
 “As we move into the meeting of the FOMC later in the
week, that will give the market a bit more sense of the
bullishness toward gold against dollars,” Sin said.  
 Platinum for delivery in July gained 0.9 percent to
$1,757.30 an ounce and palladium for June delivery climbed as
much as 1.6 percent to $572.40 an ounce, the highest price for a
most-active contract since March 2008. Silver for July delivery
rose 0.9 percent to $18.39 an ounce.  
 The outlook for precious metals is “moderately positive,”
Credit Suisse Group AG said in a report today. “While we think
that platinum should continue to benefit from rising industrial
production, we expect gold and silver prices to climb only
slightly,” said Eliane Tanner, a commodity analyst.
