             President Barack Obama welcomes the
2009 world champion New York Yankees baseball team to the White 
House.  
 Obama, who frequently talks about his affinity for the 
Chicago White Sox, played host to Yankees’ players, coaches and
staff for the traditional White House visit for a champion 
sports team. The Yankees won their Major League Baseball-record 
27th World Series title last year over the Philadelphia 
Phillies. (Source: Bloomberg)
