             Stifel Financial Corp., the
Missouri-based brokerage, agreed to buy Thomas Weisel Partners
Group Inc. for about $318 million in stock to expand investment
banking.  
 Thomas Weisel investors will get 0.1364 shares of Stifel
for every share they own, the companies said in a statement
today. The purchase values San Francisco-based Thomas Weisel at
about $7.60 a share, 74 percent more than its $4.36 closing
price on April 23.  
 The deal will help Stifel add investment-banking clients in
the technology and health-care industries, the firm said. The
combined company will have estimated 2010 revenue of about $1.6
billion and a market value of about $2 billion, the companies
said. The merger will also make Stifel the largest equity-
research firm, with more than 1,100 companies covered.  
 “This is as good of a fit as I’ve ever seen in the
business,” Stifel Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ronald
Kruszewski said today in a conference call with investors.
“We’ve been playing in different sandboxes, and we are going to
combine those efforts.”  
 The purchase, set to close on June 30, is subject to
approval by Thomas Weisel shareholders and regulators. Thomas
Weisel had about 32.8 million shares outstanding at the end of
March. The $318 million valuation includes outstanding shares as
well as restricted stock units and warrants.  
 Stifel shares fell $2.33, or 4.2 percent, to $53.41 at
10:47 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Thomas
Weisel shares jumped $2.84, or 65 percent, to $7.20 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  
 Cost Savings  
 Thomas W. Weisel, founder of the eponymous firm, will
become co-chairman of Stifel with Kruszewski upon the completion
of the deal. Kruszewski will remain CEO and Stifel’s
headquarters will remain in St. Louis, the company said. As many
as three Thomas Weisel directors will join the Stifel board.  
 The firms estimate the merger will provide cost savings of
$62 million, or about 5 percent of the companies’ combined 2009
expenses. Kruszewski wouldn’t say when those savings are
expected to be realized. The institutional group and wealth
management each contribute about half of the revenue of the
combined firm.
