             Hitachi Ltd. said its full-year
loss was almost half the amount the company forecast, helped by
higher-than-expected sales at the divisions that make power
equipment and semiconductors.  
 The net loss in the year ended March 31 was 110 billion yen
($1.2 billion), compared with the 210 billion yen the company
projected, Tokyo-based Hitachi said in a statement today.
Earnings were also aided by cost reductions, it said.  
 Sales were 260 billion yen higher than the company
estimated, mainly because of the Power & Industrial Systems and
Electronic Devices operations, Hitachi said. That enabled the
company to post its second straight quarter of profit, it said.  
 Hitachi shares climbed 2.3 percent to close at 405 yen on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange before the company reported earnings,
extending their gain this year to 43 percent.
