             Poland’s main opposition party, Law
& Justice, will today name its Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a
former prime minister, as its candidate in the June presidential
election, Gazeta Wyborcza said, citing unidentified party
officials.  
 Kaczynski is twin brother of former President Lech
Kaczynski, who died in an April 10 plane crash and was the
party’s likely candidate in elections originally scheduled for
autumn.
