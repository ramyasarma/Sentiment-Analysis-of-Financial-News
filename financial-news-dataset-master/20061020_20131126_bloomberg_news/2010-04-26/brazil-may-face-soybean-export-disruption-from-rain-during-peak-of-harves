             Brazil may face soybean shipping
disruptions because of rains at the peak of the export season,
according to the head of commodity exports at Paranagua port.  
 “We are seizing every dry spell to load the ships,” Luiz
Antonio Borges da Silva of Brazil’s second-biggest soybean-
shipping port, said in a telephone interview from Paranagua,
Parana state. “The weather is our worst enemy.”  
 Ship loading at Paranagua was interrupted in the last three
days because of rains. A 30-kilometer (19-mile) line of trucks
is parked at the port’s inspection area waiting to unload newly
harvested beans and is close to full capacity, Silva said. The
bulk of soybean exports occur between March and May.  
 Weather institute Simepar, based in Curitiba, Brazil,
forecasts rains until April 28.  
 Soybean output in Brazil, the world’s biggest oilseed
producer after the U.S., will rise to 67.4 million metric tons,
from 57.2 million tons in the previous year, crop forecasting
agency Conab said April 7.
