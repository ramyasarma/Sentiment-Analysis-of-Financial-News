             South Korea’s won strengthened to a
19-month high as global funds pumped more money into the
nation’s shares to profit from accelerating economic growth and
increasing overseas sales.  
 The won gained for the first time in three days and
government bonds fell before reports this week that are forecast
to show gross domestic product rose at a faster pace in the
first quarter and exports climbed for a sixth month in April.
The Kospi index gained 1 percent, set for its best close since
June 2008, as foreigners bought more Korean shares than they
sold for a fourth day.  
 “Data this week is expected to be very strong,” said
Peter Redward, head of rates research at Barclays Plc. “Combine
that with strong risk appetite and very good demand for Korean
assets, which is reinforcing the won.”  
 The won rose 0.4 percent to 1,103.80 per dollar as of 12:52
p.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s
appreciated 5.4 percent this year and earlier touched 1,103.05,
the strongest level since Sept. 12, 2008.  
 A central bank report tomorrow will show the economy
expanded 7.5 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter,
the most since 2002, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Exports increased 32 percent
in April, based on a separate survey before government trade
data is published on May 1.  
 China, the No. 1 destination for shipments from South Korea,
will keep its “proactive” fiscal measures and maintain a
“relatively easy” monetary policy to spur a global economic
recovery, central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said April 24 at
an International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington. New-home
sales in the U.S., the second-biggest buyer of Korean exports,
rose in March by the most in 47 years, an April 23 report showed.  
 Bonds Decline  
 South Korea’s bonds fell. The yield on the 4.25 percent
note due December 2012 increased one basis point to 3.77 percent.
The rate this month reached 3.75 percent, down from 3.9 percent
at the end of March and the lowest level since the security was
sold in December.  
 “Risk-on at the start of the week and our above-consensus
GDP forecast point to a rough week for Korean government
bonds,” Tim Condon, chief economist at ING Financial Markets,
wrote in a report published today. “We think the 3-year bond
yield could re-test 3.9 percent this week.”  
 ING estimates the Korean economy expanded 11.2 percent from
a year earlier in the first quarter, which would be the fastest
pace in a decade.
