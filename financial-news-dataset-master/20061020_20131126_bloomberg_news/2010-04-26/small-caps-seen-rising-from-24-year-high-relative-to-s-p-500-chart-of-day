             Smaller U.S. companies will add to
their stock-market lead even after rising to the highest prices
relative to larger businesses in 24 years, according to Michael
Shaoul, Oscar Gruss & Son Inc. chief executive officer.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY illustrates the ratio between the
Russell 2000 Index, whose companies have a median market value
of $490 million, and the S&P 500, with a median capitalization
of $11.1 billion.  
 Last week’s closing level was the highest since July 1986,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Russell 2000 rose
for the fifth straight week, its longest streak in a year. For
the year, the small-cap index advanced 19 percent through last
week, beating the S&P 500’s 9 percent gain.  
 The ratio is likely “to gain considerable ground before
this rally has run its course,” Shaoul wrote today in an e-mail
to clients. The Russell 2000’s performance during the next slump
in stocks will be “the ultimate proof,” he added.  
 Assuming the index holds up relatively well, investors can
expect a “multi-month period of outperformance” from small
caps, he wrote.  
 The Russell 2000 surpassed the S&P 500 by 1.7 percentage
points last year, when stocks rallied, and 3.7 points the year
before, when they plunged.
