             PMI Group Inc. bonds rose to the
highest since 2007 after the mortgage insurer said it plans to
sell $600 million of convertible notes and common stock,
according to a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  
 The company’s 6 percent senior unsecured bonds due in 2016
rose 5 cents on the dollar to 88 cents to yield 8.47 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s the highest
since December 2007.   
 The offering will consist of $200 million of convertible
notes due in 2020 and $400 million of common stock, Walnut
Creek, California-based PMI said in the statement.
