             Russian stocks headed for their
biggest two-day gain in two weeks as commodities advanced and
Credit Suisse Group AG and VTB Capital recommended the country’s
equities, saying shares will rally further.  
 OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, climbed 1.4
percent. The country’s largest oil producers, OAO Lukoil and OAO
Rosneft, gained more than 1 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index rose 1.3 percent to 1,623.38, extending this year’s rally
to 12 percent, at 3:21 p.m. in Moscow. The 30-stock Micex Index
added 1 percent to 1,482.23.  
 Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, advanced as much as 51
cents to $85.63 a barrel in New York as sentiment toward the
strength of the global economy improved. China will unveil a new
economic stimulus package, the China Business newspaper said
today. A report on April 23 showed sales of new U.S. homes
surged 27 percent in March.  
 “Stocks are supported by the strong, positive
macroeconomic newsflow out of the U.S. and Asia,” said Vladimir
Osakovsky, an economist at UniCredit SpA in Moscow.  
 Russian stocks were raised to 5 percent “overweight” from
5 percent “underweight” at Credit Suisse, which cited
“supportive” fund flows and a potential 10 percent upside to
the RTS. The gauge, the best performer worldwide last year, will
rally about 25 percent to 2,000 by the end of the year, VTB
Capital analysts said in a report today.  
 ‘Benign’ Oil Prices  
 “The re-rating will be sustained by the earnings momentum,
driven by benign conditions in the commodity markets and a solid
domestic macro policy framework,” VTB analysts including Alexey
Zabotkin said in the report.  
 Three-month copper advanced as much as 1.5 percent to
$7,865 a metric ton in London. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s
biggest miner, gained 1.5 percent to 5,669.70 rubles.  
 OAO Severstal was 1.3 percent higher at 392.27 rubles after
the nation’s biggest steelmaker said first-quarter output rose 2
percent from the previous three-month period to 4.73 million
tons. It earlier climbed as much as 3.5 percent.
