             The U.S. Supreme Court, rejecting a
bid by Michigan, refused to order Illinois and the federal
government to permanently separate the waters of Chicago-area
rivers and canals from Lake Michigan to stop the migration of
Asian carp.  
 Today’s rebuff was the third this year for Michigan at the
nation’s highest court, which previously declined to order the
temporary closing of area locks and dams as a step to keep the
carp from entering Lake Michigan. Illinois officials and
President Barack Obama’s administration urged the court not to
get involved.  
 Michigan and other Great Lakes states say that, should the
carp reach Lake Michigan, they would spread rapidly, consume
nutrients needed by other species and potentially devastate the
region’s $7 billion sport-fishing industry and much of its
tourism business.  
 “The fight to protect Michigan’s jobs and environment now
falls to President Obama and Congress,” Michigan Attorney
General Mike Cox said in a statement.  
 Illinois and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told the
Supreme Court they are already stepping up their fight to keep
the fish from reaching Lake Michigan.  
 “The state of Illinois will continue its extensive work in
collaboration with the federal government and all the Great
Lakes states to protect the ecology and health of the Great
Lakes by combating the progression of Asian carp,” Illinois
Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a statement.  
 As part of its bid for Supreme Court intervention, Michigan
sought to reopen an 80-year-old high court case centering on the
allocation of Lake Michigan water rights.  
 The dispute has divided the Great Lakes region. Minnesota,
Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania and Ontario have all backed
Michigan at the Supreme Court.  
 The lead case is State of Wisconsin v. State of Illinois,
No. 1, Original.
