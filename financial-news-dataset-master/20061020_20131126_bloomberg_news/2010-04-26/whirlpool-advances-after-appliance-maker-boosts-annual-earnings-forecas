             Whirlpool Corp., the world’s
largest appliance maker, advanced to the highest level in almost
three years in New York trading after increasing its forecast
and posting earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  
 Earnings will be as much as $8.50 a share this year,
compared with a previous forecast of at most $7, the Benton
Harbor, Michigan-based company said in a statement today.
Excluding some items, profit will total $8.10 to $8.60,
Whirlpool said. Analysts predicted earnings of $6.83, the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The company said increased sales volumes and productivity
improvements contributed to the first-quarter profit. Whirlpool
won new contracts from homebuilders such as Beazer Homes USA
Inc. and Toll Brothers Inc., boosting North American sales 7
percent. Sales in Latin America, which account for 21 percent of
the total, soared 65 percent on rising demand in countries like
Brazil.  
 “People expected a bit of recovery in North America, so
that was in context,” said Mirko Mikelic, a Grand Rapids,
Michigan-based bond fund manager with Fifth Third Asset
Management. “The big surprise was Latin America. No one was
expecting that. Brazil was huge.” Fifth Third manages $14
billion in fixed-income assets, including Whirlpool.  
 Net Income  
 Net income more than doubled to $164 million, or $2.13 a
share, from $68 million, or 91 cents, a year earlier, the maker
of KitchenAid refrigerators and Maytag washing machines said.
Excluding some items, profit was $2.51 a share. Sales increased
20 percent to $4.27 billion. Whirlpool reduced selling and
administrative costs to 8.7 percent of sales from 9.2 percent in
the year-ago quarter.  
 “While there is still some degree of uncertainty in many
facets of the global economy, we continue to expect growth
throughout this year in almost all the markets around the
world,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig said today on a
conference call with analysts.  
 Whirlpool climbed $10.20, or 10 percent, to $112.42 at 4:03
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, for the
biggest one-day gain in a year and the highest price since July
2007. The stock has added 39 percent this year.
