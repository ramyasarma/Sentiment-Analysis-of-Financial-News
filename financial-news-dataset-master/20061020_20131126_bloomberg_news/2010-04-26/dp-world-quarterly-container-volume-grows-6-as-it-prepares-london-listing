             DP World Ltd., the world’s fourth-
biggest port operator, said first-quarter volumes in 27 ports
the company consolidates for accounting purposes grew 6 percent
to 6.3 million 20-foot equivalent container units.  
 The increase was driven primarily by the Indian
Subcontinent and Australia as well as some volume growth in
European ports, DP World said in a statement to Nasdaq Dubai
today. Gross volume at 49 terminals the company operates grew 15
percent to 11.2 million TEU.  
 “The return of volume growth in 2010, combined with cost
reduction and efficiency initiatives, will deliver an
improvement in results over last year,” it said.  
 DP World said it remains committed to listing its shares on
the London Stock Exchange and is focused on completing the
process as soon as possible.
