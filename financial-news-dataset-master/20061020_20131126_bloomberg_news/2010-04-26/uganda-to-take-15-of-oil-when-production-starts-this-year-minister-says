             Uganda’s planned National Oil Co.
will get 15 percent of the country’s oil when production starts
later this year, according to the Minister of State for Mineral
Development, Peter Lokeris.  
 Tullow Oil Plc, the U.K. explorer with the most licenses in
Africa, and its partners, Total SA and China National Offshore
Oil Corp., will share the remaining 85 percent on an equal
basis, Lokeris said in an interview on April 24. The East
African nation plans to introduce a new oil and gas law in June
ahead of the start of oil production, he said.  
 Uganda aims to begin producing oil later this year when
Tullow starts output from its Kasamene field. The U.K.-based
explorer has found about 700 million barrels of oil in the
country and said it believes about 1.5 billion barrels are still
to be discovered.  
 Talks between the government and oil companies about the
development of Uganda’s other oil resources will be concluded by
about mid-June, Lokeris said. Talks have dragged on since
February because Tullow was initially opposed to paying a gains
tax on the fields it plans to buy from Heritage Oil Plc.  
 “There was some contention when Tullow said they wouldn’t
pay when they hadn’t started producing the oil,” said the
minister. “We are asking for 30 percent of the gains tax.”  
 In February the government approved Tullow’s purchase of
Heritage’s share of blocks 1 and 3A of Uganda’s Lake Albert Rift
Basin for $1.5 billion. Uganda will base its tax demand on $1.35
billion because Heritage invested $150 million in the blocks,
said Lokeris.
