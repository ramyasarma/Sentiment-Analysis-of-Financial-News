             Euro Stoxx 50 Index futures may
be poised for a retreat, according to Technical Analysis
Reports.com Ltd.  
 A drop in the Euro Stoxx 50 futures contract expiring
in June below the so-called 50 percent Fibonacci support
level of 2,869 may signal a decline to as low as 2,839.  
 “The trend is for lower prices and the 60 minute
stochastic is overbought so 2,869 will be important,” Carol
Harmer, chief technical analyst at London-based Technical
Analysis Reports.com Ltd., wrote in a note dated today.  
 In technical analysis, stochastics analyze momentum to
capture a security’s turns in direction.  
 A Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two
extreme points on a stock chart and dividing the vertical
distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6 percent, 38.2
percent, 50 percent, 61.8 percent and 100 percent, according
to Investopedia.com.  
 Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are
drawn and used to identify possible resistance and support
levels. If a price breaks through one of the levels, it may
signal a move toward the next resistance or support point.  
 The Euro Stoxx 50 has surged 63 percent from a 12-year
low in March 2009 amid signs the global economy is
recovering from the worst recession since World War II.
Futures traded at 2,876 as of 12:55 p.m. in London today.  
 A rebound above 2,870 may signal a climb to the
resistance level of 2,883, according to Harmer.  
 “This is a good opportunity for sellers to regain
control of the market,” the analyst wrote. “Only above
2,887 would allow buyers to push higher.”
