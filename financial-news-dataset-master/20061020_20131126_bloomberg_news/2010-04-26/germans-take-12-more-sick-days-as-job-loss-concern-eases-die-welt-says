             Germany workers took 12 percent
more sick days in the first quarter of 2010 than in the same
timespan a year earlier as concerns about losing their jobs
abated along with the economic crisis, Die Welt reported, citing
statistics from the country’s health ministry.  
 The statistic, which encompasses all employees with
statutory health insurance, showed that workers missed about 2.1
days in the first three months of the year because they were
ill, according to the newspaper.
