             Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc,
Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and other oil companies are
being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over
employee compensation practices, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.  
 The investigation of whether the companies colluded to curb
employee wages has been open for several years and includes as
many as 12 oil companies, the newspaper said, citing the people.
The FTC may never file a lawsuit, the WSJ said. Calls to the
FTC’s public affairs office for comment went unanswered.  
 A federal appeals court reinstated in 2001 a suit accusing
oil companies including Exxon, Occidental Petroleum Corp. and
Sunoco Inc. of fixing employee pay. The plaintiff, Roberta Todd,
filed the suit in 1997 that cited meetings among the companies’
human resources departments where managers shared salary
information and surveys.  
 Calls outside of regular business hours to Exxon and
Chevron’s press offices in Dallas and San Ramon went unanswered.
Calls to Shell, Sunoco and Occidental also went unanswered.  
 The companies and the FTC have discussed possible
settlements over the course of the investigation and failed to
reach agreement, the WSJ said.
