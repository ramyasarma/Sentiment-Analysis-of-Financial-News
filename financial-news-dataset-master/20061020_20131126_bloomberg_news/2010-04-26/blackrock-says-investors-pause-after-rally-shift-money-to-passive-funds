             BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest
asset manager, said inflows into its funds slowed as clients re-
evaluated their investments after last year’s rally in financial
markets.  
 “Institutional investors stepped back to reassess their
asset-allocation strategies,” Laurence D. Fink, chairman and
chief executive officer, said today in a statement.
“Institutional ‘re-risking’ activity slowed down and
reallocations focused primarily on shifting from active to
passive and from money-market funds to deposits.”  
 BlackRock’s net income in the first quarter increased to
$423 million, or $2.17 a share, from $84 million, or 62 cents, a
year earlier after the New York-based company acquired the
investment unit of Barclays Plc. Net outflows from cash-
management funds were $39.6 billion, BlackRock said in the
statement. Net inflows were $8.9 billion in long-term funds,
including equities, fixed-income and alternative investments.  
 Excluding costs related to the acquisition and other
expenses, BlackRock’s profit was $2.40 a share, missing the
$2.44 average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Fink has built BlackRock into the world’s biggest asset
manager with the Dec. 1 purchase of London-based Barclays Plc’s
investment unit, which added the largest lineup of exchange-
traded funds and more than doubled assets to $3.36 trillion.  
 Fund Flows  
 Investors put $4.6 billion into stock index funds and $900
million into active equity strategies during the quarter,
BlackRock said. Quantitative funds, which use mathematical
models to pick stocks, had $8.8 billion in outflows. Index bond
funds and exchange-traded funds gathered $13.6 billion, while
investors pulled $14.4 billion from active bond funds as
institutions made changes to asset allocations, BlackRock said.  
 BlackRock attracted $41.8 billion in deposits into long-
term funds and $400 million into money funds during the prior
quarter.  
 “It was a mixed quarter and flows were certainly light,”
Jeffrey Hopson, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in St.
Louis, said in an interview. “This doesn’t change our view that
the BGI transaction will prove to be an excellent one.”  
 Inflows into passive funds and alternative products will
help add $200 billion in new business annually over the next
five years, President Robert Kapito said in an April 9
interview.  
 BlackRock’s $15.2 billion purchase of Barclays Global
Investors is the biggest to combine an active manager with one
that manages passive investments, such as ETFs. BlackRock’s
IShares unit managed $509 billion in assets as of March 31.
Alternative strategies such as hedge funds account for $102
billion.  
 Asset Surge  
 Exchange-traded fund assets in the U.S. surged 67 percent
to $750 billion in the year ended in February, according to data
from the Investment Company Institute in Washington, as
investors sought low-cost alternatives to active funds. Mutual
funds in the U.S. held $10.97 trillion as of February, according
to the ICI.  
 BlackRock expanded its equity business with the 2006
purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co.’s money-management unit.
Including the equity assets from its BGI purchase, BlackRock now
has about 47 percent of its assets, or $1.58 trillion, in stock
funds. BlackRock’s stock funds alone hold more in assets than
Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which managed $1.5 trillion
as of Dec. 31. BlackRock has about a third in bonds, placing it
ahead of rival Pacific Investment Management Co.  
 BlackRock announced earnings before the start of regular
U.S. trading. BlackRock shares have declined 8.7 percent this
year, compared with the 9.8 percent gain in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.
