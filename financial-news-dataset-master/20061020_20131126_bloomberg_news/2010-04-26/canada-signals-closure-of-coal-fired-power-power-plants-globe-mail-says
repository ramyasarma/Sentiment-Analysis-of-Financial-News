             Canadian Environment Minister Jim
Prentice told the country’s major electricity producers they
will have to gradually close their coal-fired generators and
replace them with cleaner fuel such as natural gas, the Globe
and Mail said.  
 Power producers would have to retire coal-fired plants as
they reach the end of their commercial life over the next 10 to
15 years and not be allowed to refurbish them for coal unless
their emissions are captured and stored, the newspaper reported
today, citing unidentified people. Prentice met with utility
executives last week, it said.  
 The government is slowly shifting its greenhouse-gas
targets to low-emitting sources, which includes natural gas,
nuclear, wind and solar power, the Globe said.
