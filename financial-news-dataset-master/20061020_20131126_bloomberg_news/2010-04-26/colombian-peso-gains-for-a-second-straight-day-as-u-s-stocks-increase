             Colombia’s peso strengthened for a
second day as gains in U.S. stocks buoyed appetite for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  
 “U.S. stocks started out positively this week and that’s
helping gains in currencies across the region,” said Camilo
Perez, head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the country’s second-
biggest bank.  
 The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,947.80 per U.S.
dollar at 2:31 p.m. New York time, from 1,951.05 on April 23.
The peso has dropped 1.4 percent this month.  
 Most U.S. stocks rose amid improving earnings at
Caterpillar Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average advanced 0.3 percent.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.28
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.045 centavo to 118.226 centavos per peso.  
 The Finance Ministry last week swapped 3.5 trillion pesos
($1.8 billion) of bonds due between 2010 and 2015 to extend
maturities as the government faces its biggest budget deficit in
five years.
