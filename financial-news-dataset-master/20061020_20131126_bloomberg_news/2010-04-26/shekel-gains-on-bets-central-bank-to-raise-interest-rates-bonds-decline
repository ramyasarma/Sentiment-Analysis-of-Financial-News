             Israel’s shekel strengthened to the
highest level in a week against the U.S. dollar as economists
estimate the central bank will raise interest rates for the
fifth time since August to curb inflation.  
 Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer will increase its
benchmark rate by a quarter-point to 1.75 percent today in
Jerusalem, according to eight of 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Consumer prices are forecast to rise by 2.6
percent in the next 12 months, according to a central bank
survey of economists released April 18.  
 “There is a general sense that if he doesn’t raise it this
month, he’ll do it in the next month, and that’s helping the
shekel strengthen,” said Rafael Gozlan, chief economist at Tel
Aviv-based Leader Capital Markets Ltd. “The shekel is also
gaining on global demand for higher yielding assets.”  
 The shekel rose 0.4 percent to 3.7190 against the dollar
and gained 0.6 percent to 4.9580 versus the euro as of 11:51
a.m. in Tel Aviv. The currency earlier advanced to 3.7125 per
dollar, the strongest level since April 19.  
 The central bank last month increased rates by a quarter-
point to 1.5 percent as the economy recovered. The bank on April
21 raised its 2010 growth forecast to 3.7 percent from 3.5
percent, saying exports will expand faster than expected. The
economy may grow 4 percent in 2011, according to the bank’s
forecast.  
 Israel’s bonds declined on concern rising borrowing costs
will prompt investors to trim holdings of fixed-income
securities. The Tel-Bond 60, an index of the 60 largest
corporate bonds by market value, declined for the first time in
five days, falling 0.1 percent to 252.  
 The government’s benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due
February 2019 dropped 0.19 shekel to 109.36, lifting the yield
two basis points to 4.81 percent.
