             Somalia’s Islamist al-Shabaab rebel
group executed a man accused of murder in front of hundreds of
residents of the capital, Mogadishu, today officials said.  
 Another man had his right hand cut off for stealing nine
mattresses, a witness, Yusuf Abdi Mowlid, said in an interview.  
 Al-Shabaab, which the U.S. says has links to al-Qaeda, has
used repression and a strict interpretation of Islamic law to
impose stability in many areas of Somalia, which hasn’t had a
central administration since the ouster of the former dictator,
Mohamed Siad Barre, in 1991, Human Rights Watch said on April
19.
