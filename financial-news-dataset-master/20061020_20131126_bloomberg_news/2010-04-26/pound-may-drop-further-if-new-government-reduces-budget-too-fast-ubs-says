             The pound may drop more if a single
party clinches a parliamentary majority in the U.K. election
next month and cuts the budget deficit too fast than if no clear
winner emerges, UBS AG said.  
 “Investors should be concerned if any party wins an
outright majority and cuts the budget too quickly while the U.K.
economy is fragile,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief currency
strategist at UBS AG in Singapore, wrote in a note to investors
today. “This could induce the Bank of England to resume
quantitative easing. A similar mix of monetary and fiscal
policies in 1981 resulted in sterling weakening for years.”  
 Opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron has said
tackling the deficit is a top priority and that he would cut
spending this year. Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the Labour
Party has campaigned on plans to delay curbing the deficit and
keep up spending to support the economic recovery, which showed
signs of losing steam in the first quarter.  
 Opinion polls suggest neither Labour, the Conservatives nor
the Liberal Democrats will win enough votes for a majority in
the May 6 vote.  
 “The pound may fall initially if the U.K. election results
in a hung parliament,” Mohi-uddin said. “But we think sterling
weakness here would be short-lived. All three political parties
are committed to cutting Britain’s record budget deficit. Any
future coalition would agree to tighten fiscal policy through a
new budget this summer.”
