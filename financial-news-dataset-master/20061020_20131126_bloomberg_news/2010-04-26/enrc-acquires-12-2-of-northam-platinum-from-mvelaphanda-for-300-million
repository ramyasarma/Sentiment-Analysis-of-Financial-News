             Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., a
Kazakh metal producer, bought 12 percent of Northam Platinum
Ltd. for about 2.2 billion rand ($299 million) as it diversifies
its output and where the company operates.  
 ENRC acquired 44 million Northam shares from Mvelaphanda
Resources Ltd. for 50 rand each, ENRC said in a statement today.
“Platinum is expected to benefit from increased demand and to
face supply constraints,” it said.  
 Northam operates the world’s deepest platinum mine in South
Africa, which has more than three-quarters of global reserves of
the metal used to reduce car emissions and to make jewelry.
Anglo Platinum Ltd., the biggest producer of the metal, sees a
global deficit this year of the metal, the price of which has
gained 52 percent over the past year.  
 “ENRC is comfortable with the interest it has acquired at
this stage,” spokesman Edward Orlebar said in an e-mail.  
 The company will probably acquire more of Northam “in the
weeks to come,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Leon Esterhuizen
wrote in a note.  
 ENRC last year bought Central African Mining & Exploration
Co. Plc, which has copper operations in the Democratic Republic
of Congo, and agreed in February to buy 90 percent of Zambian
copper producer Chambishi Metals Plc.  
 Northam gained 0.95 rand, or 1.8 percent, to 53.05 rand at
the close in Johannesburg. Mvelaphanda increased 0.7 percent to
52.59 rand. ENRC gained 3.5 percent to 1,257 pence in London.  
 The sale of the Northam stake will allow Mvelaphanda to pay
off “virtually all” of its debt and open the way for its
planned unbundling, James Wellsted, a manager at the
Johannesburg-based company, said by phone. The deal will cut its
remaining stake in Northam to 50.5 percent, Mvelaphanda said in
a statement.
