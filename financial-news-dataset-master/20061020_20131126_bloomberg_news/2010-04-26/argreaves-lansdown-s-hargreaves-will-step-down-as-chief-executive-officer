             Peter Hargreaves will step down as
chief executive officer of Hargreaves Lansdown Plc, 29 years
after he helped start Britain’s biggest retail brokerage.  
 Hargreaves, 63, will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer
Ian Gorham, 38, in the second half, the Bristol, England-based
firm said in a statement today. Hargreaves will stay on as an
executive director focusing on client relationships.  
 Gorham will become deputy chief executive officer
immediately, the firm said. He joined Hargreaves Lansdown as
chief operating officer in September from accountants Grant
Thornton LLP, where he had been head of financial services.  
 “The whole board and senior staff at Hargreaves Lansdown
are fully behind Ian’s appointment,” the stockbroker said in
the statement.  
 Hargreaves started the firm in 1981 with Stephen Lansdown.
They took the company public in 2007, since when the stock has
climbed 133 percent. Hargreaves owns 32 percent of the company,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He is the U.K.’s 111th
wealthiest person, with a personal fortune of 570 million pounds
($880 million), according to the Sunday Times Rich List.
