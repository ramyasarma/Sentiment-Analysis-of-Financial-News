             Utilities in the European Union
will burn more natural gas to save carbon dioxide allowances
through 2012 as the supply from auctions turns out to be lower
than needed for forward power sales, Deutsche Bank analyst Mark
Lewis said today in an interview.  
 The EU’s decision on auctions for phase three of its cap-
and-trade program gives it “pricing leverage,” Lewis said.
