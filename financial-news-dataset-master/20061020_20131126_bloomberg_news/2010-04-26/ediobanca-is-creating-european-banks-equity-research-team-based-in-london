             Mediobanca SpA, Italy’s biggest
publicly traded investment bank, is creating a team of stock
analysts who will cover European banks from London in a bid to
grow outside its home market.  
 Antonio Guglielmi, who joined Mediobanca from Bank of
America Merrill Lynch earlier this year, heads the team of nine
analysts and two salesmen covering European lenders, the bank
said in a statement. The group includes Alain Tchibozo, who
joined from ING Wholesale Banking this year, and Christopher
Wheeler, who previously worked at MainFirst Bank AG.  
 Mediobanca, which employs 12 analysts covering Italian
companies at its headquarters in Milan, is strengthening its
U.K. presence where the company seeks to offer lending and
acquisition finance. In covering European banks, Mediobanca will
be competing with the world’s biggest financial firms, including
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc.,
whose bank research teams were the top three as ranked by the
2009 Thomson Extel survey.
