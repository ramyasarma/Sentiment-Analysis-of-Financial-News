             Life Healthcare Group Holdings
Ltd., a South African hospital owner, hired Morgan Stanley, Rand
Merchant Bank and Credit Suisse Group AG to help sell shares in
its initial public offering.  
 Pricing for the shares, to list on Johannesburg’s stock
exchange by the end of June, is expected to be released the week
of May 24, Morgan Stanley Investor Services said in a note
today.  
 Life Healthcare, which owns and operates 62 acute-care
facilities with about 8,100 beds, plans to list 30 percent of
its securities, the Johannesburg-based company said in an e-
mailed statement April 23.  
 Shareholders in Life Healthcare, including Brimstone
Investment Corp. Ltd. and Mvelaphanda Group Ltd., will sell some
or all of their existing holdings to ensure the company has
enough free shares to trade when it lists, Mvela Group and
Brimstone said in separate statements on April 23.  
 RMB is also a shareholder of Life Healthcare, said Joandra
Griesel, a spokeswoman for the bank in Johannesburg. The lender
hasn’t disclosed how much it owns of the company or whether it
would sell any of its stake, she said.
