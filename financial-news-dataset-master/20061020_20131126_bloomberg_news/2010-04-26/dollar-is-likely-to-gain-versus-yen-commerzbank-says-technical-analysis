             The dollar may advance as high as
97.80 against Japan’s currency should it break through a so-
called resistance area between 94.80 and 95.10 yen, Commerzbank
AG said, citing technical indicators.  
 The 94.80 level is the dollar’s early April high, while
95.10 is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the decline
from the April 2009 high to the November low, according to Axel
Rudolph, a senior technical analyst at Commerzbank in London.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance or below so-called support indicates a
currency may move to the next level.  
 “A break above 95.10 brings the August 2009 peak of 97.80
into view,” Rudolph said in a telephone interview today.
“Declines should find support at the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement at 93.13 and along the two-month support line at
92.14.”  
 The dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to 94.16 yen as of
12:53 p.m. in London, after rising earlier to 94.36 yen, the
highest level since April 2.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  
 A resistance level is an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to sell a currency and a support
level is an area there they anticipate orders to buy a currency.
