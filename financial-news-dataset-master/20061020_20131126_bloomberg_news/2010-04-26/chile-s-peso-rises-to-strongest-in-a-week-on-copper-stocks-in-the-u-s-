             Chile’s peso rose to the strongest
level in more than a week as stocks and copper, Chile’s biggest
export, climbed.  
 The peso rose 0.4 percent to 519.03 per dollar, the
strongest level since April 14, from 521.05 on April 23.  
 Copper futures for July delivery gained 1.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.548 a pound on the Comex in New York, after
touching $3.5805, the highest price since April 16. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average extended a six-day winning streak.  
 The currency has appreciated 1 percent this month on
speculation the government and insurers will need to buy pesos
to help pay for rebuilding after the fifth-largest earthquake in
a century struck the country in February.  
 “U.S. markets are trading a lot better than they were in
the morning and that has provided extra support for the peso,”
said David Duarte, an economist at 4Cast Inc. in New York.
“There’s been a tug of war between dollar demand from pension
funds and peso demand from insurance companies. People are
starting to see insurance companies bringing in dollars to pay
for repairs from the quake.”
