             Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of
Bruegel, a Brussels-based research group, said it will take
“several years” for Greece to get its economy back on track
even after cutting its budget deficit by four percentage points
of gross domestic product this year from 2009’s 13.6 percent.  
 “Even if the Greeks succeed in bringing it down by four
percentage points, that’s still 9.6 percent. That’s still much,
much higher than anything that would keep the debt ratio stable,
especially with the economy sinking,” Pisani-Ferry said today
in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Brussels. “This
interplay between the debt dynamics and the economic dynamics
are the core of the issue and it’s going to take several
years.”
