in a note.  
 Bulgari SpA (BUL IM) fell 20 cents, or 2.9 percent, to 6.70
euros, dropping from the highest since September 2008.

rally of the stock and its demanding valuation,” it “would
take profit.”

in the company, Il Sole 24 Ore reported on April 24, without
saying where it got the information.  
 Indesit SpA (IND IM), Italy’s biggest home-appliance maker,
climbed 63.5 cents, or 6.9 percent to 9.88 euros, the biggest

supplement of the Italian newspaper.  
 Saipem SpA (SPM IM), Europe’s largest oilfield-services
