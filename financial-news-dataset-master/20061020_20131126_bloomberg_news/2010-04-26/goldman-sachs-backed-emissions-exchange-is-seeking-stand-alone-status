             The Green Exchange LLC, an
emissions trading platform that operates within CME Group Inc.’s
New York Mercantile Exchange and counts Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. among its members, has asked U.S.
regulators for permission to operate independently.  
 The trading platform has applied for designated-contract-
market status from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
Green Exchange said in an e-mailed statement today. With CFTC
approval, it could operate as a “stand-alone entity,” instead
of having its contracts for carbon-dioxide permits and other
pollution rights cleared through the Nymex, the company said.
