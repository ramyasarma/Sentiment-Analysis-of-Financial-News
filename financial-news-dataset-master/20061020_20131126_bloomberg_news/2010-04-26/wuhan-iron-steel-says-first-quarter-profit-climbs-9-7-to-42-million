             Wuhan Iron & Steel Co., the
publicly traded unit of China’s third-biggest steelmaker, said
first-quarter profit rose 9.7 percent as the nation’s stimulus
package revived demand from automakers and builders.  
 Net income rose to 288 million yuan, or 0.037 yuan a share,
in the three months ended March 31, from 262.5 million yuan, or
0.033 yuan, a year ago, the Wuhan, Hubei province-based company
said today in a statement to the Shanghai stock exchange. Sales
rose to 16.7 billion yuan from 10.9 billion yuan.
