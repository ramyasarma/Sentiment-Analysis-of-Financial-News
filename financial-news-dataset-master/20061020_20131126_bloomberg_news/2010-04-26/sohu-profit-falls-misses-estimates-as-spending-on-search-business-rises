             Sohu.com Inc., operator of China’s
fourth most-visited Web portal, reported first-quarter profit
fell more than analysts estimated after the company increased
spending on its Internet search business.  
 Net income fell 32 percent to $30.2 million from $44.6
million, Sohu said in a statement today. The Beijing-based
company was expected to post profit of $32 million, the average
of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sohu is raising spending to attract users to its Sogou
Internet search service after Google Inc. moved its Chinese site
offshore following a standoff with regulators in the world’s
biggest online market. Profit also fell as the spinoff of
Changyou.com Ltd. last year siphoned off online games earnings.  
 “We think Google’s exit provides an excellent opportunity
for Sogou to gain market share,” Paul Wuh, who rates Sohu
shares “buy” at Samsung Securities Co., wrote in a report
dated April 23. Sales from Sogou were expected to almost double
in the first quarter, Wuh said.  
 Sales increased 12 percent to $129.5 million, Sohu said.
Revenue from Internet advertising rose about 4 percent to $42.3
million, while online games sales gained 17 percent to $72.1
million. Operating expenses climbed 19 percent to $48.5 million.  
 Forecast  
 Second-quarter revenue is forecast to be between $139
million and $144 million, Sohu said. The company is expected to
have sales of $138.6 million for the period, based on the
average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sohu shares rose 2.4 percent to $53.02 on the Nasdaq stock
market on April 23. The stock has declined 7.4 percent this year,
compared with a 16 percent drop in shares of rival Chinese
portal Sina Corp. Changyou shares rose 3.4 percent to $35.23.  
 Sogou accounted for 1.1 percent of China’s Internet-search
advertising market last year, ranking it third behind Baidu Inc.
and Google in the country, according to iResearch, a Shanghai-
based Web researcher.  
 Sohu is China’s fourth most-visited portal behind Baidu,
Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sina, according to China Websites
Ranking, a site run by the Internet Society of China, which
compiles Web traffic information.
