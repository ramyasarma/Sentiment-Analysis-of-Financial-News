             Real estate investor Scott
Rechler’s RXR Realty LLC won exclusive negotiating rights to buy
340 Madison Ave., a midtown Manhattan office building, from
Broadway Partners, a person familiar with the deal said.  
 RXR is in discussions to pay $570 million, for the 22-story
tower, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the deal isn’t complete. At that price, the building would be
worth about $770 a square foot, based on the square footage
listed on Broadway Partners’ Web site. RXR, based in Uniondale,
New York, may buy the property in phases, taking only a partial
interest at first, the person said.  
 A deal for 340 Madison would help show a recovery in New
York’s office market, Woody Heller, executive managing director
at Studley Inc., said in an interview this month. Manhattan
commercial property sales tripled in value in the first quarter
to about $3.3 billion, according to broker Cushman & Wakefield.  
 The tower may become at least the third Manhattan office
building to sell this month. SL Green Realty Corp., New York’s
biggest office landlord, agreed to buy 600 Lexington Ave. for
$193 million, or $636 a square foot. Mexican billionaire Carlos
Slim will pay $140 million, or $343 a square foot, for 417 Fifth
Ave., a person familiar with the agreement said April 21.  
 Rechler, the former chief executive officer of Reckson
Associates Realty Corp., engineered the 2007 sale of that real
estate investment trust to SL Green for $4.5 billion. SL Green
resold two-thirds of Reckson’s portfolio of mostly offices in
New York suburbs to a partnership that would eventually become
known as RXR.  
 90 Percent Leased  
 The 340 Madison Ave. building is 90 percent leased, said
the person familiar with the transaction. The tower is 739,000
square feet, according to Broadway Partners’ Web site. It
occupies the entire block front between East 43rd and 44th
streets, a block west of Grand Central Terminal.  
 Broadway Partners, led by Chief Executive Officer Scott
Lawlor, has been unloading properties after buying $15 billion
of buildings since 2000, much of it with low-cost financing that
dried up after the credit crisis began in 2007. The New York
firm lost Boston’s Hancock Tower to foreclosure last year, and
forfeited 10 buildings, including 1000 Wilshire Blvd. in Los
Angeles, to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in July.  
 Calls to Lawlor and Rechler weren’t immediately returned.
Philip Russo, a spokesman for CB Richard Ellis Group Inc., which
is brokering the sale, declined to comment.
