             Bank Millennium SA, the Polish unit
of Banco Comercial Portugues SA, said first-quarter profit rose
almost sixfold as it cut costs and boosted lending income.  
 Net income advanced to 68.1 million zloty ($23.4 million)
from 12.1 million zloty profit a year earlier, the Warsaw-based
bank said today in a statement. That beat the 62.4 million-zloty
mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The bank’s net interest income, the difference between
what the company pays on deposits and what it charges on loans,
increased 70 percent to 217.4 million zloty, while net fees and
commissions rose 17 percent. Costs fell by 12 percent.  
 Polish lenders are benefitting from economic growth in the
only European Union country that made it through the global
financial slump without contracting last year. The economy
probably grew by about 3 percent in the first quarter, Michal
Boni, the chief adviser to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk,
said last week.
