             Philadelphia Phillies first baseman
Ryan Howard signed a five-year, $125 million extension that will
keep him under contract through at least 2016.  
 The agreement, which begins in 2012, includes a club option
for a sixth year that would keep Howard under contract through
the 2017 Major League Baseball season, the team said in a news
release posted on its website.  
 Howard, 30, will earn $20 million in 2012 and 2013, and $25
million annually from 2014 to 2016. He would earn $23 million in
the option year or receive a $10 million buyout, making the
contract worth as much as $138 million.  
 Howard, the 2006 National League Most Valuable Player, is
batting .275 with three home runs and 16 runs batted in this
season, starting all 18 of the Phillies’ games.  
 Since becoming an everyday player on July 1, 2005, Howard
has led all major leaguers with 222 homers and 650 RBIs. Along
with a .279 career batting average, the two-time All-Star had
his fourth straight 40 home run/130 RBI campaign last season,
joining Babe Ruth, Ken Griffey Jr. and Sammy Sosa as the only
players to accomplish the feat.  
 Chase Utley, the Phillies’ All-Star second baseman, signed
a seven-year extension before the 2007 season, likely keeping
the right side of the Phillies’ infield intact through at least
2013.  
 The Phillies, who lost in the World Series to the New York
Yankees last season a year after winning the championship, lead
the NL East with an 11-7 record.
