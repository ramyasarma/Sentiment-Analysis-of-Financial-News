             Companies listed on the Nigerian
Stock Exchange that fail to file financial statements by April
30 will pay a fine of at least 1 million naira ($6,658), the
Securities and Exchange Commission said.  
 As many as 143 companies are due to submit results,
including 122 first-quarter earnings, according to a statement
published on the Abuja-based regulator’s Web site today.  
 For every day companies don’t file, they will pay an
additional 25,000 naira, according the West African nation’s
Investments and Securities Act, posted on the commission’s Web
site.
