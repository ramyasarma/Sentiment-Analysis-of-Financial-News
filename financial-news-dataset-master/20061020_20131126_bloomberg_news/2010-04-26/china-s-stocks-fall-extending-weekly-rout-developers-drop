             China’s stocks fell, extending a
weekly slump, as developers and liquor producers dropped after
the government stepped up measures to curb property gains and
Kweichow Moutai Co. reported lower-than-estimated profit.  
 China Vanke Co., the biggest listed developer, fell to the
lowest in more than a year as the government tightened real-
estate financing. Moutai tumbled 4.8 percent as Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co. downgraded the stock. Beijing Gehua CATV Network
Co. led gains by cable-television operators after Citic
Securities predicted investors will shift funds from real estate
assets into shares of smaller consumer companies.  
 “Investors should avoid property stocks even though
valuations are low because the government still has more
measures to curb real-estate prices up its sleeve,” said Wu Kan,
a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “China has a limited number of
investment options; if the property market turns sour, money
will flow into stocks and that’ll boost the market.”  
 The Shanghai Composite Index lost 14.03, or 0.5 percent, to
close at 2,969.5, the lowest since Feb. 9. The measure swung
between gains and losses more than 10 times today. The CSI 300
Index slid 0.6 percent to 3,172.  
 The Shanghai gauge slid 4.7 percent last week, the biggest
weekly decline in five months, after the government banned banks
from financing purchases of third homes and required higher down
payments and rates for second homes. The measure has slumped 9
percent in 2010, the world’s fourth-worst performer, as the
government unwound monetary stimulus.  
 Vanke, Index  
 Vanke fell 1.6 percent to 7.80 yuan, its lowest close since
March 13, 2009. China State Construction Engineering Corp., the
country’s largest housing contractor, retreated 1 percent to
4.02 yuan, extending an annual decline to 15 percent.  
 An index tracking property stocks on the Shanghai Composite
lost 0.6 percent, extending last week’s 8.4 percent rout.  
 The China Securities Regulatory Commission has sent
financing requests from 41 companies to the Ministry of Land and
Resources for reviews of land use compliance, according to a
statement posted on the government Web site on April 24.  
 A weekly survey by SYWG BNP Paribas Asset Management Co.
and China Business News found that 87 percent of respondents
expect home prices to decline after the government imposed
measures to restrict mortgages. The survey was conducted between
April 19 and April 23, according to SYWG BNP Paribas in a
release.  
 Property Prices  
 Property prices in 70 Chinese cities surged by a record
11.7 percent in March, prompting the government to increase down
payment requirements, raise interest rates on second homes and
bar bank lending for third dwellings.  
 Rising property prices are a “major risk” to the economy
and the government must rein in speculation in the real estate
market, Li Daokui, an adviser to the nation’s central bank, said
in Beijing over the weekend.  
 Moutai, China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor by market
value, fell 4.8 percent to 136.93 yuan. The company’s 4 percent
first-quarter profit increase is lower than the market estimate
of between 15 percent and 30 percent, said analyst Tong Xun at
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. The stock was downgraded to
“outperform” from “buy” at the brokerage, which also reduced
Moutai’s earnings forecast by 10 percent.  
 Sichuan Swellfun Co., one of China’s four premium liquor
makers, lost 2.4 percent to 23.32 yuan.  
 Cable Networks  
 Beijing Gehua CATV, which builds and operates cable
television networks, gained by the 10 percent daily limit to
17.53 yuan. Shaanxi Broadcast & TV Network Intermediary Co.
jumped 2.8 percent to 14.04 yuan, the highest since January 2008.  
 China’s crackdown on the real estate market may trigger
outflows of about 400 billion yuan ($58.6 billion) from property
into equities, according to Citic. The funds may flow into
consumer-related stocks with small capitalizations and companies
that offer thematic investment opportunities, said analysts led
by Yu Jun at Citic Securities in a report today.  
 The following stocks also rose or fell in China trading.
Stock symbols are in parentheses after company names:  
 Jiangling Motors Corp. (000550 CH): The Chinese commercial
vehicle partner with Ford Motor Co. jumped 7.1 percent to 21.83
yuan. First-half profit may increase between 70 percent and 120
percent from a year earlier, Jiangling Motors said in a
statement.  
 Lingyun Industrial Corp. (600480 CH): The auto parts
manufacturer rose 1.5 percent to 15.29 yuan after Citic
Securities Co. recommended investors buy its stock, citing a
“stable” outlook for earnings growth.  
 Shanghai Hainiao Enterprises Development Co. (600634 CH), a
real-estate developer, dropped 10 percent to 11.41 yuan. The
company will be classified “special treatment” following a
consecutive annual loss, it said in a statement.  
 TBEA Co. (600089 CH), a Xinjiang-based Chinese maker of
electrical transformers, jumped 3.4 percent to 20.72 yuan. China
Business News reported the government may announce policies to
support the development of the northwest region in May.  
 Zhejiang Zhongda Group Co. (600704 CH), an apparel
manufacturer, rose 4 percent to 24.01 yuan. Citic Securities Co.
said the stock will “outperform” the market as the company
reduces debt and boosts earnings prospects.
