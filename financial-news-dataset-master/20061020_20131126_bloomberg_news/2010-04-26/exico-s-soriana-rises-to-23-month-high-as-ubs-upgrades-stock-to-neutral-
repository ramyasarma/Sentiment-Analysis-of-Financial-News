             Organizacion Soriana SAB, Mexico’s
second-largest retailer, rose to its highest price since May
2008 after UBS AG boosted its stock recommendation, citing
higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings.  
 Soriana rose for a third day, gaining 1.4 percent to 39
pesos at 1:51 p.m. New York time in Mexico trading. Shares
earlier gained as much as 2.1 percent to 39.25 pesos, its
highest intraday price since May 30, 2008.  
 The Monterrey, Mexico-based company reported first-quarter
profit rose 90 percent to 794.1 million pesos ($65.4 million)
from 417.4 million pesos in the same quarter a year earlier,
according to an April 23 regulatory filing. UBS upgraded the
shares to “neutral” from “sell” today and increased its
price forecast to 40.5 pesos per share from 35 pesos, analyst
Gustavo Oliveira said in a research note to clients.  
 The company’s first-quarter earnings “beat consensus and
UBS” earnings “by a wide margin,” Oliveira said in the note.
“Soriana could deliver better results over the next three
quarters,” he said.  
 Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB is the nation’s biggest retailer.
