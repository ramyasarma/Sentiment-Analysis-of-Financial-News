             New Zealand’s telecommunications
regulator will reconsider its recommendation on whether to
impose price control on the mobile phone market.  
 Communications Minister Steven Joyce asked the regulator to
review its recommendation that price control isn’t necessary, he
said in an e-mailed statement. Since the original recommendation
Vodafone Group Plc has released a new offer to customers which
may impact on competition, the regulator said last week.
