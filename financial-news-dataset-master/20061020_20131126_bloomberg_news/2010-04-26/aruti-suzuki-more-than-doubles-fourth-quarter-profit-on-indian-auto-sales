             Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the maker
of half the cars sold in the country, posted fourth-quarter net
income that missed analyst estimates as increased raw-material
costs eroded gains from selling more vehicles.  
 Net income in the three months ended March 31 more than
doubled to 6.57 billion rupees ($148 million), or 22.73 rupees a
share, from 2.43 billion rupees, or 8.42 rupees, a year earlier,
the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit said in a statement to the Bombay
Stock Exchange today. That was less than the 7.2 billion rupee
average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
increased 30 percent to 82.3 billion rupees.  
 Spending on steel and other raw materials rose 29 percent,
and New Delhi-based Maruti also incurred expenses upgrading
vehicles to meet new emissions standards. Sales of models
including the Swift and Ritz rose 21 percent as economic growth
and higher disposable incomes enabled more people to buy their
first car.  
 “The earnings have come in lower than expected largely due
to higher commodity prices,” said Umesh Karne, an analyst at
BRICS Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “Commodity prices are likely
to remain on the higher side in the next couple of quarters.”  
 Car, SUV Sales  
 Maruti sold 287,422 cars, vans and sport-utility vehicles
in the quarter, compared with 236,638 a year earlier. For the
full year, the company posted a profit of 25 billion rupees as
sales climbed 29 percent to a record one million units.  
 The company plans to spend 17 billion rupees to double the
capacity at its Manesar plant, outside New Delhi, to 550,000
vehicles during the next two years. Maruti’s factory at Gurgaon,
a New Delhi suburb, can produce 700,000 vehicles per year.  
 Shares of Maruti fell 2 percent, the most in more than a
month, to 1,333.7 rupees in Mumbai trading today. The shares
have declined 15 percent so far this year.  
 Maruti’s exports jumped 67 percent in the quarter to 42,040
vehicles. Maruti supplies its A-Star hatchback to Nissan Motor
Co., which sells it in Europe as the Pixo.  
 India’s vehicle sales may reach 3 million units annually by
2015, helped by new models such as Tata Motors Ltd.’s Nano, the
world’s cheapest car, and higher incomes among a middle class of
about 50 million people, according to a 2006 government forecast.
Industrywide sales in the year ended March increased at the
fastest pace in six years.  
 Indian economy  
 Demand in India’s $1.2 trillion economy, Asia’s largest
after Japan and China, gained with government stimulus measures
and lower interest rates. The nation’s service industries, such
as banking and hotels, rose for the 11th straight month while
manufacturing grew for the 12th month in March.  
 The Indian economy may expand 8 percent this year, the
central bank forecasts. Gross domestic product may have grown
8.2 percent last year, according to the finance ministry. The
Reserve Bank of India last week raised its key policy rates for
the second time in a month in a bid to cool the fastest
inflation among Group of 20 nations.  
 Surging demand for cars has prompted Toyota Motor Corp.,
Nissan and other automakers to expand in India. Toyota and
Nissan plan to start selling hatchbacks later this year in the
South Asian nation to capitalize on a strong preference for the
cars, which account for more than 70 percent of total sales.  
 Maruti, with its seven hatchbacks, had a 50 percent market
share last year.
