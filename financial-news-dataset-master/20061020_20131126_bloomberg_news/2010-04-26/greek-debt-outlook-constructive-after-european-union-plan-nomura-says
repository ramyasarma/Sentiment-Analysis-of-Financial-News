             The outlook for Greek debt is
“constructive” after the nation secured a promise of financial
support from its neighbors, and investors should buy shorter-
dated notes, Nomura International Plc said.  
 “Our base case is that policymakers in Europe will support
Greece,” Charles Diebel, a senior fixed-income strategist at
Nomura in London, said today in an investor note. “There is
still ample room for disappointment in this process, but the
outlook for Greek debt seems constructive relative to the
implications of current pricing.”  
 Diebel recommended investing in the “front end, as this is
where we think the best value lies as current valuations
contrast most with our view that a default will not occur.”  
 The two-year note rose, sending the yield 12 basis points
lower to 10.82 percent as of 8:38 a.m. in London.
