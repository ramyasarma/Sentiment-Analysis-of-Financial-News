             Crude oil was little changed as
speculation mounted that an economic recovery will stimulate
demand for oil, while a stronger dollar reduced the appeal of
commodities to investors.  
 Brent crude pared gains from an 18-month high in London as
the euro dropped for the seventh time in eight days on concern
the European Union-led Greek bailout plan will be held up. Crude
prices rose earlier, tracking global stock markets, as economic
reports pointed to faster global growth.  
 “The market is still under the spell of macroeconomic
factors like economic optimism, the dollar and high liquidity,”
said Eugen Weinberg, senior analyst with Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. “The situation in Greece has an indirect impact on
the oil markets through the U.S. dollar and equity markets.”  
 Brent crude for June settlement traded at $87.45 a barrel,
up 20 cents on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange at 11:43
a.m. local time. It earlier rose to $87.75 a barrel, the highest
intraday price since Oct. 7, 2008.  
 Oil for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
traded at $85.33 a barrel, up 21 cents, in after-hours
electronic trading. Brent is trading at a premium to the New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate futures as stockpiles at the
U.S. contract’s Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery jumped 5.8 percent
in week ended April 16 to 34.1 million barrels.  
 The dollar advanced to $1.3319 against the euro, after
dipping as low as $1.3397. The euro fell against all 16 of its
most-traded peers on concern the Greek bailout plan will face
hurdles as donor countries begin ratifying the aid package.  
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told the Bild-
am-Sonntag newspaper yesterday that his nation’s aid for Greece
can still be rejected.  
 Oil climbed 1.7 percent to $85.12 in New York on April 23,
the highest settlement since April 15, after government reports
showed U.S. sales of new homes surged in March and orders for
non-transport durable goods climbed.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their bets on rising oil prices in the week ended April 20,
according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  
 Speculative net-long positions, the difference between
orders to buy and sell the commodity, increased 7 percent to
121,475 contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
Washington-based commission said last week.
