             Unilever, the world’s second-
biggest consumer products company, said it will seek a buyer for
its Findus frozen food business in Italy as it shifts away from
local labels to focus on international brands.  
 Findus has annual sales of more than 450 million euros
($599 million) and a factory in Cisterna, Italy, the London- and
Rotterdam-based company said today in an e-mail.  
 Unilever plans to sell more personal-care products in
Europe following the acquisition of Sara Lee Corp.’s Sanex and
other soap brands. Four years ago, the maker of Flora spreads
and Axe deodorants sold its Iglo and Birds Eye frozen food
brands in countries including Germany and France to Permira
Advisers LLP.  
 Selling Findus “would enable us to focus on our other
categories, increasing investment in brands which will deliver
higher levels of growth and shareholder value,” James Hill,
chairman of Unilever Italy, said in a statement.  
 Founded as a canned fruit and liqueur factory in Sweden in
1905, Findus was purchased by Nestle SA, the world’s biggest
food maker, in 1963. Unilever in 1985 bought Nestle’s stake in a
joint venture the two companies had started in 1963 to sell
frozen foods and ice cream in Germany and Austria under the Iglo
brand and in Italy under the Findus name.
