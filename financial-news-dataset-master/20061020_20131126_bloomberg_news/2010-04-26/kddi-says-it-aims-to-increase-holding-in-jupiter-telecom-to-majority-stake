             KDDI Corp., Japan’s second-largest
mobile-phone carrier, said it aims to own a majority stake in
Jupiter Telecommunications Co., sending shares of the cable-
television operator to its biggest gain in two months.  
 KDDI President Tadashi Onodera told analysts on April 23
that the phone company “naturally” wants to own a majority
holding, without specifying a timeframe, according to a
recording of the meeting posted on the phone company’s Web site.
Hirofumi Morozumi, a senior vice president at KDDI, confirmed
Onodera’s comments today.  
 Sumitomo Corp., Japan’s third-largest trading house, this
month raised its stake in Jupiter to 40 percent to keep control
of the country’s biggest cable-television operator after KDDI
bought a 361.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) holding in February.
KDDI officials at the time said the carrier had no plan to
counter Sumitomo.  
 “After investing that much money in Jupiter we can’t risk
damaging its value, in that sense our interests fully coincide
with Sumitomo’s,” Morozumi, who became a board member of
Jupiter last month, said in an interview today. A struggle for
control “can’t happen,” he said.  
 Jupiter shares rose 3.2 percent to close at 97,500 yen on
the Jasdaq Securities Exchange, the biggest increase since Feb.
16. KDDI climbed 1.6 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
compared with the 2.3 percent advance by the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average.  
 Onodera’s comments came a day after he met with the head of
Sumitomo. The presidents of the two Tokyo-based companies agreed
on April 22 to begin discussions aimed at increasing the value
of Jupiter, KDDI said at the time.  
 KDDI, which bought the Jupiter stake from billionaire John
Mallone’s Liberty Global Inc. in February, has waived the right
to veto management decisions at Jupiter by retaining a 31.1
percent stake and placing the rest in a trust fund, after
Japan’s financial regulator questioned the deal’s legality.  
 “Naturally, we want to control a majority in the future,”
Onodera told analysts, according to the recording on KDDI’s Web
site. “I cannot comment on the timing because it will depend on
our partners.”  
 Earlier that day, Onodera told reporters at an earnings
briefing that the company has no immediate plans to increase its
stake in Jupiter.
