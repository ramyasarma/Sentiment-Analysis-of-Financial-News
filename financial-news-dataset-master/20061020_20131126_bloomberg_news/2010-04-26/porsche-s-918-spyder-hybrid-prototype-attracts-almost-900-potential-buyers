             Porsche AG said it has almost 900
potential buyers for its 918 Spyder hybrid prototype as the
manufacturer moves toward approving production of the vehicle.  
 Porsche, which unveiled the 918 Spyder at the Geneva auto
show last month, will probably decide to build the model once
1,000 potential customers have pledged interest, Porsche’s
development chief, Wolfgang Duerheimer, said in an interview at
the Beijing Auto Show.  
 “I’m confident that we will soon reach the threshold of
1,000,” he said in an April 24 interview. “We need 1,000
seriously interested people to make a sound business case.”  
 Porsche, based in Stuttgart, Germany, plans to add models
with a goal of doubling yearly sales to as many as 150,000
vehicles over the medium term, and benefit from savings from a
merger with Volkswagen AG. The two carmakers will conclude their
talks on a future model strategy and sharing platforms in about
six months, Duerheimer said.  
 “We’re very optimistic that we’ll be able to further
expand our leading position in the sports-car segment,” he
said.  
 The 918 Spyder, one of three hybrid models Porsche
presented in Geneva, relies on a 500-horsepower V8 engine and
electric drive-systems allowing the vehicle to go up to 25
kilometers on electric power. The two-seater limits gasoline
consumption to three liters per 100 kilometers, emitting 70
grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer.  
 Porsche expects sales in China, its third-biggest market
after the U.S. and Germany, to “clearly exceed” 10,000
vehicles this year, compared with 9,900 in 2009, Duerheimer
said. The new generation of the Cayenne SUV, Porsche’s best-
selling model, has “very good” prospects in China and order
books for the Panamera sedan are “well stocked,” he said.  
 Porsche aims to double its Chinese dealerships by 2012 to
more than 50 from 27 currently, he said.  
 “We expect that the desire for motorization in China will
continue unabated,” Duerheimer said.
