             Natural gas futures fell for the
first time in three days on speculation supplies of the
industrial fuel will be adequate to meet demand as the economy
recovers.  
 Gas supplies were 19 percent above the five-year average in
the week ended April 16, according to the Energy Department. Gas
advanced in earlier trading after Caterpillar Inc. posted its
first earnings increase in seven quarters.  
 “We’re still getting above-average seasonal storage
builds,” said Tom Orr, director of research at Weeden & Co., a
brokerage in Greenwich, Connecticut. “There was some economic
data that was favorable last week, but you have to see an actual
rebound in demand. We got a bit ahead of where we should be.”  
 Natural gas for May delivery fell 4.7 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $4.21 per million Btu at 11:06 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose as high as $4.313 per
million Btu before turning lower. Prices have dropped 24 percent
this year.
