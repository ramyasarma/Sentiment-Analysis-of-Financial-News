             Students, especially at for-profit
universities, are leaving college in the U.S. with a debt load
large enough to raise questions about the ability of many to
repay loans, a  study  found.  
 At for-profit colleges, 53 percent of the degree recipients
in 2008 had education-related debt of $30,500 or more, compared
with 24 percent at private nonprofit colleges and 12 percent at
public schools, the New York-based  College Board  said in a
report released today.  
 Students graduating in 2008 faced jobs prospects reduced by
the financial crisis and subsequent recession, the worst since
the 1930s. Whether the students can earn enough to repay their
loans is unclear, according to the study.  
 “Too many students are borrowing more than they are likely
to be able to manage,” wrote  Sandy Baum  and Patricia Steele,
the study authors, who are policy analysts for the nonprofit
College Board.  
 About a third of all bachelor’s degree recipients didn’t
borrow any money for college, according to the study. The report
was based on the 2007-2008 academic year, which is the latest
 available government data .  
 Seventeen percent of bachelor’s degree recipients had loans
of at least $30,500, enough to put them in the upper quarter of
borrowers in terms of debt load.  
 Of black bachelor-degree recipients, 27 percent had debt of
$30,500 or more, the researchers said. That compared with 16
percent of whites, 14 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent for
Asians.  
 “There is an urgent need for strengthening postsecondary
financing policies and for better guidance and improved
financial literacy for students before they borrow to finance
their postsecondary education,” the study authors wrote.  
 Repayment Terms  
 While  new repayment  options on federal loans promise to
help students cope with their debt, these choices don’t apply to
private loans “taken by many students with high debt levels,”
according to the report.  
 The U.S. Department of Education’s income-based repayment
plan limits the amount students are required to pay to no more
than 15 percent of discretionary income, Baum said.  
 The monthly payment is capped at an amount “intended to be
affordable based on income and family size,” according to the
department’s Web site. The payment will be lowered to no more
than 10 percent in 2014 for new borrowers.
