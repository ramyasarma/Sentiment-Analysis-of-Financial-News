             Triton, the private equity firm
that bid for Arcandor AG’s Karstadt department-store unit last
week, said the deadline to reach an agreement may be extended.  
 “We’re not fixed on timing,” said John Mengers, a
spokesman for Triton at CNC Communications & Network Consulting
AG in Munich. Thomas Schulz, a spokesman for the insolvency
administrator of Arcandor, said the retailer aims to reach an
agreement by April 30 and has received no other bids.  
 Administrator Klaus Hubert Goerg has been in talks since
February with six potential bidders, and has asked Merrill Lynch
& Co. to find an investor for Karstadt. The retailer, which
filed for insolvency in 2009, reached agreement with creditors
on an insolvency plan which includes reductions in rents and
workers’ wages as well as the cancellation of debt.  
 Triton plans to invest new capital in Karstadt and is
seeking concessions, Mengers said, declining to elaborate. The
private equity company is trying to save jobs at Karstadt rather
than cut them, he said.  
 Triton may study whether it could get state aid to make the
purchase, Mengers said, adding that no decision has been made.
