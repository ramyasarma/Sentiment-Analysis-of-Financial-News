             The U.K. market for small-scale
wind power plants grew by a quarter last year as turbine exports
jumped, according to RenewableUK, an industry group.  
 Domestic sales of wind generators for homes and small
businesses increased to 17 million pounds ($26 million) from
2008, the U.K. wind and marine energy association said in a
statement. More than 20 manufacturers exported 8 million pounds
of equipment, 45 percent more than the year earlier  
 “Excellent wind resources, new financial incentives and a
strong home manufacturing sector are helping the U.K. to
consolidate its position as a world leader of this technology,”
Alex Murley, head of small systems at the association, said in
the e-mailed release.  
 The U.K. is setting up a 2 billion-pound “green investment
bank” to promote low-carbon energy as part of its plan to cut
emissions, Chancellor Alistair Darling said last month.
Employment in renewable power, carbon capture and energy
efficiency may reach 1.27 million by 2015 from 881,000 in 2008,
according to a Parliamentary report.  
 Small-scale wind manufacturers employ 1,800 people,
RenewableUK said.
