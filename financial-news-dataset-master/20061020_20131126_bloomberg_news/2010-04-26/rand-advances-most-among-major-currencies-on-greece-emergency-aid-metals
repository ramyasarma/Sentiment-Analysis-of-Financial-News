             The rand posted its biggest two-day
increase in almost a month, the strongest major-currency gain
versus the dollar, as commodities prices rose, boosting the
outlook for the world’s biggest producer of platinum.  
 South Africa’s currency gained 1.2 percent to 7.3313 per
dollar before trading 0.9 percent stronger at 7.3524 by 4:02
p.m. in Johannesburg from a previous close of 7.4184.  
 Platinum, which together with gold accounts for 22 percent
of South Africa’s exports, rose for a sixth day, climbing 0.7
percent to $1,754 an ounce while palladium surged as much as 1.7
percent to a 25-month high after a report that Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s biggest carmarker, will post an operating
profit instead of a loss. Platinum is used to make pollution-
reduction devices for cars.  
 Gold for June delivery advanced to a one-week high in New
York as some investors sought an alternative to currencies.
Nickel, copper and lead also gained on the London Metal
Exchange.  
 The currency also strengthened as investors bet the central
bank will avoid cutting interest rates further.  
 “The rand is benefitting today from the stronger commodity
prices, the local interest-rate outlook and positive risk
appetite for emerging markets after Greece went for the aid
package,” said George Glynos, managing director of
Johannesburg-based Econometrix Treasury Management, which
advises clients on bond and foreign-exchange transactions.  
 Governor Gill Marcus said on April 22 the “scope for
further easing is limited” and the repurchase rate will
probably remain stable “for some time to come.”  
 Bonds Rise  
 South Africa’s rate at 6.5 percent compares with benchmark
interest rates of 0.25 percent in the U.S., 1 percent in the
eurozone and 0.5 percent in the U.K., making local interest-
bearing assets attractive to foreign investors.  
 Government bonds rose, reducing the yield on South Africa’s
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 by 1 basis
point to 7.74 percent. The bond’s price increased 5 cents to
124.89 rand.
