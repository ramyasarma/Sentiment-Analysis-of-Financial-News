             India’s 10-year bonds dropped for a
second day, pushing yields to an 18-month high, on concern
appetite for the debt will cool as the government steps up sales
to finance its budget deficit.  
 The government will issue 120 billion rupees ($2.7 billion)
of bonds on April 30, the finance ministry said today. The sale
will include a new 10-year bond for 50 billion rupees. The
Reserve Bank of India increased its benchmark policy rates by a
quarter-percentage point each at a meeting on April 20.  
 “The fact that the government’s borrowing program is
robust will continue to push up yields,” said Krishnamurthy
Harihar, Mumbai-based treasurer at the Indian unit of FirstRand
Ltd., South Africa’s second-largest financial services company.
“Given the outlook for inflation and the economy, more
interest-rate hikes are also expected.”  
 The yield on the 6.35 percent note due January 2020 rose
one basis point to 8.07 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price fell 0.06, or 6 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 88.58.
The 10-year yield rose as much as four basis points to 8.10
percent earlier, its highest since October 2008.  
 The Finance Ministry’s borrowing in April will total 490
billion rupees, 36 percent more than the same month last year.
The government has a record 4.57 trillion rupees target for the
current fiscal year.  
 Normal monsoon rains will help ease inflationary
expectations, Reserve Bank Deputy Governor K.C. Chakrabarty said
in Mumbai today.  
 Benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to 9.9
percent in March, the fastest in 17 months. Deutsche Bank
expects the inflation rate to be 6.5 percent by March 31, 2011,
more than the central bank’s 5.5 percent forecast.  
 Real Rates  
 Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao’s “cautious”
approach to raising interest rates runs the risk of causing the
economy to overheat, Deutsche Bank AG said.  
 “The Reserve Bank of India could well be faced with an
overheating economy in the second half of the year and be
cornered to raise rates more sharply and thus undermine markets
and the economy,” Deutsche Bank economists Taimur Baig and
Kaushik Das wrote in an e-mailed note today.  
 The economists said real interest rates in India would
still be negative even after a 100 basis-point increase in the
central bank’s benchmark rates. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  
 The Reserve Bank’s reverse-repurchase rate is currently
3.75 percent, the repurchase rate 5.25 percent and the cash
reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits that lenders should
keep with the central bank, is 6 percent.
