             Ukrainian lawmakers loyal to
President Viktor Yanukovych ratified a treaty extending the
lease on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet as opposition groups hurled
eggs and smoke bombs across the chamber in protest.  
 Yanukovych’s majority pushed through the ratification with
236 votes in the 450-seat parliament in Kiev. In Moscow,
Russia’s lower house, the State Duma, backed the treaty, which
must also be approved by the upper house, the Federation
Council.  
 The opposition, headed by former Prime Minister Yulia
Tymoshenko, said yesterday it would seek to block the treaty
that allows the fleet to remain until 2042 in exchange for a $40
billion gas subsidy deal from Russia. They say the treaty is
illegal as the constitution forbids the stationing of foreign
troops in Ukraine. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said there’s no
need for a referendum on the issue after the ratification.  
 The agreement “violates Ukraine’s national interests,
poses a threat for national interests and breaches territorial
integrity,” Ivan Kyrylenko, head of Tymoshenko’s parliamentary
group, said on television yesterday.  
 The clashes erupted in the chamber, with lawmakers throwing
objects and scuffling, after supporters and opponents of the
deal had gathered outside the building. About 7,000 people are
involved in the demonstration and some have confronted the
police, local news wire Unian reported. Tymoshenko said on
television that she will visit the regions of the country to
push for early parliamentary elections.  
 Expiry Deal  
 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev agreed on April 21 to cut
natural gas prices for Ukraine by 30 percent. In return, Ukraine
will allow Russia to keep its fleet in the country after the
expiry of the current lease in 2017 and increase the amount of
gas it imports.  
 The party of former President Viktor Yushchenko, who sought
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
European Union, had urged citizens to come to the parliament
building to protest, according to a statement on its Web site.  
 “In exchange for cheap gas, which leaves the economy
uncompetitive, they put at risk the most sacred thing for every
nation: its independence,” Yushchenko said on April 22. “One
should use straw as fuel but one should stay independent.”  
 The pro-Yanukovych majority in the parliament has the
backing of 53 percent of lawmakers.
