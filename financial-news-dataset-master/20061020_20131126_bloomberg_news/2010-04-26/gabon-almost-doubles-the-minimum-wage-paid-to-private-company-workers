             The government of Gabon will almost
double to 150,000 ($306) CFA francs the minimum monthly wage for
workers employed by private companies, Labor Minister Maxime
Ngozo Issondou said on national television yesterday.  
 The new minimum wage for 2010 applies to all workers except
for domestic staff and government employees, Issondou announced,
without saying when it will take effect. The minimum monthly
wage in 2009 was 80,000 CFA francs.  
 The West African country’s government will the workers a
“solidarity bonus” to make up for any shortfall between the
new minimum and their actual wages. It also raised the transport
allowance for such workers to 35,000 CFA francs to align it with
the allowance already paid to state employees, he said.  
 The new measures were endorsed at the last meeting of the
Council of Ministers on April 22, he said. The council was
chaired by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, who had promised during
his presidential election campaign to raise Gabon’s minimum wage
to 150,000 CFA francs.
