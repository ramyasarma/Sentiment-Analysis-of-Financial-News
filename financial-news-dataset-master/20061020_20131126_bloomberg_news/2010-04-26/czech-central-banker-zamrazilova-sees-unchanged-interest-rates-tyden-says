             Czech central bank board member Eva
Zamrazilova expects interest rates to stay unchanged at the next
policy meeting as she sees neither strong inflationary pressures
nor deflation risks, Tyden reported, citing Zamrazilova.  
 “I would rather expect stability, although it is really an
open issue,” the Prague-based weekly quoted Zamrazilova as
saying in an interview.  
 Zamrazilova, who voted for the benchmark two-week
repurchase rate to stay unchanged at a record low 1 percent at
the last monetary meeting on March 25, said on April 13 she will
not attend the next rate-setting session scheduled for May 6.
