             Lorillard Inc., the third-largest
U.S. cigarette maker, said first-quarter profit rose 26 percent
after its top-selling Newport brand added market share.  
 Net income advanced 26 percent to $232 million, or $1.50 a
share, from $184 million, or $1.09, a year earlier, the
Greensboro, North Carolina-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts predicted $1.22, the average of nine
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Newport, the biggest-selling U.S. menthol cigarette,
increased its market share by 75 basis points to 10.9 percent,
the company said. Lorillard’s shipments rose 12 percent to 8.86
billion cigarettes from the same quarter a year earlier.  
 Lorillard fell 70 cents to $78.87 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped 1.7
percent this year.
