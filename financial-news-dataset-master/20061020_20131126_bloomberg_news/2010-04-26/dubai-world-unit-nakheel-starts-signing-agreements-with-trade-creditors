             Nakheel PJSC, the unit of Dubai
World that is restructuring $10.5 billion of debt, said it
started signing settlement agreements to pay trade creditors.  
 Nakheel will pay 40 percent of the amount owed in cash and
an annual return of 10 percent on the recovered claims, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. The remaining 60
percent will be paid in publicly traded securities and creditors
will get the cash payment “as soon as an agreement on 65
percent of the total agreed claims” is reached, Nakheel said.  
 “This is expected to be achieved in the very near
future,” the company said. “All indications suggest that this
will be a prompt process.”  
 Nakheel and its parent Dubai World, one of the emirate’s
three main state-owned holding companies, are trying to
renegotiate $24.8 billion of debt after the global credit crisis
battered Dubai’s real-estate market and left the emirate’s
companies unable to raise loans.  
 Dubai World asked almost 100 creditors on March 25 to roll
over liabilities into two new loans of five- and eight-year
maturities. Dubai World is offering to pay bank creditors 1
percent interest on new loans as part of the restructuring plan,
a banker familiar with the plan said earlier this month.  
 Nakheel had unpaid bills, or accounts payable and accruals,
of 28.6 billion dirhams ($7.8 billion) at the end of June, the
last period for which financial results are available.  
 The company’s $750 million Islamic bond due January was
unchanged at $1.02 as of 3:11 p.m. in Dubai today.
