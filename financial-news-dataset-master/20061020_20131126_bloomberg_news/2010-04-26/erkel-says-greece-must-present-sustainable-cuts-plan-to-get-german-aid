             German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said she won’t release Greek rescue funds until the country
shows it’s got a “sustainable, credible” plan to cut its
budget deficit. A decision may be in a “few days,” she said.  
 Greek bonds plunged today, sending yields to the highest
since 1998, amid concern Germany is delaying approval of a $60
billion rescue plan that would be co-financed by the euro region
and the International Monetary Fund. The extra yield that
investors demand to hold Greek 10-year debt over German bunds
climbed 75 basis points to 634 basis points.  
 “I’ve said for weeks that Greece must do its homework
first,” Merkel said, drawing applause at a regional election
rally today in the western German town of Soest. “We’re not
doing this because we believe Greece needs help. We’re doing it
because we’re interested in the euro’s stability. We can’t idly
stand by when our currency comes under threat.”  
 Merkel, in earlier remarks to reporters in Berlin, said
there would be no decision on aid for Greece until the IMF works
out a three-year deficit-reduction plan with the Greek
government. She said Germany would assist Greece only after the
government in Athens agrees to take “tough” measures.  
 “Germany will help when the corresponding conditions are
fulfilled,” Merkel said.  
 Opposition lawmakers accused Merkel of playing politics,
holding up an unpopular decision to shore up support in
Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia which
holds elections on May 9. The vote will determine whether
Merkel’s coalition will keep a majority in the federal
parliament’s upper chamber, the Bundesrat.  
 ‘Everything to Do’  
 “Merkel’s delaying this vote has everything to do with the
election in North Rhine-Westphalia,” the opposition Social
Democrat general-secretary, Andrea Nahles, told reporters.  
 The German government will implement a “fast-track”
parliamentary approval process for Greek aid that may begin next
week once the IMF has finished its review, Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said after briefing lawmakers today. Approval
for credit will come in the form of a special budget law.  
 Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou issued a
statement today confirming the need to “over the next years
reduce deficits drastically, control its debt and proceed with
all the structural adjustments so that we will have a more
competitive economy.”  
 Merkel rejected calls for Greece to be ejected from the
group that shares the 16-nation currency, saying that such
speculation would roil an already unsettled market.  
 “I say very clearly no to that,” Merkel responded when
asked about a Greek ejection. “We don’t need insecurity, rather
we need clarity.”  
 IMF Talks  
 Merkel’s allies began stepping up pressure on Greece’s
government, which is holding talks with the IMF in Athens on
conditions for the aid. IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-
Kahn told the chancellor that talks over the rescue will be
completed by the beginning of May, Merkel said.  
 “We expect very concrete decisions from Greece,
sustainable decisions,” Volker Kauder, the parliamentary group
leader of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said. “This
can’t be solved with credit alone; something has to change
within Greece.”  
 Peter Matuschek, head of political research at the Berlin-
based Forsa polling company, said “it’s hard to imagine”
German lawmakers will block aid to Greece and attributed much of
the renewed pressure on Greece to politics.  
 “The government won’t be able to resist a solution” for
Greece, Matuschek said in an interview. “Some of the rhetoric
you’re hearing now is clearly related to the election campaign
in North Rhine-Westphalia.”  
 ‘Pressing Ahead’  
 Schaeuble dismissed the idea that political concerns were
at work.  
 “We’re aware of what the public thinks but we’re pressing
ahead -- it’s in Germany’s fundamental interest,” Schaeuble
said. To accelerate the approval process, Strauss-Kahn and
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet will brief
lawmakers on April 28 in Berlin, he said.  
 Both Merkel and Schaeuble tamped down calls to incorporate
Greece’s creditors in whatever rescue package emerges. Merkel
said that although she sympathized with such demands, “state
guarantees can’t be removed from the picture.” Schaeuble said
including banks would entail “unforeseeable consequences.”  
 Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou was
negotiating terms of the aid during a meeting of counterparts
from the world’s biggest nations in Washington. With Greece
facing 8.5 billion euros ($11.3 billion) of bonds maturing May
19, finance ministers yesterday sought a swift resolution of the
talks amid concern any delay may trigger a further sell-off and
spread to other markets.  
 “It is extraordinary that a euro-zone member finds itself
a mere three weeks away from a potential default, with a clear
possibility that uncertainty will only be resolved at the last
minute,” Marco Annunziata, chief economist for UniCredit Group
in London, wrote in a note to investors.
