             Running back LeGarrette Blount, who
missed most of his senior season at the University of Oregon for
punching an opposing player, signed with the Tennessee Titans.  
 Blount, who wasn’t selected during the National Football
League’s draft, initially agreed to sign with the San Francisco
49ers before changing his mind after speaking with Titans coach
Jeff Fisher, according to the Nashville Tennessean.  
 Blount, 23, rushed for 1,002 yards and 17 scores during his
junior year at Oregon. He was suspended following the Ducks’
season-opener in 2009 after punching a Boise State player
following Oregon’s loss. He was escorted from the field by
security and teammates after also confronting fans in the
stands. Blount was reinstated for the final month of the season
though played sparingly, rushing for 82 yards on 22 attempts for
the year.  
 “We talked to the kid, we talked to Tony Dungy, who
counseled the young man some, I think we spent a lot of time
talking to the coaches there,” Titans General Manager Mike
Reinfeldt told 104.5 FM in Nashville, according to ESPN. “I
think we felt that it was probably the right thing to give him
an opportunity.”
