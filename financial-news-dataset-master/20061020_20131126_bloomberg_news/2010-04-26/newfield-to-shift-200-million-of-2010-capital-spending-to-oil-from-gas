             Newfield Exploration Co. said it’s
shifting about $200 million of its 2010 capital budget to oil
projects from natural gas because of the gap between crude and
gas prices. Oil spending will increase to about $700 million,
and the total capital-spending plan will remain at $1.6 billion,
Houston-based Newfield said today in a PR Newswire statement.
