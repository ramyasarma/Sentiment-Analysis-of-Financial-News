             A looming strike at Royal Dutch
Shell Plc’s Geelong refinery threatens fuel supplies in Victoria
and Tasmania, the Australian Associated Press reported.  
 Supplies could run out by the end of the week if 20
specialist decontamination cleaners at the refinery strike, the
AAP reported, citing Jess Walsh, a Liquor Hospitality and
Miscellaneous Workers Union Victorian secretary.  
 An incoming contractor has told the workers their jobs will
be terminated and they will be re-employed at a lower rate, the
AAP said, citing Walsh. The workers decontaminate safety
clothing at the plant used by maintenance workers.
