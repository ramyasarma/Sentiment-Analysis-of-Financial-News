             Canon Inc., the world’s biggest
maker of cameras and office equipment, raised its full-year
forecasts for profit and revenue, as Asia sales drive growth.  
 Net income will probably be 240 billion yen ($2.55 billion)
in the year ending Dec. 31, Tokyo-based Canon said today. That’s
more than the 228 billion yen average of 20 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sales of compact cameras in China and single-lens-reflex
models in the U.S. are helping the maker of the EOS and
PowerShot cameras boost earnings. Worldwide sales of digital
cameras increased 43 percent in the first two months this year.
The market for office printers will probably recover throughout
2010, according to researcher IDC.  
 “China remains the biggest driver for the camera market,”
Toshiya Hari, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who rates
Canon shares “neutral,” said before the announcement. “Mid-
priced models have started to sell fairly well in the nation,
while single-lens-reflex cameras have been strong in developed
countries such as Japan and the U.S.”  
 Full-year operating profit, or sales minus the cost of
goods sold and administrative expenses, may be 360 billion yen
compared with an earlier forecast of 330 billion yen as revenue
increases to 3.75 trillion yen from 3.45 trillion yen projected
in January, Canon said.  
 Analysts estimated operating profit of 372 billion yen on
3.58 trillion yen revenue.  
 Quarterly Profit Triples  
 Canon rose 3.5 percent to close at 4,395 yen in Tokyo
trading before the earnings announcement, extending the gain
this year to 12 percent. That compares with a 5.9 percent
advance for the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average in 2010.  
 First-quarter net income more than tripled to 56.8 billion
yen in the three months ended March 31, Canon said.  
 Profit at the office-equipment division, Canon’s biggest
last year, rose 51 percent to 72 billion yen as sales gained 8
percent.  
 Worldwide printer and peripherals shipments grew 3.6 percent
to 34 million units in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from a year
earlier, the first gain since June 2008, according to IDC. That
quarter will likely turn out to be the start of a slow market
recovery through 2010, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based
researcher said March 15.  
 Profit at the camera operations, Canon’s second-biggest
division, more than doubled to 47.3 billion yen.  
 Global Camera Sales  
 “Asia is the strongest of all and we plan to add new models
there to meet demand and lead growth of our camera business,”
Masahiro Haga, a director in charge of Canon’s accounting, told
reporters in Tokyo. “Demand in the North American region has
also come back.”  
 Worldwide sales of digital cameras increased 43 percent to
198 billion yen in the first two months this year from a year
earlier, according to the Tokyo-based Camera & Imaging Products
Association. Sales of single-lens-reflex models tripled in the
U.S. while revenue from compact cameras in Asia excluding Japan
rose 50 percent during the period, the industry group said.  
 Canon said March 4 its offer for Oce NV, the world’s largest
maker of wide-format printers, is unconditional. The Japanese
maker, which in November offered to buy Venlo, Netherlands-based
Oce for about 730 million euros ($977 million) to expand its
printer operations, holds 84.65 percent of the Dutch company, it
said March 21.  
 Earlier this month, Oce reported a first-quarter net loss of
5.1 million euros compared with a net profit of 15 million euros
a year earlier, citing weak demand from its European customers.  
 Canon, which generated 78 percent of its sales outside Japan
last year, forecast the dollar will average 90 yen and the euro
125 yen in the 9 months started April 1, it said. That compares
with 90 yen and 130 yen respectively estimated in January.
