             Klabin SA, Latin America’s biggest
paper maker, jumped the most in three weeks after Itau Unibanco
Holding SA raised its rating on the company to “outperform,”
citing the prospect for price increases.  
 Klabin rose 3 percent to 5.45 reais in Sao Paulo trading at
12:10 p.m. New York time. Earlier, the shares increased as much
as 4.5 percent, the biggest intraday gain since April 7.  
 “We expect Klabin to implement paper price increases in
its main segments as demand remains strong,” wrote Marcos
Assumpcao, an analyst at Itau in Sao Paulo. Klabin has
underperformed pulp producers Fibria SA and Suzano Papel &
Celulose SA in the past year and “this trend could be reversed
as it is becoming clearer that pulp prices are reaching a
peak.”  
 Klabin may raise cardboard prices by as much as 14 percent
this quarter after increasing them as much as 8 percent in the
first quarter, Assumpcao wrote. Together with higher exports and
prices for other products, Klabin’s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization may reach 1.05 billion
reais this year, up from a previous estimate of 930 million,
Assumpcao wrote.  
 Fibria, the world’s biggest pulp producer, rose 0.2 percent
to 38.82 reais. Suzano, Brazil’s second-biggest pulp maker, fell
0.4 percent to 23.80 reais.
