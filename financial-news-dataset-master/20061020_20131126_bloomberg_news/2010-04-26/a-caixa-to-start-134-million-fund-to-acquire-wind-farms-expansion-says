             Savings bank La Caixa is starting a
100 million-euro ($134 million) fund to acquire wind farm 
assets in Spain, Expansion reported, citing people familiar 
with the situation it didn’t identify by name.  
 The fund will test investor appetite for wind farm assets 
amid regulatory uncertainty over premiums paid for renewable 
energy, the newspaper said.
