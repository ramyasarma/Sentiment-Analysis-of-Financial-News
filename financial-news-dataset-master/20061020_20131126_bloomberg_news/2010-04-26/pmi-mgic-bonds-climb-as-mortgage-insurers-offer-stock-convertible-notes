             Bonds of mortgage insurers PMI
Group Inc. and MGIC Investment Corp. rose after the companies
offered stock and convertible notes.  
 PMI’s bonds jumped after the Walnut Creek, California-based
company said yesterday it plans to sell $600 million of
convertible notes and common stock. MGIC notes reached the
highest in almost three years after the biggest U.S. mortgage
insurer sold $700 million of shares last week.  
 Mortgage insurers’ access to capital markets “increases
their chances of survival” and is a sign of investors’
increased tolerance for risk, said Jim Ryan, an insurance
analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. Foreclosures are
predicted to climb to 4.5 million this year from 2.8 million in
2009, according to RealtyTrac Inc., an Irvine, California-based
research firm.  
 “As we’ve gotten little bit away from the brink of
disaster, the risk tolerance has risen,” Ryan said in a
telephone interview. “Whether they survive or not depends on a
lot factors that are outside” the mortgage insurers’ control.  
 PMI’s 6 percent senior unsecured bonds due in 2016 rose 3
cents on the dollar to 86 cents to yield 8.9 percent as of 1:15
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s
the highest since May 8, 2008.  
 The third-largest U.S. mortgage insurer is offering $200
million of convertible notes due in 2020 and $400 million of
common stock, PMI said yesterday in a statement.  
 ‘Game Changer’  
 MGIC’s 5.375 percent senior unsecured notes jumped 4 cents
on the dollar to 91 cents to yield 7.39 percent on April 21,
Trace data show, after the Milwaukee-based company sold $700
million of shares and $300 million of 5 percent convertible
senior notes due in 2017. The senior unsecured debt traded at
its highest since July 2007.  
 “As was the case with MTG, PMI’s ability to pull off a
capital raise is a game changer for the credit,” David Havens,
managing director in credit trading at Nomura Securities
International Inc. in New York, said in a client note. “That
said, a lot of things need to break in PMI’s favor in order for
the company to succeed over the longer term.”  
 The survival of the mortgage insurers depends upon a
recovering economy, lender forgiveness and government programs
such as the Home Affordable Modification program, or HAMP, Ryan
said. HAMP is part of President Barack Obama’s effort to stem
foreclosures.  
 PMI’s first-quarter net loss widened to $157 million from
$115.3 million a year earlier, the insurer said yesterday in a
separate statement. Its policyholder position fell below the
minimum capital-adequacy requirements by an estimated $57.4
million and its risk to capital will be about 26.6 to 1 as of
March 31. As of Dec. 31, the company’s policyholders’ position
exceeded the minimum by $63.9 million and risk to capital was
22.1 to 1, according to the statement.  
 “PMI reported that it had finally breached its regulatory
minimum capital level,” Havens said. “A successful equity
offering would come in mighty handy right now.”  
 Radian Group Inc. is the second-largest U.S. mortgage
insurer.
