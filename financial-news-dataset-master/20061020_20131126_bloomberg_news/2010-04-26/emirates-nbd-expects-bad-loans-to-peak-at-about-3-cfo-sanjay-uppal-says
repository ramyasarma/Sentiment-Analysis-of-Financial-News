             Emirates NBD PJSC, the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest bank by assets, expects its non-performing
loans to peak at about 3 percent, Chief Financial Officer Sanjay
Uppal said in a conference call today.  
 Emirates NBD reported a decline in first-quarter profit
that wasn’t as steep as analysts had estimated, and said there
are early signs of an economic rebound.  
 Net income fell to 1.11 billion dirhams ($302 million), or
0.2 dirham a share, from 1.26 billion dirhams, or 0.23 dirham, a
year earlier, the Dubai-based bank said in a statement to Nasdaq
Dubai today. That beat the median estimate of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg of 711 million dirhams.  
 Emirates NBD expects loan growth of mid-single digits this
year, Uppal said.
