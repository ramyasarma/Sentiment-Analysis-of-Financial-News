             The U.S. military suspects a North
Korean torpedo was the most likely cause for the sinking of a
South Korean naval ship last month that resulted in 46 deaths,
CNN television reported.   
 The vessel was sunk by an underwater explosion and the
explosive device itself didn’t come in contact with the ship’s
hull, CNN said yesterday, citing a U.S. military official it
didn’t identify. The conclusion is in line with that of South
Korean military officials, according to the report.
