             Emerson Electric Co.’s renewed 723
million-pound ($1.12 billion) pursuit of Chloride Group Plc,
Britain’s largest maker of backup power equipment, was rejected.  
 The 275 pence-a-share proposal for London-based Chloride is
34 percent higher than the closing price on April 22, Emerson
said in a statement today. Chloride said the company has
“better prospects” alone and Emerson’s latest approach
“continues to significantly undervalue the company.”  
 Chloride rejected a 270-pence offer in 2008 as too low, it
said. Chloride’s initial lack of a response to the latest offer,
delivered on April 23, prompted St. Louis-based Emerson to
directly engage with the British company’s shareholders, Emerson
said.  
 “This is a realistic starting point, but may still not be
enough to secure Chloride,” Michael Blogg, an analyst at
Arbuthnot, wrote in a note today. “We expect Chloride’s
earnings to bounce back pretty quickly and the latest
acquisitions should also kick in.”  
 Emerson, which has less than 10 percent of the $7 billion
market for uninterruptible power supply gear, is keen to combine
with Chloride to take on larger rivals like Schneider Electric
SA and Eaton Corp., Chairman David Farr told reporters.
Chloride’s market strength in Europe will add “critical mass”
to Emerson’s operations in the U.S. and Asia.  
 Chloride rose as much as 94.9 pence, or 45 percent, in
London and traded at 299.6 pence at 10:22 a.m., valuing the
company at 783.3 million pounds. That’s the highest value since
at least 1988.
