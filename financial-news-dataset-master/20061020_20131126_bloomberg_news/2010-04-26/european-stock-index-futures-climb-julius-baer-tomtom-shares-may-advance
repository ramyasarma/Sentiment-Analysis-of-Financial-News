             European stocks rose for a second
day as higher commodity prices boosted raw-material producers
and earnings reports provided evidence the economic recovery is
strengthening.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. and Xstrata Plc increased as metals
prices rallied in London. TomTom NV soared the most since July
after Europe’s biggest maker of portable navigation devices
reported an unexpected profit. Weir Group Plc jumped to a 21-
year high as the world’s largest maker of pumps for the mining
industry increased its profit forecast.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1 percent to 270.1,
extending this year’s advance to 6.4 percent. The measure has
rallied 71 percent from a 12-year low in March 2009 amid signs
the global economy is recovering from the worst recession since
World War II.  
 “We remain bullish,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s head of
European equity strategy Mislav Matejka wrote in a report to
clients today. “The recovery will prove sustainable.” He
maintained an “overweight” stance on European stocks relative
to U.S. equities.  
 Per-share earnings at western European companies have
topped analysts’ estimates by an average of 14 percent since the
U.S. earnings season began on April 12, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 U.S. Earnings  
 In the U.S., earnings estimates for Standard & Poor’s 500
Index companies climbed 9.1 percent on average in April, twice
the gain in their prices and the largest monthly increase since
at least 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The gauge is
trading at 14.2 times forecasts for its companies’ profits,
lower than any time since 1990, except for the six months after
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed.  
 National benchmark indexes rose in all 18 western European
markets, except Greece and Portugal. The U.K’s FTSE 100 gained
0.5 percent, while Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 each
climbed 1.2 percent.  
 Greece’s ASE Index plummeted 2.9 percent to a one-year low
as the nation’s bonds tumbled, driving the premium investors
demand to hold Greek 10-year notes rather than German bunds to a
record 6 percentage points. National Bank of Greece SA, the
country’s biggest lender, sank 3.6 percent to 11.11 euros.  
 Portugal’s PSI-20 Index slumped 3.2 percent, the most in 11
weeks, as credit-default swaps on the nation’s debt jumped to an
all-time high of 318 basis points, according to CMA DataVision.  
 $60 Billion Bailout  
 Greece’s request for a $60 billion bailout doesn’t reduce
the risk of default next year and a debt restructuring will be a
“necessity” without even more aid, according to Evolution
Securities Ltd. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greece
needs to show its budget is on a “sustainable” path and a full
German agreement to a bailout may take “a few days.”  
 BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, climbed 2
percent to 2,151 pence. Xstrata gained 2.3 percent to 1,194
pence. Antofagasta Plc jumped 7.1 percent to 1,064 pence, the
most in five months. Copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc rose on
the London Metal Exchange.  
 TomTom jumped 9.8 percent to 6.57 euros, the biggest gain
since July 22. The company posted first-quarter net income of
2.9 million euros ($3.9 million), beating the average estimate
of a loss of 8.4 million euros in a survey of five analysts by
Bloomberg.  
 Weir soared 8.7 percent to 1,017 pence, the highest close
since at least 1989. The company increased its full-year profit
forecast after saying it performed better than expected in the
first quarter.  
 Cookson Climbs  
 Cookson Group Plc rallied 6.8 percent to 607 pence after
the world’s biggest maker of ceramic linings for metal smelters
forecasted a rise in first-half profit of as much as 20 percent.  
 Chloride Group Plc surged 42 percent to 297 pence after
Emerson Electric Co.’s renewed its offer for Britain’s largest
maker of backup power equipment. The 723 million-pound ($1.12
billion) bid was rejected and Chloride said the company has
“better prospects” alone and Emerson’s approach “continues to
significantly undervalue the company.”  
 “Given the strategic value of the business, combined with
the currency factors, we believe Emerson will have to raise its
proposal and would therefore continue to hold on to the
shares,” Jonathan Jackson, the head of equities at Killik & Co.
wrote in a note to clients today.  
 Air Liquide Advances  
 Air Liquide SA increased 1.7 percent to 89.86 euros. The
world’s biggest producer of industrial gases said first-quarter
sales rose 5.2 percent to 3.15 billion euros, bolstered by
demand in emerging markets and a recovery in electronics
markets. The average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 10
analysts was 3.08 billion euros in revenue.  
 Bank of Ireland Plc rallied 6.1 percent to 1.91 euros,
erasing an earlier drop. The country’s biggest bank by market
value plans to raise as much as 3.4 billion euros ($4.5 billion)
to bolster capital as real-estate losses surge.  
 “There may be some disappointment at the dilution, but it’s
well anticipated and overall the transaction terms look
attractive,” said Sebastian Orsi, an analyst at Merrion Capital
in Dublin.  
 Yara International ASA lost 5.6 percent to 211 kroner, the
biggest decline in the Stoxx 600. The world’s largest supplier
of mineral fertilizers was downgraded to “hold” fom “buy” at
Deutsche Bank AG.
