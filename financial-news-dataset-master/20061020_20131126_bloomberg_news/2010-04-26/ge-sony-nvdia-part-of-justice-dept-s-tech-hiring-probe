             The U.S. Justice Department has
questioned General Electric Co., Sony Corp. and Nvidia Corp. as
part of a probe into the technology industry’s recruiting and
hiring practices, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  
 Authorities are examining whether companies secretly agreed
to not recruit or hire each other’s employees, an antitrust
violation that could deprive workers of higher salaries, said
the person, who requested anonymity.  
 The disclosure that officials at the three companies have
been questioned indicates a wider investigation than was
previously known publicly. The Wall Street Journal has reported
that the investigation also involves Intel Corp., International
Business Machines Corp., Google Inc., Apple Inc. and
IAC/InteractiveCorp.  
 Collusion of this sort “would hurt the workers” and give
consumers “fewer choices,” said Robert Lande, a law professor
at the University of Baltimore. Besides depressing wages, such
an agreement may stifle innovation, he said.  
 The Justice Department hasn’t determined whether any
company violated the law, said the person familiar with the
matter. Investigators are still following up on leads from their
discussions with the firms and examining several time periods,
the person said.  
 Declining Comment  
 Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment.  
 Sony spokesman John Dolak, IBM spokesman Edward Barbini and
Leslie Cafferty, a spokeswoman for IAC/InterActiveCorp, didn’t
respond to requests for comment.  
 GE spokeswoman Anne Eisele, Nvidia spokesman Robert
Sherbin, Google spokesman Andrew Pederson, Apple spokesman Steve
Dowling and Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, declined to
comment.  
 The investigation expands the scrutiny of technology
companies by President Barack Obama’s administration. The makeup
of Google’s and Apple’s boards has drawn the attention of the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and the Justice Department has
urged a federal judge to revise a settlement between copyright
owners and Google over the company’s book-scanning project.  
 Technology companies often trade workers as they seek to
lure the best talent and sometimes end up in conflict. In 2005,
Microsoft Corp., the world’s largest software maker, sued after
Google lured away Kai-Fu Lee to run a development center in
China. The companies settled the suit.  
 In January 2009, Apple and IBM resolved a three-month legal
battle over the hiring of IBM executive Mark Papermaster as
Apple’s engineering chief.
