             China may use capital requirements
for developers as a policy tool to cool the property market, Ba
Shusong, deputy directory general of the State Council’s
Development Research Center, told Shanghai Securities News in an
interview.  
 The government may raise the minimum capital requirement
for housing projects to 35 percent again, after cutting it to 20
percent last year, the report cited Ba as saying.  
 China should also consider using a property tax to curb
speculation, Ba said in the interview.
