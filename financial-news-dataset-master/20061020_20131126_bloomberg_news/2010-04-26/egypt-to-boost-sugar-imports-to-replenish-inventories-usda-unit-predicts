             Egypt’s sugar imports will rise to
1.2 million metric tons this year from an estimated 978,000 tons
in 2009, according to a unit of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  
 Imports will rebound “in order to replenish stocks” after
sugar users curbed purchases last year due to high prices, the
U.S. Foreign Agriculture Service said today in a report on the
USDA Web site.
