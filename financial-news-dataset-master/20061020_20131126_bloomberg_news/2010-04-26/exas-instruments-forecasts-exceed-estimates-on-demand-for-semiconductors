             Texas Instruments Inc., the second-
largest U.S. chipmaker, predicted sales and profit that topped
analysts’ estimates, helped by demand for semiconductors used in
industrial machinery, phone networks and cars.  
 Second-quarter profit will be 56 cents to 64 cents a share
on sales of at least $3.31 billion, the Dallas-based company
said today in a statement. Analysts had predicted a profit of 53
cents a share and revenue of $3.23 billion on average, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Texas Instruments is the biggest producer of analog chips,
which go into everything from washing machines to
supercomputers, making its earnings a broad indicator of demand
for electronics. Last month, the company raised its first-
quarter projections, citing a recovery in demand from customers
that make industrial machinery.  
 “The numbers we’re going to see out of them for the rest
of the year are probably going to be pretty good,” said Doug
Freedman, an analyst at Broadpoint AmTech Inc. in San Francisco.
He has a buy rating on the shares, which he doesn’t own. After
depleting stockpiles of parts last year, electronics makers are
still struggling to get hold of enough inventory, Freedman said.  
 Texas Instruments rose 19 cents to $27.35 in late trading.
The shares, up 52 percent over the past year, advanced 49 cents
to $27.16 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.  
 ‘Very Strong Demand’  
 First-quarter profit rose to $658 million, or 52 cents a
share, from $17 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier, the company
said in the statement. Sales climbed 54 percent to $3.21
billion.  
 Analysts had estimated profit of 51 cents a share and sales
of $3.14 billion. The company had forecast profit of 48 cents to
52 cents a share on sales of $3.07 billion to $3.19 billion.  
 The company got “very strong demand” in all of its end
markets and regions, Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in
a telephone interview. Texas Instruments has improved its lead
times -- the gap between receiving an order and filling it --
without an increase in cancellations, he said. Orders continue
to exceed shipments, he said.  
 “Cancellations remain unchanged and orders picked up even
more,” March said.  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Chris Danely and other analysts had
expressed concern that electronics makers were stockpiling
supplies, inflating chip companies’ earnings. Inventory levels
for Texas Instruments and its distributors are “very lean,”
March said today.  
 Under Chief Executive Officer Rich Templeton, the company
is leaving the market for digital signal processors that manage
the radio functions in mobile phones -- an area it once
dominated. Qualcomm Inc. now leads in that field.  
 Texas Instruments is focusing instead on analog chips,
where it expects to win more orders and grow faster. The company
ranked second to Intel Corp. among U.S. chipmakers in sales last
year.
