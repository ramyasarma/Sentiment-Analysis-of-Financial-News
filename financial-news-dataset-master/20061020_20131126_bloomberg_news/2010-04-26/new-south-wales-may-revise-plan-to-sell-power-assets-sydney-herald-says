             Australia’s New South Wales state
may make changes to its power aset sale plans after the
Australian competition regulator opposed a ‘coinsurance’
arrangement that allowed power companies to share capacity
during blackouts, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The
revised plan would leave New South Wales with a “hopeless
oligopoly,” the newspaper cited Infratil Ltd., which sells
power in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, as saying in
a submission to the regulator.
