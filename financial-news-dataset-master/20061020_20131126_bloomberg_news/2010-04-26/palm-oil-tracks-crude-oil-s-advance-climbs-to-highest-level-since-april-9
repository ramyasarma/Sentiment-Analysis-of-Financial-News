             Palm oil advanced as crude oil rose
for a third day, boosting the appeal of vegetable oils used in
biofuels, and after Godrej International Ltd. director Dorab
Mistry said the tropical oil may advance in the second half.  
 Palm oil for July delivery gained as much as 1.1 percent to
2,568 ringgit ($809) a metric ton, the highest price for the
most-active contract since April 9, and traded at 2,556 ringgit
on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange by the 12:30 p.m. break.  
 “Crude palm oil looks to be tagging the rise in crude oil
today,” said Arhnue Tan, a senior analyst at ECM Libra Capital
Sdn. in Kuala Lumpur.  
 Palm oil has tracked crude oil’s weekly movements for the
past 11 weeks. Crude oil in New York for June delivery rose 0.2
percent to $85.31 a barrel at 2:28 p.m. Singapore time amid
optimism that the global economic recovery will boost demand.  
 The gains came even as data showed palm oil exports from
Malaysia, the second-biggest producer, tumbled 15 percent in the
first 25 days of April compared with the same period in March,
according to independent market surveyor Intertek.  
 A total of 947,304 tons of shipments were tracked from
April 1 to 25, down from 1.1 million tons in the same period in
March, Intertek said in an e-mailed statement in Kuala Lumpur.
Shipments to the two largest consumers dropped, with exports to
China down 12 percent to 285,707 tons, and to India and the
subcontinent down 53 percent to 124,700 tons.  
 Export Data  
 “It’s been expected to be weak for this month, especially
from those two regions,” Tan said. “For China, numbers should
normalize eventually as the current decline is because of a
stock buildup, which was reported by China last week.”  
 China’s palm oil inventories are at the highest in 1 1/2
years, with stockpiles at ports estimated at 546,000 tons, the
China National Grain & Oils Information Center said on April 15.  
 “As for India, we believe the decline could be due to
competition with soy oil as the crude palm oil-soy oil discount
has narrowed considerably,” Tan said.  
 Soybean oil in Chicago for July delivery gained as much as
0.8 percent to 40.19 cents a pound, and traded at 40 cents at
2:30 p.m. Singapore time. That put its premium over palm oil at
$78.13 a ton, the lowest for three weeks, according to Bloomberg
data. That compares with a 12-month average premium of $130.92.  
 In China, palm oil traded in Dalian rose for a second day
to gain 0.6 percent to 7,004 yuan ($1,026) a ton at the 11:30
a.m. trading break. Dalian soybean oil was little changed at
3,995 yuan a ton.  
 El Nino  
 Palm oil may advance in the second half as dry weather
caused by El Nino pares output in Malaysia and Indonesia,
according to Godrej’s Mistry. The commodity may rise as high as
3,200 ringgit a ton after June, he said in remarks prepared for
a conference in Dubai, restating a prediction made in March.  
 Imports by India, the largest importer, may drop as buyers
switch to soybean oil to profit from China’s ban on shipments of
the commodity from Argentina, the biggest global supplier.  
 Purchases may fall to 6.7 million tons in the year to Sept.
30, from 6.9 million tons the previous year, Thomas Mielke,
executive director of Oil World, said in an interview in Dubai
at the weekend. Soybean oil shipments may rise to as much as 1.5
million tons from 1.06 million tons, he said.
