             German tax revenue next year will
fall below estimates after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition
cut taxes, Handelsblatt reported, citing an expert consulted by
the government.  
 Public-sector tax revenue in 2011 will probably total 514
billion euros ($686 billion), or 6 billion euros less than
forecast a year ago by the government’s tax panel, the newspaper
cited Alfred Boss, an economist at the IfW institute in Kiel, as
saying. The panel will release new forecasts on May 6,
Handelsblatt said.
