             Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty revised his government’s forecasts for growth higher,
following a survey of private sector economists.  
 The government revised its 2010 growth forecast to 3.1
percent, from 2.6 percent in a budget presented last month,
implying output this year that is C$18 billion ($18 billion)
more than projected, according to a statement released by the
finance department. The government said its forecasts beyond
2010 were “broadly” the same.  
 The changes suggest Flaherty will have more scope to reduce
record deficits. The government estimated in its budget last
month that a 1 percentage point drop in growth would reduce its
budget balance by C$10.9 billion over a three year period.  
 “It’s probably not going to materially change the base
forecast for the fiscal numbers,” said Craig Wright, chief
economist with Royal Bank of Canada. “But what it should do is
reduce some of the concerns that they won’t be able to achieve
it because the economic environment is too weak.”  
 The department also revised its gross domestic product
inflation forecast, increasing it to 2.8 percent for 2010 from
the 2.2 percent it had last month. According to the budget, a 1
percentage point drop in GDP inflation would cost the government
C$4.7 billion.  
 The government, which bases its economic outlook on a
survey of private-sector forecasters including economists from
Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
will update its fiscal forecasts in the “fall,” according to
the statement.  
 The government last month projected a record deficit of
C$53.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended March 31, and
C$49.2 billion in the current year.
