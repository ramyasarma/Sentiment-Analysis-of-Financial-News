             Brocade Communications Systems
Inc., the maker of switches for data-storage networks, sued
rival A10 Networks Inc. alleging infringement of seven U.S.
patents.  
 Brocade, based in San Jose, California, asked for a jury
trial, unspecified damages and an order to stop A10 from selling
infringing products in the U.S., in a complaint filed April 23
in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  
 A10, with some employees who formerly worked for Brocade’s
Foundry Networks unit, “has competed directly with the products
and product lines of Brocade and Foundry” and “willfully,
wantonly and deliberately” infringed, according to the
complaint.  
 Brocade, with $1.95 billion in sales last fiscal year, may
be an attractive takeover target for computer maker Dell Inc.,
according to a recent report from Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc.  
 Closely held A10, also based in San Jose, was founded in
2004 and has offices in the U.S., U.K., France, the Netherlands,
Brazil, Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan, according to its Web
site.  
 A10 spokeswoman Kelly LeBlanc didn’t immediately reply to 
phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  
 The patents cover methods for network route redundancy,
server load-balancing and network address translation, according
to court papers. Brocade contends A10 is infringing with its AX
Series data-traffic manager.  
 Brocade was unchanged at $6.53 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading.  
 The case is Brocade Communications v. A10 Networks,
10CV332, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
