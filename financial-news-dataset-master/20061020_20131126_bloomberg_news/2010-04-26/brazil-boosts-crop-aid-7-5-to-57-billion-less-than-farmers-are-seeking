             Brazil’s government plans to boost
farm lending for next year’s crop by about 7.5 percent to almost
100 billion reais ($57.3 billion), less than the amount sought
by growers seeking protection against price declines.  
 The financing will be available to commercial farmers, who
start planting in September, Agriculture Minister Wagner Rossi
said in a statement today. Last year, the government offered 93
billion reais in farm loans, the ministry said.  
 The government-aid package is less than Brazilian farmers
are seeking after debt surged and a global credit crunch pared
access to financing, according to Rosemeire Santos, a director
at the National Agriculture Confederation. Farmers want 146
billion reais of credit as higher production of soybeans, corn
and other crops increase the need of stockpiling to avert price
drops, she said today in an interview in Brasilia.  
 The government is the main backer of crop financing in
Brazil, the world’s largest producer of sugar, coffee and
oranges. Brazil is the second-largest producer of soybeans
