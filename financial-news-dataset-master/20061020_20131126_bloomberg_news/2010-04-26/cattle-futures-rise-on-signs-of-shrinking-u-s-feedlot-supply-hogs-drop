             Cattle rose for the fourth time in
five sessions after a report showed that U.S. feedlots bought
fewer animals than expected in March, signaling reduced supplies
of fattened cattle in the future. Hogs declined.  
 Feedlots purchased 1.857 million young cattle in March, up
2.7 percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture reported April 23 after trading closed in Chicago.
Analysts in a Bloomberg News survey were expecting a 6.3 percent
jump. Wholesale choice beef climbed to $1.7034 a pound at
midday, the highest since July 2008, USDA data show.  
 “The supply fundamentals have been phenomenally friendly,
and we’ve done better than expected in so many instances on the
demand side,” said David Kruse, a commodity trading adviser at
CommStock Investments Inc. in Royal, Iowa. “Packers continue to
push beef prices higher, trying to find a level where retailers
will say no, but evidently they haven’t found it yet.”  
 Cattle futures for June delivery rose 0.675 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 95.5 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are up 16 percent in the past year. Feeder-
cattle futures for August settlement gained 1.375 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $1.1695 a pound.  
 The overall feedlot herd on April 1 was 3.5 percent smaller
than a year earlier at 10.769 million head, the fewest for the
date since 2004, the USDA report showed.  
 Lighter Cattle  
 In addition, fewer heavy-weight cattle have been available
to feedlots, because harsh winter weather has curbed weight
gains, Kruse said. Rising cattle prices also spurred feedlots to
sell animals early instead of spending more time fattening them,
he said. Lighter cattle yield less beef.  
 Feedlots bought 1.087 million head of cattle weighing 700
pounds or more in March, 6.5 percent fewer than during the same
month last year, according the USDA. In the first four days of
last week, steer carcasses weighed 849 pounds on average, 0.5
percent less than the same period in 2009.  
 “The kill has been running ahead of year-ago levels, even
though we have fewer cattle on feed,” Kruse said. “You can
only do that for a while, before pretty soon you use up your
front-end supply.”  
 Hog futures for June settlement declined 0.9 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 84.275 cents a pound, after opening higher. The
most-active contract has gained 18 percent in the past year, as
extended losses spurred producers to cut herds.  
 Wholesale pork fell 0.4 percent to 90.3 cents a pound on
April 23, snapping a 16-session rally. The price reached 90.68
cents on April 22, the highest level since August 2008. High
prices may curb consumer demand for pork, Kruse said.
