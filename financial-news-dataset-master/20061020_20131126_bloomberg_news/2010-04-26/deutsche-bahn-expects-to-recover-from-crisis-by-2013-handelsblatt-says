             Deutsche Bahn AG Chief Executive
Officer Ruediger Grube expects the company to recover from the
effects of the economic crisis by 2013, as much as two years
earlier than previously forecast, Handelsblatt reported, citing
an interview.  
 Sales growth of about 8 percent in the first quarter,
driven by the transport and logistics unit, allowed for the more
optimistic forecast, Grube was cited as saying.
