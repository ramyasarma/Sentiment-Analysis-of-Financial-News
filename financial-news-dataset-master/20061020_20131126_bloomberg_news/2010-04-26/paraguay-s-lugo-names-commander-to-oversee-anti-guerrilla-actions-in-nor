             Paraguay President Fernando Lugo
named Brigadier General Ramon Bartolome Pineda to lead efforts
to subdue the Paraguayan People’s Army, a rebel group the
government blames for assassinations of police and civilians.  
 Pineda will oversee a group of troops and police officers
that has 30 days to pursue the guerrillas under a law passed
April 24 that makes it easier to arrest and detain suspected
rebels in five northern provinces, according to the presidential
website.
