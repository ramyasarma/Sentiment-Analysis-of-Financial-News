             U.K. Coal Plc, the nation’s biggest
producer of the fuel, posted a wider full-year loss as
production and prices declined.  
 The net loss was 127.5 million pounds ($197.1 million), or
72.9 pence a share, compared with a loss of 15.7 million pounds,
or 10 pence, a year earlier, the Doncaster-based company said in
a statement. Production fell to 7 million metric tons from 7.9
million tons and prices declined 2.6 percent. Sales dropped to
316 million pounds from 392.5 million pounds.  
 The company’s property assets were valued at 394 million
pounds at the end of last year, from 422 million pounds a year
earlier. Coal stockpiles held by U.K. generators rose to records
in the five consecutive months to September, according to
government data.  
 U.K. Coal responded to bigger stockpiles at generators by
delaying the opening of a surface mine in Durham, northern
England, that was scheduled for July, Chief Executive Officer
Jon Lloyd said by phone today.  
 Hargreaves Services Plc said its merger talks with U.K.
Coal, announced in March, were delayed and remain “very
preliminary.”  
 U.K. Coal closed down 1.5 pence, or 2.7 percent, at 55
pence in London. The stock dropped 52 percent in the last 12
months, valuing the company at 164.6 million pounds.
