             Aircraft cockpit distractions from
mobile devices are unacceptable and U.S. carriers must increase
awareness of risks to safety after a Delta Air Lines Inc. flight
overshot its destination, regulators said.  
 The Federal Aviation Administration urged carriers to
stress in crew training that activities unrelated to a flight
may create a safety risk, according to a statement today. Pilots
at Delta’s Northwest unit flew 150 miles past Minneapolis in
October when they were using laptop computers and lost track of
their course, the agency said.  
 “Allowing distractions is unacceptable,” Administrator
Randy Babbitt said in the statement.  
 Aviation regulators are stepping up efforts on safety after
unnecessary pilot conversations were found to contribute to a
Pinnacle Airlines Corp. crash near Buffalo, New York, last year,
killing 50. The National Transportation Safety Board plans a
three-day hearing next month on “professionalism in aviation.”  
 The FAA, in a notice to carriers, cites recent incidents
including a pilot texting after the aircraft pushed back from
the gate and a crew member’s mobile phone that rang as the plane
rolled down the runway during takeoff.
