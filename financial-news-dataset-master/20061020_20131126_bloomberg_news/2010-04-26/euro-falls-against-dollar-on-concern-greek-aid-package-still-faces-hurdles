             The euro dropped against all of its
major counterparts on concern the European Union-led 45 billion
euro ($60 billion) aid package for Greece won’t prevent the
deficit crisis from spreading.  
 Europe’s common currency fell to its lowest level since
January versus the pound as Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel
said she won’t release funds for Greece until the nation has a
“sustainable” plan to cut its deficit. The euro pared its loss
against the dollar as Bundesbank President Axel Weber told CNBC
that the euro doesn’t have a “credibility” issue.  
 “Every time a resolution is announced, Germany comes out
and says wait a minute, it’s not a done deal,” said Yu-Dee
Chang, who oversees $160 million in assets as chief executive
officer of ACE Investment Strategists LLC in McLean, Virginia.
“That adds to uncertainty for the euro.”  
 The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.3365 at 4:02 p.m. in New
York, from $1.3384 on April 23. The euro traded at 125.65 yen,
compared with 125.73. The dollar was at 94.04 yen, compared with
93.97, after reaching 94.36, the highest level since April 6.  
 Greece’s bonds tumbled today, with the premium investors
demand to hold the nation’s 2-year notes rather than comparable
German debt increasing to more than 12 percentage points. The
difference in yield between Portugal’s 2-year notes and German
securities widened to 3.1 percentage points.  
 ‘Tough’ Measures  
 Speaking in Berlin to reporters, Merkel said there will be
no decision on aid for Greece until the International Monetary
Fund works out a plan of cuts with the government in Athens. She
said Germany will assist Greece only after it agrees to take
“tough” measures for the next several years.  
 Weber, a member of the European Central Bank’s Governing
Council, told CNBC it’s “totally unrealistic” to consider that
Greece will leave the euro area.  
 The euro fell as much as 1.1 percent to 86.04 British
pence, the lowest level since Jan. 28, in the biggest intraday
loss since March 30. The pound gained 0.5 percent to $1.5456.  
 The dollar touched its strongest level in almost three
weeks versus the yen on speculation the Federal Reserve is
moving closer to withdrawing stimulus as the U.S. economic
recovery gathers momentum.  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange show a 70 percent
chance the Fed will raise its benchmark rate by at least a
quarter-percentage point by its December meeting, compared with
60 percent odds a week ago.  
 UBS’s View  
 The euro may weaken to less than $1.30 this year should the
Fed start raising interest rates before policy makers in Europe,
according to UBS AG.  
 “If the Fed does hike before the European Central Bank and
the banks of Japan and England, the dollar will become a growth
currency again rather than a safe haven,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin,
chief currency strategist in Singapore, wrote in a report
received yesterday. “This suggests euro-dollar and pound-dollar
remain at risk in 2010 of falling well below our three-month
targets of $1.30 and $1.48, respectively.”  
 All of the 99 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predict
the Federal Open Market Committee will hold its target rate at a
range of zero to 0.25 percent on April 28.  
 South Africa’s rand rose 1 percent to 12.79 yen and New
Zealand’s dollar advanced 0.8 percent to 67.94 yen on
speculation investors will increase carry trades, in which they
buy higher-yielding assets with amounts borrowed in nations with
low interest rates. Japan’s target rate of 0.1 percent has made
the yen popular for funding such transactions.  
 Carry-Trade Profit  
 Foreign-exchange profits from carry trades are disappearing
as differences in central bank interest rates fail to increase
fast enough to compensate for swings in currency rates. Royal
Bank of Scotland Plc’s index tracking the strategy rose 0.57
percent in the first quarter, the smallest amount in a year, and
down from 9.8 percent in all of 2009.  
 South Korea’s won strengthened to a 19-month high versus
the dollar before a report forecast to show the nation’s economy
expanded 7.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,
the most since the fourth quarter of 2002.  
 The won appreciated 0.5 percent to 1,103.80 per dollar,
after earlier touching 1,102.85, its strongest level since
September 2008. The currency has gained 5.5 percent this year.  
 Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards climbed 0.1
percent to 6.6065 per dollar, reflecting speculation that
China’s currency will strengthen 3.3 percent. The government
will allow it to gain this year, according to all 19 analysts in
a Bloomberg News survey this month.  
 A 5 percent revaluation of the yuan would narrow the U.S.
trade deficit with China by $61 billion, according to a study by
the economist Joseph Francois of Johannes Kepler University in
Linz, Austria.  
 Companies including Yum! Brands Inc., the Louisville,
Kentucky-based owner of Pizza Hut, and Coca-Cola Co., the
world’s largest soft-drink maker, are expanding in China to
attract new customers.
