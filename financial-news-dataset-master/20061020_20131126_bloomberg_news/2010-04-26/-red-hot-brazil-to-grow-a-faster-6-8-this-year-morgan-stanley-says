             Morgan Stanley said Brazil’s
economy and inflation will accelerate faster this year than it
previously expected as recent data show the economy is “red
hot” and “firing on all cylinders.”  
 Morgan Stanley, in a report written by economist Marcelo
Carvalho, raised its forecast for 2010 economic growth to 6.8
percent from a 5.8 percent forecast made in March. It was the
second revision this year. That would be the strongest annual
pace in more than 20 years, Carvalho wrote.  
 “We are concerned the economy might be overheating
already, given broadening signs of domestic demand strength,
shrinking slack and deteriorating inflation dynamics,” Carvalho
wrote.  
 With inflationary pressures building, and little hope for
fiscal tightening before October elections, the central bank
will be expected “to do the bulk of the heavy lifting in
slowing down the economy,” Carvalho wrote.  
 Inflation will accelerate to 5.8 percent from a previous
estimate of 5 percent, forcing the central bank to raise
interest rates 400 basis points during 2010 and 2011, the report
said. Previously, Morgan Stanley forecast a 325-basis-point
tightening cycle.  
 A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.  
 “We suspect a booming economy would eventually force the
Copom to do more than it may have envisioned initially,”
Carvalho wrote, referring to the central bank’s monetary policy
committee.  
 Recession Call  
 Carvalho’s forecast for a 4.5 percent contraction in 2009
led analysts who were predicting a less pronounced recession in
Latin America’s biggest economy during the global financial
crisis.  
 In June he revised that call, saying the recession would be
shorter and the economy would contract a smaller 1 percent as
resilient consumer spending and capital flows offset a plunge in
exports and investments.  
 Brazil’s $1.8 trillion economy shrank 0.2 percent last
year, its first negative annual result since a 0.47 percent
contraction in 1992.  
 Carvalho said the real should strengthen to 1.65 per U.S.
dollar this year, compared with a previous forecast of 1.70, as
a result of faster growth and higher interest rates.  
 Brazil’s gross domestic product expanded 7.5 percent in
1986, according to the national statistics agency in Rio de
Janeiro. The best result since then was a 6.1 percent increase
in 2007.
