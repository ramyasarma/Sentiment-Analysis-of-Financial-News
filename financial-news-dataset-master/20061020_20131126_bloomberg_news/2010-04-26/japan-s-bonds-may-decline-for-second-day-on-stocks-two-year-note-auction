             Japan’s 10-year yields approached
the lowest level since March as declines in Asian stocks
boosted demand for the relative safety of government debt.  
 Bonds headed for their best month since November on
speculation money managers bought debt to match an index used
to gauge performance. A Ministry of Finance sale of 2.6
trillion yen ($27.7 billion) in two-year notes today drew the
highest demand since August 2007. Gains in bonds were limited
before Japan’s financial markets close this week before the
three-day “Golden Week” holidays starting May 3.  
 “Bonds are being bought because of the weakness in
stocks,” said Takafumi Yamawaki, a senior strategist in Tokyo
at BNP Paribas Securities Japan Ltd., a unit of France’s
largest bank. “It’s hard to hold aggressive positions before
Golden Week amid concerns over Greece.”  
 The yield on the 1.4 percent security due March 2020 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.31 percent at
3:01 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The price rose 0.087 yen to
100.786 yen. Ten-year yields reached 1.305 percent on April 19,
the lowest since March 11.  
 Ten-year bond futures for June delivery gained 0.22 to
139.40 as of the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  
 Two-year yields were unchanged at 0.16 percent today.
Today’s sale drew bids worth 4.73 times the amount on offer,
the highest bid-to-cover ratio since August 2007.  
 The lowest price at the bond offering was 0.005 yen below
the average, compared with 0.007 at the March 25 sale. The so-
called tail is the gap between the lowest and the average price.
The shorter the tail, the more bids are clustered around the
average price.  
 Month-End Demand  
 Nomura Securities Co. increased the average duration of
its Bond Performance Index by 0.06 year to 6.6 years for next
month, according to its Web site. Money managers including the
Government Pension Investment Fund, which runs the world’s
largest pool of retirement wealth, use indexes such as Nomura’s
to help decide holdings. Duration is a gauge of how much a
change in yield affects a bond’s price.  
 The nation’s top life insurers said they plan to boost
domestic bond holdings to secure stable returns and to meet
more stringent capital requirements.  
 Japanese government bonds handed investors a return of 0.6
percent this month, heading for the largest gain since a 0.8
percent climb in November, according to indexes compiled by
Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.  
 Advances in bonds were tempered by speculation a
government report on April 30 will add to signs the economy is
recovering. Industrial production rose 0.8 percent in March,
after dropping 0.7 percent the previous month, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Ten-year yields are likely to climb to 1.43 percent by the
end of December, according to a weighted Bloomberg survey of
economists and estimates.
