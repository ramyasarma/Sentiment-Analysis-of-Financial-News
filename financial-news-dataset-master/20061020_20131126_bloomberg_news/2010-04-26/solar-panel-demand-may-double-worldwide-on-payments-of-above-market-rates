             Global demand for solar panels may
double this year as Germany and other European countries offer
guaranteed, above-market rates for the power produced.  
 Solar-panel installations will probably rise to between
11.5 gigawatts and 14.8 gigawatts this year from 7.3 gigawatts
in 2009, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in its photovoltaic
industry outlook.  
 State support in most European countries drives investment
in photovoltaic equipment, NEF said. In Italy, the prices paid
for solar power are as high as 43 euro cents (57 U.S. cents) for
each kilowatt-hour generated. That’s about six times the
wholesale rate earned by fossil-fuel-burning plants.  
 Operators of solar power stations in France, the U.K. and
the Czech Republic are paid similar rates. Spain and Germany,
the biggest solar equipment market, are reducing rates.
