             The Wall Street Journal’s
circulation rose in the months preceding today’s introduction of
a local section aimed at luring readers and advertisers from the
New York Times.  
 News Corp.’s Journal boosted average daily circulation by
0.5 percent to 2.09 million in the six months through March,
including subscribers to its for-pay Web site, according to
Audit Bureau of Circulations data released today. The New York
Times fell 8.5 percent to 951,063, compared with a year earlier,
ABC said.  
 The Wall Street Journal began distributing a stand-alone
“Greater New York” section, featuring articles of particular
interest to New York metropolitan readers. Executives from the
newspaper said today that they hope to attract readers from the
New York Times and other area newspapers.  
 “There’s obviously an upside to entering the New York
Times’s turf,” Robert Thomson, the Wall Street Journal’s
managing editor, said at a presentation in New York. “If you
really, really must read the New York Times, then read it on the
Web for free and buy the Wall Street Journal.”  
 Diane McNulty, a Times spokeswoman, attributed the lost
print readership to a focus on “quality circulation and high
retention rates,” saying the newspaper has kept most readers
who have subscribed for two years or more. In an e-mail to
employees today, New York Times Co. Chief Executive Officer
Janet Robinson and Chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said that
“readers and advertisers are very loyal.”  
 The Journal “will soon discover the intensity of that
dedication,” they wrote.  
 270,000 Copies  
 Les Hinton, chief executive officer of Wall Street Journal
parent and News Corp. unit Dow Jones, said in an interview he
planned to print about 270,000 copies of the “Greater New
York” section daily. It will be distributed six days a week to
metropolitan-area subscribers at no additional charge, he said.  
 He denied reports and comments, including from New York
Times President Scott Heekin-Canedy on April 23, that the
Journal significantly reduced advertising rates to fill its New
York edition.  
 In some cases, the newspaper has bundled sales of its ad
pages with those of the New York Post, a News Corp. publication,
Michael Rooney, the Journal’s chief revenue officer, said in an
interview. “The New York section allows us to go after local
advertising that we wouldn’t get historically,” he said.  
 Industrywide circulation fell 8.7 percent in the March
period, after declining 11 percent in the six months through
September, according to ABC.  
 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Rounding out the top five publications by average daily
circulation, Gannett Co.’s USA Today lost 14 percent to 1.83
million and Tribune Co.’s Los Angeles Times posted a 15 percent
drop to 616,606, ABC data show. Washington Post Co.’s namesake
newspaper declined 13 percent to 578,482.  
 Hearst Corp.’s San Francisco Chronicle had the largest
decline among the top 25 newspapers by circulation, reporting a
23 percent drop. Some newspapers didn’t have comparable year-
earlier figures, because they had changes in accounting or
distribution, ABC said.  
 News Corp., based in New York, added 12 cents, or less than
1 percent, to $16.24 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. Times Co., based in New York, lost 34 cents, or
2.9 percent, to $11.27 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
