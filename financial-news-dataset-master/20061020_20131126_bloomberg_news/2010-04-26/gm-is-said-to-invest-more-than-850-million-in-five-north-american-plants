             General Motors Co. plans to
announce tomorrow that it will invest more than $850 million to
upgrade five North American factories, three people familiar
with the matter said.  
 The spending on plants that make engines, transmissions and
related parts will preserve 1,600 jobs, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public
yet. Kim Carpenter, a spokeswoman at Detroit-based GM, said the
company is making announcements at several facilities. She
declined to give details.  
 “There is no doubt that a major differentiator going
forward will be powertrain technology,” said Michael Robinet,
vice president at research firm CSM Worldwide in Northville,
Michigan. “Heavy investment and improved fuel economy will be
on every company’s agenda.”  
 GM, the largest U.S. automaker, is boosting its spending on
more fuel-efficient engines as governments push for reduced
pollutant emissions and as rising fuel prices spur consumer
demand for vehicle with better gasoline mileage.  
 The investments will be at facilities in Tonawanda, New
York; Bay City, Michigan; Bedford, Indiana; Defiance, Ohio; and
St. Catharines, Ontario, the people said. The largest amount is
slated to go to the Tonawanda plant, they said.  
 Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre is trying to return GM
to profitability as early as this year, a step the company has
said is needed before it can make an initial public offering of
shares. The U.S. government owns a 61 percent stake in GM after
aiding the automaker’s July 2009 exit from bankruptcy.
