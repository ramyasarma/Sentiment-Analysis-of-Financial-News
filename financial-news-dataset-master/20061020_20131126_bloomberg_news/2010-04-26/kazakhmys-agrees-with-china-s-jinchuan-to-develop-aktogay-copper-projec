             Kazakhmys Plc, Kazakhstan’s biggest
copper mining company, agreed to sell almost half of its Aktogay
project, costing about $1.5-$2 billion, to Jinchuan Group Ltd.
and jointly develop the site to feed Chinese demand.  
 Jinchuan, a copper and nickel producer, will pay $120
million in cash for 49 percent, Kazakhmys said in a statement
today. Aktogay will produce an annual 100,000 metric tons of
copper in concentrate, or 30 percent of Kazakhmys’s output now.  
 Kazakhmys, which sells most of its copper to China and
Europe, has already raised $2.7 billion mainly for the Aktogay
and Bozshakol projects. The company plans to bring in customers
and mining companies as partners for Aktogay to raise $2 billion
this year, Chief Executive Officer Oleg Novachuk said March 17.
Bozshakol will also produce about 100,000 tons a year.  
 Jinchuan and Kazakhmys will begin a yearlong feasibility
study into the Aktogay project after setting up the venture and
develop the mine over the following three years, Kazakhmys said.  
 The company’s shares gained 39 pence, or 2.7 percent, to
1,469 pence by 9:20 a.m. in London trading.
