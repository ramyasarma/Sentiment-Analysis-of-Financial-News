             Standard Chartered Plc’s
Ghanaian unit said first-quarter profit more than doubled
as it earned more from lending.  
 Net income rose to 22.2 million cedis ($15.7
million) for the three months to March 31, from 10.1
million cedis a year earlier, Accra-based Standard
Chartered Bank Ghana Ltd. said in a statement published on
the Web site of the Ghana Stock Exchange today.  
 Net interest income, the money the bank earned from
lending, rose 50 percent to 36.9 million cedis, the bank
said in the statement.
