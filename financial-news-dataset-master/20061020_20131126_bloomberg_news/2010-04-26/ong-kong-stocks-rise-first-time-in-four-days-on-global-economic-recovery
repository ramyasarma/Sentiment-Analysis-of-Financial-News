             Hong Kong stocks rose, driving the
Hang Seng Index up the most in almost three weeks, as surging
U.S. home sales fueled confidence in the global recovery.  
 Foxconn International Holdings Ltd., which makes a quarter
of its revenue in America, advanced 2.8 percent after U.S. new-
home sales rose the most in 47 years. Li & Fung Ltd., a trading
company that supplies U.S.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., gained 2
percent. Cnooc Ltd., China’s No. 1 offshore oil explorer, gained
3 percent after oil prices climbed. Henderson Land Development
Co. jumped 4.3 percent, leading property companies higher.  
 The Hang Seng Index gained 1.6 percent to 21,587.06 as of
the close of trading, the biggest climb since April 7. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the so-called H
shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies, advanced 1.8
percent to 12,380.71.
    “The economic data has certainly outperformed a lot of some
people’s very skeptical expectations,” said Tim Leung, who
helps manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong
Kong. “There are good statistics coming out of the U.S. in
terms of economic recovery. We are cautiously optimistic.”  
 Shares on the Hang Seng Index are priced at an average 14.3
times estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16 when the
index closed at its highest level for 2009, according to
Bloomberg data. Concern budget deficits in Europe may derail the
global recovery and speculation China’s government will tighten
money supply have contributed to a 5.9 percent drop in the Hang
Seng from its November high.  
 U.S. Home Sales  
 Foxconn, the world’s biggest contract maker of mobile-
phones, rose 2.8 percent to HK$7.37. Li & Fung, which makes 66
percent of its revenue in the U.S., advanced 2 percent to
HK$38.95.  
 A 27 percent gain in March new-home sales was the biggest
since 1963, a government report showed yesterday. Orders for
most durable goods climbed 2.8 percent, a separate report said.
Figures from the National Association of Realtors on April 5
showed the index of purchase agreements, or pending home sales,
rose 8.2 percent, the largest gain since October 2001.  
 While the Group of 20 finance chiefs said after meeting in
Washington on April 23 that the global recovery has “progressed
better than previously anticipated,” Chinese officials at the
weekend pledged to extend their “proactive” fiscal measures
and maintain a “relatively easy” monetary policy, saying the
global economic recovery remains tentative.  
 Cnooc increased 3 percent to HK$13.98. China Oilfield
Services Ltd. jumped 4.3 percent to HK$11.12. PetroChina Co.
gained 1.8 percent to HK$9.23.  
 Oil, Shipping  
 Oil producers gained as crude oil advanced for a fifth day
on speculation demand will increase as the world economy
recovers from recession. Futures in New York rose as much as 0.6
percent to $85.63 a barrel in after-hours trading.  
 China Cosco Holdings Co., Asia’s biggest shipping company
by market value, advanced 2 percent to HK$10.22. China Shipping
Container Lines Co., the nation’s second-biggest cargo-box
carrier, increased 2.2 percent to HK$3.25. Orient Overseas
International Ltd., Hong Kong’s largest container line, climbed
1.5 percent to HK$61.50.  
 The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of shipping costs for
commodities, gained 0.2 percent to 3,013 on April 23. Also,
China Cosco Holdings Executive Vice President Sun Jiakang said
container lines will win a targeted $800 per 40-foot box rates
increase in Asia-U.S. rates this year because of rebounding
trade.  
 Metal Prices  
 Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd., also known as Chalco,
climbed 1.6 percent to HK$8.13. Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s
largest gold producer, rose 0.8 percent to HK$6.28.  
 A gauge of six metals, including copper and aluminum, on
the London Metal Exchange rose 0.5 percent on April 23.  
 Henderson Land Development, the developer controlled by
billionaire Lee Shau-kee, jumped 4.3 percent to HK$52.55. Hang
Lung Properties Ltd. increased 4 percent to HK$30.00. Sino Land
Co. advanced 3.1 percent to HK$14.62.  
 The Hang Seng Property Index increased 2 percent, the most
of four industry groups in the benchmark index, even as China’s
government on April 24 moved to tighten real-estate financing by
requiring developers to submit fund-raising plans for review.  
 “In the long term, it’ll be a positive move to manage the
market in a healthy manner,” IG Investment’s Leung said. “But
in the near term, momentum is going to slow down.”  
 Property Index  
 The property index fell 6.1 percent last week, the most
since the week ended August 7. Its 14-day relative strength
index sank to 33.28 on April 23, close to the 30 level some
traders use as a signal to buy. It climbed to 40.75 today.  
 Swire Pacific Ltd., the Hong Kong company with businesses
ranging from soft drinks to airlines, gained 2 percent to
HK$92.40. Swire Properties Ltd., a unit of Swire Pacific, plans
to raise as much as HK$20.8 billion ($2.7 billion) in an initial
public offering, said two people with knowledge of the plan.  
 Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., a Chinese energy company, jumped
7.2 percent to HK$19.42, leading coal producers higher.  
 The company’s first-quarter net income surged to 2.1
billion yuan ($307.8 million) as the Chinese economy rebounded,
spurring demand for coal, Yanzhou Coal said on April 23. Demand
for coal will increase in 2010 as China’s economy strengthens
further, the company said in its annual earnings statement.  
 China Shenhua Energy Co., the nation’s largest coal
producer, advanced 2.8 percent to HK$35.40. China Coal Energy Co.
rose 2.9 percent to HK$12.18.  
 Futures on the Hang Seng Index gained 1.2 percent to 21,506.
Just one company fell on the 43-member gauge, while one declined.
