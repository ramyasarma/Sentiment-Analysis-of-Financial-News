             China’s exports will be high at the
start of this year and low towards the end of 2010, Vice
Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan said in a statement posted today
to the ministry’s Web site.  
 Insufficient overseas demand continues to be prominent,
with the profits of Chinese exporters likely to narrow, Zhong
said in the statement. Trade disputes are intensifying, he said,
adding that the Ministry of Commerce will work to ensure stable
2010 trade growth and keep trade policies basically stable.  
 China should create loose and accomadative policies, Zhong
said in the statement. The ministry will also boost support for
small and medium-sized Chinese exporters, he said.
