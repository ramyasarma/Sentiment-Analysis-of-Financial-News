             China’s Internet service providers
and telecommunications operators may be required to help the
police in investigations of possible leaks of state secrets,
China Daily reported today, citing a draft law in review by the
National people’s Congress Standing Committee.  
 The draft law requires telecommunications companies to
report and delete information about state secrets, according to
the English-language report. A state secret is defined as
information that, if released, could harm the nation’s security
and interests, the newspaper said, citing the draft.
