             Philippine inflation may accelerate
to the fastest pace in a year this month as oil and power costs
rise, the central bank said today.  
 Consumer prices may climb in a range of 3.9 percent to 4.8
percent in April from a year earlier, Governor Amando Tetangco
said in a mobile phone message. The top end of the estimate
would be the biggest increase since April 2009. The inflation
rate rose to a three-month high of 4.4 percent in March.  
 Lower rice prices and a stronger peso “would tend to
moderate inflation,” Tetangco said. The estimate for April’s
price gains “would allow inflation to settle within the 2010
target range” of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent, he said.  
 Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas last week raised its inflation
forecast for this year to an average of 5.1 percent, saying the
“balance of risk” to prices is “tilted” to the upside. It
pared a lending program for banks even as the benchmark
overnight rate was kept at a record-low 4 percent at its April
22 meeting.  
 The next rate meeting will be in June, after the nation
elects a successor to President Gloria Arroyo on May 10. The
government will report April inflation on May 5.  
 Benchmark four-year bond yields climbed a fourth day,
rising almost three basis points to 5.855 percent, a five-week
high. The peso traded at a 20-month high today.
