             Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,
India’s largest drugmaker by market value, declined the most in
more than eight months in Mumbai trading after a U.S. federal
jury ruled that Pfizer Inc. and Altana AG have valid patents for
the heartburn drug Protonix.  
 Sun fell 4.2 percent, headed for the biggest drop since
July 29, to 1,612.90 rupees as of 10:42 a.m. local time. India’s
benchmark Sensitive Index gained 0.6 percent.  
 A federal jury in Newark, New Jersey, on April 23 rejected
arguments by Sun and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. that
the patent covered an obvious variation of earlier patented
compounds in the same family as Protonix. Pfizer can now ask U.S.
District Judge Jose Linares to order Teva and Mumbai-based Sun
to stop selling the drug until the patent expires in January.  
 A second trial would be held to determine what New York-
based Pfizer should be paid for profit lost since Sun and Teva,
of Petach Tikva, Israel, began selling cheaper versions of the
heartburn medication two years ago.  
 Teva dropped 2.5 percent in Tel Aviv trading on April 25,
the most since Jan. 24, after the jury decision.  
 Protonix sales reached $1.9 billion in 2007, and then fell
58 percent in 2008, after Teva began selling its generic version.
Sun entered the market in January 2008, a month after Teva.  
 Pfizer, the world’s biggest drugmaker, acquired Protonix
last year as part of its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth.
