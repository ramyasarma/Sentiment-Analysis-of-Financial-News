             U.S. farmers accelerated planting
of the corn crop last week ahead of weekend rain, government
data show. Winter-wheat conditions held steady.  
 About 50 percent of the corn crop was seeded as of
yesterday, compared with 19 percent a week earlier and 20
percent a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture said today
in a report. The average for the previous five years was 22
percent. An estimated 7 percent of the plants had emerged from
the ground, compared with the five-year average of 5 percent,
the USDA said.  
 “It’s the fastest pace on record and now we’ll see if we
can get the rest of the crop planted as quickly,” said Dan
Cekander, the director of grain research for Newedge USA LLC in
Chicago. “It’s warm and that means the crop should come up out
the ground quickly,” increasing yield potential, he said.  
 Corn futures for July delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.595 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Last
week, the price fell 3.5 percent on speculation that U.S.
farmers were seeding the crop at a record pace.  
 Planting of sorghum was 25 percent completed as of
yesterday, up from 23 percent a week earlier and 26 percent, on
average, during the prior five years, the government said.
Seeding of oats was 75 percent complete, up from 63 percent a
week earlier and the five-year average of 60 percent.  
 Cotton, Spring Wheat  
 Cotton growers had sown 16 percent of the crop, compared
with 11 percent a week earlier and 15 percent a year earlier,
the USDA said. The five-year average was 18 percent. Rice was 69
percent seeded, up from 47 percent a week earlier and the five-
year average of 50 percent.  
 About 43 percent of the spring-wheat was planted in the
northern Great Plains, compared with 20 percent a week earlier,
the USDA said. The average for the previous five years was 27
percent.  
 About 69 percent of the winter-wheat crop was in good or
excellent condition, unchanged a week earlier, the USDA said.
That compares to 45 percent a year earlier, when plants were
harmed by drought. In Kansas, the biggest grower of hard-red
winter wheat, about 73 percent of the crop was rated good or
excellent, up from 71 percent a week earlier.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion, behind hay, according to the USDA.
