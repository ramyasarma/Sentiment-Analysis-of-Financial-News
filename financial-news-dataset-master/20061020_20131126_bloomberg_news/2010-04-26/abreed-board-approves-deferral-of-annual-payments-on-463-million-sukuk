             National Central Cooling Co., the
United Arab Emirates-based refrigeration company, said its board
approved deferral of annual payments on 1.7 billion dirhams
($463 million) of Islamic bonds maturing in 2011.  
 The annual payment due May 19 was deffered pending further
consideration by the board of “potential amendments to the
terms of 2008 sukuk in connection with the company’s
recapitalization program,” the company, known as Tabreed, said
in a statement to the Dubai bourse today.
