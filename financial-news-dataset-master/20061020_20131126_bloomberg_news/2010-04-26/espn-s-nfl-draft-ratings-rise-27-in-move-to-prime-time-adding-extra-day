             Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN drew its
most viewers in 31 years of broadcasting the National Football
League’s draft as the event expanded to a three-day format with
the first three rounds being in prime time.  
 The network averaged 3.7 million viewers for its 14 1/2
hours of draft coverage on ESPN and ESPN2 according to
preliminary national data, ESPN said in a news release. That’s a
27 percent increase over the 2009 draft, the network said,
citing Nielsen Media Research.  
 The draft made its debut in prime time this year, airing at
night on both April 22 for the first round and April 23 for the
following two rounds. It concluded with Rounds 4 through 7 the
afternoon of April 24.
