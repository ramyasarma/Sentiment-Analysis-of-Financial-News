             Portugal will donate 800 million
euros ($1.07 billion) to Angola and lend it a further 800
million euros, the Luanda-based broadcaster reported, citing
Angolan Finance Minister Carlos Lopes.  
 The southern African nation may use 500 million euros of
that to pay its debt to Portuguese building companies, Radio
Nacional de Angola reported Lopes as saying.  
 Angola is carrying out the reconstruction of its
infrastructure ravaged by a 27-year civil conflict that ended in
2002. Portuguese construction companies Grupo Soares da Costa
SGPS SA, Teixeira Duarte-Engenharia Construcoes SA and Somague
SGPS operate in Angola. Lopes didn’t say how much is owed to
them.
