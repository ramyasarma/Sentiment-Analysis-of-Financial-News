             Treasury two-year notes are moving
into a bearish phase, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
citing the momentum of the securities.  
 The speed at which the yield is increasing toward a support
band from 1.10 percent to 1.18 percent indicates further
downward movement for the security, with “major support” at
1.22 percent, said William O’Donnell, U.S. government bond
strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut, in a
research note today.  
 “You can see that momentum still aims bearishly and how
we’re fast approaching the support band,” wrote O’Donnell,
whose firm is one of the 18 primary dealers obliged to
participate in Treasury auctions.  
 The two-year note’s yield decreased 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.04 percent today after reaching 1.08
percent, the highest level since April 12.  
 The Treasury will auction tomorrow $44 billion in two-year
debt, part of a record $129 billion in notes that the U.S.
government is selling this week.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  
 Support refers to levels on a chart that indicate where buy
orders may be concentrated. A break of an area of support or
resistance signals a currency or security may move to the next
level on the chart.
