             Japan Post Bank Co. and Japan Post
Insurance Co. may together invest as much as 10 trillion yen
($106 billion) in overseas funds, the Asahi newspaper reported,
citing an interview with Internal Affairs Minister Kazuhiro
Haraguchi.   
 The move comes as the government plans to allow the postal
bank to double to 20 million yen the amount of deposits it can
take from individuals. Japan Post Bank and Japan Post Insurance
are units of Japan Post Holdings Co., which is wholly owned by
the government.
