             Barclays Plc and Solent Capital
Partners LLP won dismissal of Oddo Asset Management’s lawsuit
accusing them of using structured investment vehicles as a
“dumping ground for toxic assets.”  
 New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick
dismissed all of Paris-based Oddo’s claims, according to a
ruling filed with the court yesterday.  
 “As Barclays contends, Oddo is a sophisticated entity in
the position of appreciating the inherent risks associated with
debt securities, including the fact that, under certain
circumstances, interest payments may cease and the principal may
be lost,” Kapnick said in her ruling dated April 23.  
 Oddo, a fund management unit of Oddo & Cie, sued Barclays
in state court in Manhattan in 2008, claiming the U.K.’s second-
biggest bank transferred subprime mortgage-backed securities at
“inflated prices” to two SIVs it had created, the Mainsail II
Ltd. and Golden Key Ltd. Oddo sought damages from Barclays for
allegedly aiding breaches of fiduciary duty by the SIVs’
managers, including London-based Solent Capital Partners LLP.  
 Oddo claimed Solent caused the SIVs to acquire the inferior
mortgage-backed securities and went along with the transfer
because it didn’t want to jeopardize its relationship with
Barclays, according to the ruling.  
 By 2007, both SIVs were frozen because they had plummeted
in value because of the securities they contained, according to
the ruling. In 2008, they were put into receivership.  
 S&P Rating  
 McGraw-Hill Cos. also was named as a defendant because
Barclays retained its Standard & Poor’s unit to issue ratings on
the notes for the SIVs.  
 “We are pleased that the judge granted our motion to
dismiss in its entirety,” said Frank Briamonte, a spokesman for
McGraw-Hill.  
 Representatives of Oddo and Solent couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment after regular business hours yesterday.
Lance Croffoot-Suede, a lawyer for Barclays, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message left at his office after regular
business hours yesterday.  
 The case is Oddo Asset Management v. Barclays Bank,
109547/08, New York Supreme Court (Manhattan).
