             Japanese Internal Affairs Minister
Kazuhiro Haraguchi will reduce next year’s government hiring by
a record 40 percent, Nikkei News reported today, without saying
where it obtained the information.  
 The cuts are the result of middle-aged employees extending
their state careers after the Hatoyama administration banned
civil servants retiring early to take employment with industries
they regulated, the report said. The practice is known in
Japanese as “amakudari,” or descent from heaven.  
 As a result, there will be 3,600 fewer new hires for the
year beginning April 1, 2011, the biggest decrease on record,
the report said.
