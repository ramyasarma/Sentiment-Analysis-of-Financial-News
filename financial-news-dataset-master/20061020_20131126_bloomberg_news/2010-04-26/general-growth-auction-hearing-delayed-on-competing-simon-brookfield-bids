             General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, said a bankruptcy court hearing
on its auction process will be delayed five days to give the
company time to consider competing investment plans.  
 Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management
Inc. are each leading groups that want to back General Growth,
which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the
past year. The hearing was postponed to May 4 from April 29,
Chicago-based General Growth said today in a statement.  
 The delay will allow General Growth to speak with its
investor committees and “other parties concerning the full
range of offers, proposals and commitments received and complete
its assessment thereof,” the company said.  
 Simon, spurned in February when it offered to buy General
Growth outright for $10 billion, earlier this month said it
would match the terms of a bankruptcy-exit proposal led by
Brookfield. Each plan would keep General Growth an independent
company, and would need bankruptcy court approval. Simon, the
largest U.S. mall owner, has said it is still interested in a
full takeover of its rival.  
 General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York’s South
Street Seaport, Boston’s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas.  
 The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
