             South Africa’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index rose 378.07, or 1.3 percent, to 29,309.47 in
Johannesburg, its highest close since April 15.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 Barloworld Ltd. (BAW SJ) declined 1.31 rand, or 2.5
percent, to 50.90 rand, the most in a month. The diversified
will report a loss for the first half through March compared to
a profit a year earlier.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, rallied 5.28 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 245.58 rand,
snapping three days of declines. Anglo American Plc (AGL SJ)
climbed 6.57 rand, or 2 percent, to 332.50 rand. Copper
increased for a second day as Greece moved toward securing an
emergency aid package, easing concerns of an economic slowdown
in the euro region.  
 Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP SJ), the world’s second-
largest platinum producer, rose 4.58 rand, or 2.2 percent, to
212.48 rand. Platinum advanced as much as 0.7 percent to $1,754

 MTN Group Ltd. (MTN SJ), Africa’s largest mobile-phone
company, slid 50 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 109.50 rand, paring
an earlier drop of 1.4 percent. Orascom Telecom Holding SAE said
it will release “material news” tomorrow, without providing
further details in a statement sent to the Egyptian exchange.  
 MTN approached banks for $5 billion to help fund the
acquisition of units from Orascom in a deal that may be worth as
much as $10 billion, people with knowledge of the plan said
April 22.
