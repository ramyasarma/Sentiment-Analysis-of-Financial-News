             The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate bonds fell, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 7 basis
points to 415, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at 7:33
a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and a decline signals
improvement in perceptions of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.75 basis points to 84.75,
JPMorgan prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from
default also fell, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers down 1.5 at 110 and the subordinated index 3
lower at 175.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
