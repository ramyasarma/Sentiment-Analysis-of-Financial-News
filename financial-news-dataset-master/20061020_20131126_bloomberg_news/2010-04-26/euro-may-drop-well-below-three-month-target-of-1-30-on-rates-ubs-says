             The euro may weaken to less than
$1.30 this year should the Federal Reserve start raising
interest rates before policy makers in Europe, UBS AG said.  
 “If the Fed does hike before the European Central Bank and
the Banks of Japan and England, the dollar will become a growth
currency again rather than a safe haven,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin,
chief currency strategist in Singapore, wrote in a report
received yesterday. “This suggests euro-dollar and pound-dollar
remain at risk in 2010 of falling well below our three-month
targets of $1.30 and $1.48, respectively.”  
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3352 as of 7:31 a.m. in
London, with the pound rising 0.4 percent $1.5436.
