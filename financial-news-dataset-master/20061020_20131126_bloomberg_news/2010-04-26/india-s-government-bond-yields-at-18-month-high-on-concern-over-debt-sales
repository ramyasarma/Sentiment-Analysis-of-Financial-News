             India’s 10-year bonds dropped for a
second day, pushing their yield to an 18-month high, on concern
appetite for the debt will cool as the government steps up sales
to finance its budget deficit.  
 The government may issue 120 billion rupees ($2.7 billion)
of bonds this week, according to the central bank’s indicative
auction calendar. The details of the securities to be sold will
be announced today. The Reserve Bank of India increased its
benchmark policy rates by a quarter-percentage point each at a
meeting on April 20.  
 “The fact that the government’s borrowing program is
robust will continue to push up yields,” said Krishnamurthy
Harihar, Mumbai-based treasurer at the Indian unit of FirstRand
Ltd., South Africa’s second-largest financial services company.
“Given the outlook for inflation and the economy, more
interest-rate hikes are also expected.”  
 The yield on the 6.35 percent note due January 2020 rose
one basis point to 8.07 percent as of 9:40 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.06, or 6 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 88.58. The 10-
year yield rose as much as three basis points to 8.09 percent
earlier, its highest since October 2008.  
 The Finance Ministry has already borrowed 370 billion
rupees of its record 4.57 trillion rupees target for the fiscal
year that began April 1, 36 percent more than in April last year.  
 The central bank said on April 23 it would auction 90
billion rupees of treasury bills on April 28.
