             BlackRock Inc.’s first-quarter
profit fell short of analysts’ estimates as investors slowed
deposits into its funds, sending shares of the world’s biggest
asset manager down the most in a year.  
 BlackRock’s profit excluding some costs was $2.40 a share,
the New York-based company said today in a statement. The
average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
$2.44.  
 Net income rose fivefold to $423 million as BlackRock
benefited from the first full quarter following its purchase of
Barclays Global Investors. Some investors who had invested with
both managers before the acquisition withdrew money because they
ended up with too much overseen by a single firm. Investors also
reassessed their holdings after 2009’s rally in global markets.  
 “There were some dislocations, which we’re hoping are
short-term,” Jeffrey Hopson, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus &
Co. in St. Louis, said in an interview. “This doesn’t change
our view that the BGI transaction will prove to be an excellent
one.”  
 The stock fell $18.07, or 8.6 percent, to $192.95 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most
since a 9.1 percent drop on April 20, 2009. The decline left
BlackRock at its lowest price since Sept. 2.  
 Fund Flows  
 Net outflows from cash-management funds were $39.6 billion,
BlackRock said, compared with the $400 million of deposits
during the fourth quarter of 2009. Net inflows into long-term
funds were $8.9 billion, following $41.8 billion of deposits
during the prior quarter.  
 Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has overseen
BlackRock’s growth since its founding, including the Dec. 1
purchase of London-based Barclays Plc’s investment unit. The
acquisition added the biggest lineup of exchange-traded funds
and more than doubled assets under management to $3.36 trillion.
Investors moved money from active to passive funds during the
first quarter as they re-evaluated their investments, Fink said
today in a conference call with investors.  
 “Some clients were actually de-risking,” Fink said of
investors with large profits in stock and credit markets who put
money into passive strategies.  
 Investors deposited $4.6 billion in stock index funds and
$900 million in active equity strategies during the quarter,
BlackRock said. Quantitative funds, which use mathematical
models to pick stocks, had $8.8 billion in outflows.  
 Investment Allocations  
 Index bond funds and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs,
gathered $13.6 billion. Investors pulled $14.4 billion from
active bond funds as they made changes to asset allocations.
Investors have agreed to add $35.2 billion into BlackRock funds
as of April 20.  
 First-quarter revenue at BlackRock more than doubled to
about $2 billion, while expenses rose 87 percent to $1.3
billion, driven by compensation costs.  
 BlackRock’s $15.2 billion purchase of Barclays Global
Investors was the biggest transaction to combine an active
manager with one that manages passive investments, such as ETFs.
Indexed strategies including ETFs account for about $1.7
trillion in assets at BlackRock. Active portfolios account for
about $1.2 trillion and money funds for about $300 billion. The
remainder is in advisory assets.  
 Exchange-traded funds are typically designed to mimic the
performance of indexes. Unlike mutual funds, whose shares are
priced once daily after the end of each trading session, ETFs
are listed on an exchange where shares are bought and sold
throughout the day like stocks.  
 Low-Cost Alternatives  
 ETF assets in the U.S. surged 67 percent to $750 billion in
the year ended in February, according to data from the
Investment Company Institute in Washington, as investors sought
low-cost alternatives to active funds. During the first quarter
of 2010, ETF flows were $7.7 billion, according to data from
Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.  
 Deposits into ETFs slowed during the first-quarter as
institutional investors sold their holdings, mainly for tax
reasons, Fink said today in the conference call. BlackRock’s
IShares unit held $509 billion in assets as of March 31.  
 “What we’ve learned is that you see a lot of seasonality
in the index products,” Fink said.  
 BlackRock expanded its equity business with the 2006
purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co.’s money-management unit.
Including the equity assets from its BGI purchase, BlackRock now
has about 47 percent of its assets, or $1.58 trillion, in stock
funds. BlackRock’s stock funds alone hold more in assets than
Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which managed $1.5 trillion
as of Dec. 31. BlackRock has about a third in bonds, placing it
ahead of rival Pacific Investment Management Co.
