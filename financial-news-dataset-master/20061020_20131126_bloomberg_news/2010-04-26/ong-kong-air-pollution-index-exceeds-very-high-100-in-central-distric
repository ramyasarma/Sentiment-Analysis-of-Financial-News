             Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index
reached the “very high” level of 112 at the roadside station
in the city’s Central district today, the Environmental
Protection Department said on its Web site. Readings above 100
trigger a government warning that people with heart or
respiratory illnesses should avoid prolonged stays in areas with
heavy traffic.
