             Argentine bonds advanced the most
in five weeks after a U.S. judge said he won’t interfere with
the South American nation’s offer to restructure $20 billon in
defaulted debt held out of a 2005 settlement.  
 The yield on Argentina’s 7 percent dollar bonds due 2015
slid 28 basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, to 11.47 percent
at 4:34 p.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg pricing data.
The bond’s price rose 1.01 cents, the most since March 18, to
82.81 cents on the dollar.  
 U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in New York said today in
a six-page order that Argentina can make its offer directly to
holders of defaulted debt who are suing the republic, rejecting
a request by the bondholders’ lawyers to have the offer made
through them.  
 “Judge Griesa’s ruling helped move the market some
today,” said Javier Salvucci, a portfolio manager with Silver
Cloud Advisors in Buenos Aires. “Volume was up some today, but
the market is still waiting for the government to officially
open the swap.”  
 The bondholders’ lawyers had argued that under U.S. court
rules, Argentina can’t make the offer directly to investors
covered by the class-action lawsuits without court oversight.  
 Siding with the bondholders’ lawyers “would involve the
court in actions which could mean the class members are deprived
of whatever opportunity the exchange offer affords,” Griesa
wrote.  
 Offer Terms  
 Argentine debt slid for five days after Economy Minister
Amado Boudou unveiled the general terms of the restructuring on
April 15. Argentina will offer investors 33.7 cents on the
dollar for securities due in 2033, warrants linked to gross
domestic product, and pay past due interest with 8.75 percent
dollar bonds due in 2017. The government will not include past-
due payments on the GDP warrants.  
 Boudou said last week that the government will formally
open the offer once it has been approved by regulators in Italy,
home to tens of thousands of individual bondholders. The Italian
regulator, Consob, will likely make its decision this week,
according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to
be identified.  
 Argentina’s offer -- as measured in net-present value terms
-- is worth 52.3 cents on the dollar for institutional
investors, RBS Securities Inc. said. The value of the first
exchange, excluding interest on interest, was 59.63 cents on the
dollar, Credit Suisse AG said.  
 The government says a settlement with remaining creditors
will help Argentina regain market access and credibility among
investors nine years after the government defaulted on $95
billion of debt.  
 The peso was little changed at 3.872 per dollar, from
3.8725 at the end of last week.
