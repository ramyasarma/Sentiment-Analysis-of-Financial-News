             The Obama administration formally
put its support behind Senate legislation overhauling U.S.
financial regulations and warned it will oppose efforts to
weaken it.  
 A statement of administration policy released by the White
House budget office today called the legislation sponsored by
Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut “critical”
to prevent financial abuses and reduce the risk of the kind of
crisis that led to a $700 billion bailout of financial companies
in 2008.  
 The statement also said “the administration will oppose
efforts to add loopholes to the bill that undermine consumer and
investor protection or that allow institutions to avoid
oversight.”  
 The Senate is scheduled to vote later today on whether to
begin debate on the legislation. All 41 Senate Republicans may
vote to block proceeding with debate.
