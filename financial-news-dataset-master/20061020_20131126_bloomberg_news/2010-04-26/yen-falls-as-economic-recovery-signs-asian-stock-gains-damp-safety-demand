             The yen fell against higher-
yielding currencies as signs the global economic recovery is
gaining momentum boosted demand for riskier assets.  
 Japan’s currency weakened against all 16 of its most-traded
peers as stocks rose and a U.K. report showed house prices
climbed for a ninth month. U.S. data this week may show the
housing market is stabilizing. South Korea’s won advanced to a
19-month high versus the dollar as overseas investors pumped
more money into the nation’s shares to profit from accelerating
economic growth.  
 “Data across the globe underscore the economy is
recovering, which then boosts risk sentiment,” said Koichi
Kurose, chief strategist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., a unit of
Japan’s fourth-largest banking group. “Buoyant risk sentiment
will encourage investors to sell the yen and re-invest in
higher-yielding assets.”  
 The yen weakened to 125.94 per euro as of 8:24 a.m. in
London, from 125.73 in New York last week. The currency
depreciated to 94.12 per dollar, from 93.97, and declined to
87.42 per Australian dollar, from 87.19. It earlier slid to
87.61, the weakest since September 2008. The euro traded at
$1.3382, from $1.3384.  
 The won rose 0.5 percent to 1,103.80 per dollar, after
advancing to 1,102.85, the strongest since September 2008. The
MSCI World Index of shares advanced 0.7 percent.  
 Pound Gains  
 The pound gained versus the dollar, the euro and the yen
after London-based Hometrack Ltd. said the average cost of a
home in England and Wales increased 0.2 percent from March. The
S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index in the U.S. climbed 1.3
percent, the first increase since December 2006, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists before tomorrow’s report.  
 “The recovery of economies around the world, including the
U.K., appears to be firm,” said Yuji Saito, director of the
foreign-exchange department at Credit Agricole Corporate and
Investment Bank in Tokyo. “The pound may be bought.”  
 The U.K. currency advanced 0.7 percent to $1.5489 and
appreciated 0.7 percent to 86.42 pence per euro. Sterling rose
0.8 percent to 145.68 yen.  
 The won gained for the first time in three days versus the
dollar before reports this week that economists said will show
gross domestic product rose at a faster pace and exports climbed
for a sixth month. The Kospi index gained 0.9 percent as
overseas funds bought more Korean shares than they sold for a
fourth day.  
 Korean Growth  
 “Data this week is expected to be very strong,” said
Peter Redward, head of rates research at Barclays Plc. in
Singapore. “Combine that with strong risk appetite and very
good demand for Korean assets, which is reinforcing the won.”  
 A Bank of Korea report tomorrow will show the economy
expanded 7.5 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter,
the most since 2002, according to a Bloomberg survey. Exports
increased 32 percent in April, a separate survey showed before
the May 1 report.  
 The dollar advanced to its strongest in almost three weeks
versus the yen on speculation the Federal Reserve is moving
closer to withdrawing stimulus measures amid signs the U.S.
economic recovery is intact.  
 Fed policy makers meeting April 27 and April 28 will try to
decide how and when to sell mortgage-backed securities and
reduce its balance sheet, the Wall Street Journal said April 23,
without saying where it got the information.  
 “Our economists note there is some potential for a very
modest reworking of the key policy guidance language,” Gareth
Berry, a currency strategist in Singapore at UBS AG, wrote in a
research note today. “We continue to look for further dollar
strength as the Fed shows every intention of gradually
continuing down the path to policy normalization.”  
 Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade show a 72 percent
chance the Fed will raise its benchmark rate at least a quarter-
percentage point by its December meeting.
