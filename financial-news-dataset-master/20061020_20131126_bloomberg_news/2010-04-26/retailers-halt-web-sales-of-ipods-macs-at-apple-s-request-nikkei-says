             Some Japanese consumer electronics
stores have halted online sales of Apple Inc. products at the
U.S. company’s request, Nikkei English News said, citing
retailer Yodobashi Camera Co.  
 Apple may not have wanted retailers to sell products at a
discount at online stores, the report said, citing unidentified
people in the industry. Apple’s Japan unit declined to comment,
the Nikkei said.
