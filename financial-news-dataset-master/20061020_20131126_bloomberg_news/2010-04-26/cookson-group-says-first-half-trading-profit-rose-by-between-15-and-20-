             Cookson Group Plc, the world’s
biggest maker of ceramic linings for metal smelters, rose by the
most in five months in London trading after forecasting a rise
in first-half profit of as much as 20 percent.  
 Profit will likely be 110 million pounds ($170 million) to
115 million pounds for the first half, 15 percent to 20 percent
more than for the last six months of 2009, the company said
today in a Regulatory News Service statement.  
 Revenue will rise 25 percent to 27 percent compared with
the first half of 2009.  
 “Global steel production, notably for Europe and NAFTA,
has grown at a faster rate in the first quarter of 2010 than
previously anticipated,” the company said.  
 Cookson gained as much as 47.5 pence, or 8.4 percent, to
616 pence per share, the most since Nov. 10, 2009. It traded 38
pence, or 6.7 percent, higher at 606.5 pence at 9:30 a.m. in
London.
