             Corn gained on speculation that
China’s surging economy will bolster demand for the grain from
the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter.  
 Currencies in Asia, the biggest buyer of corn and soybeans,
rose on speculation that investors will plow more funds into the
region. China’s economy in the first quarter expanded at the
fastest pace in almost three years. The country’s top grain
administrator said last week that stockpiles of grain and
cooking oil need to be increased to stabilize domestic prices.  
 “There is talk that China is shopping for some U.S.
corn,” said Mark Schultz, the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “It would not surprise
anyone that China would need to boost imports.”  
 Corn futures for July delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.625 a bushel at 10:41 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the fourth gain in five sessions. Last week, the price
fell 3.5 percent as U.S. farmers accelerated planting at the
fastest pace since at least 2004, increasing the yield potential
of the crop.  
 China, the second-biggest consumer of corn and the largest
buyer of soybeans, has been increasing purchases of U.S. dried
distiller’s grain, a byproduct of ethanol production from corn
that is used in animal feed, Schultz said. Corn futures on
China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange have gained 14 percent in the
past year on speculation that a 2008 drought may have cut output
by more than the government’s official estimate.  
 The Asian nation boosted purchases of dried distiller’s
grain to about 213,000 metric tons in the first two months of
2010 from 1,250 tons in the same period last year, USDA data
show. Last year, Chinese purchases ballooned to a record of more
than 542,000 tons from less than 9,000 a year earlier.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
