             Wheat dropped the most in a week,
down from the highest price since March, on speculation that
favorable weather will bolster U.S. production in the southern
Great Plains.  
 Sunshine and cool weather forecast over the next two weeks
will bolster development of the winter-wheat crop, after rain
fell last weekend, said Drew Lerner, the president of World
Weather Inc. in Overland Park, Kansas. About 69 percent of the
crop was in good or excellent condition as of yesterday,
compared with 43 percent a year earlier, the Department of
Agriculture said today after the close of trading in Chicago.  
 “It’s looks like a really good weather forecast for crop
potential,” said Brian Grete, senior market analyst for the
Profession Farmers of America newsletter, based in Cedar Falls,
Iowa. “The crop has had timely rains.”  
 Wheat futures for July delivery fell 17.5 cents, or 3.5
percent, to $4.88 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest drop since April 19. Earlier, wheat touched $5.15, the
highest level for a most-active contract since March 4.  
 Planting of spring varieties progressed from Montana to
Minnesota during the past week as mostly dry weather firmed
soils for heavy farm machinery, Lerner said. Spring wheat was
planted on 43 percent of intended acreage in the top six
producing states as of yesterday, compared with 20 percent for
the year-earlier crop, which was delayed by rain, data from the
USDA show.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
