             New Zealand’s dollar may rise to a
19-month high against the yen after breaking through a key level
of so-called resistance last week, Gaitame.Com Research
Institute Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  
 The kiwi’s 3.2 percent advance last week pushed the
currency above a resistance line connecting highs reached in
October and January, signaling it will extend gains, said Takuya
Kawabata, a researcher at the unit of Japan’s largest foreign-
exchange margin company in Tokyo.  
 “The currency has stayed above the line since then,
indicating that resistance is turning into support,” Kawabata
said in an interview with Bloomberg News yesterday. “New
Zealand’s dollar is poised to test higher prices.”  
 New Zealand’s currency traded at 67.90 yen as of 10:53 a.m.
in Wellington, having gained 6.8 percent over the past three
months. The currency rose 1.4 percent on April 23, breaking
through a line connecting its highs of 69.74 yen on Oct. 23 and
68.67 yen on Jan. 8.  
 The currency may now climb back to its Jan. 8 level to form
a so-called double top, Kawabata said. A double top occurs when
a currency makes two consecutive peaks around the same height.  
 Should the kiwi rise above 68.67 yen, it would then be
poised to retest the Oct. 23 high, and then 70 yen, a major
psychological level, Kawabata said. The currency last traded
above 70 yen in October 2008.  
 Resistance refers to an area where sell orders may be
clustered. Support is an area where analysts anticipate orders
to buy a currency and its related instruments.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
