             BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest
money manager, said first-quarter earnings rose fivefold after
the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors added assets and
lifted fees.  
 Net income increased to $423 million, or $2.17 a share,
from $84 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier, the New York-
based company said today in a statement. Excluding some costs,
BlackRock’s profit was $2.40 a share, missing the $2.44 average
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has built
BlackRock into the world’s biggest asset manager with the Dec. 1
purchase of London-based Barclays Plc’s investment unit, which
added the largest lineup of exchange-traded funds and more than
doubled assets to $3.36 trillion. Investors deposited $8.9
billion into long-term funds at BlackRock, while removing $39.6
billion from cash and money-market funds.  
 “The flows picture is looking generally solid for
BlackRock with the passive funds,” Jeffrey Hopson, an analyst
with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in St. Louis, said before the results
were announced. “The only areas that aren’t doing as well on
the flows are the money-market funds and quantitative funds,”
which use mathematical models to pick securities.  
 Hopson, who rates BlackRock shares a “buy,” expected the
company to earn $2.46 a share excluding some items. Earnings in
the year-earlier period were reduced by 73 cents a share by
declines in the value of co-investments alongside investors in
its own funds.  
 ETF Surge  
 Investors put $4.6 billion into stock index funds, and $900
million into active equity strategies during the quarter,
BlackRock said. Quantitative funds, which use mathematical
models to pick stocks, had $8.8 billion in outflows. Index bond
funds and exchange-traded funds gathered $13.6 billion, while
investors pulled $14.4 billion from active bond funds as
institutions made changes to asset allocations, BlackRock said.  
 “Following last year’s sharp rally in global equity
markets and significant tightening of credit spreads,
institutional investors stepped back to reassess their asset
allocation strategies,” Fink said in today’s statement.  
 Inflows into passive funds and alternative products will
help add $200 billion in new business annually over the next
five years, President Robert Kapito said in an April 9
interview.  
 BGI Purchase  
 BlackRock’s $15.2 billion purchase of BGI is the biggest to
combine an active manager with one that manages passive
investments, such as ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares unit managed $509
billion in assets, as of March 31. Alternative strategies such
as hedge funds account for $102 billion.  
 Exchange-traded fund assets in the U.S. surged 67 percent
to $750 billion in the year ended in February, according to data
from the Investment Company Institute in Washington, as
investors sought low-cost alternatives to active funds. Mutual
funds in the U.S. held $10.97 trillion as of February, according
to the ICI.  
 BlackRock expanded its equity business with the 2006
purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co.’s money-management unit.
Including the equity assets from its BGI purchase, BlackRock now
has about 47 percent of its assets, or $1.58 trillion, in stock
funds. BlackRock’s stock funds alone hold more in assets than
Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which managed $1.5 trillion
as of Dec. 31. BlackRock has about a third in bonds, placing it
ahead of rival Pacific Investment Management Co.  
 BlackRock announced earnings before the start of regular
U.S. trading. BlackRock shares have declined 8.7 percent this
year, compared with the 9.8 percent gain in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.
