             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by shareholders over a collateralized-debt obligation known as
Abacus 2007-AC1 that prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit this month.  
 Goldman Sachs didn’t disclose the truth about Abacus or the
bank’s financial condition, investors said in the complaint
filed today in federal court in Manhattan. “As news of
Goldman’s misconduct reached the market, Goldman stock
immediately plummeted,” according to the complaint.  
 When the SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, its shares
fell 13 percent to close at $160.70. That case centers on
whether the New York-based firm should have told investors that
hedge fund Paulson & Co. helped pick underlying securities in
the CDO -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn’t accused of
wrongdoing.  
 “Defendants omitted and/or misrepresented material facts
concerning Goldman’s participation in structuring the CDO to
help one client who was short the CDO while simultaneously
selling the CDO to another client,” investors said in today’s
complaint.  
 Investor Ilene Richman filed the lawsuit on behalf of
others who bought Goldman Sachs shares from Oct. 15 to April 16.  
 Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment today.  
 The securities-fraud suit, filed by San Diego-based law
firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP, also names as defendants
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar and President Gary D. Cohn.  
 SEC Investigation  
 The bank concealed from investors that it was being
investigated by the SEC over the CDO late last year, at the same
time it launched a public-relations campaign touting its
“responsible business practices” to combat negative publicity
over $16 billion in bonuses it was scheduled to pay employees,
according to the complaint.  
 Goldman Sachs didn’t disclose the SEC probe in its third-
quarter filing with the commission on Nov. 4, according to the
complaint.  
 On April 22, two investors separately sued Goldman Sachs
officers and directors, including Blankfein, on behalf of the
bank in state court in Manhattan for permitting the company to
enter into a series of CDOs, including Abacus 2007-AC1, tied to
the subprime market. Another so-called derivative lawsuit was
filed against the officers and directors today in federal court
in Manhattan.  
 Goldman Sachs fell $5.37, or 3.4 percent, to $152.03 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 The case is Richman v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 10-03461,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
