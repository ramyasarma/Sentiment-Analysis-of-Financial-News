             Jim Teeney has some advice for
Diageo Plc, as he sips Guinness Black Lager: cut the price.  
 The beer is on trial at 400 bars across Northern Ireland.
The lager, which shares the iconic stout’s name and color, may
be rolled out across Europe if it succeeds in the U.K. province.
It sells for 3 pounds ($4.64) per bottle, about two-thirds more
expensive than a standard pint of lager.  
 “I like it,” said Teeney, a 42-year-old postal worker, in
the Duke of York bar in Belfast. “But I won’t be switching to
it. I can get a pint of lager for nearly half the price.”  
 Guinness Black Lager is the London-based brewer’s latest
attempt to bolster beer sales in its battle with rivals Heineken
NV and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, which controls Budweiser.
European Guinness volumes fell 3 percent in the second half of
2009, the company said in February.  
 “People either love Guinness or wouldn’t go near it,
whereas lager is accessible to most people,” said Andy Blain,
an analyst at Shore Capital Group Ltd. in London. “Guinness is
a strong brand, but they need to look at new areas.”  
 Guinness has tried to extend the brand in the past. Earlier
varieties included Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout, Guinness
Gold and Breo White Beer. None of these are on general sale any
longer. A half-strength Guinness Beer which began testing in
western Ireland in 2008 is now sold at 300 Irish outlets.  
 Duke Of York  
 Diageo says the latest offering is different. “This isn’t
a variation on stout, this is a completely different product,”
said Pamela Selby, marketing manager for Guinness in Ireland.
“We aren’t looking to entice Guinness drinkers to the new
product as such, we are looking at lager drinkers.”  
 Drinkers at the Duke of York pub in the city’s Cathedral
Quarter have mostly reacted positively to the new beverage, said
bar manager Danny Cushenhan.  
 “This is quite a clever product,” he said. “It has the
Guinness tag, but it’s appealing to the crowd who like lager.”  
 The drink, aimed at men aged between 25 and 35, is sold in
330 milliliter bottles. A pint of lager - which is 568
milliliters - sells for about 3.20 pounds in the city.  
 Not all drinkers are convinced. “I don’t like it,” said
Fintan Gray, 37, a school teacher from Belfast. “If I want a
lager I’ll go for something fizzier and something I can drink
from a pint glass instead of a bottle.”
