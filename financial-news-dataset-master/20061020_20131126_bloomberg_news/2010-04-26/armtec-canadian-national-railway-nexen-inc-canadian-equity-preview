             Canadian stocks  fell for the first
time in seven days after energy and financial companies dropped
as Standard & Poor’s ratings cuts spurred concern that debt
defaults in Europe will slow economic growth.  
 Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals producer,
lost 5 percent as S&P cut the rating on Portugal’s debt two
levels to A- and lowered Greece’s sovereign debt rating to junk.
Canadian National Railway Ltd. slumped 2.4 percent on analyst
downgrades after its quarterly earnings report. Toronto-Dominion
Bank, Canada’s second-largest bank, slipped 1.7 percent.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  fell 134.23
points, or 1.1 percent, to 12,146.74. The index had rallied 1.7
percent during its six-day streak of advances as North American
companies including EnCana Corp., Boeing Co. and Caterpillar
Inc. beat analyst earnings estimates. It dropped less today than
any of the other developed country markets that were open during
the S&P ratings announcements.  
 “Everyone is looking for a little bit of a pullback,”
said  Greg Taylor , who helps oversee about C$4.2 billion ($4.1
billion) as a money manager at Aurion Capital Management in
Toronto. “With some of the continuing concern from Greece,
there seems to be a reason to be a little more cautious. The
concerns around Europe are still there with Portugal being
downgraded.”  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Commodity Price Index  declined
the most since Feb. 5. Teck tumbled 5 percent to C$41.05 as
copper decreased the most since June. Copper and zinc producer
Lundin Mining Corp. plunged 5.8 percent to C$5.05.  
 Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., which is building a copper and gold
mine in Mongolia, sank 6 percent to C$16.73. The Asian country
put a freeze on new mining licenses and transfers of existing
permits.  
 Energy Shares  
 Crude oil lost 2.1 percent to $82.44 a barrel in New York.
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the country’s second-largest
energy company by market value, decreased 2.8 percent to
C$76.26. Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s biggest oil and gas
company, retreated 1.5 percent to C$33.91.  
 Nexen Inc., an oil and gas producer that operates on five
continents, slumped 4.1 percent to C$25.42. The company said it
earned  35 cents a share  in the first quarter, missing the
average of 13 analyst estimates by 13 percent, excluding certain
items.  
 Gold producers  helped the S&P/TSX avoid a further dive as
investors looked for an alternative to holding currencies. The
metal advanced to a two-week high.  
 Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
advanced 2 percent to C$41.43. Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s second-
largest gold-mining company, increased 2 percent to C$41.67.
NovaGold Resources Inc., which mines in Canada and Alaska, led
the S&P/TSX with a 5.6 percent jump to a 20-month high of
C$8.28.  
 Financial companies  retreated after the announcements from
S&P. TD fell 1.7 percent to C$75.37. Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, the No. 5 bank by assets, slipped 2 percent to
C$75.43. Manulife Financial Corp., the country’s biggest
insurer, dropped 1.8 percent to C$18.94.  
 Wider Loss  
 Panelboard producer Norbord Inc. retreated after failing to
match  analyst forecasts , sinking 6.6 percent to C$20.04. The
company said it had a loss of 12 cents a share in the first
quarter, while the average analyst estimate was for a loss of
less than 1 cent a share.  
 Industrial stocks had the biggest decline of 10 industry
groups in the S&P/TSX as Canadian National Railway declined 2.4
percent to C$62.21 after  Tasneem Azim  of UBS AG and  David F.
Newman  of National Bank of Canada cut their ratings on Canada’s
largest railroad to an equivalent to “hold.” Azim told clients
it will be difficult for the Montreal-based company to match
volumes from the second half of last year.  
 Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. , Canada’s other Class I
freight railroad, slipped 2.3 percent to C$58.12.  
 Canfor Pulp Income Fund, which owns a stake in pulp mill
operator Canfor Pulp LP, soared 10 percent to a two-year high of
C$15.24 after increasing its monthly distribution 67 percent to
20 cents a unit. Analyst  Benoit Laprade  of Bank of Nova Scotia
increased his price estimate on the income trust to C$12.50 from
C$11.
