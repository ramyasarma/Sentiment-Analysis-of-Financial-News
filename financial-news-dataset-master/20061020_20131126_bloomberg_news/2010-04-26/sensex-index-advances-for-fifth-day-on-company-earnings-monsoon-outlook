             India’s stocks advanced for the
fifth day as the nation’s biggest copper producer reported
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates, and after the weather
bureau predicted normal monsoon rainfall.  
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. rose the most in 11 weeks
after its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled as it
benefited from higher metal prices. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., a
tractor maker, climbed to a two-week high. Rains in the June-
September monsoon season may be 98 percent of the 50-year
average, the state forecaster said on April 23. That may ease
inflation after an unexpected drought last year.  
 “The mood is very positive,” said Alex Mathews, head of
research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi.
“A normal monsoon is a big plus for the economy. It will help
the government control inflation. Also, most earnings have been
in line with forecasts.” Mathews advises investors to buy
shares of tractor makers, carmakers and fertilizer companies.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 51.08, or 0.3 percent, to 17,745.28. The gauge’s fifth-
day advance is the longest stretch of gains since September. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange rose 0.4
percent to 5,322.45. The BSE 200 Index increased 0.4 percent to
2,242.25.  
 Sales Boost  
 Sterlite jumped 6 percent to 842.6 rupees. Net income rose
to 13.8 billion rupees ($311 million) in the three months ended
March 31 from 5.98 billion rupees a year earlier, according to
the company’s filing to the stock exchange. The median estimate
of 23 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for profit of 11.1
billion rupees. Sales climbed 64 percent.  
 Rising demand for steel to build air conditioners and cars
is boosting sales of zinc, used to rust-proof the alloy.
Sterlite, part of London-based Vedanta Resources Plc., owns
India’s biggest zinc producer Hindustan Zinc Ltd., whose shares
climbed 2.9 percent to 1,251 rupees.  
 HDFC Bank Ltd., the third-biggest lender, climbed 1.9
percent to 1,989.6 rupees, the highest level since its May 1995
listing. The bank’s fourth-quarter profit rose 33 percent to
8.36 billion rupees ($188 million) on increased lending in an
improving economy. That compares with the 8.34 billion-rupee
average of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Seasonal Rains  
 Housing Development Finance Corp., the biggest mortgage
lender, added 3.8 percent to 2,829.75 rupees, its steepest gain
in two weeks.  
 Mahindra & Mahindra advanced 1.6 percent to 529.35 rupees.
The India Meteorological Department’s April 23 forecast of
normal monsoon rainfall matches predictions by two government
officials on April 21.  
 The rain forecast may further ease inflationary
expectations, the Reserve Bank of India’s Deputy Governor K.C.
Chakrabarty said in Mumbai today. The pace of food-price
increases accelerated to close to an 11-year high this year.  
 India overtook China as the world’s biggest palm oil buyer
and became the largest sugar importer after last year’s weakest
monsoon in more than three decades created shortages.  
 Jaiprakash Associates Ltd., a builder of dams, roads and
bridges, gained 1.1 percent to 159.05 rupees, its highest since
Jan. 19.  
 Reliance Industries Ltd., the nation’s most valuable
company, fell 1.6 percent to 1,071.25 rupees after its fourth-
quarter profit rose 30 percent to 47.1 billion rupees, less than
the 51.4 billion rupees mean estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  
 Fund Inflows  
 Central Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last week estimated
India’s $1.2 trillion economy, Asia’s largest after Japan and
China, will expand 8 percent “with an upward bias” in the year
ending March 31.  
 The rupee appreciated against the dollar for a third day on
speculation foreign capital inflows may increase as seasonal
rainfall boosts farm output that accounts for a fifth of the
economy.  
 “Almost all factors are favorable for the rupee now
because the economy is on a strong growth path, and a normal
monsoon will strengthen the prospects further,” said Sudarshan
Bhatt, chief foreign-exchange dealer at state-owned Corporation
Bank in Mumbai. “The continuing foreign inflows into the stock
market are just one indicator.”  
 Overseas investors bought a net 17.5 billion rupees of
Indian stocks on April 22, taking their total purchases of the
equities this year to 276.4 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years earlier in domestic
currency terms, as the biggest rally in 18 years lured foreign
funds. They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Alembic Ltd. (ALBC IN) gained 3 percent to 51.05 rupees.
Indian cricket’s governing body named the drugmaker’s chairman
and managing director, Chirayu Amin, as the interim chairman of
the Indian Premier League.  
 Apollo Tyres (APTY IN) climbed 1.1 percent to 74.2 rupees.
India’s largest tire maker by value said the International
Finance Corp. has agreed to provide $60 million of loans for a
new tire factory it’s building.  
 Clariant Chemicals (India) Ltd. (CLRC IN) jumped 9.1
percent to 620.25 rupees, the highest since at least 1991. The
unit of the world’s biggest maker of printing-ink chemicals said
first-quarter profit rose 26 percent from a year earlier.  
 Nucleus Software Exports Ltd. (NCS IN), an exporter of
software for finance companies, retreated 2.8 percent to 156.75
rupees, after reporting quarterly profit that fell 4.3 percent
from the same period a year earlier.  
 Religare Enterprises (RELG IN) declined 2 percent to 430.5
rupees. The financial services company owned by billionaire
Malvinder Singh plans to enter the health insurance business
alone after dropping plans to partner with a foreign company,
the Economic Times reported. Religare Managing Director Sunil
Godhwani wasn’t immediately available at his office telephone
for comment on the report.  
 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP IN), India biggest
drugmaker by market value, sank 4.8 percent to 1,603.15 rupees,
its steepest one-day drop in almost nine months. Pfizer Inc. can
ask a U.S. district judge to order Sun to stop selling the drug
until the patent expires in January after a U.S. federal jury
ruled that Pfizer and Altana AG have valid patents for the
heartburn drug Protonix.
