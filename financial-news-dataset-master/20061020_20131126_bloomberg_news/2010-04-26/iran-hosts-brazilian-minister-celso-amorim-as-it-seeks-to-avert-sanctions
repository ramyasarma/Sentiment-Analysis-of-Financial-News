             Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso
Amorim began a two-day visit in Tehran, where he will hold talks
on Iran’s nuclear program as the Islamic republic fights a U.S.-
led drive for a fourth round of sanctions.  
 Amorim, who arrived today in the Iranian capital, is
scheduled to meet his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki as
well as Iran’s top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, the state-
run Fars news agency reported.  
 Mottaki met with International Atomic Energy Agency
Director General Yukiya Amano and Austrian Foreign Minister
Michael Spindelegger yesterday in Vienna. Iran is meeting with
UN Security Council members to avert more sanctions over the
Persian Gulf country’s nuclear work.  
 “Security Council members have a very important decision to
make,” Mottaki said at a briefing in the Austrian capital.
“Sanctions would be an unfair, unjust punishment of an innocent
country.”  
 Amorim’s visit will also prepare a trip next month by
Brazil’s President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said, according to Fars. Besides
the meetings with officials from Austria and Brazil, which are
both security council members, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
recently travelled to Uganda, a third member of the body.  
 The U.S. and its European allies are pushing for a fourth
round of United Nations measures to stop what it says are
Iranian attempts to develop nuclear weapons. Iran rejects the
claim saying its nuclear program is purely civilian.
