             Cocoa rose to the highest price in
almost three months, extending the longest rally since October,
on signs of increasing demand and reduced supplies from Ivory
Coast, the world’s biggest producer. Coffee gained and orange
juice was unchanged.  
 From Oct. 1 to April 18, Ivory Coast farmers delivered
905,529 metric tons of cocoa beans to the country’s main ports,
a 2.8 percent drop from a year earlier, according to data from
the Bourse du Café et du Cacao. Global grindings, a sign of
demand, will be almost 3.6 million metric tons in the year
ending Sept. 30, up 3.3 percent from a year earlier, Fortis Bank
Nederland NV and VM Group said April 23.  
 “An increase in grindings and also a few concerns over
supplies from Ivory Coast” are boosting cocoa prices, said
Dennis Cajigas, a senior market strategist at broker Lind-
Waldock in Chicago. “We are looking at trying to pull our way
out of the recession. That’s also increasing aggregate demand
here in the longer term.”  
 Cocoa for July delivery rose $30, or 0.9 percent, to $3,228
a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after touching
$3,235, the highest level for a most-active contract since Jan.
29. The commodity’s five-session rally is the longest since the
eight sessions ended Oct. 22.  
 ‘Technical Buying’  
 “We’re just seeing some continued technical buying,
speculative and fund buying, as we continue to push to new
monthly highs here today,” said Boyd Cruel, a Vision Financial
Markets senior analyst in Chicago. “Funds trade on technicals.
As we put new highs in here, they’ve just been adding to their
positions.”  
 Should the July contract close above $3,235, the next
target would be $3,350 to $3,360, Cruel said.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, cocoa for May delivery rose 23
pounds, or 1 percent, to 2,328 pounds ($3,597) a ton. Earlier,
the price touched 2,334 pounds, within 16 pounds of the 21-year
high reached in January.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery rose 0.7 cent, or
0.5 percent, to $1.3265 a pound. The commodity has gained 11
percent in the past year.  
 Robusta coffee for July delivery fell $8, or 0.6 percent,
to $1,328 a ton in London.  
 Orange-juice futures for July delivery were unchanged at
$1.3695 a pound on ICE in New York. The price has advanced 6.1
percent this year.
