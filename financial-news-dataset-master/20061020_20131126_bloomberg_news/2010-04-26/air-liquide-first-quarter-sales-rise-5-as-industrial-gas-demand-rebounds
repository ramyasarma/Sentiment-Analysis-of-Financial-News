             Air Liquide SA, the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, said first-quarter sales rose 5.2
percent, bolstered by demand in emerging markets and a recovery
in electronics markets.  
 Revenue advanced to 3.15 billion euros ($4.21 billion) from
3 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said in
a statement today. The average estimate for sales in a Bloomberg
survey of 10 analysts was 3.08 billion euros.  
 “This first quarter of 2010 marks the return to growth,
especially in gas and services,” Chief Executive Officer Benoit
Potier said in the statement. “Barring a major economic upset,
Air Liquide expects continuous growth in net profit in 2010, in
line with its long-term performance.”  
 Air Liquide reiterated plans to cut costs by more than 200
million euros in 2010. The French supplier of oxygen to steel
plants and hospitals said its operating margin in the first
quarter was “slightly above” the 2009 average.  
 Revenue from gas and services rose 8.3 percent from a year
earlier to 2.75 billion euros, excluding the impact of
fluctuating currencies and natural gas. Other activities,
including specialty chemicals, rose 2.2 percent.
