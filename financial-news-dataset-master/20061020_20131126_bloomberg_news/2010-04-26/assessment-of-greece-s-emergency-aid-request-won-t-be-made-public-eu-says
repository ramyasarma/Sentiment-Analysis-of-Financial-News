             The European Union said it doesn’t
plan to publish its assessment of Greece’s request for emergency
financial aid from euro-area nations.  
 Greece last week asked to activate the funding facility,
which could provide as much as 45 billion euros ($60 billion) in
loans from the other 15 euro-region countries and the
International Monetary Fund. Disbursement of the euro-area
portion of the funds will be based on an assessment by the
European Central Bank and the European Commission, the EU’s
Brussels-based executive.  
 “That will be the basis of the decision by the
eurogroup,” the group of euro-area finance ministers, Amadeu
Altafaj, spokesman for EU Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner Olli Rehn, told reporters in Brussels today. “I
cannot tell you when this will take place.” Asked whether the
EU-ECB assessment will be made public after it is completed,
Altafaj said “no.”  
 Greek bonds tumbled today on concerns that any delay in the
aid package may trigger a further sell-off in the country’s
assets. More than 8 billion euros of Greek bonds mature on May
19. The yield on the nation’s two-year securities jumped 300
basis points to 13.96 percent.  
 Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou yesterday
expressed confidence that the talks on the EU-IMF package will
be “concluded rather soon” and said his country wouldn’t
restructure its debt.
