             Canadian wheat growers may cut
seeding by 5.1 percent this year, shifting some acres to canola,
according to a Statistics Canada survey.  
 Canada, the world’s second-largest exporter of wheat, will
see 23.2 million acres planted with the grain this year, down
from 24.5 million in 2009, the Ottawa-based statistics agency
said today. Spring wheat acreage is expected to rise 7.1 percent
to 18.1 million acres while durum planting may fall 35 percent
to 3.69 million acres.  
 Canola plantings are expected to increase 4.4 percent to a
record 16.9 million acres. Barley acres will probably fall 3.7
percent to 8.34 million, while plantings for oats are expected
to increase 7 percent to 3.99 million acres, Statistics Canada
said.  
 The agency’s survey covered 13,800 farmers and was taken
from March 24 to March 31.
