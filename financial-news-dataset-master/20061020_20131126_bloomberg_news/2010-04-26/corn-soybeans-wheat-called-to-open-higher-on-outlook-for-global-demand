             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that an
economic recovery will stimulate demand for food, animal feed
and fuel made from the biggest U.S. crop, said Christian Mayer,
a market analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents higher in
Chicago as cold weather threatens planting in China, the biggest
global consumer of the oilseed, increasing demand for imported
supplies, Mayer said. Soybean-meal futures may open $3 to $4
higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open
0.25 cent to 0.4 cent a pound higher, he said.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as Canadian farmers said they will plant less and
wet weather increases the risk of fungal disease for U.S. crops
in the southern Great Plains, Mayer said.
