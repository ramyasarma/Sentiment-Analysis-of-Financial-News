             Research In Motion Ltd., maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone, said China will account for a larger
share of revenue in 2010 than last year.  
 Chief Operating Officer Don Morrison didn’t give a figure
when he spoke with analysts today at a conference in Orlando,
Florida, where RIM introduced the BlackBerry Pearl 3G and the
BlackBerry Bold 9650.  
 Profit margins narrowed last quarter as the company moved
into China and other developing countries to counter slowing
growth in North America. The average price of a handset was $311
in the quarter and may fall as low as $305 this quarter, RIM
said last month. Co-Chief Executive Officer Jim Balsillie said
the new phones will raise the average selling price of RIM’s
handsets.  
 “You’re going to see ASP come up with new devices,”
Balsillie said at the conference.  
 Mobile phones accounted for 81 percent of the Waterloo,
Ontario-based company’s revenue for the year ended in February.  
 The shares rose 95 cents to $71.57 at 2:59 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
