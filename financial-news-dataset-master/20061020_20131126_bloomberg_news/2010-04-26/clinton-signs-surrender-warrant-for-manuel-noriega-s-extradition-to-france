             U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton has signed a surrender warrant for former Panamanian
dictator Manuel Noriega, an action that paves the way for his
extradition to France, Charles Luoma-Overstreet, a State
Department spokesman, said.  
 The U.S. Supreme Court had rejected an appeal from Noriega,
which led to the signing by Clinton.  
 Noriega was overthrown by the U.S. and brought to Miami to
face drug charges in 1990. He was convicted and completed his
sentence in 2007. While in a U.S. prison, Noriega was convicted
in France of money laundering. French officials say he will be
given a new trial if sent to that country.  
 Successive Panamanian governments have called on the U.S.
to extradite Noriega to stand trial in the Central American
nation, where he faces charges including the killing of army
officers.  
 Panama will respect the decision to extradite Noriega to
France and seek to prosecute him in Panamanian courts in “due
time,” Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Varela told reporters today
in Panama City.
