             Japanese stocks rose, sending the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to its biggest jump in nine weeks,
after a surge in U.S. new home sales and a weakening yen boosted
the earnings prospects for businesses reliant on overseas demand.  
 Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets 78 percent of its
sales outside Japan, climbed 3.5 percent. Toyota Motor Corp.
gained 3.4 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the carmaker
will probably report an annual operating profit, compared with
the company’s forecast for a loss. Komatsu Ltd., a machinery
maker that counts China as its fastest-growing market, advanced
4 percent after a newspaper reported China will announce a new
spending plan.  
 The Nikkei 225 jumped 2.3 percent to 11,165.79 in Tokyo.
The broader Topix index rose 1.9 percent to 996.71, with all but
one of its 33 industry groups advancing. Both gauges posted the
steepest gain since Feb. 22.  
 “The world’s economy is more resilient than has been
thought, and investors are more inclined to put their money in
stocks,” said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior strategist at Tokyo-
based Daiwa Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent
of $91 billion. “With the current foreign-exchange level,
investors are confident in the corporate earnings outlook.”  
 Last week, the Nikkei 225 and Topix had the biggest weekly
slump since the period ended Jan. 29, as China increased steps
to cool property prices, and a U.S. lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. raised concern bank regulation will increase.
Stocks in the Topix traded at 20 times estimated earnings, the
fourth-highest level globally, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Better Progress  
 Group of 20 finance chiefs, after meeting in Washington on
April 23, said the world’s economic recovery has “progressed
better than previously anticipated” and called for “credible”
plans to withdraw economic stimulus.  
 In New York, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.7
percent on April 23 to its highest close since September 2008.
Sales of new homes soared 27 percent in March, climbing the most
in 47 years to a level that surpassed the highest forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Orders for goods meant to
last at least three years, excluding cars and aircraft, gained
2.8 percent.  
 Canon, the world’s biggest digital-camera maker, climbed
3.5 percent to 4,395 yen. Sony Corp., an electronics maker that
gets 71 percent of its revenue outside Japan, gained 1.5 percent
to 3,295 yen. Electronics makers contributed the most to the
Topix’s gain, followed by automakers.  
 Toyota Climbs  
 “The U.S. economy is solidly improving because of not only
government spending, but also the recovery in private demand,”
said Tomochika Kitaoka, a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities
Co.  
 The yen depreciated against the dollar to 94.36 today from
93.43 at the 3 p.m. close of Tokyo stock trading on April 23,
and weakened versus the euro to 126.30 from 123.69. A weaker yen
boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  
 Toyota jumped 3.4 percent to 3,690 yen. The company will
probably report operating profit of as much as 50 billion yen
($530 million) for the year ended March 31, the Nikkei newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. That
compares with the company’s Feb. 4 forecast for an operating
loss of 20 billion yen. The company is scheduled to announce
results on May 11.  
 Advantest Corp., the world’s largest maker of memory-chip
testers, gained 3 percent to 2,476 yen. The company may post 1
billion yen in operating profit for the three months ended March
31, which would be its first quarterly earnings since the period
ended December 2007, the Nikkei said.  
 Komatsu, the world’s No. 2 maker of large dump trucks and
excavators, rose 4 percent to 1,882 yen. Hino Motors Ltd. jumped
6.3 percent to 439 yen, posting its biggest gain since Sept. 24.
The Nikkan Jidosha newspaper reported Hino expects a 23 percent
increase in unit sales this year because of China demand.  
 China will announce in August a new stimulus package of
possibly 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion), the China Business
newspaper reported on its Web site, citing unidentified sources.
