             BYD Co., the Chinese carmaker
backed by Warren Buffett, said first-quarter profit more than
tripled on higher demand for vehicles in the world’s biggest
automobile market.  
 Net income rose to 1.7 billion yuan ($249 million), or 0.75
yuan a share, from 480 million yuan, or 0.23 yuan, a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. Sales climbed 70 percent to 12.7 billion yuan.  
 BYD, the fastest growing Chinese automaker, boosted
deliveries in the first quarter as government incentives
supported demand for new cars. BYD’s F3 compact, which qualifies
for a tax break on vehicles with engine capacities of 1.6 liters
or smaller, was the best-selling model in the country during the
period.  
 BYD’s 2009 profit almost quadrupled to 3.79 billion yuan
after its unit sales surged 162 percent to 448,3978 units, the
Shenzhen-based company said in March.
