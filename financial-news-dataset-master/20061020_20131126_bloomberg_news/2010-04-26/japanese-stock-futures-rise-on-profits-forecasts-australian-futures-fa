             Japanese stock futures rose after
companies reported higher earnings or boosted forecasts, while
Australian futures fell as the price of crude oil dropped.  
 American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest maker of cameras and office equipment, finished 1.2
percent up from the Tokyo close yesterday after the company
raised its full-year profit forecasts. Komatsu Ltd., the world’s
second-largest maker of large dump trucks and excavators, gained
2.4 percent after earnings at its larger rival exceeded
analysts’ estimates. ADRs of Woodside Petroleum Ltd.,
Australia’s No. 2 producer of oil and gas, fell 0.2 percent.  
 “Earnings are improving faster than people expected,”
said Kenichi Hirano, general manager and strategist at Tokyo-
based Tachibana Securities Co.  
 Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
expiring in June closed at 11,175 yesterday in Chicago, 0.1
percent higher than 11,160 in Singapore. They were bid in the
pre-market at 11,170 as of 8:08 a.m. in Osaka, Japan. The Nikkei
225 closed at 11,165.79 yesterday.  
 Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.2 percent in Wellington.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.6 percent yesterday, its
biggest gain since March 17. Stocks in the index trade at 16.2
times estimated earnings, compared with 15.2 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 U.S. Stocks, Rules  
 Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed today. The index
fell 0.4 percent yesterday in New York as concern that proposed
legislation will hurt banks overshadowed improving earnings at
Caterpillar Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. Crude oil for June delivery
declined 1.1 percent to settle at $84.20, its first decline in
three days.  
 After markets closed, U.S. Senate Republicans blocked
Democrats from advancing their plan to overhaul Wall Street
regulation. No Republican broke ranks to join Democrats in the
57-41 vote, with 60 needed to begin consideration of the bill.  
 Canon said yesterday after Tokyo stock trading closed that
net income will probably be 240 billion yen ($2.55 billion) in
the year ending Dec. 31. The average of 20 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was for 228 billion yen.  
 Illinois-based Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of
earthmoving machinery, posted its first earnings increase in
seven quarters, exceeding analysts’ estimates, as the global
economy improved. The company also raised its full-year forecast.
