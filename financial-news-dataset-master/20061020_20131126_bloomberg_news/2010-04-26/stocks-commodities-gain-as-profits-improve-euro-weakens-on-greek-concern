             Stocks rose on improving corporate
earnings, while the dollar climbed and yields on the bonds of
Europe’s most indebted nations advanced amid concern Germany
will refuse early release of Greek rescue funds.  
 The MSCI World Index of 23 developed nations’ stocks rose
0.5 percent at 2:34 p.m. in New York as the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index surged 1.3 percent. Most U.S. stocks gained and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 percent to
11,234.58, even as declines in financial shares weighed on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The Dollar Index increased 0.2
percent, while 10-year Treasury yields were little changed at
3.81 percent. The extra yields demanded on 10-year Portuguese
and Greek bonds instead of German bunds climbed to records.  
 Even after the biggest rally since the 1930s, the S&P 500
started the day trading at 14.2 times forecasts for its
companies’ profits, lower than any time since 1990, excluding
the six months after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said she won’t release Greek rescue funds until the country
shows it’s got a “sustainable, credible” plan to cut its
budget deficit and a final decision may be in a “few days.”  
 “There are a number of companies that have reported very
strong earnings,” said Stanley Nabi, New York-based vice
chairman of Silvercrest Asset Management Group, which manages
$8.5 billion. “This has a very positive impact on the market.
There are several negative things going on, but it’s nothing
imminent.”  
 Earnings Season  
 Caterpillar Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. helped lead gains in
U.S. stocks today after reporting better-than-estimated
earnings. The S&P 500 has rallied 80 percent from a 12-year low
in March 2009 as the economy and corporate earnings returned to
growth following the financial crisis. The S&P 500 is up 9.2
percent for 2010, the largest gain in the world’s 15 biggest
equity markets, Bloomberg data show.  
 Earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies climbed 9.1
percent on average in April, twice the gain in their prices and
the largest monthly increase since at least 2006, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. About 80 percent of companies in the
benchmark gauge that have reported first-quarter earnings have
topped estimates.  
 Declines in financial shares limited the U.S. market’s
advance today, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. losing at least 1.7 percent, on concern proposed financial-
reform legislation will hurt banks. Citigroup Inc. sank 4.2
percent on the U.S. Treasury’s plan to sell “up to” 1.5
billion shares as the government exits its 27 percent ownership
of the bank.  
 European Stocks  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rallied 1 percent as shares of
raw-materials producers and banks advanced. BHP Billiton Ltd.,
the world’s largest mining company, rose 2 percent in London.
Julius Baer Group Ltd., the 120-year-old Swiss private bank,
climbed 1.8 percent in Zurich after Deutsche Bank AG advised
buying the shares. TomTom NV soared 9.8 percent in Amsterdam
after Europe’s biggest maker of portable navigation devices
reported an unexpected profit.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.6 percent, its
biggest gain in more than five weeks. Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, jumped 3.4 percent in Tokyo after the
Nikkei newspaper said the company had an annual operating profit
instead of the loss the company forecast. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. climbed 2.9 percent in Taipei.  
 Polish stocks helped lead gains in emerging markets as the
benchmark WIG 20 Index jumped 2.5 percent, the most in two
months, while the Budapest Stock Exchange Index rallied 2
percent after Hungarian voters returned Fidesz leader Viktor
Orban to power with 263 seats in the 386-strong parliament.  
 Greek Stocks  
 Investors demanded a record 2.18 percentage points more in
yield to hold Portuguese 10-year bonds instead of German bunds.
Greece’s yield premium jumped to 6.51 percentage points, the
highest since at least March 1998, according to Bloomberg
generic prices.  
 Credit-default swaps on Greece soared as much as 98.5 basis
points to a record 713 and Portugal jumped 39 basis points to an
all-time high of 318, spurring the Markit iTraxx SovX Western
Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments to 117 basis points,
according to CMA DataVision. Contracts on Spain climbed 10.5
basis points to 184 and Ireland increased 16.5 to 200.  
 The ASE Index of Greek equities dropped 2.9 percent.  
 Merkel, speaking to reporters in Berlin, said there will be
no decision on aid for Greece until the International Monetary
Fund works out a plan of cuts with Greece’s government. She said
Germany will assist Greece only after it agrees to take
“tough” measures for the next several years..  
 The euro slipped 0.8 percent compared with the pound and
0.4 percent versus the dollar. The pound advanced against 13 of
its 16 biggest peers as a report showed U.K. house prices rose
for a ninth month.  
 Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index slipped 0.3 percent.  
 Yields on Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts jumped
to a 13-month high as traders stepped up bets on this week’s
interest-rate increase after central bank President Henrique
Meirelles said that “vigorous action” is required to contain
inflation.  
 The yield on the contract due January 2011 soared seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 10.80 percent at 9:57
a.m. New York time, its highest level since March 6, 2009. The
real advanced 0.6 percent to 1.7454 per dollar, from 1.7565 on
April 23. The central bank’s monetary policy board starts its
two-day meeting tomorrow.  
 Copper for delivery in July advanced 0.5 percent to $3.548
a pound in New York. Palladium, used in auto catalysts and
jewelry, rose as high as $573.40 an ounce in London intraday
trading.
