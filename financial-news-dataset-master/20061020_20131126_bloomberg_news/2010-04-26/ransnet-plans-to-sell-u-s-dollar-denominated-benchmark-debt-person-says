             Transnet Ltd., the South African
state-owned transportation company, plans to sell U.S. dollar-
denominated debt in a benchmark offering, according to a person
familiar with the transaction.  
 Barclays Capital and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are joint
bookrunners for the offering, said the person, who declined to
be identified because terms aren’t set.  
 A benchmark offering is typically at least $500 million.
Transnet previously said in an e-mailed statement that it plans
to sell $2 billion of international debt to help fund
infrastructure spending.
