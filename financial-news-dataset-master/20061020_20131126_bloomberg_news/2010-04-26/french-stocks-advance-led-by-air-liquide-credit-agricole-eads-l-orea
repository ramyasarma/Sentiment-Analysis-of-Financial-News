             France’s CAC 40 Index rallied
46.09, or 1.2 percent, to 3,997.39 in Paris, gaining for a
second day. The SBF 120 Index increased 1.1 percent.  
 The following shares rose or fell in Paris. Stock symbols
are in parentheses.  
 Air Liquide SA (AI FP) advanced 1.7 percent to 89.86 euros,
gaining for a sixth day. The world’s biggest producer of
industrial gases said first-quarter sales rose 5.2 percent to
3.15 billion euros ($4.21 billion), bolstered by demand in
emerging markets and a recovery in electronics demand. The
average estimate for sales in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts
was 3.08 billion euros.  
 L’Oreal SA (OR FP) gained 1.8 percent to 83.16 euros,
climbing for a second day. Growth in Latin America, Eastern
Europe, and Asia markets will accelerate and a rebound in
department-store spending in the U.S. bodes well for luxury
brands, Investir reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Paul Agon.  
 Pierre & Vacances (VAC FP) jumped 5.6 percent to 63.04
euros, its biggest increase since June. Exane BNP raised its
recommendation on shares of the holiday-apartment company to
“outperform” from “neutral.”  
 Zodiac Aerospace (ZC FP) climbed 3.8 percent to 39.55
euros, its biggest increase since February. Kepler raised its
recommendation on the maker of aircraft seats and automotive
components to “buy” from “reduce.”
