             Corn prices in South Africa, the
largest producer of the grain on the continent, fell as a
forecast of rain in growing areas bolstered the prospects for
yields.  
 The South African Weather Service today forecast showers
and thunderstorms across the provinces of Mpumalanga, the
biggest producer of yellow corn, and Free State, where most of
the nation’s white-corn crop is grown.  
 White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg, fell 9
rand, or 0.8 percent, to 1,110 rand ($151) a metric ton. Meal
made from the grain is the country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for July delivery declined 5 rand, or 0.4
percent, to 1,189 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are among the
world’s biggest corn exporters.  
 Wheat for May delivery rose 7 rand, or 0.3 percent, to
2,225 rand a ton. South Africa is the continent’s fourth-largest
wheat grower, after Egypt, Morocco and Algeria.  
 The gains or losses for the most active contracts of the
following crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:
