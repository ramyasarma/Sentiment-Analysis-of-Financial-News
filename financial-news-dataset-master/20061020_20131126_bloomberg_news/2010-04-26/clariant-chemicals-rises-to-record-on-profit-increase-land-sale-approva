             Clariant Chemicals (India) Ltd., a
unit of the world’s biggest maker of printing-ink chemicals,
rose to a record after first-quarter profit rose 26 percent and
shareholders approved the sale of land in a Mumbai suburb.  
 Clariant rose 9.1 percent to 620.25 rupees, the highest
since at least January 1991, at the close of trading in Mumbai.  
 Net income rose to 325.3 million rupees ($7.3 million) in
the quarter ended March 31 from 258 million rupees year earlier,
the Mumbai-based company said in a statement to the Bombay Stock
Exchange on April 23. Net sales rose 18 percent to 2.23 billion
rupees.  
 The company has more than 100 acres of land in Thane, on
the outskirts of Mumbai. Of that, 36 acres will be sold shortly,
said Maulik Buch, a Mumbai-based analyst with Dacapo Brokerage
India Pvt., who rates the stock a “buy.”  
 “This is a hidden asset without any liabilities,” he said.  
 Clariant plans to invest 1 billion rupees in three years to
expand in India, Maulik said.  
 Muttenz, Switzerland-based Clariant AG said Feb. 16 it will
move its textile dyes and textile production from Switzerland to
locations in Asia.
