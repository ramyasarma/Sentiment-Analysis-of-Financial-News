             Ukraine may reach agreement with
Russia this summer on revised natural-gas transit terms,
Ukrainian Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Boyko said in a
interview televised yesterday by Ukraine broadcaster ICTV.  
 The Ukrainian government and state-run energy company NAK
Naftogaz Ukrainy are in talks with Russian gas exporter OAO
Gazprom about volumes of the fuel to be sent from Russia through
Ukraine, Boyko said in the interview.  
 The minister said Gazprom has cut prices of exports to
Ukraine, which means Naftogaz can pay for deliveries from its
own operating profit without funds from the state or the
International Monetary Fund.
