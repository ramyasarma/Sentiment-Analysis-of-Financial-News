             Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB (FEMSAUBD) ,
Latin America’s largest beverage company, said first-quarter
profit more than doubled on soft-drink sales and gains at its
retail unit.  
 Net income rose to 1.99 billion pesos ($164 million) from
804.2 million pesos a year earlier, Monterrey, Mexico-based
Femsa, as the company is known, said today in a  statement  on its
Web site. Sales climbed 6.2 percent to 46.1 billion pesos.  
 Femsa’s earnings before interest, depreciation and
amortization -- a measure of  cash flow  known as Ebitda -- rose
6.9 percent to 7.82 billion pesos.  
 Economic growth in Brazil and Argentina drove sales for
soft drinks. Sales at the soft-drink unit, Coca-Cola Femsa,
increased 4.7 percent to 23.6 billion pesos. Coca-Cola Femsa’s
sales in  Brazil  and Argentina rose 25 percent on higher prices
and an 11 percent increase in shipments.  
 Oxxo, the company’s convenience-store chain, had sales of
13.5 billion pesos, a 14 percent gain. Sales at the retail  unit 
were spurred by the opening of 950 new stores from a year ago.
The company had 7,492  convenience stores  at the end of March.  
 Femsa fell 33 centavos to 58.20 pesos in Mexico City
 trading  at 4:10 p.m.  New York  time. The shares have dropped 7.1
percent this year.  
 In Mexico, beer prices rose 9.8 percent on average,
countering a 6 percent drop in shipments to 5.52 million
hectoliters. Mexico beer revenue rose 3.2 percent to 6.58
billion pesos, while total beer revenue from Mexico, Brazil and
exports rose 3.8 percent to 9.58 billion pesos.  
 Beer Unit Sale  
 Femsa expects an agreement to sell its beer unit in
exchange for a 20 percent stake in  Heineken NV (HEIA)  to be completed
in the “next few days,” after its shareholders approved it
today, Chief Financial Officer Javier Astaburuaga said in a
conference call with analysts. Femsa valued the transaction at
$7.35 billion when it was announced in January. Most relevant
regulators and Heineken’s shareholders have approved the deal,
he said.  
 This is the final quarter in which the brewer will report
beer unit operating results in earnings. The company said
revenue would have been 38.1 billion pesos without the beer
unit, compared with 46.1 billion pesos with it, and that
operating income would have been 4.36 billion pesos compared
with 5.27 billion pesos with the beer business.  
 Femsa plans capital expenditures of $750 million this year,
Astaburuaga said, with $530 million earmarked for its soft-drink
unit and $220 million for the convenience-store chain.
