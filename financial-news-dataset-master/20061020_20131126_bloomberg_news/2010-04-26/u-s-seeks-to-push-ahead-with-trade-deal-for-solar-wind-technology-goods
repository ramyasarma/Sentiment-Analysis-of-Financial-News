             The U.S. is talking with Canada,
the European Union and Australia about eliminating tariffs on
solar, wind and related energy technologies to spur their use,
U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said today.  
 Kirk said the U.S. is seeking an “early harvest” for an
agreement on so-called green technologies, which means an
environmental deal wouldn’t have to wait for completion of the
Doha Round of World Trade Organization talks. Negotiations on
environmental goods have taken place since 2008.  
 “We think it only makes sense to make the trade of those
goods more open,” Kirk said at a Washington event on patent
protections. “We think it is important enough” that it could
move ahead on its own, he said.  
 The U.S. and EU in 2007 jointly proposed eliminating trade
barriers for 43 products ranging from thermostats to universal
joints for wind turbines to parts for boilers. The proposal also
called for easing investment rules for environmental services
and a longer-term, broader round of tariff cuts for other
environmental goods.  
 Total trade in such products topped $600 billion in 2006,
according to U.S. statistics.  
 Kirk didn’t say when he hopes to wrap up a deal on
environmental goods. President Barack Obama has made doubling
U.S. exports a top economic goal, and spurring trade in green
technologies could help accomplish that, according to Kirk.
