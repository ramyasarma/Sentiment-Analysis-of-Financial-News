             An Iraqi judicial panel ruled that
votes for 52 candidates who ran in the March 7 parliamentary
elections should be annulled, following claims by another body
that they were supporters of Saddam Hussein’s banned Baath
party, state-owned al-Iraqiya television reported.  
 The panel “issued a decision to cancel the candidacies of
52 people, discard their votes, and refrain from counting
them,” al-Iraqiya cited Ali Faisal al-Lami, head of the
Accountability and Justice Commission, which is tasked with
purging members of the Baath party from office, as saying today.  
 It wasn’t immediately clear whether some of the candidates
had won seats in the 325-member parliament or whether any
winners would be replaced. Hamdiya al-Husseini, a senior member
of the Independent High Electoral Commission, the main election
authority, said the 52 people would have one month to appeal the
decision, al-Iraqiya reported.  
 The Accountability and Justice Commission, which is run by
Shiite Muslims, successfully barred about 450 candidates from
the elections before the vote. Its request to blacklist another
52 people was deferred by the election panel until after the
count.
