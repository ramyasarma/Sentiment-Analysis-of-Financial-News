             Malaysian Prime Minister Najib
Razak’s ruling coalition won a by-election in the state of
Selangor, after losing six of the previous eight parliamentary
seats it has contested since the March 2008 general election.  
 The Hulu Selangor state seat was won by National Front
coalition candidate P. Kamalanathan, the official Bernama news
service reported, citing the Election Commission. He beat former
law minister Zaid Ibrahim from the Anwar Ibrahim-led People’s
Justice Party by 1,725 votes, it said.  
 “The ultimate test will actually be the general election,
but I am very encouraged by the support from the public,” the
prime minister told reporters today in Putrajaya, near Kuala
Lumpur. “We have to show more results, including proper
execution and implementation.”  
 Najib, who completed his first year as premier on April 3,
has eased investment rules and promised a revamp of the
country’s affirmative action policies in an effort to boost
outside investment. The platform has helped regain support for
the government in states such as Selangor, Malaysia’s richest
state by gross domestic product.  
 “The Malaysian public is translating their satisfaction
with the prime minister and the government into votes,” said
Ibrahim Suffian, director of the Merdeka Center, an independent
research institute based outside Kuala Lumpur.  
 Selangor came under opposition rule in the March 2008
general elections when the People’s Alliance won control of five
states, and gained a record number of parliamentary spots,
denying the National Front a two-thirds majority.  
 “One setback shall not divert us from our goal,” Anwar
said in a note to supporters today. “The economy is lagging,
jobs are scarce and our education system remains mediocre at
best.”  
 Zaid quit as law minister in 2008 in protest over the
arrest of a blogger, a journalist and a lawmaker under a
security act, which allows for indefinite detention without
trial. He was later removed from the United Malays National
Organisation, the biggest party in the National Front coalition.  
 The Hulu Selangor state seat fell vacant after the previous
state assemblyman, Zainal Abidin Ahmad, died of cancer last
month.
