             Hamburg fired coach Bruno Labbadia,
three days before the soccer team’s Europa League semifinal
second-leg game at English Premier League club Fulham.  
 The 44-year-old’s departure follows yesterday’s 5-1 defeat
at Hoffenheim that leaves Hamburg seventh in the Bundesliga and
out of the qualifying places for Europe next season. Ricardo
Moniz, a member of the coaching staff, will take charge for the
rest of this season, Hamburg said on its Web site.  
 Hamburg, which drew 0-0 at home with Fulham in the first
leg, would have to win the Europa League final in its own
stadium on May 12 to qualify for European competition in 2010-
11.  
 Labbadia, formerly at Bayer Leverkusen, was named as
Hamburg coach last June on a three-year contract after Martin
Jol left for Ajax.
