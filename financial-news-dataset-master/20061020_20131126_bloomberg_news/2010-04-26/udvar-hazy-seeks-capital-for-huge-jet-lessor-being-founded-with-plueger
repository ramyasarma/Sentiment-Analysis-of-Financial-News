             Steven Udvar-Hazy, who left
International Lease Finance Corp. in February, said he is
seeking capital for a “huge” new aircraft lessor, Air Lease
Corp., that he’s founding with former colleague John Plueger.  
 “We’re in a quiet period so I can’t talk, but it won’t be
much longer,” the 64-year-old Hungarian-born entrepreneur said
today in an interview during a conference in New York. “It’ll
be huge,” Udvar-Hazy said when asked how big the company will
be.  
 Udvar-Hazy built ILFC into the world’s largest plane lessor
and the biggest customer for Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS before
selling it to insurer American International Group Inc. in 1990.
He left as chief executive officer of his Los Angeles-based
company more than a year after it lost funding options because
of credit downgrades to AIG. Plueger, who was ILFC’s chief
operating officer at the time, replaced him temporarily as CEO
before leaving in March to rejoin Hazy.  
 Before 2008, a leasing company could have been started with
a 4-to-1 or 5-to-1 ratio of debt to equity, Udvar-Hazy said
today. Greater difficulty in obtaining credit in today’s climate
means that every dollar of equity invested in a new leasing
enterprise could expect to attract 2.5 times that in bank debt
or bonds, he said.  
 “The last financial nightmare taught us a lesson,” Udvar-
Hazy told a roomful of bankers, lessors, airline executives and
other aircraft finance executives at Euromoney’s Airfinance
conference. “In the heyday, you could stretch it to 4- or 5-1”
of debt to equity, he said. “Now it would be better to be 2.5
to 3-to-1.”
