             MetLife Inc. , which retains about
$10 billion of death benefits on behalf of families, said the
life insurance accounts being probed by New York Attorney
General  Andrew Cuomo  are popular with clients.  
 “The beneficiaries have full access to their funds,”
Chief Executive Officer  Robert Henrikson  said today in a
conference call with analysts. “Our accountholders tell us they
love it.”  
 Cuomo began a fraud investigation this week after a
Bloomberg Markets magazine report about how more than 100
companies including MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, earn
investment income on $28 billion owed to beneficiaries.
Henrikson joins  John Strangfeld , the CEO of No. 2 Prudential
Financial Inc., in saying that so-called retained-asset accounts
provide convenience to survivors.  
 “Beneficiaries are vulnerable targets for abusive sales
tactics,” Strangfeld said yesterday in a statement. “We believe
that the Alliance Account takes the pressure off beneficiaries
to do something with the money -- a situation that may lead to
imprudent and expensive investment decisions.”  
 Cuomo said that he had served subpoenas on New York-based
MetLife and Prudential, of Newark, New Jersey. He said his
office was demanding information about the difference in
interest income earned by the insurers and the rate paid to
beneficiaries. He is also seeking information about how and when
survivors are told about the conditions of the accounts.
Henrikson said today his company hadn’t yet received a subpoena.  
 ‘Full Access’  
 Cuomo’s office is also seeking information from  Genworth
Financial Inc. , Unum Group, New York Life Insurance Co.,
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co.,  Guardian Life Insurance
Co. of America and an insurer acquired by France’s Axa SA,
according to a person briefed on the demands.  
 “We are not aware of a subpoena, but we will certainly
cooperate in every way should we receive one,” said  Jim Sabourin , a spokesman for Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Unum. He
said the accounts serve clients well.  
 “Beneficiaries have full access to the money in their
retained-asset account and can withdraw the full amount right
away or at a later date. Moreover, retained assets are merely
one option for beneficiaries to receive a death benefit. Other
options include a lump sum or payment in a certain number
of installments,” Sabourin said.  
 MetLife’s Henrikson spoke today in a conference call to
discuss second-quarter results. The New York-based insurer said
late yesterday that  net income  was $1.56 billion in the three
months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $1.4 billion in
the year-earlier period. The company benefited from increased
revenue and an investment gain on derivatives.
