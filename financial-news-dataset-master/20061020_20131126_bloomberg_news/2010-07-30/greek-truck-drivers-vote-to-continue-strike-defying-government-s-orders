             Greek truck drivers voted to defy a
government order and continue their five-day strike, which has
caused nationwide fuel shortages, after talks with Transport
Ministry officials ended in deadlock.  
 “We are continuing with the strike,” George Tzortzatos,
president of the Truck Owners Confederation, said in comments
carried live today on state-run NET TV in Athens. “We didn’t
come here to mourn our licenses.”  
 Prime Minister  George Papandreou  ordered truckers to return
to work on July 28, given the “serious upheaval” to Greece’s
social and economic life in the middle of the key summer tourism
season. Authorities yesterday began serving papers requesting
truck owners to resume work or face penalties, including the
seizure of licenses or vehicles.  
 About 33,000 truckers, including tanker owners, are
protesting government plans to open up the freight industry and
issue new licenses. The changes are a requirement of a 110
billion-euro ($143 billion) loan package from the European Union
and the International Monetary Fund.  
 Papandreou said yesterday that the government would move
ahead with plans to open up professions such as trucking that
are bound by rules which prevent new entrants and drive up
prices. The government backs the plans because they will boost
growth potential, not because they’re part of the terms in the
loan package, he said.  
 Other professions to be revamped include civil engineers,
public notaries and pharmacists. No new licenses for trucking
have been issued since the early 1970s, according to the
Transport Ministry, which has driven up the price of acquiring
an existing license.  
 Truck owners and drivers “are giving their all not to lose
their property,” Tzortzatos said.
