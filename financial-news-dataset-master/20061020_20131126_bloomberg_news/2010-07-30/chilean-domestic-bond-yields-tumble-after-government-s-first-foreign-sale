             Chile’s bond yields and interest-
rate swap rates fell after the government sold its first
international peso bond at a lower yield than it pays to borrow
at home.  
 The yield on 10-year government bonds in pesos dropped 10
basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, the most in at least six
months, to 5.97 percent after the government sold similar debt
overseas at 5.5 percent. The 10-year swap rate in pesos dropped
six basis points to 5.58 percent as of 2:08 p.m. New York time.  
 Chile’s government yesterday sold $1 billion in dollar
bonds at 3.89 percent, the lowest yield in the country’s
history, as well as $520 million of the peso bonds, the first
such sale. Traders had trimmed yields on domestic bonds and
swaps since Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  announced marketing
for the bonds on July 22.  
 “Chilean fixed income is newly attractive after
yesterday’s bond placement, which reflects the strong appetite
of international investors for this kind of instrument,” said
 Aldo Lema , chief economist at Banco Security in Santiago. “We
have also seen a transitory effect in rates because activity
numbers from June, and especially industrial output, were
somewhat lower.”  
 Industrial output  grew less than forecast in June, even as
 unemployment  unexpectedly fell.  
 The 10-year swap rate has fallen 15 basis points from 5.73
percent on July 22 and the 10-year bond yield declined 38 basis
points from 6.34 percent. Swap rates, which reflect views of the
likely average of future borrowing costs, had risen after the
central bank lifted its benchmark rate by half a percentage
point for a second consecutive month on July 15.  
 U.S. Growth  
 Investors should bet that the one-year rate drops back to
3.1 percent, from today’s 3.47 percent, because mixed economic
data and risks to U.S. growth may slow central bank rate rises
after August,  Diego Donadio , a strategist at BNP Paribas in Sao
Paulo wrote today in a note to clients.  
 The one-year rate has slid since reaching a 17-month high
of 3.54 percent on July 22.  
 Chile’s peso strengthened 0.4 percent to 521.25 per dollar
from 523.55 yesterday. The peso appreciated 4.8 percent in July,
more than other Latin American currency tracked by Bloomberg as
investors increased their appetite for risky assets and copper,
Chile’s biggest export, rallied 12 percent in London.  
 Chilean industrial output grew 2.9 percent in June from a
year earlier, the National Statistics Institute said July 28,
less than the 5.3 percent median forecast of 12 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Unemployment slid to 8.5 percent in the three months
through June from 8.8 percent in the three months through May,
the Institute said today. The median estimate of 11 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a rise in the rate to 8.9 percent.
