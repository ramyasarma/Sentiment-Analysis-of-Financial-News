             Nomura Holdings Inc., one of the 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve, said policy
makers will “ease” at their Aug. 10 meeting, though what form
it takes is debatable.  
 Central bankers may change the language of their policy
statement to signal that the Fed’s balance sheet will remain
expanded and change policy on the mortgage program to start
reinvesting paydowns, the firm said in a note to clients today.
There is also a chance of other actions, such as a cut in the
rate on excess reserves, Nomura’s global economics team said.  
 Nomura changed its viewpoint because of a softening of the
comments from policy makers such as Philadelphia Fed President
 Charles Plosser  and St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard . The
firm also cited the Fed’s downward revision for growth and the
slack in the economy that threatens to push inflation to an
unacceptably low level for Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  
 “Easing is going to be very seriously considered given
several months of disappointing data and the very dovish tone of
public commentary across the spectrum,” said  Zach Pandl,  an
economist at Nomura Securities International in New York. “If
the Fed is averse to buying more assets, then cutting the rates
of interest on reserves could be the next option.”  
 Bullard said yesterday that the central bank should resume
purchases of Treasury securities if the economy slows and prices
fall rather than maintain a pledge to keep rates near zero.  
 ‘Lower for Longer’  
 The Fed signaled last month that Europe’s debt crisis may
harm U.S. growth and repeated a pledge to keep interest rates
near zero “for an extended period.” The central bank cut the
benchmark interest  rate  almost to zero in December 2008 and
turned to purchases of Treasury, housing-agency and mortgage-
backed securities as the main tool for monetary policy.  
 “The main effect would be to change expectations about
where policy is headed,” Pandl said. “It will be more ‘lower
for longer.’ It will be to lower market expectations for
tightening in the next year. The shift would affect those
expectations.”
