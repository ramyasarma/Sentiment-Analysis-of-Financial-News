             U.S. funding for transportation
projects such as Amtrak passenger rail, highway building and
transit would rise almost 5 percent to $79.4 billion next year
as part of a spending  plan  passed today by the U.S. House.  
 Highway construction funds would increase 10 percent to
$45.2 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 from $41.1
billion, under the legislation approved 251-167.  
 The Amtrak rail subsidy would jump 13 percent to $1.77
billion, and transit aid would increase 5 percent to $11.3
billion. The  Federal Aviation Administration  budget would climb
6 percent to $16.5 billion.  
 The bill “will put people in America back to work,” said
Representative  Carolyn Kilpatrick , a Michigan Democrat, before
the vote. “Our crumbling roads and bridges can be fixed.”  
 An increase in spending, if passed by the Senate, would
boost companies such as equipment maker  Caterpillar Inc. , gravel
supplier Vulcan Materials Co., railcar-manufacturer Bombardier
Inc. and locomotive producer  General Electric Co.   
 The full Senate hasn’t acted on its transportation spending
plan. Differences between the bills would have to be resolved
before being sent to President  Barack Obama  for his signature.  
 High-speed rail, an Obama priority, would get $1.4 billion,
less than the $2.5 billion spent last year and more than the $1
billion the president sought.  
 Funding for the  National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration , which has faced questions from lawmakers over
its handling of  Toyota Motor Corp.  recalls, would increase 3
percent to $883 million, a larger boost than Obama sought.  
 The FAA’s operating budget would rise 4.7 percent to $9.79
billion. The increase covers costs for a new air-traffic
controller contract that began Oct. 1, giving employees 3
percent annual raises over three years. FAA spending on
equipment would increase 2.2 percent to $3 billion.  
 The bill is H.R. 5850.
