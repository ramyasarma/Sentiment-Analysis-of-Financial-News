             Lehman Brothers Treasury Co. BV’s
bankruptcy trustees rejected the proposed reduction of their
intercompany claims in the U.S. plan filed by  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. , the bankrupt investment bank.  
 The plan “proposes a 50 percent reduction of the
intercompany claim filed by bankruptcy trustees in the Chapter
11 proceedings of” the Lehman holding company, Rutger J.
Schimmelpenninck and Frederic Verhoeven, lawyers at Houthoff
Buruma, wrote in their sixth public bankruptcy  report . The
trustees said in today’s filing in Amsterdam district court that
they disagree with the proposed reduction and are discussing
better treatment of the claim.  
 The Lehman Brothers Treasury unit financed the business
activities of affiliates of New York-based Lehman, in bankruptcy
since 2008, by selling financial instruments including
structured notes, the trustees said. The  Lehman  holding company
owed $33.2 billion to Lehman Brothers Treasury as of Sept. 12,
2008, they said.  
 The balance of the unit’s estate accounts was 7.74 million
euros ($10.1 million) at the end of June, the trustees said.
