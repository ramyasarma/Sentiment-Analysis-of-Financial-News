             Corporacion Mexicana de Aviacion SA
said lessor Air Canada seized two aircraft after a
“misunderstanding” and a report that the Mexican carrier may
file for bankruptcy.  
 The differences with Air Canada have since been resolved
and all flights are operating normally, Armando Vera, a
spokesman for Mexicana, said yesterday without elaboration. The
airline earlier canceled two flights from Montreal and Calgary,
Canada to Mexico City.  
 The flights were canceled after a creditor asked Canadian
authorities to take grounding actions to clarify “rumors”
about the company’s debts, the airline said. El Universal
newspaper  reported  yesterday that the carrier told unions
representing pilots and flight attendants that it’s considering
filing for bankruptcy, a sale to the unions or a restructuring
plan.  
 Vera said he couldn’t comment on the airline’s financial
situation. Mexicana’s shareholders are scheduled to meet today,
he said.  Isabelle Arthur , a spokeswoman for  Air Canada , didn’t
return phone and e-mail messages yesterday after normal business
hours.  
 The government had no role in the matter,  Transport Canada 
said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  
 Passengers on the canceled flights were transferred to
other services.
