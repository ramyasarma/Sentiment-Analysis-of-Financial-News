             Mexican authorities arrested four
prison workers in the northern state of Durango for allegedly
letting prisoners out of their cells to commit crimes, the
attorney general’s office said in a statement.  
 The former director of the jail in the city of Gomez
Palacio was among the detained, the statement said.  
 In northern Torreon, Coahuila state, some of the prisoners
stormed into a party July 18 and opened fire, killing 17 people,
the attorney general said in a previous statement. Coahuila
state shares a border with Durango.
