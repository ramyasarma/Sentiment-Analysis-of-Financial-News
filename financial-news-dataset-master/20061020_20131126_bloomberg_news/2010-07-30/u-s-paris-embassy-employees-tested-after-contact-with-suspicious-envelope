             The U.S. embassy in Paris said it
received a “supicious” envelope today, and that two of its
employees exposed to it are undergoing medical tests.  
 Early results indicate that the envelope is not harmful,
said the embassy’s deputy spokeswoman Elizabeth Detmeister.  
 The envelope had passed through the embassy’s mobile-testing
unit, permanently installed at the facility, she said.
