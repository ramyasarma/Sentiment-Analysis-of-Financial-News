             Volkswagen AG’s  Audi luxury division
said its first-half profit surged 46 percent as the Q5 sport-
utility vehicle and A8 sedan won buyers in China and the U.S.  
 Net income at the most profitable of VW’s nine group brands
was 978 million euros ($1.3 billion), compared with 671 million
euros a year earlier, Ingolstadt, Germany-based Audi said today
in an e-mailed statement. Audi is targeting record sales of more
than 1.08 million cars and SUVs in 2010, an increase of 14
percent from a year earlier.  
 Audi, which sold 554,939 cars and SUVs in the first six
months, has a goal of dethroning  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  as
the world’s largest maker of luxury cars by 2015. BMW,  Daimler
AG’s  Mercedes-Benz and Audi have boosted sales this year on
surging demand in China, the world’s largest auto market, and a
rebound in the U.S.  
 Audi is targeting a  return on capital  in 2020 of more than
18 percent and a pretax profit margin of more than 8 percent of
sales, the company said on May 20. Audi’s forecast compares with
a “sound single-digit percentage” sales gain targeted by  BMW 
and Mercedes-Benz’s plan to outpace market growth of 4 percent.  
 First-half sales of the Q5 increased 52 percent to 74,219
units while A8 deliveries more than doubled to 9,535 cars.  
 Audi contributed 1.33 billion euros to Volkswagen’s first-
half group operating profit of 2.84 billion euros. Wolfsburg,
Germany-based  Volkswagen , Europe’s biggest carmaker, aims to
overtake Toyota Motor Corp. in deliveries and profitability by
2018, and it’s targeting a second consecutive year of record
sales in 2010.  
 The unit aims to introduce a dozen models this year,
including the A1, Audi’s smallest vehicle, and a coupe dubbed 
the A7, as it increases the lineup to 42 vehicles by 2015 from 
34 in 2009. Audi also has a 7.3 billion-euro budget to upgrade
factories and develop new cars through 2012. Audi is targeting a
goal of selling 1.5 million vehicles by 2015.
