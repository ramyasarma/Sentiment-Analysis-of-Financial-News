             Wacker Chemie AG , the world’s
second-largest maker of chemicals for production of solar
modules and microchips, raised its  outlook  for annual sales
following a recovery in demand for silicone used in electronics
and cars.  
 Sales will total about 4.5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in
2010, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or  EBITDA , should exceed 2008’s record level of
1.06 billion euros. Wacker had previously guided for sales to
increase to above 4 billion euros, and Ebitda to “grow
significantly.”  
 Wacker, whose products are used in the production of
modules to generate solar power, is benefitting from rising
demand for renewable energy as well as from a recovery in the
electronics industry. Chipmakers including Intel Corp., Samsung
Electronics Co., and Taiwan Semiconductor, posted record profits
from semiconductors as the global economy rebounds and consumers
in emerging markets buy more electronic devices.  
 Net income in the second quarter totaled 135.4 million
euros compared with a 74.5 million-euro loss in the year-earlier
period. Sales rose to a record 1.2 billion euros, also helped by
a stronger  U.S. dollar .  
 Wacker  shares  have gained 34 percent in the past six
months, rising faster than Germany’s MDAX benchmark index for
medium-sized companies at 12 percent, for a market value of 6.65
billion euros.  
 The Munich-based company is controlled by the family of
 Peter-Alexander Wacker , chairman of the supervisory board and
great grandson to Alexander Wacker, who founded the company in
1914.
