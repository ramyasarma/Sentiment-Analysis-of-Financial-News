             The Texas Rangers, the bankrupt
Major League Baseball team, got an “enhanced” bid from a buyer
group led by  Nolan Ryan  and  Chuck Greenberg  that was endorsed by
the club’s court-appointed chief restructuring officer.  
 The deal with the Greenberg-Ryan group would require the
court to cancel an auction of the team scheduled for next week,
 William Snyder , the restructuring officer, said at hearing today
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Fort Worth, Texas. Snyder said he
favored the new offer because it removes the uncertainty of an
auction.  
 “It’s a fair price with a certain outcome,” he told U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge D.  Michael Lynn . Snyder didn’t give details of
the new offer.  
 The team was scheduled to go up for auction Aug. 4 with the
Greenberg-Ryan group leading the bidding. Lenders opposed to the
terms of the auction have agreed to provide financing to  Mark Cuban , owner of the National Basketball Association’s Dallas
Mavericks, the lenders’ lawyer said today.  
 Clifton Jessup , an attorney for Cuban, told the judge his
client is ready to bid in the auction.  
 “We have money,” Jessup said. Selling without an auction
“is not fair and is not reasonable and smacks of collusion,” he
said.  
 The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth).
