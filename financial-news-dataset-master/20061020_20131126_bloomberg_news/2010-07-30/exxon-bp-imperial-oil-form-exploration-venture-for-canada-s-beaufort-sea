             Imperial Oil Ltd. ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. 
and  BP Plc  formed a joint venture to explore for oil and natural
gas in Canada’s Beaufort Sea.  
 Imperial and Exxon will each hold a 25 percent stake in the
venture, and BP will own 50 percent, Imperial spokesman  Pius Rolheiser  said by phone from Calgary today.  
 The two licenses involved are exploration license 446,
bought by Imperial and Exxon in 2007, and exploration license
449, awarded to London-based BP in 2008, Rolheiser said.  
 Exxon Mobil and other producers have discovered more than
10 billion barrels of oil in North American arctic seas. The
reserves remain locked beneath the seafloor because of a lack of
pipeline capacity to ship them to markets.
