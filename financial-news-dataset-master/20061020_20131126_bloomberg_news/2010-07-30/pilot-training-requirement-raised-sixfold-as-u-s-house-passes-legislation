             The U.S. Senate cleared and sent to
President  Barack Obama  legislation that would increase by
sixfold the minimum experience pilots need to work at airlines
in response to a commuter-plane crash.  
 The requirement that pilots have 1,500 hours of flight
time, surpassing the current 250-hour minimum, was sought by
pilot unions and relatives of victims in a deadly February 2009
crash near Buffalo, New York. The House passed the bill
yesterday.  
 The National Transportation Safety Board said this year
that Captain Marvin Renslow of  Pinnacle Airlines Corp .’s Colgan
unit caused his plane to crash near Buffalo, killing 50 people,
by incorrectly responding to a stall warning in the cockpit. He
died along with all passengers, crew and a person on the ground.  
 “We are taking long overdue action,” said Senator Byron
Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, in a statement. “The flying
public can truly expect one high level of safety in our skies.”  
 The legislation, which passed both chambers by voice vote,
would require that the Federal Aviation Administration ensure
pilots have been trained in stall recovery and would force
airlines to take steps to assure that pilots aren’t flying when
they are tired.  
 The pilot-safety bill also extends through September the
law authorizing financing for the FAA. Without action by Aug. 1,
taxes that support the agency would expire. While the FAA
authorization in the measure would be temporary, the safety
provisions would be permanent.  
 ‘Strongest Safety Bill’  
 “We can no longer delay in enacting the strongest safety
bill in decades,” said Representative  Jerry Costello , an
Illinois Democrat, before the House vote.  
 House and Senate lawmakers are putting off for now
resolving disagreements that have stalled a longer-term FAA
bill. Legislators are at odds over raising passenger ticket fees
that fund airports and enacting a provision that would make it
easier for ground workers at  FedEx Corp. ’s Express unit to form
unions.  
 Congress is almost three years overdue in renewing the FAA
authorization. The agency has been operating on temporary
renewals while lawmakers negotiate.  
 The measure is H.R. 5900.
