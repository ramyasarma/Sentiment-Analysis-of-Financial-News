             Ellen DeGeneres  will leave
“American Idol,” the Fox talent show that has dominated U.S.
ratings for seven years, after being a judge for one season.  
 “This didn’t feel like the right fit for me,” DeGeneres
said today in a statement e-mailed by the  News Corp.  broadcast
network. “While I love discovering, supporting and nurturing
young talent, it was hard for me to judge people and sometimes
hurt their feelings.”  
 DeGeneres’s departure comes amid other changes at the show,
which saw ratings drop about 9 percent last season and is losing
sharp-tongued judge  Simon Cowell  to a new talent contest on Fox.
The network has talked to  Nigel Lythgoe  about returning as
executive producer of “Idol,” the New York Times reported on
July 27.  
 “We love Ellen and understand and support her decision to
bow out,”  Peter Rice , entertainment chairman at Fox Networks,
said in the statement.  
 News Corp., the New York-based media company controlled by
 Rupert Murdoch , lost 2 cents to $12.96 today in Nasdaq Stock
Market  trading  and has fallen 5.3 percent this year.  
 “American Idol” was the most-watched prime-time program
in the broadcast TV season that ended in May. The twice-weekly
talent contest averaged 24.9 million viewers on Tuesday nights
and 23.7 million on Wednesday nights. The show was also the most
popular program among the 18-to-49 year-old viewers that
advertisers target.  
 Cowell said in January he would leave “Idol” to host a
U.S. version of the music competition “X Factor,” which he
created in the U.K. He will be an executive producer and a
judge.  
 Fox hasn’t announced a replacement for Cowell. TV networks
are previewing shows at the Television Critics Association in
Beverly Hills, California. Fox’s presentation is Aug. 2.
