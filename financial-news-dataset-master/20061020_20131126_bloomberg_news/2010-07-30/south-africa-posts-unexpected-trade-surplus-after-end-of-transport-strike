             South Africa unexpectedly posted a
trade surplus in June, the biggest since December 2003, as the
country’s ports cleared a backlog in exports after a strike at
state transport company Transnet Ltd. ended.  
 The surplus of 5.6 billion rand ($762 million) followed a
302 million rand deficit in May, the South African Revenue
Service said in an e-mailed statement today. The median estimate
of 12 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for a 1.6 billion
rand deficit.  
 The surplus “was partly due to postponed merchandise
trading activities” as a result of the 18-day Transnet strike in
May, the revenue services said. “Positive growth in seasonal
exports in the citrus industry” also contributed.  
 Exports swelled 18 percent to 55.56 billion rand in June
from the previous month, as shipments of vegetable products
surged 92 percent and exports of base metals rose 45 percent,
the revenue service said. Exports of prepared foodstuffs,
beverages and tobacco increased 78 percent.  
 Imports climbed 5.2 percent to 49.93 billion rand, with
purchases of textiles rising 37 percent and machinery and
electrical appliances 8 percent, the Revenue Service said.
Imports of vehicles, aircraft and boats fell 23 percent.  
 Trade figures are often volatile, reflecting the timing of
shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.
