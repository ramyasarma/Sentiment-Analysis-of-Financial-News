             Total Nigeria Plc was downgraded to
“underperform” from “neutral” by CSL Stockbrokers Ltd. after
the fuel company’s second-quarter sales missed CSL’s estimate by
6 percent.  
 “It appears that the recent introduction of the sovereign
debt-note programme by the federal government for importers 
did not provide as much of an uplift as we had expected and that
seasonality effects such as weather may have also weighed on the
results,” Lagos-based analysts Gbenga Sholotan and Olubunmi
Asaolu wrote in a note to clients dated today.
