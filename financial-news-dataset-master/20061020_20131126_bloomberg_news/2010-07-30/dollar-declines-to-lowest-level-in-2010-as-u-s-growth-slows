             The dollar touched a level below
86 yen for the first time this year and had a third straight
monthly loss against Japan’s currency as a government report
showed U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter.  
 The yen advanced to a one-week high versus the euro as
investors sought refuge after Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said yesterday the U.S. is moving closer
to Japanese-style deflation.  
 “The dollar has been on a sharp downturn in July,” said
 Jens Nordvig , a managing director of currency research in New
York at Nomura Holdings Inc. “The key catalyst for the dollar
would be a situation where the Fed moves clearly in a more
dovish direction.”  
 The greenback dropped 0.4 percent to 86.41 yen at 4:05 p.m.
in New York, from 86.79 yesterday, after reaching 85.95, the
lowest level since Nov. 30. Japan’s currency gained 0.8 percent
to 112.64 per euro, from 113.51, after earlier touching 112.03,
the strongest level since July 23. The dollar appreciated 0.4
percent to $1.3034 per euro, from $1.3079.  
 Canada’s dollar rose versus all of its major counterparts
as investors speculated that the Bank of Canada will extend
increases in the target lending rate even after a government
report showed the nation’s economy grew 0.1 percent in May, a
slower pace than analysts forecast.  
 The loonie, as the currency is also known, appreciated 0.9
percent to C$1.0279. It touched C$1.0256 on July 27, the
strongest level since June 22.  
 Slower Growth  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
second quarter after a revised 3.7 percent increase in the first
three months of the year, the Commerce Department reported
today. The median forecast of 81 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a gain of 2.6 percent.  
 “Those who think we need additional stimulus for the
economy will be bolstered by the decline from the first quarter
to the second quarter,” said  Andrew Busch , a global currency
strategist at Bank of Montreal in Chicago.  
 The worst U.S. economic recession since the 1930s was
deeper than previously estimated, according to revised Commerce
Department figures. The economy shrank 4.1 percent from the
fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, compared
with the previous estimate of 3.7 percent.  
 The greenback pared its drop versus the yen today after the
Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its business
barometer rose to 62.3 this month, more than the median forecast
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Figures greater than
50 signal expansion.  
 Dollar in July  
 The dollar fell against all of its major counterparts in
July, dropping 2.3 percent against the yen. It slid 6.2 percent
versus the euro, while the yen lost 3.9 percent.  
 The Fed should resume purchases of Treasury securities if
the economy slows and prices fall, Bullard said in a research
paper released yesterday. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on July 21 that
“the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain.”  
 The central bank said in its statement at the conclusion of
its June policy meeting that “financial conditions have become
less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely
reflecting developments abroad.”  The Fed is next scheduled to
release a policy decision on Aug. 10.  
 “The market is reacting in a risk-averse way since James
Bullard’s comments yesterday,” said  Jack Spitz , managing
director of foreign exchange at National Bank of Canada in
Toronto. “This noted hawk has reversed his position and
suggests quantitative-easing measures may be required to combat
what he sees as deflation risks.”  
 Yen in 2010  
 The yen has advanced 11 percent this year in the biggest
gain among developed-world counterparts, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indices. The euro has dropped 8
percent, while the dollar is up 2 percent.  
 Japan’s  factory   output  slid 1.5 percent in June from the
previous month, when it gained 0.1 percent, the government said.
The yen typically strengthens in times of uncertainty because
Japan’s trade surplus means the nation doesn’t have to rely on
overseas lenders.  
 The euro pared its biggest monthly increase versus the
dollar since May 2009 as the currency failed to break through
resistance, triggering selling, according to Danske Bank A/S.  
 The currency was unable to rally past $1.3125, the 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $1.5144 on
November 2009 to $1.1877 last month, according to  John Hydeskov ,
senior currency analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.  
 The euro gained 1 percent this week versus the dollar after
the Committee of European Banking Supervisors said July 23 that
only 7 of 91 European Union banks failed stress tests.  
 Spain, with the region’s highest unemployment rate at 20
percent, will probably lose its top Aaa credit rating,  Steven A. Hess , senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service, said
yesterday in an interview in Sydney. The rating company put the
nation under review for possible downgrade in June.
