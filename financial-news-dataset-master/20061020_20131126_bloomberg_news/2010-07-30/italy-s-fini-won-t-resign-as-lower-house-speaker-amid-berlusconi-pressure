             Gianfranco Fini today said he will
not resign as a speaker of the lower house of parliament,
resisting calls by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.  
 Fini, who co-founded the ruling People of Liberty party
with Berlusconi, spoke in a news conference in Rome. He did not
take questions.
