             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from non-payment increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 3.5 basis points to
117 basis points as of 8:41 a.m. in Hong Kong, the highest since
July 26, according to Credit Agricole CIB and CMA prices.  
 The Markit iTraxx Japan index added 1 basis point to 116
basis points as of 9:34 a.m. in Tokyo, also the most since July
26, Morgan Stanley and CMA prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia
index of 50 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan increased
3.5 basis points to 118 basis points as of 8:41 a.m. in Hong
Kong, according to Credit Agricole CIB prices.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
