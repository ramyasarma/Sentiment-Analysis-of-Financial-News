             The euro’s rally against the dollar
may slow as investors use its first monthly gain in more than a
year to bank profits from investing in the currency, according
to Citigroup Inc.  
 “Ongoing evidence of cyclical divergence, and a resulting
wedge in the monetary policy stance, will likely support euro-
dollar in the short term,”  Michael Hart , a currency strategist
in London, wrote in a note to clients today. “However,
following the rapid move over the past two months and the
position adjustment, we expect the rally to take a breather.”  
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.3009 as of 12:05 p.m. in
London. The euro has surged 6.1 percent against the dollar this
month, the biggest gain since May 2009.
