             PKO Bank Polski SA and insurer PZU
SA are among “strategic” companies in which the government may
reduce its stakes to around 25 percent to help finance the
budget deficit, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said at a news
conference in Warsaw today.  
 The government has no plans to sell further shares in
copper producer KGHM Polska Miedz SA, Tusk said after the
government’s meeting on a four-year fiscal plan.
