             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB  Index
declined for a second day this week, falling 75.41, or 0.4
percent, to 21,021.56 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan. The gauge
increased 2 percent this week and 8.9 percent this month.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Autogrill SpA  (AGL IM) declined 14.5 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to 9.5 euros, a fifth straight loss. The world’s biggest manager
of airport and highway restaurants said in a statement that
second-quarter net income fell to 32.6 million euros versus 38.1
million euros a year earlier.  
 Banca Generali SpA  (BGN IM) rose 9.5 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to 8.54 euros after saying profit in the first half almost
doubled to 43.7 million euros from 23.9 million euros a year
earlier as a jump in commissions more than offset a decline in
lending income.  
 Bulgari SpA  (BUL IM) sank 26.5 cents, or 4.2 percent, to
6.02 euros, taking this week’s loss to 7.3 euros. The world’s
third-largest jeweler reported second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates on declining sales in Europe, and confirmed
its full-year revenue forecast of at least 5 percent growth.  
 “Even though management confirms its sales growth and EBIT
guidance, we do not rule out that the market could be
disappointed by the lack of good surprises,” Kepler Capital
Markets said in a note.  
 Enel SpA  (ENEL IM) rose for a second day, gaining 3.75
cents, or 1 percent, to 3.77 euros. Natixis Securities lifted
its recommendation to “neutral” from “reduce,” on management
confirming guidance on operating profit and debt reduction and
because the “share price appears to have reached a floor.”  
 The country’s largest utility posted a 31 percent decline
in first-half profit as a gain linked to the purchase of a stake
in Spanish power company Endesa SA wasn’t repeated. Enel will
meet its 2010 debt target and the initial public offering of its
Green Power unit is still targeted for October, Chief Executive
Officer Fulvio Conti said.  
 FastWeb SpA  (FWB IM) lost 34 cents, or 2.8 percent, to
11.76 euros, a second consecutive decline. Deutsche Bank AG
downgraded the telecommunications company to “hold” from
“buy,” because of “disappointing results.”  
 Fastweb also had its recommendation cut to “reduce” from
“hold” at Banca Akros.  
 Italcementi SpA  (IT IM), Italy’s biggest cement maker, sank
19.5 cents, or 3 percent, to 6.28 euros. Construction stocks
were the worst performers in Europe today. Lafarge SA, the
world’s biggest cement maker, said second-quarter profit fell 15
percent and pledged to extend costs cuts and asset sales to
reduce its debt as it trimmed its forecast for demand in 2010.  
 Italcementi reported second-quarter net income of 37.9
million euros. The company didn’t provide a comparable figure
for the year earlier period.  
 Mediaset SpA  (MS IM) dropped for a third day, losing 7.25
cents, or 1.5 percent, to 4.93 euros. Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi’s television broadcaster had its price estimate
lowered to 4.9 euros from 5.1 euros at Natixis Securities, which
reiterated a “reduce” rating.  
 Parmalat SpA  (PLT IM) plummeted 6.3 cents, or 3.3 percent,
to 1.86 euros, the biggest loss since May 7. Cheuvreux removed
Italy’s biggest dairy food company from its “selected list”
and downgraded the stock to “underperform.” The brokerage
noted that “despite the better currency trend, the guidance is
unchanged,” due to “risks in Italy and Venezuela.”  
 Telecom Italia SpA  (TIT IM) declined 2.95 cents, or 2.9
percent, to 97.75 cents, snapping a four-day increase. Cheuvreux
reiterated a “sell” recommendation on Italy’s biggest phone
company and suggested “to short Telecom Italia compared with
the European telecom index ahead of second-quarter results.”  
 “Telecom Italia’s strategy remains ineffective as it is
hampered by the shareholding structure and debt burden,” the
brokerage said in a note.  
 Zignago Vetro SpA  (ZV IM) climbed 20.25 cents, or 4.9
percent, to 4.36 euros, the steepest increase since Dec. 11.
Equita Sim SpA upgraded the specialist bottle maker to “buy”
and added the stock to its “small cap portfolio.”
