             Cotton rose to a one-month high as
the lowest stockpiles since 2004 in the U.S., the world’s
largest exporter, signal textile makers are buying now rather
than waiting for the next crop. Orange-juice futures gained.  
 Cotton  inventories  monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have
plummeted 96 percent since June 2 to 47,571 bales on July 29,
the lowest level since December 2004. While the government
forecasts a 50 percent jump in U.S.  production  this year, most
farmers won’t start harvesting until October.  
 “You’re hard-pressed to find cotton right now, and this is
very unusual, historically,” said  Peter Egli , the director of
risk management in Chicago for Plexus Cotton Ltd., a U.K.-based
merchant. “The market is trying to figure out when we will
finally have enough cotton.”  
 Cotton for December delivery rose 1.85 cents, or 2.4
percent, to close at 78.76 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE in
New York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
April 20. Earlier, the price reached 78.94 cents, the highest
level since June 28.  
 U.S. farmers will harvest 18.3 million bales in the 2010-
2011 marketing year that starts Aug. 1, up from a two-decade low
of 12.2 million a year earlier, the USDA said July 9.  Global
production  will jump 13 percent to 116 million bales, according
to the USDA. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  
 Rising Demand  
 In the year ending tomorrow, global  demand  probably will
grow 6 percent to 116.55 million bales, according to the USDA.  
 “We need our warehouses to move cotton quickly enough to
meet strong demand,” said Joe  Nicosia , the chief executive
officer of Allenberg Cotton Co., the largest U.S. merchant.  
 U.S. export sales of upland cotton for the week ending July
22 were 2.3 million bales, up 65 percent from a year earlier,
for the marketing year ending tomorrow.  
 “The pace of U.S. exports over the last 10 weeks has been
exceptionally good, but at today’s values, that level may slow
down,” Nicosia said.  
 In another ICE market, orange-juice futures for September
delivery gained 0.4 cent, or 0.3 percent, to close at $1.466 a
pound, gaining for a third straight week.
