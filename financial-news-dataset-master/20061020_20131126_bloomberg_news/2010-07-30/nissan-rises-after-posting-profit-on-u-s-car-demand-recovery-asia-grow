             Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-
largest carmaker, rose to the highest level in five weeks in
Tokyo after turning to a first-quarter  profit  on recovering auto
demand in North America and rising sales in Asia.  
 Nissan gained as much as 2.8 percent to 688 yen and traded
at 681 yen as of 9:18 a.m. local time. The Yokohama-based
company posted net income of 106.6 billion yen ($1.2 billion)
for the three months ended June 30, compared with a loss a year
earlier, it said after the close of trading yesterday. The
result beat the 58 billion yen average of three analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  expects Nissan’s
global sales to increase 8 percent this fiscal year, aided by 10
new models, including the Leaf electric car and the March
compact. The carmaker’s deliveries surged 68 percent in China
during the quarter compared with a year earlier, while
government subsidies boosted sales in Japan.  
 Sales in Asia excluding Japan rose 62 percent during the
quarter to 308,000 vehicles, while deliveries in its domestic
market grew 19 percent to 138,000. In North America, sales
gained 23 percent to 278,000 units.  
 Nissan reiterated its  forecast  for net income of 150
billion yen for the year ending March 31, compared with 42
billion yen a year earlier.
