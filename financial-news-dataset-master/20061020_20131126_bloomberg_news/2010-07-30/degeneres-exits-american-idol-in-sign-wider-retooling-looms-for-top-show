             Ellen DeGeneres  will leave
“American Idol,” the Fox talent show that has dominated U.S.
ratings for seven years, after being a judge for one season.  
 “This didn’t feel like the right fit for me,” DeGeneres
said yesterday in a statement e-mailed by the  News Corp. 
broadcast network. “While I love discovering, supporting and
nurturing young talent, it was hard for me to judge people and
sometimes hurt their feelings.”  
 The departure of DeGeneres, along with the sharp-tongued
 Simon Cowell , signals some of the biggest changes ever for the
long-running talent contest. “Idol” is coming in for a
retooling even as it continues to outdraw its nearest
competition, ABC’s “Dancing With The Stars” in total viewers.
Fox hasn’t said whether  Kara DioGuardi , added as a judge two
years ago, or the fourth panelist,  Randy  Jackson, are returning.  
 Singer-actress  Jennifer Lopez  is close to signing an
agreement to become a judge, the Associated Press reported,
citing a person with knowledge of the situation. Fox declined to
comment on the speculation. Those under consideration for
Cowell’s spot include  Steven Tyler  and  Harry Connick  Jr., AP
said.  
 The network has talked to  Nigel Lythgoe  about returning as
executive producer of “Idol,” the New York Times reported on
July 27. Ratings for the show fell about 9 percent last season.  
 “We love Ellen and understand and support her decision to
bow out,”  Peter Rice , entertainment chairman at Fox Networks,
said in the statement.  
 News Corp., the New York-based media company controlled by
 Rupert Murdoch , gained 8 cents to $13.04 at 2:27 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . It had fallen 5.3 percent
this year before today.  
 Viewer Averages  
 “American Idol” was the most-watched prime-time program
in the broadcast TV season that ended in May. The twice-weekly
talent contest averaged 24.9 million viewers on Tuesday nights
and 23.7 million on Wednesday nights. The show was also the most
popular program among the 18-to-49 year-old viewers that
advertisers target.  
 “Dancing With The Stars” averaged 17.6 million over its
two nights each week, according to data from Nielsen Co.  
 Cowell said in January he would leave “Idol” to host a
U.S. version of the music competition “X Factor,” which he
created in the U.K. He will be an executive producer and a
judge.  
 TV networks are previewing shows at the Television Critics
Association in Beverly Hills, California. Fox’s presentation is
Aug. 2.
