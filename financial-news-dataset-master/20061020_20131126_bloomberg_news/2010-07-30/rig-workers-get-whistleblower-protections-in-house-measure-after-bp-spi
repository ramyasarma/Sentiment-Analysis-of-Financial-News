             The House passed legislation that
would protect oil-rig workers who report health or safety
concerns from retaliation by their employers.  
 The measure, a response to  BP Plc ’s Gulf of Mexico oil
spill, passed 315-93. The House today is debating a second bill
that would rewrite deep-water drilling rules and tighten safety
and environmental standards.  
 The Gulf spill began April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig, which BP leased from Transocean Ltd., exploded and
caught fire, killing 11 workers and causing it to sink. The well
gushed from 35,000 barrels to 60,000 barrels of oil a day before
the leak was stopped on July 15.  
 Investigations into the accident found that workers on the
rig had worried about drilling operations in the days leading up
to the blast, said Representative  Ed Markey , a Massachusetts
Democrat and chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee’s
energy and environment panel.  
 “We have heard that the workers aboard the rig had safety
concerns, but in the end they were powerless to stop the
cascading string of bad decisions by BP that led to the
disaster,” Markey said during debate. “We are putting in place
state of the art protections for oil and gas workers who are
retaliated against because they raise safety concerns.”  
 The bill prevents companies from firing employees who
report safety violations and allows employees to appeal
perceived retaliation to the Labor secretary.  
 The bill is H.R. 5851.
