             Bidders for  Abertis Infraestructuras
SA  failed to get enough lenders to commit 6.3 billion euros
($8.2 billion) of loans backing their offer for Spain’s biggest
highway operator by today’s deadline, according to three people
familiar with the financing.  
 CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and Abertis’s two main
shareholders, Criteria CaixaCorp SA and Actividades de
Construccion y Servicios SA, received verbal commitments for
about 4 billion euros, less than the amount needed to support a
bid, said the people, who declined to be identified because the
talks are private. An acquisition of Abertis is now unlikely to
proceed until at least September, a fourth person said.  
 The bidders had asked lenders to support the financing by
July 16, before extending the deadline to today when they
weren’t able to get enough banks to commit.  
 CVC and its partners are seeking 5.3 billion euros of term
loans and a 1 billion-euro revolving credit, one of people said.
Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again once it’s been
repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  
 David Sturken, a London-based spokesman for the consortium
of bidders, declined to comment.  Toni Brunet , a spokesman for
Barcelona-based Abertis, also declined to comment.
