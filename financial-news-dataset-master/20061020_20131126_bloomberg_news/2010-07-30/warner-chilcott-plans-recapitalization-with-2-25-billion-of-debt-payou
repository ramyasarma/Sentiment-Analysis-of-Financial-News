             Warner Chilcott Plc , which scrapped
a proposal to cut costs on its loans in January after lenders
rejected the offer, is planning to issue additional debt that
will also be used for a shareholder payout.  
 The company is seeking $2.25 billion of new senior secured
term loans and unsecured debt that will finance a $2.15 billion,
or $8.50 a share, dividend, according to a statement today.  
 Warner Chilcott said the transaction depends on an
amendment to its existing credit facilities, which would allow
it to borrow more for the payout. The Ardee, Ireland-based
pharmaceutical company said it expects to pay the dividend by
Sept. 30.  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. will arrange the amendment, according to a person
familiar with the talks, who declined to be identified because
the terms are private.  
 Bank of America initiated negotiations Jan. 20 to lower
interest rates on Warner Chilcott’s $2.95 billion of bank debt.
Lenders led by  Stanfield Capital Partners LLC  and Oak Hill
Advisors LP objected to the transaction on concern it would
trigger a return to loose lending standards.  
 In October, Warner Chilcott borrowed $1 billion in a term
loan A with a 3.25 percent margin over the London interbank
offered rate and $1.95 billion in a term loan B with a 3.5
percentage point spread over the lending benchmark to finance
its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co.’s prescription-drug
unit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amendment
would have reduced term loan B’s interest rate.
