             Renewable Energy Corp. ASA said its
subsidiary REC Silicon has experienced a power supply outage
with a 100 percent power loss and consequently all of REC
Silicon’s manufacturing facilities in Moses Lake, Washington,
have been shut down.   
 REC Silicon has been able to restart parts of production,
but it is anticipated to take another two weeks before
production is back at pre-outage levels.
