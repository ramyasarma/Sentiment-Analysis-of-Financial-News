             Acciona SA, Spain’s second-biggest
wind operator, saw profit fall 94 percent in the first half
after last year’s results were buoyed by a one-time gain.  
 Net income in the first six months was 78.2 million euros
($102.2 million) compared with 1.2 billion euros in the year-
earlier period, the company said in a regulatory filing today.  
 The company aims to quadruple pre-tax profit by 2013 and
will invest 6.5 billion euros in wind farms, solar plants and
biomass generators over the period to increase its generating
capacity to 10.2 gigawatts, Chairman  Jose Manuel Entrecanales 
said in March.  
 Acciona’s plans have been complicated after the Spanish
government said it plans to cut the subsidies earned by
renewable power producers. The company’s shares have lost around
15 percent since the start of April.
