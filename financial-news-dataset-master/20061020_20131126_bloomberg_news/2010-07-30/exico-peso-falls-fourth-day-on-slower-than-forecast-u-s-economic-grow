             Mexico’s peso rose for the first
time in four days as business activity in the U.S., the nation’s
largest trading partner, expanded faster than forecast.  
 The peso gained 0.5 percent to 12.6502 per dollar at 10:33
a.m. New York time, from 12.7185 yesterday. The currency has
gained 1.7 percent this month and 3.4 percent in 2010. The peso
strengthened 0.6 percent this week.  
 The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its
business barometer rose to 62.3 this month. The U.S. purchases
about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  
 “The business activity data out of the U.S. came out much
better than expected,” said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader at
Banco Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico City. “The data is projecting
that the economy may have a better recovery in the second half
in the manufacturing sector.”  
 The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in 2024 was little
changed at 6.86 percent, according to Banco Santander SA.
