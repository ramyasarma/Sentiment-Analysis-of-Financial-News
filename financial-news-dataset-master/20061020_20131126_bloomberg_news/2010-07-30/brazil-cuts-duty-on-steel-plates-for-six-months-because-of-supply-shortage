             Brazil has lowered for six months
import duties on some steel plates used to produce capital goods
for the petrochemicals industry because of supply shortages, the
Trade Ministry  said .  
 Brazil reduced to 2 percent from 12 percent the import tax
it charges on two specific steel plates, the ministry said in a
statement on its website. Brazil also set a limit of up to 800
tons and 250 tons for the importation of each plate, the
ministry said.  
 Brazilian manufacturers don’t currently produce the plates,
even though they have the spare capacity to do so, the ministry
said.  
 Latin America’s biggest economy has been facing bottlenecks
after growing 9 percent on an annual basis in the first quarter,
driven by consumer demand and investment. The use of installed
capacity fell to 82.3 percent in May, from a 19-month high of
82.8 percent in April.
