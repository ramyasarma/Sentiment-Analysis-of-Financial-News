             MTR Corp. will discuss the future of
Octopus Holdings Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Prudence Chan at a
special board meeting today after she said Octopus sold
customers’ personal data, Ming Pao Daily reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  
 Eva Cheng, the secretary for transport and housing and a
board member of MTR, will attend the meeting, the Hong Kong-
based Chinese-language newspaper said. Octopus, a provider of
electronic-payment services, is 57.4 percent owned by MTR, which
operates Hong Kong’s underground trains and develops property.  
 Octopus made HK$44 million in revenue selling its clients’
personal data since January 2006, Chan said July 26.
