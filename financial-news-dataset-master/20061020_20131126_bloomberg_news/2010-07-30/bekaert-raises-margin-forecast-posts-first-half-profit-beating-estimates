             Bekaert NV , the world’s largest
maker of steel cord used in tires, reported profit that beat
analysts’ estimates and raised its three-year profitability
forecast on the growth of its operations in China.  
 Net income  for the six months through June rose to 181
million euros ($236.6 million), or 9.08 euros a share, from 44.2
million euros, or 2.24 euros, a year earlier, the Zwevegem,
Belgium-based company said in a statement today. Profit beat the
116.3 million-euro average of six  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales climbed 28 percent to 1.53 billion euros.  
 Bekaert said operating profit as a proportion of revenue
will be  at least 10 percent  for the next three years, raising
its guidance from a range of 7 percent to 9 percent. The steel-
cord maker generates more than 80 percent of profit in  Asia ,
where operating margin surpassed 36 percent for a second
straight period, after raising its steel-cord capacity in China
to more than half of its global production capacity.  
 “The risk is to the upside,”  Filip De Pauw , an analyst at
ING Groep NV who recommends buying Bekaert, wrote in a preview
note this week. “ Management  had warned earlier this year that
the 2009 Chinese margins were unsustainable over time, which has
led to some cautiousness in consensus estimates.”  
 Bekaert also said it plans to pay an interim  dividend  of 2
euros a share in October and proposed a three-for-one stock
split on Nov. 10 to improve liquidity in the shares.  
 The steel-cord maker has advanced 39 percent so far this
year in Brussels trading, making Bekaert the best-performing
stock in Belgium’s  Bel20 Index  in the period.
