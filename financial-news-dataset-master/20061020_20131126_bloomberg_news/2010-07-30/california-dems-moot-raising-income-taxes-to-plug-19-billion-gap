             California ’s Democratic leaders plan
to unveil a budget proposal to erase a $19.1 billion deficit as
early as next week that may include a 1 percentage-point rise in
the personal income-tax rate.  
 The increase would affect all taxpayers except those in the
highest tax bracket, according to Senate President  Darrell Steinberg , a Democrat. To make it more palatable to voters,
California’s highest-in-the-nation sales tax would be cut
simultaneously by 2.5 percentage points. Unlike sales levies,
state income taxes are deductible from federal returns. The swap
would add as much as $3 billion to the general fund.  
 “The idea is to increase some taxes that are already
federally deductible and to allow taxpayers to take advantage of
that while lowering some taxes that are not federally
deductible, while the state general fund can gain $2 billion to
$3 billion for education and other vital services,” Steinberg
said in an interview yesterday.  
 California’s legislative leaders have been meeting for the
past three weeks to discuss ways to close the deficit for the
fiscal year that began July 1. Controller  John Chiang  said he
may issue IOUs to creditors in August if a budget isn’t passed
soon. Steinberg said the proposals will be vetted during a joint
budget committee of state Senate and Assembly members next week.  
 Republican Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger , who this week
ordered more than 150,000 public workers to take three days of
unpaid time off to conserve cash, probably wouldn’t support an
income tax increase, said his spokesman  Aaron McLear .  
 ‘Volatile Income Tax’  
 “Relying even more on the volatile income tax is not the
way to go,” McLear said in an interview yesterday. “Our tax
system is mostly based on capital-gains taxes on rich folks, so
when those rich folks have a good year we have more revenue
coming in. But when California taxpayers have a bad year we end
up having less revenue coming in.”  
 Schwarzenegger in May proposed $12.4 billion in cuts,
including the elimination of some health-care and welfare
payments to the poor. Steinberg said the Democrats may support
half of those cuts, if the balance could be satisfied by tax
increases.  
 California’s top individual income tax rate is 9.55
percent, although there is an additional 1 percent tax for
mental-health services on incomes in excess of $1 million. The
state has the  highest  sales tax in the U.S. at 8.25 percent,
according to the Washington-based Tax Foundation, a non-partisan
research group.  
 Republican lawmakers, who first brought the idea of the tax
swap to the negotiating table, said they can’t support the plan
as the Democrats are suggesting.  
 “It was intriguing but when we looked at it we realized
there was no way to accomplish it without a massive tax increase
on the middle class,” said Senate Republican Leader  Dennis Hollingsworth  in an interview yesterday.
