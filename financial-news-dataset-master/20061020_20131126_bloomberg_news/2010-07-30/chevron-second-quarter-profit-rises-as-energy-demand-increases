             Chevron Corp. , the second-biggest
U.S. oil company, said profit tripled, exceeding analysts’
estimates, after recovering demand for petroleum-based fuels
lifted energy prices.  
 Second-quarter net income jumped to $5.41 billion, or $2.70
a share, from $1.75 billion, or 87 cents, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based  Chevron  said today in a statement. Per-
share profit was 24 cents higher than the average of 18
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Chevron follows  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and ConocoPhillips in
reporting surges in earnings this week after recovering
economies around the world boosted demand for diesel and other
fuels. Refining earnings at Chevron jumped more than sevenfold
to $975 million. U.S. oil futures averaged $78.05 a barrel in
the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.  
 “It’s a common theme this quarter of riding higher
commodity prices and improved refining and chemical margins,”
said  Brian Youngberg , an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis
who has a “buy” rating on Chevron shares and doesn’t own any.
“I think the company continues to have a good outlook going
forward.”  
 Revenue climbed 32 percent to $53 billion, Chevron said.
Oil and natural-gas  production  rose 2.8 percent to the
equivalent of 2.75 million barrels of crude a day.  
 Worldwide demand for oil in the second quarter increased an
estimated 3.2 percent from a year earlier, according to the
International Energy Agency in Paris.  
 Shares Rise  
 Chevron  rose 19 cents to $76.21 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has
18 buy and 8 hold  ratings  from analysts, has climbed 13 percent
in the past year.  
 Chevron Chief Executive Officer  John Watson  aims to boost
oil and gas production with wells in places such as the Gulf of
Mexico and Australia. The industry is coping with a moratorium
on new deep-water drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf following an
explosion April 20 at BP Plc’s Macondo well, which killed 11
workers and caused the biggest oil spill in U.S. history.  
 Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil company, said yesterday
that its second-quarter net income jumped 91 percent to $7.56
billion.  ConocoPhillips , the No. 3 U.S. energy producer, said
July 28 that its profit jumped almost fivefold to $4.16 billion.
