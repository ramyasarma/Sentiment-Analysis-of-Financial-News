             U.S. stocks and commodities erased
losses, while Treasuries pared their advance, as higher-than-
estimated readings on consumer confidence and American business
activity tempered concern the economic rebound is slowing.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,102.51 at 10:43 a.m. in New York after tumbling as much as
1.2 percent earlier. The 10-year Treasury yield lost 4 basis
points to 2.94 percent after dropping 7 basis points earlier.
The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of commodities erased a 0.7
percent slide and climbed to an almost three-month high.  
 Equities recovered from an early selloff after the
Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its business
barometer expanded in July at a faster pace than projected and
the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer
sentiment declined less than forecast.
