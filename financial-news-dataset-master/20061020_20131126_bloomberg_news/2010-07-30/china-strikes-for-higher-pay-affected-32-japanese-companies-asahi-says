             Strikes in China that lasted nearly
two months starting in May affected 43 foreign companies,
including 32 Japanese businesses, the Asahi newspaper
said, citing its own research.  
 Calls for higher wages escalated after Honda Motor Co.
agreed to raise salaries 24 percent at a plant in Guangdong,
southern China, in early June, the report said. Workers shared
the news of wage increases using mobile phones and online
forums, spreading the strikes to plants of Toyota Motor Corp.
and other manufacturers, it said.
