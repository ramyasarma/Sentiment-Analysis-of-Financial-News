             Britain’s criminal courts have the
right to try four U.K. politicians for false accounting, an
appeal court ruled today.  
 The Court of Appeal in London rejected arguments made by
the men’s lawyers that the rule of “Parliamentary privilege”
means that they can only be tried by Parliament, not a normal
criminal court. The ruling upholds an earlier judgment.  
 Elliot Morley ,  David Chaytor  and  Jim Devine , all former
Labour Party members of the House of Commons, and Paul White, a
Conservative member of the House of Lords, have all pleaded not
guilty to making fraudulent expenses claims to the House of
Commons and House of Lords while working as lawmakers.  
 The lawmakers are alleged to have taken advantage of their
financial allowances “to commit crimes of dishonesty to which
parliamentary immunity does not, has never, and, we believe,
never would attach,” the three-judge panel said in its ruling.  
 The U.K.’s Supreme Court has the power to overturn the
judgment.
