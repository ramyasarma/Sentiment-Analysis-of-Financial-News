             Scottish Resources Group Plc, the
largest surface-mine coal producer in the U.K., postponed its
initial public offering after facing a “challenging market.”  
 Selling shareholders of the Gartlove, Scotland-based
company will restart the offering after the summer, Scottish
Resources said in a statement today. The company, which was
scheduled to sell shares in mid-to-late July, had planned to
list on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Panmure
Gordon & Co. was leading the sale.  
 Scottish Resources  Chief Executive Officer Don Nicolson
said last month that its two main stockholders were seeking to
sell the majority of their stakes.  
 Parkburn Ltd. owns 71 percent and Palmaris Capital Plc has
16 percent of the coal producer, he said.
