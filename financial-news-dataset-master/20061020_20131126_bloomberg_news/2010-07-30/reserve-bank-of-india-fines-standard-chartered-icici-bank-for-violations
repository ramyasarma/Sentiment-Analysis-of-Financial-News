             The  Reserve Bank of India  fined
ICICI Bank Ltd. and the local unit of  Standard Chartered Bank
Plc  for violating banking rules, the central bank said in a
statement today.  
 Both banks were fined 500,000 rupees each ($10,770), the
central bank said.  
 The British bank did not provide information on time about
a foreign currency loan it arranged for an overseas company,
while India’s second-largest lender was penalized for violating
customer information norms, the central bank said.  
 “Standard Chartered followed the highest standards of
compliance in all its markets and will continue to do so,” said
Beverly Mathews, a spokeswoman for the bank in Mumbai. She
confirmed Standard Chartered had received the central bank’s
notification.  
 ICICI Bank  spokesman  Charudatta Deshpande  said the
violation related to a single account opened by a customer.  
 “RBI concluded that the substitution of introduction by an
existing customer for address proof was not in accordance with
guidelines,” he said in an e-mail.
