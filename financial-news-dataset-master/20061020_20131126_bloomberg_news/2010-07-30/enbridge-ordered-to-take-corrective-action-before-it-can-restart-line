             Enbridge Energy Partners LP  won’t be
able to start its 268-mile pipeline that spilled oil in Michigan
until it takes “corrective action,” the Department of
Transportation said.  
 The 30-inch Line 6B was shut after it leaked an estimated
19,500 barrels of oil July 26. The pipeline can transport
190,000 barrels a day of light synthetic and heavy and medium
crude oil between Sarnia, Ontario, and Griffith, Indiana.  
 “Prior to resuming operation of the section of Line 6B
pipeline segment,” according to the order issued July 28.
Enbridge must “submit a written restart plan for prior
approval.”  
 Larry Springer , a spokesman for Enbridge, didn’t
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.  
 The pipeline supplies crude oil to refineries in Toledo,
Ohio, Detroit and Sarnia, Springer said earlier this week.
Plants in those areas include two in Toledo operated by BP Plc
and Sunoco Inc., one in Detroit owned by Marathon Oil Corp. and
Sarnia plants run by Imperial Oil Ltd., Suncor Energy Inc., and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  
 The line had annual maintenance this year and none of the
area involving the breach was replaced, Chief Executive Officer
 Patrick Daniel  said on a conference call yesterday. It could be
weeks before the cause of the leak is known, he said.
