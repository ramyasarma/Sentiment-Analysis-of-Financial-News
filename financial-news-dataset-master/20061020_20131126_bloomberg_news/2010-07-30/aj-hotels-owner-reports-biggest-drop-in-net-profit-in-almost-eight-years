             Indian Hotels Ltd. , the nation’s
largest operator, reported it biggest drop in profit in almost
eight years as costs rose and it kept part of the terrorist-hit
Taj Mahal Hotel & Towers closed for renovation.  
 Net income  at the company chaired by  Ratan Tata  plunged 80
percent to 33.3 million rupees ($716,000) in the three months
ended June 30 from 164.4 million rupees in the year earlier
period, the company said in a statement to the Bombay Stock
Exchange today. That’s the biggest drop in profit since the
quarter ended Sept. 30, 2002, according to data on the Bloomberg.  
 Indian Hotels  fell  1.9 percent to 99 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, its biggest drop in almost two months. The
heritage wing of the hotel built in 1903 was gutted when
militants armed with guns and explosives killed 166 in attacks
across Mumbai in 2008. Sales at the company, which plans to open
the renovated heritage wing on Aug. 15, rose 25 percent in the
quarter.  
 “This seems to be the lowest point,” as sales have
started to increase, said  Himani Singh , an analyst with Elara
Securities Ltd. in Mumbai who rates the stock a “ buy .” Still
profitability will only improve if the company “can ensure they
launch their coming properties on time and without delay.”  
 Indian Hotels has spent 1.8 billion rupees renovating its
flagship hotel, Managing Director  Raymond Bickson  told reporters
in Mumbai today.  
 The company’s insurance for business interruption expired
in November, Indian Hotels said in the statement. Costs
increased 9 percent.  
 Terrorists entered luxury hotels including the Taj and
Oberoi, a railway station, Jewish center and tourist cafe on Nov.
26, 2008, spraying bullets and throwing grenades. Twenty-five
days later, part of the Taj Mahal and the Trident Hotel,
adjacent to the Oberoi, reopened.
