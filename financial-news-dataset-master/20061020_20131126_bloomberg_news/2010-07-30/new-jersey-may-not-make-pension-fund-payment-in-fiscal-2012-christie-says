             Governor  Chris Christie  of  New
Jersey  said the state may not be able to make a required pension
payment in the next fiscal year.  
 Christie’s comment contrasts with those of his treasurer,
 Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff , who told Bloomberg News July 28 that
the state planned to make a $512 million contribution to the
pension system in fiscal 2012, its first in four years.  
 “I think the treasurer got a little bit out in front on
that,” Christie, 47, told reporters today during a news
conference in Trenton. “We’ll go forward and we’ll make that
contribution if the state is in a position to make that
contribution.”  
 The governor, who took office in January, skipped a $3
billion payment into the $66.9 billion  fund  in his first budget
as he coped with a record $10.7 billion deficit. The fund, which
provides benefits for almost 800,000 current and retired
teachers and government workers, had a gap between assets and
anticipated payouts of $46 billion as of June 30, 2009.  
 The payment “is something that is required under current
law,” he said. “Laws change all the time. That’s our current
intention, but that could change.”  
 The ability to make a pension payment depends upon the
state’s financial condition, Christie said. The nonpartisan
 Office of Legislative Services  projected the state may face a
deficit of $10.5 billion next year even as revenue grows $1
billion if Christie fully funds all programs and makes a
recommended pension payment of $3.5 billion.  
 Pension Costs  
 The governor said he intends to work with lawmakers later
this year on a series of changes to lower future pension costs.
Those initiatives may include scaling back a 9 percent pension
increase enacted in 2001 and reducing future benefits for
current workers, he said.  
 In March, the first-term Republican signed a package of
bills barring part-time workers from the pension system, capping
payouts for unused sick-time and requiring employees to pay 1.5
percent of their salaries for health insurance.  
 “Six years from now, public workers are going to thank me
because there will be a pension there to collect,” Christie
said. Public workers and government officials can’t “continue
to bury our heads in the sand and believe that somehow the
forces of the market or good luck are going to get us out of
this.”  
 Christie, the first Republican elected governor of New
Jersey since 1997, closed the gap in his $29.4 billion spending
plan for the year that started July 1 by skipping a $3 billion
pension payment and cutting aid to public schools by $820
million and municipalities by $445 million. He also suspended
almost $1 billion in property-tax rebates in a state where
residents pay the highest real-estate levies in the U.S.

                          July 28 (Bloomberg) -- New Jersey Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff talks about the state's budget situation and shortfall projections for fiscal 2012.
     Sidamon-Eristoff, speaking with Margaret Brennan on Bloomberg Television's "InBusiness," said projections that the state faces a gap of more than $10 billion for the year that begins July 1, 2011, are "wildly inflated." (Source: Bloomberg)
