             BP Plc ’s next attempt to more fully
seal its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico may be delayed by a
day so the company can remove debris from a relief well.  
 The “static kill” procedure, in which mud and cement will
be pumped into the well, may start Aug. 3, National Incident
Commander  Thad Allen  told reporters today on a call.  
 Tropical Storm Bonnie, which entered the Gulf on July 23,
caused some of the sediment along the sidewalls of the relief
wellbore to fall inside, Allen said. BP, based in London, is
removing the debris today before running a well casing.  
 During the storm, BP was forced to evacuate drilling
vessels from the spill site, 40 miles (64 kilometers) off the
Louisiana coast.  
 “This is something that often happens when you have been
off of a hole for a period of time,”  Kent Wells , BP senior vice
president for exploration and production, said today during a
conference call with reporters. “We don’t expect to have a lot
of problems,” Wells said of the wellbore-cleaning process.  
 Macondo was shut with a stack of valves on July 15 after
spewing oil into the Gulf for almost three months.  
 BP expects to start pumping mud into the top of the broken
well Aug. 3, although that could happen late Aug. 2, Wells said.
The company will start running casing in the relief well
tomorrow and start cementing it on Sunday, Wells said.  
 Permanent Plug Delayed  
 BP plans to permanently plug the well by the end of August,
said  Bob Dudley , who takes over as BP’s chief executive officer
on Oct. 1. Dudley spoke today during a press conference in
Biloxi, Mississippi.  
 BP initially planned to have the well permanently sealed by
the middle of next month. The two-week delay is due to time lost
during the tropical storm,  Daren Beaudo , a company spokesman,
said in a telephone interview today. Beaudo said cleaning the
debris has set back the timing by an additional half a day.  
 If the static kill shows that the Macondo well is damaged,
it can still be shut using a relief well to pump mud and cement
through the bottom, Wells said.
