             A union for  Visteon Corp.  retirees
is seeking greater influence over the auto-parts maker’s
bankruptcy exit plan, saying it has a claim for $100 million
that entitles it to more votes on the proposal.  
 The Communications Workers of America said Visteon’s
valuing the union claim at $1 would “effectively
disenfranchise” the retirees in creditor voting that ends
today, as votes are apportioned by the size of the claim. The
union, in papers filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington, Delaware, asked the judge to recognize its position
on the claim in the balloting.  
 Creditors of Visteon, based in Van Buren Township,
Michigan, must decide by today whether to support the company’s
reorganization plan. The distressed-debt investment company,
Fulcrum Credit Partners LLC, has urged creditors including
Visteon’s unions and suppliers to reject the plan and force the
company give them a bigger repayment.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge  Christopher S. Sontchi  in
Wilmington, Delaware, will take the tally into consideration
when he decides whether to approve Visteon’s reorganization.  
 On July 15, an appeals court ordered benefits for 2,100
former workers in Indiana restored after a lower court judge
ruled in December that the company had the right to cancel them
without first negotiating with the union, according to court
records.  
 The case is In re Visteon Corp., 09-11786, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
