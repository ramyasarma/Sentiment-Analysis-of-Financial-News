             An Argentine economy ministry
official said the country is not in a rush to sell bonds even as
yields fall to about 10 percent.  
 Argentina may sell bonds overseas when yields reflect what
the country should pay, the official said on the condition he
not be identified in accordance with ministry policy.  
 Economy Minister Amado Boudou has said that the country
won’t sell bonds until yields fall to a “single digit.”
