             Germany midfielder  Sami Khedira  will
join Real Madrid from Stuttgart, the Bundesliga club said on its
website.  
 Khedira’s transfer will become official after he passes a
medical examination, Stuttgart said, without disclosing
financial terms of the move.  
 “A true leader and a player who identifies with the club
such as Sami Khedira is one that you naturally don’t want to let
go,”  Fredi Bobic , Stuttgart’s sporting director, said on the
 website . “On the other hand, we can perfectly understand Sami’s
wish to further his career at Real.”  
 Khedira, 23, has made 12 appearances for the German
national team since debuting last September. He replaced the
injured  Michael Ballack  at the World Cup in South Africa and
scored his first international goal as Germany beat Uruguay in
the third-place match.
