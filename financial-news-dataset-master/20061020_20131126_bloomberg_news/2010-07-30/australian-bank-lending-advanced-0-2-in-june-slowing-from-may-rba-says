             Australian bank lending rose in
June, according to a central bank statement.  
 Loans provided by banks and other finance companies gained
0.2 percent from May, when they increased 0.5 percent, the
Reserve Bank of Australia said in Sydney today. The median
estimate of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a
0.4 percent gain. Lending increased 2.8 percent from a year
earlier.  
 Loans to consumers to buy houses gained 0.4 percent from
May and rose 8.2 percent from a year earlier, according to
today’s statement. Credit provided to consumers for purchases
other than housing fell 0.3 percent from a month earlier for an
annual gain of 3.1 percent.  
 Lending to companies was unchanged from May, for an annual
decline of 5 percent.
