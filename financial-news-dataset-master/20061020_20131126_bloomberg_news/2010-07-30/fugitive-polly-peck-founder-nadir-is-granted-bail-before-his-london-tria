             Asil Nadir , the founder of  Polly
Peck International Plc  who fled to northern Cyprus in 1993, can
return to the U.K. on bail before standing trial in London
for embezzling 30 million pounds ($47 million).  
 Nadir’s bid for bail was granted and he must attend court
in London on Sept. 3, Judge  David Bean  said at a hearing today
at the Old Bailey criminal court. Within eight hours of
returning to the U.K. he must be fitted with an electronic
security tag, Bean said.  
 Nadir’s lawyer, William Clegg, told Bean his client had
agreed with the U.K. Serious Fraud Office, which is prosecuting
the case, to return to London, surrender his passport, visit the
police every week and attend his criminal trial.  
 “Mr. Nadir is today anxious to return to this country and
face his trial,” Clegg said before the ruling. Nadir has
already taken an option to rent an apartment in London, his
lawyer said.  
 Nadir fled the U.K. after he was charged with theft and
false accounting. Polly Peck was a food-packaging firm that
collapsed in 1990 after it failed to pay creditors.
Administrators found more than 700 million pounds were
unrecoverable from the subsidiaries.  
 Victor Temple, a lawyer for the SFO, said during the
hearing that the agency would not oppose bail if Nadir appeared
in court to request it.
