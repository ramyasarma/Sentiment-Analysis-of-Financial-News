             The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in  South Africa .
Stock symbols are in parentheses after company names and prices
are from the last close.  
 South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  snapped two
days of losses, rising 182.81, or 0.6 percent, to 28,550.07 by
the close in Johannesburg.  
 Absa Group Ltd.  (ASA SJ): South Africa’s third-largest bank
by assets said first-half earnings per share excluding one-time
items fell as much as 5 percent. Absa gained 1.07 rand, or 0.8
percent, to 138.85 rand.  
 Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ): The global mining and natural
resources company said first-half profit doubled and it resumed
dividend payments. Anglo climbed 4.03 rand, or 1.4 percent, to
295.80 rand.  
 AngloGold Ltd. (ANG SJ): The third-largest producer of the
metal was rated new “hold” by Citigroup Global Markets.
AngloGold is Citi’s preferred pick in the South African gold
sector, it said. Shares in Africa’s largest producer of the
precious metal fell 62 cents, or 0.2 percent, to 291 rand.  
 Gold Fields Ltd.  (GFI SJ): Africa’s second-largest gold
producer was rated new “sell” by Citigroup Global Markets. The
company’s 26 billion rand ($3.5 billion), three-year capital
expenditure budget is “unlikely to result in any significant
net growth,” Citi said. Shares in Gold Fields added 50 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to 96.80 rand.  
 Harmony Gold Mining Co.  (HAR SJ): Africa’s third-largest
producer of the metal was rated a new “sell” by Citigroup
Global Markets. Harmony’s high-cost assets and concentration of
mines in South Africa position the company poorly for longer
term value creation, Citi said. Shares in Harmony gained 48
cents, or 0.7 percent, to 72.38 rand.  
 Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.  (KIO SJ): The unit of Anglo American
Plc continues talks with the National Union of Mineworkers over
a pay dispute. The Pretoria-based company’s shares gained 2.65
rand, or 0.7 percent, to 367 rand.

percent, to 61 rand.
