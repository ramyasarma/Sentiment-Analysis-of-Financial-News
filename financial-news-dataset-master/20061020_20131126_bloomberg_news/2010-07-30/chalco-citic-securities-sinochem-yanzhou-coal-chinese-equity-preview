             China’s stocks  dropped, paring the
benchmark index’s biggest monthly advance in a year, on concern
recent gains were excessive relative to earnings prospects.  
 Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. , the listed unit of China’s fourth-
biggest coal miner, slumped 3 percent after cutting its earnings
growth forecast.  Northeast Securities Co.  slid 1.2 percent after
net income fell.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest producer of the metal, rose the most in more than four
months after agreeing to buy a stake in Rio Tinto Group’s
Simandou iron ore project in Guinea.  
 “This month’s rebound by stocks is running ahead of
economic fundamentals and it’s still unknown if the government
will relax tightening policies,” said  Wei Wei , an analyst at
West China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Disappointing earnings
figures from some companies may lead to weak expectations about
the second half of the year.”  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, lost 10.61, or 0.4 percent, to 2,637.50
at the 3 p.m. close. The  CSI 300 Index  fell 0.3 percent to
2,868.85.  
 The Shanghai index rallied 10 percent in July, the most
since July last year when it gained 15 percent, on expectations
the government will ease property curbs and allow more lending
to offset a slowdown in economic growth. The measure is still
down 20 percent in 2010 on concern measures to control real-
estate speculation and accelerating inflation will damp earnings.  
 Shanghai will announce tightening measures for the real
estate market in the second half of the year, the Oriental
Morning Post reported, citing Zhou Bo, head of Shanghai’s
National Development and Reform Commission.  
 Corporate Earnings  
 Yanzhou Coal  dropped 3 percent to 17.84 yuan, the most
since July 1, after cutting its estimate for the likely increase
in first-half profit to 35 percent, compared with an earlier
estimated gain of more than 100 percent. The company said that
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Australian and U.S.
dollars resulted in a loss on a loan.  
 Xishan Coal & Electricity Power Co.  slid 3.4 percent to
21.45 yuan. The company’s earnings per share of 0.54 yuan in the
first half is 17 percent less than the 0.65 yuan average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Northeast Securities retreated 1.2 percent to 24.11 yuan
after net income for the first half fell 77 percent from a year
earlier.  
 Beijing Bank Co. Chairman  Yan Bingzhu  said China may raise
interest rates in the third quarter, the China Securities
Journal reported today. The nation doesn’t have much room to
increase reserve ratio requirements, the newspaper cited Yan as
saying.  
 Interest Rates  
 China has left interest rates unchanged since December 2008,
even as countries from Malaysia to Taiwan, South Korea and India
lifted them. Trade reports from the region have indicated little
sign so far that Europe’s budget cuts and U.S. joblessness are
damaging exports.  
 People’s Bank of China officials said “that with a benign
inflation outlook there was less need for higher nominal
interest rates at this point,” the International Monetary Fund
said in a statement yesterday after annual consultations with
the Chinese government. “Also, they were concerned that higher
interest rates could risk fueling capital inflows.”  
 Chalco Acquisition  
 Chalco, as the Beijing-based company is known, gained 6.7
percent to 10.89 yuan, the biggest increase since March 19. The
stock was suspended for the past two days.  
 Separately, insurers may be allowed to invest 25 percent of
their assets in A-shares, A-share funds, bond funds and money
market funds, rising from the current 20 percent, the Shanghai
Securities News reported today, without citing anyone.  
 The following companies were among the most active in
China’s markets. Stock symbols are in brackets after companies’
names.  
 China CAMC Engineering Co.  (002051 CH) added 3.9 percent to
38.60 yuan after the China Securities Regulatory Commission
approved the company’s private placement plan. The stock was
suspended from July 27 to yesterday.  
 Sichuan Chuantou Energy Co.  (600674 CH) lost 1.9 percent to
13.44 yuan after saying first-half profit fell 27 percent from a
year earlier.  
 Sinochem International Corp.  (600500 CH) added 1.9 percent
to 10.17 yuan after posting a 77 percent increase in first-half
profit.  
      Tianjin Benefo Tejing Electric Co.  (600468 CH) advanced 1.5
percent to 20.09 yuan, its highest since it began trading in
June 2001. The company plans to make equipment for China’s smart
power grids as it raises funds through a private placement of 65
million shares to as many as 10 investors, Tianjin Benefo said.  
 Xinghui Auto Model Co.  (300043 CH) rose 2.6 percent to
42.45 yuan after the Chinese company reached an agreement with
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG to produce models of BMW 6 series
cars.
