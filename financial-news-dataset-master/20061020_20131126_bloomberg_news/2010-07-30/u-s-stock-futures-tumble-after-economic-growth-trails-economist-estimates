             U.S. stock-index futures tumbled
after the government said the economy grew at a 2.4 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, trailing economists’ 
estimates and adding to concern the recovery is slowing.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September lost 0.8 percent to 1,087.4 at 8:31 a.m. in New York.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank 79 points, or 0.8
percent, to 10,330.  
 The S&P 500 has climbed 6.9 percent in July, the biggest
monthly advance in a year, as second-quarter earnings topped
estimates at about 77 percent of its companies that have
reported so far, according to Bloomberg data.   
 The gauge has fallen 0.1 percent so far this week after
consumer confidence slumped more than forecast, orders for
durable goods unexpectedly decreased and the Federal Reserve
said economic growth has slowed in some areas.   
 Today’s report on gross domestic product showed the economy
has grown for a fourth straight quarter after shrinking for five
of the previous six. The S&P 500 slid to a 12-year low of 676.53
on March 9, 2009, as the U.S. economy was on its way to a 6.4
percent contraction for the first quarter of that year, its
worst since 1982. The index has rebounded 63 percent since then.
