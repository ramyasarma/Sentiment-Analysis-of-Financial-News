             India’s benchmark stock index fell,
completing its first weekly slide in four weeks, led by  Hero
Honda Motors Ltd.  after its quarter earnings fell short of
analysts’ estimates.  
 Hero Honda, the nation’s biggest motorcycle maker, lost 3.2
percent after posting its first drop in quarterly profit in
almost three years as higher raw material costs eroded gains
from selling more two-wheelers.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. , the
largest energy explorer, fell after first-quarter net income
declined 25 percent.  
 “Investors don’t have any patience for underperformance,”
said  Jagannadham Thunuguntla , chief strategist at SMC Capitals
Ltd. in New Delhi. “Companies whose results have been weak are
getting punished.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 123.71, or 0.7 percent, to 17,868.29. The gauge lost 1.5
percent this week, its first drop in four weeks, trimming its
monthly advance to 1 percent. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the
National Stock Exchange lost 0.8 percent to 5,367.60. The  BSE
200 Index  retreated 0.5 percent to 2,281.63.  
 Hero Honda dropped 3.2 percent to 1,814.85 rupees.  Net
income  in the three months through June fell 1.7 percent to 4.92
billion rupees ($106 million). That was lower than the 5.8
billion-rupee  average profit estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of
26 analysts.  
 Increasing Expenses  
 Hero Honda’s spending on raw materials such as steel and
rubber rose to 72 percent of its sales in the quarter, from 68
percent a year ago, Chief Financial Officer  Ravi Sud  said.  
 Oil & Natural Gas lost 0.5 percent to 1,240.7 rupees. Its
first-quarter net income decreased 25 percent to 36.6 billion
rupees from a year earlier. That compares with the 38.5 billion-
rupee mean estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Indian equity funds posted an eighth consecutive week of
inflows and China stock funds recorded the biggest weekly intake
since mid-April, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global,
which tracks $13 trillion of assets, said in an e-mail today.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  6.53 billion rupees  ($140.3
million) of Indian equities on July 28, raising total
investments in the stocks this year to 432.6 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Bank of Baroda  (BOB IN) advanced 2.5 percent to 752.35

 GAIL India Ltd.  (GAIL IN) decreased 3.2 percent to 438.5

to “hold” from “buy” by  Girish Nair , an analyst at BNP

delay in gas supplies.  
 Hindustan Construction Ltd.  (HCC IN) soared 4 percent to
