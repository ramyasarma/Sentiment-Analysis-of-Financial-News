             The rate that European banks say
they see each other paying for three-month loans in euros fell
for the first time in more than three months.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such
loans, fell to 0.896 percent from 0.899 percent yesterday,
according to the European Banking Federation. The rate last fell
on April 20.  
 The Euribor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to
lend, was little changed at 0.349 percent.
