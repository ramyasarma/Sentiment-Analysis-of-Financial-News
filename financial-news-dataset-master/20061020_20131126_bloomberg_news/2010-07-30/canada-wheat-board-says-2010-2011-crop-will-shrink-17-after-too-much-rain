             Western Canada will produce 15.6
million metric tons of wheat in the 2010-2011 crop year that
starts tomorrow, down 17 percent from an estimated 18.8 million
tons a year earlier as unusually wet weather prevented seeding
in some areas and limited plant growth, the Canadian Wheat Board
said today in a report.
