             An international sports court
rejected the appeal of Italian cyclist Davide Rebellin, who gave
up his silver medal for road cycling at the 2008 Olympics
because he failed a doping test.  
 Rebellin’s test didn’t find human growth hormone, but
follow up detected EPO, a drug used to boost red cell counts.
The International Olympic Committee disqualifed the rider, who
then appealed saying errors were made in the testing. The Court
of Arbitration for Sport rejected his appeal, the Laussane,
Switzerland-based group said today in an e-mailed statement.
