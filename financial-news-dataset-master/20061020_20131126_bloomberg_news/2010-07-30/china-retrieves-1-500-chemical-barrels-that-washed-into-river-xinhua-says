             Chinese soldiers and emergency
workers had retrieved almost 1,500 of the 7,000 chemical barrels
that were washed into a river in the nation’s northeast by flood
waters as of 7:30 p.m. local time yesterday, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported.  
 About 3,000 of the 7,000 barrels were filled with
chemicals, Xinhua reported, without saying how many of the
retrieved barrels contained chemicals. Tests yesterday morning
showed the river water wasn’t contaminated, Xinhua reported.  
 Some of the barrels, which authorities tracked with
helicopters, have disappeared, Xinhua reported. Retrieval of
barrels that may have sunken to the riverbed will be a “more
arduous task,” Xinhua reported, citing unidentified experts.
