             Singapore employers expanded
payrolls for a fourth consecutive quarter as record economic
growth prompted companies in the services and construction
industries to boost hiring.  
 The city state added an estimated 26,500 jobs in the three
months ended June, after the creation of 36,500 positions in the
first quarter of 2010, the  Ministry of Manpower  said in a
statement today. The seasonally adjusted  unemployment rate  rose
to 2.3 percent from the previous quarter’s 2.2 percent as more
jobseekers entered the labor market.  
 Singapore’s  economy  is in contention to be the world’s
fastest-expanding in 2010 as rising demand for goods and
services prompted the government to raise growth forecasts three
times this year. The expansion is expected to stoke wage
increases that Credit Suisse Group AG said may reduce margins at
labor-intensive companies such as Singapore Technologies
Engineering Ltd. and SMRT Corp.  
 “Employment continued to grow in the second quarter of
2010 as the economy expanded strongly,” the Ministry of
Manpower said today. “Unemployment has broadly stabilized,
after declining sharply at the end of last year.”  
 The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of nine
economists was for a jobless rate of 2.1 percent.  
 The services industry added 27,400 jobs last quarter while
 construction  companies increased hiring by 1,800, the report
showed, citing preliminary data. The manufacturing industry cut
2,400 jobs.  
 Singapore’s economy will overheat if the country doesn’t
let in more foreign workers to counter a “tight” labor market,
Prime Minister  Lee Hsien Loong  was cited as saying by the
Business Times on July 15.  
 The government expects the Southeast Asian island’s economy
to expand 13 percent to 15 percent in 2010. Growth accelerated
to 18.1 percent in the first half, the fastest pace since
records began in 1975.
