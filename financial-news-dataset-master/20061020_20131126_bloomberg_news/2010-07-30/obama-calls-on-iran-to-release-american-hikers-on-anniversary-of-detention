             President  Barack Obama  today called
for the immediate release of three U.S. hikers who have been
held in Iran for almost a year.  
 Obama said in a statement released today that the three,
Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal, and Sarah Shourd, have never worked
for the U.S. government and committed no crime before they were
detained July 31, 2001.  
 “For a full year, they have been held in prison, causing
extraordinary grief and uncertainty for them, for their
families, and for their loved ones,” he said.  
 Obama said their detention has nothing to do with the
differences between the U.S. and Iranian governments. The U.S.
has been pushing for tougher sanctions against Iran in response
to its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons.  
 “All Americans stand together in support of our citizens
who are suffering through unjust detention abroad, and we will
not rest until they are home,” he said.
