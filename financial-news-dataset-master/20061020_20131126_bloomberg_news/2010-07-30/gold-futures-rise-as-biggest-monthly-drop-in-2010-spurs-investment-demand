             Gold rose for a third day on
speculation that the biggest monthly drop since December will
encourage investors to stock up on the precious metal as a
haven.  
 The 5 percent price drop in July is the first monthly
decline since March, and gold has fallen 6.5 percent from its
June 21 record of $1,266.50 an ounce. Holdings in the SPDR Gold
Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, have
declined 1.5 percent this week, heading for the biggest weekly
drop since April 2009.  
 “Gold is beginning to catch some traction,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. “The correction may have run its course and for
longer-term holders, this may be a buying opportunity.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery rose $12.70, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $1,183.90 as of 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in
New York, the biggest gain since July 13. The most-active
contract ended the week down 0.3 percent.  
 The euro headed for the first monthly gain against the
dollar since November. Gold also reached records last month in
euros, British pounds and Swiss francs as investors sought a
haven during Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “We view the latest decline in the gold price as
temporary,” analysts at Deutsche Bank AG said today in a
report. “This weakness has been driven more by liquidation in
net length among the investor community than a structural change
in fundamentals.”  
 Concern for Deflation  
 Gold may be one of the best assets to own in a deflationary
environment, said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector
Asset Management in Evanston, Illinois.  
 Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard 
said yesterday that the U.S. economy may be headed into a
deflationary period similar to the one that gripped Japan.  
 “It’s looking like deflation is more of a risk now than
inflation,” Kaplan said. “In a deflationary period, gold will
go down the least.”  
 The Fed has kept the  benchmark interest rate  between zero
and 0.25 percent since December 2008 to spur growth, which
fueled speculation that the economy will face rampant inflation
as it emerges from the recession.  
 “Gold won’t fall out of bed under any scenario in the
future,” Klopfenstein of Lind-Waldock said. “There are a lot
of macro headwinds. Low rates will spark inflation down the
line, once we get past deflation.”  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 38.6 cents, or
2.2 percent, to settle at $18.003 an ounce on the Comex. The
metal is down 0.5 percent this week and 3.8 percent in July.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery gained $13.40, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,576.80 an ounce on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The price gained 2.2 percent this week and
2.6 percent in July.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $8.80, or
1.8 percent, to settle at $500 an ounce on the Nymex. The metal
gained 7.1 percent this week and 13 percent this month.
