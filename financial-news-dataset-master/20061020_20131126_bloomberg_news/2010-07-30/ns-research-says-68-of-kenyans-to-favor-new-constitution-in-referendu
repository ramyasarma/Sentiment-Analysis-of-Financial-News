             Kenyans will vote in favor of a new
constitution in an Aug. 4 referendum by a 68-to-25 margin,
according to a public opinion survey released today by  TNS
Research International .  
 Ninety-five percent of registered voters said they will
vote in the forthcoming referendum, Geoffrey Kimani, research
director at TNS Research International, told reporters today in
Nairobi, the capital. The poll found that 3 percent won’t vote.  
 The company interviewed 1,600 respondents selected randomly
from the east African nation’s eight provinces. Seven percent
said they were undecided. The margin of error in the survey
conducted from July 23 to July 25 is 2.45 percent, Kimani said.  
 The draft constitution aims to limit presidential powers,
make land distribution more equitable and ease ethnic divisions
that sparked post-election violence in 2008, killing as many as
1,500 people.  
 Synovate Ltd., Kenya’s biggest pollster, said on July 23
that 58 percent of Kenyans backed the proposed changes, while 22
percent would reject it, according to a survey it conducted
among 6,005 people from July 11 to July 17.
