             Remains of a body found in the
Republic of Ireland may be those of one of 14 people whom the
Irish Republican Army killed and secretly buried, the group set
up to search for their corpses said.  
 “The Independent Commission of the Location of Victims’
Remains in its search for the body of Charlie Armstrong have
found human remains in Monaghan,” the group said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. “The recovery is ongoing and the
formal identification process will take some time.” Irish
police were notified of the find, the group said.  
 Charlie Armstrong was 55 years old when he  disappeared  in
1981 shortly after leaving his home in Crossmaglen, south
Armagh, near the border with Ireland and the victim’s family
blamed the IRA for his disappearance. The  ICLVR  last year
anonymously received information and a map detailing the
location of his body.  
 The IRA is blamed for killing and secretly burying 14
people during its 36-year-long fight to unify Ireland with the
counties of Northern Ireland. So far, six of the victims bodies
have been found. The IRA in 2005 formally ended its campaign and
pledged to pursue its goals peacefully.
