             Asil Nadir, the founder of Polly
Peck International Plc who fled to Northern Cyprus in 1993, can
return to the U.K. on bail to stand trial in London, a U.K.
judge ruled today.  
 Nadir’s bid for bail was granted and he must attend court
in London on Sept. 3, judge David Bean said. Within 8 hours of
returning to the U.K. he must be fitted with an electronic
security tag, Bean said.
