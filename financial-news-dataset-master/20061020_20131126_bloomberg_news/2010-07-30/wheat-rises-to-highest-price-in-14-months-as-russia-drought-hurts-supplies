             Wheat rose to the highest price in
almost 14 months, capping the biggest monthly gain since 1973,
as drought in exporting countries including Russia threatened to
reduce supplies.  
 Global inventories will fall to 192 million metric tons by
June 30, 2011, down 2.5 percent from a year earlier, the London-
based International Grains Council said yesterday. Russia’s
harvest will drop 19 percent to 50 million tons this year, the
IGC said. Drought has damaged 32 percent of Russia’s planted
area, the government said.  
 “With the news that’s coming out of Russia, stocks are
tightening up all around,” said  Jason Britt , the president of
Central States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri. “Any
decreases in the crop will come to center stage.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 34 cents, or 5.4
percent, to close at $6.615 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $6.63, the highest level for a
most-active contract since June 3, 2009. Prices gained 11
percent this week and 38 percent this month as prospects dimmed
for crops. The monthly increase is the biggest since August
1973.  
 Canada, the largest exporter after the U.S., will produce
15.6 million tons of spring wheat, down 17 percent, and 2.9
million tons of durum varieties, down from 5.5 million tons a
year earlier, the Canadian Wheat Board said in a  report  today.
Excessive rainfall during the past three months curbed seeding
and damaged plants, the board said.  
 “Canada had record rainfall in the spring that prevented
acres from being planted,” said  Louise Gartner , the owner of
Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek, Ohio. “The rains persisted
and kept on and on. The wet areas weren’t able to recover
quickly enough to get off to a decent start.”  
 Speculator Holdings  
 Speculative investors as of July 20 held  net-long positions
in wheat  for the first time since June 2009, according to the
most recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission report. The
CFTC will update its position report today and may show an even
bigger net-long position, Britt said.  
 “When you’ve got momentum like this and you’re above the
moving averages, until something trips this up, you suspect the
specs are going to build into bigger long positions,” Britt
said.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
