             Gold, little changed in New York
today, may gain on speculation that the metal’s biggest monthly
decline this year will increase demand.  
 Bullion is set for a third weekly drop and the first
monthly slide since March. Prices have slumped 5.8 percent in
July, the most since December’s 7.3 percent retreat, and this
week fell to a 12-week low as holdings in gold-backed exchange-
traded funds slid.  
 “Despite the scale of selling seen in gold from funds and
ETF redemptions, the metal has found good volumes of over-the-
counter physical and investment buying,” said  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London.  
 Gold futures for December delivery added $2.90, or 0.3
percent, to $1,174.10 an ounce at 8:03 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices are down 1.2 percent this week. The metal for
immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent higher at
$1,171.85.  
 Bullion rose to $1,168 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,162.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Nine of 22 traders,
investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, or 41 percent,
said bullion will rise next week. Eight forecast lower prices
and five were neutral.  
 Futures have slumped 7.3 percent since reaching a record
$1,266.50 an ounce on June 21 on an easing of European financial
turmoil and on signs the global economy is rebounding. Figures
yesterday showed European confidence in the economic outlook
rose in July to the highest level in more than two years.

 “The gold price has recently been under pressure from
greater economic confidence and firmer commodity prices, which
have taken some of the uncertainty out of financial markets,”
said  Gavin Wendt , senior resource analyst at MineLife Pty Ltd.
“In turn, there has been some selling of gold.”  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at 1,282.28 metric tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. Holdings dropped
18.55 tons on the previous day, the most in more than two years.  
 The International Monetary Fund’s gold reserves fell by
17.4 tons to 2,933.92 tons in June, according to figures from
the Washington-based lender. Russia increased holdings by 6.56
tons to 709.8 tons, the data show.  
 Silver for September delivery in New York increased 0.3
percent to $17.67 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery was
little changed at $1,563 an ounce. Palladium for September
delivery gained as much as 0.3 percent to $492.85 an ounce, the
highest price in five weeks, and was last down 0.3 percent at
$489.85.
