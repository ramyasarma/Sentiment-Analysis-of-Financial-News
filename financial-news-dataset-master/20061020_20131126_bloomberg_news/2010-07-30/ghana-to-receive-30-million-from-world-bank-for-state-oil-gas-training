             Ghana, which is set to begin
production of oil for export by the end of the year, will
receive $30 million from the World Bank to train state
institutions overseeing the fledgling industry, the lender said.  
 The money will be given to the government in about two
months, said Kofi Tsikata, spokesman for the bank’s Ghana
office.  
 The Washington-based lender is also in talks with the
administration to lend money to state oil company Ghana National
Petroleum Corp. to develop a natural gas project at the offshore
Jubilee oil field, Tsikata said in a phone interview from the
capital, Accra, today. He declined to provide details.
