             Grupo Mexicana de Aviacion, Mexico’s
biggest airline by passengers, said its financial situation is
“critical” and shareholders asked the board of directors to
present proposals to keep the company operating.  
 Executives and shareholders of Mexicana, which Mexico City-
based Grupo Posadas SAB bought from the government in 2005, met
today to review the “difficult” situation the carrier faces
because of its financial woes, company spokesman Adolfo Crespo
said.   
 “The board of directors will present proposals to ensure
the viability of the company,” Crespo said. A date for the
presentation of the proposals hasn’t been set, he said.
