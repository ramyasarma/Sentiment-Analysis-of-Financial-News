             U.K. government bonds rose, wiping
out a monthly decline, as consumer confidence fell more than
economists forecast this month, fueling speculation that the
recovery will stall as the government cuts spending.  
 The gains pushed the 10-year yield to the lowest in a week.
An  index of sentiment  declined to minus 22 this month from minus
19 in June, the lowest in 11 months, market researcher GfK NOP
said in an e-mailed statement today. Reports yesterday showed
 house prices  fell this month while banks approved fewer
mortgages than economists forecast in June. The gilt yield has
declined from 3.53 percent on July 27, the most since June 21.  
 “With fiscal consolidation, the government’s contribution
to growth will not last,” said  Matteo Regesta , a fixed-income
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London. “I remain constructive
on gilts in terms of outright direction.”  
 The 10-year yield decreased six basis points to 3.34
percent as of 1:21 p.m. in London. The 4.75 percent security
maturing March 2020 gained 0.48, or 4.8 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,559) face amount, to 111.47. The two-year yield fell five
basis points to 0.77 percent.  
 The pound was little changed at $1.5603 and was 0.3 percent
stronger at 83.49 pence per euro. The currency has lost 1.7
percent this year, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes.  
 Gilts returned 5 percent this year, compared with a gain of
6 percent for German bonds, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Treasuries handed investors 6.3 percent.  
 Budget Deficit  
 Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s plans to slash the U.K.
budget deficit are stoking speculation that the recovery from
the worst recession on record will flounder. The U.K. economy
will probably expand by 1.2 percent this year, trailing behind
3.1 percent in the U.S. and 2 percent in Germany, according to
Bloomberg surveys of economists.  
 U.K. bonds outperformed their German peers in July, with
the spread between 10-year gilts and similar maturity bunds
narrowing to 65 basis points today, from 78 basis points on June
30. The spread narrowed from 103 basis points on May 7, the most
since October 2005  
 Ten-year gilts may yield as little as 40 basis points
relative to bunds in the next three months, according to  Marius Daheim , a senior fixed-income strategist at Bayerische
Landesbank in Munich.  
 “The growth and inflation outlook argues for further gilts
outperformance,” Daheim said. “The growth differential is
something that will support” gilts further, he said.  
 The 10-year breakeven rate, which measures the yield
difference between regular and index-linked bonds and
anticipates consumer-price growth in the U.K. during the next
decade, fell one basis point to 266 basis points today, down
from a 2010 high of 325 basis points in April.
