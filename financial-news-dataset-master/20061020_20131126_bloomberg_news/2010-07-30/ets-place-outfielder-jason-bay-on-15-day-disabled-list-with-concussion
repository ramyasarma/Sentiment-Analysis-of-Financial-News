             New York Mets outfielder Jason Bay
was placed on the disabled list three days after being diagnosed
with a mild concussion.  
 Bay was injured on July 23 when he crashed into an outfield
wall while making a catch against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He
experienced headaches and was diagnosed with a concussion on
July 27. His time on Major League Baseball’s disabled list is
retroactive to July 26.  
 Bay, the Mets’ major off-season free-agent acquisition with
a $66 million, four-year contract, is batting .259 with six home
runs and 47 runs batted in. The Mets said in a news release that
they called up outfielder Jesus Feliciano to take Bay’s roster
spot.
