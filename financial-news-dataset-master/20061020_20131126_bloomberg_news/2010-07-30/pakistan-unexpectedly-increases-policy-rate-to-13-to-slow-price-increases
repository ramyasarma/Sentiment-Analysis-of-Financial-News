             Pakistan’s central bank unexpectedly
increased its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four
meetings as power and food costs add to inflationary pressures.  
 The State Bank of Pakistan increased its discount rate to
13 percent from 12.5 percent,  Yaseen Anwar , acting Governor of
the State Bank of Pakistan said at a news conference in Karachi.
All 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey were for the rate to
be kept unchanged.  
 Pakistan, which has one of the world’s highest benchmark
rates, joins Asian economies from India to Malaysia in raising
borrowing costs as the region leads the global economic
recovery. The move comes even as Pakistan Prime Minister  Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani ’s government stresses the need for low
borrowing costs to support economic growth.  
 “Government borrowings and expected pressure from tariff
and commodity price may have convinced central bank to tighten
the policy,”  Asad Farid , economist at AKD Securities Ltd. in
Karachi, said before the announcement.  
 Inflation in June stood at 12.69 percent in Pakistan.
Average inflation in the year starting July 1, may be as high as
12 percent, Anwar said.  
 “There are risks to the inflation outlook,” he said
today. “Persistent energy shortages and poor law and order are
adding to the problems.”  
 Borrowing Costs  
 The World Bank said last month South Asian economies
including Pakistan need to raise borrowing costs to contain
inflation.  
 Pakistan raised power rates by 7.6 percent on July 1, an
increase that took effect retrospectively in April, to meet a
condition set by the International Monetary Fund for an $11.3
billion bailout.  
 Food prices may also increase in August as demand rises
during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan starting next month.  
 “Power tariff rise and food prices may increase the pace
of price gains,” AKD’s Farid said.  
 Higher borrowing costs may hurt companies including  Engro
Corp.  and  D.G. Khan Cement Co.  which has taken loans to expand
their businesses.  
 The government expects the South Asian economy to grow 4.5
percent in the year that started July 1, the fastest pace in
three years.  
 Fiscal Deficit  
 The nation’s fiscal deficit target of 4 percent of gross
domestic product “seems challenging,” Anwar said. It may reach
5 percent in the year that started July 1, he said.  
 The gap in the year ended June 30, may widen to 6.4 percent
of GDP, compared with a revised target of 5.1 percent, he said.  
 In the last three reviews the central bank kept the
benchmark interest rate unchanged after cutting it three times
in 2009 by a cumulative 2.5 percentage points.
