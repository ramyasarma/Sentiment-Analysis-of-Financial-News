             United Bank Ltd. , Pakistan’s third-
largest by assets, said second-quarter profit rose 30 percent as
provisions for bad debts declined.  
 Net income rose to 2.38 billion rupees ($27.8 million), or
1.97 rupees a share, from 1.83 billion rupees, or 1.50 rupees, a
year earlier, the Karachi-based bank said in a statement to the
 stock exchange  today. Revenue rose to 8.9 billion rupees from
7.62 billion rupees.  
 “Despite the decline in interest income, the drop in
provisioning helped the bank post a profit in the quarter,”
said  Hifza Zia , research analyst at Elixir Securities Ltd., in
Karachi.  
 Pakistan’s central bank in October 2007 began requiring
lenders to set aside more funds to cover delinquent loans, then
eased the rules last year. Banks are currently allowed to use 40
percent of the value of assets provided as collateral to meet
requirements for provisions against defaults.  
 Shares of United Bank, which have  gained  11 percent this
year,  fell  0.9 percent to 58.95 rupees as of 3:13 p.m. local
time on the  Karachi Stock Exchange . The bank plans to pay an
interim cash dividend of 10 percent, according to the statement.  
 Provisions for loan defaults and bad debts fell to 1.99
billion rupees at the end of the second quarter, from 4.47
billion rupees a year earlier, according to the statement.  
 The U.K.’s Bestway Holdings, United Arab Emirates-based Abu
Dhabi Group and Pakistan’s government are the lender’s largest
stakeholders.  
 Net income in the first six months rose to 5.13 billion
rupees, or 4.22 rupees, from 4.59 billion rupees, or 3.75
rupees, a year earlier, the bank said. First-half revenue rose
to 17.6 billion rupees from 15.9 billion rupees. The provisions
for loan defaults and bad debts fell to 4.12 billion rupees.
