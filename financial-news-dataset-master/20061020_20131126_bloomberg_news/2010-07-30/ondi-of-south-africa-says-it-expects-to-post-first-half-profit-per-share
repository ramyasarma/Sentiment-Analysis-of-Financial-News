             Mondi Ltd. , Europe’s largest maker
of office paper, said it expects to report “considerably higher”
operating profit for the year’s first six months.  
 Basic underlying earnings will be in the range of 17 euro
cents to 22 cents per share, compared with 8.3 cents a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said today in a
statement. That excludes “special items,” Mondi said.  
 The first half’s results will include a non-operating, one-
time gain of 5 million euros ($6.5 million), while the year-
earlier period included 78 million euros of charges related to
asset impairments, reorganization and costs associated with mill
closures, Mondi said.  
 The company plans to report earnings on Aug. 10, it said.
