             Kumho Asiana Group, the South
Korean group that lost control of units to creditors, said
Chairman  Park Chan Bup  was stepping down on health grounds
after a year in the job.  
 Park, 65, will become an adviser to unit  Asiana Airlines
Inc.  after leaving his post tomorrow, Kumho Asiana said in an
e-mailed statement. No replacement has been selected yet, it
said.  
 Park in December agreed to sell control of  Daewoo
Engineering & Construction Co.  to Korea Development Bank as
Kumho Asiana sought funds to pay debts stemming from the
unprofitable purchase of the construction company in 2006.
KDB and other creditors also took control of  Kumho Industrial
Co.  and  Kumho Tire Co.  earlier this year as Kumho Asiana
struggled for funds.  
 The group said on Jan. 5 that it plans to raise 1.3
trillion won ($1.1 billion) from asset sales to repay debts.
Korea Development Bank agreed to acquire 50 percent plus one
share in Daewoo Engineering for 2.9 trillion won.  
 Kumho Industrial , a builder, gained as much as 5.4
percent in Seoul trading to 3,495 won and stood at 3,330 won
as of 11:47 a.m.  Kumho Tire  advanced as much as 5.4 percent
to 4,850 won.  Asiana Airlines , the nation’s second-biggest
carrier, dropped as much as 2.4 percent to 8,710 won.
