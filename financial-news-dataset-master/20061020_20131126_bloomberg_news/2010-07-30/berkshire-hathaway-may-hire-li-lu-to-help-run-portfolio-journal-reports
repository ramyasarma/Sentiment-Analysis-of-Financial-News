             Li Lu, a hedge fund manager, is in
line to help manage Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s portfolio, the
Wall Street Journal said, citing Charlie Munger.  
 “In my mind, it’s a foregone conclusion” that Li, 44,
will become one of the top Berkshire investment officials,
Munger, Berkshire’s 86-year-old vice chairman, told the Journal.  
 Li introduced Buffett to BYD Co., a Chinese battery and
auto maker; Buffett’s stake has surged six-fold since then, the
Journal said.  
 Buffett declined to comment on his succession plans, the
Journal reported, adding that he doesn’t rule out bringing in
investment managers.
