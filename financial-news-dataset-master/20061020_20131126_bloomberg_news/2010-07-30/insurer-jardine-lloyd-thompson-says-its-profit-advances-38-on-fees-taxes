             Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Plc ,
the U.K.’s biggest publicly traded insurance broker, said first-
half profit climbed 38 percent on higher commissions and a lower
tax charge.  
 Net income rose to 58.6 million pounds ($91.5 million) in
the six months to June 30, from 42.5 million pounds a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
That beat the 45.4 million-pound median estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “Organic growth at the retail business is particularly
strong at 9 percent and this division tends to be higher
margin,” said  Thomas Dorner , a London-based analyst at Oriel
Securities Ltd. with an “add” rating on the stock. “It’s a
relatively smaller and more specialist player that continues to
take market share from the larger brokers.”  
 JLT, which earns money by taking a proportion of customers’
insurance premiums, has been making small acquisitions overseas
to boost sales as insurance rates decline. The company bought a
stake in Greco Group, Austria’s largest insurance broker,
earlier this week and has made 26 acquisitions in the last four
years.  
 The broker will continue to buy firms at a similar rate in
the next 12 months and is considering adding to all divisions,
Chief Executive Officer  Dominic Burke  said in a telephone
interview said.  
 Revenue climbed 21 percent to 375.5 million pounds and the
group’s tax charge almost halved to 9.4 million pounds. The
broker raised its first-half dividend to 8.8 pence a share from
8.5 pence a year earlier.  
 The stock declined 0.5 pence, or 0.1 percent, to 585 pence
at 8:55 a.m. in London, valuing the firm at 1.3 billion pounds.
