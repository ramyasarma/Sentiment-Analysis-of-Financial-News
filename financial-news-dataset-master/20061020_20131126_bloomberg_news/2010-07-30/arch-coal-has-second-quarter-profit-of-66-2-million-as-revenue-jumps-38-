             Arch Coal Inc. , the second-biggest
U.S. coal producer, raised the lower end of its earnings
forecast after reporting second-quarter profit of $66.2 million
amid higher sales of the fuel.  
 Net income was 41 cents a share compared with a net loss of
$15.1 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier, St. Louis-based Arch
said today in a statement. The company was expected to  earn  26
cents, the median of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue swelled 38 percent to $764.3 million.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Steven Leer , 58,  raised  Arch’s
sales forecast to 147 million to 155 million tons from a January
estimate of 145 million tons to 155 million on increased demand
for coal to make steel.  
 “Volumes are certainly better and frankly pricing is
considerably better,” said  James Rollyson , an analyst at
Raymond James Financial Inc. in Houston. “The metallurgical
coal price is economy-related. Last year they had an ugly
quarter.”  
 Arch rose $1.17, or 5.2 percent to $23.67 at 10:56 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 6.3 percent this year.  
 “Quarterly revenues increased nearly 40 percent versus the
second quarter of 2009, driven by stronger global and domestic
coal market fundamentals and higher volumes than in the year-ago
quarter,” Arch said in the statement.  
 Earnings Forecast  
 The company expects earnings per share for the year to
between 98 cents and $1.26, up from an earlier forecast for as
low as 87 cents per share. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization will be between $718 million and
$790 million, up from as low as $700 million.  
 Second-quarter results included an after-tax gain of $26.4
million for the exchange of reserves with Knight Hawk Holdings
LLC that increased its stake in the Illinois Basin-producer to
42 percent from 33 percent, Arch said.  
 The company on July 12 said it would idle its Dugout Canyon
mine in Carbon County, Utah, at least through August because of
elevated carbon monoxide levels. Arch shut the mine, which
accounts for about 2 percent of its total output, in April,
restarted it May 21 and then closed it again on June 22.  
 “Dugout Canyon was a little bit of an issue this quarter,
but most of that will be felt in the third-quarter,” Rollyson
said.  
 Metallurgical Coal  
 Arch said in April it expects to sell 6 million to 7
million tons of steelmaking coal to take advantage of the rising
prices. U.S.  steel output  was up 66 percent from a year earlier,
according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.  
 JFE Holdings Inc., Japan’s second-largest steelmaker and
BHP Billiton Inc. negotiated a $200 a ton contract for the three
months started April 1, up 55 percent from last year. The
contract is considered the industry benchmark for metallurgical
coal.  
 In U.S. spot markets, coal from Wyoming’s Powder River
Basin, which holds the nation’s largest and least expensive
reserves, averaged $11.57 per ton during the second quarter, up
39 percent from the $8.32 a ton a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 (Arch will hold a conference call with analysts and
investors at 11 a.m. New York time. To access a Webcast of the
