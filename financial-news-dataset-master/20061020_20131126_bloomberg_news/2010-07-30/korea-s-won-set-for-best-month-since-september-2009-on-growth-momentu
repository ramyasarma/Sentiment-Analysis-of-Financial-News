             South Korea’s won was headed for its
biggest monthly increase since September 2009 as economic growth
gains momentum, spurring demand for the nation’s assets.  
 Industrial production  rose 16.9 percent in June from a year
earlier, the statistics office said today, compared with the
median estimate for an advance of 16.5 percent in a Bloomberg
News survey. The Bank of Korea this week reported a current-
account  surplus  of $5.04 billion for June, the most in a year.  
 “I’m reasonably happy with the data as growth is holding
up pretty well,” said  Brian  Jackson, a Hong Kong-based senior
emerging-markets strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. “Trade
data has been solid, suggesting a fair bit of support from
external demand, which is reflected in the industrial output.”  
 The won appreciated 2.9 percent this month to trade at
1,187.30 per dollar as of 9:27 a.m. in Seoul, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency climbed 1 percent this week
and lost 0.1 percent from yesterday.  
 The won reached a five-week high of 1,181.33 on July 27
before retreating the next day as traders said the Bank of Korea
bought dollars to counter appreciation.  
 “The BOK will try to moderate any gains,” Jackson said.
“We are pretty positive on the won, and we are looking for
gains in the second half to 1,125 by the end of September.”  
 The economy  grew  1.5 percent in the second quarter from the
previous three months, faster than the 1.3 percent growth
forecast in a Bloomberg survey, data this week showed.
