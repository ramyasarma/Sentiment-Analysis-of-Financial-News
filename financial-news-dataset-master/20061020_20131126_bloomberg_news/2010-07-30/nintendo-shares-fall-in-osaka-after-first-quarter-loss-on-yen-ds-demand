             Nintendo Co.  fell the most in two
weeks in Osaka trading after the world’s largest maker of video-
game consoles posted a loss last quarter, citing a foreign
currency-related charge and lower demand for DS players.  
 Nintendo dropped as much as 2.6 percent, its biggest
intraday loss since July 16, and was 2.3 percent lower at 24,060
yen as of 10:14 a.m. local time. The  stock  has retreated 23
percent this fiscal year, compared with a 14 percent decline by
the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  
 The  net loss , Nintendo’s first in more than two years, was
25.2 billion yen ($291 million) in the three months ended June,
compared with a 42.3 billion yen profit a year earlier, the
Kyoto-based company said yesterday after markets closed. The
game maker said it booked a foreign currency-related one-time
loss of 70.5 billion yen.  
 Nintendo , which saw DS sales plunge 33 percent in the U.S.
last month, said a lack of new game titles hurt  revenue  as it
kept its  outlook  for annual profit to drop to the lowest in four
years. President  Satoru Iwata  plans to introduce a 3-D model of
the DS and a heart-rate-tracking “Vitality Sensor” accessory
for the Wii console this fiscal year to revive  earnings growth .  
 The company yesterday said the euro weakened to 107.81 yen
in the quarter, from 124.92 yen as of March 31, while the dollar
fell to 88.48 yen from 93.04 yen. A stronger Japanese currency
reduces the value of Nintendo’s overseas sales and assets.
Nintendo maintained its full-year exchange-rate estimate at 120
yen for the euro and 95 yen for the dollar.  
 First-quarter sales of DS hardware dropped 47 percent to
3.15 million players, while those of software dropped 23 percent
to 22.4 million units, the company said.  Nintendo  released 168
titles for the handheld player in the period, compared with 278
games a year earlier.
