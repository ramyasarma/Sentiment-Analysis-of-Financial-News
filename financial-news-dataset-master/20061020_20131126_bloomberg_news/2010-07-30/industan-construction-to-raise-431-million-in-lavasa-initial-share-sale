             Lavasa Corp., a unit of Indian
developer  Hindustan Construction Ltd. , plans to raise as much
as 20 billion rupees ($431 million) by selling shares.  
 Lavasa, which has built a namesake township near Mumbai,
will sell a 10 percent stake in an initial public offer and
will file sale documents with the regulator “very soon,”  Ajit Gulabchand , chairman of Hindustan Construction, said today.  
 “The present economic environment is appropriate to
unlock value in Lavasa,” Gulabchand told reporters in Mumbai.
“Demand for equity assets is strong, since a lot of potential
in India is yet to be realized.”  
 Lavasa proposes to sell shares following real estate
companies such as Embassy Property Developers Ltd., which plans
to raise 24 billion rupees in an IPO, according to a share sale
document filed this month. Lodha Developers Ltd., Sahara Prime
City Ltd. are also planning to raise money, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Hindustan Construction  shares  rose 4 percent to 133.85
rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The stock has declined
8.4 percent this year.  
 Only one of the three developers that sold shares this
year is trading above its initial share sale offer price as
investors shun property stocks. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s
 Realty Index  has dropped 12 percent compared with a 2.3 percent
increase in the benchmark Sensex Index.  
 Profit at Lavasa rose 87 percent to 490 million rupees in
the quarter ended June 30. Sales climbed 94 percent to 1.81
billion rupees, Hindustan Construction said in a statement to
the Bombay stock exchange today.  
 The township of Lavasa, spread over 25,000 acres (10,117
hectares), claims to be India’s first planned hill city set
amidst seven hills and 60 kilometers (37.3 miles) of lakefront.  
 The company has started work on its second township, the
statement said.
