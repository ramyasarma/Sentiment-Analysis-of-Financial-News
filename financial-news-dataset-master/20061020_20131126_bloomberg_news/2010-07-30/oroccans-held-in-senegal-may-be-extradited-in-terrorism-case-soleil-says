             Three Moroccan men arrested in
Senegal over allegations they planned a training mission to an
al-Qaeda base in Somalia will be sent to their home country if
Senegalese President  Abdoulaye Wade  signs their extradition
documents,  le Soleil  said, citing unidentified legal officials.  
 Senegal’s court of appeals ruled yesterday that Sy Mouhamet
Nadane, Moulaye El Hatlani and Mouhamet Nadane should be
returned to Morocco, the Dakar-based newspaper said. Their
defense team argued that the men will be tortured by Moroccan
intelligence agents if returned, le Soleil reported.  
 Moroccan intelligence agents asked Senegal’s police to
arrest the men as they passed through the West African country
in June, the newspaper cited unidentified investigators as
saying. Moroccan officials allege the men were planning to
attack military and police bases in Morocco, le Soleil said.
