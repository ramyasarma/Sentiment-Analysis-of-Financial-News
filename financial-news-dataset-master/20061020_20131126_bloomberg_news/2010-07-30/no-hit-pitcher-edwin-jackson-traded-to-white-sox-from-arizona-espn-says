             Edwin Jackson , who pitched one of
Major League Baseball’s five no-hitters this season for the
Arizona Diamondbacks, was traded to the Chicago White Sox,
ESPN.com reported.  
 The Diamondbacks get pitchers  Daniel Hudson  and David
Homberg in change, the website reported without saying where it
got its information.  
 Jackson, 26, no-hit the Tampa Bay Rays on June 25, walking
eight batters and throwing 149 pitchers. In his first season in
the National League, he was 6-10 with a 5.16 earned run average
with the last-place Diamondbacks. For his career, Jackson has a
4.74 ERA with four teams.  
 Jackson was part of the three-team offseason deal in which
outfielder  Curtis Granderson  joined the New York Yankees from
the Detroit Tigers.
