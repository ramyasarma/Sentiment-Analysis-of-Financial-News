             Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar , Brazil’s biggest retailer, was cut to
“neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which
said second-quarter earnings fell short of expectations.  
 The stock also suffers from an “overhang” stemming from
the postponement of financial statements related to its takeover
of rival Casa Bahia Comercial Ltda., analysts led by  Andrea Teixeira  wrote in a note to clients today.
