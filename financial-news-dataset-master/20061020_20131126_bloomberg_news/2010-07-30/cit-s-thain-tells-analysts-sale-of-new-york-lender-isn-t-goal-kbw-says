             John A. Thain , the former Merrill
Lynch & Co. executive leading a turnaround of  CIT Group Inc. ,
told analysts he didn’t take the job to wind down the company,
according to KBW Inc.  
 “It appears unlikely that a sale of the company will occur
in the near term,” said a report today by analyst  Sameer Gokhale  of New York-based KBW Inc., describing a meeting that
Thain, CIT’s chief executive officer, hosted for analysts
yesterday. “ John Thain ’s mandate when he joined the company was
not to pursue a sale of the company and he would not have joined
were it simply in runoff.”  
 Thain’s comments may quell speculation that the New York-
based lender, which survived a bankruptcy last year, will be
forced to find a buyer because it needs lower-cost financing.
CIT told investors July 27 it’s selling  assets  to pay down debt
left over after its reorganization concluded in December.  
 To preserve tax benefits tied to prior losses, CIT will
have to decide by September whether to keep open the option of
selling itself within the following two years, the analysts were
told, according to Gokhale. CIT spokesman  Curt Ritter  declined
to comment.  
 CIT dropped 14 cents to $36.36 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock has gained 32
percent this year.  
 The commercial lender collapsed last year because of bad
loans and dependence on the credit market for financing its
assets. Thain was hired in February to run the company.

 Company executives predicted CIT assets will continue “to
shrink for another quarter or two” and then resume growth “in
the not-too-distant future,” Gokhale wrote.  
 It could take CIT “at least 12 months” to bring its risk
management and information systems up to a level that regulators
will decide is good enough for them to remove curbs on banking
activities, Thain said in a conference call with investors July
27. The time required “could be disappointing to some investors
who were hoping for more immediate positive catalysts,” Gokhale
wrote in today’s report.  
 More than a dozen analysts attended the meeting, including
some who don’t write about the company, Gokhale said in a
telephone interview. “The company is clearly interested in
getting more analyst coverage,” he said.
