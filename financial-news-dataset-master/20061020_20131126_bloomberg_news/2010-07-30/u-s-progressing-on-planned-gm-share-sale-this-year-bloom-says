             The U.S. government is making
progress on its plans to sell shares in General Motors Co.
before year’s end, an aide to President Barack Obama said.  
 “We’re hopeful that General Motors can go public later
this year,”  Ron Bloom , senior counselor for manufacturing
policy, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today. “We
think things are going well.”  
 Obama , trying to highlight success in the government
bailouts of Detroit-based GM and Chrysler LLC, travels to the
Detroit area today to visit a Chrysler plant and a GM facility
that are adding production. Obama plans a stop next week at a
Chicago factory run by Ford Motor Co., an automaker that didn’t
seek U.S. aid.  
 Polls that show the public is skeptical about the $84.8
billion rescue of GM and Chrysler. Republicans have been
critical of the bailout, along with Obama’s broader economic
policies, and the rescue may be among the issues in the November
elections to determine control of Congress.  
 “All three of the companies are making money,” Bloom
said. “We did the right thing.”
