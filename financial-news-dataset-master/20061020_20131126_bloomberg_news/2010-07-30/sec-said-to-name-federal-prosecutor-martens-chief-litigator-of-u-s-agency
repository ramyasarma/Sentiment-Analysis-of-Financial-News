             The Securities and Exchange
Commission named a U.S. prosecutor its top litigator as the
agency prepares for legal fights with billionaire  Raj Rajaratnam 
and Countrywide Financial Corp. co-founder  Angelo Mozilo .  
 Matthew Martens, an assistant U.S. attorney in North
Carolina, agreed to be chief litigation counsel, said two
people familiar with the matter who declined to be indentified
before the SEC’s announcement. Martens will replace  Luis Mejia ,
who stepped down in December to join the law firm DLA Piper.  
 The SEC’s chief litigator oversees lawyers who argue cases
that go to trial. Rajaratnam is fighting allegations that his
hedge fund Galleon Group engaged in insider trading. Among other
pending SEC cases is an insider-trading lawsuit against Mozilo
and claims filed yesterday accusing billionaire brothers  Samuel Wyly  and  Charles Wyly  of securities fraud.  
 Martens was part of a team of government lawyers who
reached a $50 million settlement in 2009 with  Beazer Homes USA
Inc.  over allegations that the Atlanta-based company committed
mortgage fraud.  
 SEC spokesman  John Nester  declined to comment. A phone
message left for Martens at his office wasn’t immediately
returned.
