             Sony Corp.  gained the most in six
months in Tokyo trading after raising its forecast for full-year
profit and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its target for the
share price.  
 The  stock  rose as much as 5.1 percent to 2,745 yen, the
biggest intraday gain since Jan. 28, and traded at 2,712 yen as
of 10:13 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Sony’s biggest rival
Panasonic Corp., which also raised earnings forecasts yesterday,
gained as much as 4.4 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average dropped 1.3 percent.  
 Sony, maker of Bravia televisions, yesterday raised its
full-year net income  forecast  20 percent to 60 billion yen ($693
million), citing strong sales of liquid-crystal display TVs.
Sony unexpectedly reported net income of 25.7 billion yen in the
 first-quarter , from a loss of 37.1 billion yen a year earlier.
The median estimate by six analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
was for an 18 billion yen loss.  
 The results prompted Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital to
raise their share-price estimates for Sony by 6.7 percent and 21
percent respectively.
