             Kenya’s  benchmark stock index  rose
to its highest level in 23 months, and posted its  ninth monthly  
rise in 10 on expectations that voters will approve a new
constitution that may promote stability in East Africa’s biggest
economy.  
 The 55-member Nairobi Stock Exchange All Share Index
climbed 1 percent today to close at 77.4 as of 3 p.m. in the
capital, the highest since Sept. 5, 2008, extending the gain in
July to 4 percent.  
 “The index is reacting to the referendum,” James Mose, a
research analyst at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Financial Services
Ltd., said in an interview. “The new draft is good for business
and I expect the market to rally after the referendum.”  
 Kenyans will vote in favor of a new constitution in an Aug.
4 referendum by a 68-to-25 margin, according to a public opinion
survey released today by TNS Research International, with 95
percent of registered voters saying they will vote, said
Geoffrey Kimani, research director at TNS. The poll found that 3
percent of citizens won’t vote.  
 Gainers include  TPS Eastern Africa Ltd. , the parent of the
Serena hotel chain in the region, which surged 25 percent in the
month.  British American Tobacco Kenya Ltd.  rallied 16 percent
to the highest since Jan. 12, 2007 and  Housing Finance Co. Ltd. ,
the country’s only listed mortgage company, advanced 13 percent
to 23.75 shillings, a more than 22-month high.  
 The draft constitution aims to limit presidential powers,
make land distribution more equitable and ease ethnic divisions
that sparked post-election violence in 2008, killing an
estimated 1,500 people.  
 Resources  
 The draft constitution is good for business because
all appointees of the president will be vetted by parliament,
Mose said.  
 TPS received regulatory approval on July 22 to sell more
shares. The proceeds will be used to fund expansion.  
 British American Tobacco Plc’s Kenyan unit said on July 23
that half-year profit climbed 19 percent to 1.02 billion
shillings ($12.7 million) as sales rose.  
 Housing Finance said on July 21 first-half net income
surged 54 percent and that it expects to increase lending to
meet growing demand.  
 Kenya’s central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark
interest rate by 0.75 of a percentage point to 6 percent on July
28, the sixth reduction since 2009, to help spur economic growth
and boost the expansion. The rate is now at its lowest level
since it was introduced on June 2, 2006.  
 Falling Rates  
 Demand for the country’s 91-day Treasury bills exceeded
supply at a sale yesterday, reducing the yield to the lowest in
at least four years following the cut in the interest rate.  
 “The reduction of central bank rate and the fall of
Treasury bill rates at yesterday’s auction is a signal the
market is expecting interest rates to fall further,”  Renaldo D’souza , an analyst at Nairobi’s Genghis Capital Ltd., said in
an interview.
