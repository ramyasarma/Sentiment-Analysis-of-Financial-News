             Mitsubishi Corp.  and  Sumitomo
Corp. ’s quarterly profit more than doubled after prices of coal,
for steelmaking and power generation climbed on demand growth
from China and India.  
 Mitsubishi’s  net income  rose to 140.4 billion yen ($1.63
billion) in the quarter ended June 30 from 67.8 billion yen a
year earlier, Japan’s biggest trading house said in a statement
to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Revenue rose 19.2 percent to 4.73
trillion yen. Sumitomo, the third-largest trader, reported
quarterly profit surged to 64.6 billion yen from 25 billion yen.  
 BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance, the world’s biggest
coking-coal exporter, agreed a 55 percent increase in the April-
June price for the material with JFE Holdings Inc.’s JFE Steel
unit. China’s robust demand also helped boost the price agreed
between Japanese steelmakers and the Australian supplier by 12.5
percent in the quarter started this month.  
 “Coal is a big  element  of Mitsubishi’s earnings and helped
bolster the company’s revenue and profit,”  Yasuhiro Narita , an
analyst at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo, said before today’s
announcement. “Mitsubishi should go ahead with aggressive
investment in the next couple of years.”  
 Coal as Driver  
 Shares of Mitsubishi fell 0.7 percent to 1,903 yen as of
2:15 p.m. Tokyo time after the earnings announcement, while
Sumitomo dipped 1.4 percent to 912 yen, tracking the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Mitsubishi and Sumitomo have lost 12
percent and 7.7 percent in the past six months,  compared  with
the 6.3 percent decline in the Nikkei.  
 Sumitomo’s  profit  from the natural resources and chemical
division rose 21 billion yen to 22.6 billion yen in the quarter,
equivalent to 35 percent of its overall net income, partly
because of ‘good’ coal business performance in Australia, the
statement said.  
 Mitsubishi maintained its full-year profit estimate at 370
billion yen for the year ending March 2011 on revenue of 18.8
trillion yen, the statement said. Sumitomo left its annual
profit outlook unchanged at 160 billion yen on revenue of 8.4
trillion yen.  
 “The 370 billion yen figure for Mitsubishi may be a bit
too conservative,” said Narita of Nomura, who expects profit to
exceed 450 billion yen for this fiscal year. Narita has a
“Buy” rating on the stock.  
 Mitsubishi plans to spend as much as 2.5 trillion yen in
the next three years on businesses such as metals, energy and
infrastructure to capitalize on growing demand from China, India
and Brazil, Chief Executive Officer  Ken Kobayashi  said on July
16.
