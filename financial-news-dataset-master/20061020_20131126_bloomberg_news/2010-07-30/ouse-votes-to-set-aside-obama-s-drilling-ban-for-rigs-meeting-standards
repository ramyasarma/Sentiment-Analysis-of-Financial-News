             The U.S. House adopted an amendment
to legislation overhauling offshore drilling rules that would
set aside the Obama administration moratorium on deep-water
exploration as rigs meet new safety standards.  
 The measure, sponsored by Representative Charles Melancon,
a Louisiana Democrat, would lift the July 12 suspension for
companies that meet requirements unveiled by Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican who opposes
the drilling pause, said the measure doesn’t go far enough.  
 While the proposal “sounds good,” it ultimately gives new
authority to Salazar to continue the drilling ban, Scalise said.  
 The amendment was adopted 216-195.
