             India, the second-biggest grower of
wheat and rice, suspended eight officials of the  Food Corp. of
India  after some grain stored at the state-owned company was
damaged by rains and floods, the farm minister said.  
 The loss is a result of “dereliction of duty” by Food
Corp. officials in proper storage and upkeep of food grains,
Minister  Sharad Pawar  said in a written reply to a question in
Parliament today, without quantifying the damage. Food Corp.,
owned entirely by the government, buys crops from farmers.  
 More than 11,700 metric tons of wheat and rice worth 68.6
million rupees ($1.5 million) were found damaged, Pawar said in
parliament on July 27. Maximum combined losses of the grains in
Punjab totaled 7,066 tons, 1,846 tons in West Bengal and 1,457
tons in Gujarat, according to figures submitted by Pawar.  
 The lack of silos and secure warehouses means state firms
often keep the produce in the open, exposing it to rains and
pests. The  country  requires 14 million tons of extra storage
capacity to stock wheat and rice, Pawar said July 13, adding
that Food Corp. would hire space from private companies this
year to accommodate record volumes bought from farmers.
