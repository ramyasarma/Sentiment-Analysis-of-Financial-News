             Bulgari SpA , the world’s third-
largest jeweler, fell as much as 3.6 percent in Milan after
reporting second-quarter profit that missed estimates and that
it may not meet its full-year gross-margin forecast.  
 The shares fell as much as 30 cents to 5.99 euros and
traded at 6 euros at 9:37 a.m., giving the Rome-based company a
market value of 1.81 billion euros ($2.4 billion.)  
 Bulgari, which is introducing more lower-priced jewelry and
more expensive men’s watches, is taking longer than peers to
recover from the recession as retailers continue clearing
inventories.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA , the world’s
largest maker of luxury goods, said July 27 that second-quarter
sales at its watch and jewelry unit increased 24 percent.  
 “We fail to find attraction in the shares at this level,”
 Thomas Chauvet , an analyst at Citigroup in London, wrote in a
note today. “Bulgari’s historical average operating margins of
15 percent are unlikely to be recovered by 2012.” Chauvet
maintained his “sell” rating on the stock.  
 Net income was 600,000 euros compared with a loss of 11.2
million euros a year earlier, the company said after markets
closed yesterday. The average  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was for 7.7 million euros. Bulgari may not reach
its 63 percent-gross margin forecast because of rising gold
prices and its geographic mix, Chief Executive Officer  Francesco Trapani  said in an interview yesterday. The margin was 61.1
percent in the second quarter.
