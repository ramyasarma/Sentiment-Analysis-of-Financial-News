             Crude oil increased, capping its
biggest monthly gain since March, as rallies in commodities led
by wheat and aluminum took the  S&P GSCI Commodity Index  to a 12-
week high.  
 Oil rebounded from a 2 percent intraday drop as wheat
jumped to the highest price in almost 14 months and aluminum
rose to an 11-week high. Futures also advanced after Syncrude
Canada Ltd. said it plans to start maintenance in September on a
unit at its upgrader in Alberta, Canada. Gasoline and heating
oil contracts expired, adding to volatility.  
 “All the other commodities were higher,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in Chicago. “You had the
expiration of the August contract and probably a bit of short-
covering as well.”  
 Crude for September delivery increased 59 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $78.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price rose $1.15 after 2 p.m. Futures gained 4.4
percent in July and 18 percent in the past year.  
 The S&P GSCI index jumped 1.2 percent to 524.809, the
highest level since May 4. The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19
commodities advanced 1.5 percent to 274.35, the strongest since
May 3. All 19 members of the index increased.  
 Syncrude Production  
 Canadian Oil Sands Trust , the largest owner of the Syncrude
joint venture, lowered its annual production forecast by 5
million barrels to 110 million barrels in a second-quarter
earnings report. It partially attributed the lower estimate to
the 45-day work on its 8-1 coker.  
 “That’s going to take 100,000 barrels a day of refinery-
grade crude out of the market,” said Carl Larry, president of
Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “Pile that onto the
fact that August should be a heavy month for maintenance in the
North Sea, and August and September will be tight months for
crude.”  
 Gasoline for August delivery rose 0.92 cent, or 0.4
percent, to expire at $2.1066 a gallon. The more-active
September contract increased 2.14 cents, or 1 percent, to settle
at $2.1224.  
 The dollar was little changed near a 12-week low against
the euro yesterday. A weak dollar boosts the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  
 The euro fell to $1.3052 as of 5 p.m. in New York, down
from $1.3079 yesterday. It touched $1.3107 in intraday trading
yesterday, the highest price since May 4.  
 GDP Growth  
 Earlier, oil touched $76.83 a barrel after U.S. economic
growth in the second quarter missed economists’ estimates, a
sign that fuel demand may be slow to rebound.  
 The contract tumbled on the Commerce Department report that
gross domestic product slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in
the three months to June as consumer spending growth slumped.
The figure was less than the 2.6 percent median forecast by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “What the GDP numbers are telling you, as many of the
other economic indicators that have come out during the past six
weeks have told us, is that we’re in a plateau,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank AG in
Washington. “What’s going on in supply and demand right now is
more supportive of prices near $70 than $90.”  
 The U.S. is the world’s biggest consumer of oil.  
 ‘Sold Off Too Hard’  
 Oil fell as low as $75.90 this week after the Energy
Department reported imports jumped to the highest level in
almost four years, causing supplies to climb.  
 U.S. oil inventories jumped 7.31 million barrels to 360.8
million in the week ended July 23, the biggest increase since
March 19, in the government report July 29. Analysts forecast a
drop to a four-month low.  
 “Prices sold off too hard and dropped below the 100-day
moving average of $78.25,” said  Hamza Khan , an analyst at the
Schork Group in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “Traders are just not
willing to give that point up.”  
 Prices erased some of their losses today after a measure of
business activity expanded in July more than forecast. The
Institute of Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its  business
barometer  rose to 62.3 this month. Readings higher than 50
signal growth.  
 The number “was really a blowout,” said  Matt Smith , a
commodities analyst for Summit Energy Inc. in Louisville,
Kentucky. “After that came out, crude had sort of made its lows
and began gradually getting more positive as the day went on.”  
 Steady on Week  
 Crude oil fell 3 cents this week, its smallest weekly move
in terms of actual price since December 2003. Futures haven’t
settled below $70 since May 25 or above $80 since May 4.  
 “We’re just covering the same ground over and over,” said
 Michael Fitzpatrick , vice president of energy at MF Global in
New York. “No new high was posted off the late-session rally.”  
 Brent crude for September settlement rose 59 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $78.18 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 415,491
contracts as of 5:15 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 562,163
contracts yesterday, 19 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.23 million contracts.

                          July 30 (Bloomberg) -- Nansen Saleri, chief executive officer of Quantum Reservoir Impact, talks with Bloomberg's Mark Crumpton about the outlook for BP Plc and the oil industry.
     U.S. Justice Department attorneys conducting a criminal probe of the BP Plc well explosion in the Gulf of Mexico have recommended that a grand jury be convened and BP managers subpoenaed to determine if any laws were broken, a person familiar with the investigation said.
