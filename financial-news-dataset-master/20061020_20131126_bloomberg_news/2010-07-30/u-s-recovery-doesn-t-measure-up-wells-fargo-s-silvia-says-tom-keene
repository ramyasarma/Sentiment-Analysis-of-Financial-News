             The U.S. economy isn’t recovering
fast enough to restore the level of jobs seen before the
recession started in December 2007, said  John Silvia , chief
economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in Charlotte, North Carolina.  
 “This is an economic recovery that doesn’t measure up to
the traditional standards of the traditional post-World War II
recovery,” Silvia said in a radio interview today with  Tom Keene  on “Bloomberg Surveillance.” “We don’t have the rebound
in manufacturing jobs or domestic jobs, especially in the
service sector, that we traditionally have.”  
 Total non-farm private employment  stood  at a seasonally
adjusted 107.7 million in June, down 7.9 million from December
2007, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  
 Growth in the U.S. slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in
the second quarter, less than forecast, reflecting a larger
trade deficit and an easing in consumer spending, the Commerce
Department reported today in Washington.  
 “Even at 2.5 percent growth, that’s not a fast enough pace
of growth to generate the jobs or generate the new housing or to
pay off all these entitlements that people have come to expect
as the quote, ‘old normal,’ for the U.S.,” said Silvia, 61, who
works at the company’s Wells Fargo Securities unit.  
 There have been gains in spending on business equipment and
software, Silvia said, and consumer activity has improved though
the market for commercial real estate remains weak.  
 Globalization and the aging of the generation of Americans
born after World War II have served as a drag on the pace of the
recovery, Silvia said.  
 “The reality is we are coming to the retirement of the
Baby Boom,” Silvia said.  
 Entrepreneurs and small businesses are increasingly seeing
the potential for higher rates of return on ventures outside of
the U.S., Silvia said. “America’s still growing and still a
great country but in terms of opportunities, we can look
elsewhere,” he said.
