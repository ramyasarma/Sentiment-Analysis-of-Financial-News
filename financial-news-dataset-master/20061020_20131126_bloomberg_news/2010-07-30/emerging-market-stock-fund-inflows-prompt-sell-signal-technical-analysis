             Emerging-market stocks are poised to
fall after developing-nation equity funds had the second-biggest
inflows this year, exceeding a level that preceded previous
selloffs, according to BofA-Merrill Lynch Global Research.  
 Investors poured $3.2 billion into emerging-market funds in
the past week, bringing four-week inflows to about 1.5 percent
of their total assets under management,  Michael Hartnett , BofA’s
chief global equity strategist in New York, wrote in a report
today, citing data from EPFR Global.  
 That triggered a sell signal from Hartnett’s fund flows
“trading rule,” which says four-week inflows totaling at least
1.5 percent of assets under management may foreshadow market
declines. The last sell signal on April 28 was followed by a 9.2
percent decline in the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  the following
month. Similar signals in April 2008, July 2007, September 2007
and April 2006 also predicted market drops within about four
weeks, according to Hartnett.  
 “Today, compared to April, consensus is less bullish on
the global economy and less positioned in global equity
markets,” Hartnett wrote. “But the trading rule strongly
predicts relative underperformance by emerging markets in
August. We continue to predict medium-term outperformance by
emerging-market equities.”  
 The MSCI emerging gauge has climbed 7.8 percent this month
as European bank stress tests and U.S.  earnings  reports boosted
investor confidence in the global economic recovery. The gauge
declined 0.5 percent to 989.26 at 8:04 a.m. in New York, the
first retreat in nine days.  
 Some strategists use fund inflows as a contrary indicator
because they may signal investors with a positive view of
the market have already purchased shares.
