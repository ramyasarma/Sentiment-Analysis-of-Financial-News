             Klaus Ernst, a co-leader of
Germany’s anti-capitalist Left Party, is paid almost 17,000
euros per month, drives a Porsche and has a holiday house in
Austria, Bild newspaper reported.  
 As a Bundestag lawmaker, Ernst gets 7,668 euros salary plus
tax-free expenses of about 4,000 euros a month, with a further
3,500 euros paid by his party, Bild said. His co-leader Gesine
Loetzsch doesn’t accept the party payment, it said. Ernst
receives an additional 1,913 euros a month from his
parliamentary group, Bild said.  
 “I don’t have to be poor to fight poverty,” Bild cited
Ernst as saying in an interview. Before he became party leader,
Ernst combined his job as a lower-house lawmaker with a part-
time role at the IG Metall union, earning “clearly more,” than
he currently does, Ernst said, according to Bild.  
 Left Party policies include a “wealth tax,” the
nationalization of banks, state-mandated “low interest rates”
and the immediate withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan.
They have 76 lawmakers in the 622-member Bundestag.
