             Some Standard & Poor’s indexes of
Canadian stocks, including the S&P/TSX Composite Index, failed
to update between 11:37 a.m. and 12:42 p.m. Toronto time today,
according to Bloomberg data.  
 Trading of Canadian stocks continued normally during the
period, yet the indexes were not calculating correctly, said TSX
spokeswoman  Carolyn Quick . S&P is investigating the cause of the
breakdown, she said.  
 In a statement, S&P blamed “technical difficulties” for
the halt.  
 Other indexes halted today included the S&P/TSX 60 index of
larger companies and the S&P/TSX Smallcap Index.  
 S&P spokesmen  Tony North  and  David R. Guarino  couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.
