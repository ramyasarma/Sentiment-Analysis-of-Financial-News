             North Dakota  overtook  Oklahoma  this
week as the third-most active state in drilling for oil and
natural gas, according to data published by Baker Hughes Inc.  
 The number of North Dakota rigs exploring for and producing
oil and gas jumped by two to 128, Baker Hughes said. Oklahoma
fell by nine to 123, the biggest drop among the states. Oklahoma
is home to the oil delivery hub for the U.S. Midcontinent.  
 Drilling in the Bakken Shale in North Dakota’s Williston
Basin, aided by technical advances in extracting fuel from shale
formations, helped make the state the fourth-largest oil
producer as of March, behind Texas, Alaska and California,
according to  data  from the Energy Department in Washington. It
accounted for 4.6 percent of total U.S. output.  
 “What you’re seeing is continued interest in producing out
of the Bakken,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC, a consulting company based in Houston. “There’s
been a significant increase in North Dakota, whereas Oklahoma
production was virtually unchanged over the past two years.”  
 North Dakota pumped 251,000 barrels a day on average in
March, up 29 percent from the year before and up 74 percent from
2008, according to the Energy Department. Oklahoma output
averaged 184,000 barrels a day in March, little changed from
183,000 in 2009 and 186,000 in 2008.  
 More than 95 percent of North Dakota wells are targeting
oil trapped in two hard, impermeable rock formations, Bakken and
Three Forks, Lynn Helms, director of the state’s Department of
Mineral Resources, said in a July 17 statement posted on the
department’s website. Oil and gas flowed to market through 4,893
wells in May, a record for the state, he said.  
 ‘Unconventional’ Field  
 Bakken “is an unconventional oilfield,” said  Gary Flaharty , director of investor relations at Houston-based Baker
Hughes. “It’s a new play that because of the advancement in
technology is now a viable play.”  
 The combined U.S. oil and gas rig count rose by one this
week to 1,586, the highest level since January 2009. The count
touched a 22-year high in 2008, peaking at 2,031.  
 Oil rigs jumped by 12 to 603, the highest level since
January 1991. Gas rigs declined by 10 to 972. Oil rigs
constituted 38 percent of the rig total, the highest percentage
in 11 years.  
 Miscellaneous rigs, which primarily drill for geothermal
energy, fell by one to 11.  
 Rigs on land declined by one to 1,556, and rigs in inland
waters were unchanged at 14. Offshore drilling increased by two
to 16 rigs, echoing the gain in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Canadian rigs jumped by 14, or 4 percent, to 363.
