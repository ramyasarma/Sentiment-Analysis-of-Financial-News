             Telecom Corp. , New Zealand’s biggest
telephone company, said it raised A$140 million ($126 million)
from the sale of Australian assets, including a stake in iiNet
Ltd. and the consumer unit of its AAPT Ltd. subsidiary.  
 Telecom sold about 27.6 million shares in iiNet for about
A$70 million, the Auckland-based company said in a statement
today. Separately it agreed today to sell the AAPT unit to iiNet
for A$60 million, following the disposal of a stake in Macquarie
Telecom yesterday for A$9.9 million.  
 Telecom in April said it was prepared to sell AAPT,
Australia’s third-biggest telephone company, as its focus moves
to arresting a slide in earnings and its role in the New Zealand
government’s broadband plan. AAPT will be retained as a
wholesale and corporate business, Telecom Chief Executive
Officer  Paul Reynolds  said today.  
 “These transactions rationalize non-core assets,
strengthen Telecom’s financial position, and help reposition
AAPT’s operations into a focused, network-centric wholesale and
corporate business that is well-positioned for future growth,”
Reynolds said in the statement.  
 Telecom  shares  rose 1 cent to NZ$2.00 at 2.10 p.m. in
Wellington trading, narrowing their decline the past six months
to 15 percent.  
 The sale of AAPT’s consumer unit is expected to reduce
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization by
A$10 million in the year ending June 30, 2011, Telecom said
today. The sale of the iiNet stake generated A$11 million less
than the carrying value of the investment, it said.
