             Tim Tebow , the 2007 Heisman Trophy
winner, signed with the Denver Broncos in time for the National
Football League team’s training camp.  
 The Broncos didn’t disclose terms in announcing the deal on
their website. Former University of Florida quarterback Tebow,
selected 25th overall in April’s draft, signed a five-year,
$11.25 million contract with $8.7 million guaranteed, ESPN said,
citing people familiar with the transaction it didn’t identify.  
 “He works hard and he’s got all the intangibles that you
look for in a player at that position,” Broncos coach Josh
Daniels said on the website. “He’s produced a lot of numbers
and statistically -- I’m not even going to talk about that
because he’s one of the best in a long, long time.”  
 Tebow, 22, owns five National Collegiate Athletic
Association, 14 Southeastern Conference and 28 University of
Florida records. He threw for 9,285 yards and 88 touchdowns
during his four seasons with the Gators.  
 During his last college football game, he set Sugar Bowl
and Bowl Championship Series records with 533 yards of total
offense, 482 yards passing and a completion percentage of 88.6.  
 “I am excited about this challenge of playing in the NFL
and trying to be an NFL quarterback,” Tebow said.
