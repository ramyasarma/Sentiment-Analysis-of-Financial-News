             HeidelbergCement AG , the world’s
largest maker of aggregates used to produce concrete and
asphalt, said  sales  rose for the first time in six quarters as a
rebound in the global economy revived demand.  
 Sales in the quarter ended June 30 rose 9.5 percent to 3.3
billion euros ($4.3 billion), while operating profit rose 9.1
percent to 693 million euros, beating the mean  estimates  of 3.15
billion euros for sales and 673.8 million euros for profit in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 “Demand for our building materials noticeably improved in
the second quarter,” Chief Executive Officer  Bernd Scheifele 
said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales volumes for its main
products, cement, aggregates, and ready-mix concrete, all rose
in the quarter.  
 Sales and operating income will rise  this year , Scheifele
said on a conference call, without giving details. The
recovery’s strength and the impact of budget-deficit reduction
on infrastructure spending are still unclear, the CEO said.  
 Rival Lafarge SA today cut its outlook for cement demand in
the company’s markets in 2010. Cemex SAB of Mexico, the largest
cement maker in the Americas, posted a loss on July 27 for a
third straight quarter. Dublin-based CRH Plc’s first-half
earnings missed its forecast amid a decline in the U.S.  
 Costs, Debt  
 Scheifele remains focused on cutting costs and debt, while
completing a four-year, 20 million metric-ton expansion of
production capacity in countries such as Poland and Russia by
2012. He widened his 2010 cost-cutting target by 50 percent to
300 million euros in February after financing and other costs
slashed profit 98 percent last year. The company said today it
achieved 124 million euros of the cost-cutting goal by June 30.  
 The company cut 3,239  jobs , or 5.7 percent of its
workforce, in the 12 months through June, and is in the process
of eliminating as many as 350 positions in North America.  
 Second-quarter net income for the Heidelberg, Germany-based
company fell 64 percent to 120 million euros, as a year earlier
it had a gain from selling a stake in Indonesia’s second-largest
cement maker as well as a tax gain. Net income trailed the mean
 estimate  of 207.7 million euros in the Bloomberg survey.  
 Net debt at June 30 was 9.07 billion euros, up from 8.96
billion euros on March 31. The company will fail to achieve
credit metrics that would qualify it for investment-grade credit
rating this year, Chief Financial Officer  Lorenz Naeger  said on
the call.  
 HeidelbergCement  shares  ended a seven-day winning stretch,
dropping 3.4 percent to 38.645 euros at market close in
Frankfurt today. The stock has tumbled 20 percent this year,
valuing the company at 7.2 billion euros.
