             Coffee futures may jump 13 percent
to the highest price since 1997 after completing a bull-flag
formation in the past month, according to  Jim Stellakis , an
independent analyst, and  Robin Rosenberg , a futures and options
strategist at PFG Best.  
 The attached chart shows the commodity surged to a 12-year
high of $1.765 a pound in New York on June 24, traded in a range
between $1.55 and $1.70 for a month, and then jumped to settle
above $1.70 yesterday for the first time since February 1998.
Coffee may rally to $2 in a month after yesterday’s close, said
Stellakis, a former strategist at Touradji Capital Management.  
 “In a bull-flag pattern, the market shoots up, rests, and
takes another move higher,” said Stellakis, the founder of
Technical Alpha, a New York-based research firm. “In an extreme
case, $2 can be the target, while a close below $1.68 could slow
the advance or reverse it.”  
 A rise to $2 would be the highest price for a most-active
contract since Aug. 11, 1997. Yesterday, coffee futures for
September delivery jumped 5.65 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $1.7305
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Traders including  Ralph Hawes , the head of Sucden Financial Ltd.’s coffee desk in
London, cited fund purchases and technical buying.  
 The commodity rose again today, gaining as much as 3.3
percent to $1.7875, the highest price since February 1998.
Coffee was trading at $1.7405 at 9:55 a.m. on ICE.  
 “My best guess is to buy coffee on weakness” now that
“this flag follows through,” said Rosenberg, PFG’s head soft-
markets analyst in Chicago.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
