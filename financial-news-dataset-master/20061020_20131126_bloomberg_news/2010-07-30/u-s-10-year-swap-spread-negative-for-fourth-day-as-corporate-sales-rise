             U.S. 10-year interest-rate swap
spreads were negative for a fourth day as corporate debt
issuance surges and the rate banks charge each other for dollar
loans declines.  
 The  rate  to exchange floating- for fixed-interest payments
for 10 years  fell  below the comparable-maturity  Treasury  yield
by as many as 4.38 basis points, the least since April 15. The
spread widened 0.5 basis point to negative 2.25 basis points at
10:25 a.m. in New York. The spread turned negative for the first
time in March.  
 U.S. corporate bond sales soared 31 percent to $85.7
billion this month, the busiest July on record, as yields fell
to the lowest in more than six years on growing investor
confidence in the economic recovery. The London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, which banks say they can borrow at for
three months in dollars, fell the most today in almost 11
months, dropping to the least since May 14.  
 “There has been corporate issuance, which is very often a
part of the reason why swap spreads narrow, with firms that
hedge out their issuance into swaps tending to be the financial
corporations,” said  Suvrat Prakash,  a strategist in New York at
BNP Paribas SA. “Swap spreads overall are on a one-way path
downward, which will likely keep going as Libor rates should
continue to fall.”  
 Libor dropped to 0.454 percent from 0.466 percent
yesterday, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the biggest decline since Sept. 1, 2009. The dollar Libor-OIS
spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, narrowed to 26.4
basis points, down about 24 percent from its high this year of
about 34 basis points on July 15.  
 ‘Should Never Happen’  
 “Some people have likely been caught up by the dip in the
10-year Treasury yield below 3 percent,” said  Michael Shaoul, 
chief executive officer of New York-based Oscar Gruss & Son
Inc., in an interview. “In theory, a negative swap spread
should never happen. However, we know from the 30-year spread
staying negative that this doesn’t have to be catastrophic.”  
 The 30-year swap spread turned negative for the first time
in October 2008 and had mostly traded below zero since January
2009. The spread widened 1.56 basis points to negative 30.25
basis points today.  
 Swap rates are typically higher than Treasury yields as the
floating payments are based on interest rates, such as Libor,
that contain credit risk. Sovereign debt is usually viewed as
less risky.
