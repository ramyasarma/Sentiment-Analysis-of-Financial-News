             Police in Niger arrested  Seini Oumarou , a former prime minister under ousted President  Mamadou Tandja , over allegations of embezzlement, his party said.  
 Oumarou is being held in the capital, Naimey, Issoufou
Tamboura, the secretary of communication of the National
Movement for Development Corporation, known as the MNSD, told
Bloomberg late yesterday. Oumarou, the MNSD president, is
suspected of embezzling almost 300 million Central African
Republic Francs ($598,000), according to newspaper reports in
Niger.  
 Three other members of the government under Tandja are
being held by the police in Niamey, an unidentified police
spokesman said.  
 They include  Mahamadou Salissou Habi , a former minister,
Gouro Soumana, the former secretary-general of the ministry of
trade and Ado Mahamane, a national director of hydrocarbons. The
former ministers were cited by a commission created by the
ruling military junta to fight economic crimes.  
 Tandja was deposed by the military in February after he
sought to extend his term by changing the constitution.  
 One of his sons, Hadiatoulaye Tandja, has been in jail
since June after being charged with “money laundering,
corruption and influence peddling.”
