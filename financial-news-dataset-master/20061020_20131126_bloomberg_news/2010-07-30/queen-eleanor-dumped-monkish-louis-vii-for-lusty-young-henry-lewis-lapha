             Powerful enough to do as she
pleased, Eleanor of Aquitaine was notorious in her own time.  
 Eager to wed the sexy, red-haired Henry of Anjou, 12 years
her junior, she persuaded her husband, the pious King Louis VII
of France, to annul their marriage, but didn’t tell him why.  
 Henry meanwhile, desiring her and her lands, ignored his
father, who forbade “him in any wise to touch her, both because
she was the wife of his lord and because he had known her
himself.” On May 18, 1152, the pair took vows in furtive haste.  
 When the French king heard about the union, he declared
war. It took six weeks for Henry to triumph, establishing him as
the most powerful ruler on the continent. In two years, he also
ascended the throne of England and set Europe’s path for
centuries to come.  
 In their long and turbulent union, the royal pair produced
a brood of Plantagenets, two of whom became kings. Eleanor’s
blood still flows in the veins of  Queen Elizabeth II . (Their
senior years infuse “The Lion in Winter” with Katherine
Hepburn and Peter O’Toole.)  
 I spoke with  Alison Weir , biographer of Eleanor and author
of a new novel about her, “ Captive Queen ,” on the following
topics:  
 1. “Married to a Monk, Not a King”  
 2. Lust at First Sight: Henry of Anjou  
 3. Sex and Power  
 4. Fiction vs. Chronicle  
 5. Scandalous Queen
