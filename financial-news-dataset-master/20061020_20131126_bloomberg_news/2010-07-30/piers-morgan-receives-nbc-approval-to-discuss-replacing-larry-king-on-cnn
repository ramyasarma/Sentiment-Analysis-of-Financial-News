             Piers Morgan , the “America’s Got
Talent” judge, has been given approval by NBC to hold
negotiations with  Time Warner Inc. ’s CNN to replace talk-show
host Larry King.  
 NBC relaxed Morgan’s exclusivity agreement to allow him to
talk to CNN,  Jeff Gaspin , chairman of NBC Universal Television
Entertainment, said today at a Television Critics Association
event in Los Angeles.  Joe Schlosser , an NBC spokesman, confirmed
Gaspin’s comments.  
 NBC’s consent was needed before CNN could begin negotiating
directly with Morgan, because he is under contract as a judge
for the broadcaster’s most-watched reality TV program. Morgan is
the former editor of the Daily Mirror in the U.K.  
 CNN, the 24-hour cable news network, is in need of a host
that can reinvigorate the 9 p.m. hour occupied by “Larry King
Live” after viewers defected to rival networks such as Fox
News. King, who interviewed presidents and Hollywood big shots
on CNN for the last 25 years, is stepping down in the fourth
quarter of this year.  
 Barbara Levin , a spokeswoman for CNN, declined to comment.  
 “Larry King Live,” which is in the “Guinness Book of
World Records” as the longest-running show with the same host
in the same time slot, had a 40 percent ratings decline this
year through June, according to data from researcher Nielsen Co.  
 Time Warner rose 20 cents to $31.46 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have climbed 8
percent this year. Fairfield, Connecticut-based  General Electric
Co. , the parent of NBC Universal, fell 3 cents to $16.12.
