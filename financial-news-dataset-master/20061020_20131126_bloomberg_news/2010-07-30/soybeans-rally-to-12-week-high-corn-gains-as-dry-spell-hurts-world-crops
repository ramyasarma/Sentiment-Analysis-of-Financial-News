             Soybeans jumped to a three-month
high and corn rose for a third day as hot, dry weather damaged
crops from Russia to Germany, boosting demand for supplies from
the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter.  
 Russia, the seventh-largest feed-grain exporter and oilseed
 processor , declared emergencies in 27 crop-producing regions,
four more than a week ago, as drought harmed crops across at
least 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres). German grain
production will fall as much as 11 percent to 44 million metric
tons from last year, Alfred C. Toepfer International GmbH said.  
 “People have underestimated the damage and the crops are
still shrinking,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “There is a
tightening global supply, and that means more U.S. exports.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery surged 17 cents, or
1.7 percent, to close at $10.05 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after rising to $10.07, the highest
price since April 27. The most-active contract gained 2.4
percent for the week and 11 percent in July, the biggest monthly
rally since May 2009.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 13 cents, or 3.3
percent, to close at $4.0675 a bushel on the CBOT, after
touching $4.07, the highest level since July 16. Corn advanced
5.8 percent for the week and 8.9 percent in July, the largest
monthly increase since February.  
 Weather Threat  
 Prices also rose as heat and excessive rain threaten U.S.
crops, Schultz said.  
 From Texas to Pennsylvania, temperatures will be as much as
6 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal over the next two weeks,
increasing stress on plants, said  Gail Martell , the president of
MartellCropProjections.com in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin.  
 In the Midwest, the main U.S. growing region, the total
rainfall during the past two months was probably the highest
since 1960, after as much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain
moved east from South Dakota to Illinois in the past 24 hours,
said  Mike Tannura , the president of T-Storm Weather in Chicago.  
 The data point to the warmest and wettest June-July period
since 1960, Tannura said today in a report to clients. With
forecasts for a hot August, there is increasing potential for
large swings in yields, he said.  
 “Too much rain and warm evening temperatures have caused
widely variable crop conditions across the Midwest and in
individual fields,” Northstar Commodity’s Schultz said.  “It’s
still going to be a good crop, but not as big as farmers were
hoping for just three weeks ago.”  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
