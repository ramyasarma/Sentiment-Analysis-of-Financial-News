             Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s personal assets rose by as much as 31 percent last
year as U.S. stocks rebounded.  
 The central bank chief and his family owned financial
assets valued at $1.15 million to $2.48 million last year, a
higher range than the $852,000 to $1.9 million in 2008,
according to an annual financial disclosure released by the Fed
today. The forms from the Office of Government Ethics require
officials to report only a range in the value of holdings.  
 Bernanke’s two largest assets are retirement accounts,
listed as TIAA Traditional and CREF Stock Large Cap Blend. Both
were valued in a range of $500,001 and $1 million. Last year,
his CREF fund holding was listed in a range of $250,001 and
$500,000.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 23 percent in 2009
after a 38 percent drop in 2008. Bernanke has fought the worst
U.S. recession and financial crisis since the 1930s by lowering
the benchmark U.S. interest rate to zero and having the Fed
purchase $1.7 trillion of housing debt and Treasury securities.  
 The S&P 500 declined 1.2 percent this year through
yesterday.  
 Bernanke, 56, who succeeded  Alan Greenspan  as chairman in
2006 and began a second four-year term in February, received a
salary last year of $196,700, an amount set by Congress.  
 A former Princeton professor, Bernanke earned between
$200,002 and $2 million in royalties from textbooks last year,
more than his compensation as central bank chief.  
 $1 Million  
 Fed governors  Daniel Tarullo , a law professor at Georgetown
University before joining the Fed, and  Elizabeth Duke  and  Kevin Warsh , both former bankers, also have assets of more than $1
million, according to the disclosures.  
 Earlier this week, the Senate Banking Committee approved
the nomination of San Francisco Fed President  Janet Yellen  to be
vice-chairman of the Fed. The panel also approved Massachusetts
Institute of Technology professor  Peter Diamond  and Maryland’s
commissioner of financial regulation,  Sarah Bloom Raskin , for
spots on the Fed board.  
 Previously released financial disclosures show that all
three have combined assets of at least $1 million with their
spouses. If confirmed by the Senate, the entire Fed board will
consist of millionaires.
