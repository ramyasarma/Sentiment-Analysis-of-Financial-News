             Colombia’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a four-year low, on speculation the South American
nation will be raised to investment grade, luring foreign
investors to the country’s financial assets.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.42
percent at 2:43 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. That’s the lowest level since March 2006. The
bond’s price rose 0.514 centavo to 124.629 centavos per peso.  
 Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which rates Colombia
BB+, or one level below investment grade, on July 7 raised its
outlook on the country’s credit rating to positive from stable.
The move follows comments from  Alessandra Alecci , an analyst
with Moody’s Investors Service, who said in a June 30 interview
that the agency is “optimistic” on Colombia and that there is
“potential” for the country to move toward investment grade.
Moody’s rates Colombia’s foreign debt Ba1, or one level below
investment grade. It has a stable outlook on the rating.  
 “There has been a change in risk perception towards
Colombia,” said  Felipe Campos , head analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Alianza Valores. “Expectations of investment grade
have created a snowball effect as people want to invest in
Colombia, driving the peso, bonds and stocks higher.”  
 Yields on the 2020 peso bonds have fallen 93 basis points
since May 18 while the IGBC Index and Colcap Index rose to
record levels this week.  
 ‘Asks for Actions’  
 The peso was little changed at 1,843.5 per U.S. dollar,
from 1,843.25 yesterday. The peso rose 11 percent in 2010, the
best performance among world currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The currency strengthened 1.3 percent this week and 3.1 percent
in July.  
 The Association of Colombian Flower Exporters in a
statement today titled “Flower Growers Ask Where Is Banco de la
Republica” asked the central bank to intervene in the currency
market as the strengthening peso cuts exporter revenue.  
 “The flower industry asks for actions to avoid the loss of
hundreds of jobs,”  Augusto Solano , president of the association
known as Asocolflores, was cited as saying in the statement.  
 The flower industry overall lost 14,000 jobs in the past
five years because of the peso rally and stands to lose another
12,000 in companies that have filed for bankruptcy protection,
Asocolflores said in April. The industry employs more than
225,000 people, according to the statement.  
 Central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe  told reporters after
the bank’s July 23 monetary policy meeting that Banco de la
Republica “has never ruled out intervening in the market
again.” The bank purchased $20 million a day between March 3
and June 30 to curb a rally policy makers said left the peso
“misaligned.”
