             Cattle rose, capping the biggest
monthly gain in a year, amid signs that shrinking U.S. herds and
lighter animals are limiting beef supplies. Hogs also gained.  
 Steer carcasses in the U.S.  weighed  about 859 pounds (389
kilograms) in the first three days of this week, or 2.9 percent
less than a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. The U.S. cattle herd on July 1 was the smallest for the
date since at least 1973 as losses in the last two years spurred
farmers to cut output.  
 “The herd is continuing to see some liquidation,” said
 David Kruse , the president of CommStock Investments Inc. in
Royal, Iowa. “The supply side is pretty well managed.”  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 1.125 cents, or
1.2 percent, to close at 94.6 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This month, the price gained 5.1
percent, the most since July 2009.  
 By tomorrow, meatpackers will have processed 654,000 head
of cattle this week, down 1.8 percent from a week earlier,
according to USDA estimates.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement were unchanged
at $1.13725 a pound. Futures for September settlement fell 0.075
cent to $1.142.  
 Hogs, Pork Bellies  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.95 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 79.025 cents a pound. The price has gained 50
percent in the past year as U.S. farmers slashed herds and pork
demand recovered from the recession and swine flu.  
 Yesterday, the  wholesale price  of pork bellies, used to
make bacon, extended a rally to $1.3333 a pound, the highest
level since at least January 1998, according to USDA data.  
 Stockpiles of  pork bellies  in warehouses monitored by the
CME have tumbled 73 percent from a year earlier. Futures have
surged 70 percent in the past 12 months.  
 “There’s nothing to say that the rally’s over with, and we
may end up with a similar situation in  hams ,” Kruse said.
“This fall, with less in cold storage and with hog numbers not
what they have been, we could see a better ham market ahead.”
