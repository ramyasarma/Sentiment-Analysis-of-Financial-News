             Hitachi Ltd. , Japan’s No.3 company
by sales, posted a third consecutive quarterly profit as China’s
economic growth and the recovery in the U.S. fueled demand for
products ranging from auto components to hydraulic excavators.  
 Net income  at the Tokyo-based  maker  of nuclear power plants,
construction machinery, factory equipment and home appliances
was 86.1 billion yen ($996 million) in the three months ended
June 30, compared with an 82.7 billion yen loss a year earlier,
the company said today in a statement. That’s almost four times
the 23 billion yen profit average of three analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Higher capital spending by electronics makers and
semiconductor manufacturers contributed to a 23 percent increase
in sales at the electronics devices division, Hitachi said.
Revenue at the automotive systems division rose 38 percent, it
said.  
 First-quarter operating profit was 88.5 billion yen,
compared with a loss of 50.6 billion yen a year earlier, the
company said. Sales rose 14 percent to 2.15 trillion yen.  
 Hitachi  fell 2 percent to close at 352 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange before the announcement. Shares of the company
have gained 24 percent this year, outperforming the benchmark
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  which declined 9.6 percent.  
 The company raised its first-half net income forecast by 82
percent to 100 billion yen and increased its operating profit
estimate by 36 percent. Hitachi expects sales in the period to
total 4.4 trillion yen, 2.3 percent more than its May projection.
