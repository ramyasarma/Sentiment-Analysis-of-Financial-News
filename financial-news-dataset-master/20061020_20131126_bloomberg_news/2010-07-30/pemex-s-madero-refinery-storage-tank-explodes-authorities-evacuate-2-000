             About 2,000 people were evacuated by
Mexican authorities after an explosion and fire at a coker unit
gasoline storage tank at Petroleos Mexicanos’s Francisco I.
Madero refinery on the Gulf of Mexico.  
 The blaze was under control at 6:30 p.m. local time
yesterday, said a Pemex spokesman, who asked not to be identified
in accordance with company policy. No other facilities at the
refinery were damaged, he said.  
 The people were moved by authorities in the Tampico area
after the blast and are likely to start returning to their homes
within hours, the spokesman for the state-owned oil company said.  
 The  refinery  has a capacity to process 195,000 barrels of
crude a day, according data compiled by Bloomberg.
