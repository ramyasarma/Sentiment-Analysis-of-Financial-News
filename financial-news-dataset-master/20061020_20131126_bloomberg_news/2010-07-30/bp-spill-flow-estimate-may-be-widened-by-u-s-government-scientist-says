             The Obama administration, which
plans within a few days to announce a new determination for how
much oil  BP Plc ’s leaking Gulf of Mexico well was spewing, may
widen the range of its estimate because of difficulties
assessing the flow, said a scientist involved in the research.  
 “There’s just a lot of uncertainty because there was no
monitoring system put in place,” said Ira Leifer, a University
of California, Santa Barbara researcher and a member of panel of
scientists consulting the U.S. Energy Department on the spill.  
 At stake are numbers that could be used to help determine
London-based BP’s penalty for the largest U.S. oil spill on
record. Federal law requires that companies that spill oil into
the ocean pay a per-barrel fine. The amount per barrel depends
on whether the spill involves gross negligence.  
 BP ’s Macondo well, which began leaking after an April 20
drilling-rig explosion that killed 11 workers, was releasing
35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf, the
government  said  on June 15. National Incident Commander  Thad Allen  said today that a new flow estimate -- together with data
on how much oil evaporated and how much has been dispersed --
will be released within a few days.  
 Leifer, speaking today in a telephone interview, said his
estimate was toward the high end of the previously announced
range. He declined to disclose the figure, citing government
policy. The administration asked Leifer and other scientists in
the Flow Rate Technical Group to submit new estimates after
reviewing research from all members of the panel.  
 BP  sealed Macondo from above the well on July 15, stopping
the flow of oil. The company is drilling a relief well to
permanently plug Macondo.
