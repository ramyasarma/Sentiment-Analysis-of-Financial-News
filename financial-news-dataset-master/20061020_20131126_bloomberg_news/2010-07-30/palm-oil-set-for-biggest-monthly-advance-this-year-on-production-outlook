             Palm oil futures are set for first
monthly gain this year on speculation that supply from the
world’s biggest producing nations may be less than expected on
La Nina weather and as soybean oil climbed.  
 Prices have increased 5.6 percent this month, the biggest
monthly advance since February. October-delivery futures fell
0.7 percent to 2,496 ringgit ($784) a metric ton at 4:39 p.m. on
the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange as crude oil extended losses,
erasing a gain of as much as 1 percent earlier.  
 Palm oil has rebounded 10 percent from a seven-month low on
July 7 on speculation demand may rise among Asian countries and
as weather threatens to disrupt output in the biggest producers.
China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia mark important festivals in
the quarter ending September, with communal meals stoking edible
oils consumption.  
 “Weather has been the biggest concern for the market and
it will remain so for a while,”  Arhnue Tan , an analyst at ECM
Libra Capital Sdn. “If La Nina indeed affects harvest, then we
could see prices moving up.”  
 La Nina, which brings above-normal rainfall in Asia, can
disrupt palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia, the top
growers, and cause dry weather in North America, hurting soybean
crops. Palm and soybean oils are substitutes and account for
more than 60 percent of global edible oils supplies and demand.  
 Output is “highly likely” to fall short of expectations
in the second half, providing strong support for crude palm oil
prices, UOB Kay Hian Pte. said in a report on July 27.  
 ‘Strong Demand’  
 “Demand for palm oil has been quite strong as well and the
stockpile statistics from Malaysia for July will be a key factor
in the coming weeks,” ECM Libra’s Tan said.  
 Palm oil stockpiles in Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest
producer, touched a 10-month low of 1.45 million tons in June,
the board said July 12. Shipments advanced 5.5 percent to 1.44
million tons last month, it said.  
 Exports dropped 4.1 percent in the first 25 days of July to
1,074,329 tons from the same period in June, surveyor Intertek
said on July 25. Sales fell 0.9 percent to 1,103,439 tons, rival
Societe Generale de Surveillance said.  
 “With demand still likely to outpace supply, industry
watchers expect a draw down in inventory levels,”  Carey Wong ,
an analyst at OCBC Investment Research in Singapore, said in a
report today. “It is too early to say whether the La Nina
phenomenon, which is causing heavier than usual rainfall in Asia,
will persist until the end of the year.”  
 Soybean oil advanced 7.3 percent this month, the biggest
monthly gain in five months. The vegetable oil’s  premium  over
palm oil widened to $92.47 a ton from $91.8 yesterday, according
to Bloomberg data. November-delivery soybeans rose as much as
0.8 percent to $9.955 a bushel.  
 CME Group Inc.’s October-delivery palm oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, fell 0.9 percent to $786 a ton.
On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil rose
0.3 percent to 6,740 yuan ($1,002) a ton, for a gain of 1.7
percent for the week. Soybean oil climbed 0.2 percent to 7,692
yuan a ton and posted a weekly increase of 0.9 percent.
