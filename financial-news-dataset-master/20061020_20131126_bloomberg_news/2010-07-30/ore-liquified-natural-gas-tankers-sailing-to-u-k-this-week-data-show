             The number of liquefied natural gas
carriers sailing to the U.K. rose in the last week, ship-
tracking data show.  
 Britain, Europe’s biggest gas market, is to receive four
cargoes, double the number of tankers a week ago, according to
AISLive data on Bloomberg. A fifth ship is also heading to the
U.K., the Milford Haven Port Authority website shows.  
 August is a month of heavy North Sea and Norwegian
maintenance, raising demand for tanker-borne gas. Almost a half
of the U.K.’s electricity is generated by burning gas.  
 Five LNG tankers are sailing to Taiwan, one more than seven
days ago.  
 The U.S., the world’s largest gas market, is scheduled to
receive two vessels, down from four last week.  
 Japan, the world’s biggest buyer of LNG, will receive 22
cargoes, the same as last week. The number of tankers sailing to
South Korea, the second-biggest user, fell to 10 from 12.  
 Signals were captured today from 182 tankers, 6 more than
July 23, or 55 percent of the global fleet of 332 LNG carriers.  
 LNG is natural gas chilled to minus 162 degrees Celsius
(minus 260 Fahrenheit), putting it in a liquid state for
shipping by tanker. The following table lists by country of
destination all the tankers that have transmitted at time of
arrival within the next three months, including today.
