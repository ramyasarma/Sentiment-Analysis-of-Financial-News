             Lojas Renner SA , Brazil’s biggest
publicly traded clothing retailer, climbed to a record after
second-quarter profit surged 90 percent, beating analysts’
estimates.  
 The shares rose the most in two months, gaining 8.2 percent
to 58.96 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 4 p.m.
New York time.  
 Net income rose to 91 million reais ($51.8 million) from a
year earlier, Renner said in a regulatory filing yesterday after
markets closed. Ten analysts in a Bloomberg survey had an
average estimate of 74.3 million reais in profit.  
 The results were “better than our bullish estimates,”
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by  Andrea Teixeira  wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. Renner benefited from growing credit
demand as Brazil’s economy recovered from last year’s recession,
the analysts said.  
 Central bank minutes published yesterday said growth may
have slowed to “sustainable” levels, signaling policy makers
may raise interest rates less than previously expected.  
 JPMorgan reiterated its “overweight” rating on the stock,
saying Renner is now its “top pick” among Brazilian retailers.
