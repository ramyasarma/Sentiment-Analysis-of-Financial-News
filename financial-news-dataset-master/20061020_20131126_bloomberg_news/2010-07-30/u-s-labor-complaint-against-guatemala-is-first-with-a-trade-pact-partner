             The U.S. will file a complaint
against Guatemala over its lack of labor protections using
provisions in a regional free-trade agreement, U.S. Trade
Representative  Ron Kirk  said.  
 It’s the first time the U.S. is invoking a trade accord to
challenge another country’s labor practices, and follows a rise
in violence against union organizers in the Central American
nation, Kirk said today in a speech in Pennsylvania.  
 “With this case, we are sending a strong message that our
trading partners must protect their own workers, that the Obama
administration will not tolerate labor violations that place
U.S. workers at a disadvantage,” Kirk said.  
 Guatemala was part of the U.S.-Central American Free Trade
Agreement approved by Congress in 2005. U.S. trade with
Guatemala was $7 billion last year, up from $6 billion in 2005,
before the agreement was implemented, according to Commerce
Department data.
