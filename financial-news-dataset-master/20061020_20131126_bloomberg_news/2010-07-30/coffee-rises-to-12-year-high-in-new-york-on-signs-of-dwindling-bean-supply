             Coffee prices jumped to a 12-year
high as inventories dwindled for the 20th straight month. Cocoa
also gained.  
 Inventories of arabica coffee in warehouses monitored by
ICE Futures U.S. have dropped every month since November 2008,
falling 54 percent. Based on price-chart analysis, futures may
extend the rally to the highest level since August 1997, said
Jim Stellakis, an independent analyst, and Robin Rosenberg, a
futures and options strategist at PFG Best.  
 “We’re really just running down existing stocks” said
 Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery rose 3.25
cents, or 1.9 percent, to close at $1.763 a pound at 2 p.m. on
ICE in New York. Earlier, the price reached $1.7875, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Feb. 6, 1998. The
commodity jumped 6.2 percent this week.  
 In 2010, coffee has gained 30 percent, the most among 19
raw materials in the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  
 Coffee futures may jump as much as 13 percent to $2,
Stellakis and Rosenberg said. That would mark the highest level
since Aug. 11, 1997.  
 On the Liffe exchange in London, robusta-coffee futures for
September delivery gained $63, or 3.6 percent, to close at
$1,810 a metric ton at 5:30 p.m. local time.  
 Stockpiles of robusta, grown mostly in Vietnam, were
211,930 tons as of July 26, down 39 percent from the end of
2009, according to figures from NYSE Liffe in London.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery climbed $45, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $3,091 a ton at 12:02 p.m. in New York.
The price climbed 4.2 percent this week and 5 percent in June.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery fell 13 pounds, or 0.6
percent, to settle at 2,273 pounds ($3,567) a ton at 4:50 p.m.
in London.
