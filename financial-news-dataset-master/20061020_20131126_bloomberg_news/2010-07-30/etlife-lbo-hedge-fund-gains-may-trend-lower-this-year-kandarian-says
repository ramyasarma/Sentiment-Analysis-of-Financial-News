             MetLife Inc. , the  biggest  U.S. life
insurer, said results from investments such as buyout and hedge
funds may not match those in the second-quarter when so-called
variable holdings returned $296 million.  
 “We expect variable investment income to trend lower for
the remainder of the year,” Chief Investment Officer  Steve Kandarian  said today in a conference call.  
 MetLife swung to a $1.56 billion profit in the three months
ended June 30 on the improved investment results and a gain in
sales. Life insurers, which invest premiums before paying
claims, often put a portion of their assets in private-equity
and hedge funds with the expectation that returns beat bond
yields.  
 The leveraged-buyout market, where funds acquire companies
using mostly debt financing, hasn’t fully recovered from a
collapse in 2007 when underwriters got stuck with $200 billion
of loans. Private-equity firms announced about $35 billion of
buyouts for the first half of this year, compared with $6.9
billion in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 MetLife posted a $767 million net investment gain, compared
with a $2.6 billion loss in the same period a year earlier. The
net loss in second quarter of 2009 was $1.4 billion.  
 The insurer gained $1.86, or 4.6 percent, to $42.06 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading. The company
has climbed about 19 percent this year.
