             Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., the
U.S. iron-ore producer which has made four takeover bids this
year, said it’s still looking for opportunities to make
additional acquisitions.  
 “It needs to fit the criteria of our strategy, the
minerals that we’re comfortable with, that we believe have good
supply and demand dynamics,” Chief Financial Officer  Laurie Brlas  said in an interview in New York today. “There could be a
bolt-on, it certainly could be transformational, but those are
less common.”  
 The Cleveland-based company’s deals in 2010 have a combined
value of more than $1 billion, Brlas said. They include a $757
million bid for coal miner INR Energy LLC and a $80.8 million
offer for Spider Resources Inc.  
 Cliffs will look for deals in a similar price range, she
said. The company intends to expand in locations where it
already operates, which include North America, Latin America and
Australia, Brlas said.  
 “Our strategy is growth and diversification,” she said.
“The organic growth opportunities are limited just because
you’re mining the rocks that are in the ground, and in many of
our locations there’s just not many.”  
 Second-quarter net income rose to $260.7 million, or $1.92
a share, from $45.5 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, Cliffs
said July 28.
