             England national soccer team
goalkeeper  David James  signed a one-year contract with Bristol
City of the second-division Championship.  
 James, 39, left Portsmouth on a free transfer following the
club’s relegation from the Premier League last season. His deal
with City contains an option for a further season, the club said
on its  website .  
 James has made 53 appearances for England, including 3 at
this year’s World Cup in South Africa. He’s also played at
Liverpool, Aston Villa, West Ham and Manchester City during his
career.  
 Bristol City also signed defender  Nicky Hunt , who spent the
past 10 years at Bolton, to a two-year contract and added
defender Damion Stewart from Queens Park Rangers on a three-year
deal.  
 Bristol City opens the Champions season Aug. 7 at home
against promoted Millwall.
