             The rate that London-based banks say
they can borrow at for three months in dollars fell the most
in almost 11 months.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
dropped to 0.454 percent today from 0.466 percent, according to
the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the biggest decline
since Sept. 1, 2009.  
 The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, narrowed to 26.18 basis points as of 11:26 a.m. in
London, from 27.16 basis points yesterday.
