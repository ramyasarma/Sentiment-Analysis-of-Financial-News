             Tea production in Kenya, the world’s
biggest grower of black tea, rose 61 percent in the year to May
after wet weather this year ended an almost two-year drought.  
 Output of the leaf increased to 183,197 metric tons in the
five months to May compared with 113,946 tons a year earlier,
the Nairobi-based Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said on
its website yesterday. The average price of tea per kilogram
(2.2 pounds) was 198.56 shillings ($2.48) in May compared with
194.33 shillings the same month a year earlier, according to the
report.  
 Kenya’s coffee sales in the six months ending June fell 40
percent to 23,062 metric tons compared with the same period a
year earlier, the bureau said, without giving a reason. Earnings
from horticultural exports dropped 25.2 percent to 19.5 billion
shillings in the half year to June, it said.  
 The decline in Kenya’s horticultural sales followed the
cancellation of Europe-bound flights for six days in April, when
an Icelandic volcano closed European airspace, as well as the
European debt crisis, Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank
Ltd. said in an e-mailed note to clients today. European nations
buy 82 percent of the flowers, vegetables and fruits produced by
Kenya, Sterling said in the note.  
 Horticulture is Kenya’s biggest foreign-exchange earner,
followed by tea and tourism.
