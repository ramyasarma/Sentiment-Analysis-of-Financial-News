             The euro at $1.30 against the dollar
is “not a bad rate,” Cyprus Finance Minister  Charilaos Stavrakis  said.  
 “We feel that we have become more competitive” compared
with previous higher levels of the 16-nation currency, Stavrakis
said today in a telephone interview with Bloomberg Television.
While the euro has gained 6.3 percent in the past month to trade
at $1.3014 today, it remains almost 19 percent below the three-
year high of $1.5991 reached in April 2008.  
 “I think $1.30 is not a bad rate from the point of view of
export competitiveness,” Stavrakis said from his office at the
Finance Ministry in Nicosia. “Anything significantly higher
could perhaps hinder the efforts of the big exporting countries
to further boost their exports.”  
 A weaker currency makes  exports  from the euro area more
attractive to purchasers abroad. Exports from Germany, Europe’s
biggest economy, jumped more than twice as much as economists
forecast in May, data showed on July 8.  
 With the European currency still down 7.4 percent against
the dollar from a year ago, rising export orders probably helped
the region’s economy gather momentum in the second quarter. A
0.2 percent expansion in  gross domestic product  in the first
three months of the year was led by a 2.1 percent increase in
exports.
