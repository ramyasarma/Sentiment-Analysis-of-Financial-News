             Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
to export terminals near New Orleans fell relative to Chicago
futures after prices jumped to a six-month high, eroding demand
for immediate supplies. Corn premiums were unchanged.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
August dropped to 74 cents to 75 cents a bushel above August
futures on the Chicago Board of Trade from 75 cents to 76 cents
yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. Corn
premiums for delivery next month were unchanged at 32 cents to
37 cents above September futures, which reached a two-week high.  
 “There’s not much interest in adding to inventories” with
harvesting already beginning in the southern U.S.,  said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines, Iowa.  
 Soybean futures for August delivery rose 25.75 cents, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $10.525 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the CBOT.  
 Corn futures for September delivery rose 13.5 cents, or 3.6
percent, to settle at $3.9275 a bushel.
