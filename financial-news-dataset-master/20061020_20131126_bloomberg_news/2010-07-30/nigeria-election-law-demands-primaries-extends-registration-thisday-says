             Nigeria’s  parliament  passed a new
electoral law that requires candidates to emerge from party
primaries rather than through undemocratic processes and allows
more time for voter registration,  ThisDay  reported.  
 The Senate and the House of Representatives yesterday
approved a harmonized version of the legislation, which will be
sent to President  Goodluck Jonathan  for his endorsement, the
Lagos-based newspaper said. The law bans the selection of
candidates by so-called affirmation, ThisDay reported. The
process involves a nominee’s selection through the consensus of
party leaders and then endorsement by members.  
 Under the law, the  Independent National Electoral
Commission  must have voter registration completed 60 days before
elections instead of the previous 120 days, the newspaper
reported. That means the rolls must be ready by November of this
year for the 2011 vote, it said. Nigeria’s elections may take
place in January.  
 Foreign and local observers said the 2003 general elections
in Africa’s most populous nation and top oil producer were
flawed because of widespread rigging, violence and under-age
voting.
