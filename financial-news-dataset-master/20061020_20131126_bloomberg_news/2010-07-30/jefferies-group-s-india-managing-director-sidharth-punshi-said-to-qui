             Sidharth Punshi , a managing director
at the Indian investment banking unit of Jefferies Group Inc.,
quit today, according to two people with knowledge of the matter
who declined to be identified before a public announcement.  
 Punshi, 36, was hired in May 2008 as country head for
Indian operations, according to a statement from Jeffries at
that time. He joined from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was
an executive director and head of the European information-
technology services and software sector in the investment
banking group, following a tenure at Citigroup Inc.  
 Tom Tarrant , a spokesman for the New York-based brokerage
and investment bank, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail
seeking comment.  
 Jefferies, which opened its New Delhi office in 2007,
yesterday said it hired  Michael Alexander  as chief executive
officer of its Asia unit. The company also said it hired seven
other executives, including Credit Suisse Group AG’s  Nilesh Jasani  as managing director and head of Asia-Pacific research.
