             Redecard SA , Brazil’s second-largest
card-payment processor by market value, said profit rose 9.1
percent in the second quarter as credit- and debit-card spending
grew in Latin America’s largest economy.  
 Net income  rose to 374.6 million reais ($213 million), or
56 centavos per share, from 343.3 million reais, or 51 centavos,
a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. The  mean estimate  for net income excluding
some items was 358.9 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  
 Brazil’s gross domestic product will grow 7.2 percent this
year, according to a central bank survey published July 26.
Retail sales rose 10.2 percent in May from a year ago as
consumers bought more electrical appliances, furniture and food
products, according to the national statistics agency. Redecard
said the combined value of credit- and debit-card transactions
increased 19.8 percent in the quarter to 41.8 billion reais.  
 The company benefited from “the strong growth in credit-
and debit-card transaction value in the second quarter,”  Daniel Malheiros , an analyst at Spinelli Corretora SA in Sao Paulo,
wrote in a July 27 report.  
 Cielo, the country’s biggest credit-card processor by
market value, ended its exclusive right to handle Visa-branded
transactions this month. That may lead to higher costs and
increased competition for Redecard,  Jorg Friedemann , an analyst
at Bank of America Corp. in Sao Paulo, wrote in a July 14
report.  
 “As Redecard prepares to face tougher competition,”
Friedemann wrote, “we anticipate higher operating expenses and
costs per transaction to offset still strong, but decelerating,
credit and debit volumes.”  
 Redecard’s net sales rose 16.6 percent to 862.9 million
reais, while the company’s recurring net sales, which exclude
some items, were 658.4 million reais.  
 Redecard rose 0.4 percent, or 11 centavos, to 26.12 reais
in Sao Paulo trading at 9:43 a.m. New York time.
