             Nomura Holdings Inc., one of the 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve, said policy
makers will “ease” at their Aug. 10 meeting, though what form
this takes is debatable.  
 Central bankers may change the language of their statement
to signal that the Fed’s balance sheet will remain expanded and
change policy on the mortgage program to start reinvesting
paydowns, the firm said in a note to clients today. There is
also a chance of other actions, such as a cut in the rate on
excess reserves, the note said.
