             The Connecticut home of  Faisal Shahzad , who pleaded guilty last month to trying to detonate a
car bomb in New York’s Times Square in May, will be sold in a
public foreclosure auction.  
 Shahzad’s former home in Shelton, a city of about 38,000
people about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Manhattan,
will be auctioned off tomorrow starting at noon, according to a
Connecticut state court  filing .  
 The Pakistani native bought the 1,356-square-foot, three-
bedroom Colonial in 2004 for $273,000, and added his wife’s name
to the deed in 2007, according to the Shelton  assessor’s office .
The home is assessed at about $243,000,  according  to property
website Trulia.com.  
 Shahzad left Connecticut in June 2009 for Pakistan, and his
wife and two children followed him, he told a U.S. district
judge while pleading guilty last month. Chase Home Finance sued
him and his wife for foreclosure in September, and the court on
May 28 ordered the house sold at auction, court records show.  
 Shahzad told the judge he returned to the U.S. in February
and rented a home in Bridgeport, about nine miles southwest of
Shelton, where he made the bomb that he drove into Times Square
on May 1.  
 The vehicle, containing an improvised bomb, was found
smoking on the street. Shahzad was arrested at New York’s John
F. Kennedy International Airport on May 3 after boarding a
flight to Dubai and pleaded to 10 terrorism-related charges. He
faces a mandatory life term at his sentencing Oct. 5.  
 The criminal case is U.S. v. Shahzad, 10-00928, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
