             Millicom International Cellular SA 
has received expressions of interest from two possible bidders
for its Laos unit after a deal to sell to  VimpelCom Ltd. 
stalled, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation.  
 The possible buyers of the 74.1 percent holding in Millicom
Lao Co. Ltd. have offered terms similar to those from Russia’s
VimpelCom, according to the person, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private.  
 Millicom agreed last September to sell the unit to
VimpelCom for about $65 million, payable on completion of the
takeover. In March, Millicom said the sale hadn’t been completed
“despite all conditions precedent having been met,” and that
it would seek compensation for any loss of value.  
 Emily Hunt , a spokeswoman for Millicom, declined to
comment. Vimplecom declined to comment, except to say that talks
are ongoing.  
 “We are in the process of active dialogue with Millicom
and the Laos government and are very interested in closing the
deal of acquiring the asset,” said  Elena Prokhorova , a
spokeswoman for VimpelCom, Russia’s second-largest mobile-phone
company.  
 Luxembourg-based Millicom is divesting its Asian operations
to focus on Africa and Latin America, where its assets include
telecommunications providers in Bolivia and Tanzania. It
completed the sale of its Cambodian and Sri Lankan operations
last year.
