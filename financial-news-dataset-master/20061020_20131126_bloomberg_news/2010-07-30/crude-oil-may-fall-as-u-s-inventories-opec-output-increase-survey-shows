             Crude oil may fall next week amid
increases in U.S. oil supplies and OPEC production, a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  
 Fifteen of 36 analysts, or 42 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through Aug. 6. Twelve respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted that futures will rise, and nine, or 25 percent,
forecast prices would be little changed.  
 Crude oil inventories climbed 7.31 million barrels to 360.8
million last week, an Energy Department report showed. Imports
increased 12 percent to 11.2 million barrels a day, the highest
level since Aug. 25, 2006. Imports in states along the Gulf of
Mexico jumped to a record 7.21 million.  
 “Rising inventories and rising OPEC production point to an
ongoing surplus and downward risk for prices,” said  Tim Evans ,
an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  
 Crude oil for September delivery fell 3 cents this week to
$78.36 a barrel, its smallest weekly move in actual-price terms
on the New York Mercantile Exchange since December 2003. Prices
were up 18 percent from a year ago and rose 4.4 percent in July.  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ oil
output increased for the third time in four months in July, led
by gains in Iraq, the one member not subject to a quota, a
Bloomberg News survey showed. OPEC production rose by 80,000
barrels, or 0.3 percent, to an averageHW8K7Z9WHGPG&peplid=3725416&pepllastname=Yee&peplfirstname=Kai_Pin&peplcompanyname=Bloomberg_News&peplcompanynumber=604972&pepltitle=No_Title_Info&interviewstatus=0&interviewdate=2010-07-02_08_28_35&interviewreporterpepl=0&intervieweditorpepl=6614401&interviewsource=News_Reporter_Software&srange=6454&erange=6465">Yee Kai Pin and  Christian Schmollinger  in
