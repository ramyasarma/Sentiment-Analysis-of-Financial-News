             Japan’s food rice stockpiles may
reach the highest level in eight years at the end of June 2011,
leading to a price drop and planting curbs by growers next year.  
 Private and government inventories are forecast to climb
2.5 percent to 3.24 million metric tons from 3.16 million tons a
year earlier, the  Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and
Fisheries said in a report today. It will be the largest volume
since 2003 as consumption is expected to drop by 51,000 tons to
8.05 million tons in the year to June 30.  
 Increasing supply may pressure Japanese rice prices, which
declined 6.4 percent on average in the past year. It may also
force local growers to cut production further next year, after
reducing output by 4 percent to a six-year low in 2009.  
 “The current level of private stockpiles is already very
excessive,” said Shigeo Fuji, senior executive director at
 Central Union of Agricultural Co-Operatives , Japan’s biggest
farmers organization. Out of 3.16 million tons in the June 30
stockpiles, 980,000 tons were held by the government and the
rest was kept by farmers and distributors.  
 “Rice growers may have to cut production by 600,000 to
700,000 tons next year,” Fuji said at the ministry’s advisory
panel meeting, which approved the forecast today. Japan’s food
rice production is planned at 8.13 million tons this year,
compared with last year’s 8.15 million.  
 Shrinking Demand  
 The Japanese government increased subsidies to reduce food
rice sowing to balance supply with declining consumption. Demand
is expected to keep shrinking as the nation’s population ages
and declines, Masachika Murai, director at the ministry’s rice
policy planning division, said at the meeting in Tokyo today.  
 Wholesale prices of Japanese rice harvested last year
averaged 235 yen per kilogram in June, declining from 251 yen a
year earlier, according to the ministry.  
 The government started subsidy payments this fiscal year to
support incomes of local rice growers. It also increased
payments to farmers who switch rice paddy production to crops
for alternative uses, such as animal feed.  
 Japan, the world’s largest corn importer, is self-
sufficient in rice as the government protects growers from
foreign competition with a 778 percent tariff on imports.  
 The country agreed to give minimum market access to rice-
exporting countries at the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in
1993, buying 770,000 tons a year.  
 Japan imported a total of 10.12 million tons of rice from
April 1995 to March 2010. Of this, 3.52 million tons was sold to
domestic food processors, 2.53 million tons was used as aid to
foreign countries, 1.8 million tons was sold to Japanese feed
makers and 1.08 million tons was used as table rice, the
ministry’s report showed today.  
 Stockpiles of foreign rice stood at 970,000 tons as of
March 31, compared with 1.11 million tons a year earlier,
according to the report.
