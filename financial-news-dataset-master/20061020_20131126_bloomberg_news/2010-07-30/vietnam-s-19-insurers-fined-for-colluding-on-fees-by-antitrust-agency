             Vietnam Competition Council  fined 19
insurance companies including  Bao Viet Holdings , the country’s
biggest listed insurer, for colluding to increase insurance fees
for motor vehicles, according to a statement on the Ministry of
Trade and Industry website.  
 The companies accounted for 99.79 percent of the country’s
market share in motor vehicle insurance in 2008 when 15 insurers
signed a motor vehicle insurance agreement that four joined
later that year,  Vietnam Competition Authority , a ministry
agency said in the statement.  
 “The companies violated competition law when they signed
the agreement,” according to the statement. The companies’
actions have had a negative impact on the country’s motor
vehicle insurance market, Dinh Trung Tung, a representative from
the competition council, said in the statement.  
 Each company has to pay 0.025 percent of 2007 total revenue
in fines and 100 million dong ($5,237) in settlement fees,
according to the statement. The insurers have to pay more than 2
billion dong in fines, Dau Tu newspaper reported without saying
where it got the information.  
 The insurers, which include  PetroVietnam Insurance Joint-
Stock Co. ,  Agriculture Bank Insurance Joint-Stock Co. and   Bao
Minh Insurance Corp. , can submit complaints about the fines
within 30 days, the statement said.
