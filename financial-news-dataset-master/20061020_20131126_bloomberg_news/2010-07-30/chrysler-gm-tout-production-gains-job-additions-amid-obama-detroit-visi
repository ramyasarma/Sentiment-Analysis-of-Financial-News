             Chrysler Group LLC and General
Motors Co. announced plans to boost production and add jobs as
U.S. President  Barack Obama  visited the Detroit area today to
promote the government’s bailout of the auto industry.  
 Chrysler said its plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan,
which had been scheduled to shut in 2012, will remain open and
that a second shift will be added in 2011. GM said it plans to
build 45,000 of the Chevrolet Volt electric car at its Hamtramck
plant in Detroit in 2012, 50 percent more than previous targets.  
 Obama and the automakers are trying to show that the
government’s $84 billion investment in the industry -- most of
which went to GM and Chrysler -- is paying off as the companies
show progress and bring back lost jobs.  
 The additional work at Chrysler’s Sterling Heights plant 
will create about 900 jobs and spur suppliers to add about
500 workers, the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company said in a
statement.  
 Chrysler Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said the
automaker “probably” will add a third shift at its Jefferson
North Assembly Plant in Detroit, which makes the Jeep Grand
Cherokee and Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles. Production of
the Durango will begin in the fourth quarter and the third shift
will depend on how well the vehicle sells, Marchionne told
reporters after Obama’s visit to the plant.  
 Jefferson Plant  
 The Jefferson plant employs 2,800 people,  Jodi Tinson , a
Chrysler spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. That’s up from 1,452 at
the end of 2009. The plant assembled 49,600 vehicles last year,
down from 72,900 in 2008.  
 Chrysler owes the U.S. Treasury $5.8 billion, according to
the automaker’s first-quarter financial results. The U.S.
government owns 9.9 percent of the automaker.  
 GM, which is 61 percent owned by the government, is
preparing for an initial public offering that may sell 20
percent of the Treasury’s stake and reduce the U.S. to a
minority owner, people familiar with the plan said in June.  
 The company said earlier this week that the Volt will sell
for $41,000 and come with a monthly lease rate of $350 a month.
The Volt can travel 340 miles on a tank of fuel, with the first
40 in electric drive before a gasoline engine starts to recharge
the battery.
