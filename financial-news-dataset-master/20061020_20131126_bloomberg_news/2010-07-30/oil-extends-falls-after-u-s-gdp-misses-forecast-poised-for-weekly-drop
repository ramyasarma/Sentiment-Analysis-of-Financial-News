             Oil extended losses in New York,
tracking equity markets, after a report showed the U.S. economy
grew less than forecast in the second quarter.  
 Gross domestic product expanded 2.4 percent, less than the
2.6 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Crude oil, poised
for its biggest weekly decline in four, may decline further next
week as U.S. inventories rise, according to a separate survey.  
 “This drop should provide traders with a good level to get
into long positions,” said  Alexander Ridgers , head of
commodities at London-based CMC Markets. “We are already near
the lower end of the range for the week.”  
 Crude oil for September delivery fell as much as $1.18, or
1.5 percent, to $77.18 a barrel in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange and was at $77.32 at 1:43 p.m.
London time. It is down 2.3 percent this week.  
 Brent crude for September settlement dropped as much as
$1.09 to $76.50 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
and was at $76.63 a barrel.  
 The U.S. is the world’s biggest consumer of oil.
