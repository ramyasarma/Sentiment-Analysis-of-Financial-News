             Russia declared emergencies in 27
crop-producing regions, four more than a week earlier, because
of the worst drought in at least a decade.  
 Drought ruined plantings across at least 10.3 million
hectares (25.5 million acres), compared with a figure of 10
million hectares a week earlier, a spokeswoman for the ministry,
who declined to be named because of official policy, said by
phone today.
