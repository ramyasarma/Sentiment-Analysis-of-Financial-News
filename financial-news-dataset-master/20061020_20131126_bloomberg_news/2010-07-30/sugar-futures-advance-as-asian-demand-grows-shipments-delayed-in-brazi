             Sugar rose in New York, capping the
biggest weekly gain since mid-June, as Asian demand increased
while shipments from Brazil, the world’s largest exporter, were
delayed by rain.  
 The Philippines will likely award rights to import 100,000
metric tons of sugar as early as today, Sugar Regulatory
Administration planning head Rosemarie Gumera said. A record 115
vessels were waiting to load at Brazil’s six main ports as of
July 27. The backlog is more than twice as big as last year.  
 “Sugar is in a bull market because of tightness in the
near-term supply,” said  Phil Streible , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.07 cent, or 0.4
percent, to close at 19.57 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Yesterday, the price reached 19.67
cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since March
15.  
 Raw sugar jumped 7.2 percent this week, the biggest weekly
advance since June 11, and surged 22 percent in July.  
 Prices may reach 21 cents a pound in the next 30 to 60
days, Streible said.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, refined-sugar futures for
October delivery climbed $8.40, or 1.5 percent, to settle at
$585.70 a metric ton at 5:30 p.m. local time. Earlier, the price
reached $586.30, the highest level since March 9.  
 “Strong physical demand in the whites market has kept the
futures buoyant,” Czarnikow Group Ltd. said today in a report.
The October contract “has continued to show strength,” the
London-based trading company said.
