             Coinstar Inc. , owner of the Redbox
movie-rental kiosks, fell the most in almost two months in
Nasdaq trading after delayed access to some new DVD releases
caused second-quarter revenue to miss analysts’ estimates.  
 Sales  rose 35 percent to $342.4 million, the Bellevue,
Washington-based company said yesterday. That was less than the
$381.3 million average of seven analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 DVD sales rose less than anticipated because of agreements
with three studios that delayed Redbox’s access to some new
releases until 28 days after they go on sale in stores. Some
investors may be reluctant to accept the company’s new forecast
because of the second-quarter miss, said  Michael Pachter , an
analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.  
 “Blame the stock-price decline on management being less
transparent then they needed to be,” said Pachter, who has an
“outperform” rating on the shares and doesn’t own any. “It’s
a lack of confidence we’re seeing today.”  
 The studio agreements created a gap of about three weeks in
the supply of new releases in Redbox machines, the company said
yesterday. Coinstar spokeswoman  Marci Maule  said the company
doesn’t comment on daily share-price fluctuations.  
 Coinstar tumbled $2.59, or 5.4 percent, to $45.50 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. That was the
 shares ’ biggest daily percentage drop since June 7. They have
gained 64 percent this year.
