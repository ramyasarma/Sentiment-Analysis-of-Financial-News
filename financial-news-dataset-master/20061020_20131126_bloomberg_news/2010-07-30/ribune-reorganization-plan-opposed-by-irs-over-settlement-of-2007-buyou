             U.S. tax officials oppose  Tribune
Co. ’s reorganization plan, arguing it would stop them from
collecting potential taxes related to the bankrupt newspaper
publisher’s 2007 buyout.  
 The U.S. Labor Department is investigating the tax
implications of the $8.3 billion buyout, the Internal Revenue
Service said in an objection filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Should that probe determine
Tribune owes taxes related to the buyout, the IRS would be
barred from collecting them because of the legal releases
contained in the plan, U.S. government attorneys wrote.  
 Creditors are split over the reorganization plan, with some
arguing it shouldn’t settle allegations about the legality of
the buyout and others in favor.  
 Bankruptcy examiner  Kenneth N. Klee  found evidence of a
fraudulent transfer involving the second part of the two-part
deal that real-estate billionaire  Sam Zell  used to take over the
newspaper and television company. Klee found that creditors are
“somewhat likely” to win a lawsuit based on the smaller
portion of the $8.3 billion transaction.  
 Tribune filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, a year after
the Zell-led  buyout . Creditors have said in court papers that
Klee’s report may influence the way they vote on Tribune’s
reorganization plan. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge  Kevin J. Carey 
in Wilmington, Delaware must take those votes into consideration
when he decides whether to approve the reorganization plan and
allow the company to exit bankruptcy.  
 The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
