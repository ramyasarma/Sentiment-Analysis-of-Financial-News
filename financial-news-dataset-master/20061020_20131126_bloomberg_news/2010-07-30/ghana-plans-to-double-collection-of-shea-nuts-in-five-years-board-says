             Ghana  wants to double the collection
of shea nuts, which are used to make butter for cosmetics and
food, in the next five years to 100,000 metric tons, the Ghana
Cocoa Board said.  
 The state-run board, which oversees Ghana’s cocoa-growing
industry as well as coffee and shea-nut production, needs $1.5
million to “train and provide equipment for the women who are
engaged in collection of the nut,” said William Quaittoo, the
board’s manager for coffee and shea.  
 Another $1 million is needed to help expand companies that
buy the nuts from farmers, he said in an interview in the
capital, Accra, yesterday. The board has asked the Ministry of
Finance to give the funding, he said.  
 The nuts, found in the fruit of the shea tree, are
collected in Ghana’s northern regions, where Accra-based  Produce
Buying Co. Ltd.  is building a plant to process shea butter,
Quaittoo said.  
 Shea trees are found across Central and West Africa in the
dry Sahel lands, according to the  West Africa Trade Hub , a U.S.
Agency for International Development-funded project that works
with African exporters to find markets for their products. The
nuts are usually collected by women, according to the project’s
website.
