-- Economic Growth in U.S. May Show Consumer Spending Cooled

             The U.S. economy probably grew in
the second quarter at about the same pace as in the prior three
months, driven by a pickup in business investment as consumer
spending cooled, economists said ahead of a report today.  
 The 2.6 percent gain in gross domestic product from April
through June would follow a 2.7 percent first-quarter increase,
according to the median estimate of 81 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Household purchases  climbed 2.4 percent after
expanding 3 percent, the survey showed.  
 The pace of growth means employers may be reticent to boost
payrolls and are more likely to keep a lid on prices to sustain
sales. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week said
the central bank is prepared to take further policy actions if
the world’s largest economy “doesn’t continue to improve.”  
 “This is a half-speed recovery,” said  Robert Dye , a
senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in
Pittsburgh. “Business investment is coming back in typical
recovery fashion. Consumers are certainly not leading.”  
 The Commerce Department’s GDP report is due at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington. Survey estimates ranged from gains of 1 percent to 4
percent. Today’s GDP report also will include annual revisions
going back to 2007.  
 A dearth of jobs, a loss of household wealth resulting from
the slumps in stocks and housing, tight credit and the need to
reduce debt and rebuild savings are reasons economists forecast
spending will be slow to recover.  
 Lack of Jobs  
 Company payrolls rose by 83,000 in June, less than the
median forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg, figures
from the Labor Department showed July 2. The economy lost
125,000 jobs overall, reflecting a reduction of census workers
as the decennial population count started winding down. The
 unemployment rate  fell to 9.5 percent as discouraged workers
dropped out of the labor force.  
 A widening trade deficit also depressed growth last
quarter, economists said. The gap  adjusted  for inflation, the
figures used in calculating GDP, averaged $45.1 billion a month
in April and May, up from $42.3 billion a month in the first
quarter as imports climbed faster than exports, according to
figures from the Commerce Department.  
 Business investment is one area showing continued strength.
Shipments of non-military capital equipment excluding aircraft
climbed at a 16 percent annual pace in the three months ended
June after growing 12 percent in the first quarter, figures from
the Commerce Department this week showed. Orders for such goods,
a proxy for future corporate spending, grew at a 25 percent pace
following a 15 percent first-quarter increase.  
 Manufacturing Shares  
 Manufacturers are benefiting as companies here and abroad
update equipment and add to inventories. The Standard & Poor’s
Supercomposite  Machinery  Index, which includes companies such as
 Caterpillar Inc.  and Deere & Co., is up 13.5 percent so far this
year. The broader S&P 500  Index  is down 1.2 percent.  
 Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, last week raised its full-year earnings forecast on
higher demand in developing countries for mining, energy and
rail equipment.  
 “You’ve got strong growth in India and China that provides
demand for commodities,” Chief Financial Officer  Ed Rapp  said
in an interview July 22. “Most of the mining is happening in
the developing parts of the world.”  
 One industry likely to weigh on GDP in the coming months is
housing. Home sales have plunged after a government tax credit
expired on April 30.  
 The labor and housing markets are causing Americans to be
more pessimistic about the economy. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of  consumer sentiment , due
at 9:55 a.m. New York time, dropped to 67 this month from 76 in
June, according to the survey median.  
 The GDP estimate is the first of three for the quarter,
with the other releases scheduled in August and September when
more information becomes available. The government will estimate
June figures for trade and inventories, which will not be
available until next month.
