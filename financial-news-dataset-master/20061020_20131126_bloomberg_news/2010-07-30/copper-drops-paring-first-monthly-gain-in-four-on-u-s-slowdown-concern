             Copper dropped, paring the first
monthly gain since March, as expectations of a slowdown in U.S.
economic growth weakened the outlook for metals demand.  
 Copper for delivery in three months declined as much as 0.7
percent to $7,182 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,200 at 12:08 p.m. in Shanghai. The metal has gained
about 11 percent this month as equity markets rallied and the
dollar dropped amid optimism that the economic recovery remains
intact.  
 A report today may show the U.S. economy grew at an annual
rate of 2.6 percent in the second quarter, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists. That follows a 2.7 percent
increase in the first quarter. Asian stocks fell for the first
time in six sessions today as Japan’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly rose to a seven-month high in June.  
 “People have become cautious ahead of the key U.S.
economic data,” said Cao Yanghui, an analyst at Nanhua Futures
Co. from Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. “The gains in U.S. stocks
this month boosted overall market sentiment, and metals
benefited from that.”  
 Copper for October delivery in Shanghai declined 0.4
percent to 56,020 yuan ($8,270) a ton by the 11:30 a.m. local
time break. Aluminum in London dropped 0.3 percent to $2,086 a
ton, nickel was little changed at $20,700 a ton, zinc fell 1.3
percent to $1,965, and tin was yet to trade.  
 China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group and  Taiyuan Iron & Steel
Group  have agreed to jointly invest in a nickel mine in Myanmar,
according to a statement on the website of the steelmaker.
Taiyuan, the world’s biggest stainless steelmaker according to
the company, needs more than 100,000 tons of nickel a year, the
statement said.
