             The U.S. and Czech governments are
discussing plans to establish an early-warning center in the
Czech Republic as part of NATO’s anti-missile defenses, Prime
Minister  Petr Necas  said.  
 The Czech part of the system should have a “technical and
administrative character” and wouldn’t be a military base,
Necas said in a briefing broadcast by state-run Czech
Television.  
 U.S. President  Barack Obama  in September scrapped Bush
administration plans for a radar station in the Czech Republic
in favor of a more flexible approach to defending the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization against long-range missiles from
states including Iran.
