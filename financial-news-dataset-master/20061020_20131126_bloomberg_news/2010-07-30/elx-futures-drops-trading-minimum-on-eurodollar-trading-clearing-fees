             ELX Futures LP , the derivatives
exchange competing with  CME Group Inc.  for fixed-income futures
business, will charge all its users 18 cents for Eurodollar
trading and clearing fees beginning Aug. 1.  
 The New York-based exchange will eliminate minimum daily
trading requirements to be eligible for the lower fee, the
company said today in an e-mailed statement. ELX previously
charged 35 cents per contract to traders who bought or sold less
than 1,200 contracts a day.  
 Eurodollar futures, which track interest rates on U.S.
dollars held overseas, are the most widely-used financial
futures contract. ELX’s founding partners, including JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Getco LLC, created the exchange as a price alternative to CME
Group. ELX traded 3,176 three-month Eurodollar futures
yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  
 At Chicago-based CME Group, the world’s largest futures
market, 1.9 million three-month Eurodollar contracts changed
hands yesterday.
