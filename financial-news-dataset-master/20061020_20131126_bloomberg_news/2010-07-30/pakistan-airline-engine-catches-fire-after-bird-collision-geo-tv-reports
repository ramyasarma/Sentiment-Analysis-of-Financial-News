             An explosion took place in the
engine of a Pakistan International Airlines plane at Karachi
airport after a bird collided with it, GEO television reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 Flight PK-302 was on the runway taking off from Karachi and
headed to Lahore when the accident occurred, the broadcaster
said. The aircraft was a Boeing-747, it said.  
 Fire brigades reached the aircraft and passengers were
safely evacuated from the plane, GEO reported. Sultan Hasan, the
spokesman for the airline, didn’t immediately answer calls to
his mobile phone.
