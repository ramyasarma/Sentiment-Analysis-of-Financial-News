             Japanese  stocks  fell after
industrial production dropped unexpectedly and consumer prices
declined more than estimated, raising concerns the nation’s
economic recovery will stall.  
 Kobe Steel Ltd. , Japan’s fourth-largest steel mill, tumbled
7.2 percent after the nation’s factory output declined 1.5
percent in June. Asahi Glass Co., which makes glass for
construction and automobiles, dropped 2.7 percent. Mitsubishi
Estate Co., Japan’s second-biggest developer by sales, led real-
estate companies lower as its profit slumped on declining home
sales.  Nippon Express Co.  plummeted 9.7 percent after the
freight company slashed its profit outlook because of higher
transport costs and writedowns. Stocks also fell as the
unemployment rate increased unexpectedly.  
 “Industrial production figures showed the economy is
weaker than it looked in spring,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. “Companies are feeling the economy
is slowing down and recovery momentum is weakening.”  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 1.6 percent to
9,537.30 at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, the most among Asian
equity indexes. The broader  Topix  index lost 1.4 percent to
849.50, with almost seven stocks declining for each that rose.
All 33 industry groups in the Topix retreated.  
 For the week, the Nikkei and the Topix are up 1.1 percent
and 1 percent respectively, their second straight weekly gains.  
 Peak Earnings Reports  
 The Topix has lost 6.4 percent in 2010, compared with a 1.2
percent drop by the  S&P 500  and a 0.9 percent gain by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
16.4 times estimated  earnings , compared with 13.3 times for the
S&P and 11.9 times for the Stoxx.  
 Today is the peak for April-June  earnings reports  in Japan,
with 322 companies announcing results out of the 1,671 companies
in the Topix index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Kobe Steel slumped 7.2 percent to 181 yen, the third-
largest drop in the Nikkei 225. JFE Holdings Inc., Japan’s
second-largest steelmaker, lost 3 percent to 2,675 yen. Asahi
Glass retreated 2.7 percent to 880 yen. Nippon Electric Glass Co.
dropped 3.3 percent to 1,101 yen.  
 Japan’s industrial production unexpectedly decreased 1.5
percent in June from a month earlier, the Trade Ministry said
today in Tokyo. The median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a 0.2 percent increase.  
 Deflation Persists  
 Japan’s statistics bureau said  consumer prices  excluding
fresh food fell 1 percent in June from a year earlier, after a
1.2 percent decline in May.  
 “The biggest reason for deflation is a lack of investment
opportunities for businesses,” said  Hisakazu Amano , who helps
oversee about $18 billion in Tokyo at T&D Asset Management Co.
“The situation won’t improve anytime soon regardless of what
measures the central bank or government take,” as deflation
drags down economic growth.  
 Real-estate companies fell the  most  among the Topix index’s
33 industry groups led by Japan’s two biggest developers
Mitsubishi Estate and  Mitsui Fudosan Co.  which reported profit
declines.  
 Mitsubishi Estate  said net income for the three months
ended June 30 fell 30 percent to 6.77 billion yen as home sales
fell. Mitsui Fudosan said first-quarter profit slid 72 percent
to 4.49 billion yen as vacancy rates rose, crimping earnings
from office leasing. Mitsubishi Estate plunged 4.1 percent to
1,218 yen while Mitsui Fudosan lost 3.9 percent to 1,280 yen.  
 Developers Plunge  
 “Real-estate companies’ earnings were weak, because of
poor rentals and condominium sales,” said  Kazuhiro Takahashi , a
general manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa Securities Capital Markets
Co. “Today’s jobs data showed employment is not likely to
increase and that is also dragging down the market.”  
 The nation’s  unemployment rate  increased to 5.3 percent in
June from 5.2 percent a month earlier, according to the
statistics bureau. That compares with the median estimate of 5.2
percent by 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Nippon Express plummeted 9.7 percent to 352 yen, the most
in the Nikkei. The freight company slashed full-year net income
forecast 32 percent to 17 billion yen, citing higher fuel costs
and writedowns. It kept its sales target at 1.6 trillion yen.  
 Yen Rises  
 Japan Tobacco Inc. sank 3.1 percent to 278,000 yen. The
cigarette maker said first-quarter  net income  fell 47 percent to
22.8 billion yen after domestic sales dropped and a stronger yen
reduced the value of overseas earnings.  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 86.25 against the dollar,
the strongest level since Dec. 1. Against the euro, Japan’s
currency strengthened to 112.63 from 113.53. The higher yen
reduces income at Japanese companies when overseas revenue is
converted into local currency.  
 “The yen has been strong and that’s creating an
unfavorable investment environment for Japanese stocks,” Daiwa
Asset’s Nagano said.  
 Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions, jumped 3.6
percent to 2,705 yen, the fourth- biggest gain  in the Nikkei. The
company raised its full-year earnings forecasts after sales of
TVs helped it post an unexpected profit last quarter. Sony
projected net income will rise to 60 billion yen from a loss of
40.8 billion yen a year ago.
