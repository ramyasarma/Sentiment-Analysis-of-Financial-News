             KV Pharmaceutical Co.  sued generic-
drug maker  Perrigo Co. , alleging patent infringement with plans
to make low-cost copies of the drug  Gynazole  used to treat
female yeast infections.  
 KV asks a federal judge in Delaware to rule that Perrigo’s
sale of its version of the medicinal cream would violate U.S.
patent laws, and to issue an injunction to stop Perrigo from
marketing the drug until the patent expires in 2017.  
 “Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed” without court
intervention, KV contends in court papers filed yesterday, which
also seek attorney fees.  
 KV reported a $313.6 million net loss on $312.3 million in
sales for the fiscal year ended in March 2009. The company said
in March it cut more than 200 jobs after manufacturing problems.
Company stock has fallen about 70 percent this year.  
 Perrigo, which also makes store-brand drugs, reported $2
billion in sales for the fiscal year ended in June 2009. Its
shares have risen about 40 percent this year.  
 Daniel Willard , a Perrigo spokesman, didn’t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  
 KV, based in Bridgeton, Missouri, fell 5 cents to $1.09 at
11:49 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Perrigo, of Allegan, Michigan, rose 63 cents to $55.88 in Nasdaq
stock market trading.  
 The case is KV Pharmaceutical Co. v. Perrigo Israel
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 10CV641, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  
 To see the patent: 5,993,856.
