             Pakistan reached 147-9 on the second
day of the opening cricket Test with England at Trent Bridge in
Nottingham as bad light halted play with the visitors trailing
by 207 runs.  
 James Anderson took five wickets and Steven Finn three
today as England pressured Pakistan, which needs 8 runs to avoid
the follow on. England, which won the toss, reached 354 in its
innings.  
 Umar Gul was unbeaten on 30 runs, while Mohammad Asif was
on 0 when play was stopped. Shoaib Malik reached 38 to lead the
visitors before being caught by Andrew Strauss on a ball from
Anderson.  
 This morning, Asif took four wickets as Pakistan took six
English wickets in less than an hour. He got Paul Collingwood on
82 runs, Eoin Morgan (130), Graeme Swann (2) and Anderson (0),
all leg before wicket, while Matt Prior was run out on 6 after
confusion with Swann.  
 England started the day on 331-4 after an unbeaten 213-run
stand by Morgan and Collingwood.
