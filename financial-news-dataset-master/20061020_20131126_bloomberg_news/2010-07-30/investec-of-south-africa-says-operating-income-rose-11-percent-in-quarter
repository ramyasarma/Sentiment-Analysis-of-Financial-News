             Investec Plc , the South African
private bank and wealth manager, said fiscal first-quarter net
income climbed 2 percent as weak equity markets at home and in
Australia countered a stronger U.K. performance.  
 Net operating income rose 11 percent in the three months
through June, from a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based bank
said in a statement today. Investec will provide further details
on its performance on Sept. 16.  
 “South African and Australian operations were affected by
weak equity markets and low levels of economic activity posting
results behind the prior year,” Investec said in the statement.
“The U.K. business performed well with particularly strong
results recorded by the asset management and capital markets
divisions.”  
 South Africa’s  fifth-largest bank by assets has traded in
London since 2002 and last month completed the purchase of the
53 percent of Rensburg Sheppards Plc it didn’t already own to
build its wealth business in the U.K. Increased savings levels
in the developed world should continue to “underpin growth” in
wealth and asset management, Investec said today.  
 Investec Plc’s capital adequacy ratio was 16.1 percent on
June 30, according to U.K. Financial Services Authority rules,
compared with 15.6 percent for Investec Ltd., using South
African Reserve Bank regulations.  
 Impairments remained at “elevated levels,” with a credit-
loss charge as a percentage of annualized average gross loans
and advances at 0.83 percent during the quarter, the bank said.
That was down from 1.16 percent three months earlier.
