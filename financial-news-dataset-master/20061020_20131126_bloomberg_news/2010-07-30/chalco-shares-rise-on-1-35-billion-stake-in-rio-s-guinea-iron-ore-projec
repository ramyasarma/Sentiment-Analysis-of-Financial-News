             Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest producer of the metal, rose the most in more
than four months in Shanghai trading after agreeing to buy a
stake in Rio Tinto Group’s Simandou iron ore project in Guinea.  
 Chalco, as the Beijing-based company is known, rose 6.7
percent to 10.89 yuan at the 3 p.m. close, the biggest gain
since March 19. In  Hong Kong trading , it rose 2.5 percent to
HK$6.88 at the 4 p.m. close.  
 Chalco, facing a 12 percent drop in aluminum prices, will
benefit from tapping what London-based Rio has said is the
world’s top undeveloped iron ore deposit. The Chinese company
yesterday agreed to pay $1.35 billion for a 44.65 percent stake
in the project, which UBS AG estimated to be worth $9.5 billion,
by funding development over the next two to three years.  
 “Chalco’s profit has dropped sharply and last year it had
a loss,” said  Wu Kan , a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong
Insurance Co. “The Simandou iron ore assets may give investors
a positive profit expectation, even though it will be some years
later.”  
 The deal will be Chalco’s biggest overseas investment after
it last month pulled a plan to develop an A$3 billion ($2.7
billion) bauxite project in Australia as market conditions
deteriorated. In February, Chalco agreed to jointly develop and
operate a $1 billion smelter in Malaysia with GIIG Holdings Sdn.  
 The company may have to sell equity to raise funds for the
Simandou venture, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note
yesterday. The project could raise long-term  profit  by 75
percent, analysts led by  Trina Chen  said.  
 Two Partners  
 Chalco will work with other Chinese companies, including
China Railway Construction Corp. and China Communications
Construction Group, on the project, it said in a statement at
yesterday’s signing ceremony.  
 Rio fell 1.2 percent to A$70.61 at the 4:10 p.m. close on
the Australian stock exchange.  
 Rio will retain a 50.35 percent stake after the investment
by Chalco, and a 5 percent stake is held by the International
Finance Corp. The Guinean government has an option to buy as
much as 20 percent, and has “recently expressed a willingness
to exercise that option,” yesterday’s statement said.  
 Guinea doesn’t recognize the agreement between Rio and
Chalco, Mahmoud Thiam, the country’s mines minister, said
yesterday in Conakry, the capital. While approval isn’t a
condition for the venture, Rio continues to consult with the
government, Rio said yesterday. Chalco spokeswoman Shen Hui
declined to comment.  
 Rio controlled the entire Simandou concession until Guinea
ordered it to hand over blocks 1 and 2 in December 2008 to
closely held BSG Resources Ltd. In April this year, Brazil’s
Vale SA agreed to pay $2.5 billion for deposits in Guinea,
including those blocks. Last month, Guinea told Rio it planned
to take a 20 percent stake in blocks 3 and 4 at the project.
