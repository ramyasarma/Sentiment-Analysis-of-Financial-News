             Kenya Airways Ltd. , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest carrier, rose the most more than two
weeks after saying cargo and passenger volumes in the three
months through June advanced.  
 The stock climbed 2.25 shillings, or 4.9 percent, to 48
shillings as of 10:49 a.m. in Nairobi, the biggest intraday gain
since July 14.  
 Cargo volumes increased 14 percent to 12,762 metric tons in
the quarter to June, while passenger traffic to Europe rose 16
percent, the Nairobi-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Passenger traffic to Africa and the Middle East climbed
13 percent, while volumes within Kenya fell 6 percent.  
 “The total passenger tally, which closed on 666,658,
increased by 4 percent,” the company said. “The growth
underpins increased long-haul customer travel made possible by a
better economic environment,” it said. “The resulting average
cabin factor improved from last year’s level of 61.6 percent to
67.2 percent.” Cabin factor is the number of passengers to
passenger capacity for a particular airplane.  
 Growth of cargo tonnage is an indication of “the improved
business atmosphere,” it said.
