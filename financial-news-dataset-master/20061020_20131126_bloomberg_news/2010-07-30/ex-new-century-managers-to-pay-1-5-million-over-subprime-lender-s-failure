             Three former  New Century Financial
Corp.  executives agreed to pay more than $1.5 million to settle
U.S. regulatory claims that they failed to disclose risk in the
firm’s subprime-mortgage business before it collapsed in 2007.  
 Brad Morrice , the company’s former chief executive officer,
will return $464,354 in ill-gotten profits plus $76,991 in
interest and pay a $250,000 fine, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said today in a statement posted on its website.
 Patti Dodge , the ex-finance chief, will pay $550,000, and  David Kenneally , the former controller, will pay $182,500.  
 The SEC accused the executives in December of failing to
 disclose  increases in early mortgage defaults, loan buybacks and
pending repurchase agreements. New Century was the No. 2
subprime lender when it filed for bankruptcy in April 2007, a
failure that foretold the credit market freeze that led to the
worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  
 Morrice, a co-founder of Irvine, California-based New
Century, knew the market for home loans to borrowers with poor
credit histories was weakening and began a weekly summary he
entitled “Storm Watch” in September 2006, the SEC said in its
 complaint . He failed to share his assessments with New Century
investors, the regulator said.  
 Kenneally inflated New Century’s financial results in the
second and third quarters in 2006 by understating expenses
related to loan repurchases, the SEC said. The company reported
a $90 million profit in the third quarter of 2006 when it
actually had an $18 million loss, the agency said.  
 The former New Century executives agreed to settle without
admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, the agency said.  
 Josh Epstein , a spokesman for Morrice at law firm Proskauer
Rose in New York, didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking
comment. Dodge’s attorney,  Terry Bird , and Kenneally’s lawyer,
John Vandevelde, also didn’t immediately return phone calls.  
 SEC Investigation  
 The SEC has conducted a broad investigation of the
mortgage-market collapse, which led to more than $1.8 trillion
of writedowns and credit losses since the start of 2007.  
 The agency sued former Countrywide Financial Corp. CEO
 Angelo Mozilo  in June 2009, claiming he withheld information
about his firm’s deteriorating financial condition and traded on
nonpublic information in selling shares. Mozilo, who co-founded
what was once the U.S.’s biggest mortgage lender, has denied
wrongdoing. Countrywide was sold to Bank of America Corp. in
2008.
