             Repsol YPF SA, Spain’s largest oil
company, is seeking to raise about $4 billion from an initial
public offering of its Brazilian business, valuing the unit at
about $10 billion, two people familiar with the plan said.  
 Banco Santander SA, Bank of America Corp. and Itau Unibanco
Holding SA are among banks managing the transaction, said the
people, who declined to be named as terms of the deal aren’t yet
public. Repsol is most likely to sell about 40 percent of its
Brazil unit in the IPO, according to one of the people, who said
banks are still working on a formal valuation proposal.  
 Repsol  is seeking cash to fund  exploration  and production
in Brazil, where it has stakes in the Guara and Carioca fields
near Tupi, the largest discovery in the Americas since Mexico’s
Cantarell in 1976. The company is planning to conduct the IPO by
the end of the year and won’t wait for Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s
planned $25 billion share sale, Repsol Chief Operating Officer
Miguel Martinez said yesterday on a conference call.  
 Petrobras , as Brazil’s state-controlled oil company is
known, on June 22 delayed plans to sell shares to September from
July. Both Petrobras and Madrid-based Repsol are seeking to tap
investor interest in Brazil’s so-called pre-salt fields, which
lie deep beneath the ocean floor. Petrobras has said its Tupi
find may contain as many as 8 billion barrels of oil.  
 Kristian Rix, a Repsol spokesman in Madrid, and a Santander
official who can’t be named under company policy declined to
comment. London-based Bank of America spokeswoman Victoria
Garrod and Marcelo Motta of Banco Itau in Sao Paulo weren’t
immediately available to comment.  
 Santos Basin Investment  
 Repsol is investing in Brazil’s offshore Santos Basin and
elsewhere to increase output, while seeking to reduce exposure
to mature fields in Argentina. The company on April 29 said it
forecasts annual production growth of as much as 4 percent
through 2014 as projects in Brazil and Peru come online. The
company plans to invest 28.5 billion euros ($37.2 billion) in
that period.  
 Repsol dropped 19 cents, or 1 percent, to 18.10 euros in
Madrid. The stock has declined 3.3 percent this year, compared
with a 12 percent fall for Spain’s benchmark IBEX 35 index.  
 Argentine Sale  
 Repsol is still planning to sell a stake in its Argentine
unit  YPF , Martinez said on yesterday’s call. The company is
seeking to sell about 20 percent of YPF through a stock offering
in Buenos Aires and New York, Sebastian Eskenazi, the chief
executive officer of the business, said in a May 18 interview.  
 In 2008 Repsol delayed a public offering of a stake in YPF
aimed at raising cash for expansion in Libya, Brazil and the
Gulf of Mexico. Eskenazi, whose family bought 15 percent of YPF
for $2.2 billion in December 2007, expects to exercise an option
to boost the stake to 25 percent by 2012 this year, he said.
