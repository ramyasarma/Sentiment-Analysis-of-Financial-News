             Oman crude for September loading, a
Persian Gulf benchmark for Asia, fell for a third month as a
drop in refinery profits reduced demand for the grade.  
 Oman oil will sell for $72.50 a barrel in September, down
2.1 percent from August, according to Bloomberg calculations of
the average settlement price of futures traded on the Dubai
Mercantile Exchange this month.  
 Dubai crude, which is priced off the Oman benchmark, will
sell at $72.30 a barrel in September. Oil from the second-
largest sheikhdom in the United Arab Emirates is priced at a
differential to the Oman contract.  
 Refiner demand for Oman has declined amid a drop in
processing profits. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude was at
$12.19 a barrel today, down from $12.92 a month ago, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  
 Open interest in September Oman is at a record 15,847
contracts, or the equivalent of 15.8 million barrels of crude.
That means futures holders may take delivery of about 31 cargoes.  
 Oman  crude for immediate loading climbed 34 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $73.95 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.  Dubai 
for loading in September rose 36 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$72.86. Abu Dhabi’s  Murban  grade climbed 0.5 percent to $73.63.  
 Oman futures for October delivery slipped 73 cents to
$74.74 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:29 p.m.
Singapore time, with 30 contracts traded.  
 The  Brent-Dubai  exchange for swaps for September widened 10
cents to $1.78 a barrel and the exchange for swaps for October
widened 8 cents to $1.50 a barrel, according to data from
brokers PVM Oil Associates. The exchange for swaps is the price
difference between Brent and Dubai swaps contracts.
