             Anglo American Plc , owner of stakes
in the biggest platinum and diamond producers, may see the cost
of a Brazil iron-ore development, the company’s largest project,
surge by 20 percent because of delays in getting permits.  
 “This is somewhat of a moving target,” Chief Executive
Officer  Cynthia Carroll  told reporters on a conference call from
London today.  Anglo , which initially planned to begin mining in
2010, now says the earliest possible start date is in 2013.  
 Licensing and design changes at Minas Rio, one of four key
projects Anglo needs to boost output of commodities in demand in
expanding Asian economies, will add $210 million in  costs , while
another $180 million a quarter may be incurred from “schedule-
related costs,” the company said today in a statement. Anglo
said the costs will probably be incurred over nine months.  
 “While the delay was largely anticipated, the magnitude of
the capital increase will likely come as a surprise ” at more
than “$750 million,” UBS AG said in a note. The result is the
“key disappoint” in today’s interim earnings, it said.  
 Development charges at Minas Rio, which Anglo bought for
$5.5 billion near the top of a six-year commodity boom, may jump
to $4.55 billion, based on the increased costs.  
 Anglo American, which today resumed dividends it halted 18
months ago for the first time in more than 60 years,  fell  as
much as 1.9 percent and was down 0.1 percent at 2,538.5 pence by
12:20 p.m. in London trade. It slid 1.6 percent in Johannesburg.  
 The mine operator said underlying earnings climbed to $1.84
a share from $0.91 a year earlier, beating the $1.79  median  of
seven analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Tougher Licenses  
 The company plans to produce 26.5 million metric tons at
Minas Rio, which Anglo says suffered from delays because tighter
regulations are making it harder to win government licenses. In
February, Anglo estimated the cost of the project at $3.8
billion, up from an earlier figure of $2.7 billion.  
 “The tone of progress at Minas Rio is not reassuring,”
Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note. “Key permits remain
outstanding and Anglo American lack certainty on when
construction can begin.” Sanford C. Bernstein analysts
yesterday forecast a cost overrun of less than $500 million.  
 “Ever since its purchase in 2008 Minas Rio has been a
problem,” Credit Suisse AG said in a note this week. “Timing
at the peak of the market in first half 2008 did not help.”  
 Carroll last year suspended dividends and cut more than
23,000 jobs after metal prices plunged in 2008. She is selling
zinc, steel and phosphate assets to focus on the iron ore and
copper that’s in demand in Asian economies.  
 Anglo agreed this year to sell its zinc mines for $1.34
billion, parts of its Tarmac construction materials unit for
$400 million and Australian coal assets for about $450 million.  
 “These assets sales could fetch up to $6-8 billion and
coupled with the potential $2-3 billion stake sale in Minas Rio
could raise up to $10 billion,” Credit Suisse said this week.  
 Underlying earnings is profit attributable to equity
shareholders and adjusted for the effect of special items, re-
measurements and related tax and minority interests.
