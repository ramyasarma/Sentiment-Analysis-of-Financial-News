             Copper prices rose, capping the
biggest monthly gain in a year, on signs U.S. manufacturing will
boost growth and metals consumption.  
 The Institute for Supply Mangement-Chicago Inc. said today
that its business barometer rose to 62.3 this month, from 59.1
in June. The median estimate of 53 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was 56. Copper prices jumped 12 percent in July
on bets that economies will improve in the U.S. and China, the
world’s biggest metal buyers.  
 “There is no disputing the fact that growth prospects,
particularly out of China, are now front and center in terms of
market attention,”  Edward Meir , an analyst at MF Global
Holdings Ltd. in Darien, Connecticut, said in a report.  
 Copper futures for September delivery rose 2.15 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $3.3115 a pound as of 1:24 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. This month’s gain was the first since March
and the biggest since July 2009.  
 Earlier, futures fluctuated between gains and losses as
traders weighed an improving global outlook against concerns
that the U.S. economy is slowing. The metal fell as much as 1.3
percent.  
 The U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 2.4 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said
today. The median of 81 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was
2.6 percent.  
 “We had a pretty lackluster GDP report,” which limited
price gains, said  Frank McGhee , the head metal dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.  
 Copper for delivery in three months rose 0.9 percent to
$7,296.50 a metric ton ($3.31 a pound) on the London Metal
Exchange.  
 Aluminum, nickel, zinc and lead prices also gained. Tin
dropped.
