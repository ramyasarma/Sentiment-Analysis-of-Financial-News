             Freescale Semiconductor Inc. , the
chipmaker acquired in a 2006 leveraged buyout, may file to sell
shares in an initial public offering by the end of this year,
according to two people briefed on the plan.  
 The chipmaker met with investment banks last week at its
headquarters in Austin, Texas, the people said. No underwriters
were chosen and a filing isn’t imminent, said the people, who
declined to be named because the company is closely held.  
 Freescale was taken private in a $17.6 billion transaction
in 2006 by  Blackstone Group LP , Carlyle Group, Permira Advisers
LLP and TPG. Blackstone President  Tony James  said this week
during a presentation to the Oregon Investment Council that the
company is “about to file to go public.”  
 Discussions about a possible IPO are “more active today
than they were a while back,” Freescale Chief Executive Officer
 Rich Beyer  said in a July 23 interview. The company needs a
“healthy” economy and a growing semiconductor market for a
share sale to succeed, he said.  
 Representatives of Freescale and the private-equity firms
declined to comment.  
 Reuters reported July 21 that Freescale had held talks with
investment banks about an IPO.  
 Freescale had an operating  loss  of $18 million in the
second quarter, compared with a loss of $345 million in the same
period a year earlier. Cash flow from operations jumped to $120
million from a deficit of $68 million a year earlier.  
 $7.6 Billion Debt  
 That’s not enough for the company to be able to make
progress in paying down portions of its $7.6 billion of debt
before it starts maturing in 2012, according to  Jason Pompeii ,
an analyst at Fitch Ratings in Chicago. A rally in the company’s
 bonds  over the last month, partly fueled by speculation that its
owners are considering selling shares to pay off debt, may be
optimistic, he said.  
 “They’ve made tremendous progress and now they are at a
point where their cost structure will drive meaningful gains in
profitability,” said Pompeii. “But it’s difficult to make the
case that this company could organically meet its debt schedule.
They will need to refinance a significant amount of debt.”
