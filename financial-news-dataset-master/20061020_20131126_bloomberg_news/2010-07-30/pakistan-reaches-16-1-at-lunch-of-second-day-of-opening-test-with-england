             Pakistan reached 16-1 at lunch of
the second day of the opening cricket Test against England after
bowling out the home side for 354 runs this morning.  
 Salman Butt was caught on 1 by Matt Prior off a ball from
James Anderson. Imran Farhat, on 9 runs, and Ashar Ali (6) are

Graeme Swann (2) and Anderson (0), all leg before wicket, while
Prior was run out on 6 after confusion with Swann.
