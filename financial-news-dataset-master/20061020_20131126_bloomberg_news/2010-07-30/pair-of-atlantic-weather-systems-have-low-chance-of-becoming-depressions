             Two weather systems over the
Atlantic and southeastern Caribbean have a “low chance” of
strengthening into depressions or tropical storms, the National
Hurricane Center said.  
 Clouds and thunderstorms stretching from the island of
Guadeloupe to northern Venezuela have a 10 percent chance of
becoming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said today on its  website . Tropical
cyclones are rotating systems that include depressions, tropical
storms and hurricanes.  
 The second system, a patch of “disturbed weather” further
east over the Atlantic, is about 700 miles (1,100 kilometers)
southwest of the Cape Verde Islands and has a 20 percent chance
of becoming a tropical cyclone, the center said.  
 Neither system is close to the Gulf of Mexico, where  BP Plc 
is trying to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The
Caribbean system covers islands including Grenada, St. Vincent,
St. Lucia, Barbados, Martinique and Dominica.
