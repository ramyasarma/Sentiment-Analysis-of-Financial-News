             Schneider Electric SA , the world’s
biggest maker of circuit breakers, raised its margin target for
2010 after first-half profit more than doubled, helped by a
rebound in sales and cost cuts.  
 Net income rose to 735 million euros ($961 million) from
346 million euros a year earlier, the company, based near Paris,
said today in a statement. That compares with an average
estimate of a 566-million euro profit in a Bloomberg survey of
nine analysts. Second-quarter sales rose 10 percent like-for-
like to 4.66 billion euros.  
 “Our businesses gained traction in the past months,”
Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Pascal Tricoire  said in the
statement. Second-half “organic sales progression” should be
“broadly in line” with that of the first half, when it was 6.4
percent.  
 The company, which was hurt last year by the construction
slump in Europe and the U.S., said it’s on track for its 2009-
2011  cost -cut plan. Schneider now aims to lift 2010 earnings
before interest, taxes and amortization before restructuring
costs and the impact of the purchase of Areva Distribution to
“around” 15.5 percent of sales, up from a previous target of
14 percent.  
 The company bought the power-grid distribution unit of
Areva SA in June as part of a plan to expand in faster-growing
regions and in business areas such as energy efficiency and
services to boost its profitability. The “cash impact” of the
purchase of Areva’s power-distribution business was 1 billion
euros, Schneider said.  
 The purchase will be consolidated from June, and is
expected to add about 1.1 billion euros in revenue this year,
and to deliver an Ebita margin of about 5 percent before
integration and separation costs of about 50 million euros this
year, Schneider said.  
 The integration of Areva Distribution is “well on track,”
Tricoire said.  
 Schneider shares added 3.1 percent to 89.11 euros as of
9:03 a.m. in Paris.
