             NTPC Ltd. , Asia’s second-largest
power producer by market value, seeks 14.5 million metric tons
of coal for the year ending March 2012 in its largest annual
import, a company official said.  
 “It will be the biggest ever,” Suhas Datta, additional
general manager overseeing the purchase, said by telephone from
New Delhi today.  
 NTPC is importing the fuel directly for the first time
rather than arranging for supplies through Indian state-owned
trading companies such as  MMTC Ltd.  and the State Trading Corp.
of India, Datta said.  
 Bidders have until Aug. 10 to submit expressions of
interest to supply the coal on either a free-on-board or cost-
and-freight basis, he said.  
 State-owned NTPC, which has 15 coal-based power stations,
plans to more than double installed capacity to 75,000 megawatts
by 2017, according to the company’s website.  
 Imports will help meet a shortfall of thermal coal for the
existing capacity as well as for projects under construction,
the company said. Shipments may rise to 24.8 million tons
annually by the year ending March 2016, according to the
purchase document.
