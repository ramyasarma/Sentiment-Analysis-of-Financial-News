             Enel SpA  jumped to the highest in
more than a month after Italy’s biggest utility said it will
beat its 2010 profit target, prompting some banks including
Natixis to raise their ratings on the stock.  
 Enel shares rose as much as 1.5 percent to 3.7875, the
 highest since  June 22 and gained 4 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
3.77 at 1:45 p.m. in Milan. The advance left Enel with a market
value of 35.5 billion euros ($46.2 billion).  
 Chief Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti  said late yesterday he
expects Enel to beat a target for 2010 earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization of 16 billion euros ($21
billion). “We will be closer to 17 billion euros,” Conti said
on a conference call with analysts.  
 “Given the optimism displayed by management, which raised
its 2010 guidance, we have raised our recommendation to
neutral,” Natixis analysts wrote in a note to clients today.
The investment bank increased its target price on Enel to 3.82
euros from 3.53 euros.  
 First-half net income fell to 2.43 billion euros from 3.52
billion euros a year earlier, beating the 2.1 billion-euro  mean
estimate of 11 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Excluding one-
time items, profit rose 11 percent, Enel said yesterday in a
stock-exchange statement.  
 Revenue rose to 34.8 billion euros as sales increased in
Latin America and Spain. Net financial debt rose to 53.89
billion euros from 50.87 at the end of 2009 mainly because of
the effects of euro depreciation versus dollar and Latin America
currencies.  
 The company reiterated it plans to cut debt this year to 45
billion euros, excluding foreign-exchanges effects, by selling
assets, including a stake in its Enel Green Power unit.
