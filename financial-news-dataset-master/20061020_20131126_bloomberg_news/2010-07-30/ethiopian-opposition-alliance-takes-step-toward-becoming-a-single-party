             A coalition of  Ethiopian 
opposition parties will take steps toward becoming a single
party by forming a front, said Negasso Gidada, co-deputy
chairman of the so-called Medrek alliance.  
 The change will result in the opposition group having
“one general assembly, one center, one leadership and one
long-term strategic policy paper that is binding for all
parties,” Negasso said in an interview today from the capital,
Addis Ababa. Negasso is also deputy chairman of the Unity for
Democracy and Justice and a former president of Ethiopia.  
 Members of the alliance will meet tomorrow to discuss the
changes, said Merera Gudina, a deputy chairman of Medrek.  
 “People want unity, people are opposed to fragmentation,”
Merera said. “It gives them hope to challenge the regime and
its lies.”  
 Ethiopian Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi ’s ruling Ethiopian
People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front and its allies won all
but two of the 547 seats in the Horn of Africa country’s
parliament in May elections. Medrek obtained one seat.  
 A European Union election observer mission said in a May
25 report the vote did “not meet certain international
commitments.”  
 A Medrek front would create a “strong challenging
organization” for local and city administrations elections
that take place in two years time, Negasso said. Medrek is in
“informal discussions” with some of Ethiopia’s 79 registered
parties about joining the front, he said, without providing
details.
