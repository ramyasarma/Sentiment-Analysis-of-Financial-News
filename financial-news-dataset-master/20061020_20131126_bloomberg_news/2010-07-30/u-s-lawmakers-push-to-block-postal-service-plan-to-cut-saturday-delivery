             Lawmakers moved yesterday to block
plans by the cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service to save billions
of dollars by eliminating mail delivery service on Saturdays.  
 A pair of congressional panels approved legislation
mandating the agency continue to offer six-day delivery amid
complaints reduced service would inconvenience the public and
result in layoffs. Lawmakers said the  Postal Service  has other
ways of filling its budget hole.  
 “There are several steps that can be taken before we
decide to go to five-day service,” said Senator  Dick Durbin  of
Illinois, the chamber’s deputy Democratic leader. “There’s a
question about whether they overpaid into their pension system
and we haven’t resolved that -- and that’s a big amount of
money. It’s billions.”  
 Postal Service spokesman Gerald Washington said in an e-
mailthat the five-day proposal “is an important part” of the
agency’s “action plan for the future,” and “we expect that the
plan will be given full consideration by the Congress at the
appropriate time.”  
 The agency has said it could lose $7 billion this year, as
the public moves more of its business online, and that
eliminating Saturday  delivery  -- its lowest volume day of the
week -- could say $3 billion annually. It has offered six-day
service since 1863.  
 The provisions were included in annual spending bills
approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee and the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services.
