             Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. , a unit of
Brazilian meat processor JBS SA, fell the most in more than two 
months in New York trading after operating income missed 
analysts’ estimates.  
 Operating income dropped 52 percent to $51.9 million in the
second quarter from a year earlier, the Pittsburg, Texas-based
company said in a statement today. That trailed the $63 million
estimate of BMO Capital Markets analyst Kenneth Zaslow and the
$116 million projection of B. Riley & Co. analyst Scott Bunton,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Pilgrim’s Pride  fell 53 cents, or 7.6 percent, to $6.43 at
10:08 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares earlier declined as much as 16 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since May 6. The stock fell 22 percent this year
before today.  
 JBS owns 64 percent of the common stock of Pilgrim’s Pride,
according to the unit’s  website .
