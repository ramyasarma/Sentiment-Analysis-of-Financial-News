             Per Mansson , managing director of
Nor Ocean Stockholm AB, comments on  supply and demand  for
supertankers hauling 2 million-barrel cargoes of Middle East
crude this year.  
 Rental income  after fuel costs from shipping Saudi Arabian
crude oil to Japan on the industry’s benchmark route fell 24
percent yesterday to $11,585 a day, according to the London-
based Baltic Exchange. Owners need $11,601 after fuel costs to
pay crew, insurance, repairs and other running costs, according
to Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd. That excludes finance
expenses.  
 “Fundamentally, the fleet is too big for today’s volume,
and that’s the big reason” charter rates are declining.  
 Ships that were previously storing oil at sea for traders
are once again seeking cargoes, worsening the slide in rental
rates, Mansson said.  
 “We’re down to break-even levels, and that can only
continue so long. Then the owners will stop trading.”  
 “Also, winter markets have a nice impact on rates, both
because of colder weather, but also worse weather that gives
delays.”
