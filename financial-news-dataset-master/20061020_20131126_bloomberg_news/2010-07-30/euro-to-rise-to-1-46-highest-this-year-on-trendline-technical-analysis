             The euro may rise to $1.46, the
highest since December, should it breach $1.31 in the near term,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. said, citing trading patterns.  
 The euro “completely bottomed out” at a four-year low on
June 7 after having factored in the results of Europe’s stress
tests of banks, said  Daisuke Uno , chief strategist in Tokyo at
the unit of Japan’s third-largest banking group. The near-term
focus for the euro is whether it passes $1.31, which is on a
descending trend line that connects the highs of $1.3818 on
March 17 and $1.3692 on April 12, Uno said.  
 “A clear break above that key level would light up a
buying signal, pushing the currency toward a V-shaped ascending
path,” Uno said.  
 The euro touched a 16-month high of $1.5144 on Nov. 25,
before sliding to $1.1877 on June 7, the weakest level since
March 2006, as the European debt crisis deepened. The common
currency traded at $1.3056 as of 10:01 a.m. in Tokyo.  
 Another near-term target is $1.3125, a 38.2 percent
retracement of a drop from the Nov. 25 high to the June 7 low,
based on the Fibonacci sequence, Uno said.  
 Uno set the medium-term target for the euro at $1.46 to
$1.47 based on an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. The
pattern is formed when a currency makes three consecutive
troughs on a chart, with the middle the deepest. The three
troughs are lows reached on May 19, June 7 and June 29.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on a formula developed by 13th
century mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, known as Fibonacci, who
discovered the sequence while studying the reproduction rate of
rabbits. Analysts use the indicator to determine levels where
buy and sell orders may be clustered.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
