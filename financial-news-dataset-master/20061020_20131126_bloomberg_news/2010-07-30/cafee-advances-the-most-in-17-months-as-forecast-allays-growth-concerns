             McAfee Inc. , the second-largest
maker of security software, rose the most in 21 months in New
York trading after the company’s forecast allayed investors’
concerns about slowing growth.  
 McAfee jumped $2.85, or 9.4 percent, to $33.10 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the biggest gain
since October 2008.  
 The company’s results contrasted with those of bigger rival
Symantec Corp., which dropped the most in a year yesterday, a
day after forecasting sales and profit that missed analysts’
estimates. McAfee is poised to take advantage of “modestly”
improving information-technology spending,  Daniel Ives , an
analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said today in a research note.  
 “We would characterize last night’s quarter and outlook as
’better than feared’ by many on the Street,” Ives said.
Management has created a dynamic “that should put the company
back on its path toward double-digit growth.”  
 Second-quarter  profit  excluding some items was 63 cents a
share, McAfee reported. That topped the 60-cent average of
analysts’  projections  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 This quarter, profit on that basis will be  62 cents to 66
cents  a share, McAfee said. Analysts predicted 65 cents. Sales
for the period will be $505 million to $520 million, the company
said.  
 McAfee’s business is “beginning to show signs of
stabilization and improvement heading into” the second half,
 Israel Hernandez , an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc., wrote
today in a note.
