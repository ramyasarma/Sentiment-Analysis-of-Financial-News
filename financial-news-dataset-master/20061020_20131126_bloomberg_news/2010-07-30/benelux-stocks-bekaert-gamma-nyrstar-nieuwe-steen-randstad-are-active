             The  Amsterdam Exchanges Index  fell
1.92, or 0.6 percent, to 330.21 as of 1:22 p.m. local time,
trimming its gain this month to 4.3 percent. Belgium’s  Bel20
Index  retreated 0.6 percent to 2,523.88. The gauge has risen 5.8
percent this month.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the
Benelux markets today. Symbols are in parentheses.  
 Dutch stocks:  
 Gamma Holding NV  (GAMMA NA) soared 5.9 percent to 23.72
euros, on course for a close at the highest level since
September 2008. The world’s second-biggest maker of conveyor
belts reported first-half net income of 1 million euros ($1.3
million), compared with a loss of 53.6 million euros a year
earlier.  
 Nieuwe Steen Investments NV  (NISTI NA) retreated 2.9
percent to 13.91 euros, the biggest drop this month. The Dutch
owner of shops and offices in the Netherlands and Switzerland
said “the fragile economic recovery” wasn’t yet reflected in
an increase of the occupancy of the office portfolio in the
second quarter. The company expects this situation to remain the
same for the rest of the year.  
 Randstad Holding NV  (RAND NA) dropped 2.9 percent to 34.25
euros, a third day of declines. The world’s second-biggest
staffing company was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Rabobank
Groep.  
 Belgian stocks:  
 Bekaert NV  (BEKB BB) soared 7 percent to 161 euros,
bringing the stock’s gain since the start of the year to 48
percent. The world’s biggest maker of steel cord used in tires
said first-half net income more than tripled to 181 million
euros, beating the 116.3 million-euro average of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The company will pay an interim dividend of 2 euros a share
and propose a three-for-one share split.  
 KBC Groep NV  (KBC BB) tumbled 3.7 percent to 34.13 euros.
Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research kept Belgium’s
biggest bank and insurer by market value on their “least
preferred list.”  
 “We believe that the operational risks related to the
downsizing of Merchant Banking may be underestimated by the
market,” the brokerage said in a note. “We also see risks
within KBC Ireland. In the longer term, we believe that high
deposit margins in Belgium are at risk.”  
 Nyrstar NV  (NYR BB) gained 2.9 percent to 8.96 euros,
paring two days of declines. The world’s largest zinc producer
was raised to “buy” from “hold” at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc.
