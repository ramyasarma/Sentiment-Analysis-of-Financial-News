             Mohammad Asif took four wickets this
morning as Pakistan bowled England out for 354 runs in the first
cricket Test at Trent Bridge in Nottingham.  
 Asif got Paul Collingwood on 82 runs, Eoin Morgan (130),
Graeme Swann (2) and James Anderson (0), all leg before wicket,
while Matt Prior was run out on 6 after confusion with Swann on
the second day of the match.  
 England started the day on 331-4 after an unbeaten 213-run
stand by Morgan and Collingwood. The home side won the toss and
elected to bat.
