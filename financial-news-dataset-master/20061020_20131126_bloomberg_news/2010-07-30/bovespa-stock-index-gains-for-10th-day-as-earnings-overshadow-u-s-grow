             Brazil’s Bovespa stock index climbed
for a 10th day, heading for its first monthly advance since
March, after companies reported a jump in profit, overshadowing
a slowdown in U.S. economic growth.  
 Retailer Lojas Renner SA led gains after saying second-
quarter profit rose 90 percent. Vale SA, the world’s largest
iron-ore producer, rose after reporting a fourfold increase in
net income.  
 The Bovespa rallied 0.6 percent to 67,331.85 at 10:41 a.m.
New York time. Fifty-one stocks advanced on the measure while 13
fell. The real was little changed at 1.7579 per dollar.
