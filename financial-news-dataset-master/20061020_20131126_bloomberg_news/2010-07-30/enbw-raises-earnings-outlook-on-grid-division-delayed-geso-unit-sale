             EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG
raised its 2010 earnings outlook after it transmitted more power
with higher fees and the company sold its GESO utility operator
later than planned.  
 Adjusted earnings before interest and tax is now expected
to increase by between 1 percent and 3 percent from the 2009
level, which compares with an earlier forecast of 1 percent
above or below last year’s figure, the German energy company
said today on its website.
