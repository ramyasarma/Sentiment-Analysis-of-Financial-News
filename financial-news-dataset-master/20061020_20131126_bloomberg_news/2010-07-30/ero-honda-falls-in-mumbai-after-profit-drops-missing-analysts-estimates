             Hero Honda Motors Ltd. fell as much
as 4.5 percent in Mumbai trading after its quarterly profit
unexpectedly fell for the first time in almost three years.  
 India’s biggest two-wheeler maker posted a net income of
4.92 billion rupees in the quarter ended in June, compared with
5 billion rupees a year earlier, it said in a statement
yesterday after trading hours. That was lower than the 5.8
billion-rupee average profit estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
26 analysts.   
 Hero Honda’s first-quarter profit declined as the company
paid more for raw materials like steel and incurred costs for
upgrading technology to meet India’s new emission norms, Chief
Financial Officer Ravi Sud said.
