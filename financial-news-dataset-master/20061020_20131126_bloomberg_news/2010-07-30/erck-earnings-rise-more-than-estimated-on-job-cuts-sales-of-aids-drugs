             Merck & Co. , the second-largest U.S.
drugmaker, reported quarterly profit that rose more than
analysts estimated as reduced costs helped overcome lower-than-
expected sales.  
 Earnings, excluding one-time items, were 86 cents a share,
beating the 83 cent  average  estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income fell 52 percent to $752.4 million from
acquisition-related costs, the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-
based company said today in a  statement .  
 Revenue more than doubled to $11.3 billion with the
addition of products from the acquisition last year of Schering-
Plough Corp. falling short of analyst estimates by $70 million.
Merck said it has cut 7,000 jobs since the $49.6 billion
purchase was completed in November -- almost half of the 15,000
positions that are planned for elimination to help trim $3.5
billion in annual costs by 2012.  
 “The biggest lever that companies like Merck have
available to them in order to improve earnings is cost-
cutting,” said  John Sullivan , a managing director of health
care research at Leerink Swann & Co. in an interview with
Bloomberg TV.  
 Merck fell 60 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $34.46 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It had gained 17
percent in the past 12 months before today.  
 Merck said 2010 earnings probably will be $3.29 to $3.39 a
share, excluding one-time items. The company previously forecast
earnings of $3.27 to $3.41.  
 Merck has been shifting focus to outside the U.S. and
Europe where there are less pricing pressures from governments
and health insurers. The company said it added 1,000 people to
its sales force in China over the past year, giving it 5,000
sales representatives there. Merck started construction on a
37,000-square-foot manufacturing plant this month in Hangzhou,
China that will start making products for the Chinese market in
two years.
