             Walt Disney Co.  agreed to sell
Miramax to investors including  Ronald Tutor  and private equity
firm Colony Capital LLC for more than $660 million, ending a
six-month search to find a buyer for the art-house moviemaker.  
 The sale to Filmyard Holding LLC, backed by partners
including construction executive Tutor and Colony, is expected
to be completed by the end of the year, Burbank, California-
based Disney said today in a statement. Disney, the world’s
largest media company, began winding down Miramax, founded by
brothers  Harvey  and  Bob Weinstein , last October.  
 “The sale fits into a much wider logic with studios
reviewing where they can save money by selling some parts of the
business or bringing down budgets for film and reviewing and
redoing actor deals,” said  David Hancock , head of the cinema
market at researcher Screen Digest in London.  
 Miramax, with rights to more than 700 titles including
Academy Award winners such as “Chicago” and “Shakespeare in
Love,” was one of several film assets on the block.  Liberty
Media Corp.  agreed to sell its Overture unit to Relativity Media
LLC last week. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. is seeking buyers after
falling behind on $3.7 billion of debt.  
 “Our current strategy for Walt Disney Studios is to focus
on the development of great motion pictures under the Disney,
Pixar and Marvel brands,” President and Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Iger  said in the statement.  
 Disney fell 11 cents to $33.60 at 12:24 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock had gained 4.5
percent this year before today.  
 The Buyers  
 Tutor, chairman and chief executive of Sylmar, California
based  Tutor Perini Corp. , began negotiations for Miramax after
Disney ended talks with Los Angeles investor  Ron Burkle  and the
Weinsteins, who were working on a $625 million offer, people
with knowledge of the situation said earlier this month.  
 “The new buyers can’t just mine Miramax’s existing catalog
so they must have some plans for future production,” Hancock
said. “With DVD sales declining and video-on-demand not
contributing as much as was hoped, the value of catalogs have
gone down.”  
 Miramax’s top-grossing film was 2002’s “Chicago,” taking
in about $171 million, followed by 2000’s “Scary Movie” with
$157 million and “Good Will Hunting” with $138 million,
according to figures from U.S. researcher Box Office Mojo.  
 The Weinsteins sold Miramax, named after their parents
Miriam and Max, to Disney in 1993. The two, who left in 2005,
control rights to some films and are acquainted with both Tutor
and Barrack, according to one of the people. Disney had been
seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax.
