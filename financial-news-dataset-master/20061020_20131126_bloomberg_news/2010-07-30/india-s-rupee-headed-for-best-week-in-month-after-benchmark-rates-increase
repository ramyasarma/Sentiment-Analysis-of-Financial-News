             India’s rupee completed its best
week in more than a month after the central bank raised
benchmark interest rates for a fourth time in 2010, boosting the
yield on local assets.  
 The currency touched this month’s high today on optimism
the government’s sale of shares in state-owned  Engineers India
Ltd.  drew capital from abroad. The  Reserve Bank of India  boosted
its overnight  borrowing rate  on July 27 by 0.5 percentage point,
more than the quarter-point increase forecast by economists, to
4.5 percent. Overseas funds have pumped $9.3 billion into Indian
equities so far this year, the most in Asia.  
 “The widening interest-rate differential with the dollar
is working in rupee’s favor,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general
manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Capital flows have
remained healthy, and the ongoing share sale also may help.”  
 The rupee appreciated 1.1 percent this week to 46.41 per
dollar as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It rose as high as 46.395 earlier, the
strongest level since June 29. The currency climbed 0.3 percent
from yesterday.  
 Offshore forward contracts indicated the rupee will trade
at 47.08 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations for a rate of 47.18 yesterday and 47.51 at the end
of last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  
 The yield on India’s 10-year debt is now about 7.8 percent,
the highest among the so-called BRIC nations that include Brazil,
Russia and China. Comparable fixed-income notes yield 2.95
percent in the U.S., 2.68 percent in Germany, 3.34 percent in
the U.K. and 1.05 percent in Japan.  
 Equity Inflows  
 The government seeks to raise as much as 9.6 billion rupees
($207 million) by selling its 10 percent stake in Engineers
India, which provides design and construction services, in an
offering that ends today. The company got bids for all the
shares on offer, data on the National Stock Exchange’s website
showed yesterday.  
 Funds based abroad raised  total holdings  of Indian stocks
to a record $82.1 billion on July 28, according to data released
by the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .
