             Imerys SA, a French mineral
processing company, said that its operating margin is likely to
exceed 12 percent this year as stimulus plans in the automotive,
construction and infrastructure industries stimulate demand.  
 First-half net income rose to 119.1 million euros from 11.7
million euros a year earlier, the company said in a statement on
its website.
