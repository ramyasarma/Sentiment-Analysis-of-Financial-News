             Nomura Holdings Inc. , Japan’s
biggest securities firm, offered jobs to 40 students at triple
the normal starting salary under a new plan to strengthen its
international business, two people involved in the hiring said.  
 The college recruits, chosen from 650 candidates, will take
up positions in  investment banking , trading and other
departments starting next April, the people said, speaking on
condition of anonymity because the information isn’t public.
They’ll be guaranteed a 6.5 million yen ($75,000) salary before
bonuses, compared with 2.4 million yen for regular hires.  
 Nomura is bidding to prevent top students from choosing
overseas firms such as  Morgan Stanley  and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. that often offer higher salaries. Investment-banking
candidates under the new program were required to score more
than 860 on  the Test of English for International Communication .  
 Keiko Sugai , a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Nomura, declined
to comment.  
 The special pay packages match those offered by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. to graduates in Japan before its
September 2008 bankruptcy. Nomura acquired Lehman’s Japanese and
European units later that year. At least 12 senior former Lehman
managers quit after Nomura paid out guaranteed bonuses in March.  
 Nomura plans to hire an additional 560 college graduates
for the next fiscal year under the traditional recruitment
system, paying them a salary of 2.4 million yen plus benefits
including overtime, the people said. Employees who get the so-
called “global banker” package won’t be compensated for
working late hours, according to the firm’s recruitment adverts.  
 University Students  
 Japanese companies offer jobs to university students as
early as a year before graduation. The academic year ends on
March 31 and new recruits start work on the following day.  
 Nomura said today profit fell 80 percent to 2.3 billion yen
in the first quarter on a slump in investment banking and
trading. The brokerage posted a pretax loss for its overseas
operations of 28.5 billion yen in the period, the biggest in
five quarters.  
 A first-quarter earnings estimate survey of four analysts
by Bloomberg News ranged from a profit of 2.2 billion yen to a
loss of 3.8 billion yen. The company earned 11.4 billion yen in
the year-earlier period.
