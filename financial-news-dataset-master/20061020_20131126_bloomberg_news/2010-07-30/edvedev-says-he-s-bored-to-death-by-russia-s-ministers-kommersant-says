             Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
told ministers he was “bored to death” by reports that boast
of accomplishments and avoid mentioning problems,  Kommersant 
said.  
 Medvedev complained that projects listed as achievements by
Regional Development Minister  Viktor Basargin  were started even
before he became president in 2008, the newspaper reported,
citing a Kremlin meeting yesterday on “priority national
projects.”  
 The president also criticized Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  for trying to start her report with positive news,
according to Kommersant. He quizzed Skrynnik on the need for the
Russian Agriculture Academy if it doesn’t focus on applied
sciences. “What do they study?” Kommersant quoted Medvedev as
saying. “Questions of life in the universe?”  
 Future meetings on national projects will be held in a
different format, with only two or three reports being given on
practical issues, Medvedev said, according to the newspaper.
