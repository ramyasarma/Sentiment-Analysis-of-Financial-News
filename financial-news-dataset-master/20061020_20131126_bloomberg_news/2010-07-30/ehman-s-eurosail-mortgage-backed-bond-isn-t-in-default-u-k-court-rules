             Investors in a mortgage-backed
security sold by  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  have lost their
application for the notes to be declared in default.  
 A court in London ruled against holders of bonds that were
part of the Eurosail-UK 2007-3BL PLC transaction. Lehman, which
filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2008, raised 650
million pounds ($1 billion) from the 2007 deal which packaged
U.K. home loans.  
 “Eurosail is not unable to pay its debts” under U.K.
bankruptcy law, according to a judgment handed down today.  
 The investors in A3 notes claimed that the securitization’s
assets are worth less than its liabilities, according to a Fitch
Ratings report on July 19. The ruling may affect other Lehman
Brothers transactions known as Eurosail-UK 2007-4 NP and
Eurosail-UK 2007-6 NC, Fitch said.
