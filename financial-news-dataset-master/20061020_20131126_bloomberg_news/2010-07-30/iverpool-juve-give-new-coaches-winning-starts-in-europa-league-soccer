             Liverpool and Juventus opened their
Europa League soccer qualifying campaigns with victories to give
new coaches winning starts in their first competitive games.  
 David Ngog  scored twice to give  Roy Hodgson ’s Liverpool a
2-0 win at Macedonia’s FK Rabotnicki last night. Amauri’s double
gave Juve the same result at Ireland’s Shamrock Rovers as Luigi
Delneri took charge of his first competitive game.  
 Liverpool and Juventus had to enter the third qualifying
round of Europe’s second-tier club tournament, which they have
won a record three times, after finishing seventh in their
respective domestic leagues last season.  
 Maritimo of Portugal had the biggest win last night with a
club-record 8-2 victory at home to Welsh team Bangor City.  
 The return matches are scheduled Aug. 3-5 with the 35
winners of the two-game series advancing to playoffs, where they
will be joined in the Aug. 6 draw by teams including FC Porto
and Manchester City.
