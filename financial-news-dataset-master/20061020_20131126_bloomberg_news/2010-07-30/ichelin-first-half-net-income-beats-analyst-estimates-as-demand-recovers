             Michelin & Cie ., the world’s second-
largest tiremaker, posted a first-half profit and gave a full-
year operating-margin target that were higher than analysts’
estimated because of less pressure from raw-materials costs.  
 Net income was 504 million euros ($658 million), compared
with a 122 million-euro loss a year earlier, the French company
said in a statement today. Analysts had expected profit of 369.4
million euros, based on the average of  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 17 percent to 8.35 billion euros.  
 “The recovery in the tire market should continue,”
Managing Partner  Jean-Dominique Senard  said at a news
conference, adding that Michelin plans to invest 1 billion euros
this year as it expands in Brazil, India and China. “We’re
pretty optimistic for the near future.”  
 Michelin’s earnings improvement follows a rebound by German
competitor Continental AG, which said yesterday it returned to
second-quarter profit as earnings from its tire division surged
60 percent. Italian rival Pirelli SpA yesterday raised its full-
year sales target even as it posted a first-half loss on the
cost of separating its real-estate division.  
 Michelin’s full-year margin goal of 9 percent was a
“positive surprise, versus street expectations which look for a
7.6 percent margin,” said  David Arnold , an London-based analyst
with Credit Suisse Group AG with an “underperform” rating on
the shares.  
 The company’s shares fell 0.9 percent to 58.82 euros at
11:02 a.m. in Paris, while the benchmark CAC Index dropped
0.5 percent.  
 Raw Materials  
 A lower “headwind” from rising raw-material costs offers
further encouragement, Arnold said in an e-mailed comment.
Michelin, based in the town of Clermont-Ferrand in central
France, said it expects commodity costs to reduce full-year
earnings by between 600 million euros and 650 million euros,
rather than the 750 million euros previously forecast.  
 The tiremaker has pledged to defend profitability by
passing the rising costs on to consumers through price hikes.
Natural rubber prices have risen by half in the past 12 months,
while crude oil, used to make its synthetic alternative, has
advanced 24 percent. Earnings in the remainder of the year will
“benefit from the price increases introduced in the first
half,” Michelin said today.  
 First-half operating profit before one-time items nearly
tripled to 822 million euros from 282 million euros a year
earlier. The company also reiterated its goal of achieving 10
percent growth in full-year sales volumes and positive free cash
flow.  
 Michelin ranks behind  Bridgestone Corp.  of Japan in global
tire production.
