             Central Huijin Investment Co.,  the
domestic arm of China’s sovereign wealth fund, plans to sell
bonds as soon as next month, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter.  
 China International Capital Corp. and Citic Securities Co.
will help the Beijing-based company sell bonds in batches of up
to 40 billion yuan ($5.9 billion), said the person, who asked
not to be identified as the details are private. The total size
of the sales hasn’t been decided, the person said.  
 Central Huijin plans to sell 80 billion yuan of bonds in
October with help from China International and Citic Securities,
the 21st Century Business Herald reported today, without saying
where it got the information. Money raised from bonds will be
injected into Export-Import Bank of China and China Export &
Credit Insurance Corp. to strengthen their capital, the China
Daily newspaper reported in June.
