             Mitsubishi Estate Co. , Japan’s
second-biggest developer, said first-quarter profit fell 30
percent on declining home sales.  
 Net income  dropped to 6.77 billion yen ($78 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 9.64 billion yen in the same
period a year ago, the company said in a statement distributed
through the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. Sales fell 9.8 percent
to 189 billion yen.  
 Japanese developers face record-high office vacancies in
Tokyo and a slump in the city’s housing market as companies cut
spending and the unemployment rate remains above 5 percent.
Mitsubishi Estate today said its residential business had an
operating loss of 1.65 billion yen in the first quarter compared
with a profit of 2.36 billion yen last year.  
 Revenue at the company’s housing business declined 31
percent in the first quarter, it said. Mitsubishi Estate sold
848 apartments in the quarter, 42 percent less than last year.  
 Condominiums put up for sale in the Tokyo region declined
for a fifth year in 2009 to 36,376 units, according to the  Real
Estate Economic Institute Co. , a Tokyo-based industry researcher.  
 Office Leasing Business  
 Operating profit, or sales minus operating costs, in the
company’s office leasing business fell 2.1 percent to 30 billion
yen in the quarter. The company’s vacancy rate rose to a five-
year high of 4.46 percent in June. Mitsubishi Estate owns more
than 30  buildings  in Tokyo’s central business district.  
 Tokyo’s office vacancy rate rose to 9.1 percent in June,
the highest since Miki Shoji Co., a privately held office
brokerage company, started compiling monthly data in January
2001.  
 The developer booked a one-time loss of 1.39 billion yen in
the quarter for exiting a project based in Saitama prefecture
near Tokyo, it said.  
 Mitsubishi Estate reiterated its full-year profit forecast
of 63 billion yen on sales of 975 billion yen.  
 Shares  of Mitsubishi Estate dropped 4.1 percent to 1,218
yen at the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
