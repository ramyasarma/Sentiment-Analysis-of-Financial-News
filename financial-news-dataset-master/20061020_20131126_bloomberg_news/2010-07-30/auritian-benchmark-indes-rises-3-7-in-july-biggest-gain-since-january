             Mauritius’s  benchmark stock measure 
had the biggest monthly gain since January as the euro
strengthened against the dollar and Mauritian rupee, boosting
the share prices of companies that earn revenue in the European
currency.  
 The 38-member  SEMDEX Index  surged 3.7 percent in July, the
second consecutive rise, when it rose 4.8 percent. The measure
closed 0.1 percent lower at 1,716.06 as of 1:30 p.m. in the
capital, Port Louis.  
 With the euro’s appreciation “investors turn to companies
having strong revenues in that currency, such as the tourism
sector and textiles,” Kishen Nadassen, an analyst with Cim
Stockbrokers, said in an interview from Port Louis today. “As
long as the euro strengthens versus the dollar and the rupee, it
will have a positive impact on the stock exchange.”  
 Harel Mallac Group , an engineering and electronics company
with operations in Madagascar, Seychelles and Comoros, surged 23
percent over the month. Today it closed unchanged at 215 rupees.  
 Air Mauritius Ltd. , which reports its earnings in euros,
gained for the first month in four, rising 6.3 percent.  Rogers &
Co. Ltd. , which has a 13.5 percent stake in Air Mauritius and
owns 17.6 percent of  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. , the country’s
biggest leisure group, rose 6 percent in the month to 267
rupees.  
 The euro strengthened 6.3 percent against the dollar this
month, reaching $1.3004 as of 2:27 p.m. in London, while against
the rupee, the euro gained to 39.2496 after reaching the weakest
level in a year of 38.9281 on July 9.  
 Sugar, Tourism  
 Europe accounted for 61 percent of Mauritius’s exports in
the first quarter of this year, while two thirds of visitors to
the island nation are from Europe, according to the Central
Statistics Office.  
 Mauritius, an island about 500 miles (805 kilometers) off
the east coast of Madagascar, earns most of its foreign currency
from tourism and exports of sugar, clothing and textiles.
