             The difference between the rates
banks pay for loans for three-months in dollars and euros
widened to the most in more than six months after the European
Central Bank ended part of its program to boost the economy.  
 The so-called  spread  between three-month dollar Libor and
three-month Euribor widened 9 basis points today to 44 basis
points, the most since Jan. 6. A 442 billion-euro ($575 billion)
12-month ECB loan to banks ended July 1.  
 “Euribors are pushing higher as the amount of excess
liquidity in the system has been reduced since the ECB’s 12-
month repo expired,” said  Peter Chatwell , an interest-rate
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “Dollar funding pressures are easing.”  
 Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers on
July 21 the outlook for the U.S. economy was “unusually
uncertain” and the central bank “remained prepared to take
further policy actions” to foster the recovery.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or  Libor , for three-
month loans in dollars dropped to 0.454 percent today, the
lowest since May 14, according to the British Bankers’
Association.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or  Euribor , for three-
month loans, fell to 0.896 percent, according to the European
Banking Federation. That’s the first decline since April 20. It
was at 0.899 yesterday, the highest level in a year.
