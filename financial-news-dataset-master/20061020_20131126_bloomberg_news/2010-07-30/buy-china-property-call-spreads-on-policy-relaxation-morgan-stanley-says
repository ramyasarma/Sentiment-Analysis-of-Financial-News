             Investors should buy so-called
short-dated call spread collars on China’s property stocks to
benefit from a potential easing in the government’s policy
tightening measures, according to Morgan Stanley.  
 The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index  has rallied 11
percent since reaching the year’s low on May 7 as slowing growth
boosted speculation that regulators will have more room to relax
property-market curbs and loan quotas to support the world’s
third-largest economy. Property stocks on the Shanghai measure
have gained 16 percent since July 1, the most among the five
industry groups.  
 “The policy cycle is turning in China, something which
historically has triggered major equity market moves,” said
Morgan Stanley analysts led by  Viktor Hjort  in a report dated
yesterday. “The challenge now is capturing major moves while
recognizing that the market is no longer in basement-value
territory.”  
 The analysts advised investors to buy an October $105 call
while selling a $120 call and $88 put on a Morgan Stanley
property basket. They also recommended buying longer duration
call spread collars in the nation’s banks to gain “upside”
from potential credit growth. A call spread cuts the price of
the trade while capping potential profit.
