             Banca Generali Spa said net profit
in the first half almost doubled to 43.7 million euros from 23.9
million euros a year earlier as a jump in commissions more than
offset a decline in lending income.  
 Net interest income fell to 22.4 million euros from 28.6
million in the same period last year, the company said in a
statement distributed by the Italian exchange. Commissions
jumped to 106.9 million euros from 87.9 million euros last year,
the bank said.
