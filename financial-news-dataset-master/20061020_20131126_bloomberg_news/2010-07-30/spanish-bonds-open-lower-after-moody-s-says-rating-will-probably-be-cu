             Spanish government bonds fell after
Moody’s Investors Service said the nation will probably lose its
top Aaa credit rating.  
 The yield on the 10-year bond rose two basis points to 4.27
percent as of 7:36 a.m. in London. The two-year note yield
advanced nine basis points to 2.08 percent.  
 “Spain is very highly rated and I can’t say where that
rating will end up, but it’s likely to go down a bit,” Steven A.
Hess, senior credit officer at Moody’s, said in an interview in
Sydney yesterday.
