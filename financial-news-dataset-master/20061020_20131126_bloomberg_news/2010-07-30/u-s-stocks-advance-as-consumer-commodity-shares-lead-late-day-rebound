             U.S. stocks rose, extending the
biggest monthly gain in a year for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, as better-than-estimated data on consumer confidence and
business activity tempered concern the economic rebound is
slowing.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4 percent to
1,105.93 at 3:25 p.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 1.2
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.83
points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,495.99 after losing as much as 120
points  in the first half hour of trading.
