             L’Oreal SA heiress  Liliane Bettencourt ’s financial adviser,  Patrice de Maistre , was
released today after being held by police for a second time for
questioning over possible tax evasion by France’s richest woman.  
 De Maistre had previously been detained by police on July
15, a spokeswoman for the Nanterre prosecutor’s office said in a
telephone interview. He was held for five hours, she said. The
prosecutor’s office gave no details about the questioning.  
 The adviser was also questioned about possible illegal
financing of  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s presidential campaign in 2007.
That investigation was started last month after Bettencourt’s
former butler released recordings in which de Maistre refers to
political gifts and overseas bank accounts.  
 Yesterday Labor Minister  Eric Woerth , the treasurer for
Sarkozy’s  Union for a Popular Movement  party during the
presidential race, was also questioned by a police unit
specializing in financial crime in connection with the probe.  
 Woerth “denied receiving any campaign financing except
that authorized by the law,” his lawyer Jean-Yves Le Borgne
told reporters yesterday in Paris.
