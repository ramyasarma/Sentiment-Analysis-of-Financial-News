             Pakistan’s death toll from flash
floods and torrential rains in the northwest has risen to 408,
provincial Information Minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain said.  
 “The final toll will be much higher than we are estimating
now,” Hussain said at a news conference in Peshawar today.
“Once the water recedes, then we will know the true impact.”
