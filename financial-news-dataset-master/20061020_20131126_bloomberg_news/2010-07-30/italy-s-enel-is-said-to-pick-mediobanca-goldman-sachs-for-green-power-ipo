             Enel SpA , Italy’s biggest utility,
plans to hire Mediobanca SpA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Credit Suisse Group AG to manage the initial public offering of
its Green Power unit, said two people familiar with the sale.  
 Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, UniCredit SpA, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and BNP
Paribas SA were chosen as joint bookrunners for the IPO, planned
for October, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. Barclays Plc was also picked to
manage the sale, one of the people said. The Rome-based utility
hasn’t yet signed contracts with the banks, said the people.  
 Enel is planning a 4 billion-euro ($5.2 billion) IPO of its
Green Power division, which manages wind, solar, biomass, hydro
and geothermal power producers in 17 countries, to help repay
debt. The company also is considering selling a stake in the
unit to long-term investors, together with or as an alternative
to the IPO, it said in a statement yesterday.  
 An Enel spokeswoman in Rome declined to comment.  
 It would be the biggest IPO in western Europe since
December 2007, when Iberdrola Renovables SA raised 4.1 billion
euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Enel Green Power’s first-half net income rose 13 percent to
253 million euros from 223 million euros a year earlier,
according to the company’s statement.
