             McDonald's Corp. (MCD) , the world's
largest restaurant company, increased its annual dividend by 33
percent as part of a plan to return as much as $17 billion to
shareholders through 2009.  
 The company will pay the $2-a-share annual dividend to
shareholders after boosting sales, profit and cash from
operations. The quarterly payout of 50 cents to investors who
owned the stock on Dec. 1 amounts to more than $550 million,  Oak
Brook , Illinois-based McDonald's said today in a statement.  
 McDonald's, led by Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner,
focused on new chicken sandwiches, breakfast foods and coffees
to boost revenue by 9.1 percent in 2007, the biggest increase
in three years. The fast-food chain said it returned $5.1
billion so far this year and $5.7 billion in 2007 to
shareholders through dividends and share  buybacks .  
 ``It shows management's confidence that the strong
performance will continue,''  Giri Cherukuri , who helps manage
$1.4 billion at Oakbrook Investments LLC. The Lisle, Illinois-
based firm owns 279,566 McDonald's shares.  
 The dividend increase was more than the 20 percent to 25
percent that Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass estimated in a
Sept. 9 note to clients. The dividend is payable Dec. 15.  
 Sale Boosts Cash  
 The restaurant company increased cash from operations by
17 percent to $1.26 billion in the second quarter from a year
earlier, according to a securities filing. The sale of
McDonald's stake in U.K-based sandwich chain Pret A Manger to
buyout firm Bridgeport Capital Ltd. generated proceeds of
$229.4 million in the second quarter, the filing showed.  
 Global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months
climbed 8.5 percent in August from a year earlier, helped by an
almost 12 percent gain in  Europe  and the dollar's decline
against other currencies, McDonald's said Sept. 9.  
 August same-store sales in the U.S. advanced 4.5 percent
after almost a third of domestic restaurants sold large sodas
and sweet iced tea for $1, part of the chain's emphasis on
discounts that's also drawing customers overseas.  
 McDonald's rose 84 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $62.27 at
4:02 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite  trading . The
shares have advanced 5.7 percent this year, the best performer
among the five members of the  Standard & Poor's  500 Restaurants
Index.  
 A year earlier, McDonald's increased the annual dividend
50 percent, after raising it by 49 percent and 22 percent the
previous two years.
