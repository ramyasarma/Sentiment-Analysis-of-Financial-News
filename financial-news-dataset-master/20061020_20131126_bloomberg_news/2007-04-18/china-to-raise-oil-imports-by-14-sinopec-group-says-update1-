             China , the world's largest energy
user after the U.S., may increase crude oil  imports  by as much
as 14 percent this year to meet surging domestic demand, said an
official with the nation's largest oil refiner.  
 The nation may import between 160 million metric tons and
165 million tons this year, Sun Yongsheng, deputy chief engineer
of Economic and Technology Research Institute of China
Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group, said in the
northern city of Dalian.  
 China is increasing oil-processing capacity by 25 percent
by 2010 to satisfy growing consumption of gasoline, diesel and
chemical raw materials. The country's reliance on oil imports
will rise to 60 percent by 2020 from 47 percent currently, when
the imports almost doubles, Hao Hongyi, head of strategy
research at China National Petroleum Corp., the nation's largest
oil company, said yesterday.  
 Gasoline imports will jump 49 percent to about 100,000 tons
next year, Sun said. Diesel imports will climb 43 percent to 1
million tons, jet fuel imports may rise as much as 10 percent to
6.2 million tons and diesel imports will probably gain 4 percent
to 29 million tons, he said.  
 Domestic demand for crude oil will rise as much as 8
percent to 350 million tons this year, Sun said. Gasoline
consumption may gain 9 percent to 57 million tons, diesel use
could increase 7.5 percent to 125 million tons, he said.  
 Jet-fuel use may gain 7 percent to 12.32 million tons and
fuel oil consumption could remain unchanged or fall compared
with a year earlier, Sun said.  
 Gasoline Demand  
 China's demand for gasoline may increase 24 percent to 65
million tons by 2010 and 82 million tons by 2015, Bai Xuesong, a
senior engineer with China International Chemical Consulting
Corp., said March 20.  China International Chemical Consulting  is
a state-owned petrochemical consulting company.  
 China may increase crude oil processing capacity to 355
million tons by 2010 from 285 million tons in 2005, the National
Development and Reform Commission said.  
 China's oil demand may rise 6.1 percent to 7.56 million
barrels a day this year, the  International Energy Agency , an
adviser to 26 oil-consuming nations, forecast last month.  
 Sinopec Group may process 7 percent more crude oil this
year, the company last month. It may refine 167 million tons of
crude into fuel, including 27.1 million tons of gasoline.  
 Annual oil-product demand in China may reach as high as 230
million tons by 2010, Hou Hui, an analyst from Sinopec Group's
economics and development research institute, said on Dec. 7.
Oil-product demand will increase 6 percent a year through 2010,
Hou said.
