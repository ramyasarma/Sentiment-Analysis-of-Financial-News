             Centro Properties Group , the
Australian owner of U.S. shopping malls owner, will avoid a fire
sale after the stock plunged 86 percent this week, Chief
Executive Officer Andrew Scott said.  
 ``We do not need to urgently dispose of assets in accordance
with arrangements we have with our bankers,'' Scott said today in
an interview in  Melbourne . The  stock  fell 41 percent today.  
 He needs to refinance A$3.9 billion ($3.4 billion) of debt
for the Australian company and the listed trust it manages by Feb.
15. Centro owns 700 U.S. shopping centers including the Roosevelt
Mall in Philadelphia and Clearwater Mall in  Florida  after Scott
led $9 billion of acquisitions in the last two years.  
 ``There's a question mark over whether Centro can survive,''
said  Paul Xiradis , who helps manage $11 billion at Ausbil Dexia
in Sydney. ``They bought second-rate properties in the U.S. in an
environment where property was valued higher than it is now.''  
 Centro extended its two-day slump on the Australian Stock
Exchange, falling as much as  69 percent  before closing at 80.5
Australian cents, with about a third of the stock traded. This
values the Melbourne-based company at A$680 million, compared
with A$4.8 billion before the  rout . Centro Retail Group tumbled
about 24 percent to 65 Australian cents, slashing the trust's
market value to A$1.5 billion from A$3.3 billion last week.  
 Centro is the worst performer on the 1,960-member  MSCI (MXWO)  World
Index this year. The company's German-traded shares fell about 40
percent to 60 euro cents at 12.08 p.m. in Berlin.  
 Lending Banks  
 Scott said the lenders to Centro are  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA) ,  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) ,  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS)  and BNP Paribas.  
 Bryan Fitzgerald, a spokesman for Commonwealth, and Felicity
Glennie-Holmes, spokeswoman for National  Australia , declined to
comment, citing company policy on client confidentiality.
Fitzgerald confirmed Commonwealth is a creditor to Centro.  
 Spokespeople for JPMorgan, ANZ, BNP Paribas and Royal Bank
of  Scotland  didn't immediately return voicemail messages.  
 Centro may sell stakes in the Centro Australia Wholesale
Fund, Centro America Fund and Centro Retail Trust, analysts at
Merrill Lynch & Co. said in a report yesterday.  
 In a separate note today, Merrill Lynch said the problems at
Centro, with more debt than its peers, were an ``aberration''
among Australia's property stocks.  
 Shane Oliver , who helps manage the equivalent of $113
billion at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said ``any talk of
the company going bust at this stage is premature'' because it
can sell assets or raise capital.  
 `Looking for Value'  
 ``Given the strong underlying Australian property market, you
could argue that it's a good opportunity for investors to start
looking for value in the listed property trusts sector,'' Oliver
said in an interview.  
 Scott, who has led Centro since 1997, has a combined  stake 
of more than 7 million shares in Centro and the trust.  
 Some A$1.2 billion of the debt he needs to renegotiate is
for Centro, with the remaining A$2.7 billion for the trust,
Centro Retail Group, according to  Standard & Poor's .  
 The company was  created  in 1985 as Jennings Properties Ltd.
before being renamed Centro in 1991, the same year its flagship
`The Glen' mall in Melbourne's eastern suburbs was opened.  
 It moved into the U.S. though a joint venture with Watt
Commercial Properties and acquired 14 malls in  California .  
 Vacancy Rates  
 The vacancy rate for U.S. neighborhood and community
shopping centers will rise to the highest since 1996 as the
slowing housing market and a drop in  consumer confidence  makes
retailers more hesitant to sign leases and completions of new
sites rise, according to  Reis Inc. , a New York-based real estate
research firm.  
 The vacancy rate will increase to 7.5 percent by the end of
the fourth quarter, Reis said.  
 The largest U.S. shopping center owners, led by  Simon
Property  Group, are cutting profit forecasts as the economy slows.  
 Indianapolis-based Simon Property said Dec. 7 it plans to
write off its $26 million equity investment in a planned
community in Phoenix while General Growth Properties Inc. may
take a $77 million charge for land whose value declined.  
 Commonwealth Bank is Centro's biggest  shareholder  with a
12.2 percent stake held through its Colonial First State funds
management business.  
 ``Any stock with exposure to unsecured short-term debt is
currently feeling the impact of the credit liquidity issues in
the market,'' said Amber Saggers, a spokeswoman for Sydney-based
Colonial. She said this is leading to cuts to earnings forecasts
that ``don't necessarily reflect on the underlying quality of the
assets.'' Saggers declined to comment further.  
 `Watchful and Alert'  
 Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said the nation's financial
system remains sound, though it would be affected by fallout from
tightening global credit markets.  
 ``I've been in discussions with the regulators since I
became treasurer some weeks ago, and I will continue to do
that,'' he told reporters in Canberra today. ``The government and
the regulators are watchful and alert.''  
 Swan wouldn't comment on individual companies.  
 Centro's refinancing troubles has increased the perceived
risk of owning the debt of other Australian property trusts,
credit-default swaps show.  
 The cost of default protection on $10 million of Lend Lease
Corp. bonds increased $10,000 to $120,000, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. Credit-default swaps on the debt of Westfield Trust,
operated by the world's largest shopping center owner, also
gained $10,000 to $110,000. There are no contracts on Centro's
debt.  
 Credit-default swaps protect bondholders by paying the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities should the
borrower default. They rise as perceptions of  credit quality 
deteriorate.
