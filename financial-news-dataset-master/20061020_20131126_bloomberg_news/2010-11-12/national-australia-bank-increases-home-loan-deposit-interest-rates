National Australia Bank Ltd. , the
country’s fourth-largest lender by market value, followed larger
rivals in raising mortgage rates more than the central bank
increased borrowing costs, defying government demands to desist.  The standard variable home-loan interest rate at Melbourne-
based National Australia Bank will climb to 7.67 percent from
7.24 percent on Nov. 15, it said in a statement. Increases in
the past 10 days at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. 
and Commonwealth Bank of Australia also surpassed the quarter-
percentage point move by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Nov. 2.  Interest-rate gains that outpace those of the central bank
have triggered a backlash against Australia’s largest lenders,
and Treasurer  Wayne Swan  has said such increases can’t be
justified. The banks, even after reporting bigger profits, argue
that they are absorbing higher costs because the global
financial crisis made it more expensive to raise funds to lend.  “NAB has been absorbing these extra costs but it is not
sustainable for us to keep doing that forever,” the bank said
in today’s statement. “NAB will continue to absorb a
significant portion of its increased average funding costs.”  National Australia Bank also said it will scrap fees as of
Dec. 6 for customers who exit home loans early.  To contact the reporter for this story:
