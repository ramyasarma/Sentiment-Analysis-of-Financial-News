Banco Popolare SC,  Italy’s fifth-
biggest bank, said profit in the third quarter fell 73 percent
after lending income declined and a year-earlier tax gain wasn’t
repeated.  Net income  fell to 30 million euros ($41 million) from 112
million euros a year earlier, the Verona, Italy-based company
said in a statement today. That compared with the 36 million-
euro average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Pier Francesco Saviotti , who’s
cutting costs and shedding non-strategic assets to recover from
losses linked to Italease SpA, plans to raise 2 billion euros in
a rights offering to boost capital.  “The investor focus will be mostly on the use of the
announced capital increase,” UBS AG analysts  Matteo Ramenghi 
and  Valentina Romitelli , who have a “neutral” recommendation
on the stock, wrote in a Nov. 2 report.  The bank’s core tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial
strength, was unchanged at 6.1 percent as of Sept. 30. Net
interest income dropped to 441 million euros in the third
quarter from 479 million euros a year earlier, while operating
costs declined 2 percent to 600 million euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
