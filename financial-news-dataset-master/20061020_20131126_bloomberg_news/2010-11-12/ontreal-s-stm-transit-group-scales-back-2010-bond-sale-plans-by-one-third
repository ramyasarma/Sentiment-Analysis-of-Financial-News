Societe de Transport de Montreal is
scaling back plans to sell as much as C$300 million ($296
million) in bonds this year by a third because the transit
agency wants more time to study financing options for new subway
cars.  STM now plans to raise a maximum of C$200 million in 10-
year bonds by Dec. 31 to pay for equipment such as escalators
and security cameras, Chief Financial Officer  Luc Tremblay  said
today. The agency is selecting bankers and expects to sell the
debt to Canadian investors, Tremblay said in a phone interview.  Last month, STM awarded  Bombardier Inc.  and France’s Alstom
SA a C$1.2 billion order to build 468 cars for its subway
system, the first step in a 10-year, C$11.9 billion investment
plan to modernize its network. STM must make an initial deposit
on the cars by the end of 2010, Tremblay said.  “We are going to make the payment to Bombardier and
Alstom, but we will make it out of our existing line of credit,
not via a bond sale,” Tremblay said. “We don’t want to commit
to any long-term financing for the metro cars until we have had
time to study all our options.”  To meet short-term liquidity needs, STM can tap a C$100
million secured bank line and a commercial paper program of
C$500 million. Tremblay had said earlier this month the agency
may raise as much as C$300 million by year-end.  Subway-car deliveries are scheduled to start in February
2014 and run until September 2018. When the cost of a new
maintenance center and other investments is factored in, the
STM’s cash outlay will be about C$2.4 billion, Tremblay said.  To pay for the subway cars, STM will consider the sale of
30-year bonds and other “long-term financing options,”
Tremblay said.  “Traditionally we have always done bond financing, but
there are other options out there,” he said. “We are going to
take our time to see which scenario works best for us.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
