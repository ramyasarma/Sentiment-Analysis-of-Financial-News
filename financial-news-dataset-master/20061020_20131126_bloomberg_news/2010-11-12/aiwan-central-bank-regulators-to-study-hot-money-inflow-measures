Taiwan’s central bank, financial
regulator and the finance ministry will study measures to manage
hot-money inflows, the Taipei-based Ministry of Finance said in
a statement on its website today.   The three agencies have agreed to monitor the inflows for
“a period of time” before they implement any measures, the
statement said, without stating the timeframe.   The authorities have already taken actions such as allowing
foreign investors to hold only up to 30 percent of their
portfolios in government bonds and money-market products, and
requiring overseas funds to use dollars as deposits when they
borrow securities.   To contact the reporter on this story:
