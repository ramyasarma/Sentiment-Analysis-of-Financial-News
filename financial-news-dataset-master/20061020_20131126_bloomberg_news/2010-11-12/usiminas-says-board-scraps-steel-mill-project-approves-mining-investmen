Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA , Brazil’s second-largest steelmaker, scrapped a planned steel
mill, citing the project’s “low attractiveness.”  The board decided in a meeting today to cancel the Santana
do Paraiso mill in Brazil’s Minas Gerais state, the steelmaker
said in a regulatory filing. Usiminas, as the company is known,
will instead study how to make its other steel operations more
competitive.  Usiminas suspended construction of the plant in July 2009
after the global financial crisis pared steel demand in Brazil
and abroad.  The company said in a separate statement today that its
board also approved a 550 million-real investment in its mining
operations to boost output capacity to 12 million metric tons by
2012 from 7 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
