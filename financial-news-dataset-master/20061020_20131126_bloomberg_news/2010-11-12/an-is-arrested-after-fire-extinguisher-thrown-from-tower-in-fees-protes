A man has been arrested over an
incident during a demonstration in central London on Nov. 10 in
which a fire extinguisher was thrown at police from the roof of
a tower.  Police in Cambridgeshire arrested the 23-year-old today on
suspicion of violent disorder, the Metropolitan Police said in
an e-mailed statement.  Protesters opposed to government plans to cut university
funding and increase tuition fees smashed glass on the ground
floor of the 27-story Millbank Tower, on the north bank of the
Thames, close to Parliament, and started a fire outside the
building, burning effigies of Conservative Prime Minister  David Cameron  and his Liberal Democrat deputy  Nick Clegg . The
Conservative Party has its headquarters in the complex.  About 2,000 protesters had broken away from a peaceful
demonstration organised by the National Union of Students and
attacked the building, Police Minister  Nick Herbert  told
lawmakers in London yesterday.  The man is in custody at a Cambridgeshire police station,
police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
