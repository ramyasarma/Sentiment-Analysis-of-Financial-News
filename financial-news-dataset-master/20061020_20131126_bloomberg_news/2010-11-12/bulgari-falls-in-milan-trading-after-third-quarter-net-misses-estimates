Bulgari SpA , the world’s third-
largest jeweler, fell the most in three months in Milan after
quarterly profit missed analyst estimates on late introductions
of new watch ranges and declining sales in the Americas.  Bulgari fell as much as 6.5 percent, its biggest decline
since July 30, and traded at 7.02 euros, down 5.8 percent, at
9:20 a.m. local time. The stock was the biggest decliner on the
benchmark FTSE MIB index, which dropped 1.6 percent.  Bulgari, based in Rome, said yesterday after markets closed
that third-quarter net income rose to 16.6 million euros ($23
million) from 7 million euros a year earlier. The average
 estimate  of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 19.8 million
euros.  “Consensus was expecting a turnaround in the third
quarter, which failed to materialize,” Exane BNP Paribas
analysts including  Leopold Authie  wrote in a note today. The
broker maintained its “neutral” rating on the stock, adding
there are more attractive opportunities than Bulgari,
“particularly” Cie. Financiere Richemont SA.  Watch revenue fell 11 percent at comparable exchange rates
in the third quarter after new products didn’t become available
until September. Bulgari introduced its new watches in the
second quarter last year.  Perfume sales fell 4.1 percent after distribution of the
new MAN fragrance began in the third quarter, later than the
June 2009 launch of BLV II.  Timepieces account for about 20 percent of sales, while
perfumes and cosmetics represent 23 percent, the company said
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
