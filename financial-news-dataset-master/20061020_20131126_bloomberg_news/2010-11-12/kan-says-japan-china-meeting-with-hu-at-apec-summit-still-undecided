Japan’s Prime Minister Naoto Kan
said it remains undecided whether he will hold talks with
China’s President Hu Jintao at this weekend’s summit of leaders
from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.  Kan spoke to reporters in Seoul, where he attended the
meeting of heads of the Group of 20 nations. He said he spoke
with Hu for a few minutes at the end of today’s summit. Kan will
host the two-day APEC gathering that begins tomorrow in
Yokohama, near Tokyo.  Relations between Asia’s two biggest economies have
deteriorated since the Sept. 7 collision of a Chinese fishing
boat with Japanese Coast Guard vessels in the East China Sea,
reigniting a dispute over nearby islands claimed by both
countries.  Kan is set to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
during the APEC summit amid a separate territorial dispute. He
said he will use the meeting to assert Japan’s claims to an
island chain that Medvedev visited on Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
