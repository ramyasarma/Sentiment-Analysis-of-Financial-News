China’s commodities futures tumbled
today with cotton, sugar and rubber falling by the daily limits
on speculation China may take additional measures to curb
inflation by lifting interest rates again and selling from
reserves. Copper, zinc and soybeans also slid.  Cotton for May delivery on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange
fell by the 7.5 percent limit to 29,290 yuan a metric ($4,418)
and was at that level by 2:08 p.m. local time. The contract
gained to a record 33,720 yuan on Nov. 10. Sugar for September
delivery declined by 5 percent to 6,895 yuan a ton. It reached
an all-time high of 7,521 yuan on Nov. 9.  Consumer prices  in China jumped 4.4 percent in October, the
fastest pace in two years, the statistics bureau said yesterday.
The government has sold aluminum, zinc, sugar, cotton and corn
this year in an effort to ease supply shortages and curb price
gains. Commodities outside China also slumped today.  “The recent tightening including the reserve ratio hike
this week fueled more expectation that China will accelerate the
pace it increases interest rates,” Tian Feng, analyst at BOC
International (China) Ltd., said by phone from Shanghai.  The People’s Bank of China boosted its benchmark one-year
lending  rate  on Oct. 19 by a quarter of a percentage point to
5.56 percent, the first increase since 2007. The central bank
may raise interest rates within weeks after the latest inflation
number accelerated to the fastest pace in 25 months in October,
a Bloomberg News survey of economists showed.  More Sales   “The government already sold stockpiles of cotton, sugar,
aluminum and zinc, and there’s speculation that it may do more
to suppress prices and contain inflation,” Tian said. “There’s
also market speculation that the government may sell additional
sugar stockpiles, as well as soybean stockpiles.”  Soybeans for September delivery dropped the 4 percent limit
to 4,584 yuan a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange and palm
oil slipped 5 percent to 9,154 yuan.  Copper and zinc on the Shanghai Futures Exchange slid the 5
percent limit to 65,640 yuan a ton and 19,935 yuan,
respectively. China sold 49,992.97 tons of 50,000 tons on offer
from state reserves through auctions on Nov. 9 at below-market
prices. Rubber for May delivery dropped 5 percent in Shanghai to
35,790 yuan a ton.  The People’s Bank of China on Nov. 10 ordered an increase
in bank reserve requirements by 50 basis points from Nov. 16,
the first nationwide increase since May. Some lenders, including
Bank of Communications Co., have to increase their reserve
ratios by an additional 50 basis points from Nov. 15, a person
with direct knowledge of the matter said yesterday.  Rate Speculation  “There’s talk of an interest-rate hike over the
weekend,”said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong
Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “It’s quite
possible given how inflation has accelerated.”  Prices of global commodities also slid today, with cotton
in New York tumbling as much as 3.6 percent to a daily limit of
$1.3418 a pound. Zinc tumbled by the most in two months and
copper dropped from a record on the London Metal Exchange.  Rubber in Tokyo slumped from a 30-year high. April-delivery
rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange declined as much as 4.3
percent to 362.8 yen per kilogram ($4,402 a metric ton).  -- Feiwen Rong . With assistance from Chua Kong Ho in Shanghai.
