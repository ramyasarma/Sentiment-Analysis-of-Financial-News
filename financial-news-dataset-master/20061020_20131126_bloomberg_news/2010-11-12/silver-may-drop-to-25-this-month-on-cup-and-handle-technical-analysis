Silver futures may drop to $25 an
ounce by the end of the month, according to technical analysis
by Steel Vine Investments LLC.  Prices will fall after completing a “cup-and-handle”
formation, a consolidation period followed by a breakout, said
 Spencer Patton , the Chicago-based chief investment officer for
Steel Vine.  The attached chart shows the so-called cup, when prices
approach a high and then take a U-shaped turn, occurred between
Oct. 14 and Oct. 29. When the price reaches its previous high,
investors who bought at or near that level tend to sell and
cause a decline, forming a handle. This occurred on Nov. 1, 2
and 3.  After the “cup-and-handle” is formed, prices tend to
increase significantly, as silver did on Nov. 9 when it touched
a 30-year high of $29.34. Now, the metal will fall to $25,
before rebounding as it tests the pattern, Patton said.  “The technical setup is for a re-test of the breakout
pattern,” Patton said.  “After that test of support, prices
could rise to $30.”  Silver futures for December delivery fell 56 cents, or 2
percent, to $26.845 an ounce at 10:23 a.m. on the Comex in New
York.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
