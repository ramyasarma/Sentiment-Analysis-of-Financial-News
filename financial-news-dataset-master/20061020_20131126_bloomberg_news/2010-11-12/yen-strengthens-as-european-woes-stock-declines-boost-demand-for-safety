The yen advanced against its major
counterparts as stocks declined amid reports showing Europe’s
biggest economies are slowing, fueling concern some countries in
the region will struggle to plug their budget deficits.  Japan’s currency climbed to its strongest level in almost
two months against the 16-nation euro as the Stoxx Europe 600
Index slumped 1.2 percent. Japan’s Economy Minister  Banri Kaieda 
said the country can’t combat gains in its currency alone. The
pound declined against the dollar as a report showed U.K.
consumer confidence fell to a 19-month low in October. Europe’s
currency was set for its biggest weekly drop against the dollar
since the period ended Aug. 13.  “The yen’s gains are primarily a reaction to increased
risk aversion in the market,” said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency
strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in London. “There’s still
ongoing debate about what the Bank of Japan can or should do”
regarding stemming the currency’s gains, he said.  Japan’s currency gained 0.7 percent to 111.90 per euro as
of 9:45 a.m. in London, compared with 112.73 in New York
yesterday. It earlier climbed to its strongest level since Sept.
16. The yen rose to 82.13 per dollar from 82.49, cutting its
decline this week to 1.1 percent. The euro fell to $1.3622 from
$1.3667. It earlier fell to $1.3574, the weakest since Sept. 30.  Stocks fell across Europe as reports showed German and
French growth slowed in the third quarter while the Dutch
economy contracted. The euro area economy grew 0.5 percent in
the third quarter, after expanding 1 percent in the previous
three months, according to a Bloomberg News survey before the
European Union’s statistics office releases the data today.  The British pound lost 0.6 percent to $1.6022, pushing its
decline this week to 1 percent. It snapped six days of gains
versus the euro, trading 0.4 percent weaker at 85.06 pence.  Nationwide Building Society’s  index of consumer sentiment 
in Britain slipped 1 point from September to 52, the lowest
since March 2009, the customer-owned lender said in an e-mailed
statement today. The measure of consumers’ future expectations
fell 4 points to 70, also a 19-month low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
