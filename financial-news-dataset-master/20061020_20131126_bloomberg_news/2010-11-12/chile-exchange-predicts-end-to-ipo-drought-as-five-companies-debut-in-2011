Chile may have five initial public
offerings next year, the most since 2005, as economic growth and
surging equity prices lure investors, according to the Santiago
securities exchange.  “I’ve heard that there will be five companies looking to
do IPOs next year,”  Jose Antonio Martinez , the exchange’s chief
executive officer, said in an interview today. “It’s a
consequence of the recovery of the two last years and the
recuperation of the economy. That means new projects, new
developments, new investment and companies consider this
option.”  Cia. Pesquera Camanchaca SA, a salmon and seafood producer
based in Santiago, is poised to end Chile’s IPO drought this
year in a sale planned for next month, Martinez, 52, said from
the exchange’s downtown Santiago offices. He declined to name
companies that may sell shares next year, saying their plans
aren’t set.  Chilean companies are returning to the equity market as the
economy expands at the fastest pace in five years, recovering
from last year’s recession and February’s earthquake. Chile’s
economy will expand 5 percent to 5.5 percent this year, the
central bank forecast in its latest quarterly monetary policy
report, published Sept. 8. Chile’s  Ipsa index  has surged 39
percent this year, beating the  MSCI EM Latin America Index ’s 9
percent gain.  The planned integration of securities trading in Chile,
Colombia and Peru will increase combined trading volume and give
a further boost to IPO activity, Martinez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
