India’s 12-year bonds completed
their first weekly loss since the period ended Oct. 22 on
speculation some investors sold the notes to make room for
purchases at a government debt auction.  Bonds also dropped this week on concern a cash shortage in
the banking system will sap demand for debt. The notes pared
losses today after a government report showed the pace of annual
growth in  factory output  declined to a 16-month low of 4.4
percent in September. India raised 110 billion rupees ($2.5
billion) selling bonds due 2017, 2020 and 2040.  “Bonds have had a correction this week because of the
tightness in the money market and the government bond auction,”
said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development Credit
Bank in Mumbai. “Yields may not increase further for now as the
industrial data is weak.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022 rose
four basis points this week to 8.06 percent as of the 5 p.m.
close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
The price fell 0.29, or 29 paise per 100 rupee face amount, from
last week to 100.52.  India’s industrial output rose 4.4 percent in September
from a year ago, slowing from a revised pace of 6.9 percent a
month earlier, the Central Statistical Organisation said in New
Delhi today. That was less than the 6.4 percent median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Cash Shortage  Local lenders  borrowed  a record 1.2 trillion rupees ($27
billion) from the central bank yesterday to meet cash shortages.  Overnight  borrowing rates  in the nation’s money market have
averaged 6.3 percent so far this quarter, up from 5.4 percent in
the previous three months, as record share sales by the nation’s
companies drained cash from the financial system. Indian firms
have raised 1.02 trillion rupees from equity offerings this year,
up 42 percent from the amount sold in 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The government sold seven-, 10- and 30-years bonds at
maximum yields of 7.99 percent, 8.10 percent and 8.49 percent,
respectively, at today’s auction.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, climbed 11 basis points during the week to 6.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
