OPEC’s compliance with record supply
cuts was little changed last month as production increases in
six of its member countries offset declines in Iraq, Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela, the International Energy Agency said.  The 11 members bound by quotas produced 26.72 million
barrels a day last month, implying compliance of 55 percent, the
Paris-based IEA said today in its monthly report. That’s down
from a revised 56 percent for September. Supply from all 12
nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
including Iraq, fell by 40,000 barrels a day in October to
average 29.15 million barrels daily, it said.  “OPEC monthly production fluctuations have stayed in a
remarkably stable range this year, within a narrow band of under
300,000 barrels a day,” the agency said.  OPEC, responsible for about 40 percent of world crude
supply, announced its biggest ever production cuts in late 2008
as global demand collapsed. The decision set a cap at 24.845
million barrels a day for 11 of its members. Adherence to the
reduction eased last year as prices rebounded 78 percent.  The compliance percentages are calculated based on the 11
nations targeting a 4.2 million barrel-a-day reduction from a
base production rate of 29.045 million barrels a day in
September 2008.  OPEC kept output quotas unchanged at an Oct. 14 meeting in
Vienna and will meet next on Dec. 11 in Quito, Ecuador.  Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer and the member
conforming best with the output cuts, produced 8.24 million
barrels a day in October, down 40,000 barrels a day from
September, the IEA estimated.  Iraq moved closer this month to solving a political
deadlock over forming a new government, and “it is hoped that
the new government will lead to a more stable and secure
operating environment for the international oil companies
working there,” the IEA said.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
