Japan’s government  bonds  declined
for a fifth week as the yen trading near a one-month low helped
push local stocks to a second weekly gain.  Benchmark 10-year  bonds  dropped the most in two months
after a government report this week showed U.S. employers added
more jobs than economists forecast. The  extra yield  offered by
20-year bonds over 10-year debt was near the widest in more than
two years before an auction of the longer-maturity securities
next week.  “In the light of the improved U.S. economy, it’s unlikely
central banks in Japan and the U.S. will ease policy further and
long-term bond yields will continue to fall,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in Tokyo at Okasan Securities Co.,
one of the 24 primary dealers obligated to bid at the
government’s debt sales.  “The current levels are a watershed
for the bond market. If 10-year yields don’t stop rising here,
1.2 percent will be in sight.”  The 10-year  yield  climbed 6.5 basis points this week to
0.995 percent at the Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. That was the biggest increase
since the week ended Sept. 3. The 1 percent security due
September 2020 fell 0.588 yen to 100.044 yen.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery lost 0.52 to
142.59 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  U.S. employers hired 151,000 workers in October, the Labor
Department said Nov. 5, beating all estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. The economy lost 41,000 jobs the previous month.  The yen fell to 82.80 per dollar on Nov. 10, the lowest
since Oct. 7. The currency traded at 82.33 as of 3 p.m. in Tokyo
yesterday when bond futures stopped trading.  20-Year Auction  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 1 percent this week as
the declining yen increased the value of overseas sales at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  The Bank of Japan cut its key interest rate to a range of
zero to 0.1 percent on Oct. 5 and announced purchases of
government and corporate debt to lower borrowing costs and
counter the yen’s appreciation. A month later, the Federal
Reserve said it would buy an additional $600 billion of U.S.
government debt through June.  The spread between yields on Japan’s 20- and 10-year bonds
was 90 basis points yesterday, after reaching 90.9 basis points
on Oct. 29, the widest since March 2008.  “Twenty-year bonds have a bigger risk of price fluctuation
and are more susceptible to selling as a hedge before the
auction in these unfavorable surroundings,” Okasan’s Bandou
said.  The Ministry of Finance will sell 1.1 trillion yen ($13.4
billion) of 20-year debt on Nov. 18. Primary dealers often
reduce holdings of bonds before an auction in case prices
decline before they can pass on the new securities to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
