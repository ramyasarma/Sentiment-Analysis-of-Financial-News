Chile’s peso headed for its third
weekly decline in four weeks as the dollar strengthened and
investors cut holdings of emerging-market currencies on concern
about Ireland’s ability to pay its debts.  The currency dropped 0.4 percent this week to 479.45 per
U.S. dollar at 8:40 a.m. New York time, from 477.60 on Nov. 5.
It rose 0.2 percent today.  “Ireland’s problems have caused investors to seek out a
refuge in recent days, meaning they prefer the dollar over
emerging currencies,” said  Cristobal Doberti , an economist at
Bice Inversiones in Santiago.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
