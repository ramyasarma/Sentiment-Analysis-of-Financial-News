Emerging-market stocks fell for a
third day on speculation Chinese policy makers may raise
interest rates for the second time in two months as early as
today to curb inflation.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  fell 1.4 percent to
1,122.53 as of 11:35 a.m. in London. The gauge is on course for
a 2.9 percent retreat this week, the most since Aug. 13. China’s
 Shanghai Composite Index  retreated 5.2 percent, the biggest loss
since August 2009. The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index  decreased
1.6 percent to the lowest level in almost two months. Turkey’s
 National ISE 100 index  slid 1.4 percent after the central bank
increased the level of lira reserves that banks must deposit to
6 percent from 5.5 percent.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  and China Vanke
Co. led the nation’s lenders and developers lower after a report
yesterday showed consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in two
years.  “There’s talk of an interest-rate hike over the weekend,”
said  Wu Kan , a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong Insurance
Co., which oversees $285 million. “It’s quite possible given
how inflation has accelerated.”  ICBC, the world’s largest bank, dropped 1.9 percent in
Shanghai.  China Vanke  fell 5.3 percent in Shenzhen trading.  China’s consumer prices increased 4.4 percent from a year
earlier, boosted by food costs, a statistics bureau report
showed in Beijing yesterday, more than the 4 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 28 economists. Property
prices rose in October at the slowest pace in 10 months, after
the government raised interest rates.  Inflation, Policy Risks  The People’s Bank of China may raise its benchmark one-year
lending rate to 5.81 percent by year-end from 5.56 percent,
according to the median forecast of 11 analysts polled after
yesterday’s consumer price data. The deposit rate may climb to
2.75 percent from 2.5 percent, the survey showed.  Inflation and policy risks will cloud “earnings
visibility” at China’s banks in 2011,  Alistair Scarff  and
Michael Li, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in
a report. “Earnings momentum may decelerate due to lower
volume, higher provisions, and potential margin squeeze.”  Metals and oil fell. Zinc for three-month delivery
retreated 3.9 percent in London after China sold 49,993 tons at
auction to cool domestic prices. Crude oil decreased 2.6 percent
to $85.57 a barrel in New York after rallying to the highest in
two years yesterday.  Russia’s  Micex  stock index slid 0.5 percent.  OAO Uralkali ,
the country’s second-largest potash producer, fell 2.4 percent.  Banks led Turkish stocks lower.  Akbank TAS , part-owned by
Citigroup Inc., lost 2.5 percent.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi , in
which Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA has agreed to
take a 25 percent stake, slid 1.7 percent.  Hungary  The Korean won depreciated 1.8 percent, its biggest slide
since June, to 1,127.84 to the dollar. The ruble lost 0.7
percent to 30.7900.  In the Philippines, shares fell for a sixth straight day,
bringing the slump to 7.3 percent since Nov. 4. Before that date
the index gained 44 percent in 2010. The benchmark will extend
losses for the rest of 2010 as investors speculate a recent
rally was overdone, Macquarie Group Ltd. said.  “Share prices have gone up so much in a short time,” said
 Alex Pomento , a Manila-based strategist at Macquarie. “We will
see a correction from here until the end of the year.”  Hungary’s  BUX  stock index gained 1.7 percent after the
statistics office said economic growth picked up to an annual
1.6 percent in the third quarter from 1 percent in the second
quarter.  The difference between the return investors require from
emerging-market bonds and the interest from U.S. Treasuries fell
2 basis point to 2.39 percent, according to the  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. EMBI+ index.   To contact the reporters on this story:
