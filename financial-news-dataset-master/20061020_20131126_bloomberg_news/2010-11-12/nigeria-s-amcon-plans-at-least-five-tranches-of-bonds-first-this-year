Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, a
state-owned company set up to buy bad debt from the country’s
banks, plans to sell at least five tranches of bonds starting
from next month to fund its operations.  The first bonds will be issued by Dec. 30,  Vetiva Capital
Management Ltd. , a fund manager based in the commercial hub of
Lagos, said in an e-mailed note to clients today, citing answers
that Amcon’s executives gave to stockbrokers at a meeting
yesterday at the  Nigerian Stock Exchange . Vetiva didn’t say how
much Amcon would raise through the bond sales.  The first sale will be “zero coupon 3-year bonds which
will be refinanced with a subsequent 7-year issue,” the note
said.  Amcon plans to buy 2.2 billion naira ($14.6 billion) of
toxic debt from commercial banks by the end of the year, the
central bank said on Nov. 9. Many of the bad debts stem from
loans to speculators in the local stock market and operators in
the oil and gas industry.  The central bank of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country
and biggest oil producer, last year fired the chief executive
officers of eight lenders and bailed out the industry with $4.1
billion to avoid a collapse of the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
