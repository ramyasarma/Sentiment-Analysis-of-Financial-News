The Czech central bank said it sees
no need to change interest rates as inflation pressures are
“negligible” and price growth expectations are “well
anchored.”  The Ceska Narodni Banka board voted 5-1 in Prague on Nov. 4
to leave its benchmark two-week repurchase rate at a record-low
0.75 percent, with board member  Eva Zamrazilova  casting a vote
for a quarter-point rate increase, the bank said in the minutes
from the meeting published on its website today.  The board discussed increased uncertainties related to
future economic trends stemming mainly from economic decisions
of central banks and governments abroad, according to the
minutes.  “The prevailing view was that, given the absence of
inflation pressures, the optimal monetary-policy decision in an
environment of such high uncertainty was to leave interest rates
at their existing level,” the bank said in the minutes.  At least one board member said it was “impossible to rule
out virtually any domestic monetary-policy actions” over the
period covered by the new forecast, which ends in 18 months, the
minutes said.  The “new round of quantitative easing” may delay
interest-rate increases in the euro area, Czech policy makers
said in their debate, which could create the risk of “renewed
pressures for excessive appreciation of the koruna,” according
to the minutes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
