Canada will start negotiations on a
free trade agreement with India, the world’s 11th-largest
economy, as Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  seeks new markets for
his country’s goods.  The agreement could boost Canada’s gross domestic product
by at least $6 billion, according to a  study  the two countries
released in September. Trade between Canada and India may triple
to C$15 billion ($14.9 billion) a year within the next five
years, International Trade Minister  Peter Van Loan  said at the
time.  “Our government is committed to opening new markets for
Canadian goods and services,” said Harper, 51, who is in Seoul
for a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 nations.  Canada, which completed eight trade accords since Harper
came to power in 2006, has been turning to bilateral trade
agreements to reduce its dependence on a slowing U.S. economy
amid stalled talks at the World Trade Organization. Canada is
currently negotiating an agreement with the European Union with
the goal of implementing it by the end of next year.  Canada also began negotiations toward a free-trade
agreement with Turkey last month. Officials from Canada and
India will meet in coming days to start talks, according to the
 statement .  To contact the reporters on this story:
