European Aeronautics, Defense and
Space Co.  posted its smallest quarterly profit in a decade as a
weaker dollar crimped earnings and the A380 superjumbo continued
to weigh on profitability.  Net income  was 13 million euros ($17.7 million), or 2 cents
a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 87 million euros,
or 11 cents, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Sales rose 18 percent to 11.2 billion euros. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg had estimated net income of 138 million euros, on
sales of 10.85 billion euros.  Foreign exchange fluctuations cut 850 million euros from
EADS’s adjusted operating profit in the first nine months, the
company said today.  Airbus , the source of two-thirds of EADS
sales, said today that an incident on an A380 last week will
likely affect its delivery schedule for the jet next year.  “In the mid-term, at the current exchange rates, Airbus
should significantly improve its underlying profitability thanks
to better volume, pricing and further economic improvement of
the A380 performance,” EADS Chief Executive  Louis Gallois  said
in the statement.  EADS increased its guidance for earnings before interest
and tax to at least 1.1 billion euros for this year from 1
billion euros, and also raised its outlook for free cash flow to
about 1 billion euros, according to today’s release. That
guidance is based on a euro exchange at $1.35 in the fourth
quarter.  Raising Production  The company is already planning to raise Airbus single-
aisle production to 40 planes a month and today announced that
it will increase building of the A330 and A340 wide-body planes
to nine a month from eight. Production of the A380 has also
improved, and three A380s were delivered each month in July and
August for the first time, EADS said.  Airbus delivered 380 planes in the first nine months of the
year, up from 358 a year earlier, as demand for new aircraft
tracks a rebound in global travel.  As production has come under control, the plane suffered a
blow after a  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  engine exploded on Nov. 4 on
a Qantas Airlines Ltd. flight, prompting the airline to ground
its fleet of six A380s. Rolls-Royce said today that the
explosion was probably caused by an oil fire in its Trent 900
engine that powers the Qantas A380 fleet.  EADS said it aims to wrap up a final contract for its A400M
military transport before yearend after completing negotiations
on an export levy facility. The agreement calls for government
payouts to be more “backloaded than expected” as compared with
a preliminary agreement struck in March, the company said.  Germany, the U.K., France and four other nations will pay
25 billion euros for the planes, 25 percent more than initially
planned, to help Airbus cope with cost increases. That agreement
also let buyers pare orders to 170 planes from 180.  To contact the reporter on this story:
