Power Grid Corp. of  India , the
nation’s biggest transmission company, received at least 1
trillion rupees ($23 billion) of bids on the final day of its
secondary share offer in a record year for asset sales.  Investors bid for 12.2 billion shares, or 14.5 times the
841.8 million shares on offer, as of 5 p.m. local time, data on
the National Stock Exchange  website  showed. Power Grid’s stock
was offered at 85 rupees to 90 rupees apiece. Institutional
investors bid for 18.5 times the shares offered to them,
according to the website.  Rising demand for power to fuel homes and factories in
Asia’s fastest-growing major economy after China attracted
investors to Power Grid after a record initial public offering
in state-owned  Coal India Ltd.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s
government is selling state assets to reduce its budget deficit
and build roads, ports and electricity generating plants.  “The sentiment generated by Coal India has helped this
issue,” said  D.K. Aggarwal , who manages about $100 million as
chairman of SMC Wealth Management Services Ltd. in New Delhi.
“The offer was also at a nice discount.”  Power Grid  shares  declined 1.7 percent to 99.55 rupees in
Mumbai trading today, valuing the company at $9.4 billion. The
shares have retreated 10 percent this year compared with a 15
percent gain in the benchmark  Sensitive Index  of the Bombay
Stock Exchange.  Energy Demand  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , ICICI Securities Ltd., JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and SBI Capital Markets are the advisers for the
Power Grid share sale.  India’s federal government and the company sold 10 percent
each in the offering.  Investors bid for at least $48.7 billion worth of Coal
India shares after the country’s economy grew at the fastest
pace in more than two years in the second quarter, spurring
energy demand. The miner  surged  40 percent on its Nov. 4 trading
debut after the government raised 152 billion rupees last month
selling the stake in the world’s largest coal producer.  Power Grid needs  funds  to expand its transmission network
as utilities build generation capacity to reduce blackouts in
the world’s second-most populous nation.  India’s government has pledged to provide electricity
nationwide by 2012 and needs to increase installed generation
capacity to 200,000 megawatts to sustain economic growth,
according to the power ministry. The current  capacity  is 164,836
megawatts.  Transmission Projects  The company may spend 1 trillion rupees to add 80,000
kilometers (49,720 miles) to its network. The grid’s length was
79,556 kilometers as of Sept. 30, according to the company’s
share-sale  document .  Funds raised in the share sale will be spent on 13
transmission projects, Chairman  S.K. Chaturvedi  said.  Power Grid’s  IPO  in September 2007 attracted bids for 65
times the 573.9 million shares available at 52 rupees apiece and
raised 29.8 billion rupees.  Indian companies have raised a record 350 billion rupees in
IPOs this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
