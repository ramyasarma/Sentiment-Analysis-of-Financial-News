Bank of America Corp .’s plan to sell
its share of China Construction Bank Corp.’s $9.2 billion rights
offer will produce a $458 million gain, Morgan Stanley said in a
report today.  Bank of America sold its rights this week to Temasek
Holdings Pte, Singapore’s state investment company, as the
lender boosts capital to meet a pledge to raise $3 billion from
gains on asset sales by Dec. 31. The Charlotte, North Carolina-
based bank owns 125.58 billion shares in CCB, or 10.95 percent,
trailing only the Chinese government’s 57 percent stake, CCB
said last week.  The rights are valued at $1.79 billion with a likely pretax
gain of $705 million, Morgan Stanley analyst  Betsy Graseck  said
in the report. The gain reflects the 41 percent difference
between CCB’s share price on Nov. 11 and the offering price set
on Nov. 1.  Regulators required Bank of America to boost common equity
through asset sales to escape the Troubled Asset Relief Program
and repay $45 billion in bailout funds. Through Sept. 30 the
bank had recorded $1.9 billion in gains, according to its
quarterly financial report.  The bank declined to comment on the potential gain,
spokesman  Jerry Dubrowski  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
