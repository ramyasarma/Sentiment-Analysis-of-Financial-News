U.K. stocks retreated, led by a
selloff in mining companies amid speculation China may raise its
interest rates, curbing demand for commodities.  Kazakhmys Plc ,  Antofagasta Plc  and  BHP Billiton Ltd . all
fell by more than 2 percent as copper dropped from a record.
 Rolls-Royce Group Plc  paced advancing shares, rebounding from
last week’s selloff.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  lost 18.36, or 0.3 percent, to
5,796.87 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has lost
1.3 percent this week, the biggest retreat since August, amid
concern about Ireland’s ability reduce its budget deficit. The
 FTSE All-Share Index  fell 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s
 ISEQ Index  gained 0.1 percent.  “Speculation has mounted that the Chinese government may
introduce new monetary policy tightening measures,” said Will
Hedden, a London-based sales trader at IG Index. “Commodities
bore the brunt of the news.”  Stocks in Europe pared some losses as Irish government
bonds rose for the first time in 14 days and the cost of
insuring Irish debt retreated. Ireland’s Finance Ministry said
“there are no talks on an application for emergency funding
from the European Union.”  Antofagasta, owner of copper mines in Chile, lost 2.7
percent to 1,432 pence and Kazakhmys slid 3.4 percent to 1,498
pence. BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, fell
2.1 percent to 2,362.5 pence  Metals Drop  Chinese stocks today tumbled by the most since August 2009
and copper fell from a record in London as investors speculated
policy makers may raise interest rates for the second time in
two months to curb inflation.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 2.9 percent to $8,575 a metric ton amid
concern China’s demand for industrial metals may be curbed.
Other base metals also slumped.  Rolls-Royce paced advancing shares, climbing 4.6 percent to
611 pence, paring some of last week’s 8.7 percent selloff. The
company said it will miss its 2010 profit target because of
costs to rectify a failure in the Trent 900 engine that grounded
Qantas Airways Ltd.’s fleet of Airbus SAS A380s.  “Clarity is a positive,” wrote London-based Investec
analyst  Andrew Gollan  in a report to clients. “We continue to
believe the group has strong long-term prospects and hence would
look to buy on any short term weakness.”  Bank of Ireland Gains  Bank of Ireland jumped 6.3 percent to 40.8 cents in Dublin,
rebounding from yesterday’s 7.9 percent drop. The shares have
retreated as the cost of insuring the bonds of Irish banks
soared to distressed levels on concern that the government won’t
be able to afford the cost of bailing out the nation’s banks.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, which owns Ireland’s
Ulster Bank, climbed 2.2 percent to 41.91 pence, trimming its
weekly retreat to 6.9 percent.  Electrocomponents Plc climbed 4.8 percent to 259.8 pence
after the world’s largest distributor of electronics and
maintenance products more than doubled first-half profit.  Catlin Group Ltd. increased 2.2 percent to 358.2 pence
after the third-largest Lloyd’s of London insurer by market
value reported a 9 percent increase in nine-month revenue as the
company gained more premiums from its international divisions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
