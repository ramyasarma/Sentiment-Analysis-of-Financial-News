A decision by Ireland to make use of
the European Financial Stability Facility would be a “circuit
breaker” for the European sovereign debt crisis and boost the
euro, Morgan Stanley said.  Until Ireland’s “eventual recourse” to the EFSF, the euro
may still derive support from a normalization of European
Central Bank monetary policy and “rebalancing demand” from
reserve mangers,  Emma Lawson , a Hong Kong-based currency
strategist, wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Still, the “euro-area sovereign stresses are a significant
risk” for the bank’s forecast that the euro will appreciate
against the dollar into the end of the year, Lawson wrote.  The euro slid 0.3 percent to $1.3632 as of 10:06 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
