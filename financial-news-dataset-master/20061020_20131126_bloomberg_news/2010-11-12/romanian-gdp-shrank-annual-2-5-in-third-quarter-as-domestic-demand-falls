Romania’s  economic decline 
accelerated in the third quarter as a tax increase and public
payroll reductions damped consumer demand in the country of 22
million.  Gross domestic product fell a preliminary unadjusted 2.5
percent from a year earlier compared with a 0.5 percent decline
in the second quarter, the  National Statistics Institute  in
Bucharest said today in an e-mail. GDP contracted 0.7 percent
from the previous three months, after the first quarterly growth
since 2008 in the second quarter.  Romania, which took an  International Monetary Fund -led
bailout last year, will probably see output decline for a second
year in 2010 because of austerity measures implemented in July
to meet budget-deficit targets, IMF Mission Chief  Jeffrey Franks 
said Nov. 1. The government raised the value-added tax by 5
percentage points and cut public wages by 25 percent to narrow
the gap to 6.8 percent of GDP this year and 4.4 percent in 2011.  The IMF forecasts GDP may contract as much as 2 percent in
2010 because of weak consumer demand, after shrinking 7.1
percent last year. The economy may return to growth next year,
when it is forecast to expand as much as 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
