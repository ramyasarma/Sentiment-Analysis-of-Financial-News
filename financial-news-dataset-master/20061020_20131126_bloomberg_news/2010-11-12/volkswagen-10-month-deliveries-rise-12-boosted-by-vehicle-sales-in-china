Volkswagen AG  said sales rose more
than twice as fast as the worldwide auto market last month as
demand for VW and Audi models in the U.S. and China aided its
bid to overtake  Toyota Motor Corp.  as the largest carmaker.  Deliveries by the VW group, which also includes the Skoda,
Seat and Lamborghini brands, increased 9.8 percent from a year
earlier to a record 612,200 cars, sport-utility vehicles and
commercial vans in October, outpacing the industry’s 4.5 percent
sales gain, Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen said today in a
statement.  Volkswagen  is targeting a second consecutive year of record
deliveries as it adds about 70 models, including upgraded
versions of existing vehicles.  Christian Klingler , Volkswagen’s
sales chief, said on Sept. 30 that VW may achieve its goal of
selling 10 million vehicles a year before the target date of
2018. Volkswagen said today that 10-month deliveries climbed 12
percent to 5.98 million vehicles.  “We are continuing to gain global market share,” Klingler
said in today’s statement. “We expect this trend to continue
over the coming months as we systematically progress with our
model initiative.”  Volkswagen’s preferred shares  rose  as much as 1.35 euros,
or 1.2 percent, to 111.95 euros and traded at 111.90 euros as of
12:32 p.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has climbed 71 percent this
year, valuing the company at 48.4 billion euros ($66 billion).  China Factories  The carmaker’s expansion targets rely on success in China,
where VW is adding two factories to double production in its
biggest market to 3 million cars within four years. VW plans to
invest 6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in China for the
construction and to develop new models. Ten-month sales in the
country rose 38 percent to 1.65 million vehicles.  Volkswagen, which will resume production in the U.S. with a
factory being built in Chattanooga, Tennessee, increased 10-
month sales in that market by 21 percent to 295,900.  The namesake VW brand raised deliveries by 12 percent to
3.78 million cars and SUVs in the 10 months through October.
Audi sales rose 16 percent to 916,900. Skoda deliveries advanced
5.5 percent to 69,200, while Seat sales were unchanged at
285,200 vehicles. The commercial-van division’s deliveries
increased 17 percent to 349,000, led by South American growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
