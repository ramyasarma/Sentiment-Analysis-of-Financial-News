European finance ministers said
plans to establish a new crisis resolution mechanism, including
the potential for bondholders to be held accountable, will not
apply to outstanding debt.  “Any new mechanism would only come into effect after
mid-2013 with no impact whatsoever on the current
arrangements,” the finance ministers of Germany, France, Italy,
Spain and the U.K. said in a statement distributed to reporters
in Seoul today.  The role of private investors could involve a range of
possibilities, including a voluntary commitment to maintain
exposures, a commitment to roll over existing debt or the
inclusion of collective action clauses in future bond
emissions, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
