Stocks  of technology companies with
“innovative value” are among the most attractive now, according
to  Louise Yamada , managing director of Louise Yamada Technical
Research Advisors LLC.  “The ones that have innovative value is an area that we
want to be involved in,” New York-based Yamada said in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “We’ve
had a decade of repair, and these areas are coming back” to a
leadership role.  Technology stocks fell from a peak reached a decade ago in
a correction known as the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a
reference to Internet-related businesses. The correction
triggered a bear market in the sector.  The Nasdaq Composite Index reached a record high of
5,132.52 on an intraday basis on March 10, 2000. It touched a
high of 2,552 today, above the average of 2,202 from January
2000 to today.  Yamada, former head of technical research at Citigroup
Inc., also recommended “select industrials, select materials
and consumer staples” along with globally exposed consumer
discretionary stocks.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index tumbled 1.5 percent today
to 1,195 in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial  Average dropped
1.1 percent to 11,159.  To contact the reporters on this story:
