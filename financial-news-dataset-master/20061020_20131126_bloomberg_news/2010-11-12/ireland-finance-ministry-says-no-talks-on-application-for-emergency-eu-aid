Ireland’s Finance Ministry said 
“there are no talks on an application for emergency funding 
from the European Union.”  Ireland is in talks about tapping a European rescue fund
and it is very likely to get aid, Reuters reported today, citing
euro-zone sources it didn’t name.  “Ireland is fully funded into the middle of 2011,” the
Finance Ministry said in an e-mail today. “There is no
application for emergency funding from the European Union.”  Irish government bonds gained for the first day in three
weeks today after European finance ministers said plans for a
new system to handle euro-region debt crises won’t apply to
outstanding debt. Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said in
an interview with RTE Radio today it “makes no sense” to
request aid from the European Union as the government is fully
funded to mid-2011.  The premium that investors demand to hold Irish 10-year
sovereign bonds over the benchmark German bonds was 564 basis
points at 3:59 p.m. in London, down from 646 points yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
