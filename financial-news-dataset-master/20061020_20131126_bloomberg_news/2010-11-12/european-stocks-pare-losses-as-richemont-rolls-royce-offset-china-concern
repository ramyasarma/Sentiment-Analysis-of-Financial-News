European stocks pared losses, as
gains by Cie. Financiere Richemont SA and Rolls-Royce Group Plc
limited declines from speculation that China will raise its
interest rates within weeks to tackle inflation, which
accelerated to the fastest pace in 25 months in October.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.6 percent to
269.8 at 10:54 a.m. in London, after earlier falling 1.6
percent, the largest drop in 11 weeks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
