Vivendi SA’s tax regime, which
allows the company to deduct losses incurred abroad from
domestic profit, won’t be renewed when it expires at the end of
2011, French daily La Tribune reported, citing unidentified
people.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy informed Jean-Bernard
Levy, chief executive officer of Vivendi, of the decision at a
Sept. 7 meeting, the newspaper said. The company and the
president’s office declined to comment, La Tribune added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
