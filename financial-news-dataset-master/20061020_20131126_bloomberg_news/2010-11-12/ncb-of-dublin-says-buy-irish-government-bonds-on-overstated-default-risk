Investors should buy Irish
government bonds, because prices currently overstate the
likelihood of default, according to NCB Stockbrokers Ltd.  “On the assumption of a 70 percent recovery rate, the
Irish 10 year bond yield and 10 year credit-default swap imply
that there is an 85 percent probability of Ireland defaulting
sometime in the next 10 years,” Brian Devine , chief economist
at NCB in Dublin, wrote in a research report today. “We believe
that this overstates the probability of Ireland defaulting and
we therefore conclude that it is rational for investors to
purchase Irish bonds as opposed to risk-free bonds at the
prevailing rates.”  “This is not to say that prices don’t fall further given
that the Irish bond market is currently characterised by fear,”
he said.  Irish bonds snapped a 13-day decline today, pushing the
yield on the 10-year bond down 47 basis points to 8.65 percent
as of 9:06 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
