Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon
Musk said he expects a third of sales will come from Asia by
2015, with equal shares coming from the U.S. and Europe. The
electric-car maker’s plant in Fremont, California may eventually
produce hundreds of thousands of cars a year, Musk said in a
Tokyo briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
