Roche Holding AG ’s Avastin failed to
win the backing of the U.K. National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence for use in combination with chemotherapy
against colorectal cancer that has spread.  No new information submitted during two consultations on
the guidance provided enough evidence to recommend the drug as a
cost-effective treatment, the agency said today in an e-mailed
statement on the final draft guidance.  Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, proposed a fixed cost
to the health system of 20,800 pounds ($33,550) per patient for
a year, and Avastin would be free after 12 months of cumulative
treatment, the agency said. The company also offered to
reimburse the cost of the oxaliplatin component of the
chemotherapy and make an upfront payment for each person
starting first-line treatment with Avastin, also known as
bevacizumab. The agency said the plan was complex and costly to
administer.  “The Cancer Drugs Fund, launched by the Department of
Health in October, now enables oncologists to make treatment
decisions based on clinical judgment rather than on a medicine’s
NICE approval status,” Roche said in an e-mailed. “In light of
the decision by NICE, bevacizumab is one such drug which may now
be prescribed through the Cancer Drugs Fund to patients with
advanced bowel cancer if their oncologist feels they may
benefit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
