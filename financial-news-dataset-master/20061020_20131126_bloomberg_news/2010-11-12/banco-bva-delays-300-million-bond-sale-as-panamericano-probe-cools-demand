Banco BVA SA , a Brazilian bank
specializing in loans to mid-sized companies, delayed an
international bond sale as an accounting probe of rival Banco
Panamericano SA is curbing demand for debt from the country’s
lenders, according to people familiar with the transaction.  The Rio de Janeiro-based bank had planned to sell as much
as $300 million of three-year bonds in its first-ever overseas
foray to yield 7.5 percent as soon as today, said the people who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.
The bank is waiting for borrowing costs to decline before
selling the debt, the people said.  Brazilian bank bonds plunged after Panamericano’s
controlling shareholder, Grupo  Silvio Santos , received a 2.5
billion real ($1.5 billion) loan from the country’s deposit
insurance fund to boost the bank’s capital. Public prosecutors
said today they’re also conducting a criminal investigation of
the bank after regulators uncovered accounting inconsistencies,
sparking investor concern about industry standards.  Yields on dollar debt from Banco Cruzeiro SA, Banco
Industrial e Comercial SA and Banco Bonsucesso SA jumped this
week to the highest level since they were issued this year,
according to data compiled by Trace. The yield on Panamericano’s
8.5 percent dollar notes due in 2020 bonds jumped 230 basis
points, or 2.3 percentage points, to 9.3 percent this week,
prices from Trace show.  Ricardo Rimoli , Banco BVA’s treasurer, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
