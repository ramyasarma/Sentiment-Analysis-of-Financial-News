FirstRand Ltd. said its Momentum
Group unit and Metropolitan Holdings Ltd. have appealed
conditions of their merger set by South Africa’s Competition
Tribunal.  A final decision on the appeal will be taken once the
Tribunal has given reasons for its order, FirstRand said in a
statement to Johannesburg’s stock exchange today. South Africa’s
Competition Tribunal approved the merger on condition that the
companies will not cut jobs, bar senior managers, for two years
after the merger of the companies is completed, the Pretoria-
based antitrust authority said in October.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
