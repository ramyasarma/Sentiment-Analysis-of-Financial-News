Soybean futures advanced to the
highest in more than 26 months on optimism that China’s imports

percent to $13.485 a bushel, the highest price for the most-
active contract on the Chicago Board of Trade since Aug. 28,
2008. Corn for March delivery added 0.3 percent to $5.795 a
bushel, while wheat for March delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$7.475 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
