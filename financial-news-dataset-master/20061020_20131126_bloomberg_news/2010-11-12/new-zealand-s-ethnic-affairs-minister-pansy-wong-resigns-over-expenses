New Zealand Ethnic Affairs Minister
 Pansy Wong , the nation’s first Asian lawmaker, has resigned from
Cabinet as an investigation begins into her travel expenses.  “This action follows questions about use of my travel
entitlement to pay for my husband to travel within China at the
end of 2008,” Wong said today in an e-mailed statement. Her
husband conducted some private business during the trip and she
was unable to give Prime Minister  John Key  an assurance that it
was an isolated incident, she said.  Wong was born in Shanghai and grew up in Hong Kong before
moving to New Zealand. She entered parliament representing the
National Party in 1996 and became the nation’s first Asian
Cabinet minister in 2008, according to the party website. She
was also Minister of Women’s Affairs and associate in the energy
and disability portfolios.  Parliamentary Service will urgently investigate the use of
the international travel rebate, Speaker  Lockwood Smith  said in
an e-mailed statement. Wong requested the review and has said
she’ll make any repayment if there has been misuse, he said.  “It is important that members of parliament and ministers
treat taxpayer money with the utmost respect,” Key said in a
statement. “I am extremely disappointed to lose a minister who
has been an effective and hard-working representative for the
ethnic community and New Zealand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
