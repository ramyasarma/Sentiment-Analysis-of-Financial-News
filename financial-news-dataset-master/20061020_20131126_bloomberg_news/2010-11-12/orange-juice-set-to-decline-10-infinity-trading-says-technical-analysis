Orange-juice futures, up 21 percent
this year, may drop almost 10 percent, according to a technical
analysis by Infinity Trading Corp., a Medford, Oregon-based
brokerage.  Historical charts show prices are forming a “pennant
flag” formation, signaling a change in the rally trend, said
 Fain Shaffer , Infinity’s president. If New York futures slip
below $1.54 a pound, the 20-day moving average, orange juice may
reach $1.411, the lowest level since mid-October, he said.  The market probably will “consolidate and then make a
break,” Shaffer said.  Orange juice for January delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 1
percent, to $1.564 a pound yesterday on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, marking the fifth decline in six sessions. The commodity
reached a three-year high of $1.657 on Sept. 22 as dry weather
threatened to reduce citrus output in Brazil, the world’s
largest grower.  A pennant pattern is formed when the upper and lower trend
lines for prices meet to form a triangle or narrow, tapering
flag shape. Drops below the formation are viewed as bearish.  “Until mid-December, there’s really nothing that’s going
to adversely affect the crop,” Shaffer said. “We’re done with
hurricane season, and it’s too early for frost. The fruit looks
good.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
