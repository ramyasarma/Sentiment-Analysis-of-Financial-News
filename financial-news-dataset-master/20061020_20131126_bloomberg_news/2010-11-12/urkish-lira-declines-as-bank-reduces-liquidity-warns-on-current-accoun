Turkey’s lira fell after the central
bank increased the amount of lira reserves banks must deposit to
6 percent from 5.5 percent to stem liquidity, warning of risks
of loan growth and a widening current account.  The lira dropped 0.5 percent to 1.4440 per dollar at 9:43
a.m. in Istanbul, the lowest level in two weeks.  The bank’s decision, published in the Official Gazette in
Ankara today, returns reserve requirements to the level they
were at before the global financial crisis, when it lowered the
ratio to inject more liquidity. The central bank is attempting
to curb loan growth which has increased at a weekly average of
0.8 percent since January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
