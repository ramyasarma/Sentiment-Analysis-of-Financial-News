The Hungarian forint snapped two
days of losses against the euro after a report showed the
country’s third-quarter gross domestic product grew faster than
economists estimated. Stocks and bonds rose.  The currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 276.39 per euro at
5:13 p.m. in Budapest, trimming its loss for the week to 0.9
percent, the worst performance among more than 20 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The 12-member BUX stock
index rose 1.9 percent, closing the week with a 4.7 percent
retreat, the biggest one-week decline since the five days ended
May 21.  Hungary’s  economic growth  accelerated in the third quarter
as rising domestic consumption and increasing export demand in
western Europe helped the country recover from its worst
recession in 18 years. Gross domestic product grew an annual 1.6
percent after expanding 1 percent in the second quarter, the
Budapest-based statistics office said today. The median estimate
of 10 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 1.2 percent.  “We had quite a strong recovery in the currency from a
very depreciated level this morning,”  Elisabeth Gruie ,
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London, said in a phone
interview. The GDP figure “may indeed have helped the forint to
recoup the losses since the previous day.”  The BUX tumbled 6.9 percent in the previous two days after
the government said it will continue levies on selected
industries beyond 2012. The gauge’s 14-day relative strength
index fell to 27.7 yesterday. Readings lower than 30 suggest to
some technical analysts that a security or an index may gain.  Budget  Hungary’s 2011 budget draft is “risky” because it will
increase the structural deficit and may torpedo the country’s
efforts to emerge from the European Union’s excessive budget
deficit procedure, Central Bank Vice President  Ferenc Karvalits 
said today.  Mol Nyrt. , Hungary’s largest refiner, gained 3.2 percent
today to 19,800 forint.  Gedeon Richter Nyrt. , the country’s
biggest drugmaker, closed 1.7 percent higher at 44,950 forint,
snapping a four-day decline.  The yield on Hungary’s benchmark 8 percent bond, maturing
in February 2015 fell to 6.968 percent from 6.988 percent.
