DeVry Inc ., the parent of for-profit
DeVry University, said the U.S. Department of Education intends
to conduct an onsite program review of the college’s use of
government student aid.  The review is scheduled to start Dec. 6, and will initially
cover the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 award years, Downers Grove,
Illinois-based DeVry said today in a filing.  Apollo Group Inc. ,
the biggest education company by enrollment, said Nov. 4 that
the department would begin a review of the Phoenix-based
company’s use of financial aid on Dec. 6.  Senator  Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat and chairman of the
Senate education committee, has been investigating for-profit
colleges’ use of federal Title IV student grants and loans. For-
profit colleges received about $26.5 billion in U.S. grants and
loans last year, according to the education department, and 74
percent of DeVry’s revenue came from Title IV programs in 2009,
the company said in a filing.  DeVry fell 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $45.93 at the 4
p.m. close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have lost 14 percent in the past 12 months.  “Program reviews are a regular part of the Department of
Education’s toolkit for assuring accountability in Title IV
programs,”  Joan Bates , a DeVry spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
“Our understanding is that there was no specific trigger for
this review and that simply ‘our turn had come up.’”  To contact the reporter on this story:
