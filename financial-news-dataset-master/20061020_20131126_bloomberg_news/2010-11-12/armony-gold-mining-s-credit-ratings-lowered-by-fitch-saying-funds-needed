Harmony Gold Mining Co. , Africa’s
third-largest producer of the metal, had its credit ratings
lowered by Fitch Ratings Ltd. on concern shrinking cash levels
and higher costs will prompt it to increase debt or sell shares.  “High operating cost inflation” may extend until 2015 as
power, labor and water tariffs rise, Fitch said in an e-mailed
statement today. “The company will need to raise additional
equity or debt to finance its future expansionary investment.”  Fitch lowered the long-term foreign-currency issuer default
rating to BB- from BB with a negative outlook. The national
long-term rating was cut to BB- from BBB-, also with a negative
outlook, and the short-term to B from F3.  Harmony is closing some South African shafts as costs rise,
ore becomes depleted and the rand’s gain counters the benefit of
record dollar prices for gold. The company plans to invest in
Papua New Guinea to boost output and diversify geographically.  “It’s disappointing but they apply their own variables,”
 Marian van der Walt , a spokeswoman, said by phone today. “We’ve
positioned the company to deliver on what we’ve promised.”  Harmony’s cash and cash equivalents fell to 770 million
rand ($111 million) by the June 30 end of the fiscal year, from
1.95 billion rand a year earlier.  Harmony rose 0.5 percent to 84.66 rand by 1:02 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading, valuing the company at 36.3 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
