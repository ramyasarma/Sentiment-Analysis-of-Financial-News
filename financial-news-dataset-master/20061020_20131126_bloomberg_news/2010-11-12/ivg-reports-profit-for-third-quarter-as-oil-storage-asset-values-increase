IVG Immobilien AG , Germany’s largest
commercial real estate company, reported a third-quarter profit
as its oil and gas storage caverns increased in value.  Net income was 10.2 million euros ($13.9 million), or 9
cents a share, compared with a loss of 10.4 million euros, or 6
cents, a year earlier, the Bonn-based company said in a
 statement . Revenue fell 6 percent to 136 million euros.  “We are starting to see signs of renewed optimism on the
real estate markets” as Germany’s economic recovery gains
strength, IVG said in the statement. “IVG anticipates a
slightly positive net profit in the fourth quarter.”  IVG, the co-owner of the London office tower known as the
Gherkin, said rents are beginning to stabilize. In August the
company said it didn’t anticipate steady rent recovery in
markets where it operates.  The value of IVG’s caverns rose 49 million euros in the
period compared with a decline of 20.5 million euros in the
value of its other properties and developments. Net asset value
increased 3.8 percent from June 30 to 9.95 euros a share and is
unchanged since the end of 2009.  IVG dropped 1.7 percent in Frankfurt trading to 5.68 euros
as of 9:16 a.m. local time. That pares this year’s increase to
6.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
