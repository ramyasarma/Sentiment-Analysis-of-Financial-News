Saras SpA , owner of the
Mediterranean’s largest oil refinery, and  ERG SpA  forecast
higher refining profits in the fourth-quarter as strikes and
maintenance slow European fuel production.  “The fourth quarter started with healthy margins” helped
by maintenance work in European and U.S. refineries and strikes
in France, Milan-based Saras said today in a stock-exchange
statement. The company also reported an improvement of third-
quarter margins which rose to $1 a barrel from a negative 30
cents a barrel a year ago.  While ERG SpA, Italy’s second-largest refiner, said third
quarter refining was weak, it sees a fourth quarter improvement
with “a slight increase both in average processing and in
refining margins,” according to a company statement published
today.  Slowdowns in production across Europe have boosted demand
for refined products. Saras said its inventories of middle
distillates, a category that includes diesel and jet fuel,
decreased at the start of the fourth quarter as production
failed to keep up with requests.  Saras reported a narrowing of its third-quarter loss today
to 11 million euros from 49.6 million euros a year ago on higher
revenue from refining. ERG posted a third-quarter loss of 13.9
million euros from a profit of 5.2 million euros a year ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
