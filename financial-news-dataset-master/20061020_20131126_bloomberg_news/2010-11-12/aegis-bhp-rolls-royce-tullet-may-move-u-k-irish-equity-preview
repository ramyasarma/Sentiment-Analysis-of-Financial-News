The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in U.K. and Irish
markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses and prices are from
the last market close.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  fell 1.71, or less than 0.1

year guidance was unchanged. The shares lost 1.5 percent to
130.5 pence.  BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BLT LN): Copper tumbled from a record in
London and dropped by the daily limit in Shanghai, as some
investors deemed the rally excessive on concern that China may
step up measures to tighten economic policy, potentially curbing
demand for industrial metals. Other base metals also slumped.
BHP shares rose 0.1 percent to 2,413 pence.  Catlin Group Ltd.  (CGL LN): The third-largest Lloyd’s of
London insurer by market value said nine-month revenue climbed 9
percent as the company gained more premiums from its
international divisions. The stock dropped 1.1 percent to 350.5
pence.  Electrocomponents Plc  (ECM LN): The engineering-supplies
company today reported first-half net income of 34.9 million
pounds, up from 17.1 million pounds a year earlier. The company
also said full-year performance may beat forecasts. The shares
fell 1.6 percent to 247.9 pence.  Misys Plc  (MSY LN): The U.K.-based provider of software for
the financial and health-care industries said it will acquire
capital markets software vendor Sophis for an enterprise value
of 435 million euros.  Misys also announced the tender offer terms for the return
to Misys shareholders of 670 million pounds of proceeds from the
sale by Misys of Allscripts shares. The shares lost 0.5 percent
to 295.5 pence.  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  (RR/ LN): The world’s second-largest
maker of engines said it will replace a part in Trent 900
engines after the failure of a turbine on a Qantas Airways Ltd.
A380 flight last week.  The blowout was caused by the failure of a “specific
component in the turbine area of the engine,” Rolls-Royce said
in a statement today. Separately, Rolls-Royce said trading
across the group’s businesses has progressed “in line” with
the guidance for “modest growth provided in July 2010.” The
shares fell 0.7 percent to 584 pence.  Tullett Prebon Plc  (TLPR LN): The London-based firm said
