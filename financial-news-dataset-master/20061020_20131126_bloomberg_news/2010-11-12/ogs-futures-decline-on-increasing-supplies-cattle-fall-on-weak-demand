Hog futures fell for the first time
in three days in Chicago on signs of ample pork supplies. Cattle
declined on the outlook for weak demand.  The average  hog-carcass  yesterday weighed 209.3 pounds
(94.9 kilograms), just under the highest level since at least
2002 that was reached on Oct. 29, according to U.S. Department
of Agriculture data. Heavier animals yield more meat. The
 wholesale pork  price is down 1.7 percent this week. The most-
active hog contract gained 19 percent in the year ended
yesterday.  “The weight situation is still going to be something that
lingers,” said  David Kruse , the president of CommStock
Investments Inc. in Royal, Iowa. “We’ll have supply as we look
out into next year.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.85 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 74.6 cents a pound at 9:50 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The contract has gained 1.5 percent for the
week, heading for the second straight weekly increase.  Commodities tumbled today on speculation that China may
attempt to rein in inflation by raising interest rates, curbing
demand for some raw materials. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies  CRB 
Index of 19 raw materials declined as much as 2.3 percent and is
headed for the first weekly drop since Aug. 20.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.575 cent, or
0.6 percent, to $1.023 a pound. Before today, the most-active
contract rose 20 percent in the past year.  Yesterday , wholesale choice beef  fell for the third day in
a row, dropping 0.2 percent to $1.5708 a pound, the lowest level
since Oct. 18. The price has dropped 8.4 percent from this
year’s high of $1.714 on May 11.  “We’re not in a good time frame seasonally for beef,”
Kruse said. Demand’s “not there right now. The margins in the
beef industry are being eroded everywhere.”  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.025
cent to $1.151 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
