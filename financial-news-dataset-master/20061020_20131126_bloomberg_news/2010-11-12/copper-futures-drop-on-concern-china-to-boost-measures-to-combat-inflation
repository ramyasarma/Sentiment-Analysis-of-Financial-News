Copper tumbled from a record in
London and dropped by the daily limit in Shanghai, as some
investors deemed the rally excessive on concern that China may
step up measures to tighten economic policy, potentially curbing
demand for industrial metals. Other base metals also slumped.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 2.9 percent to $8,575 a metric ton and
traded at $8,579 at 4:09 p.m. Singapore time. The contract,
which reached a record $8,966 a ton yesterday, is down 0.9
percent this week.  “The rally before was excessive so we’re seeing an equally
strong pullback,” Li Rong, chief analyst at Great Wall Futures
Co., said from Shanghai. “Speculation is rife that China may
hike interest rates again as early as this evening.”  December-delivery copper on the Comex in New York fell as
much as 2.9 percent to $3.911 a pound, while Shanghai futures
dropped the daily 5 percent limit to 65,640 yuan ($9,899) a ton.  “It’s an aggressive decline across the board as longs
liquidate at the end of a week which saw a phenomenal rise in
prices,” Rao Zhi, an analyst at Yunchen Futures Co., said from
Yunnan. “The longer-term positive fundamentals, especially for
copper, remain intact and the recovery story hasn’t changed.”  Zinc led declines on the London Metal Exchange, falling as
much as 4.7 percent, the most since Sept. 9, to $2,422.50 a ton.
China sold almost all of the 50,000 tons of zinc ingots it
offered at a state auction on Nov. 9 for an average price of
19,511 yuan a ton, the National Development and Reform
Commission said today.  China Tightens  China will raise interest rates by 25 basis points before
the end of the year after producer and consumer prices took both
markets and the government “by surprise,” HSBC Holdings Plc.
said today. Consumer prices gained a more-than-forecast 4.4
percent from a year earlier in October, the statistics bureau
said yesterday.  Policy makers raised reserve requirements for some banks
twice yesterday, taking the total increase to 100 basis points
for a few lenders, said two people with direct knowledge of the
situation. China last month raised interest rates for the first
time since 2007 to cool inflation and has taken multiple
measures since April to curb property speculation.  Aluminum in London fell 1.5 percent to $2,420 a ton, lead
declined 3.3 percent to $2,525 a ton, nickel decreased 2.5
percent to $23,400 a ton, and tin slumped 3.2 percent to $26,125
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
