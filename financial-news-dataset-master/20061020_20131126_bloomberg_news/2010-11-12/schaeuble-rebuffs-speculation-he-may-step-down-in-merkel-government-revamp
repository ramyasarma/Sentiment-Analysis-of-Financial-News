German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble rejected talk that he may leave his post as part of a
wider German government revamp.  “The chancellor has said that this is pure invention,”
Schaeuble said in an interview with Germany’s Deutschlandfunk
radio from Seoul, where Group of 20 leaders are meeting.  “There’s no reason to comment on pure invention,” Merkel
said in an interview earlier today from Seoul.  Merkel will name Thomas de Maiziere finance minister,
replacing Schaeuble, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported, citing
unidentified officials from Merkel’s Christian
Democratic Union party. Merkel hasn’t decided yet when to make
the changes, Handelsblatt said.  Reports about a possible departure of Schaeuble were fueled
again as his chief spokesman resigned this week five days after
he was rebuked by the minister in public. This happened after
Schaeuble spent four weeks in hospital last month with an
ailment related to his wheelchair use, forcing him to miss the
International Monetary Fund’s fall meetings in Washington.  He was unable to travel to the IMF’s spring meeting and had
to pull out of at least two rounds of European Union talks this
year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
