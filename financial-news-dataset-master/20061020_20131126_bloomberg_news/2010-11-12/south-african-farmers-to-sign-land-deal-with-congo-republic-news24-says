South Africa may make a land deal
with the  Congo Republic  this month, allowing farmers to start
operating in the Central African nation,  News24  reported, citing
Agri SA Deputy President Theo de Jager.  The transaction would give South African farmers the
opportunity to expand and help to improve that country’s food
security, the Johannesburg-based online news agency said. South
African farmers may be able to lease land for as long as 105
years to grow corn, soy, poultry and dairy, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
