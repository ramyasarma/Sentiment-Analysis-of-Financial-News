U.S. stocks retreated, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest weekly drop in three
months, amid concern China may raise interest rates to curb
inflation.  Apple Inc.  slipped 2.7 percent after  Kenneth Heebner , the
manager of the top-performing diversified U.S. mutual fund in
the past 10 years, sold most of his stake. Alcoa Inc., Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Barrick Gold Corp. sank more than
2 percent as metals declined. Schlumberger Ltd., the largest
oilfield-services provider, fell 1.2 percent as oil dropped.
Nvidia Corp. surged 5.2 percent as earnings beat estimates.  The  S&P 500  fell 1.2 percent to 1,199.21 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks dropped 2.2 percent
this week amid renewed concern about the levels of debt in the
weakest European economies. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
lost 90.52 points, or 0.8 percent, to 11,192.58 today.  “The market is in the midst of a correction, which is well
overdue,” said  Michael Mullaney , who helps manage $9.5 billion
at Fiduciary Trust Co. in Boston. “The surprises are still on
the upside as far as earnings are concerned, and we think that
will continue.”  The S&P 500 snapped a five-week rally, its longest since
April. The index gained 19 percent from its 2010 low in July
through yesterday amid improving earnings and speculation the
Federal Reserve will stoke growth by pumping cash into financial
markets. Earnings per share have topped estimates at 76 percent
of the 433 companies in the index that reported since Oct. 7,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Apple Tumbles  Apple fell 2.7 percent to $308.03. Heebner sold most of his
stake in the iPod and iPhone maker in the third quarter. His
Capital Growth Management LP sold 1.04 million Apple shares,
leaving his holdings at 110,000 shares, according to a filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  slumped 5.2 percent today,
the most in 14 months, as inflation figures released yesterday
added to concern that the nation may soon increase interest
rates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said yesterday that October’s
economic data indicated Chinese growth was “firm” and more
“policy tightening” is needed.  “In China, one of the main pillars of growth, investors
will start pricing in a tighter monetary policy,” said  Tammo Greetfeld , senior equity strategist at UniCredit Research in
Munich. This is “clouding the overall economic growth
outlook.”  Aluminum  Alcoa , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, sank 2.3 percent
to $13.49. Copper tumbled 3.3 percent in New York amid concern
that any tightening of economic policy in China would curb
demand for industrial metals.  Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly traded
copper producer, declined 3.8 percent to $103.92. Barrick Gold,
the world’s largest miner of the metal, slumped 2.2 percent to
$50.733 as gold futures tumbled 2.7 percent to $1,365.50 an
ounce.  Schlumberger  slipped 1.2 percent to $74.11 as crude for
December delivery fell $2.93 to settle at $84.88 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Exxon Mobil Corp. lost 1.2 percent
to $70.99.  D.R. Horton Inc., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder by
revenue, lost 5.4 percent to $11.51. Chief Executive Officer
 Donald Tomnitz  said on an earnings call with analysts that
achieving profitability in 2011 will be a “greater challenge”
as sales will be slower. The company reported a narrower loss
for the fourth quarter as the company reduced writedowns and
impairments.  ‘Unanimously Weak’  “The market is unanimously weak,” said  Lawrence Creatura ,
a Rochester, New York-based fund manager at Federated Investors
Inc., which oversees about $350 billion. “There aren’t many
places to hide today.”  Nvidia, the maker of chips for computer graphics cards,
rose 5.2 percent to $13.26 for the second-biggest gain in the
S&P 500. The company said third-quarter adjusted earnings beat
estimates and forecast fourth-quarter revenue will top the
average analyst prediction.  Walt Disney Co. advanced 5.1 percent to $37.75 for the
biggest gain in the Dow average. The world’s biggest media
company dropped yesterday in regular trading after its fourth-
quarter earnings report was released early. The stock recovered
losses in extended trading and climbed today as management said
on a conference call that the company will return capital to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its 12-month price estimate for
the stock to $43 from $42.  Stocks briefly pared losses earlier as a gauge of consumer
confidence topped estimates. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan  preliminary sentiment index  rose to 69.3, advancing for
the first time in three months and reaching the highest level
since June. The number was in line with the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the highest level
since June, from 67.7 in October.  Materials producers fell 2.2 percent as a group, the most
among 10 industries in the S&P 500. CF Industries Holdings Inc.,
