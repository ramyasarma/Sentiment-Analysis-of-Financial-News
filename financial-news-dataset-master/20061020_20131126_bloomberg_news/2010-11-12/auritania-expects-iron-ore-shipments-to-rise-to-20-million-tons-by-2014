Mauritania , Africa’s second-biggest
iron-ore producer, expects exports of the metal to surge 67
percent to 20 million metric tons by 2014, said el-Ghaouth Ould
Memadi, an official at  Societe Nationale Indutrielles et
Miniere .  Shipments will be boosted by the opening of the Guelb 2
mine in 2012 and three other mines in the following two years,
Memadi said in at a conference on Nov. 10 in Nouakchott, the
capital.  Reserves in the northern Tiris region are estimated at 45
billion tons, Memadi said.  SNIM, the state-owned iron-ore producer, generates about 40
percent of Mauritania’s export revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
