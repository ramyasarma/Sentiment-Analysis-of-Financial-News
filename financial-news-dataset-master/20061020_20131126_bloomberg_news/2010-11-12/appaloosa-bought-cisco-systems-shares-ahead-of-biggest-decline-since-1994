Appaloosa Management LP bought a new
stake in  Cisco Systems Inc.  during the third quarter, before the
shares posted the biggest one-day decline since 1994 yesterday.  Appaloosa, founded by billionaire investor  David Tepper ,
purchased 6 million shares of Cisco during the quarter that
ended in September, according to a filing today with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Cisco, the world’s largest maker of computer networking
equipment, plunged 16 percent to $20.52 yesterday after its
profit and sales  projection  missed the average analyst
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock
ended the third quarter at $21.90.  The Short Hills, New Jersey-based firm also bought 3.7
million shares of  Hewlett-Packard Co. , the biggest computer
maker, and 5.2 million shares of Pfizer Inc., the world’s
biggest drugmaker.  The hedge fund, which bought bank shares in 2009 after the
U.S. government announced plans to prop up the industry, cut
stakes in financial companies for the third quarter in a row,
according to a regulatory filing. His holdings in Bank of
America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and  Fifth Third Bancorp  were
reduced by 4.9 million, 6.5 million and 2.4 million shares,
respectively.  Best Showing  As a result of the bank-stock investments last year,
Tepper’s flagship fund, Appaloosa Investment LP, had a 117.3
percent return for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2009. That
was the best showing among hedge funds with assets exceeding $1
billion, Bloomberg data show.  The fund had a return, after fees, of 5.1 percent last
month, The New York Times reported on Nov. 9 in its Dealbook
blog, citing the monthly results released to its investors. The
fund has returned 20.9 percent this year through the end of
October, Dealbook said.  This wasn’t the first time that Tepper bought Cisco. He
bulked up on technology companies like Cisco, Microsoft Corp.
and Oracle Corp. in 2006 because he felt they had excess cash to
pay dividends and buy back stock. He bought shares in 2007 as
well, before selling gradually and exiting out of the position
entirely by the first quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
