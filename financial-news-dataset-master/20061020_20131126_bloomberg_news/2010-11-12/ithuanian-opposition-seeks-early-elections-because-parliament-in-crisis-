Lithuania’s opposition Labor Party
said it is collecting lawmakers’ signatures to call early
elections after the Seimas, or parliament, failed to eject a
member who violated the Constitution.  “It’s obvious that the Seimas is in a crisis,” Vytautas
Gapsys, head of the Labor group in parliament, said today in a
statement. “Such a parliament as we have now cannot continue
working.”  Parliament yesterday fell short of approving a resolution
to remove lawmaker Aleksandr Sacharuk after the Constitutional
Court ruled he broke the law by voting in place of an absent
colleague. To dissolve parliament, 85 members of the 141-seat
legislature must support the initiative.  The opposition is unlikely to gather the needed 85 votes,
said Parliamentary Chairman  Irena Degutiene , the Baltic News
Service reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
