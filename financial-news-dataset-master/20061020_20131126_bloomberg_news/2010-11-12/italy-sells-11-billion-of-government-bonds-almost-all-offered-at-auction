Italy sold 7.92 billion euros ($10.9
billion) of bonds maturing between 2015 and 2034, some 4 percent
off its target, reassuring analysts amid concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis would weigh on demand at today’s auction.  The 3 percent November 2015 notes were sold at an average
yield of 3.24 percent and attracted bids worth 1.41 times the
securities on offer, the Italian debt agency said. The 4.5
percent March 2026 bonds were sold at an average yield of 4.81
percent at a bid-to-cover rate of 1.3. The 5 percent August 2034
bonds were sold at an average yield of 5.12 percent and a bid-
to-cover of 1.72.  “It was a good auction,” said  Chiara Cremonesi , a fixed-
income strategist at UniCredit SpA in London. “Italy managed to
sell near the maximum announced, bid to covers look fine and the
three bonds were all sold at a price above market level ahead of
the auction.”  The yield premium that investors demand to hold Italian 10-
year bonds over benchmark German bunds narrowed two basis points
to 177 after earlier widening to a record 186 basis points.
Italy’s success in containing its budget deficit has kept the
yield  spread  over bunds narrower than those for other so-called
euro peripheral nations. Ireland’s gap reached a record 652
basis points yesterday, while Portugal’s touched 484, also a
record.  Italian 10-year yields rose one basis point to 4.25 percent
as of 11:57 a.m. in London. The 3.75 percent security due March
2021 fell 0.08, or 80 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to
96.190. Italian two-year yields fell nine basis points to 2.38
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
