Cyrela Brazil Realty SA
Empreendimentos e Participacoes , Brazil’s biggest homebuilder,
said third-quarter profit fell 33 percent on project delays and
a one-time gain that boosted earnings in the same period last
year.  Net income fell to 176 million reais ($102.6 million) from
264.1 million reais a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company
said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The earnings fell short
of the  average estimate  of 190.9 million reais by seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Approvals and registrations were delayed for some
projects” in the quarter, and their new projects postponed to
early October, the company said in the filing. Cyrela also had a
non-recurring gain of 80.6 million reais from the sale of its
share in Agra Empreendimentos Imobiliarios SA in the third
quarter of 2009, the company said.  Cyrela said total contracted sales including partners’
shares fell 37 percent to 1 billion reais, and those exclusive
to Cyrela fell 34 percent to 806.8 million reais.  Total value of new projects fell 30 percent to 1.36 billion
reais due to delays in approvals and registrations. New projects
up to Nov. 10 totaled 2 billion reais and the company expects to
meet its sales forecast for the year, according to the
statement.  Cyrela’s shares rose 1.2 percent to 21.16 reais in Sao
Paulo trading at the 4 p.m. New York time market close
yesterday. The company has fallen 14 percent so far this year,
while Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index has risen 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
