Kinross Gold Corp.  will spend $1.5
billion on  Mauritania’s  Tasiast mine that it acquired in
September, according to the northwest African nation’s mines and
industry minister.  Production of the precious metal at the mine will be an
annual 1 million ounces,  Mohamed Abdellahi Ould Oudaa  told
reporters at a mining-industry conference in Nouakchott, the
capital, yesterday.  Shareholders of Toronto-based Kinross approved its C$7.4
billion ($7.3 billion) acquisition of Australia’s Red Back
Mining Inc., including its mines in Mauritania and  Ghana ,
Africa’s second-biggest gold producer.  Steve Mitchell , a spokesman for Kinross in Toronto, said
the company’s feasibility study on the project is due to be
completed in mid-2011. The company hasn’t disclosed an estimate
for capital expenditure at Tasiast, he said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
