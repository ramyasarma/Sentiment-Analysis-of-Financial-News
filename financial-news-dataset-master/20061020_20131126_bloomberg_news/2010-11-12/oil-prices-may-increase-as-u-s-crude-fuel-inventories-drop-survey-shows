Oil may increase next week after an
Energy Department report showed that U.S. crude and fuel
inventories tumbled, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Sixteen of 37 analysts, or 43 percent, forecast crude oil
will climb through Nov. 19. Twelve respondents, or 32 percent,
predicted prices will fall and nine estimated there would be
little change. Last week, 59 percent said futures would
increase.  U.S. crude oil  supplies  dropped 3.27 million barrels to
364.9 million last week, an Energy Department report showed Nov.
10. Stockpiles were forecast to increase 1.5 million barrels,
according to the median of 15 responses in a Bloomberg News
survey. Inventories of gasoline and  distillate fuel , a category
that includes heating oil and diesel, fell more than estimated.  “The numbers now support fully the idea that stocks have
peaked for the year,” said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron
Hanover Inc., a trading-advisory company in New Canaan,
Connecticut. “Everything has come together for the bulls. I
expect higher prices.”  Consumption  of distillate fuel  surged 7 percent to 4.39
million barrels a day in the week ended Nov. 5, the highest
level since August 2008, the Energy Department report showed.
Demand was up 24 percent from a year earlier. Total fuel use
climbed 1.5 percent to 19.6 million barrels a day.  Crude oil for December delivery declined $1.97, or 2.3
percent, to $84.88 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract touched $88.63 yesterday, the highest
intraday price since Oct. 9, 2008. Oil is up 10 percent from a
year ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
