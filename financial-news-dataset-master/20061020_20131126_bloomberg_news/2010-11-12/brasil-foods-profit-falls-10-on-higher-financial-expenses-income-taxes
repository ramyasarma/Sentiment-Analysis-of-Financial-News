BRF Brasil Foods SA , the world’s
largest poultry exporter, said third-quarter profit fell 10
percent as financial expenses and taxes climbed.  Net income  declined to 190 million reais ($110 million), or
22 centavos a share, from 211 million reais, or 24 centavos, in
the year-earlier period, the Sao Paulo-based company said today
in a regulatory filing. Brasil Foods was expected to report
earnings per share excluding some items of 23 centavos, the
 average estimate  of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Revenue  that climbed 8 percent to 5.7 billion reais was
offset by higher financial costs and taxes. The company booked a
financial expense of 47 million reais, compared with a gain of
223 million reais a year earlier, while taxes rose more than
fourfold to 107 million reais.  Sales in the domestic market, the source of almost three-
quarters of its revenue, climbed 8 percent to 4.12 billion
reais. International sales increased 5 percent.  Domestic demand is expected to increase as Brazil’s economy
may expand at the fastest pace since 1985, according to a
central bank survey with about 100 economists on Nov. 8.  Brasil Foods , which was formed by Perdigao SA Comercio &
Industria’s takeover of Sadia SA in 2009, owns 60 plants in
Brazil that produce meat and dairy products and margarine.  Brasil Foods fell 6 centavos, or 0.2 percent, to 25.14
reais at 6:06 p.m. in Sao Paulo. Earnings were released after
the market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
