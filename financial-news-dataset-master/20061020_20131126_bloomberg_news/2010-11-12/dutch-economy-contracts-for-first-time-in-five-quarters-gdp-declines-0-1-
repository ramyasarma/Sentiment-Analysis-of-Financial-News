The Dutch economy contracted for the
first time in more than a year in the third quarter as export
growth slowed and investment declined.  Gross domestic product  shrank 0.1 percent from the previous
three months, when it rose a revised 0.9 percent, the national
statistics bureau in The Hague said today on its  website . That
was the first contraction since the second quarter of last year.  “We were in fact expecting a small plus in the third
quarter, like in France and Germany,” Dutch Economic Affairs
Minister  Maxime Verhagen  said in an e-mailed statement. “I also
see some worrying developments in Europe’s financial markets.
The Ireland situation shows that the economic recovery will
remain fragile.”  German GDP increased 0.7 percent from the previous three
months, when it surged a record 2.3 percent, while third-quarter
growth in France slowed to 0.4 percent from 0.7 percent in the
prior period. For the 16-nation euro area, growth slowed to 0.4
percent from 1 percent in the previous three-month period, which
was the fastest pace in four years.  In the Netherlands, investment dropped 3 percent from a
year earlier and natural-gas exports weakened, the Dutch
statistics bureau said. Third-quarter economic growth slowed to
1.8 percent from a year earlier, compared with 2.2 percent in
the previous three months, the bureau said.  The Netherlands’  trade balance  rose to 4.57 billion euros
in September from 4 billion euros a year earlier, while
September retail sales rose 2.9 percent, the agency said in
separate reports today.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:  Martijn van der Starre  in
