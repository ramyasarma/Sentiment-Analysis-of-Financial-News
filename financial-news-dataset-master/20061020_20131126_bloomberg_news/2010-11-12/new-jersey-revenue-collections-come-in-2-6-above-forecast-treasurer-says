New Jersey , the second-wealthiest
U.S. state by per-capita income, collected 2.6 percent more than
forecast during the first four months of the fiscal year, led by
income taxes, Treasurer  Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff  said.  The $243 million gain in income-tax collections, 10 percent
above projections, was partially offset by sales-tax returns,
which trailed estimates by $44 million, or 1.7 percent, through
October, Sidamon-Eristoff said in a statement today. The fiscal
year began July 1.  Through October, taxes generated $7.8 billion, compared
with $7.6 billion expected when the $29.4 billion state budget
was signed by Governor  Chris Christie  in June.  “Collections appear to have stabilized, but they haven’t
grown significantly beyond conservative budget forecasts,”
Sidamon-Eristoff said. “While it’s somewhat comforting that
we’re meeting projections, revenue remains severely constrained
from a historical perspective.”  Cash collections through the first four months of the year
have grown by 2.3 percent over the same period a year ago, the
state’s worst year for tax revenue since 2006, according to the
Treasury Department statement.  New Jersey ranked second behind Connecticut with $50,313 in
per-capita income in 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Connecticut’s per-capita income was $54,397.  To contact the reporter on this story:
