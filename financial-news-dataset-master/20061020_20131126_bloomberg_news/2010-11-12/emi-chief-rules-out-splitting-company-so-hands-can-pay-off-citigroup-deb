EMI Group Ltd. ’s Chief Executive
Officer  Roger Faxon  quelled speculation the record company would
be split and parts sold off to competitors to raise funds so
owner  Guy Hands  can meet debt payments to  Citigroup Inc .  According to an internal memo to employees obtained by
Bloomberg News, Faxon said EMI was “easily meeting all its debt
obligations” and wasn’t in danger of “any form of
bankruptcy.” An EMI spokesman declined to comment.  Faxon was responding to press reports that EMI was being
circled by rivals since Hands lost a court battle to Citigroup
this month after alleging he was tricked into overbidding for
EMI in 2007.  Warner Music Group Corp.  and BMG Rights are among
companies that have expressed an interest in buying EMI’s
publishing and recorded assets. Faxon was named CEO of the
company in June.  According to the memo, no rival could financially
“stomach” the demands of taking over another big company and
regulatory issues would present obstacles, as they did when
Warner and EMI attempted to merge in 2000.  Though splitting EMI was considered in the past, Faxon said
it was abandoned because “the best way to build value is for
EMI to remain as one company.” Selling off catalog assets was
ruled out as “utterly idiotic,” according to the memo, as it
would lower the value of the rest of EMI.  “You might make a quick buck, but you’re left with a
company that is suddenly weaker than it was before,” Faxon said
in the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
