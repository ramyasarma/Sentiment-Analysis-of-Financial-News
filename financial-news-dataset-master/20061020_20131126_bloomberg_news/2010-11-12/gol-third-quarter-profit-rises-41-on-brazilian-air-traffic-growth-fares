Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA ,
the biggest Brazilian airline by market value, said third-
quarter profit rose 41 percent as traffic growth and fuller
planes allowed the company to raise prices.  Net income rose to 110 million reais ($64 million) from
77.9 million reais a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Gol said
today in a regulatory filing. The  average estimate  for profit
excluding some items was 123.6 million reais in a Bloomberg
survey of four analysts. Sales increased 20 percent to
1.79 billion reais.  Brazilian gross domestic product will grow 7.6 percent this
year, according to a central bank survey of economists published
Nov. 8. Air travel in Latin America’s largest economy expanded
27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, while
demand for Gol flights increased 18 percent, and the carrier’s
average fare increased 7.3 percent, the airline said.  “Flexible management of fares, with more accessible prices
for prepaid tickets, and the revival of the miles program” for
frequent travelers have helped Gol increase traffic,  Jacqueline Lison , an analyst at Banco Fator SA in Sao Paulo, wrote in a
Nov. 9 report.  Tam SA  accounts for 43 percent of the Brazilian airline
market, with Gol holding 39 percent, according to ANAC, the
national aviation agency. Tam, which is also based in Sao Paulo,
is scheduled to report  third-quarter earnings  on Nov. 16.  Third-quarter seat-capacity use, or load factor, increased
to 71.1 percent from 67.6 percent a year earlier on domestic
flights, Gol said. The load factor on international flights
jumped 21.2 percentage points to 72.2 percent.  Gol  fell 1.6 percent to 28.04 reais in Sao Paulo yesterday.
The stock has risen 7.5 percent this year, while Tam has
increased 7 percent and the  benchmark Bovespa index  has added
3.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
