China will raise interest rates by
25 basis points before the end of the year after producer and
consumer prices took both markets and the government “by
surprise,” HSBC Holdings Plc. said.  “Inflationary pressures remain in the pipeline,” Qu
Hongbin, co-head of Asian economic research, said in a note.
Retail sales growth and domestic investment will help keep the
economic recovery on track, assuring the government that the
“real economy” will remain “relatively buffered” from the
impact of its latest tightening measures, the note said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
