A senior member of  Aung San Suu Kyi ’s party said a release order has been signed for the Myanmar
opposition leader and that she may be freed from house arrest
“today or tomorrow.”  Suu Kyi, who has been detained for 15 of the past 21 years,
is scheduled to be released on Nov. 13, according to the terms
of her most recent house arrest. Myanmar’s junta hasn’t said
publicly whether it will free the 65-year-old Nobel Peace Prize
laureate a week after the party it backed claimed a landslide
election victory.  “We’ve been told her release order has been signed and she
can be released today or tomorrow, but government officials
won’t confirm this,”  Win Tin , a senior member of Suu Kyi’s
 National League for Democracy , said by phone from Yangon.  Suu Kyi’s release and the conditions surrounding it may
trigger a review of U.S. and European sanctions against the
regime for human rights abuses, including the jailing of 2,100
political prisoners.  If freed, Win Tin said Suu Kyi plans to tour the country
and may reconsider her views on sanctions on Myanmar, after last
week’s vote paved the way for the formation of the nation’s
first multi-party parliament since 1962.  “She essentially controls U.S. policy, indirectly,” said
David Steinberg, director of Asian studies at Georgetown
University. “We think what she thinks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
