Hong Kong’s highest court ruled that
a city businessman must pay his former wife half his wealth,
upholding a 2008 decision that asset splits in divorces should
be based on a principle of equal division.  “To confine a non-working wife’s award to the sum needed
to meet her ‘reasonable requirements’ and to permit the husband
to keep the remaining assets is patently unfair and
discriminatory,” Justice Roberto Ribeiro of the  Court of Final
Appeal  wrote in a 52-page judgment upholding an award of HK$2.68
million ($346,000) to the ex-wife.  The businessman, whose identity can’t be reported, sought
to reverse a 2008 Hong Kong Court of Appeal ruling that adopted
the principle of equal asset splitting. Prior to the decision,
judges in the former British colony had wider discretion on how
to distribute assets based on individual needs. A  2001 ruling in
the U.K.  required judges use an equal split as a starting point.  “There is still a discretionary aspect but the 50-50
approach means judges will have to be very careful about how
they depart from that,” said  Sharon Ser , a partner at Facey &
Co.  The plaintiff, a 47-year-old former resident of China and
housewife, was awarded one third of her former husband’s assets
in 2006. She appealed and won half in 2008.  ‘Set the Principle’  “This was the judges’ opportunity to set the principle in
Hong Kong,” said  Catherine Por , a family lawyer at Stevenson,
Wong & Co. Greater clarity on the courts’ position will make
Hong Kong a more attractive forum for divorce seekers, Por said.  The city recorded 2.43 divorces per 1,000 people in 2009,
according to Hong Kong’s Census and Statistics Department. The
U.S. had  3.4 divorces per 1,000 people  in the same year,
excluding data from six states including California and Georgia,
and England and Wales recorded 11.2 divorces per 1,000  married
people  in 2008, government data show.  “This was a good jurisdiction if you were the one with the
money,” Ser said. “In the modern world, and especially in a
time when people are more concerned with financial matters, pre-
nups will become more the norm,” she said, referring to
agreements to divide assets signed before the marriage.  The case is FACV16/2008, LKW and DD, in Hong Kong Court of
Final Appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
