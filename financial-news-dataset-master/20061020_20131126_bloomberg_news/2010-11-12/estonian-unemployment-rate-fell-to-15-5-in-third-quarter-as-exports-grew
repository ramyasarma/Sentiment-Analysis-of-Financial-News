Estonia’s  unemployment rate  dropped
to the lowest level this year in the third quarter as a seasonal
improvement in construction and demand for the country’s exports
created jobs.  Unemployment fell to 15.5 percent, matching the level in
the fourth quarter of last year, from 18.6 percent in the April-
June period, the statistics office in Tallinn said today on its
 website . The rate rose to a record 19.8 percent in the first
quarter as Estonia suffered the European Union’s second-deepest
recession.  Recovery in demand for Estonian goods from the Baltic
nation’s key Nordic trading partners boosted hiring at companies
including the local units of Zurich-based  ABB Ltd. , which makes
wind generators, and Zurich-based Enics AG, an electronics
maker. The Finance Ministry and  Hardo Pajula , an economist with
SEB AB, said the decline in jobless rate was bigger than
expected.  “The much faster-than-expected decline in unemployment was
a positive surprise,” Pajula said in an e-mailed comment. SEB
may revise its forecast for average unemployment rate this year
to “about” 17 percent from 18 percent forecast last month, he
said.  The Finance Ministry said it expects a “stable” decline
in jobless rate over the next 12 months. In August, it had
forecast a drop in average unemployment to 15.4 percent next
year and 13.6 percent in 2012.  Jobs were created mainly in construction, where employment
increased by 14,000, and in manufacturing and trade, which added
12,000 and 8,000 more workers, respectively, the statistics
office said. The share of long-term unemployed rose to 53
percent of the total, or 56,000 persons, while the number of
those having given up job search remained unchanged at 9,000.  Merko Ehitus, the largest listed Baltic builder, increased
personnel by 16 percent annually in the third quarter to 891,
compared with 847 at the end of second quarter, the Tallinn-
based company said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
