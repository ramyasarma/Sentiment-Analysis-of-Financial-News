India’s benchmark stock index
extended a decline after the nation’s industrial production
unexpectedly slowed.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd., the nation’s largest engineering
company, retreated 1.1 percent to 2,106 rupees. The Bombay Stock
Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost 0.8 percent to
20,427.59 as of 11:03 a.m. in Mumbai.  India’s factory output in September rose 4.4 percent from a
year ago, the Central Statistical Organisation said in New Delhi
today. That compares with a revised 6.9 percent pace a month
earlier and the 6.4 percent median estimate of 27 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
