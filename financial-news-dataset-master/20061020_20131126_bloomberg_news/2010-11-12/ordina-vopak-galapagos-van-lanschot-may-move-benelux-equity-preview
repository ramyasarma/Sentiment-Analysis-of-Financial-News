The Amsterdam Exchange Index
declined 1.63, or 0.5 percent, to 343.20, extending its weekly
drop to 1.1 percent. Belgium’s Bel20 Index fell 0.3 percent to
2,624.97, a third decline.  The following were among the most active stocks in Benelux
markets today. Symbols are in parentheses.  Dutch stocks:  ArcelorMittal  (MT NA), the world’s largest steelmaker, lost
2.6 percent to 25.30 euros, the biggest drop in more than two
weeks, pacing a global selloff in commodity-related companies as
investors speculated that China will raise interest rates to
rein in inflation.  Royal Vopak NV  (VPK NA) fell 5.1 percent to 34.45 euros,
the largest decline in almost two years. The world’s largest
chemical and oil storage company said third-quarter operating
profit excluding one-time items rose 10 percent to 115 million
euros ($158 million).  “We don’t want to sound overly negative, but we note again
that the quality of the earnings could be better,”  Mutlu Gundogan , an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said
in a report. Gundogan rates Vopak “hold.”  Belgian stocks:  Nyrstar NV  (NYR BB) lost 2.9 percent to 11.17 euros, the
biggest drop in almost three months. The world’s largest zinc
producer had its recommendation lowered to “hold” from “buy”
at RBS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
