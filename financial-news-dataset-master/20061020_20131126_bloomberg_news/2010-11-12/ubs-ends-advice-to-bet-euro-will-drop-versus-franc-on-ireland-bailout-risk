UBS AG ended a recommendation to
sell the euro against the Swiss franc, citing the risk a
European Union “financial aid package for Ireland could be pre-
announced some time next week and the euro may rally.”  The trade advice would have made investors a 1.5 percent
profit since it was initiated on Nov. 5,  Beat Siegenthaler , a
currency strategist in Zurich, said today in an e-mailed note.  The euro advanced 0.2 percent against the franc to 1.3355
as of 1 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
