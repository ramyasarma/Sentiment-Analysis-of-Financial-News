Guinea’s  Cellou Dalein Diallo  held a
slim lead in presidential vote counting, as the electoral
commission said analyzing complaints by the two candidates was
slowing the pace of releasing results from the Nov. 7 poll.  Diallo had 51.8 percent of the votes, compared with 48.2
percent for rival candidate  Alpha Conde , according to Bloomberg
calculations based on figures given by Pathe Dieng, the
commission’s spokesman, in  Conakry  today. He gave results for
one further electoral district, bringing to 20 the number of
areas counted. Guinea has 38 electoral districts. Votes from 13
overseas embassies are also included in the tally.  “We will give total results as soon as possible,” the
commission’s president, General Siaka Toumany Sangare, told
reporters. The agency has received about 30 complaints from the
candidates regarding alleged “irregularities” and “fraud”,
he said, without giving more details. Sangare said the
commission has until Nov. 15 to release results.  This week’s election marks the first democratic transfer of
power in the world’s top bauxite-producing country since it
gained independence from France in 1958. It comes almost two
years after the military took control following the December
2008 death of President  Lansana Conte , who ruled for 24 years.  Observers from the African Union said Nov. 8 the voting was
held in a “serene and peaceful atmosphere,” while the Economic
Community of West African States said deficiencies of electoral
materials in some areas didn’t compromise the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
