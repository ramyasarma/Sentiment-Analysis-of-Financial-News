Intel Corp. , the world’s biggest
chipmaker, will increase its quarterly dividend about 14 percent
as a pickup in personal-computer demand boosts earnings.  The payout, starting with the one to be declared next
quarter, will rise to 18 cents a share from 15.75 cents, Santa
Clara, California-based Intel said today in a statement. The
boost met the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Intel, coming off two straight years of  sales declines , is
benefiting as companies and consumers in less developed markets
buy more computers. The company, which last month forecast sales
for this quarter that may top some analysts’ estimates, ended
the third quarter with more than $20 billion in cash and short-
term investments.  The dividend increase is larger than  last year , when Intel
boosted its payout by 13 percent.  Intel climbed 32 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $21.53 in Nasdaq
Stock Market  trading  at 4 p.m. New York time. They have added
5.5 percent this year.  To boost sales growth beyond personal computers, Chief
Executive Officer  Paul Otellini  is aiming to expand into tablet
computers and mobile phones. Intel is “on track to showcase our
first production smartphones in 2011,” Otellini wrote in an e-
mail to employees last month.  Sales this quarter will increase to $11 billion to $11.8
billion, Intel said last month. Analysts estimated $11.3 billion
on average. Third-quarter net income climbed 59 percent to $2.96
billion, the fourth consecutive increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
