Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S. will
be 1.3 percent more expensive this year because of higher prices
for milk, whipping cream, pumpkin-pie mix and shells, sweet
potatoes and pre-cooked rolls, the  American Farm Bureau
Federation  said.  The average cost of the 12 items typically served during
the holiday meal for 10 people will be $43.47, up from $42.91
last year, the federation said today in a  statement . The price
of a 16-pound turkey dropped to $17.66 from $18.65.  “The change in the price of this year’s Thanksgiving
dinner is basically in line with the modest changes that we’ve
seen in the overall price level this year,” John Anderson, an
economist at the farm group, said in the statement. “At $4.35
per person, our traditional Thanksgiving feast is still a better
deal than most fast-food value meals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
