Palm oil dropped the most in almost
a month on speculation China, the biggest cooking-oil user, may
slow purchases after prices climbed to the highest level in more
than two years.  January-delivery futures shed 1.3 percent to 3,353 ringgit
($1,076) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange. The
most-active contract slumped 3.7 percent to 3,269 ringgit, the
most since Oct. 2, 2009, in intraday trading. January-delivery
soybean oil lost as much as 4.5 percent to 52.85 cents a pound
in Chicago, the most since Dec. 17.  Palm oil’s decline mirrored losses in other commodities.
Cotton, sugar and rubber futures tumbled by the daily limit in
China as gains to records were seen as excessive and on concern
the country may step up efforts to cool inflation, possibly
lowering demand. Copper and zinc also slid.  “China may slow imports of soybeans until March after
stocking up enough,” said  Ben Santoso , an analyst at DBS
Vickers Securities Singapore. “The weakness in soybean oils
will reflect in palm oil, which won’t be in great demand during
winter months” as the tropical oil clouds in cooler climes.  China’s soybean imports fell 19.6 percent to 3.73 million
tons in October from the previous month on a seasonal decline in
global supply, according to customs data released Nov. 10.  The country may begin selling stockpiled soybeans from next
week to slow gains in food prices, said  Cao Huimin , an analyst
at China Cereals & Oils Business Net, a researcher in Beijing.
The sales may total as much as 2.6 million tons, she said.  Global Supplies  Palm oil has rallied for 11 weeks, the best winning streak
since June, 2007, on concern global edible oils supplies will be
tight after the U.S. said soybean supplies may be smaller than
forecast and production fell in Malaysia. The vegetable oil
advanced 5.1 percent this week.  Output in Malaysia, the biggest palm-oil producer after
Indonesia, dropped to 14.3 million tons in the 10 months ended
Oct. 31, from 14.5 million tons, the nation’s palm oil board
said Nov. 10. Soybean inventories before next year’s harvest
will be 30 percent less than forecast last month, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said this week.  “Some correction was expected in palm oil after the one-
way rally and it’s been mostly because of the strength in the
dollar today and speculation China may take steps to control
inflation,” Santoso said. “Palm oil may rebound in the first
quarter after some correction this month and next.”  In China, palm oil for September delivery plunged 4.4
percent to 9,154 yuan ($1,378) in Dalian, the most in more than
28 months. Soybean oil for September delivery shed 3.6 percent
to 9,992 yuan a ton, the most since July 8, 2009.  CME Group Inc.’s March palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, fell as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,103.25 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
