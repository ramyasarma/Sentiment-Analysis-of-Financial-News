Broadway’s silliest, most immature
character is starring at a theater named for its ultimate
sophisticate.  Paul Reubens’s “ The Pee-wee Herman Show ” at the  Stephen
Sondheim Theatre  is a lavish production (players, puppets and
props rampaging amid David Korins’s scenery) that runs for 90
proudly idiotic minutes. It features Reubens’s frozen face and
chirpy voice dispensing antediluvian jokes and cringe-making
puns.  Typical scenes concern Pee-wee’s love affair with Chairry,
the female armchair our boy sits on, embraces and is hugged by;
Jambi, the bodiless swami’s head that lives in a box; and Pterri
the Pterodactyl, who flits about arousing Pee-wee’s yearning to
fly. The plot, such as it is, hinges on the possible wiring of
the Playhouse for Pee-wee’s computer, which turns out to be a
very bad idea indeed.  Directed by Alex Timbers (of “Bloody Bloody Andrew
Jackson”), the show offers no straight man to Pee-wee’s
silliness: humans, puppets and animated furniture are equally,
irremediably clownish.  I don’t know what is more retrograde: a 58-year-old frozen-
faced buffoon or the antique antics rehashed by the script.  About the kindest thing one can say is: It is at least a
harmless kind of idiocy.  At 124 W. 43rd St. Information: +1-212-239-6200;
