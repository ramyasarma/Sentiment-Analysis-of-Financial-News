Lewis Hamilton , who has the slimmest
chance of four drivers to win the Formula One championship in
Abu Dhabi, set the fastest time over two practice sessions today.  Hamilton posted a lap of 1 minute, 40.9 seconds on the 3.5-
mile Yas Marina circuit in the second practice session, 0.3
seconds quicker than  Sebastian Vettel  of Red Bull, according
to series website Formula1.com  Ferrari’s championship leader  Fernando Alonso  and Red
Bull’s  Mark Webber  were just behind with a time of 1 minute,
41.3 seconds.  Alonso has an eight-point lead in the standings over Webber
and 15-point advantage over Vettel. McLaren’s Hamilton is 24
points behind Alonso. A race victory is worth 25 points.  Vettel was 0.6 seconds faster than Hamilton in today’s
opening practice session. Qualifying is scheduled for tomorrow,
with the race in two days at 5 p.m. local time.  Vettel and Webber are seeking their first drivers’ title.
Alonso won the championship with Renault in 2005 and 2006, while
Hamilton was champion in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
