Xstrata Plc , in the process of
buying three iron ore projects in Mauritania through Sphere
Minerals Ltd., will invest $6 billion in the country to produce
50 million metric tons of the steelmaking ingredient a year,
Industry and Mines Minister  Mohamed Abdellahi Ould Oudaa  said.  Xstrata, based in Zug, Switzerland, plans to achieve the
production figure in the “short term,” Oudaa said in a
conference in Nouakchott, the capital.  “It’s far too early in the process to commit to actual
numbers,” Mike Bartlett, an Xstrata spokesman in London, said
today by phone. “Xstrata is committed to creating a world-class
iron ore business and clearly Mauritania will play a key part.”  Xstrata, seeking to boost access to ore supplies as prices
rise, is close to completing the $520 million purchase of Sphere
after securing acceptances from more than half of the Australian
company’s shareholders. Sphere’s projects in Mauritania include
half of the $1.65 billion Guelb el Aouj development.  “Information already in the market place suggests these
assets could produce up to 50 million tons a year,” Bartlett
said. “But again, this is aspirational at this stage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
