Russian stocks declined for a third
day after oil and metals fell amid speculation China will raise
interest rates and because of concern about the level of
European government debt.  OAO Uralkali , Russia’s second-biggest potash producer, fell
1.8 percent.  OAO Novatek , the country’s second-biggest natural
gas producer, dropped 1.2 percent. Oil producer  OAO Gazprom Neft 
lost 1.2 percent, helping to push the Micex  Index  0.6 percent
lower to 1,547.78 as of 4:17 p.m. in Moscow. The 30-stock gauge
pared losses, having fallen as much as 1.3 percent earlier.  Oil, Russia’s main export earner, retreated as much as 2.6
percent to $85.51 a barrel in New York. Copper on the London
Metal Exchange slid as much as 2.9 percent to $8,575 a metric
ton. Equities fell on signs China may raise interest rates for
the second time in two months and amid speculation the European
Union may need to intervene in Ireland’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “This period of market weakness will last until there is
some resolution to Ireland’s debt issue, even if it is a Band-
Aid solution, and either China raises its interest rate or
doesn’t by Monday,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib
Financial Corp., wrote in an e-mail today.  Copper slid $186, or 2.1 percent, to $8,644 a ton on the
London Metals Exchange. Lead, nickel, tin and zinc all declined
on the LME.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , Russia’s biggest miner,
decreased 0.5 percent to 5,897.66 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
