China Rongsheng Heavy Industries
Group Holdings Ltd. , the nation’s largest shipbuilder outside
state control, raised HK$14 billion ($1.8 billion) in a Hong
Kong initial public offering, terms for the sale show.  Rongsheng sold 1.75 billion shares at HK$8 apiece after

yuan ($242 million) this year, the prospectus said. The company
