The owners of Battersea Power
Station, the derelict  London  landmark that closed 28 years ago,
won U.K. government approval to build apartments, stores and
offices on the site and can now proceed with the 5.5 billion-
pound ($8.9 billion) project.  “This marks the final decision in the planning application
process,” project manager Treasury Holdings said in a statement
today. Building work is due to begin in 2012, the company said.  Irish millionaires Richard Barrett and John Ronan, whose
Jersey-registered  Real Estate Opportunities Plc  owns the site,
plan to build 3,400 homes and 330,000 square meters (3.5 million
square feet) of commercial space. Barrett and Ronan are trying
to raise money from investors to finance the project.  The work will take more than a decade to complete, creating
more than 15,000 jobs and providing 500 affordable homes, REO
estimates. It’s part of a regeneration plan for the Nine Elms
neighborhood covering the south bank of the  River Thames  between
central London’s Chelsea and Vauxhall bridges, an area where the
U.S. is also due to relocate its embassy in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
