The “worst” for Chinese property
stocks appears to be over, said JPMorgan Chase & Co., which said
restrictive policy measures to curb housing price growth may not
be repeated in the second half of 2011 and now is the “right
time” to enter. The brokerage said the industry has
underperformed the market this year and the trend is expected to
reverse next year, according to a report by analysts including
Lucia Kwong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
