Polish  police  captured a 50-kilogram
(110-pound) beaver after it attacked a dog in the southwestern
town of Zgorzelec, on the German border.  A local resident called for help around midnight on Nov. 8
while walking his dog, an American Staffordshire terrier, Junior
Warrant Officer Antoni Owsiak, a spokesman, said by phone today,
confirming a report in Gazeta Wyborcza.  Veterinarians tested the beaver for rabies and found it to
be “in perfect health,” before releasing it in a nearby nature
reserve, Owsiak said.  Beavers “generally” weigh 16 kilograms to 30 kilograms,
according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.  To contact the reporter on this story:
