Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.  sued
 AstraZeneca Plc  in the U.K. over claims that its European
patents for the best-selling ulcer treatment Nexium are invalid,
two years after settling a related U.S. case.  India’s biggest drugmaker also seeks a court order that it
won’t infringe the patents if it starts selling generic Nexium
in Britain, AstraZeneca said in an Oct. 29 regulatory filing.
Justice  George Mann  in the High Court in London today agreed
that documents outlining the claims and AstraZeneca’s defense in
the case should be kept secret.  “AstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will vigorously
defend and enforce, its intellectual property protecting
Nexium,”  Laura Woodin , an AstraZeneca spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail today. The lawsuit over two patents, which expire in 2014
and 2018 respectively, was filed on Sept. 30.  Generics makers are vying for a share of the market after
AstraZeneca had Nexium sales of $912 million in western Europe,
out of a worldwide total of $3.74 billion, in the first nine
months of this year. Following earlier settlements, AstraZeneca
in March sued India’s Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. to
prevent it from selling generic Nexium in the U.S. before 2014.  The earlier U.S. case against Gurgaon, India-based Ranbaxy
was settled in April 2008 in a deal that gave it the right to
sell generic Nexium in the U.S. under license from London-based
AstraZeneca beginning in 2014. AstraZeneca sued in 2005 in
federal court in New Jersey, after Ranbaxy sought U.S.
regulatory approval for generic drug.  Six U.S. Patents  Under the U.S. deal, Ranbaxy agreed AstraZeneca’s six U.S.
patents on the product were “valid and enforceable,” the
U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker said at the time. Ranbaxy also
accepted that its generic medicine would infringe four of those
patents if it were sold without a license.  AstraZeneca reached a similar deal with Israel’s Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. in January when it settled
another U.S. lawsuit over generic Nexium. U.S. sales of the drug
last year were $2.84 billion.  Krishnan Ramalingam , a Ranbaxy spokesman, had no immediate
comment when reached today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
