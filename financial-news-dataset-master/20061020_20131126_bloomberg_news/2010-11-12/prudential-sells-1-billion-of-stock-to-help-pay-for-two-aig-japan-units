Prudential Financial Inc. , the
second-biggest U.S. life insurer, sold stock at $54.50 a share,
below yesterday’s closing price, to raise about $1 billion and
help  pay for  two units from  American International Group Inc.   Prudential sold more than 18.3 million shares, according to
data compiled yesterday by Bloomberg. The insurer slipped 52
cents, or 1 percent, to $54.50 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  Prudential agreed Sept. 30 to buy AIG Star Life Insurance
Co. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Co., two Japanese businesses,
for $4.8 billion. The Newark, New Jersey-based insurer
previously said it would pay for the units with $1.7 billion of
capital and sales of $1.3 billion of equity and $1.2 billion of
debt. It  announced  Nov. 3 that it would reduce the stock and
bond sales to $1 billion each and use $2.2 billion of cash.  “Our just-announced acquisition of Star, Edison insurance
companies fulfills the criteria of a successful deal,” said
Chief Executive Officer  John Strangfeld  in a conference call
after third-quarter earnings were released. The purchase should
provide cash to “support shareholder dividends, potential
acquisitions and other activities.”  Higher Dividend  Prudential said on Nov. 9 that it will boost its annual
dividend 64 percent, to $1.15 a share, the highest since 2007.
The $4.8 billion purchase price also includes the assumption of
about $600 million in debt. Prudential has risen about 9.5
percent this year through yesterday, compared with a 16 percent
rise in the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index .  Underwriters have the option of buying an additional 2.75
million shares over 30 days, Prudential said in a statement late
yesterday. Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., UBS AG and
Barclays Plc are among firms that managed the offering.  MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer sold more than
$6 billion in stock and notes in August to help pay for its
$16.2 billion purchase of AIG’s American Life Insurance Co. AIG
is divesting assets to help repay a $182.3 billion U.S. bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
