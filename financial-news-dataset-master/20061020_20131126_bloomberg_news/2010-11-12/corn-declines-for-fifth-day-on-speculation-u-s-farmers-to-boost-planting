Corn fell for a sixth day in Chicago
and soybeans slid the most in six weeks on speculation China
will raise interest rates, curbing borrowing by buyers of crops.
Wheat also declined.  China will raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage point
before 2010 ends, HSBC Holdings Plc said today. The government
last month increased borrowing costs for the first time since
2007. Stronger Chinese demand helped soybeans to jump 24 percent
this year, and corn is up 37 percent after China’s first major
purchases of the grain from the U.S. since 2001.  “Speculation on an interest-rate hike in China soon has
also led to sharp price markdowns of agricultural commodities,”
 Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt, said in a report.  Corn for March delivery fell 10.75 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $5.6725 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The most-active contract is down 5.7 percent
this week.  Soybeans for January delivery slumped 34.5 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $13.045 a bushel. Prices dropped as much as 3.8
percent, the most since Oct. 1. The oilseed has gained 1.6
percent this week.  Wheat for March delivery fell 12.5 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $7.315 a bushel. Milling wheat for January delivery traded on
NYSE Liffe in Paris slid 1.8 percent to 217.25 euros ($298.20) a
metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
