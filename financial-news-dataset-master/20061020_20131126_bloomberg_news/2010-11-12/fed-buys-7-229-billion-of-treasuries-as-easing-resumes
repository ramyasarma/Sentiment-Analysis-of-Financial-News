The Federal Reserve began a second
round of unconventional monetary easing by buying $7.229 billion
of  Treasuries  in attempt to drive down borrowing rates to help
reduce unemployment and avert deflation.  Policy makers acquired 16 of the 24 securities maturing
from November 2014 through April 2016 that were listed on the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  website.  The acquisitions are
part of the Fed’s plan to acquire $600 billion of Treasuries
through June and reinvest maturing mortgage holdings.  The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee announced
this round of stimulus on Nov. 3 after a benchmark  interest rate 
near zero and an earlier program to buy $1.7 trillion of
securities failed to bring down an unemployment rate that’s
stuck near a 26-year high. The policy known as quantitative
easing has triggered criticism from officials in nations
including Brazil, China and Germany, who say the injection of
cash into the banking system may harm economies worldwide.  “There is some discomfort in the market right now because
the QE2 has come under such criticism by a vast array of
sources,” said  Ward McCarthy,  chief financial economist in New
York at Jefferies & Co. Inc., one of the 18 primary dealers that
trade government debt with the central bank. “Once the Fed gets
into its routine -- next week they will be in buying Treasuries
every day -- it will begin to have a positive effect on the
Treasury market.”  High-Coupon Debt  The  yield  on the 10-year Treasury note increased 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 2.75 percent at 12:35 p.m.
in New York. The yield has increased 22 basis points this week.  Two of the 16 securities the Fed purchased today carried a
interest-rate coupon of over 10 percent, including a 10.625
percent note maturing Aug. 15, 2015, and one with a 11.25
percent coupon that comes due on Fed. 15, 2015.  “Some of the securities the Fed purchased have been
floating around for a long time,” added McCarthy. “Whoever
owned them made a massive profit.”  The central bank eased a self-imposed 35 percent
individual security holdings limit, allowing for increases
“only in modest increments,” for the purchases. The Fed said
on Nov. 10 it will purchase $105 billion of debt over the next
month.  The central bank expects to reinvest $250 billion to $300
billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed debt and agency
securities into Treasuries through the end of the second half of
next year. The Fed has bought $75.845 billion of Treasuries
since it began the reinvestment program on Aug. 17.  The closing time for today’s transactions was pushed back
to 11:30 a.m. from 11 a.m. New York time because of a
“technical issue,” according to  Deborah Kilroe,  a spokeswoman
for the New York Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
