Copper may drop as investors judge
that the metal’s climb to a record level leaves prices no longer
reflecting the outlook for demand, a survey showed.  Eight of 15 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 53 percent, said the metal will fall next week.
Seven predicted higher prices. Copper for delivery in three
months was up 2.4 percent for this week at $8,865 a metric ton
at 1 p.m. yesterday on the London Metal Exchange after reaching
an all-time high of $8,966.  “All of these commodities are in unsustainable price
bubbles,” said  Donald Selkin , chief market strategist at
National Securities Corp. in New York.  LME copper’s 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of
whether a commodity is overbought or oversold, rose above 69.5
this week, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. That’s near the
level of 70 viewed by some analysts who study technical charts
as signaling a potential impending drop. The metal touched its
previous peak of $8,940 a ton in July 2008.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of Nov. 5.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
52 of the past 111 weeks, or 47 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 7  Bearish : 8  To contact the reporter on this story:
