Google Inc. , owner of the world’s
most popular Internet search site, boosted the stock grants and
bonuses of some of its executives, including Chief Financial
Officer  Patrick Pichette .  Pichette and  Nikesh Arora , head of global sales, will each
be paid $20 million in equity awards, the Mountain View,
California-based company said today in a regulatory filing.
Stock awards to executive officers will be made annually from
now on, rather than every other year, the company’s previous
practice.  Google is raising compensation as it faces more competition
for talent from rival Internet companies such as Facebook Inc.
It’s also raising performance bonuses for executives to 250
percent of base salary from 150 percent, the filing said.  Alan Eustace , senior vice president of engineering and
research, will receive a $10 million equity award, while
 Jonathan Rosenberg , senior vice president of product management,
will get a $5 million award.  Founders  Sergey Brin  and  Larry Page  and Chief Executive
Officer  Eric Schmidt  don’t participate in the executive plan and
receive an annual salary of $1 apiece.  Google shares fell $13.90, or 2.3 percent, to $603.29 at
5:20 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They have
fallen 2.7 percent this year compared with an 11 percent gain by
the Nasdaq Composite Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
