Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Imperial Oil
subsidiary wants an extension of its nine-year exploration
license in the Beaufort Sea, in Canada’s ecologically fragile
far north, the Globe & Mail reported, citing company spokesman
Pius Rolheiser.  Imperial told Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, which
licenses oil and gas exploration, that two years have been lost
while the National Energy Board works on rules for Arctic
drilling and it will apply for an extension of its lease, the
newspaper reported.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
