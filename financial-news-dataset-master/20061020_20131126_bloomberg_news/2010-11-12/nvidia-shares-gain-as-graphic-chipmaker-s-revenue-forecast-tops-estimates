Nvidia Corp. , a maker of graphics
chips, rose the most in three weeks in Nasdaq trading after
forecasting higher sales than analysts estimated, a sign that
consumer demand for personal computers is improving.  Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter will be $869.2 million
to $886.1 million, Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia said
yesterday in a statement. That compares with the $863.9 billion
average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Nvidia has released new products, helping it compete with
 Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  in the market for chips that run
add-in graphics cards in PCs. Those products are starting to
reverse market share losses, Chief Executive Officer  Jen-Hsun Huang  said in an telephone interview yesterday.  “We’re gaining it back right now,” Huang said. “We’ve
just got to go after it as hard as we can.”  Nvidia  rose 65 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $13.26 at 4 p.m.
New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has lost 29
percent this year.  Under Huang, who founded the company in 1992, Nvidia is
trying to expand the use of its graphics chips beyond plug-in
cards to mobile devices and server computers. Those efforts are
aimed at offsetting the decline in Nvidia’s chipset business,
which is shrinking as new designs by  Intel Corp.  and AMD make
the products obsolete.  The company is working with computer, phone, consumer
electronics and car makers to create tablet devices around its
chips, Huang said in the interview.  Net income  in the third quarter fell 21 percent to $84.9
million, or 15 cents a share, for the period ended Oct. 31,
compared with $107.6 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier, the
company said. Sales fell 6.6 percent to $843.9 million. Analysts
on average predicted profit of 14 cents a share on sales of
$844.1 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
