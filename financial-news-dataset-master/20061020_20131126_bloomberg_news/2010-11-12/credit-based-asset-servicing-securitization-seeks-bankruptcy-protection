A judge told Credit-Based Asset
Servicing & Securitization LLC, the bankrupt subprime mortgage
investor, to resubmit its bid to use cash collateral on an
interim basis and called for the creation of a committee to
represent unsecured creditors.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Allan Gropper  in Manhattan today
denied the company’s first request to use $50,000 to $100,000
worth of its lenders’ collateral. He said that C-Bass, as it’s
known, hadn’t shown it needed the money on an emergency basis
and that an agreement between the company and its lenders needed
to be vetted by a committee representing unsecured creditors.  “In today’s marketplace, the lenders always want to push
for more, but we’ve come to the end of the line,” Gropper told
lawyers for C-Bass. He said the concessions proposed by the
lenders, however fair they may be, shouldn’t be pushed through
court before a committee can evaluate them.  Damian S. Schaible, a lawyer for JPMorgan Chase Bank, an
agent to the lenders, told Gropper that C-Bass had received
permission to use cash collateral before the bankruptcy filing.
He proposed a new order, which he said would be submitted later
today, setting a $100,000 limit on the use of cash, and
excluding what the judge had called “bells and whistles.”  The case is In re Credit-Based Asset Servicing &
Securitization LLC, 10-16040, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
