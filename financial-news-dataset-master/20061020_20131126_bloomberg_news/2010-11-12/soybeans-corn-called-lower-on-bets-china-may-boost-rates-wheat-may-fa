What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 30 cents to 40 cents lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation that China will increase
interest rates, damping commodity demand, said  Chad Henderson , a
market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield, Wisconsin. Soybean-meal futures may open $6 to $8
lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open down
1.5 cents to 2 cents a pound.  -- Corn futures are called 8 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower on
the Chinese rate speculation, Henderson said.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as rains boost crops in the U.S. southern Great
Plains, Henderson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
