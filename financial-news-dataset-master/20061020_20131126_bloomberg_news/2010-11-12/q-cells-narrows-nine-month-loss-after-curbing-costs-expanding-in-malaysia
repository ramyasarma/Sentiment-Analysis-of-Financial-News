Q-Cells SE , the German solar-cell
maker that’s declined more than two-thirds in the stock market
this year, narrowed its nine-month loss after increasing sales
and moving more production to Malaysia to curb costs.  The net loss shrunk to 31 million euros ($42 million) from
a 932 million-euro loss a year earlier, Thalheim-based Q-Cells
reported today in a  filing . Revenue climbed 79 percent to 967
million euros. The company’s shares rose 10 percent.  Chief Executive Officer  Nedim Cen  increased output in
Malaysia to a level that exceeded Germany’s for the first time
and raised 256 million euros, more than half the company’s
market value, from stock and bond investors this month. He’s
aiming to reverse the worst share plunge among the world’s major
manufacturers of devices that turn sunlight into electricity.  “Tight cost control and management of investments and the
liquidity position will stay in the focus going forward,” Cen
said today in a statement. The company’s net working capital
increased 38 percent to 646 million euros at the quarter ended
Sept. 30 while cash fell 5.5 percent to 389 million euros.  Bond sale proceeds “will give us additional maneuvering
space in challenging market conditions,” Chief Financial
Officer  Marion Helmes  said today in a statement.  Q-Cells shares rose 27 cents to close at 2.95 euros in
Frankfurt, valuing the manufacturer at 522 million euros. The
company, which closed as high as 80.95 euros a share in December
2007, has been hurt by lower-cost competitors in Asia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
