A joint statement issued by Group of
20 nations today suggests emerging-market nations will be
allowed to restrict capital flows, potentially driving down
their currencies, UBS AG said.  “We believe there’s a grand bargain in here, whereby
everyone signs up to current-account targets in the long term,
but in the short term emerging markets are allowed to put up
capital controls,” Geoffrey Yu , a foreign-exchange strategist
in London, said in an e-mailed note. “Cut emerging-market
positions in particular. Though be careful in trading the dollar
within G-10 as diversification flows could dent greenback
upside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
