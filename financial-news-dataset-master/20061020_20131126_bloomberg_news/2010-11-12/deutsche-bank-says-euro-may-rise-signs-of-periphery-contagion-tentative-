Deutsche Bank AG foreign-exchange
strategists said the euro will overcome concern some nations in
the currency union may struggle to fund their deficits and
strengthen against the dollar by the end of the year.  “We’re cautious short term given the ongoing foreign-
exchange focus on the peripherals, but unless we see clearer
signs of contagion, we think euro-dollar will make new highs by
the end of the year,” a team led by Bilal Hafeez , global head
of foreign-exchange strategy in London, said in a report dated
yesterday.  “There are no signs of broader contagion to money markets
or financial stocks similar to the March-May 2010 Greek
experience,” the analysts wrote. “With Ireland pre-funded this
year, Portugal’s auction out of the way this week, and the
European Central Bank still present as a last-resort buyer of
peripherals, our expectation remains that markets should
normalize over the next few weeks, allowing the dollar-weakening
theme to return.”  The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3706 as of 11:07 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
