Canadian stocks  rose for the first
time in three days as U.S. retail sales and Japanese gross
domestic product increased faster than most economists forecast.  Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s fourth-biggest
insurer, rose 1.6 percent as financial companies rallied. Potash
Corp., the world’s largest fertilizer producer by market value,
dropped 1.9 percent after BHP Billiton Ltd. withdrew its $40
billion hostile bid for the company. Caterpillar dealer Finning
International Inc. advanced 5.5 percent to C$26.49 after
Caterpillar Inc. announced a $7.6 billion acquisition.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  climbed 30.73
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,779.97 as of 10:40 a.m. in
Toronto. Among S&P/TSX stocks, 151 gained, 78 declined and five
were unchanged.  “Retail sales are doing pretty well, and you sure don’t
hear ‘double-dip’ anymore,” said  David Baskin , president of
Baskin Financial Services Inc. in Toronto, which manages about
C$370 million ($367 million). “I think they would give people
optimism” about the holiday season, he said.  The S&P/TSX decreased the most in almost three months last
week as the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index
retreated for the first week since Aug. 20. Oil and copper
slipped after China reported the highest monthly inflation in
two years, sparking concerns the country may raise interest
rates.  U.S. retail sales rose 1.2 percent in October, the most in
seven months, the Commerce Department said today in Washington.
Economists had forecast a gain of 0.7 percent, according to the
median of 74 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Japanese Growth  Japan reported that its economy grew by 3.9 percent in the
third quarter. The median economist forecast was for a 2.5
percent advance.  The S&P/TSX Financials Index increased for the first time
in a week. Manulife climbed 1.6 percent to C$15.14. Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country’s fifth-largest bank,
rose 0.9 percent to C$75.82. Bank of Montreal, the No. 4 bank by
assets, gained 0.6 percent to C$58.56.  Potash Corp. fell 1.9 percent to C$138.71 after BHP, the
world’s largest mining company, ended its attempt to buy the
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, fertilizer producer. The Canadian
government said on Nov. 3 BHP’s proposed takeover would not
bring a “net benefit” to the country, a requirement for
foreign takeovers under Canadian law.  Agrium Inc., Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer,
dropped 2.3 percent to C$79.79.  Gold Shares Slip  The country’s eight largest gold producers by market value
all declined as the U.S. dollar climbed against the euro, Swiss
franc, British pound and Japanese yen. The greenback rallied a
day after  Jeffrey Lacker , the president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Richmond, said the central bank may need to tighten
monetary policy to avoid a surge in inflation.  Eldorado Gold Corp., Canada’s fifth-largest gold producer
by market value, lost 2.8 percent to C$17.43. Kinross Gold
Corp., Canada’s third-largest producer of the metal, decreased
0.7 percent to C$18.34. Silver reseller Silver Wheaton Corp.
retreated 1.1 percent to C$33.74.  Finning International advanced 5.5 percent to C$26.49 after
Caterpillar Inc. agreed to buy Bucyrus International Inc., a
maker of excavation equipment. Finning, based in Vancouver, has
soared 59 percent this year, the  most since at least 1987 .
Finning shares touched a two-year intraday high of C$26.59.  To contact the reporter on this story:
