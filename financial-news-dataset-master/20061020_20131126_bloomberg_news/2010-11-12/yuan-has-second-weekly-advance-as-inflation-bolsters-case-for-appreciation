China’s yuan was headed for a second
weekly advance, leading gains in Asia, as a pickup in inflation
bolstered the case for policy makers to heed U.S. calls for
faster appreciation.  Government data this week showed  consumer prices  jumped 4.4
percent from a year earlier in October and the trade surplus was
$27.2 billion, the highest levels since at least January 2009.
The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate for yuan
trading at 6.6239 per dollar today, the strongest since a peg
ended in July 2005, as leaders from the Group of 20 nations held
talks in Seoul to tackle currency swings and trade imbalances.  “Data is really telling us that the yuan can appreciate
faster,” said  Robert Minikin , a senior foreign-exchange
strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong. “It has been
an opportune time for China to beef up yuan appreciation with
the G-20 happening, but the question is what will happen next
week.”  The Chinese currency gained 0.4 percent this week to 6.6296
per dollar as of 10:04 a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. It retreated 0.1 percent today,
after yesterday touching 6.6173, the strongest level since
official and market exchange rates were unified in 1993.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.8 percent
to 6.4900 today in Hong Kong, poised for a 0.5 percent weekly
loss. The contracts reflect bets the currency will appreciate
2.1 percent in a year, the smallest gain projected since
September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Minikin said
he expects a strengthening of about 4 percent in the coming year.  The yuan has risen 25 percent since the start of 1999, the
fourth-best performance of 25 emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  President Barack Obama met yesterday with Chinese President
Hu Jintao at the G-20 talks, seeking to discuss global
imbalances with a country whose record $28 billion trade surplus
with the U.S. in August fueled criticism that the yuan is
undervalued. South Korean President Lee Myung Bak said today
“there has been much progress” made at the two-day summit.  -- Sonja Cheung . Editors:  James Regan ,  Ven Ram   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
