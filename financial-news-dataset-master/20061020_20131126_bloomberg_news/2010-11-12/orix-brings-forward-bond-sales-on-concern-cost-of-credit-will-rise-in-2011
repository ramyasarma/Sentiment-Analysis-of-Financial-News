Orix Corp. , Japan’s biggest non-bank
corporate borrower this year, is bringing forward bond sales
planned for next year on concern debt financing costs may rise.  “Interest rates are at the bottom and won’t go down,”
Chief Financial Officer  Haruyuki Urata  said in an interview in
his Tokyo office. Orix will move up sales originally planned for
the fiscal year starting in April because “globally there
remains uncertainty,” he said.  Orix sold 430 billion yen ($5.2 billion) of bonds this year,
more than Toyota Motor Corp., Panasonic Corp. or Sony Corp.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Tokyo-based company,
Japan’s biggest equipment lessor, was the 50th-ranked borrower
last year with 55 billion yen of notes, the data show.  Japan’s  benchmark 10-year bond  yield fell to a seven-year
low of 0.84 percent on Oct. 6 and the yen gained 13 percent
against the dollar this year as investors sought refuge amid
concern about a European debt crisis. Japan’s economic expansion
may stall in the fourth quarter as the surging yen crimps
exports and fading stimulus measures force consumers to pare
spending, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 21 economists.  The extra yield investors demand to own Japanese corporate
bonds instead of government debt fell to 29 basis points from 38
basis points this year, according to a Nomura Securities Co.
index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Founded in 1964, Orix has expanded from leasing into other
financial services, this year buying a South Korean savings bank
and a U.S. hedge fund company. It sold debt planned for this
fiscal year between April and September, and last month started
selling debt originally earmarked for fiscal 2011, Urata said.  Orix sold 20 billion yen of 3.1 percent, three-year bonds
on Nov. 25, according to Bloomberg data. The coupon for a new
issue on similar-maturity notes fell to 1.26 percent when the
company raised 10 billion yen on July 2.  Orix sold $750 million of 4.71 percent, five-year bonds
on April 21, its first U.S. dollar-denominated debt sale since
2006, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
