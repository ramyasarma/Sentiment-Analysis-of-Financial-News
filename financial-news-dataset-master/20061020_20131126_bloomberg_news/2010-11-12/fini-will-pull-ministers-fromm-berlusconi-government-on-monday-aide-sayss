Gianfranco Fini, co-founder of Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s ruling People of Liberty party,
will pull his ministers out of the government on Nov. 15 to try
to force the premier to resign, a top Fini aide said.  Berlusconi “needs to go to the head of state and tell him
that one of the pillars of his majorty no longer supports him
and resign,” Italo Bocchino, head of Fini’s new party, Future
and Liberty for Italy, in the Chamber of Deputies, said in an
interview last night on the television program “Annozero” on
state-owned RAI television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
