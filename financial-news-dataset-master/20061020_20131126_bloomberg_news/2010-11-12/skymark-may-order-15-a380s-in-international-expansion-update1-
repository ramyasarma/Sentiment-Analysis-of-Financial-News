Skymark Airlines Inc. , Japan’s
biggest low-cost carrier, said it may order as many as 15  Airbus
SAS  A380 superjumbos as it adds international flights.  The planes, which would be delivered from 2014, would fly
to cities including London, Frankfurt and New York, President
 Shinichi Nishikubo  told reporters in Tokyo today. The carrier
plans to fit the superjumbos with 394 seats, divided between
business and premium economy.  Skymark  plunged 16 percent on Nov. 9 in Tokyo trading after
first announcing plans to add A380s and challenge All Nippon
Airways Co. and Japan Airlines Corp. on overseas routes. The
carrier currently only flies scheduled domestic services using a
fleet of 15 all-economy Boeing Co. 737 planes.  The airline has signed a memorandum of understanding with
Airbus covering the purchase of four A380s, the planemaker said
in a statement today. Skymark intends to buy two of the aircraft
itself and to lease the other two, Nishikubo said.  The carrier intends for the A380s to be profitable in the
first year of operation, he said. Future destinations will
include Los Angeles, Honolulu, Melbourne and Rome, he said.  Skymark, which is listed on the start-up  Mothers section  of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, fell 1 percent to 760 yen at the close
of trading today. The airline announced its A380 fleet plans
after the market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
