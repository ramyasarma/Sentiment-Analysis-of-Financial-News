Two groups led by English Premier
League soccer teams West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur are
the final bidders for the lease of the Olympic Stadium in
London.  “We started this process to ensure the very best legacy
for the stadium, and we are now at a point where we have
selected the two strongest bids,”  Margaret Ford , chairwoman of
the Olympic Park Legacy Co., said in an e-mailed statement.  Tottenham is the lead bidder in a group which also includes
U.S.-based concert promoter AEG Worldwide and ENIC Limited,
while West Ham is a joint bidder with the London borough of
Newham.  The stadium for the 2012 Olympics is being built in
Stratford in east London. The 80,000-seat stadium may be scaled
down to a 25,000-seat mixed-use facility after the Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
