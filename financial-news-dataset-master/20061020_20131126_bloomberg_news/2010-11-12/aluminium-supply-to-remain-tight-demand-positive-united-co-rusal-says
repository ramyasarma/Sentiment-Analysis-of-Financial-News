United Co. Rusal said it expects
aluminum stocks to remain tight for the “foreseeable future,”
with premiums supported at current levels, according to a
statement from the company to the Hong Kong stock exchange
today.  Rusal estimates aluminum prices to remain at $2,300 a ton
in the fourth quarter because of “positive” underlying demand
and as the weakness in the U.S. dollar supports investment in
physical assets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
