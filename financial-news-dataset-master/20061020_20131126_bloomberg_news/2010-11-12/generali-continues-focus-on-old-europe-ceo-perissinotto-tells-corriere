Assicurazioni Generali SpA  will
continue to focus on its business in Italy, Germany and France
as governments cut spending and “reduce their role,” Chief
Executive Officer  Giovanni Perissinotto  told daily Corriere
della Sera in an interview.  The insurer is also looking at eastern Europe, India,
China, Vietnam, and Brazil, the executive said, according to the
Italian newspaper.  Italy contributes about 30 percent of the company’s
premiums, which may fall to 20 percent as Generali expands
internationally, the manager said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
