The U.K. government plans to spend
almost 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) over six years to
encourage local authorities to allow the building of new homes.  Local governments will have the council tax they raise on
new homes matched by an equivalent government contribution over
the six-year period under proposals published today, Housing
Minister  Grant Shapps  said in an e-mailed statement.  “We are ending the system where the government can tell
communities what and where to build; that top-down approach
slowed house building to a trickle,” Shapps said. “The New
Homes Bonus will ensure that those communities that go for
growth reap the benefits of development, not just the costs.”  The government will provide a contribution equivalent to
125 percent of the council tax paid on new “affordable homes”
for low earners, Shapps said. Council tax is paid by homeowners
based on the valuation of their property and goes to fund local
services.  The High Court in London ruled two days ago that the
government’s elimination of regional homebuilding targets was
unlawful.  The goals, which were set under the previous Labour
administration, were scrapped by the Conservative-led coalition
weeks after it took power in May. The lack of a transitional
policy left a “massive hole” in the planning process, the Home
Builders Federation, the industry’s main lobby group, said after
the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
