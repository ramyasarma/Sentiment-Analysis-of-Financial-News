Singapore Exchange Ltd.’s proposed
takeover of  ASX Ltd.  needs no modification, said  Malcolm Starr ,
ASX’s head of regulatory policy, responding to concerns the deal
may reduce the fairness of listings rules.  A merger of the two groups in no way undermines the
Australian government’s ability to regulate the country’s stock
market operations, Starr, executive general manager of
regulatory and public policy, told Bloomberg News in a telephone
interview today.  “The idea that an exchange business licensed by the
Australian government can be managed in a way that somehow
allows the operator to ignore the existing controls is
unfounded,” Starr said. “There is absolutely no tweaking
necessary to leave the Australian government completely in
control of regulating how someone in Australia that it licenses
conducts its business.”  The proposed merger already faces opposition from
Australian lawmakers as well as scrutiny from the  Australian
Competition & Consumer Commission  and other regulatory agencies.
The country’s Financial Services Council, which represents fund
managers, is concerned the merger may compromise listing rules,
the Age newspaper reported today.  “Fair listings rules is something that every exchange
around the world has to achieve or it won’t attract investors,”
said Starr. “All exchanges around the world are trying to raise
the bar to attract more asset managers from other regulatory
environments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
