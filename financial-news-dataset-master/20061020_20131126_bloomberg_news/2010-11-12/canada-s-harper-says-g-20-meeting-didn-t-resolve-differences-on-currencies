Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper said Group of 20 leaders failed to find an agreement on
tackling imbalances in currencies and trade, though progress was
made.  “It’s fair to say we didn’t resolve those issues here,”
Harper told reporters in Seoul following a two-day summit of
G-20 nations. “These are not going to be easy issues to
resolve, but I think we’ve got everyone talking the same
language, everyone understanding longer term what has to be
done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
