Premafin Finanziaria SpA, the
company that controls Italian insurer Fondiaria-Sai SpA,
contacted Credit Suisse Group AG and Societe Generale about
taking part in a capital increase, daily Il Sole 24 Ore
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The companies haven’t reached an accord, according to the
Italian newspaper, and some of the contacts have been “informal
talks,” Sole said.  UniCredit SpA, Premafin’s biggest lender, is still
considering whether to take part, Il Sole said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
