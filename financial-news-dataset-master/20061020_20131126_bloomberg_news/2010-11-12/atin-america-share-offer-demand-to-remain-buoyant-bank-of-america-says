Demand for Latin American share
offerings “should remain buoyant” as the Federal Reserve’s so-
called quantitative easing spurs investors to seek assets
outside the U.S., Bank of America Corp. said.  “An oversupply risk in LatAm equities is not a concern,”
analysts led by  Pedro Martins Jr . wrote in a note to clients
today.  Companies that depend on the growth of infrastructure and
domestic consumption in the region are likely to raise capital,
the analysts wrote. The integration of the exchanges in Chile,
Colombia and Peru also may lead “smaller capitalization”
companies to tap the equity market as liquidity rises, they
wrote.  Latin American companies are surpassing records for share
offerings this year. OHL Mexico SAB, a unit of Spanish
construction company Obrascon Huarte Lain SA, this week raised
9.7 billion pesos ($786.7 million) in Mexico’s biggest IPO. In
September, Brazilian state oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro SA 
held the world’s largest share sale ever, raising $70 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
