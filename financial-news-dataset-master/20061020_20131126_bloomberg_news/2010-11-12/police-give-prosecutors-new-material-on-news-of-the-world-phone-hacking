London police gave prosecutors new
information about alleged phone-hacking by journalists at  Rupert Murdoch’s  News of the World newspaper.  The U.K.’s Crown Prosecution Service “will consider the
file and advise the police in due course,” it said in a
statement today. The Metropolitan Police said in a separate
statement they handed over “new material in connection with
phone hacking.”  Police said in September they would examine new evidence
from a report by the  New York Times . That report included a
statement by former News of the World reporter Sean Hoare that
he was asked to tap phones by the paper’s former editor  Andy Coulson , now Prime Minister  David Cameron’s  communications
chief. Coulson has said he didn’t know hacking was taking place.  The News of the World rejected allegations of widespread
wrongdoing and said the story in the New York Times contained no
new credible evidence.  A spokeswoman at News Corp., which owns the U.K. paper,
declined to comment. A spokesman for Cameron’s office said he
had no immediate comment on the development.  The News of the World’s former royal reporter,  Clive Goodman , and  Glenn Mulcaire , a private investigator, were jailed
in 2007 for tapping the mobile phones of prominent people.
Coulson resigned, saying he had no knowledge of the activities.  To contact the reporter for this story:
