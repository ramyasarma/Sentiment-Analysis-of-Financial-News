Rwanda is poised to sign an
agreement to share output from the Lake Kivu region with  Vanoil
Energy Ltd.  when the Canadian explorer confirms it’s found oil.  “When they confirm oil deposits, we will then discuss and
probably sign a production-sharing agreement,”  Vincent Karega ,
Rwanda’s minister of infrastructure, said today by phone from
the capital of Kigali. “They had started the process earlier
but stopped because of unfavorable weather.”  The east African nation is seeking to develop its energy
resources to reduce its dependency on oil imports. Lake Kivu has
geographical similarities with Uganda’s Lake Albert region where
 Tullow Oil Plc , the U.K. explorer with the highest number of
African licenses, has already discovered 1 billion barrels.  Strong winds blowing in the Kivu rift valley that borders
the Democratic Republic of Congo prevented Vanoil from carrying
out studies in June, the Kigali-based New Times newspaper
reported in September. Vanoil, based in Vancouver, said on its
 website  that it’s due to conduct a seismic and magnetic survey
in the region this month.  Vanoil also holds assets in Kenya and Alberta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
