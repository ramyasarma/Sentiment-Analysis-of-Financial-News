Mark Papermaster , who oversaw  Apple
Inc. ’s mobile-device engineering until he left in August after
criticism of the iPhone’s antenna design, has joined  Cisco
Systems Inc.  as a vice president working on chips.  Papermaster is responsible for chips that go into the Nexus
7000 and Catalyst switches, products that help route network
data, said Neil Wu Becker, a spokesman for Cisco, the world’s
largest maker of networking equipment.  Papermaster, a former executive at  International Business
Machines Corp. , left Apple in August amid criticism of the
iPhone’s antenna design. The phone can lose signal strength if
held a certain way, prompting Consumer Reports magazine not to
recommend the device -- the first time it hasn’t endorsed an
iPhone model.  Papermaster faced an earlier controversy when he was hired
at Apple. The move prompted a legal fight with IBM, who said he
violated an agreement not to work for a competitor within a year
of leaving. The dispute was resolved in January 2009.  Switches are Cisco’s biggest source of revenue, accounting
for 33 percent of  sales  last quarter, or $3.61 billion. Earlier
this week, the company forecast sales and profit that fell short
of analysts’ estimates. The outlook triggered the biggest
decline in the stock price since 1994.  Cisco, based in San Jose, California, fell 37 cents to
$20.15 in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading  today. The shares have
tumbled 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
