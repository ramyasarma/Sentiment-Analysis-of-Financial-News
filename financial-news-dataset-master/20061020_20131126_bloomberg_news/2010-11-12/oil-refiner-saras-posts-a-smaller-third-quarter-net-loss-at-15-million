Saras SpA, owner of the largest oil
refinery in the Mediterranean, third quarter net loss shrunk to
11 million euros from 49.6 million euros a year earlier,
according to a statement distributed by the Milan
exchange.  Excluding the changing value of inventories, the Italian
company reported a net loss of 13 million euros. That
compares with a 11 million-euro loss forecast from four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
