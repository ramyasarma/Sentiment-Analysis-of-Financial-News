Roddy White  scored on a 33-yard pass
from  Matt Ryan  with 20 seconds to play as the Atlanta Falcons
beat the Baltimore Ravens 26-21 to become the first National
Football League team to log seven wins this season.  White scored his second touchdown of the fourth quarter 45
seconds after the Ravens took the lead for the only time in the
game. Baltimore scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to
overcome a 20-7 deficit and led 21-20 with 1:05 to play.  “If you like football, like intense football, that was it,”
Falcons coach  Mike Smith  told reporters. “That might have been
the most intense game I’ve ever been involved with at any
level of football.”  After a scoreless first quarter, Atlanta opened a 10-0 lead
at halftime through a  Jason Snelling  touchdown and  Matt Bryant 
field goal. The Falcons were 13-0 ahead before  Anquan Boldin 
made it 13-7 at the end of the third quarter.  White extended Atlanta’s lead to 20-7 with 11:34 to play
and the score remained unchanged until  Derrick Mason  collected a
6-yard scoring pass from Ravens quarterback  Joe Flacco  with 5:42
remaining.  Todd Heap  then put Baltimore ahead 21-20 on a 9-yard
touchdown pass from Flacco 4 minutes, 37 seconds later.  On Atlanta’s final drive,  Michael Jenkins  controlled a 24-
yard pass from Ryan with his fingertips on a 3rd-and-10 play.
Ryan found White for the decisive score five plays later.  The Falcons, undefeated in five games at home this season,
improved to a league-best 7-2 record while the Ravens fell to 6-
3.  White caught 12 passes for 138 yards for the Falcons,
while Ryan completed 34 of 50 attempts for 316 yards.  “It was an exciting playoff atmosphere,” Ravens coach
 John Harbaugh  told reporters. “I like the way our guys fought
back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
