India’s rupee this week fell the
most in almost six months on concerns record overseas inflows in
the stock market this year may wane after the nation’s
industrial production grew at the slowest pace in 16 months.  Output  at factories, utilities and mines rose 4.4 percent
in September from a revised 6.9 percent increase a month
earlier, the statistics office said today. The median estimate
of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 6.4
percent gain.  “A slowdown in inflows is definitely likely to happen,”
said  Navin Raghuvanshi , a Mumbai-based foreign-exchange trader
at Development Credit Bank.  The local currency declined 1.1 percent to 44.8050 at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, the worst weekly loss since May, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 44.8625, the weakest
level since Sept. 29.  The rupee has gained 3.96 percent this year as overseas
investors pumped  $28.5 billion  into Indian equities, driving the
benchmark  Sensex  index to a record high last week. The index
dropped the most in five months today.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.43 in
three months, compared with expectations of 44.97 yesterday.
