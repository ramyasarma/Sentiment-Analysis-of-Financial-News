Korea Electric Power Corp. , South
Korea’s biggest electricity producer, said it ended discussions
with  Berkeley Resources Ltd.  on buying a stake in the Australian
uranium explorer’s Salamanca project.  Korea Electric “has no intention to pursue any further
discussions with Berkeley,” the Seoul-based state-run power
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Berkeley said on Oct. 29 it’s in talks with OAO Severstal
about an offer from the Russian steelmaker valuing its shares at
A$2 ($1.94) apiece and recommended shareholders accept the
offer. Should Severstal decide against the bid, Berkeley will
resume talks with other potential investors that may include
Korea Electric, it said.  Korea Electric “hasn’t provided Berkeley with any
consent,” the South Korean company said today.  Berkeley signed a preliminary agreement with Korea Electric
on Aug. 10 to finance and develop the Salamanca uranium project
in Spain. Korea Electric was negotiating to buy a 35 percent
stake in the project, according to the Korean company. Berkeley
is due to start mining by late 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
