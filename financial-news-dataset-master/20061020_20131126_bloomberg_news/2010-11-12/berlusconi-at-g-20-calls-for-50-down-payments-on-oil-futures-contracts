Investors buying oil futures should
have to put down half the cost of the contract to damp swings in
prices, Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  told Group of
20 leaders.  “The price of a barrel of oil, which matters to all our
countries, has been governed solely by financial speculation,”
he said at the G-20 summit, according to a text presented by his
delegation. “It is very necessary and urgent that the countries
of the G-20 proceed to create norms that outlaw this sort of
financial speculation, that for instance they outlaw futures or
force those that buy oil for forward delivery to commit to down
payments that go from 50 percent and up.”  The final G-20 communique made no such recommendations,
simply calling for “further work on regulation and supervision
of commodity derivative markets” and asking a task force to
deliver a report in April.  Unlike other European leaders, Berlusconi and his finance
minister,  Giulio Tremonti , left Seoul without meeting the press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
