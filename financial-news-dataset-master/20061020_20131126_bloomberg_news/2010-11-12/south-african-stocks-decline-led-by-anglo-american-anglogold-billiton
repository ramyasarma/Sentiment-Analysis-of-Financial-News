South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  gained 132.73, or 0.4 percent, to 31,692.80, the
highest since June 2008, at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.
The move extended the measure’s increase this week to 0.8
percent, the 11th straight week of advances.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), Africa’s biggest producer
of the precious metal, lost 9 rand, or 2.5 percent, to 348 rand,
the second decline in three days. Gold slipped as much as 2.2
percent to $1,378.30 an ounce. Gold futures fell, heading for a
weekly loss, on speculation that China will raise interest rates
to cool the economy, eroding demand for commodities.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, dropped 1.77 rand, or 0.7 percent, to 265.59 rand.
Copper lost as much as 2.9 percent to $8,576 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange. Lead, nickel and tin all retreated.  Coal of Africa Ltd.  (CZA SJ), a producer of the fuel in
South Africa, surged the most in two months, climbing 86 cents,
or 11 percent, to 8.70 rand. Coal of Africa said a so-called
pre-compliance notice issued last month to its Mooiplaats
project unit had been withdrawn after a meeting with
environmental regulators.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA  (CFR SJ), the world’s largest
jewelry maker, gained for the second consecutive day, advancing
1.64 rand, or 4.5 percent, to 38.19 rand. Net income rose 88
percent to 646 million euros ($879 million) in the six months
ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier, the Geneva-based company
said on its website today.  Firestone Energy Ltd.  (FSE SJ), an Australian coal mining
company, gained 1 cent, or 4.2 percent, to 25 cents, the most
since Nov. 3. The company said it has completed a definitive
feasibility study at its Sekoko joint venture and expects to
sign an offtake agreement for its saleable coal by December.  FirstRand Ltd.  (FSR SJ), South Africa’s second-largest
financial services company, advanced 57 cents, or 2.6 percent,
to 22.53 rand, its highest since November 2007. FirstRand-owned
Momentum Group’s proposed merger with insurer Metropolitan
Holdings Ltd. has been approved by Metropolitan’s shareholders,
the latter said in a regulatory filing. FirstRand will also spin
off its shareholding in Momentum to shareholders.  Pioneer Food Group Ltd.  (PFG SJ), a producer of bread and
other foods, snapped two days of increases, losing 60 cents, or
1.2 percent, to 50.40 rand. The company said fiscal full-year
earnings a share probably fell 55 percent to 62 percent in the
year ended September, less than an earlier estimate, following
an antitrust fine.  Standard Bank Group Ltd.  (SBK SJ), Africa’s largest lender,
increased 1.97 rand, or 1.9 percent, to 105.18 rand. The bank
was ordered by a Johannesburg Court to consult with the Sasbo
labor union twice before Dec. 1 to find ways to reduce job cuts
at the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
