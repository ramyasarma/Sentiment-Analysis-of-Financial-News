Trading of bearish STR Holdings Inc.
options surged  to a record  last week before the world’s largest
supplier of protective coatings for solar power panels plunged
the most ever today following quarterly results.  Trading of puts soared to 5,366 contracts on Nov. 8. That’s
127 times the average during the prior four weeks, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares, which reached a record
$27.68 the same day, plunged 18 percent to $20.21 as of 4 p.m.
in New York today for the biggest loss since their initial
public offering a year ago. Prices for put options, which give
the right to sell the stock at a set price and date,  gained  as
much as 253 percent today.  “This is highly coincidental at best, and is foul play at
worst,” said Ophir Gottlieb, head of client services at  Livevol 
Inc., a San Francisco-based provider of options market
analytics. “I tend to lean to the latter.”  Third-quarter profit excluding some items was 39 cents a
share, the company said today in a statement. That was below the
40-cent average of four analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
The company’s full-year adjusted earnings forecast of $1.47 to
$1.51 a share also missed the $1.52 average analyst estimate.
STR raised the lower end of the forecast to $1.47 a share from a
low of $1.35.  ‘Very Proud’  “We are very proud of our performance this quarter,”
 Dennis Jilot , chief executive officer of the Enfield,
Connecticut-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. “We
are enthusiastic about growth prospects for the industry.”  Before today, the shares had posted a 56 percent gain in
2010, almost triple the 20 percent gain for energy companies in
the Russell 2000 Index. STR was up 145 percent since its  IPO .  Short selling  in STR increased to 20 percent of outstanding
shares on Nov. 8, the most since it went public and about four-
times the average level, according to data compiled by Data
Explorers, a New York-based research firm. Short sellers profit
from the decline in share prices by selling borrowed securities
and later replacing them with shares bought at lower levels.  Today’s most-active STR options were November $25 puts,
which more than doubled to $3.89 and accounted for about a
quarter of all bearish trades. The November $22.50 puts jumped
253 percent to $3 for today’s biggest gain among STR options.  Open interest for STR put options more than  quadrupled  to
6,195 existing contracts after the record number of puts changed
hands on Nov. 8.  Open Interest  The December $25 puts had the biggest increase in open
interest over the past week, jumping to 2,181 from 102,
Bloomberg data show. November $25 puts had the second-biggest
gain, expanding to 2,295 contracts from 305. Each option is
linked to 100 shares.  “An earnings release is often a catalyst for options
volume,” said  Steve Sosnick , equity risk manager at Timber Hill
LLC, the market-making unit of  Interactive Brokers Group Inc. 
“Everyone knows there is a potentially significant event
occurring on a specific date, so it’s not unusual to see
increased speculation in the options trading on the prior
days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
