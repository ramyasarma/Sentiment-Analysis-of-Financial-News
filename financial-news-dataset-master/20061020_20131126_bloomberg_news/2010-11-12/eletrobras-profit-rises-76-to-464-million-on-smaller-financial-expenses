Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA,
Latin America’s largest utility, said third-quarter profit
surged 76 percent after the company had a smaller financial
expense tied to sales from its biggest hydropower dam.  Net income climbed to 799.8 million reais ($464.4 million),
or 0.7 reais a share, from 453.8 million reais, or 0.4 reais, a
year earlier, the company known as Eletrobras said today in a
regulatory filing. The Rio de Janeiro-based utility was  forecast 
to post per-share profit of 63 centavos on an adjusted basis,
the average estimate of four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  A year earlier, Eletrobras booked a 1.59 billion-real
financial expense after the real rallied 11 percent against the
dollar in the quarter, paring the value of dollar-denominated
receivables from Itaipu, the world’s second-largest hydropower
station. This year, the real appreciated at a slower pace,
leading to a 325.5 million-real financial charge.  Eletrobras declined 22 centavos, or 0.8 percent, to 26.48
reais as of the 6:06 p.m. close in Sao Paulo trading. The stock
has lost 17 percent this year, compared with a 2.6 percent gain
for Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  Results were released after the end of regular trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
