United Nations envoys at a Montreal
Protocol meeting in Bangkok this week agreed to seek
alternatives to climate-harming gases that harm the climate,
according to Fionnuala Walravens, a campaigner for the London-
based Environmental Investigation Agency.  “We didn’t get any agreement on hydrofluorocarbon-23 or
the wider HFC issue in the end but there was a declaration
signed by 91 countries” to seek alternatives, she said by e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
