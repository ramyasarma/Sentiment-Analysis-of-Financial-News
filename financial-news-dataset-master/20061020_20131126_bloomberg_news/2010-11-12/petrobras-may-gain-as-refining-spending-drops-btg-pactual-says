Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, may gain as lower refining
investment tempers “unappealing” third-quarter earnings, Banco
BTG Pactual SA said.  The prospect of higher spending on refining operations has
been “one of the greatest sources of investor disappointment,”
analysts including  Gustavo Gattass  wrote in a note to clients
today. While the stock may suffer on lower-than-expected net
income, the company may assuage profitability concerns by
signaling increased production potential and “a more cautious
message on refining,” he wrote.  “In spite of the uninspiring earnings figure, there was a
very bright point of light in the results,” Gattass wrote.
“Key now is to see how management behaves in Petrobras’s
earnings call. A positive message could make for a rally.”  Petrobras said yesterday in a statement that net income
rose to 8.57 billion reais ($4.98 billion), or 97 centavos a
share, from 7.94 billion reais in the year-earlier period.  “In general, almost every variable that we look at came in
marginally worse,” BTG’s Gattass wrote. “Petrobras’s stock is
likely to trade down on the results. A more cautious message on
refining could go a long way.”  BTG rates the stock “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
