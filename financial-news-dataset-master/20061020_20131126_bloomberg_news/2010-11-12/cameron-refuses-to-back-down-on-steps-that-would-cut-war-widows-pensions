Prime Minister  David Cameron  will
not back down on proposed changes to pensions for war widows,
his spokeswoman said, citing the need for the U.K. to keep a
tight rein on public spending.  In a letter to The Times of London newspaper today, the
chairman of  The Forces Pension Society , Vice-Admiral Michael
Moore, said rule changes to pensions mean war widows and injured
service personnel will lose hundreds of thousands of pounds
during the course of their lives.  “There’s an issue of cost here and the decision has been
made,” Cameron’s spokeswoman,  Vickie Sheriff , told reporters in
London. The premier “has the utmost regard for the armed forces
and their families, but cost decisions have to be made.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
