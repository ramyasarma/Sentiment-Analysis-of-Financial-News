Spain’s underlying inflation rate
held steady for the first time in six months in October after
the recovery from an almost two-year recession stalled.  Core consumer prices , which exclude energy and fresh food,
gained 1.1 percent from a year earlier, matching the 1.1 percent
increase in September, the  National Statistics Institute  in
Madrid said today. The headline rate, based on European Union
calculations, was 2.3 percent, above an initial estimate of 2.2
percent published on Oct. 29.  Spain’s  economy  stagnated in the third quarter as budget
cuts including public wage reductions and a pension freeze
undermined the recovery. As part of the plan to reduce the
deficit by half in two years, the Socialist government also
increased value-added tax to 18 percent from 16 percent on July
1, underpinning inflation even as  retail sales  declined in the
three months through September.  As households rein in spending to pay off debt accumulated
during a 10-year housing boom, Spain’s economy will contract 0.3
percent in 2010, while the euro area as a whole and the U.S.
expand, according to the International Monetary Fund.  The government also forecasts a 0.3 percent contraction. It
expects the economy to grow 1.3 percent next year, less than a
previous forecast of 1.8 percent, because of the impact of
austerity measures adopted in May as contagion from Greece’s
fiscal crisis spread through the southern euro region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
