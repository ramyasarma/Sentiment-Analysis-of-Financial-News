India’s benchmark stock index
dropped the most in five months as growth in the nation’s
industrial production unexpectedly slowed to a 16-month low.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. , the largest maker of sport-
utility vehicles and tractors, declined the most since May.
 Output  at factories, utilities and mines rose 4.4 percent in
September after a revised 6.9 percent increase a month earlier,
the statistics office said today. The median estimate of 27
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 6.4 percent
gain.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer,
slid as metal prices slumped on speculation China, the biggest
consumer, may attempt to rein in inflation by raising interest
rates.  “The numbers have clearly disappointed,” said  Aneesh Srivastava , the Mumbai-based chief investment officer at IDBI
Federal Life Insurance Co., who manages about $325 million. “We
will be a little conservative and cautious in our investing. We
will not increase our exposure to the capital goods sector.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
lost 432.20, or 2.1 percent, to 20,156.89, as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, completing its steepest one-day slide since
June 1. The gauge declined 4 percent this week, the most since
the five-days ended May 7. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the
National Stock Exchange dropped 2 percent to 6,071.65. The  BSE
200 Index  retreated 2.1 percent to 2,562.61.  Mahindra, Hindalco  Stocks on the Sensex are valued at  19.2 times  earnings
after jumping 15 percent this year. The gauge is the best
performer and the most expensive among the ten biggest markets
in the world.  Mahindra & Mahindra plunged 5 percent to 773.15 rupees, its
biggest drop since May 19.  Tata Motors Ltd. , the biggest
truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, fell 2.3 percent to
1,246.25 rupees, its lowest close since Nov. 5.  Hindalco sank 4.6 percent to 223.1 rupees, its steepest
drop since June 8.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the No. 1
copper and zinc producer, slumped 2.3 percent to 181.95 rupees.
 Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest producer of the alloy, slid 3.8
percent to 606.95 rupees.  Commodities tumbled today, with copper falling from a
record and oil slipping from a two-year high, on speculation
China may attempt to rein in inflation by raising interest
rates, curbing demand in the world’s biggest consumer of metals
and energy.  DLF, Bharti  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  dropped the most in more than
two months and completing its biggest weekly loss in three
months.  DLF Ltd. , the biggest developer, plunged 5.6 percent to
327.2 rupees, its biggest drop since June 7. The shares were cut
to “underperform” from “neutral” by  Anand Agarwal  and
 Abhishek Bansal , analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG, who said
“disappointment” on volumes and cash flow will continue after
“weak” second-quarter results.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. , the largest mobile-phone operator,
retreated for a third day after profit dropped, slumping 3.5
percent to 305.55 rupees, its lowest close since July 22.
 Reliance Communications Ltd. , the second-largest mobile-phone
operator, fell 3.5 percent to 169.9 rupees.  ‘Weak Sentiment’  State Bank of India  sank 4.7 percent to 3,026.8 rupees, its
sharpest drop since Jan. 27. The nation’s largest lender’s
rating was lowered by the Reserve Bank of India after the
regulator inspected accounts for the year through March 2009,
the Mint reported, without saying where it got the information.
S. S. Ranjan, chief financial officer of State Bank, didn’t
immediately respond to calls to his cell phone.  “Investor sentiment is weak,” said  Kishor Ostwal ,
managing director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a publicly
traded equities research provider in Mumbai. “Some of the
results have disappointed. Cues from other Asian markets have
not helped either.”  Overseas  investors  bought a net  1.08 billion rupees  of
Indian stocks on Nov. 10, taking this year’s record flows to 1.3
trillion rupees, according to data on the  website  of the
Securities and Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
