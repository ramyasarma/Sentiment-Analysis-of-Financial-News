Ireland’s gross funding need for
2011 will be 23.5 billion euros ($32 billion), falling to 18.6
billion euros in 2014, the nation’s debt agency said.  The funding requirement includes 3.1 billion euros of
banks’ promisory notes, the National Treasury Management Agency
said in a presentation on its  website  dated yesterday. The
funding need will be 20.7 billion euros in 2012 and 18.9 billion
euros in 2013, according to the presentation.  While Ireland is fully funded until the middle of next
year, the  extra yield  investors demand to hold Irish 10-year
government bonds rather than German bunds reached a record
yesterday, at 652 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
