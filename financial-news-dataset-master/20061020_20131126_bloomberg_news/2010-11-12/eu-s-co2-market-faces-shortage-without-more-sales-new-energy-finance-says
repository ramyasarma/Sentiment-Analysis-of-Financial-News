The European Union carbon market
will have a shortage of 190 million metric tons of allowances in
2011 after the regulator said it probably won’t auction permits
for phase three next year, said an analyst at Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  The market will be 80 million tons short in 2012, even
after the sale of 300 million tons from a reserve to spur clean-
energy projects, said Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst at New
Energy Finance in London.  New Energy Finance estimated the European Commission, the
Brussels regulator, may sell an additional 100 million tons in
so-called “early auctions” in 2012, taking the total phase-
three sales to 400 million tons before Dec. 31, 2012, he said
today. An earlier New Energy Finance forecast was for 500
million tons, he said.  The third phase of the market, the world’s largest
greenhouse-gas-reduction program by trading volume, runs for the
eight years starting 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
