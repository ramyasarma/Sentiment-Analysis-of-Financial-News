Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index slid 1.2 percent, the most since Oct. 19, as Asian stocks
tumbled on speculation that China will increase interest rates
to curb inflation.  The December contract sank to 1,196.80 at 4:37 p.m. in Hong
Kong.  The index declined 0.4 percent yesterday after Cisco
Systems and Walt Disney Co. missed analyst estimates and concern
over Europe’s debt crisis intensified.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
