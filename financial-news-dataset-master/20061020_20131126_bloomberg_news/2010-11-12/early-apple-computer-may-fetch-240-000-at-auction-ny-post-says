One of the original Apple Corp.
computers assembled by Steve Jobs and shipped from his parents’
garage may fetch $240,000 when it is auctioned by Christie’s
International Plc in London on Nov. 23, the New York Post
reported.  The Apple-1, which sold for $666.66 in 1976, contained 
8 kilobytes of memory and the buyer had to provide his own
keyboard, casing, screen and power supply.  The example being auctioned, believed to be one of 
only 200 made, comes with original packaging and instructions, 
as well as a signed letter by Jobs, the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
