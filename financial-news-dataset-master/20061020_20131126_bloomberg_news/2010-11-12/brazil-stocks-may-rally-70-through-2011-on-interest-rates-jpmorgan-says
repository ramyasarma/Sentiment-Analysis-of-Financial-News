Brazil’s stock  market  may surge as
much as 70 percent to a record by the end of 2011 as low
interest rates worldwide and “reasonable” valuations lure
investors, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The nation’s benchmark  Bovespa Index  may climb to 122,000
next year in JPMorgan’s “positive” scenario that assumes
“risk-free” interest rates remain low,  Ben Laidler , a
strategist for the bank, wrote in a report today. The rally may
be driven by a pickup in foreign inflows, along with the removal
of “overhangs” including the world’s largest share sale by
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA  in September and last month’s
presidential election, Laidler wrote.  The Bovespa has climbed 3.8 percent this year to 71,195.16
yesterday, trailing a 14 percent gain in the  MSCI Emerging
Markets Index . Laidler advised holding “overweight” positions
in Brazilian stocks relative to the country’s weighting in the
MSCI EM Latin America Index of regional shares and said
investors should focus on companies that rely on domestic demand
such as financial firms and homebuilders.  “Macro fundamentals are robust,” Laidler wrote. Credit
conditions are very supportive and “valuations are not
stretched,” he said.  The Bovespa may fall 14 percent in JPMorgan’s “cautious”
scenario that assumes earnings decline, according to the report.
 The MSCI EM Latin America Index  of regional shares has an
“upside” of 53 percent through 2011 and a potential
“downside” of 14 percent, Laidler wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
