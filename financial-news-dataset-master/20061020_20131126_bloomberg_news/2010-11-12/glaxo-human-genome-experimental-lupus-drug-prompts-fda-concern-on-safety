GlaxoSmithKline Plc  and  Human Genome
Sciences Inc. ’s experimental lupus drug Benlysta may not be
safe, according to U.S. regulators weighing approval of the
first new treatment for the autoimmune disorder in more than 50
years. Human Genome shares plunged 11 percent.  Benlysta ’s risks of suicide, infection and cancer were
greater than those in patients taking a placebo in clinical
trials, Food and Drug Administration staff said today in a
preliminary review on the agency’s website. Data showing the
drug was effective lacked “robustness,” the agency staff said.  Outside advisers to the FDA will meet Nov. 16 to assess the
medicine’s effectiveness and safety, and recommend whether it
should be approved for sale. Benlysta would be the first
treatment approved by the FDA since 1958 for lupus, a chronic
condition that causes the immune system to attack healthy cells
and affects about 5 million people worldwide.  While high doses of Benlysta met primary goals of two
trials, there was a “lack of demonstrated efficacy” in black
patients in the U.S. and an “inconsistent efficacy trend across
different geographical regions of the world,” the agency staff
said.  The FDA’s recognition of an unmet medical need for more
lupus therapies may outweigh agency staff reviewers’ safety and
efficacy concerns,  Christopher J. Raymond , an analyst with
Robert W. Baird & Co. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  ‘Benign Safety Profile’  “If there’s one surprise, it’s that the FDA seems a little
more concerned about the risk-benefit profile” than investors
may have expected, said Raymond, who has an “outperform”
rating on Human Genome. “Still, the drug has a relatively
benign safety profile” and the advisory panel review of the
drug “ought to go smoothly,” he said.  Human Genome, based in Rockville, Maryland, lost $2.88, or
11 percent, to $23.60 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading, the biggest single-day decline about
19 months. Glaxo’s American depositary receipts fell 13 cents,
or less than 1 percent, to $39.62 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Each receipt equals two ordinary shares of
London-based Glaxo.  The companies expect a decision on approval by Dec. 9, and
if the drug is cleared, sales may surpass $2.1 billion by 2014,
according to the average  estimate  of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The concerns raised by FDA staff are part of a report that
has positive overall findings, said  Michael Yee , an analyst at
RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco.  “None of it is particularly surprising,” Yee said of the
report today in a telephone interview. The FDA may approve the
drug without calling for additional trials, he said.  Fatal Disease  About 1.5 million Americans have lupus, which claimed the
lives of novelist Flannery O’Connor and CBS television reporter
Charles Kuralt. It’s most common in women ages 15 to 45 and
three times more prevalent in black women than white women,
according to the  Department of Health and Human Services .  Benlysta inhibits the production of antibodies that attack
healthy cells in lupus patients.  Lupus symptoms range from mild to life-threatening,
complicating the development of drugs and clinical trials, said
Bonnie Bermas, director of the  Brigham & Women’s Hospital Lupus
Center  in Boston.  Roche Holding AG and  Biogen Idec Inc. ’s Rituxan, approved
for rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
failed a late-stage lupus trial last year. Other drugs that have
fallen short include  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ’s
Edratide, Genelabs Technologies Inc.’s Prestara and Riquent,
developed by  La Jolla Pharmaceutical Co.  and  BioMarin
Pharmaceutical Inc.   Six-Month Review  The FDA is considering Benlysta based on a six-month
priority review. While the agency typically takes at least 10
months to rule on drug applications, it grants  priority reviews 
to therapies that may provide major advances in treatment.  Benlysta, if approved, would be the first drug developed
specifically for lupus, said  Sandra Raymond , president of the
Washington-based Lupus Foundation of America. The steroid
prednisone and some antimalarial drugs were already approved for
different conditions when the FDA cleared them for use in lupus
patients more than 50 years ago.  The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide and Roche’s
CellCept, an immunosuppressant used in organ-transplant
patients, are among medications commonly prescribed for lupus
patients without FDA approval. While FDA rules allow doctors to
prescribe drugs for unapproved purposes, companies can’t market
the treatments for those so-called off-label uses.  Existing Treatments  The long-term use of existing lupus treatments can have
debilitating side effects that, for many patients, are worse
than the disease itself, Sandra Raymond said, citing stroke,
heart attacks, bone loss, hypertension, infertility and
infections.  Benlysta may not work for all lupus patients, Brigham &
Women’s Bermas said. Candidates may include people who have
failed previous treatments or require high doses of  prednisone 
to control their symptoms and want to lower the amount to
prevent side effects, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
