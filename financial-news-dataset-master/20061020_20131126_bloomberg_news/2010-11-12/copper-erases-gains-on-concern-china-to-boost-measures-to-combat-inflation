Copper declined, trimming a second
weekly advance, on renewed concern that China may step up
measures to further tighten its economic policy after inflation
accelerated to a two-year high last month.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to $8,780 a metric ton, and
traded at $8,791 a ton by 9:09 a.m. Singapore time, up 1.6
percent this week. The contract rose as much as 0.5 percent
earlier.  February-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost as much as 3.7 percent to 66,630 yuan a ton, before trading
at 67,400 yuan, 0.5 percent higher this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
