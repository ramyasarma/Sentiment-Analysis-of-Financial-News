Disco Corp. , Japan’s biggest maker
of cutting tools for electronic equipment, fell the most in two
years after cutting its full-year net forecast by 25 percent on
sluggish investment in the semiconductor market.  The stock closed 14 percent lower at 4,510 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the largest one-day decline since Oct. 24, 2008.
It earlier  fell  as much as 16 percent, its biggest intraday drop
since listing on the bourse in December 1999.  Net income was 6.39 billion yen ($78 million) for the six
months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 95 million yen a
year earlier, the company said yesterday in a statement to the
exchange after markets closed. Disco cut its full-year profit
forecast to 9.5 billion yen from 12.6 billion yen.  “This comes as a negative surprise,”  Hisashi Moriyama , a
Tokyo-based analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a report
dated today. He cited a slowdown of the European and U.S.
economies and stiffer competition in the semiconductor dicer
blades market for the downgrade.  Moriyama lowered Disco to “neutral” from “overweight”,
a rating he had maintained since Aug. 11 last year, and cut the
company’s nine-month share price estimate to 6,000 yen from
6,500 yen.  Tokyo-based Disco also cut its full-year operating profit
forecast 23 percent to 14.5 billion yen, and its sales forecast
by 4 percent to 98 billion yen.  Disco shares have fallen 22 percent this year, compared
with a 6.7 percent decline in Japan’s benchmark Topix index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
