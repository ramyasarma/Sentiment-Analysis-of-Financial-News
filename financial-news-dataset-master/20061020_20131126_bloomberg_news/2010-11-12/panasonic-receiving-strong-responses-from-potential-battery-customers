Panasonic Corp.  is receiving
“strong responses” from automakers as it seeks new buyers for
batteries to be used in electric cars, a company official said.  “Automakers are studying various batteries including their
prices. That’s welcome to us, as we believe we can win,”  Naoto Noguchi , president of Panasonic’s battery unit, said in an
interview yesterday at the company’s headquarters in Osaka.
“We’re getting strong responses,” he said, declining to say if
the company has won new customers.  Panasonic, the world’s largest maker of rechargeable
batteries, said last week it bought a $30 million stake in U.S.
battery-car maker  Tesla Motors Inc. , tightening its supply
relationship with the automaker. Panasonic aims to triple sales
of lithium-ion cells to 1 trillion yen ($12 billion) in the year
ending March 2016 from about 324 billion yen last fiscal year,
Noguchi said in August.  Panasonic  fell  0.2 percent to 1,195 yen as of 9:26 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, extending its loss this year to 9.8 percent.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average has dropped 6.9
percent since January.  The Japanese electronics maker will produce lithium-ion
batteries for electric vehicles mainly at its new plant opened
in Osaka earlier this year, Noguchi said. Panasonic plans to
lower production costs and raise the capacity of the batteries,
he said.  The new plant started manufacturing 10 million cells a
month in April and may increase production to 25 million when
demand rises, the company said in March.  Panasonic, which vaulted atop the rechargeable-battery
industry with its purchase of Sanyo Electric Co., was in talks
with about 20 automakers in the U.S., Europe, China, India and
other markets to supply batteries, Noguchi said three months ago.  Panasonic and Tesla agreed in January to jointly develop
next-generation lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. While
Panasonic is Tesla’s “preferred” battery cell supplier, the
agreement doesn’t prevent the U.S. company from also using cells
from other makers, according to the carmaker.  The company said in January it would spend 300 billion yen
over three years on energy-related products such as solar panels,
fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries. The maker of Viera
television sets is expecting higher  revenue  growth in batteries
than its main TV operation for the years to 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
