Namib Poultry, a unit of Namib
Mills, Namibia’s biggest miller, plans to invest 500 million
Namibian dollars ($72 million) to build a poultry plant near the
capital, Windhoek.  The plant is expected to slaughter 250,000 broilers a week,
Gys White, general manager of Namib Poultry, said in an e-mailed
reply to questions.  “Poultry broiler processing has been identified because no
broilers are currently being processed in Namibia,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
