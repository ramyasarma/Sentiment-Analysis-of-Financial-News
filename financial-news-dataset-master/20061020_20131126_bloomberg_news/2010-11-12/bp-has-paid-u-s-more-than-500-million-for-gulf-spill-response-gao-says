BP Plc  has paid the U.S. $518
million for clean-up and other efforts related to its Gulf of
Mexico oil spill, congressional auditors said.  The Government Accountability Office released a report
today reviewing the financial risks facing the Oil Spill
Liability Trust Fund, which Congress authorized in 1990 -- after
the Exxon Valdez incident -- to pay the immediate expenses of
federal agencies responding to spills. An 8-cents-per-barrel
petroleum tax finances the fund.  While more than $1.6 billion remained in the fund as of the
end of September, disbursements for one incident can’t exceed $1
billion by law, even if oil companies reimburse the government
for the costs, according to the GAO.  The GAO report shows that federal and state agencies have
spent $581 million so far on cleanup and restoration of natural
resources damaged by the spill, triggered by the April 20
blowout on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig.  The fund is “at risk” of reaching the limit on total
expenditures for the BP spill in the “relatively near future,”
the GAO said.  The U.S. has asked for reimbursement from companies deemed
to be responsible parties for spills. BP had paid the U.S.
$518.4 million as of Oct. 12, according to the GAO report.  Congress is considering legislation to lift the $1 billion
restriction. The GAO recommended a more elastic cap in which the
money reimbursed by oil companies is not counted against the
limit.  Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, said in an e-mail
today that “it is unlikely that the current cap of $1 billion
will sustain the eventual cost of this monumental clean-up and
recovery effort.”  ‘Common-sense Approach’  Carper, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee’s panel on federal financial
management, called the GAO’s recommendation a “workable,
common-sense approach.”  The federal oil-spill fund is separate from the  Gulf Coast
Claims Facility , the entity run by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg to
compensate people and businesses hurt by the spill. BP said it
will dedicate $20 billion to that program.  The U.S. Coast Guard has identified BP,  Transocean Ltd .,
which operated the drilling rig, and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp .
and MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC, part owners of the ruptured well, as
responsible parties and therefore potentially required to
reimburse the government for its spill costs. So far, BP is the
only company that has paid.  The GAO report was requested by Carper; Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse , a Rhode Island Democrat; Democratic Representatives
John Conyers of Michigan and Nick Rahall of West Virginia; and
Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican.  To contact the reporter on this story:
