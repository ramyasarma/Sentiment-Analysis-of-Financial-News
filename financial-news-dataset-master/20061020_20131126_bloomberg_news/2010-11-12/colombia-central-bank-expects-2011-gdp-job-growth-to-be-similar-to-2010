Colombian policy makers meeting last
month said they expect growth in the economy and employment next
year will be similar to that seen in this year, according the
minutes of their Oct. 29 meeting.  The seven-member  board , led by central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe , held the interbank rate at a  record  low 3 percent
for a sixth straight month at the meeting and forecast economic
growth next year at close to 4.5 percent.  The bank analyzed “forecasted growth of the economy and
employment for 2010 and 2011 that suggests growth similar to
what was seen in 2010,” the minutes said. “The economy is
still being boosted by consumer confidence, the high terms of
trade, the strengthening of business investment and the recovery
of the financial system portfolio.”  President  Juan Manuel Santos  expects the economy to grow 6
percent annually within two years after 0.4 percent expansion
last year. He intends to create 2.4 million jobs to bring the
 jobless  rate down to single digits from 11.5 percent in
September.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 1,867.33 per dollar at 1:31
p.m. New York time from 1,858.50 yesterday.  The bank also discussed the currency’s effect on inflation
and productive sectors and ways to ease gains in the peso, which
has risen 9.5 percent this year. After the meeting, Uribe
announced that the bank would purchase a minimum of $20 million
daily in the spot market through at least March 15, two months
longer than originally announced.  Policy makers said there is a “high degree of confidence”
that inflation will end 2010 and 2011 in the lower half of the
long term target range of 2 percent to 4 percent. Colombia’s
annual  inflation  rate was 2.28 percent in September.  “The board emphasized that the information received
indicates that the Colombian economy is growing at the pace
predicted a couple of months ago without causing inflationary
pressure,” the minutes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
