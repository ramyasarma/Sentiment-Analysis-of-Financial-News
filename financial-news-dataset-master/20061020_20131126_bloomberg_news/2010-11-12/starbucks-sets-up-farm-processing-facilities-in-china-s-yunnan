Starbucks Corp. , the world’s
biggest coffee chain, will set up a farm and processing
facilities in China’s southern Yunnan province, from which its
coffee purchases have grown 20 fold in three years.  The farm and coffee-processing facilities will be built in
Pu’er county, where the namesake tea is grown,  Starbucks  said
in a statement today. It will also establish a farmers’ support
center, its first in Asia and third globally, following Costa
Rica and Rwanda.  China will eventually be Starbucks’ biggest market, Chief
Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  said at a briefing in Yunnan
today. He plans to have “thousands” of stores in the world’s
most populous country, he said in April, from about 400 now.  Yunnan plans to invest 3 million yuan ($452,000) to
increase bean production to 200,000 tons by 2020, from the
current 38,000 tons, according to the release. The province
will also increase the acreage devoted to coffee almost
fourfold to 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres),  Starbucks  said.  The coffee chain last year started selling its South of
the Clouds Blend coffee, made with Yunnan beans. It didn’t 
disclose how much it plans to invest in the province.  Coffee chain operators are expanding in  China , as
increasingly affluent consumers buy more beverages in coffee
shops.  Starbucks  is seeking to boost coffee consumption in
China, which is at an annual 22 grams per person, compared with
an estimated 3.3 kilograms in Japan, according to data from
roaster Key Coffee Inc.  Coffee Sales Surge  Middle-income and affluent consumers in China will
probably almost triple in 10 years, Boston Consulting Group Inc.
said Nov. 8.  Sales at China’s coffee shops more than tripled to
35 million yuan in 2009 from 11 million yuan in 2004, according
to data from  Euromonitor International . Starbucks dominated the
market with 69.8 percent market share last year, compared with
No. 2 player Jiangsu Yueda Group Co. Ltd. which operates Costa
Coffee restaurants and has a 5 percent share, according to the
researcher.  The number of China’s specialist coffee shops rose to
613 last year from 220 in 2004.  Starbucks  outlets comprised 59
percent of the total, while Jiangsu Yueda controlled 6 percent
by the end of 2009, according to Euromonitor.  Gourmet Master Co., operator of Taiwan’s largest coffee-
shop chain, plans to increase its China outlets more than
sixfold to 1,000 by 2015.  China Resources Enterprise Ltd. ,
which in June said it will acquire control over Hong Kong’s
second-biggest coffee chain, last month said it plans to open
as many as 1,000 Pacific Coffee shops in China.  Starbucks  has about 800 stores in the Greater China region.
About half are in mainland China, which doesn’t include Hong
Kong, Macau and Taiwan. The restaurant chain’s first mainland
China store opened in Beijing in 1999.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
