Bank of Ireland Plc said its full-
year underlying operating profit before impairment charges may
fall about 25 percent to 40 percent from 1.5 billion euros last
year.  The Dublin-based lender’s Irish retail customer deposit
base “has been stable,” though “we have had outflows of
ratings-sensitive customer deposits in our capital markets
business,” it said in an interim management statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
