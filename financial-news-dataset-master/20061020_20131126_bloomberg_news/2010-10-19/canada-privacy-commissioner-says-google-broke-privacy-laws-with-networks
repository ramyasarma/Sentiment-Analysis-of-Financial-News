Google Inc. ’s Street View feature
violated Canada’s privacy law by accessing personal information
from unsecured wireless networks, a government official said.  The violation was partly the result of a “careless error”
by an engineer, and the matter will be closed if the company
makes recommended changes by Feb. 1, Privacy Commissioner
 Jennifer Stoddart  said in a  statement  today.  Spain and the Czech Republic have also said the Street View
mapping system could break privacy laws, and there have also
been investigations from regulators in Germany, France and
Italy. The Mountain View, California-based company, which owns
the world’s largest search engine, sent cars into neighborhoods
to gather information on local services.  Thousands of Canadians may have given up information such
as usernames, passwords and a list of contact information for
people with medical conditions, Canada’s privacy office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
