---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: U.S. stocks tumbled, dragging benchmark indexes to
their biggest drop since August, amid concern banks will be
forced to buy back soured mortgages and after Apple Inc.
forecast profit that missed analyst estimates.
*Bank of America Corp. slid 3.4 percent after people familiar
with the matter said Pacific Investment Management Co, BlackRock
Inc. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are seeking to
make it buy loans that were packaged into $47 billion of bonds.
*The S&P 500 Index lost 2 percent to 1,161.52 at 3:28 p.m.
in New York, the biggest decline since Aug. 19.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 216.80 points, or 2
percent, to 10,926.80.  London: European stocks fell the most in two weeks, led by
basic-resources and technology shares, after China raised its
benchmark interest rate and Apple Inc.’s earnings forecast
missed analyst estimates.

the People’s Bank of China increased its lending and deposit
rates for the first time since 2007.

European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 and France’s CAC 40
slid 0.7 percent. Germany’s DAX fell 0.4 percent.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks rose after Citigroup Inc. reported profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates, boosting the outlook for

declined.
*Sumitomo Chemical Co. advanced 3.1 percent after Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. raised its investment

at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar rallied the most in two months against a

unexpected increase in interest rates discouraged demand for
assets related to economic growth.

rose 0.3 percent to 81.51 yen.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasury 30-year bonds rose, pushing yields down from
near a two-month high as stocks fell after China’s unexpected

economy is operating at close to “stall speed” and cast doubt on
the effectiveness of additional monetary easing.
*Thirty-year bond yields  fell two basis points, or 0.02

*Ten-year yields decreased less than one basis point to 2.5

to $1,343.30 an ounce at 11:53 a.m. on the Comex in New York.  METALS  New York: Copper fell from a 27-month high after China, the

rates to curb inflation.
*Copper futures for December delivery fell 10.3 cents, or
2.7 percent, to $3.752 a pound at 10:06 a.m. on the Comex in New

following an acceleration in inflation.
