Robusta coffee rose the most in
almost six weeks in London on concern about stockpiles in
Vietnam and production in Colombia. White sugar climbed.  The volume of unsold coffee in Vietnam, the world’s biggest
robusta grower, is probably less than 500,000 bags before the
new crop, the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association said Sept.
30. That compares with between 2 million and 2.5 million bags at
the same time last year.  “Until we start seeing the newly harvested beans coming
out of Vietnam, there’s not a lot of availability right now,”
said  Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.
“Essentially, the past-season stocks have been run down to very
low levels.”  Robusta coffee for January delivery gained $38, or 2.3
percent, to $1,718 a metric ton at 12:52 p.m. on NYSE Liffe.
Prices rose as much as 3.9 percent, the most since Sept. 8.  Colombia, the second-largest producer of arabica coffee,
said Oct. 15 a fungus that damages plants may reduce bean
production next year, a day after growers cut the forecast for
this year’s harvest. Above-average rainfall that affects plants’
ability to flower also may hamper next year’s crop, Agriculture
Minister  Juan Restrepo  said.  No ‘Bumper Crop’  “We are looking at a recovery in Colombian production, but
not as high as one would have liked because of the fungus and
humidity,” said Haque. “We really needed a bumper crop to
alleviate any shortage, and we’re not likely to get that.”  Colombian growers cut the 2010 crop forecast by 5 percent
to 9.5 million bags on Oct. 14.  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $1.862 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Prices advanced as much as 1.8 percent.  Sugar gained in London on concern that adverse weather
hampered harvests in Brazil, the world’s largest producer, and
Russia. Brazil may produce less sugar next year because of a
drought and aging fields,  Stefan Uhlenbrock , an analyst with
Ratzeburg, Germany-based researcher F.O. Licht, said yesterday.
Output may come to 40.5 million tons this year, he said.  “Brazil’s likely to have a lower cane crop next year,”
Macquarie’s Haque said.  Imports Into Russia  White, or refined, sugar for December delivery rose $2.70,
or 0.4 percent, to $698 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Russian raw-sugar imports may rise as much as 300,000 tons
before 2010 ends, the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies
said Oct. 15, cutting its forecast for refining from beets grown
domestically by 6.4 percent. The country suffered this year from
its worst drought in at least half a century.  “Due to its own sugar supply, affected by heat and fires,
Russia will have to increase its imports considerably in 2010-11
and could become the third-largest importer,” Commerzbank AG
analysts led by Frankfurt-based  Eugen Weinberg  said in a note
today.  Raw sugar for March delivery slipped 0.01 cent to 27.57
cents a pound in New York, erasing a gain of as much as 2
percent.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to 1,851
pounds ($2,914) a ton on NYSE Liffe. In New York, cocoa for
December delivery dropped 1.7 percent to $2,746 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
