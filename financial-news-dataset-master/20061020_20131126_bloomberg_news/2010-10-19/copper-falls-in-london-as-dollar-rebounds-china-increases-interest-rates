Copper fell from a 27-month high
after China, the biggest consumer of the metal, increased its
lending and deposit rates to curb inflation.  The country’s inflation quickened to 3.5 percent in August,
the fastest pace in 22 months. Other industrial metals also
retreated and the dollar jumped as much as 1.5 percent against a
basket of six major currencies.  “Copper is most sensitive to demand from China,” said
 Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. “China’s steps to rein in inflation will hurt any
industrial metal.”  Copper futures for December delivery fell 10.3 cents, or
2.7 percent, to $3.752 a pound at 10:06 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. A close at that level would be the biggest decline for the
most-active contract since July 16. Yesterday, the metal reached
$3.88, the highest price since July 2008.  The People’s Bank of China said the one-year lending rate
will increase to 5.56 percent from 5.31 percent, effective
tomorrow. The deposit rate will increase to 2.5 percent from
2.25 percent, the bank said on its website.  “Copper is very much dependent on growth in China, so you
can see a build-up in inventories from this,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in
Chicago.  Fed Expectations  Before today, copper rose 5.6 percent this month as the
dollar lost 2.3 percent against the basket of currencies on
expectations that the Federal Reserve will further ease monetary
policy to bolster the economy. The benchmark U.S. interest rate
has been at zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  “This could represent the first move in a new approach
from the Chinese authorities,” said  Nic Brown , an analyst at
Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd. in London. “If the Fed is to go
ahead with more quantitative easing, China may have decided that
simply raising minimum reserve ratios isn’t enough anymore.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $200.50, or 2.4 percent, to $8,242.50 a metric
ton ($3.74 a pound). Aluminum lead, nickel, tin and zinc also
fell.  To contact the reporters on the story:
