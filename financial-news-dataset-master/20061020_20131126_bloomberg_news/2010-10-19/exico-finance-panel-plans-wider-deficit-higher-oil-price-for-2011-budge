Mexico ’s finance committee in the
lower house of Congress approved the income portion of the 2012
budget with a wider deficit than President Felipe Calderon
originally proposed.  The panel passed the 2012 budget with a deficit equal to
0.4 percent of gross domestic product yesterday while
maintaining an estimated oil price of $84.9 a barrel.  Calderon had proposed a budget deficit of 36.7 billion
pesos, or 0.2 percent of the country’s GDP, excluding
investments in state oil company  Petroleos Mexicanos .  The initiative approved yesterday, which will now go to
the floor of the lower house, would decrease the official
forecast for economic growth to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent and
change the forecast for the peso’s exchange rate to 12.8 per
 U.S. dollar  from 12.2.  The bill also raises Mexico’s estimated oil production to
2.56 million barrels a day from a previous estimate of 2.55
million barrels a day.  The legislation would postpone the cancellation of a
federal tax on gasoline sales, a portion of which is channeled
to state governments.  The changes approved by the committee would give the
government more than 80 billion pesos ($5.9 billion) of
additional revenue next year, which would go toward education
and farming programs, Sebastian Lerdo said yesterday in
statements to reporters in Mexico City.  Calderon on Sept. 8 proposed total spending of 3.62 trillion
pesos ($290 billion) for next year, an increase of 2.5 percent
in real terms from 2011.  The lower house must approve the income portion of the
budget today and the spending portion by Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
