Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker
run by Fiat SpA, appointed the first group of U.S. Fiat
franchise locations as the automaker moves to bring the Italian
brand back to the nation.  The Chrysler dealers that were granted Fiat franchises have
plans in place and will be ready to take orders for the Fiat 500
subcompact car, the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company said in
a statement on its website today.  The automaker didn’t give an exact number of franchises
appointed in what it described as the first phase and said
additional dealers will be appointed later in the year. Chrysler
repeated that it would like Fiat dealers in 119 markets. The
company has said it wants about 165 U.S. Fiat locations.  “We have carefully considered each of these dealer
proposals looking for the best locations and the most creative
plans,” Peter Grady , Chrysler’s vice president of network
development, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
