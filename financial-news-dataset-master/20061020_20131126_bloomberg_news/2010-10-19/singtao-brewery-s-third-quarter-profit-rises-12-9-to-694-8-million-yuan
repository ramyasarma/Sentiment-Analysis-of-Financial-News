Tsingtao Brewery Co ., the Chinese
beer company founded by German settlers more than a century ago,
said third-quarter profit rose 13 percent from a year earlier as
expanded capacity supported sales.  Net income  rose to 694.8 million yuan ($105 million), or
0.51 yuan a share, according to a statement on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange website today. Nine-month profit was 1.52 billion
yuan, it said, without providing comparable figures.  The company boosted nine-month revenue from principal
operations by 11 percent to 16.1 billion yuan as it expanded
capacity and acquired plants from Jiahe Brewery Co. in Taiyuan,
Shanxi province, according to the statement.  Beer sales by volume rose by 6.8 percent to 52.8 million
hectoliters in the first nine months, it said.  The  stock  rose 0.5 percent to HK$43 in Hong Kong today,
before the earnings. Tsingtao is unchanged this year, compared
with the benchmark Hang Seng Index’s 8.7 percent advance.  -- Zhang Dingmin . Editors: Gregory Turk, Josh Fellman  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
