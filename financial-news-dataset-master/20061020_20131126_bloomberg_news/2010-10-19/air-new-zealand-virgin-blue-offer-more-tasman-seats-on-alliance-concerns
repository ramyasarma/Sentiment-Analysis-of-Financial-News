Air New Zealand Ltd.  and  Virgin Blue
Holdings Ltd. , seeking to cooperate on trans-Tasman Sea flights,
offered to add seats on six routes to allay regulatory concerns
that the alliance will lead to service cuts and higher fares.  The two airlines are prepared to increase capacity on the
New Zealand-Australia routes by 10 percent over three years and
by 15 percent over five years, according to a submission posted
on the  Australian Competition & Consumer Commission ’s website.  Air N.Z. and Virgin Blue are willing to commit to extra
flights in the expectation that collaboration will boost
passenger numbers, they said in the submission. Last month, the
antitrust regulator said it was opposed to the proposed tie-up,
jeopardizing attempts by the carriers to work together to help
compete with  Qantas Airways Ltd.  and its Jetstar budget unit.  The routes covered by the offer include flights from
Brisbane to Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin; from Sydney to
Wellington and Queenstown; and from Melbourne to Wellington. The
carriers also said they wouldn’t cut overall trans-Tasman
capacity below current levels.  The promise of extra flights from New Zealand’s capital has
persuaded Wellington International Airport Ltd. to drop its
opposition to the pact, the Dominion Post reported today, citing
Chief Executive Officer Steve Fitzgerald.  To contact the reporter on this story:
