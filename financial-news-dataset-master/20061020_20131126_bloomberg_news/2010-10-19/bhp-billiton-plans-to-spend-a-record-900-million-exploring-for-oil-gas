BHP Billiton Ltd. , Australia’s
largest oil and gas producer, expects to spend a record $900
million on petroleum exploration in the financial year ending
June 2011.  BHP, which is drilling off Australia and in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico, will likely spend most of that budget in the second
half, the Melbourne-based company said today in a statement to
the Australian stock exchange. The company said it spent $74
million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30.  BHP, whose operations in the Gulf of Mexico were disrupted
by the drilling moratorium the Obama administration imposed
after the  BP Plc  oil spill, expects oil and gas production for
the 2011 financial year to be “in line” with the prior year.
BHP’s output for the year that ended June 30 rose 15 percent to
158.6 million barrels.  Production increased 3 percent to 43.1 million barrels of
oil equivalent in the first quarter, driven by the Pyrenees
project and the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas venture
in Australia, according to BHP, which is also the world’s
biggest mining company. The suspension of drilling in the Gulf
and aging fields partially offset the gains, it said.  BHP and  Apache Corp.  said last month that they would
proceed with the $1.5 billion Macedon natural gas project in
Western Australia to meet increasing demand driven by the
state’s mining industry. Macedon, expected to start production
in 2013, is 3 percent complete, BHP said today.  BHP’s exploration expenditure was $817 million in the 2010
financial year, the company said July 21. Exploration in the
“next several years” will focus on the Gulf, Malaysia,
Australia, Canada and the Falklands, its website shows.  BHP dropped 1.1 percent to A$40.69 at 10:28 a.m. in Sydney
trading as the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
