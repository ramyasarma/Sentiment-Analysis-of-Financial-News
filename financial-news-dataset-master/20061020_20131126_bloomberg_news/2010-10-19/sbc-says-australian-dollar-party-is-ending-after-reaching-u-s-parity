The Australian dollar may be poised
for a drop after trading at parity with its U.S. counterpart,
because Chinese property prices risk falling and hurting
Australian banks, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  “With much of Australia’s positive fundamentals already
priced in, there is little upside to the Australian dollar from
here,” London-based analysts  David Bloom  and  Paul Mackel  wrote
in an investor note dated Oct. 15 and e-mailed to reporters
today. “Indeed we see plenty of room for a mild retracement and
the possibility of a very large one. This is one party which is
coming to an end soon.”  The Australian dollar fell 1.7 percent against the U.S.
currency to 97.25 U.S. cents as of 2:35 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
