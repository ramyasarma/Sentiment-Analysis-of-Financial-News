Orpea SA, France’s largest
commercial retirement-home operator, will raise its 2011 sales
target to 1.21 billion euros, French daily Les Echos reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The company’s current goal is for 2011 revenue of 1.1
billion euros.  Orpea will announce the acquisition of 5,000 beds in France
and Belgium for 129 million euros in a statement to be released
before trading today, the newspaper said.  The company also plans to split the roles of chairman and
chief executive officer, Les Echos said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
