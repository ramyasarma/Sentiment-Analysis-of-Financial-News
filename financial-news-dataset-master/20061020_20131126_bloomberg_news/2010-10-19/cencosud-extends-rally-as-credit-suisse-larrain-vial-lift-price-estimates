Cencosud SA  capped the biggest two-
day gain in two months after Credit Suisse Group AG, Larrain
Vial SA and Banco de Credito e Inversiones raised their share
price forecasts for Chile’s largest retailer by sales.  Cencosud  climbed 3.3 percent to 3,490.6 pesos today and has
advanced 7.7 percent in the two trading days since announcing a
1.35 billion-real ($814 million) acquisition of Brazilian
supermarket chain Bretas.  Credit Suisse increased its 12-month price estimate to
3,700 pesos from 3,200 pesos, reiterated an “outperform”
rating and trimmed Cencosud’s cost of equity to 13.2 percent
from 13.3 percent on increased Brazil exposure, analysts
including  Antonio Gonzalez  wrote in an e-mailed note.  “Over the past five years the company has increased its
sales five times and should double current sales by 2013,” the
Credit Suisse analysts wrote.  Larrain Vial’s Santiago-based brokerage raised its estimate
for Cencosud shares to 4,020 pesos from 3,600 pesos while BCI
increased its forecast to 3,900 pesos from 3,685 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
