Skipper Energy , a power company
operating in the Middle East, India, Switzerland and Ghana,
plans to spend about $1.5 billion to build two coal-fueled power
plants in  Nigeria  by 2013.  “Each will have a capacity for 500 megawatts and cost $750
million to $800 million,” Jitender Sachdeva, the company
president, said yesterday in an interview in the Nigerian
capital, Abuja. The plants will be in Odu and Abocho in Kogi
state, central Nigeria, using coal from nearby Okaba and Ogbogbo
coal mines where the company has concessions, Sachdeva said.  Under a plan announced by Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan  on Aug. 26, Africa’s most populous country will wind
down the state power monopoly by next year and allow private
companies to build gas-fired, coal-fueled and hydropower plants.
The government will also sell the 11 distribution units of the
state-owned Power Holding Co. of Nigeria and its power plants.  Power cuts occur daily in Nigeria, where demand for
electricity is almost double the current supply of about 3,000
megawatts. The government wants to increase output to 14,019
megawatts by 2013.  “There is a new political will for reform” which has
spurred Skipper Energy to invest, Sachdeva said. Financing for
the planned projects will be through “a debt-equity model,” he
said without giving details.  Skipper Energy first came to Nigeria in 2000, setting up a
factory in Lagos, the country’s economic capital, to make
electrical components. It signed a memorandum of understanding
with the government in 2009 to go into power generation,
Sachdeva said.  Nigeria needs investments of $10 billion a year to meet a
target of increasing generating capacity to 40,000 megawatts by
2020, Minister of State for Power  Nuhu Wya  said on Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
