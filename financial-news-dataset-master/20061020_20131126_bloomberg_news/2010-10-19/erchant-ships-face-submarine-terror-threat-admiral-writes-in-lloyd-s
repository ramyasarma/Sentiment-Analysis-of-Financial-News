The merchant-shipping industry faces
a threat from terrorists using submarines, Rear Admiral
Christopher Parry, chairman of the U.K. government’s Marine
Management Organisation, wrote in  Lloyd’s List .  There are “evident” opportunities for terrorists to use
subsea craft to attack ships, energy installations and urban
targets and to lay mines and improvised explosive devices, he
wrote in an article published today.  Use of mini-submarines and semisubmersible vehicles has
become more popular in recent years among drug traffickers,
according to Parry. Further exploitation of the vessels by
terrorists and criminals is “likely,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
