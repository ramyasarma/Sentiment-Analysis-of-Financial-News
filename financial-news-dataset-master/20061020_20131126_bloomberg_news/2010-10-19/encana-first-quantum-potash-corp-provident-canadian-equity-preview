Canadian stocks  fell for a second
day, heading for the first weekly decline in six weeks, as gold
producers fell with prices for the precious metal.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, declined
0.6 percent as gold prices fluctuated in New York after dropping
to a two-week low. Shaw Communications Inc., Canada’s largest
cable and satellite television provider, decreased 4.1 percent
after reporting  earnings  that missed the average analyst
estimate. Copper producer Lundin Mining Corp. climbed 7 percent
after the Democratic Republic of Congo confirmed a joint
venture’s mining contract.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  slipped 27.94
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,571.29 as of 10:03 a.m. in
Toronto. For the week, the index has lost 0.3 percent.  If the S&P/TSX ends the week with a gain, it would mark the
sixth-straight weekly increase, the longest streak since April
2009. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Commodity Price Index 
has surged 7.4 percent during the period through yesterday as
the U.S. dollar has declined on speculation central-bank
stimulus measures will weaken the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
