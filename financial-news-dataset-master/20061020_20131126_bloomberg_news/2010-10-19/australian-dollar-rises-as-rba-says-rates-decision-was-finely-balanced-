The Australian dollar advanced after
policy makers said this month’s decision to leave borrowing
costs unchanged was “finely balanced.”  The so-called Aussie touched 99.60 U.S. cents before
trading at 99.42 cents as of 11:37 a.m. in Sydney, from 99.27
cents before the Reserve Bank of Australia released minutes from
its Oct. 5 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
