Some Iranians began receiving cash
payments from the government to cushion poorer families from
rising prices that will result from the planned phasing-out of
food and energy subsidies, the state-run  Mehr  news agency said.  The head of each eligible household in the provinces of
North Khorasan, South Khorasan and Khorasan Razavi will see
their accounts credited with about $80 today, Mehr said.  Iran plans to eliminate the subsidies on fuel, electricity
and basic consumer goods over the course of five years. The
government has said it will pay grants every two months to low-
income families to compensate for the plan’s inflationary
repercussions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
