Margaret Thatcher , the former U.K.
prime minister, has been admitted to hospital for tests
following a recent flu infection.  The tests are understood to be “precautionary,” and Prime
Minister  David Cameron  wishes Thatcher a “speedy recovery,” a
Downing Street spokesman said today.  Thatcher who was prime minister between 1979 and 1990,
missed a party on Oct. 14 held in honor of her 85th birthday,
after being taken ill with flu. The party, hosted by Cameron,
took place at No. 10 Downing Street, the official residence of
British prime ministers.  Thatcher helped end the Cold War and was known as “the
Iron Lady” for her dominance of British politics during the
1980s. She promoted free-market economics by curbing public
spending, selling state-owned companies and cutting the top tax
rate to 40 percent from 83 percent when she took office in 1979.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
