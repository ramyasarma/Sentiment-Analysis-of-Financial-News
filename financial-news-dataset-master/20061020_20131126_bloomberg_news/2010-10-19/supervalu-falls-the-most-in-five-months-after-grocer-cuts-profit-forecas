SuperValu Inc.  fell the most in 20
months after the Minnesota-based grocer lowered its earnings
forecast for 2011, saying improvements will take longer than
originally planned.  The shares dropped 15 percent after the Eden Prairie-based
company said today that profit, excluding some items, will be at
least $1.40 a share. The previous forecast was at least $1.75.
The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
$1.66.  Sales declined for the sixth straight  quarter , dragged down
by a “difficult operating environment,” Chief Executive
Officer  Craig Herkert  said in the statement. The grocer faces
increasing competition from discount retailers such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Target Corp., which also are offering more fresh
food.  “It will take longer than originally anticipated to
realize the benefit of the marketing, merchandising and
operational initiatives that we continue to build upon,”
Herkert said.  SuperValu slumped $1.85 to $10.55 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest decline since
February 2009. The stock was the worst performer in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index today.  The second-quarter  net loss  was $1.47 billion, or $6.94 a
share, compared with a profit of $74 million, or 35 cents, a
year earlier. The bulk of the expense came from a $1.6 billion
pretax writedown on the value of goodwill and intangible assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
