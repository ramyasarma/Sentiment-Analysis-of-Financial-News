Morgan Stanley said it’s staying
“bullish” on Chinese stocks after the central bank yesterday

saying that “early rate hikes very rarely conclude a market
peak.”  The brokerage reduced its weighting in China property
stocks and added to banks, acording to a report by analysts led
by Jerry Lou.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
