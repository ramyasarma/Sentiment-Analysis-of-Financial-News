Gasoline fell the most in 15 months
as China’s unexpected interest-rate increase sent the dollar
higher and commodities lower.  Gasoline sank after China raised key lending rates for the
first time since 2007. The dollar gained 1.5 percent versus the
euro as of 3:13 p.m. in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index lost 2 percent and crude oil was down 4.3 percent.  “Energy prices are being like a football, getting kicked
back and forth by the dollar and the stock market, because it’s
all about economic expectations and whether we reflate or
deflate,” said  Walter J. Zimmerman Jr ., vice president of
market analysis at United-ICAP in Jersey City, New Jersey.  Gasoline for November delivery dropped 10.32 cents, or 4.8
percent, to settle at $2.0483 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest decline since July 8,
2009, when prices lost 5.7 percent.  China’s central bank yesterday raised rates to combat
inflation, lifting the benchmark one-year lending rate to 5.56
percent from 5.31 percent and the deposit rate to 2.5 percent
from 2.25 percent.  “It seems to have put pressure on equities and put
pressure on the euro and those are two main factors pulling
investors in and out of oil these days,” said  Peter Beutel ,
president of trading advisory company Cameron Hanover Inc. in
New Canaan, Connecticut.  Commodities Fall  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index of 19 commodities
dropped 1.9 percent to 292.98 at 2:48 p.m. Thirteen of the
commodities declined and six gained.  “Risk appetite is getting pulled back,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,
Florida.  Gasoline supplies probably fell 1.5 million barrels last
week, according to the median estimate of 16 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News. Stockpiles of distillates, including
heating oil and diesel, probably dropped 1 million barrels.  The premium of gasoline over crude oil, or the crack
spread, based on November contracts, narrowed 74 cents to $6.54
a barrel.  Heating oil for November delivery fell 8.68 cents, or 3.8
percent, to settle at $2.1893 a gallon, a three-week low. It was
the biggest loss since June 4.  The premium of heating oil over crude oil lost 6 cents to
$12.46 a barrel.  Regular gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $2.829 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
