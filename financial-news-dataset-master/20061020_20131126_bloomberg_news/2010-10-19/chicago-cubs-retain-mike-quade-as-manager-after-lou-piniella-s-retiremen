The Chicago Cubs will stick with
 Mike Quade  as manager, signing him to a two-year contract today.  Quade will be introduced by the Major League Baseball team
at a press conference this afternoon at Wrigley Field, the Cubs
said in a  statement  on their website. Financial terms weren’t
disclosed.  New York Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  had been a candidate
for the Cubs’ job, New York and Chicago newspapers reported.
Girardi, in the final year of his contract in New York, is an
Illinois native and a graduate of Northwestern University in the
Chicago suburbs.  Quade, 53, became the 51st manager in franchise history
when he took the position on Aug. 23, a day after  Lou Piniella ’s
retirement. He previously served as the club’s third-base coach
for four seasons and managed Chicago’s Triple-A Iowa team from
2003 through 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
