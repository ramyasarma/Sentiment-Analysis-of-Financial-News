Hochschild Mining Plc , a gold and
silver producer in Latin America, pared gains in London trading
after reaching a record-high earlier today.  Hochschild  fell 1.5 percent to 484.3 pence at 4:30 p.m.
local time, the lowest close in a week. The stock earlier
touched 522 pence, the highest price since the shares started
trading in 2006, after Hochschild extended the life of its San
Jose mine in Argentina.  The resource life of the San Jose operation was increased
to about 12.5 years, from about 8.4 years in December 2009, the
London-based company said today in a statement. Hochschild said
Oct. 7 it found nine new high-grade gold/silver veins and
“significant” extensions to two existing veins at the mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
