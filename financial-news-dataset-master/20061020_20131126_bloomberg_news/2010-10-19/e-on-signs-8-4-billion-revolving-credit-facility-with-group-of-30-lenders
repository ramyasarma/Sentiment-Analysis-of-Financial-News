E.ON AG , Germany’s biggest utility,
said it signed a 6 billion-euro ($8.4 billion) credit line with
a group of 30 banks.  The five-year revolving credit will replace the company’s
two credit lines, one of which matures in November and the other
in 2011, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a statement. Money
in a revolving credit can be borrowed again once it’s been
repaid.  Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Capital coordinated the
deal, which pays initial interest of 47.5 basis points more than
the euro interbank offered rate on money E.ON draws from the
facility, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The interest margin will fall to 37.5 basis points if
E.ON is upgraded by Standard & Poor’s to AA- or above, and will
rise to 65 basis points if the company’s credit is downgraded to
BBB+ or below, Bloomberg data show.  E.ON is rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service and A by
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
