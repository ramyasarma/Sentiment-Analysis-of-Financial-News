The French Senate has more than 400
amendments left to consider in the bill that raises France’s
minimum retirement age to 62 from 60, said Senator Jean-Claude
Gaudin from Marseille.  Speaking on LCI television, he said he expected a vote on
the bill in two days, though debate could last until the
weekend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
