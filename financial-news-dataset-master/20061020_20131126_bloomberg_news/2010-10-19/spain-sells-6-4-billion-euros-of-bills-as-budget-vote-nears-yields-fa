Spain sold 6.4 billion euros ($8.4
billion) of Treasury bills at an auction and its borrowing costs
declined as the ruling Socialist party headed for victory in a
vote to pass its 2011 budget law.  Spain  sold 4.18 billion euros of 12-month bills at an
average yield of 1.842 percent today, compared with 1.908
percent at the last auction on Sept. 21. It sold 2.22 billion
euros of 18-month bills at a yield of 2.009 percent, compared
with 2.146 percent in September, the Bank of Spain said. It had
set a target of 6 billion to 7 billion euros for the sale.  Spain’s most austere budget in three decades is being
debated in parliament today and tomorrow after Prime Minister
 Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  secured a majority for the vote on
his fiscal plan through accords with two regional parties. The
alliances also clear the way for Zapatero, who got an austerity
package through Parliament in May with a one-vote margin, to
overhaul the pension system and employment policies as the
country emerges from the deepest  recession  in six decades.  Investors asked for 2.06 times the amount of 12-month bills
sold, compared with 1.71 times at the Sept. 21 auction. The so-
called bid-to-cover ratio for the 18 month bills fell to 2.03
times from 2.91 at the last sale.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
debt instead of German bunds fell to a two-month low of 158.3
basis points at 11:45 a.m. in Madrid, compared with 161.7 basis
points yesterday. That’s down from a euro-era high of 221 basis
points on June 16.  Greece sold 1.2 billion euros of 13-week bills today, a day
after European Union Economic Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said the
country that avoided default in May with a European bailout may
require additional budget-cutting steps to meet its 2011 fiscal
targets. The bills were priced to yield 3.75 percent, down from
3.98 percent at the last sale on Sept. 21.  Spain is aiming to cut the  budget deficit  to 6 percent of
gross domestic product next year from 11.1 percent in 2009. This
year the deficit is forecast to be 9.3 percent of output, which
would be the second largest in the euro region after Ireland.
The targeted declined for the shortfall next year to 6 percent
of GDP would be the steepest drop since at least 1980, according
to government records.  Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  defended the 2011 budget at
the start of today’s debate, which culminates in a vote on the
fiscal plan tomorrow. If further measures are needed to cut the
deficit, Salgado said the government will take them “without
hesitating,” even as she’s “convinced” the deficit and growth
forecasts are “realistic.”  Zapatero cut public wages 5 percent in June, raised value-
added tax in July and plans a freeze on all but the lowest
pensions for next year. The 2011 budget also includes a new tax
on high earners and a plan to reduce spending by 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
