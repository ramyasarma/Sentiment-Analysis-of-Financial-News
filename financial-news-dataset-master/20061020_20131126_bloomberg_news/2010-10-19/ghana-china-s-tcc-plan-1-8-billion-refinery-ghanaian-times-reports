Ghana and  TCC of China  are reviewing
a memorandum of understanding for the building of a $1.8 billion
refinery to add to the capacity of the country’s Tema Oil
Refinery, the Ghanaian Times reported.  The new facility to be constructed by the Chinese
engineering company will refine 120,000 barrels of crude per
day, the Accra-based newspaper said, citing  Emmanuel Buah ,
deputy minister of energy.  Buah said Ghana consumes 65,000 barrels a day while Tema
can only process 45,000 barrels a day at full capacity,
according to the newspaper.
