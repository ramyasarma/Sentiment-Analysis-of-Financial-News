The People’s Bank of China sold one-
year bills at a yield of 2.0929 percent, unchanged for the 18th
sale in a row, according to traders at Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of China Ltd.  The monetary authority offered 43 billion yuan ($6.5
billion) of the securities at the auction today.  The central bank last allowed the yield to rise on June 8
to attract bids from banks, helping withdraw cash from the money
market.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
