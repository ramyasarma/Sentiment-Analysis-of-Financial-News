George Athor, a rebel leader in
Southern Sudan, will sign a peace accord with the regional
government before a January referendum over secession from the
north, Dok James, a spokesman for Athor, told reporters in the
capital, Juba, today.  Athor, a former chief of staff in Southern Sudan’s army,
took up arms against the government after losing a local
election in April. He and other militia leaders were pardoned
this month by Southern Sudan President  Salva Kiir .  The independence referendum was pledged under a 2005 peace
deal that ended 21-year civil war between Sudan’s northern and
southern regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
