German exports will rise at the
fastest pace in a decade this year, led by demand for cars and
machinery from outside Europe, the BGA federation said today.  Exports will grow by about 16 percent, pushing goods and
services sold abroad to a total value of 937 billion euros, the
Berlin-based group said today in an e-mailed statement, revising
up a forecast of about 10 percent from earlier this year.
Exports next year should grow by about 7 percent, causing the
sector to exceed the 1 trillion euro mark for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
