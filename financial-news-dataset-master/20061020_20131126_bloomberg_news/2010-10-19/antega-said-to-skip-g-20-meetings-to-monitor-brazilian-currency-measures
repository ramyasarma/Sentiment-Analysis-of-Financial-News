Brazilian Finance Minister Guido
Mantega is unlikely to attend a meeting of Group of 20 finance
ministers in South Korea this week, according to a spokesperson
who declined to be identified citing the ministry’s
communications policy.  Mantega will likely stay in Brazil to oversee the
implementation of new measures to curb gains by the real, the
spokesperson said. He will be replaced by Marcos Galvao, the
ministry’s secretary of international affairs, the spokesperson
said.  Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles is not traveling
to the G-20 summit because it conflicts with the bank’s monetary
policy meeting this week, the bank said in a statement. He will
be replaced in South Korea by Luiz Pereira, the bank’s director
for international affairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
