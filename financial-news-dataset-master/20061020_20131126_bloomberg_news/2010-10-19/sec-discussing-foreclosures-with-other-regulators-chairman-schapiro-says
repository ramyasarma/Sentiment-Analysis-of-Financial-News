U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said her agency is discussing
lenders’ handling of foreclosure documents with other regulators
and making sure firms made adequate disclosures to investors.  “Whenever there are suggestions that there may have been
any kinds of issues with respect to disclosure,
misrepresentations or omissions, we are always looking at that
kind of conduct,” Schapiro told reporters today after a speech
in Washington.  Banks including  Bank of America Corp.  temporarily halted
foreclosures this month amid concern that faulty documents may
have been used to seize homes. Attorneys general of all 50
states have opened a joint investigation into foreclosures,
saying they will seek an immediate halt to any improper
practices at mortgage lenders and loan servicers.  The SEC reviews corporate filings to ensure companies are
disclosing their true financial health to shareholders. The
agency also examines documents involved in securities sales to
make sure risks are revealed to investors. The SEC doesn’t
regulate mortgage lending.  “All the regulators are obviously talking to each other
because there are different pieces here and different areas of
expertise and responsibility,” Schapiro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
