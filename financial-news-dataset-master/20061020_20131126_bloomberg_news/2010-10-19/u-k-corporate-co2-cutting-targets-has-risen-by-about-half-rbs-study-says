The number of U.K. companies
implementing carbon-dioxide reduction targets has risen by about
50 percent since 2008, a study by the Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc showed.  Some 73 percent of companies based in the U.K. with annual
revenue of more than 25 million pounds ($35 million) are working
toward reducing CO2 emissions, the RBS study said in an e-mailed
statement. The study cited expectations of higher demand for
low-carbon goods and services as the reason for the increase.  The European Union operates the world’s largest carbon
trading scheme. At the same time, delegates from more than 190
countries are working to draft a global climate treaty that
would limit emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  “With the global market for low-carbon goods and services
expected to grow considerably in the next few years, there will
be an abundance of commercial opportunities for businesses to
exploit,” Tim Boag, managing director of structured finance at
RBS, said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
