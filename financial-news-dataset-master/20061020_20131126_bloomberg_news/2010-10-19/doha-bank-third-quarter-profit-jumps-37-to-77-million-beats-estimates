Doha Bank QSC , the country’s fourth-
biggest bank by assets, posted a bigger-than-estimated 37
percent increase in quarterly profit on gains from interest
income.  Net income rose to 280.6 million riyals ($77 million) in
the third quarter from 204.5 million riyals a year earlier, the
bank said in a filing to the Qatar Exchange today. The  median
estimate  of four analysts was for a profit of 272 million
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  "These results not only demonstrate the strength of the
bank’s underlying operations but also the efficient deployment
of shareholder’s funds," Managing Director Abdul Rehman Bin
Mohammad Bin Jabor Al-Thani said in the statement. The bank’s
return on average equity was 22 percent, he said.  Qatari banks, which suffered losses related to the global
economic slowdown, have benefited from a pickup in the economy.
Bank lending rose 19 percent and customer deposits increased 23
percent in August from a year earlier, according to central bank
statistics.  Qatar National Bank SAQ , the country’s biggest
lender, posted a 37 percent jump in third-quarter profit, while
 Commercial Bank of Qatar  posted a 29 percent increase in profit
for the same period.  Doha Bank said it will seek shareholders’ approval in two
months to sell $500 million in senior bonds. The lender may sell
bonds by the end of this year in both dollars and the local
riyal currency, Chief Executive Officer  Raghavan Seetharaman 
said in July.  Nine-month net interest income rose 23 percent to 973
million riyals, while fee and commission income gained 13
percent to 307 million riyals, and loans and advances increased
7 percent to 26.6 billion riyals, the bank said.  Doha Bank  shares fell 0.2 percent to 54.9 riyals on the
Qatar Exchange today. The shares have risen 17 percent this year
compared with a 12 percent gain for the benchmark  QE Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
