Glencore International AG said it’s
in talks to buy control of a sugar mill in  Brazil  as prices for
the sweetener are expected to rise.  Glencore may acquire 70 percent of the Rio Vermelho mill,
in a deal that could be concluded in November, Claudio Piquet, a
director for the company, said today at an event in  Sao Paulo .
Sao Paulo-based Valor Economico newspaper reported yesterday
that Glencore was in talks to buy the mill for $80 million.  “It would be our first investment in a sugar mill anywhere
in the world, and of course it had to be in Brazil,” he said.  Sugar prices may “test” 30.4 cents a pound this year,
Piquet said. Futures have surged 97 percent since the start of
June amid concern that adverse weather will reduce supplies in
nations such as Brazil, the world’s largest producer of the
sweetener. Raw sugar for March delivery gained 2.7 percent to
28.33 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
