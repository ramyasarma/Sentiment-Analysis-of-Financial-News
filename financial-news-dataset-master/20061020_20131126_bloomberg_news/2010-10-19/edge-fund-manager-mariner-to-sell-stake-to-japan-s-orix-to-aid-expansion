Mariner Investment Group, a $12
billion hedge-fund manager, plans to sell a “significant”
stake of the holding company to a unit of Japan’s  Orix Corp.  to
help it expand its asset-management business.  The deal will have no impact on Mariner’s investment
process and all after-tax proceeds from the sale will be
reinvested by the partners in Mariner’s business and its funds,
according to a letter the Harrison, New York-based firm sent to
investors today.  “This is a unique opportunity to partner with a global
financial institution whose experience and footprint,
particularly in Asia, will boost our efforts to recruit
additional investment talent to our growing investment
business,”  William Michaelcheck , founder and chief investment
officer of Mariner, wrote in the letter.  The purchase was reported earlier today by Nikkei English
News, which said Orix will buy the Mariner stake for about 15
billion yen ($184 million).  Mariner will keep its nine-member management committee and
add two non-voting, observing members from Orix, said a person
briefed on the plans who asked not to be named because the
information is private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
