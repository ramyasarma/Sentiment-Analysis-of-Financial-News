The Bank of Japan may further ease
its monetary stance if the economy deteriorates, the Asahi
newspaper reported, citing an interview with Masaaki Shirakawa,
the governor of the central bank.   Shirakawa said the BOJ may increase the size of a fund
created to purchase mutual funds and government bonds, the
newspaper reported.  The bank will maintain its “virtual zero-rate policy”
until it decides that consumer prices are likely to rise, the
newspaper cites Shirakawa as saying.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
