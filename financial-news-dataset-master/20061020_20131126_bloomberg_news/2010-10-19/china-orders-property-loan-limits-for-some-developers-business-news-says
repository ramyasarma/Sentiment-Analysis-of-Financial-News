China’s banking regulator issued a
notice to the nation’s lenders ordering a halt of real estate
loans to developers found to be hoarding land or property, the
China Business News reported today, without citing anyone.  Banks were also told not to accept applications for real
estate loans from the 78 central government owned enterprises
ordered in March to exit the property market as real estate
development isn’t their core business, the newspaper reported.
The China Banking Regulatory Commission also ordered banks not
to accept loan applications from developers that don’t put up
the projects they’re borrowing for as collateral for the loans,
the China Business News reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
