Italy is selling seven-year notes in
euros in the country’s first issue through a group of banks in
almost a month.  The notes may be priced at 83 basis points to 87 basis
points more than the six-month euro interbank offered rate,
according to bankers involved in the transaction, who declined
to be named as the sale isn’t completed. Italy sold 6 billion
euros ($8.4 billion) of 15-year bonds Sept. 22 as the country
tapped improved demand for sovereign debt.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds instead of German bunds fell to 134 basis points, down
from a high of 185 basis points on June 8 as concern eased over
the country’s ability to repay its debt. The Italian Finance
Ministry said last month that gross domestic product will expand
more than initially expected.  The economy is anticipated to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010,
up from 1 percent predicted on May 6. Italy’s $2.3 trillion
economy expanded 0.5 percent in the three months through June as
exports supported the recovery from the worst recession in six
decades.  Italy is rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, and one
step lower at AA- by Standard & Poor’s. Banca IMI SpA,
Commerzbank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena SpA and UniCredit SpA are managing the note issue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
