The Pentagon’s main building was
struck by several bullets probably from a high-powered rifle
about 5 a.m. Washington time today and officials are looking for
the shooter, Defense Department officials said.  Pentagon  police heard five to seven rounds in the south
parking lot area, prompting officials to shut down the building
for about 40 minutes, said  Colonel David Lapan , a department
spokesman.  “There was some minor damage to the exterior of the
building but no penetration,” Lapan said. He said he doesn’t
know how many bullets hit the building.  Steve Calvery, the head of the Pentagon’s security force,
said at a later press conference that two windows “were
shattered but they were not penetrated” and investigators are
reviewing surveillance tapes for clues. The incident is
considered a “random event,” he said.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, local police and the
federal Joint Terrorism Task Force are cooperating with the
Defense Department in the investigation at the Pentagon, which
is located in Virginia, just outside of Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
