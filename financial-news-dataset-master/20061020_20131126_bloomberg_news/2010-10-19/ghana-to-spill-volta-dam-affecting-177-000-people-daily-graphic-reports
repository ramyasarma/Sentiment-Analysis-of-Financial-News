Ghana  will release water from its
Volta River dam, which supplies electricity to the country, for
the first time in 20 years starting this week, the Daily Graphic
reported.  The spillage could affect as many as 177,000 people living
along the river, the Accra-based newspaper said, citing Winfred
Tesia, a coordinator with the National Disaster Management
Organization. No reason was given for the high-water level.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
