Orpea SA, France’s largest
commercial retirement-home operator, surged to the highest level
in more than two years in Paris trading after the company
announced two acquisitions and increased its 2011 sales target.  The stock rose as much as 4.1 percent to 35.35 euros, the
highest level since Sept. 2008, and advanced 3.6 percent to
35.20 euros as of 12:09 p.m.  The company, based in the Paris suburb of Puteaux, said
today in a statement that it acquired a total of 4,866 new beds
in France and Belgium from medical property owner Philippe
Austruy for 129 million euros ($179 million). The company raised
its 2011 sales target to 1.21 billion euros from 1.1 billion
euros. Orpea also split the roles of chairman and chief
executive officer and said it would issue 3.5 million new
shares.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
