Maryland’s courts adopted a rule to
make it easier for homeowners in foreclosure proceedings to
challenge lenders’ documents that they believe are fraudulent.  The rule, approved by the Court of Appeals of Maryland
today, can shift from homeowners to lenders the burden of
proving documents are legitimate. Hundreds of inaccurate or
fraudulent affidavits have turned up in Maryland foreclosures,
 Alan Wilner , chairman of the Court’s Standing Committee on Rules
of Practice and Procedure, told the court’s six-member panel.  Governor  Martin O’Malley  had asked the court’s chief judge
to suspend  foreclosures  for 60 days to ensure people are not
wrongfully thrown out of their homes. Robert Bell, the chief
judge, said he didn’t have that authority and suggested that the
rule be changed instead.  The rules committee has been “scrambling to find a way to
deal with this national calamity,” Wilner told the panel.  Up to now, the courts have assumed the accuracy of the
affidavits. Now, when asked by the court, the plaintiffs seeking
foreclosure will be required to show why the affidavit shouldn’t
be thrown out, ensuring only “genuine and valid” documents are
used, according to Wilner’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
