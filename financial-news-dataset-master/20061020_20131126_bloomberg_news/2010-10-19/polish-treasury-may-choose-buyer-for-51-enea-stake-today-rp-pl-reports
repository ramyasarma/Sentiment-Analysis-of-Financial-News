Poland’s Treasury Ministry may
choose a buyer today for a 51 percent stake in Enea SA, the
country’s third-largest utility, the newspaper Rzeczpospolita
reported on its rp.pl website, without saying where it got the
information.  Price is the ministry’s main criterion for choosing between
the finalists in the bidding, GDF Suez SA and Electricite de
France SA of France, along with Poland’s Kulczyk Holding SA, the
newspaper said.   Both French utilities have set conditions for financing a
purchase of Enea, while Kulczyk Holding is the only bidder to
agree not to split up Enea after purchasing it, rp.pl reported,
quoted people close to the negotiations.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
