Austrian prosecutors recommended
that former Bawag PSK Bank Chief Executive Officer  Helmut Elsner 
should be given a new trial on charges that he misused funds and
caused 1.7 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in losses at the bank.  The findings of the court in 2008 weren’t sufficient for a
guilty conviction of Elsner, prosecutor Erich Weiss said in
arguments filed to Austria’s supreme court on Oct. 15, his
spokesman, Wilfried Seidl said in a telephone interview today.  Elsner, 75, and his fund manager  Wolfgang Flottl , 55, were
the most prominent among nine men convicted in 2008 of charges
including improper use of funds, fraud and false accounting. The
losses were discovered in 2006 after U.S. futures broker  Refco 
Inc. collapsed into bankruptcy.  “We recommend nullifying the verdicts and sending them
back to the first court” for a retrial, Weiss said. “The
findings were not sufficient for a guilty verdict” on several
counts for Elsner and all counts for Flottl, Seidl said.  Austria’s supreme court has scheduled two days starting
Dec. 22 to discuss the case, court spokesman Ronald Rohrer said.
The court isn’t bound by the prosecutors’ recommendation.  Elsner’s lawyer, Wolfgang Schubert, wasn’t immediately
available for a comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
