The dollar may recoup October’s
losses against the Canadian currency after registering a
“morning star” reversal chart pattern, according to UBS AG.  The greenback may gain by as much as 3.3 percent versus the
loonie, which rose past parity last week, said  Taso Anastasiou ,
a technical strategist in Zurich at UBS, the world’s second-
largest currency trader. Investors should buy the dollar this
week when it dips toward support at C$1.0080, after the pair
confirmed a morning star reversal on Oct. 15, Anastasiou said.  “Momentum is bullish, so the pattern is a strong one,”
Anastasiou wrote in a research note dated today. The dollar
“confirmed a low at C$0.9981 last Thursday, and the outlook
from here calls for a bounce to C$1.0379 initially, and
potentially C$1.0509 thereafter.”  The dollar has weakened 1.2 percent against the loonie this
month and reached C$0.9981 on Oct. 14, the least since April 26.
It traded at C$1.0169 as of 9:25 a.m. in Tokyo from C$1.0172 in
New York yesterday.  A morning star is a pattern on a candlestick chart caused
by three candle formations. Traders use it as an indication a
downtrend, in this case the decline of the greenback, is about
to reverse. The dollar would need to decline below C$0.9981 for
the current signal to be negated, Anastasiou wrote.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
