NYSE Euronext Chief Executive
Officer  Duncan Niederauer  said regulators will probably respond
to the May 6 stock-market crash by extending obligations to buy
and sell shares to more traders.  Niederauer, speaking in Washington today, said too many
traders reap the benefits of making markets without
responsibilities to keep providing liquidity when stocks are
plunging. New rules may be in place as soon as January, he said.  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Mary Schapiro 
called on the agency in September to examine whether the loss of
“old specialist obligations” has hurt investors after measures
such as trading stocks in penny increments cut the number of
market makers. With the facilitation of trading now dominated by
hundreds of automated firms with few rules for when they must
buy and sell, the SEC is considering ways to keep the biggest
from abandoning the market at the first sign of trouble.  The May 6 rout, in which equities temporarily lost $862
billion of value, showed “the U.S. market structure was a lot
more vulnerable than we thought,” Niederauer said today at the
conference sponsored by the National Association of Corporate
Directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
