The judge overseeing the liquidation
of Bernard L. Madoff’s investment firm heard arguments on
whether investors who lost money in so-called feeder funds will
receive payments from the bankruptcy court trustee.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New York today said
he will rule later on the request by trustee Irving Picard to
deny claims of those who weren’t direct customers of Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities Inc., the firm at the center of the
world’s largest Ponzi scheme.  To contact the reporter on this story:
