Chinese banks are “in a sweet
spot” as the unexpected increase in the nation’s benchmark

interest-rate increase may lead to a decline in investment- and
speculation-driven demand for housing, the brokerage said in a
separate report by analysts including Jinsong Du.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
