Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB,
Mexico’s third-largest bank, may acquire smaller competitor  Ixe 
Grupo Financiero SAB as it seeks to strengthen its national
presence.  The banks signed a non-binding agreement to proceed with
due diligence for what they called a merger or possible
alliance,  according to separate statements issued today to
Mexico’s stock exchange. No financial terms were disclosed.
 Banorte  would absorb Ixe if any transaction occurs, Banorte said
in the statement.  “The combination of both institutions will produce
relevant synergies of costs, revenues and funding,” Ixe said in
the statement. The agreement would boost Ixe’s commercial
branches nationwide, it said.  Banorte has more than 1,100 branches, 4,800 ATM machines
and 8.3 million clients, Banorte said. It also has presence in
Texas, New Jersey, New York and California, the statement said.
Ixe has 155 branches, 85 in the Mexico City metropolitan area,
as well as a strategic alliance in credit cards with JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Banorte bought Ixe’s pension fund in June 2009, which had
312,489 clients and 5.45 billion pesos under management at the
time. Banorte’s total credit portfolio was 231.7 billion pesos
in August, according to statistics from Mexico’s  Banking and
Securities Commission , or CNBV.  Ixe is Mexico’s tenth-largest lender, with outstanding
loans of 28.5 billion pesos in August. Banorte trails BBVA
Bancomer, which has loan holdings of 545.7 billion pesos, and
Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex, with outstanding loans of 343.4
billion pesos.  Banorte fell 26 centavos, or 0.5 percent, to 48.85 pesos on
the Mexican Stock Exchange before the announcement. The bank has
a market capitalization of 98.6 billion pesos. Ixe rose 4.5
percent to 18.6 pesos, giving it a market capitalization of 14.3
billion pesos.  The transaction would require approval from CNBV.  To contact the reporters on this story:
