Brazil’s government sent two bills
to congress to allow  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  to raise its 2010
investment to 85.7 billion reais ($51 billion), Valor Economico
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The additional 6.4 billion reais would allow Petrobras to
buy a floating production, storage and offloading vessel and
production equipment for the Barracuda and Caratinga oil fields
and invest in the Urucu-Coari-Manaus gas pipeline, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
