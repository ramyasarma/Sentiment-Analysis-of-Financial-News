Platinum may decline to $1,638 an
ounce after a rally stalled this month, according to technical
analysis by Commerzbank AG, implying a 1.6 percent drop from the
current price.  The attached chart shows the metal may fall to about $1,645
an ounce, the current level of a 2008-10 trend line breached
earlier this month. The second chart shows prices may then slip
to the 61.8 percent retracement of the April-to-May decline at
about $1,638, one of the levels singled out in so-called
Fibonacci analysis.  “A retracement lower seems to be in the making,”  Axel Rudolph , a technical strategist at Commerzbank in London, said
today in a report. “We continue to believe that platinum will
find it difficult to overcome” levels of $1,730 to $1,760 an
ounce in the coming week, he said, referring to the metal’s
April and October highs.  Platinum, used mostly to make jewelry and pollution-control
devices for cars, climbed on Oct. 7 to $1,728 an ounce, the
highest price since May 14. The metal traded at $1,665.25 at
2:03 p.m. in London today, for a 14 percent gain this year.
Precious metals rose in recent months on speculation that the
Federal Reserve might loosen policy further to stoke U.S.
economic growth.  Commerzbank will stay bullish in the “medium term” if
prices stay above the 50 percent retracement of the April-to-May
decline at about $1,601 an ounce, which is near the June and
August highs, and above the 55- and 200-day moving averages at
about $1,600 and $1,596 respectively, Rudolph said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
