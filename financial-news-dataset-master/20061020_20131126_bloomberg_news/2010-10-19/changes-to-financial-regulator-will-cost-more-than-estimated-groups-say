Changing the way U.K. banks are
regulated will likely cost more than the government estimate of
50 million pounds ($78.6 million) and result in higher long-term
costs, two trade groups told a parliamentary committee.  Britain’s plan to abolish the Financial Services Authority
and replace it with two new regulators will result in more
senior staff, overlapping administrative duties and an overall
increase in work, Robert Sinclair, director of the Association
of Independent Financial Advisers, said today at a  Treasury
Committee  hearing in London.  “There is a danger of costs going up,” Sinclair said. “I
think the control of regulatory costs is something that there’s
still an opportunity to look at.”  Following the financial crisis, U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  in June said he would disband the
London-based FSA by 2012 and replace it with a Prudential
Regulatory Authority at the Bank of England and an industry-
financed Consumer Protection and Markets Authority. The U.K. is
also trying to reduce its debt by cutting budgets across the
government.  “We would be pleasantly surprised if it turned out to be
50 million” pounds, Steve Gazzard, the chief executive officer
of the Institute of Financial Planning, said at the hearing.  The U.K. in February 2008 had to nationalize  Northern Rock
Plc  after the lender nearly collapsed the previous year after it
suffered a run on its deposits. The government also had to take
controlling stakes in  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc .  To contact the reporter on this story:
