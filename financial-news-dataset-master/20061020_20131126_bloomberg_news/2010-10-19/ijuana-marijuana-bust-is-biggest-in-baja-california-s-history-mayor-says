Mexican authorities seized 105 tons
of marijuana bound for the U.S., representing the biggest bust
in the history of the state of Baja California, said Jorge
Ramos, the mayor of Tijuana.  No civilians were injured in the seizure made by Mexican
army and police in the border city, Ramos said. “It
was a very solid operation,” he said. “There has not been
action of this kind in the history of the state.”  Ramos said soldiers and police seized the drugs in pre-dawn
raids in three neighborhoods. The marijuana was found wrapped in
10,000 packages. The drug had an estimated street value in
Mexico of 4.2 billion pesos, about $338 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
