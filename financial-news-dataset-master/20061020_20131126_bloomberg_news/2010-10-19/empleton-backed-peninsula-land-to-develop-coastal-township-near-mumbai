Peninsula Land Ltd. , an Indian real-
estate developer backed by Franklin Templeton Investments, and
Samira Habitats, a Mumbai builder, will develop a coastal
township near the city to tap demand from the nation’s wealthy.  Peninsula  and Samira will build the township in Alibaug,
about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) south of Mumbai. Three fourths
of the project will consist of luxury residential villas and
condominiums, the companies said in a joint statement today.  Demand for luxury apartments in India is rising as record
overseas fund inflows drive Indian stocks to a 2 1/2 year high
boosting the ranks of the affluent in Asia’s third-biggest
economy. India’s wealthy may almost double their assets to $6.4
trillion over the next five years as economic growth, forecast
to expand at the fastest in three years, swells the ranks of the
rich, Credit Suisse Group AG said in its global wealth report.  Peninsula shares, which have declined 15 percent this year,
slid 0.8 percent to 65.75 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai today.  Peninsula  and  Samira  will invest 2 billion rupees ($45
million) to develop the 2 million square foot township that will
include a hotel, the companies said.  Franklin Templeton Investment’s funds own 13.9 percent as
of
Sept. 30, according to a Peninsula filing to the Bombay stock
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
