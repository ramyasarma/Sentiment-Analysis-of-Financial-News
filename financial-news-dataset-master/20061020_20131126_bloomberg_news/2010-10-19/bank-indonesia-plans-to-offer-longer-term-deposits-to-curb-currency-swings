The Indonesian central bank plans to
offer term deposits with longer maturities of three months, six
months and nine months as it seeks to reduce currency volatility
following a surge in capital inflows.  Bank Indonesia  has yet to decide when to issue the new term
deposits,  Dyah Nastiti Makhijani , a spokeswoman at the central
bank, said by telephone in Jakarta today. The current maturities
are for one and two months. Bank Indonesia’s term deposits
cannot be traded in the secondary market and investors must hold
them until maturity, Makhijani said.  Indonesia joins countries such as Brazil and South Korea in
seeking to curb currency gains as near-zero interest rates in
the U.S. and Japan spur funds to seek higher returns in emerging
markets. The rupiah has risen 5.2 percent against the dollar
this year as investors poured money into an economy where the
 benchmark interest rate  is 6.5 percent.  “Bank Indonesia is adding more instruments to absorb
excess liquidity so it won’t interfere with the rupiah,” said
 David Sumual , an economist at PT Bank Central Asia. “Now it’s a
good time for a deepening of the financial market when there is
strong capital inflow.”  Brazil yesterday raised the tax on foreign investments in
fixed-income securities to curb gains in the real.  Bank Indonesia introduced the one-month term deposit in
July and the two-month deposit in October. The deposits have
absorbed 52 trillion rupiah ($5.8 billion) of liquidity as of
the third week of October, Makhijani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
