Ten Network Holdings Ltd., 
Australia’s third-ranked commercial television broadcaster, had
stock valued at A$245 million ($242 million) traded today.  Billionaire  James Packer  hired UBS AG to acquire the stake
in Ten, the  Australian newspaper  reported today, without saying
where it got the information.  More than 163 million shares, or almost 16 percent of Ten’s
issued capital, was traded at A$1.50 a share in a so-called
special sale, according to Australian securities exchange data.
The stock closed at A$1.41 and has fallen 14 percent this year,  Jeannette McLoughlin , a spokeswoman for Sydney-based Ten,
declined to comment.  Caroline Gurney , a Sydney-based spokeswoman
for UBS, didn’t return a phone call seeking comment outside of
normal business hours. An after-hours call to  Consolidated Media
Holdings Ltd. , where Packer is deputy chairman, was diverted to
building security.  In August, Ten announced plans to team with  CBS Corp. ,
owner of the most-watched U.S. television network, to start a
digital channel in Australia for younger viewers.  The channel, known as “Eleven,” will be one-third owned
by New York-based CBS through its CBS Studios International unit
while the Australian broadcaster will own the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
