Spain is prepared to pay more for
gas from Algeria as long as the price reflects that of
international markets,  El Pais  reported, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter.  Miguel Sebastian, the minister responsible for Spain’s
industry and energy policy, and Algerian Oil Minister Youcef
Yousfi, have met twice in the past month to discuss the natural-
gas dispute between Gas Natural SDG SA and Algeria’s state-run
gas provider, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
