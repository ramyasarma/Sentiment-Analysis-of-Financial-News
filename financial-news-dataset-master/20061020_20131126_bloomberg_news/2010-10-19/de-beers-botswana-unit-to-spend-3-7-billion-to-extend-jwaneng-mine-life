Debswana Diamond Co., a joint
venture between  De Beers  and Botswana’s government, will invest
24 billion pula ($3.7 billion) to extend the life of its Jwaneng
mine, the operation’s General Manager, Balisi Bonyongo, said.  The extension, or Cut 8, is expected to extend its life by
seven years and secure another 102 million carats of diamond
production, Bonyongo said today at the mine, about 160
kilometers (100 miles) west of the capital, Gaborone.  “The project is 20 percent complete and is due for total
completion by the end of 2011, when we will be looking at the
possibility of Cut 9, another project to expand the mine,” he
said.  Diamond output in the world’s biggest producer is
recovering after falling last year because of the global
economic recession that led to Debswana temporarily closing some
mines. The southern African country may produce 24 million
carats of gems in 2010, 36 percent more than in 2009, Kgomotso
Abi, director of mining at Botswana’s Department of Mines, said
on July 27.  The extension project aims to mine 658 million metric tons
of waste material to allow for underground mining in the future,
Bonyongo said. The mine has removed about 20 million tons of
waste material, he said.  Botswana’s diamond exports declined 15 percent to 2.23
billion pula in July from a month earlier and were 16 percent
more than in the same month in 2009, the Central Statistics
Office said on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
