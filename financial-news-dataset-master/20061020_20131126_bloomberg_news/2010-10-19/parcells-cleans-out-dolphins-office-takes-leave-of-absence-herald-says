Bill Parcells  has packed up his
belongings at Miami Dolphins headquarters and is taking a leave
of absence, the Miami Herald  reported .  Parcells, 69, a consultant with the National Football
League team since relinquishing power to General Manager  Jeff Ireland  in September, doesn’t plan to seek work with another
club, the newspaper said, citing multiple unidentified team and
league sources.  Parcells, who won two Super Bowl titles as coach of the New
York Giants, feels he’s put together the blueprint for a
successful team and has talked about interests including
traveling and spending time with grandchildren, the Herald said.  Dolphins spokesman  Harvey Greene  declined to comment in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
