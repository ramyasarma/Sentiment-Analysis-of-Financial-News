Jupiter Fund Management Plc , the
U.K. money manager that first sold shares in June, said assets
under management increased 12 percent in the third quarter on
rising investment markets and inflows. The stock advanced.  Managed funds climbed to 22.2 billion pounds ($35.2
billion) on Sept. 30 from 19.8 billion pounds on June 30, the
London-based fund manager said today in a statement. The firm
didn’t provide profit figures.  “Trading conditions are in line with management
expectations and the group remains confident of its prospects
for the full year,” Jupiter said in the statement.  Jupiter has climbed 48 percent since its initial public
offering on June 16, as a 10 percent rise in the  FTSE All-Share
Index  helped increase asset values. Fund managers’ share prices
have also been boosted by several buyouts, including that of GLG
Partners Inc. by Man Group Plc and F&C Asset Management Plc’s
purchase of Thames River Capital LLP.  Of the increase in the value of its assets, 1.6 billion
pounds came from market movements during the period and 734
million pounds was due to net flows from customers.  The stock climbed 22 pence, or 8.5 percent, to 282 pence
at 10:48 a.m. in London trading, valuing the firm at about
1.3 billion pounds.  Jupiter will open a new emerging-markets fund on Nov. 1.
The Jupiter Global Emerging Markets Fund will be managed by
 Kathryn Langridge , who previously worked for Lloyd George
Management Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
