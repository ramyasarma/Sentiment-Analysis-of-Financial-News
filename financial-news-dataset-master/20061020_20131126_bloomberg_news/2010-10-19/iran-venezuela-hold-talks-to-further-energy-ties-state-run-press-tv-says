Iranian and Venezuelan officials
will hold talks today on the establishment of a joint oil
shipping company, construction of petrochemical units and the
Latin American country’s involvement in Iran’s South Pars gas
field, state-run  Press TV  said.  The setting-up of an oil shipping joint venture was agreed
in a memorandum of understanding signed between the two
countries last year, the satellite news channel said in a report
on its website.  Venezuela’s president Hugo Chavez, who arrived to Tehran
late yesterday, will attend the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
