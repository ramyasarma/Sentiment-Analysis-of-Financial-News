Serena Williams  has played her last
tennis of the year after re-tearing a tendon in her right foot,
the 13-time Grand Slam singles winner said on  her website .  Williams, 29, announced today that she re-aggravated the
injury that has kept her off the court for almost three months.
Williams withdrew from the  WTA Championships  next week in Doha,
Qatar, and next month’s Fed Cup Finals against Italy, the two
remaining tournaments to which she was committed this year. She
had a second operation to repair the tendon yesterday.  “I thank everyone for their continued support during this
difficult time and look forward with strength and determination
to getting back on the court,” Williams said.  Williams, who has more Grand Slam singles titles than any
other active woman, hasn’t played competitively since
successfully defending her Wimbledon title on July 3. The
American said she cut her foot on a shard of glass following
that victory and had surgery later that month. Williams lost her
No. 1 world ranking to 20-year-old  Caroline Wozniacki  of Denmark
on Oct. 11.  Two weeks ago, Serena’s 30-year-old sister,  Venus Williams ,
announced that a left-knee injury would keep her from competing
until 2011. Serena Williams is ranked No. 2 in the world, two
spots ahead of her sister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
