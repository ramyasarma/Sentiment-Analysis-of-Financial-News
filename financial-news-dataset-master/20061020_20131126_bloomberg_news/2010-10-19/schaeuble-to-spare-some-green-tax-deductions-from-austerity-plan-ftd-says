German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  will keep some green-tax deductions that were
earmarked for elimination as part of deficit-cutting efforts,
the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  Schaeuble had planned to recoup 1.5 billion euros ($2.1
billion) in annual revenue from the step, a figure that is part
of a 80 billion euro deficit-cutting package, said the paper,
which cited Christian Democrat budget spokesman  Norbert Barthle .  After protests from energy-intensive industries, Schaeuble
may now draw the revenue by spreading an adjusted ecology levy
across a broader cross-section of companies, the paper said. The
proposal will be discussed in Cabinet tomorrow, it stated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
