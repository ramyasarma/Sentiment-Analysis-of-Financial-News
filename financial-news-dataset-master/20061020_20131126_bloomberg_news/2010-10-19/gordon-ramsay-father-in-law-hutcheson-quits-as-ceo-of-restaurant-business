Gordon Ramsay ’s father-in-law, Chris
Hutcheson, has stepped down as chief executive officer of Gordon
Ramsay Holdings Ltd., the TV chef’s main restaurant business.  “We can confirm that Chris Hutcheson has left his position
as CEO of Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd.,” the company said today
in an e-mailed statement sent exclusively to Bloomberg. “He
retains an interest in the business as a shareholder,” it said. 
“Interim management will be put in place while the search begins
for a full-time replacement. It continues to be business as 
normal for all GRH operations.”  Hutcheson, 62, is the father of Ramsay’s wife Tana. The
statement gave no reason for Hutcheson’s departure from Gordon
Ramsay Holdings, which was incorporated on Oct. 29, 1997,
according to  Companies House . A filing for the period ended Oct.
29, 2008, showed Ramsay held 69,300 ordinary shares and
Hutcheson 29,700. The filing lists one other shareholder, Carla
Pastorino with 1,000 shares.  “We would like to thank him for all his efforts and
support in helping to build and grow GRH over the last 12
years,” the statement said.  Ramsay , 43, has restaurants in the U.K., U.S., Australia,
Doha, Dubai, France, Ireland, Italy and Tokyo. He holds a total
of 11 Michelin stars, behind  Joel Robuchon , who has 26, and
 Alain Ducasse , with 18.  ( Richard Vines  is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
