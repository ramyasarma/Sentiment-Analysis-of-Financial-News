VIA Rail Canada is resuming its
Toronto-Montreal service today after a  Canadian National Railway
Co.  derailment yesterday in eastern Ontario forced trains to
detour through Ottawa, a company spokeswoman said.  “We expect regular service to resume early this afternoon
at about 2 p.m.,” VIA spokeswoman Ashley Doyle said by
telephone.  The first trains would leave Toronto and Montreal at about
3:30 p.m., Doyle said.  Eighteen freight cars derailed near Cobourg, about 120
kilometers (75 miles) east of Toronto, and leaked about 20
pounds of sodium cyanide pellets that were cleaned up by mid-
afternoon, CN spokesman  Jim Feeny  said. There were no injuries.
The derailment’s cause is under investigation, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
