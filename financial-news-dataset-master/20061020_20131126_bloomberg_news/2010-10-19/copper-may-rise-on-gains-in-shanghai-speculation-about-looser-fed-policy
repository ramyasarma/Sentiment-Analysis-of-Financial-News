Copper may rise in London after
prices climbed to a 27-month high in Chinese trading amid
speculation that the Federal Reserve might loosen policy further
in an effort to stoke U.S. economic growth.  Copper for January delivery reached the highest intraday
level since July 2008 in Shanghai today. Raw materials will
rally if the Fed eases policy next month, UBS AG said, calling a
second round of so-called quantitative easing a “game changer”
for copper. Fed policy makers meet next on Nov. 2-3.  “Strong prices in Shanghai and expectations of
quantitative easing by the Fed starting in November” may help
to lift prices, said  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt. Monetary easing “might give a boost to the
U.S. economy and provide more liquidity to markets,” he said.  Copper for delivery in three months added $2 to $8,445 a
metric ton at 10:12 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange. The
contract touched $8,492, the highest intraday price since July
7, 2008. December-delivery copper fell 0.2 percent to $3.846 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  Additional Fed measures to boost the world’s largest
economy would increase capital flows to emerging markets,
reinforcing commodity-intensive growth, UBS said in a note to
clients today that summarized a commentary from Oct. 18.  Slumping Dollar  Speculation about further Fed easing has weighed on the
dollar, which last week posted a fifth weekly retreat as
measured by the U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength. A weaker dollar stokes demand for
commodities as an alternative investment and makes raw materials
priced in the currency cheaper in terms of other monies.  LME copper has advanced 5.4 percent this month as the
dollar index slumped 1.8 percent. Today the index climbed as
much as 0.7 percent.  Figures due today at 1:30 p.m. London time may show that
builders in the U.S. broke ground on 580,000 homes at an annual
rate in September, down 3 percent from August. A drop would be
the first since June, backing the case for the U.S. central bank
to expand measures to protect the economic recovery.  The report is “likely to show that the housing sector
continues to work off the excess inventory built up over the
2003-07 period,” said  David Thurtell , a Citigroup Inc. analyst
in London.  Higher Estimates  Construction accounts for a quarter of copper demand,
according to the Copper Development Association. The U.S. is the
world’s second-biggest copper consumer after China.  HSBC Holdings Plc raised 2011 and 2012 estimates for
copper, saying “continued strength” across Asia will offset
weakness in developed economies and support commodity prices.
Prices may average $3.26 a pound ($7,188 a ton) in 2011 and
$2.85 in 2012, up 16 percent and 19 percent, respectively, from
earlier estimates, analysts including  Daniel Kang  wrote in a
report yesterday.  The bank also increased estimates for prices of aluminum,
nickel and zinc.  LME copper stockpiles slipped 0.1 percent to 369,950 tons,
the lowest level since Oct. 26, 2009, exchange figures showed.
Orders to draw copper from LME inventories, or canceled
warrants, eased 2.2 percent to 22,200 tons.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME added 0.2 percent
to $26,700 a ton. Prices reached a record $27,338.50 on Oct. 14.
The metal has jumped 57 percent this year, leading advances on
the exchange, after production was disrupted in Indonesia and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Aluminum added 0.6 percent to $2,425 a ton and nickel rose
0.9 percent to $24,030 a ton. Lead gained 1.3 percent to $2,470
a ton and zinc climbed 1.4 percent to $2,457.75 a ton.  To contact the reporter on the story:
