The Polish zloty extended its drop
against the euro and Hungary’s forint slumped to its weakest in
three weeks after China unexpectedly raised its interest rates,
hurting investor demand for riskier assets.  The zloty slid 0.8 percent, the most among more than 20
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, to 3.9545 per
euro at 3:30 p.m. in Warsaw. The forint traded down 0.6 percent
at 277.93 in Budapest, its weakest level since Sept. 28.  European stocks and oil fell and the dollar gained the most
in six weeks against the euro after China raised its benchmark
lending and deposit rates for the first time since 2007, while
Apple Inc. forecast profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  “The initial knee-jerk reaction to the China 25 basis-
point rate hike has been to sell risk,” RBC Capital analysts
led by Toronto-based  Nick Chamie  wrote in an e-mail. “Very easy
Chinese monetary conditions have been one of the primary drivers
for global asset demand, including commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
