Bank of America Corp.  lost a bid to
appeal a Hong Kong court’s order that a former trader’s lawsuit,
claiming she was fired so the bank wouldn’t have to pay a bonus,
should go to trial.  Hong Kong Court of Appeal Judge  Maria Yuen  today rejected
the bank’s argument that its former employee  Sunny Tadjudin 
should have sued under a different law.  Tadjudin, who is seeking at least HK$10.9 million ($1.4
million) in damages, also won in June when the same court
overturned an earlier  dismissal  of her claim. Bank of America’s
Hong Kong-based spokesman  Mark Tsang  then said the bank was
confident the claim will be held to be without merit.  Tsang declined to say today whether the bank will appeal
further.  Tadjudin, who worked for the bank’s distressed debt trading
group from June 2000 to August 2007, claims her former manager
had made false accusations against her in order to fire her and
earn a higher bonus himself. She declined to comment on her case
or today’s ruling.  The case is Tadjudin Sunny and Bank of America, National
Association, CACV173/2009 in Hong Kong’s Court of Appeal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
