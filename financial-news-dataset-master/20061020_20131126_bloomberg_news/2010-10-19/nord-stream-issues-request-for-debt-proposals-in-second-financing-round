Nord Stream AG has issued banks a
request for proposals to raise debt in a second round of
financing for the venture’s planned natural-gas pipeline from
Russia to Germany.  The OAO Gazprom-led venture expects to procure a total of
2.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion) with a combination of at least
1.7 billion euros in syndicated loan facilities covered by Italy
and Germany’s export credit guarantee agencies as well as
Germany’s loan guarantee program and as much as 1 billion euros
with an uncovered syndicated loan facility, Nord Stream said
today in a statement on its Website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
