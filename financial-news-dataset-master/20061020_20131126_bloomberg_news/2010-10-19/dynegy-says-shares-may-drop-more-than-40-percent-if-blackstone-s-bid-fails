Dynegy Inc.  said its shares may fall
by more than 40 percent if stockholders reject a $540 million
bid by the Blackstone Group LP.  Dynegy, based in Houston, said in a  presentation  today its
share price may fall below $2.78, where it was trading before
Blackstone announced its bid in August. The company repeated its
recommendation that shareholders vote to approve the $4.50-a-
share offer from New York-based Blackstone, which includes the
assumption of $4.16 billion in Dynegy debt.  Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , holder of 10 percent of
Dynegy, said on Oct. 12 that the Blackstone bid wasn’t adequate.  Dynegy considered selling assets instead of agreeing to the
Blackstone takeover and determined it wasn’t possible due to
constraints related to its debt, according to a letter it sent
to shareholders today. The company forecasts “materially
worse” negative cash flow for 2011 to 2015 due to a decline in
commodity prices, according to the presentation.  Dynegy fell 8 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $4.77 at 9:32 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
