A lead group of lawyers will get
$315.3 million for doing most of the work on lawsuits against
 Merck & Co.  over its Vioxx painkiller while other attorneys who
filed suits will share $1.24 billion, a judge ruled.  Lawyers who worked for the so-called common benefit of the
plaintiffs in thousands of lawsuits against Merck deserve 6.5
percent of the $4.85 billion settlement, less than the 8 percent
they initially sought, said U.S. District Judge  Eldon Fallon  in
New Orleans.  Fallon said in August 2008 that lawyers who sued could
collect as much as 32 percent of the  settlement . The judge ruled
yesterday that the $315.3 million in common-benefit fees will
come from the total legal fees, leaving $1.24 billion for other
lawyers who sued Merck.  “The tension in this case is between the attorneys who have
done common benefit work and the primary attorneys who have
not,” Fallon ruled. “The undeniable fact remains that the great
bulk of the work as well as the expense was borne by the
attorneys who performed common benefit work.”  The lawyers doing common-benefit work billed for 562,944
hours at 109 law firms, according to the judge. They took more
than 2,000 depositions, reviewed more than 50 million documents,
briefed and argued more than 1,000 motions, conducted trials
around the U.S., and negotiated a settlement, Fallon ruled.  The lawyers outside the common-benefit group include those
who filed suits on behalf of individual clients.  Won 11 Trials  Merck  won 11 of 16 Vioxx suits at trial before agreeing in
2007 to settle all claims.  The settlement, announced in November 2007, resolved almost
50,000 claims of Vioxx users who blamed the drug for heart
attacks, strokes and lesser injuries.  Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, settled
after battling plaintiffs who claimed in state and federal
courts that it didn’t adequately disclose Vioxx safety data to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, didn’t properly warn
doctors and patients of the drug’s risks, and misrepresented the
potential harm in marketing materials.  The company reserved $1.9 billion for legal fees.  “The victims got representation for a significant fraction
of what Merck paid to its lawyers to fight responsibility,”
said plaintiffs attorney  Mark Lanier , who won a $253 million
jury verdict that was cut to $26.1 million on appeal. Lanier is
a member of the common-benefit group.  Fallon has overseen Vioxx lawsuits since February 2005
through a process known as multidistrict litigation.  The case is Vioxx Products Liability Litigation, MDL-1657,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
