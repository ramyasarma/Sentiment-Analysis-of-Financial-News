China should “tolerate” slower
economic growth as the country needs to adjust the structure of
its economy after 30 years of high growth, Zhu Baoliang, chief
economist for the State Information Center, wrote in the
People’s Daily’s overseas edition today.  China’s economy may slow next year and in the second half
of this year, Zhu wrote. The nation needs to make efforts to
expand domestic demand and stablize overseas demand so as to
keep economic growth at a stable level, Zhu wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
