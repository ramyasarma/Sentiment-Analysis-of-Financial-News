The Texas Rangers scored six ninth-
inning runs to beat the New York Yankees 8-0 and take a 2-1 lead
in the American League Championship Series.  It’s the fourth win on the road for Texas this postseason
and comes two days after the Rangers won a Major League Baseball
playoff game at home for the first time in the franchise’s 50-
year history.  Cliff Lee shut down the Yankees to join Orlando Hernandez
and Orel Hershiser as the only pitchers to win their first seven
postseason decisions. The result means Yankees starter Andy
Pettitte is still seeking a record-extending 20th postseason
win.  Lee has now won on six straight visits to Yankee Stadium,
including the World Series opener last year for the Philadelphia
Phillies. He won both his World Series starts in 2009 and New
York took the other four games to claim a record-extending 27th
championship.  The teams return to Yankee Stadium tomorrow for Game 4 in
the best-of-seven series. Also tomorrow, at AT&T Park in San
Francisco, the National League Championship Series resumes with
the Giants tied at one game apiece with the Phillies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
