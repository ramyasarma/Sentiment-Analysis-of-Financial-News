California is arranging to borrow
about $6 billion in a bridge loan from one or more Wall Street
banks this month, said state Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  Lockyer spoke in an interview with Bloomberg Television on
the sidelines of a Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles.
Last month, he said the state was lining up a loan of more than
$5 billion amid a record-long budget impasse.  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the
state’s $87 billion budget into law on Oct. 8, closing a gap of
about $19 billion. The agreement came 100 days after the start
of the fiscal year, the longest period ever in which the state
operated without a budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
