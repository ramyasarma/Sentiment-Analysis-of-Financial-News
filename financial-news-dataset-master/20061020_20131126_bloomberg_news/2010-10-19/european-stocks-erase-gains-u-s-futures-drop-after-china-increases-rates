European stocks erased their advance
and U.S. index futures declined as China raised its one-year
lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped less than 0.1 percent to
266.45 at 12:07 a.m. in London, having earlier risen as much as
0.3 percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.4
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
