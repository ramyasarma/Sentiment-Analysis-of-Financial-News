Brookfield Infrastructure Partners
LP  raised by A$42.2 million ($41.7 million) its bid to buy the
60 percent of  Prime Infrastructure Group  it doesn’t already own.  Prime investors will receive an additional A$0.20 a
security in cash from Bermuda-based Brookfield, its biggest
shareholder, to be paid as a special distribution, the two
companies said in a statement today.  Brookfield announced its takeover proposal on Aug. 23,
offering Prime shareholders 0.24 of its shares for each security
they held, sending the target’s shares surging by the most in a
year. The bid valued Prime at A$1.6 billion, or A$4.60 a share,
based on Brookfield’s closing  price  on Aug. 20, they said at the
time.  The addition of the cash component represents a 33 percent
premium to Prime’s share price before Brookfield made the offer
for the Sydney-based owner of infrastructure assets. The new
offer raises the bid to A$5.21 per share based on Brookfield’s
closing price yesterday, the companies said.  Prime shares rose 6.3 percent to A$4.89 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of trading in Sydney, their highest since Nov. 9.  About 40 percent of Prime’s largest shareholders support
Brookfield’s plan, the companies said.  The backing “reflects positively on the merits of the
transaction,” Prime Chairman David Hamill said in today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
