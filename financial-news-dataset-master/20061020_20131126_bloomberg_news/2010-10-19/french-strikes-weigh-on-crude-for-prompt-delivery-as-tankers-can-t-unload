Crude for immediate loading in the
Mediterranean and Northwest Europe declined relative to futures
contracts as strikes halted deliveries of oil to refineries
across France.  As many as 47 crude-oil and oil-product tankers were
stranded at the port of Marseille, unable to discharge as a
strike by port workers continues into a third week.  “Prompt crude oil discounts are widening dramatically on a
daily basis as the strike gets more serious,”  Philip Wiper , a
director at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London, wrote in a report
today.  North Sea  Forties  crude for loading in 10 to 21 days was 51
cents less than Dated Brent today, the biggest discount since
June 3. Forties is a blend of oil from about 70 fields in the
central part of the North Sea.  Russian  Urals  crude for delivery in Italy traded at a
discount of $1.75 a barrel to Brent, the least since Aug. 13,
according to Bloomberg data.  As many as 11 refineries in France have been halted or have
reduced their processing rates, pushing up fuel prices. So-
called cracks, which measure the difference between oil product
and crude prices and is a gauge of refining profit, have
“pushed up sharply” in the last two weeks, according to PVM.  Gasoline’s premium to Brent widened to $5.45 a barrel
yesterday, the most since Aug. 31, according to PVM data on
Bloomberg. It narrowed to $4.85 a barrel today.  The spread between the first month and second month
European  gasoline barge swaps  widened to the most in 14 months.
It was at minus $26 on Oct. 15 and at minus $11 yesterday
compared with minus $30.50 on Aug. 11, 2009.  Naphtha Premium  Demand for  naphtha  is also rising, trading at a premium to
Brent since Oct. 15, the first time since March. Naphtha, used
to make gasoline and petrochemicals, was 50 cents a barrel more
expensive than Brent crude today, compared with a discount of $2
a barrel at the beginning of the month.  Naphtha consumption typically gains before the northern
hemisphere’s winter as petrochemical makers stop using liquefied
petroleum gas as an alternative feedstock because of the
increased need for LPG as a heating fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
