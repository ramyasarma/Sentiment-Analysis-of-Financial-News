European  construction output  fell
for a second month in August, led by declines in Germany, the
Netherlands and Spain.  Construction  in the 16-nation euro region dropped 0.4
percent from July, when it slumped 3.2 percent, the European
Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg said today. From a year
earlier,  output  fell 8.5 percent. In the 27-member European
Union, construction output rose 0.3 percent in August from the
previous month.  Construction in Spain, which is working through an excess
of empty homes following a decade-long building boom, slipped
1.8 percent from July, today’s report showed. In the
Netherlands, output dropped 2.6 percent, while in Germany, it
fell 0.4 percent. French production declined 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
