Billionaire  Warren Buffett  raised
his stake in Germany’s Munich Re to more than 10 percent and
said he may buy more shares in the world’s largest reinsurer.  Buffett’s stake in Munich Re totaled 10.028 percent of
voting rights as of Oct. 11, moving beyond a threshold at which
investors have to disclose their holdings, the Munich-based
company said in a statement today. He owns the stake through
U.S. reinsurer  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , National Indemnity Co.
and OBH LLC.  The investment “serves the purpose of making trading
profits and not of implementing strategic objectives,” Munich
Re said in the statement. Further voting rights may be bought
within the next 12 months, according to Munich Re.  Munich Re has resumed plans to buy back as much as 1
billion euros ($1.4 billion) of its own shares by the 2011
shareholders’ meeting to woo investors, including Buffett, who
also owns a stake in Munich Re rival Swiss Reinsurance Co.  Munich Re shares climbed 1.1 percent to 108.35 euros as of
10:06 a.m. in Frankfurt trading, giving the company a market
value of about 20.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
