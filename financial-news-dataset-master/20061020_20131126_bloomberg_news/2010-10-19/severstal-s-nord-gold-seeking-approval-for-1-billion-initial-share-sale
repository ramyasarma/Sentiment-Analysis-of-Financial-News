OAO Severstal’s gold-mining unit is
seeking regulatory approval for a $1 billion initial public
offering in London, according to three people with knowledge of
the plan.  The IPO, managed by  Credit Suisse Group AG ,  Morgan Stanley 
and Troika Dialog, may start as early as this month, pending
approval from regulators in London, two of the people said,
declining to be identified because the information is private.
The gold unit, Nord Gold NV, will be valued at $4 billion to $5
billion after the sale, the people said.  The IPO, if successful, would be London’s biggest since  Nathaniel Rothschild ’s mining fund Vallar Plc raised $1 billion
in July. The sale would also be the largest overseas share
offering by a Russian company since Moscow-based United Co.
Rusal raised $2.24 billion in  Hong Kong  in January.  Sergey Loktionov, a spokesman for Severstal Resources,
declined to comment.  Nord Gold may produce 640,000 ounces to 670,000 ounces of
the precious metal in 2010, up from 528,700 ounces last year,
Severstal said Sept. 14. The unit’s first-half earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 41 percent to
$156 million, while sales gained 61 percent to $301 million.  Severstal has spent about $1.2 billion on gold acquisitions
since 2007, the company said in a presentation in July. Gold
operations accounted for 10 percent of overall Ebitda in the
first half.  Mail.ru Group Ltd., a Russian internet holding company
part-owned by billionaire Alisher Usmanov, also plans a  London 
IPO by the end of the year, it said in a filing this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
