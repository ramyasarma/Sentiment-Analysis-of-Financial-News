NetSpend Holdings Inc. , the provider
of reloadable prepaid debit cards that delayed its initial
public offering last week, raised $204 million after pricing its
IPO at the middle of the forecast range. The shares climbed.  The company sold 18.5 million shares for $11 each yesterday
after offering them for $10 to $12 each, according to a
statement from Austin, Texas-based NetSpend and a Securities and
Exchange Commission  filing . Separately,  ShangPharma Corp. , a
Shanghai-based pharmaceutical company, raised $87 million
selling American depositary receipts, Bloomberg data show.  NetSpend’s IPO was pushed back after  Meta Financial Group
Inc.’s  MetaBank, which issues 71 percent of NetSpend’s debit
cards, said the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision found that it
had engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices with its
iAdvance line of credit program.  Green Dot Corp. , the largest
U.S. provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards, has rallied 42
percent since its $189 million  initial offering  in July.  “It does show the quality of the opportunity there,” said
 Timothy Cunningham , a manager at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based
Thornburg Investment Management, which had $56 billion in assets
as of June 30. “I would have expected, given the concerns on
MetaBank, for it to come in below or possibly get pulled.”  Nasdaq Trading  NetSpend  advanced 17 percent to $12.83 at 10:36 a.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  in New York, Bank of America Corp.
of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chicago-based William Blair &
Co. led the offering. Oak Investment Partners planned to cut its
stake in NetSpend to 39 percent from 47 through the offering,
the SEC filing showed.  Meta Financial  has tumbled 56 percent since the Storm Lake,
Iowa-based lender said in an SEC filing that the Office of
Thrift Supervision had required MetaBank to discontinue its
iAdvance program. NetSpend owns about 5 percent of the
outstanding equity interests in Meta Financial, filings show.  ShangPharma  sold 5.8 million ADRs at $15 each yesterday,
within the forecast price range of $14.50 to $16.50, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg and SEC filings. The shares fell
 6.8 percent  to $13.98 in New York Stock Exchange trading.  TAL Education Group  of Beijing, which offers after-school
tutoring services, will offer 12 million ADRs for $8 to $10 each
today after companies from China posted three of the four
biggest gains among U.S. IPOs in 2010.  Economic Forecasts  China’s economy will grow 9.6 percent in 2011, according to
estimates from the Washington-based International Monetary Fund.
That compares with 2.2 percent for developed nations and 2.3
percent forecast for the U.S.  Bravo Brio Restaurant Group Inc. , the Columbus, Ohio-based
Italian restaurant chain operator, will sell 8.3 million shares
at $14 to $16 each tomorrow.  Vera Bradley Inc. , the Fort Wayne, Indiana-based women’s
accessory retailer, will offer 11 million shares at $14 to $16
each on Oct. 21.  Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc. , the Bridgewater,
New Jersey-based biopharmaceutical company that develops drugs
treating lipid disorders, will sell 4.7 million at $14 to $16
the same day, SEC filings and data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
