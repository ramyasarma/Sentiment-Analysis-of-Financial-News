Mauritius’s central bank signed an
agreement with the  International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development  to manage part of its foreign-currency reserves.  The IBRD, a unit of the World Bank, will give the central
bank technical advice, help improve its investment operations
and manage certain assets, the Port Louis-based Bank of
Mauritius said in a statement posted on its website today. The
agreement follows talks with the World Bank’s sovereign
investment partnerships department since 2008 on how to increase
the return on its reserves, it said.  The partnership program manages a pool of $90 billion of
assets on behalf of about 33 central banks, government bodies
and international institutions, together with the World Bank’s
own funds, Mauritius’s central bank said. It didn’t say how much
of its reserves will be managed by the World Bank.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s foreign-exchange reserves
rose 7 percent to $2.47 billion in September, the Bank of
Mauritius said on Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
