U.S. stocks tumbled, dragging
benchmark indexes to their biggest drop since August, amid
concern banks will be forced to buy back soured mortgages and
after Apple Inc. forecast profit that missed analyst estimates.  Bank of America Corp.  slid 4.5 percent after people
familiar with the matter said Pacific Investment Management Co.,
 BlackRock Inc.  and the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  seek to
make it repurchase loans packaged into $47 billion of bonds.
 Apple  retreated 2.7 percent.  International Business Machines
Corp.  lost 3.4 percent following a decline in new contracts.
Exxon Mobil Corp. led energy companies lower as oil slipped.  The S&P 500 Index lost 1.6 percent to 1,165.90 at 4 p.m. in
New York, the biggest slide since Aug. 19. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell 165.07 points, or 1.5 percent, to
10,978.62, while the Nasdaq-100 Index, of which Apple makes up
21 percent, dropped 1.6 percent to 2,069.73.  “Wall Street is measuring in real time lenders’ loan
losses from the mortgage crisis,” said  Chad Morganlander , a
Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus,
which oversees $90 billion. “This additional overhang from the
housing debacle is going to keep the financial stocks at bay for
a long period of time.”  Stock futures extended losses after China’s central bank
lifted one-year lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points.
The increases come as the fastest-growing major economy seeks to
prevent real-estate bubbles after record price gains this year.  Five-Month High  U.S. stocks rose yesterday, pushing the  S&P 500  to a five-
month high, after Citigroup Inc.’s earnings topped estimates and
an unexpected drop in industrial production added to signs the
Federal Reserve will boost government debt purchases to help
fuel the recovery. Of the 47 companies in the S&P 500 that have
posted results since Oct. 7, 39 have beaten analysts’ per-share
earnings estimates, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of America slid 4.4 percent to $11.80, erasing an
earlier gain of 0.9 percent. A bondholder group wrote to Bank of
America and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the debt’s trustee,
citing alleged failures by the bank’s Countrywide Financial
Corp. unit to service the loans properly, their lawyer had said
yesterday in a statement that didn’t name the firms.  Apple  dropped 2.7 percent to $309.49, breaking 10 straight
days of gains, after the company said profit will be about $4.80
a share in the current period including the year-end holiday
shopping season. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted
profit of $5.03.  Energy Stocks Drop  A measure of  energy  stocks fell the most among 10
industries in the S&P 500, losing 2.4 percent after crude oil
tumbled the most in seven weeks. China’s rate increase may crimp
demand in the world’s biggest consumer of energy. Exxon Mobil,
the largest U.S. oil company, retreated 1.8 percent to $65.12.  An  index  of financial stocks in the S&P 500 slipped 1.4
percent. The gauge had increased 0.6 percent earlier as  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.  led a rally in bank stocks after reporting
third-quarter profit that beat estimates.  Goldman Sachs gained 2 percent to $156.72. The U.S. bank
that makes more money from trading than any of its competitors
beat analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit amid lower
costs and higher investment-banking revenue. Net income in the
three months ended Sept. 30 was $2.98 per share, compared with
an average  estimate  of $2.29, according to a Bloomberg survey of
20 analysts.  IBM  lost 3.4 percent to $138.03 as the biggest computer-
services provider reported a 7 percent decline in services
signings to $11 billion in the third quarter. IBM’s service
business accounts for almost 60 percent of annual sales and more
than 40 percent of profit.  The shares retreated even as IBM boosted its full-year
profit forecast to at least $11.40 a share and reported earnings
and sales for the period that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Infinera’s Forecast  Infinera Corp. plunged 36 percent to $7.95. The maker of
high-speed computer networking equipment forecast adjusted per-
share earnings in the fourth quarter of 5 cents at most, falling
short of estimates for 9 cents. The company also said  Jagdeep Singh , its executive chairman, is resigning.  Stifel Nicolaus & Co. equity analyst  Sanjiv Wadhwani  cut
Infinera to “hold” from “buy.”  Other makers of fiber-optic equipment fell, with  JDS
Uniphase Corp.  retreating 6 percent to $11.40 and  Oclaro Inc. 
tumbling 16 percent to $14.09.  Microsoft Corp. , the world’s largest software company,
slipped 2.8 percent to $25.10 after the company said Chief
Software Architect  Ray Ozzie , an executive once considered an
heir to co-founder  Bill Gates , will step down. The announcement
marks the third resignation of a senior executive in less than
five months.  VMware Tumbles  VMware Inc. tumbled 6.7 percent to $73.12. The biggest
maker of programs that let computers run multiple operating
systems reported third-quarter total deferred  revenue  of $1.51
billion, falling short of some estimates.  A system upgrade at NYSE Euronext’s electronic Arca stock
market triggered what appeared to be a 9.6 percent plunge
yesterday in an  exchange-traded fund  that tracks the S&P 500, a
drop that would have erased $7.9 billion from one of the most
popular securities in the U.S.  Data published by the electronic venue at 4:15 p.m. New
York time showed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust at  $106.46 , compared
with its opening level of $117.74. The prices were later voided
and the closing price updated to $118.54, up 0.7 percent,
exchange officials said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
