The likelihood that Group of 20
nations will reach an accord to avert a “currency war” has
risen, BNP Paribas SA said.  “The chance of an agreement has increased as the
International Monetary Fund uses its influence to convince G-20
participants that an agreement is a must,” a team of foreign-
exchange analysts led by  Hans-Guenter Redeker  in London wrote in
a note to clients today.  The size of asset purchases that may be announced by the
U.S. Federal Reserve next month will “tell us a lot about the
motivation of the U.S. side to reach out to China to avoid a
currency war,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
