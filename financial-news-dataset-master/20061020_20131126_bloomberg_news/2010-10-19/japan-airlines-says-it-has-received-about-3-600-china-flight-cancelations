Japan Airlines Corp.  and  All Nippon
Airways Co. , the nation’s two biggest carriers, said travelers
had canceled about 11,100 trips on China flights amid rising
political tensions.  ANA had about 7,500 cancellations between Sept. 17 and Oct.
12,  Megumi Tezuka , a spokeswoman, said by phone from Tokyo
today. About 3,600 JAL trips were axed including about 3,000
from Japan, President  Masaru Onishi  told reporters at a press
event.  JAL may consider paring flights or using different planes
on China flights because of the reduction in demand, Onishi
said. Demonstrators in both countries staged rallies at the
weekend over rival claims to uninhabited islands in the East
China Sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
