Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat
importer, bought 290,000 metric tons of the grain grown in the
U.S., Canada and France in a tender.  The state-run General Authority for Supply Commodities
purchased two 55,000-ton cargoes of U.S. soft red winter wheat
at $279.80 a ton from Perdue, Vice Chairman Nomani Nomani said
today from Cairo. It also bought two 60,000-ton cargoes of
French grain at $296.06 a ton from Invivo and 60,000 tons of
Canadian wheat at $282.75 a ton from Louis Dreyfus.  The grain, purchased without the cost of freight, is for
shipment from Dec. 21 to Dec. 31, Nomani said.  Egypt buys between 5 million and 6 million tons of wheat a
year through international tenders because local production is
insufficient to meet demand in the Arab world’s most populous
nation, which has about 80 million people. The wheat is used in
a subsidized bread program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
