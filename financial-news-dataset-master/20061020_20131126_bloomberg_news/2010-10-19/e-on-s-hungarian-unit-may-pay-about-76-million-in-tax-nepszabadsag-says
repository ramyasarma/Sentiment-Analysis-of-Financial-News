E.ON  AG’s Hungarian subsidiary
expects to pay about 15 billion forint ($75.5 million) under a
“crisis tax” levied by the Hungarian government on energy
companies,  Nepszabadsag  said, citing the unit’s spokesman Istvan
Kutas.  The revenue-based tax is “highly uncomfortable” for the
company as a number of the firm’s activities yield minimal
profit or are loss-making, Kutas told the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
