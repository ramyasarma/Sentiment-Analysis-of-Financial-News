Woolworths Ltd. , Australia’s biggest
retailer, posted a 4.1 percent increase in first-quarter sales,
led by the company’s supermarkets.  Revenue rose to A$13.9 billion ($13.5 billion) in the three
months ended Oct. 3 from A$13.4 billion a year earlier, Sydney-
based Woolworths said in a stock exchange filing today. Sales
were expected to grow 4.5 percent, according to the median
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Woolworths and smaller rival  Wesfarmers Ltd.  are facing
slowing revenue growth amid decelerating food-price inflation
and the absence of more than A$10 billion in cash handouts to
families that boosted 2009 sales. The retailer is refurbishing
stores and lowering prices to win customers.  The company’s food and liquor sales in Australia rose 3.2
percent to A$9.3 billion in the quarter, with revenue from
stores open at least a year gaining 2 percent, matching analyst
estimates.  Grocery sales at the retailer’s New Zealand outlets
increased 4.7 percent to NZ$1.4 billion ($1 billion) on new
store formats and improved stocking of shelf inventory,
Woolworths said. When converted to Australian dollars, growth
was 2.8 percent.  Woolworths  slipped  0.3 percent to A$28.88 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of trading in Sydney. The stock has gained 3.1 percent
this year, compared with a 5 percent decline by the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index.  Consumer electronics sales rose 4.1 percent to A$481
million while the Big W discount department store chain posted a
2.7 percent drop in revenue to A$1.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
