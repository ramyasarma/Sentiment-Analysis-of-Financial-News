China should resist attempts by the
U.S. to appreciate the yuan, Zhang Monan, an economist at the
State Information Center, wrote in a commentary in the China
Daily.  The U.S. is using quantitative easing to devalue the dollar
and reduce its national debt, Zhang wrote. The “well-designed”
strategy puts pressure on emerging countries to appreciate their
currencies and stokes inflation, he wrote.  China must consider its long-term and short-term intersts
in an exchange-rate war and be psychologically prepared for a
“lengthy test,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
