The price of cocoa in Nigeria, the
fourth-largest producer, fell about 20 percent at the start of
the season because of lower international prices and speculation
output will rise in Ivory Coast, traders and farmers said.  Farm-gate prices for the chocolate ingredient ranged from
360,000 naira ($2,362) a metric ton to 370,000 naira in the two
weeks through Oct. 15, compared with about 460,000 naira a ton a
year earlier,  Abang Neji Abang , secretary general of the
country’s Cocoa Association, said by phone today from Calabar,
in southern Nigeria. Prices may improve after production from
Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa grower, didn’t rise as
much as expected, he said. The new season started on Oct. 1.  “The fact is that we have low international prices,”
Anant Patil, business manager at Olam Nigeria Limited, an
agricultural commodity trading company, said by phone from Lagos
late yesterday. “If international prices improve, farmers’
prices will also improve,” he said. Cocoa fell 17 percent in
London this year.  Nigeria ranks behind  Ivory Coast ,  Ghana  and Indonesia in
cocoa production, according to the International Cocoa
Organization. Cocoa exports are Nigeria’s biggest foreign
exchange earner after crude oil, according to figures published
the Nigerian government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
