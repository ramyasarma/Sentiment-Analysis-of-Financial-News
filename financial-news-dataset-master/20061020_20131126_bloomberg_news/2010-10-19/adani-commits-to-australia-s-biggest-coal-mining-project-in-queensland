Adani Enterprises Ltd. , India’s
biggest coal importer, said it’s committed to a A$6.9 billion
($6.8 billion) coal project in Queensland state that will be
Australia’s biggest mine producing the fuel.  “This investment has unlocked the enormous potential of
what were once unviable resources,”  Gautam Adani , executive
chairman of the Gujarat-based company, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Adani in August bought the  coal  asset for A$3 billion in
cash and royalties from Linc Energy Ltd., making it the largest
acquisition by an Indian company in Australia. The company is
targeting first coal output by the end of 2014 and production of
50 million tons to 60 million tons by 2022.  India’s thermal-coal imports almost doubled to 60 million
tons last year as the nation increased electricity generation
capacity to end blackouts and sustain an economy forecast to
grow more than 9 percent this fiscal year. India’s economy has
expanded by an annual average of 8.4 percent since 2004,
straining transport, energy and manufacturing capacity.  The project in Queensland’s Galilee basin comprises mine,
rail and port construction and is set to create between 4,000 to
5,000 jobs during construction and production, Adani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
