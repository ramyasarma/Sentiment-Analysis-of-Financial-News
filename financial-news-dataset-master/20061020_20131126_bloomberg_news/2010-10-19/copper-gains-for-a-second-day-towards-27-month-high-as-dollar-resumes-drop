Copper gained for a second day,
advancing towards a 27-month high, as the dollar resumed a
decline, increasing the appeal of commodities as alternative
investments.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.3 percent to $8,469 a metric ton by
8:02 a.m. Singapore time. Copper reached $8,490 a ton on Oct.
14, the highest price since July 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
