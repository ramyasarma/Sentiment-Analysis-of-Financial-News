Restaurant Brands New Zealand Ltd. ,
an owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Starbucks franchises, rose the
most in a month in Wellington trading after it said first-half
profit gained 52 percent.  Net income rose to NZ$13.5 million ($10 million) in the six
months ended Sept. 13 from NZ$8.9 million a year earlier, the
Auckland-based company said in a statement. The stock rose 2.4
percent, the biggest gain since Sept. 21.  Restaurant Brands’ share price has jumped almost 54 percent
since Jan. 1, becoming the best performer on the benchmark  NZX
50 stock  index. The company increased its first-half dividend to
7 cents a share from 4.5 cents and reaffirmed that full-year
profit excluding non-trading items will rise to a range of NZ$24
million to NZ$26 million.  Second-half earnings are likely to match the year earlier
because “consumer sentiment is not bullish,” the company said.
The full effect of the Oct. 1 increase in sales tax and income
tax cuts has yet to work through into consumer spending.  The  stock  rose 6 cents to NZ$2.58 as at the 5 p.m. market
close in Wellington. Earlier, it climbed as much as 5.2 percent,
the biggest gain since March 4.  First-half sales rose 3.9 percent to NZ$176.6 million, the
company said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization gained 23 percent to NZ$34 million.  Sales at the company’s 87 KFC stores, which contribute 72
percent of group revenue, rose 7.5 percent. KFC’s operating
earnings increased 20 percent and are expected to grow further
in the second half, the company said. The Pizza Hut and
Starbucks units face rising input costs which may curb margin
growth, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
