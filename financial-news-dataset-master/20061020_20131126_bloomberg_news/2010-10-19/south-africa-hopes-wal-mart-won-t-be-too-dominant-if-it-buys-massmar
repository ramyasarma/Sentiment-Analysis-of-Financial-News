South African Finance Minister
 Pravin Gordhan  said he hopes  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
biggest retailer, won’t crimp competition in South Africa if it
buys  Massmart Holdings Ltd.   Wal-Mart said on Sept. 27 it plans to buy Johannesburg-
based Massmart, the country’s biggest food and general goods
wholesaler, in a transaction worth about $4.6 billion.  “Hopefully they don’t become too dominant and hopefully we
have an appropriate level of competition and if we don’t, the
authorities step in and act,” Gordhan said at conference hosted
by the Consumer Goods Council in Johannesburg today.  The government is trying to boost competition in the
economy and antitrust authorities are currently probing alleged
collusion amongst the four largest grocers, who together
accounted for 60 percent of industry sales last year. Massmart
says its purchase will boost efficiency and benefit the wider
economy.  “One deal doesn’t necessarily compromise
competitiveness,” Gordhan said.  The U.S. retailer will bring in new skills and technologies
that will “flow right through the economy,” Massmart’s Chief
Executive Officer  Grant Pattison  said at the conference today. A
takeover by Wal-Mart won’t necessarily undermine competition as
South African retailers will put up a “big fight and a big
defense,” Pattison said.  Wal-Mart is in exclusive talks with Massmart while due
diligence studies are carried out, Massmart said on Sept. 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
