Japan’s sale of 2.4 trillion yen
($29.5 billion) in five-year government bonds may have a lowest-
accepted price of 100.1, according to the median forecast of 14
traders surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 0.3 percent
notes ranged from 100.11 to 100.07, according to the survey.
Nine traders said 100.1, three said 100.11 and one trader each
reported 100.09 and 100.07.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
