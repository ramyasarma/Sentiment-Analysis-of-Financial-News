Harley-Davidson Inc. , the biggest
U.S. motorcycle maker, said third-quarter profit more than
doubled as earnings in its finance unit made up for declining
sales worldwide.  Net income rose to $88.8 million, or 38 cents a share, from
$26.5 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier, Milwaukee-based
Harley said today in a statement. The average  estimate  of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 36 cents. Revenue fell 1.9
percent to $1.09 billion, and the shares dropped 6.8 percent.  Chief Executive Officer  Keith Wandell , who has cut costs by
renegotiating labor contracts, said Harley is transforming
itself to “succeed at today’s volumes.” The financial-services
unit, which makes loans to motorcycle buyers, had operating
income of $50.9 million compared with a $31.5 million loss a
year earlier. Harley’s retail sales slid 7.7 percent.  “Motorcycle demand is slumping, and that slump has yet to
show signs of abating,” Brent Miller, an analyst with Gradient
Analytics in Scottsdale, Arizona, said in an interview. “That’s
a bit concerning. How long can a company continue to count on
its financial services arm to fill in that gap of dragging
demand?”  Harley declined $2.20 to $30.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 20
percent this year.  The new labor agreements at factories in Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin reduce jobs, give new employees fewer benefits and
will let Harley add and cut workers based on demand. The
Wisconsin contracts start in 2012.  MV Agusta  Excluding discontinued operations such as the MV Agusta
line of motorcycles, profit rose to 40 cents a share from 24
cents a year earlier.  Harley raised the low end of its production plan for this
year. It now expects to ship 207,000 to 212,000 motorcycles to
dealers, a decrease of as much as 7.2 percent from last year. In
July, it  forecast  shipments of 201,000 to 212,000, as much as a
9.9 percent decrease. Deliveries fell 27 percent last year to
223,000 from 303,500 in 2008.  Most motorcycle sales are discretionary purchases, which
consumers reduced as the economy slowed, Wandell said today.  “All of our market data and research indicates there’s
still a tremendous affinity for the brand and a desire to own
Harley-Davidson motorcycles,” Wandell said in an interview.
“It’s a matter of getting some help with the economy on top of
everything else we’re doing with our strategy.”  Harley’s U.S. retail sales in the three months ended Sept.
26 fell 9.4 percent from a year earlier. Industrywide retail
sales of heavyweight motorcycles fell 14 percent, Harley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
