The three brothers in the Kings of
Leon trace their music back to childhood, touring with their
father Ivan “Leon” Followill, a Pentecostal minister.  Living out of a purple Oldsmobile, they learned blues,
gospel songs and hellfire preaching while traveling around the
U.S. South. When Leon quit the church, the boys moved on. With
their cousin Matthew, they formed a band based in Nashville,
realizing that rock was their salvation.  While this official story of the Kings plays up their
itinerant lifestyle over the five years they settled in Jackson,
Tennessee, it suggests a base for authentic rock. “Come Around
Sundown” shows them at their most potent.  The CD is raw, like 2008’s “Only by the Night,” which
sold more than 6 million copies. Wisely, the edges haven’t been
smoothed in the name of commercialism. Stadium rockers such as
“ Radioactive ” come on like a feverish bar-room brawl with
guitars thrown in. Rating: ***.  Lil Wayne has been busy, even with a jail term to serve
after pleading guilty to gun-possession charges. “I Am Not a
Human Being” is a mini-album released to mark his Sept. 27
birthday, which the star, born Dwayne Carter, spent behind bars.  While the result isn’t on a par with the 28-year-old
rapper’s “Carter” series, the tracks are stronger than remixed
leftovers. Awaiting his next proper album, this is a serviceable
stopgap, littered with trademark sharp raps and four-letter
rants. Rating: **.  Bob Dylan’s  “The Bootleg Series Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos:
1962-1964,” released yesterday, marks the first official
appearance of demos made for the publishing companies Leeds
Music and M. Witmark & Sons.  Highlights include the civil-rights-inspired “Long Ago,
Far Away” -- a song covered by  Odetta  -- and an unusual piano
version of “Mr. Tambourine Man.” Dylan gives his all in
passionate performances. These songs were written before he
turned 24, yet their quality still impresses. Rating: ****.  Katy Perry’s  “Teenage Dream” has been topping the charts,
fired by the single “California Gurls.” The singer-songwriter,
at 25, is hardly set to match Dylan’s acclaim. Still, she can be
fun. As an antidote to many dismissive reviews, it’s worth
stating that her third CD isn’t all bad.  The outrage of “I Kissed a Girl” is replaced by yearning
numbers such as “Who Am I Living For?”  The question falls flat when you read that she’s engaged to
actor-comedian  Russell Brand . Well, the danceable disco pop
helps pull it off. Rating: ***.  The Kings of Leon CD is on RCA, Lil Wayne is on Cash Money
Records, Dylan is on Sony Legacy/Columbia and Katy Perry on
Capitol. The CDs are priced from $12.98, or 8.99 pounds in the
U.K. Download fees vary across services.  Information:  http://radioactive.kingsofleon.com/ ,
