Dutch venture capital fund  eVentures
Africa  aims to invest 20 million euros ($28 million) to invest
in mobile-based commerce systems, online markets and social
media Internet sites in sub-Saharan Africa.  Managers of the fund expect to conclude talks with South
African, Dutch and Middle Eastern investors and have the money
available by year-end, Managing Director Vincent Kouwenhoven
said yesterday in an interview in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. He
declined to name the potential investors.  “Mobile commerce in Africa isn’t just copying and pasting
what has been done in the West, it is where it’s being
innovating,” Kouwenhoven said.  Services such as Safaricom’s M-Pesa, short for mobile money
in Swahili, a cellphone-based money transfer and payment system,
shows that Africa is both spurring innovation and a growing
consumer market for new technologies, Kouwenhoven said.  The fund, which started operating in January, has invested
in six projects worth about 500,000 euros, including an Internet
payment system in Kenya known as  PesaPay , a local version of
PayPal, and Ghanaian web developer Explainer DC, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
