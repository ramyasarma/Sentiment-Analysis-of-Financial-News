UniCredit SpA ’s Libyan and Abu Dhabi
investors, which jointly own about 12.6 percent of the Italian
lender, may have legal connections that would lead the bank to
consider them as a single shareholder,  Il Messaggero  reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  UniCredit’s internal auditor, Ranieri de Marchis, is
examining if the Libyan Investment Authority and the Central
Bank of Libya, which together own about 7.6 percent of
UniCredit, are independent entities amid a regulator inquiry,
the daily said. De Marchis has found that the two investors may
be linked to Abu Dhabi’s Aabar, which owns about 5 percent of
UniCredit, through a Luxembourg fund, the newspaper said.  Voting rights of UniCredit’s shareholders are limited to 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
