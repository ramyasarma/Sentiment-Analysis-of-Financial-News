The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  is
near a level seen by technical analysts as key to sending the
equity benchmark higher, according to Bank of America Corp.  After rising above the range between 1,130 and 1,150, the
S&P 500 is poised to test the 1,220 “resistance” level,  Mary Ann Bartels , the technical analyst, wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. The benchmark closed 0.7 percent higher at 1,184.71
yesterday after Citigroup Inc.’s earnings topped estimates and
an unexpected drop in industrial production added to signs the
Federal Reserve will buy more assets to fuel the recovery.  “A sustained breakout above 1,220 would improve the
outlook and target higher levels going into 2011,” Bartels,
head of U.S. technical and market analysis at Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit, wrote. Our model “points to no
major top being formed in the equity market. Corrections should
be limited.” She recommended buying on price dips.  The  S&P 500  gained as much as 80 percent since falling to a
12-year low in March 2009 as the government spent trillions of
dollars to stimulate the economy. The index fell as much as 16
percent from a 19-month high in April on investors’ concern that
U.S. unemployment and widening budget deficits in Europe could
derail global growth. The gauge has risen 16 percent since July
2 as companies reported better-than-estimated earnings.  Technical analysts observe price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines. The
trading patterns and prices are used to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
