Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  set aside
$13.1 billion for compensation and benefits in the first nine
months of the year, down 21 percent from a year earlier, as
revenue fell 14 percent.  The amount, equal to 43 percent of revenue, is enough to
pay each of the New York-based firm’s 35,400  employees  $370,706
for nine months’ work. That’s down from an average $527,192 for
the firm’s 31,700 workers a year earlier.  Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007,
came under pressure last year from politicians and shareholders
to reduce bonuses following the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression. The company cut its full-year ratio of
compensation to revenue to 35.8 percent, the lowest since the
company went public in 1999.  “They recognize that the world has changed,” said  Brad Hintz  at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who was named the top
analyst covering brokerage firms in a survey of fund managers by
Institutional Investor magazine this year. “The only way to
improve your return on assets is to control compensation.”  Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year to pay employees, with most of the money
awarded in the form of year-end bonuses. Goldman Sachs reserved
$3.83 billion for compensation in the third quarter, or 43
percent of revenue, equal to the proportion in the first half.  Last week New York-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  reported that
it set aside 39 percent of its investment-bank’s revenue to pay
workers in the division for the first nine months of the year,
up from 38 percent a year earlier.  JPMorgan Chase  The expense at JPMorgan’s investment bank fell 10 percent
to $7.88 billion from $8.79 billion. That’s equal to $298,866
for each of the unit’s 26,373 workers at the end of September,
down from $353,834 on average for the division’s 24,828
employees a year earlier.  The following compares compensation at Goldman Sachs and
JPMorgan’s investment bank.
