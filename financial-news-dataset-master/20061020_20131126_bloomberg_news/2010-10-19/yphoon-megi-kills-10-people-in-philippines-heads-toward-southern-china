Typhoon Megi left at least 10 dead
in the Philippines, the Office of Civil Defense said as more
reports arrived.  Aside from three earlier reported deaths, three fishermen
were killed at sea off Isabela province. In Pangasinan province,
three members of a family were killed when a tree fell on them
and another person died when struck by lightning, Civil Defense
Administrator Benito Ramos told reporters in Manila.  Megi crossed northern Philippines yesterday and is now in
the South China Sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
