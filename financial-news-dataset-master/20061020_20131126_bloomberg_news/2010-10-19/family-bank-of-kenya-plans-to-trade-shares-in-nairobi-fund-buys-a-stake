Family Bank Ltd. , a provider of
small loans in Kenya, plans to start trading its shares on the
Nairobi Stock Exchange, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Kinyanjui 
said.  The listing will “unlock shareholder value” in the
company, Kinyanjui told reporters in Nairobi today, without
providing more details. Last year, the bank said it planned to
sell 42 percent of shares in an initial public offering.  AfricInvest Fund , a Fidelity Capital Partners Ltd. fund
that is based in Mauritius, bought a stake in the lender,
boosting its capital to 3 billion shillings ($37.1 million),
Family Chairman Titus Muya said today, without providing the
previous level of capital or the size of the fund’s holding in
the bank. The injection raised Family Bank’s deposit-taking
capacity to 40 billion shillings, compared with current deposits
of 15 billion shillings, he said.  “Our new partners have agreed that they will provide
grants to strengthen our human and technical capacity,”
according to Muya.  With 53 outlets and 800,000 customers, Family Bank has
assets worth 19 billion shillings and issued 11 billion
shillings in loans, he said. The lender plans to open 10 more
outlets, Muya said. Family Bank, which currently has 7,000
shareholders most of who are customers and employees, is keen on
expanding within East Africa, Kinyanjui said.  Set up in 1984, the lender upgraded its status to a
commercial bank from a building society in May 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
