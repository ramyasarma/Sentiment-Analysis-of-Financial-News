German’s immigrants can only fully
participate in the country’s life by learning German, President
Christian Wulff said in an interview with Turkish newspaper
Hurriyet.  Speaking the language is the "basis for the solution of
many problems," Wulff said in an interview published in the
Istanbul-based newspaper at the start of a four-day visit to
Turkey. "Only that can open all the doors to the education
system."  Wulff said his meetings with Turkish groups in Germany
demonstrated how many people want active participation in
society, according to Hurriyet. "Still, we cannot close our eyes
to the fact that immigration to Germany has brought with it
various problems," Wulff said, according to the newpaper.  The president will address the parliament in Ankara today,
Hurriyet said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
