Heavy drinking as a  teenager  may
change brain development, affecting areas involved in judgment,
social skills and decision-making, according to a study.  Researchers determined that teenagers scored worse on a
battery of psychological tests if they were diagnosed with
substance abuse or dependence, compared with nonabusing teens,
according to a study in the journal  Alcoholism . The study also
found that the adolescents who used marijuana had significantly
poorer memory than those who didn’t.  Adolescence is a time when the brain develops rapidly and
social skills, foresight and abstract reasoning are developed,
according to previous research. Those are areas of the mind that
are consistently impaired in adult  alcoholics , according to
background material in today’s study.  “The presence of clinically significant binge drinking and
marijuana use diverts the course of normal cognitive
development,” wrote the authors, led by  Robert Thoma , a
psychiatrist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.  The study examined 19 adolescents with a diagnosis of
 alcohol abuse  or dependence who were an average of 16 years old.
They told researchers they had about 13 drinks a day, on the
days they decided to drink. That group was compared with 15
teens, with an average age of 14.7 years, who had no history of
substance abuse. This group reported having an average of less
than one drink on the days they chose to drink.  To contact the reporter on this story:
