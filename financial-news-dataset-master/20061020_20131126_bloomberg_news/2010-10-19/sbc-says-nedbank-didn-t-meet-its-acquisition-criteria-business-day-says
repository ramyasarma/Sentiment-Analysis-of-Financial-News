HSBC Holdings Plc said that South
Africa’s Nedbank Group Ltd. didn’t meet the company’s “strict
acquisition criteria,” Business Day reported, citing Paul
Harris, a spokesman for HSBC.  HSBC still wants to expand in Africa by acquiring banks or
through organic growth, Harris said, according to the
Johannesburg-based newspaper.  HSBC on Oct. 15 abandoned a bid to buy as much as 70
percent of South Africa’s Nedbank from Old Mutual Plc and other
shareholders. The stake in Nebank is worth about $7.3 billion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
