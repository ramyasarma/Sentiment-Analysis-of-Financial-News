Copper declined from a 27-month high
as the dollar rebounded, damping demand for commodities as
alternative investments and as increasing prices discouraged
purchases by Chinese consumers.  The metal for three-month delivery was little changed at
$8,430.25 a metric ton at 3:01 p.m. in Singapore, after rising
as much as 0.6 percent to $8,492 a ton earlier, the highest
level since July 2008. Copper for January delivery in Shanghai
gained as much as 2 percent to 64,270 yuan ($9,669) a ton, also
the highest since July 2008, before paring the advance.  “The macroeconomic conditions are having a big influence
on metals prices,” said Fu Bin, an analyst at Jinrui Futures Co.
“The prospect of further easing in the U.S. is driving the
dollar’s direction and outlook for metals prices.”  A second round of quantitative easing by the Fed will
prolong the bull market in commodities, UBS AG said in a note. A
U.S. housing report today is expected to show builders broke
ground on 580,000 homes at an annual rate in September, down 3
percent from August. This would be the first drop since June and
back the case for the U.S. central bank to expand measures to
protect the economic recovery.  Copper, used in construction and household appliances, has
advanced 9.4 percent in the past month as the  dollar  slumped 4.9
percent against a basket of six major currencies on expectations
U.S. policy makers will cut borrowing costs to zero by January.
The dollar rose for a third day against the euro following a
slide in Asian stocks.  Chinese Demand  “Demand in China is good but not great and consumers are
buying hand-to-mouth at these price levels,” said Fu. “The
short-term fundamental picture isn’t supportive of such high
prices and we expect to see a correction soon.”  Copper stockpiles tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained for a second week to 103,510 tons, according to data
provided by the bourse. That’s the highest level since the week
ended Sept. 3. Immediate-delivery copper in Changjiang,
Shanghai’s biggest cash market, dropped for a second day
yesterday from a 27-month high of 62,900 yuan on Oct. 14.  Quantitative easing and macro drivers “buoyed copper’s
price to current highs,” UBS analysts led by Julien Garran said
yesterday. “China is short copper, but as China’s industry is
highly price sensitive, upside from here is limited.”  UBS expected copper to average $3.38 a pound ($7,453 a ton)
this year and $3.68 a pound in 2011, up 7 percent each from
previous estimates. HSBC Holdings Plc yesterday also raised its
2011 copper target by 16 percent to $3.26 a pound.  Aluminum and zinc in London were little changed at $2,410 a
ton and $2,426.50 a ton, while lead gained 0.6 percent to $2,453
ton. Nickel increased 0.7 percent to $23,970 a ton, while tin
was unchanged at $26,650 a ton by 3:04 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
