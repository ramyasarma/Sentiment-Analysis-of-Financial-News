Mexico’s peso dropped the most in
more than a month after the Chinese central bank unexpectedly
raised the benchmark lending rate as inflation accelerated to
the fastest pace in two years.  The peso fell 0.9 percent to 12.5245 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time, from 12.4095 yesterday. The decline was the
steepest since Sept. 7.  “This is a clear signal of a strategy that other central
banks may soon follow,” said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader at
Banco Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico City. “When they start to move
like this, it means there are signs of a recovery.”  China raised the one-year lending rate to 5.56 percent from
5.31 percent, the People’s Bank of China said today on its
website. Data to be released on Oct. 21 may show that inflation
rose to 3.6 percent in September, the fastest pace in almost two
years, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.351 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price rose 0.1 centavo to
133.98 centavos per peso.  Mexico will begin raising the benchmark interest rate in
September 2011, according to a survey of economists by Citigroup
Inc.’s Banamex unit. The inflation rate will be 4.3 percent at
the end of the year and the economy will grow 4.65 percent this
year, according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
