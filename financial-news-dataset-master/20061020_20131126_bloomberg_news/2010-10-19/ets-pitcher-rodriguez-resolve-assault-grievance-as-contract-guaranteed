The New York Mets and relief pitcher
Francisco Rodriguez resolved a grievance stemming from the
player’s alleged assault of the grandfather of his children
after a game this season.  Rodriguez agreed not to challenge the Mets’ withholding of
some $3.1 million from the end of his 2010 contract, according
to a statement from the Major League Baseball team. In return,
the Mets said they agreed to guarantee the rest of the
reliever’s contract and remove him from the disqualified list.  Rodriguez was placed on the list Aug. 17, six days after
injuring his thumb in the alleged assault at Citi Field, the
Mets’ statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
