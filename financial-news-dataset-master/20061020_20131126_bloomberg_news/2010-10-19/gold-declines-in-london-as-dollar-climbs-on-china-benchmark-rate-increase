Gold futures fell the most since
July as an unexpected interest-rate increase by China spurred
gains for the dollar, curbing demand for bullion as an
alternative investment.  The greenback jumped as much as 1.6 percent against a six-
currency basket. Before today, gold rallied 25 percent this
year, touching a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14, as
central banks around the world kept interest rates low to revive
the global economy.  “China reminds the world that a central bank can in fact
raise rates,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services in Chicago. “It strengthens the dollar and
slows down expansion, and will give gold a decent correction.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $28.80, or 2.1
percent, to $1,343.30 an ounce at 11:53 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. A close at that price would be the biggest decline for a
most-active contract since July 27.  China’s one-year deposit rate will rise to 2.5 percent from
2.25 percent, effective tomorrow. The lending rate will increase
to 5.56 percent from 5.31 percent. This is the first increase
for both rates since 2007.  “The Chinese have taken steps to rein in the spending and
mitigate some of the inflation,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “That’s
going to hurt any asset that’s an inflation hedge. Gold is
dropping heavy.”  Fed Policy  The Federal Reserve has kept its main lending rate between
zero percent and 0.25 percent since December 2008. Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke said last week additional monetary easing may be
warranted.  Investors have been placing record bets on gold. Open
interest, or futures contracts yet to be closed, liquidated, or
delivered, rose to 638,283 as of Oct. 14, according to data from
Comex. On Oct. 7, daily trading in gold options reached a record
102,292 contracts.  Gold will average $1,400 next year, up from a previous
forecast of $1,295, UBS AG analysts including  Edel Tully  said in
a report dated yesterday. Concerns about currency weakness and
the likelihood of quantitative easing, or asset purchases by the
Fed, will support prices, the bank said.  “We are constructive on gold until monetary policy begins
to tighten,” the UBS analysts said. “Gold’s largest hurdle
will arrive perhaps not when the U.S. initially tightens, but
will certainly intensify as interest rates move north. Then the
opportunity cost of holding gold will eat into its appeal.”  Silver futures for December delivery fell 53.3 cents, or
2.2 percent, to $23.88 an ounce. Futures reached $24.95 on Oct.
14, the highest level since March 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $17.30, or 1
percent, to $1,681 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Palladium futures for December delivery fell $5.95, or 1
percent, to $582.15 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
