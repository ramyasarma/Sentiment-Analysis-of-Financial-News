State Street Corp ., the third-
largest custody bank, said third-quarter operating profit rose
21 percent, helped by acquisitions and cost cutting.  Profit increased to $427 million, or 86 cents a share, from
$354 million, or 71 cents, a year earlier, Boston-based State
Street said today in statement. Operating revenue rose 8.4
percent while expenses climbed 3.1 percent.  State Street and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the largest
custody bank, are competing to find acquisitions and have said
the best opportunities may be in Europe. State Street completed
the purchases of Mourant International Finance Administration in
the U.K.’s Channel Islands in April and the securities-servicing
unit of Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo SpA in May.  State Street’s net income rose to $540 million, or $1.08 a
share, from $327 million, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Earnings
included a gain of $189 million, or 23 cents a share, from the
sale or maturing at face value of fixed-income investments whose
value was written down in May 2009. That income, known as
discount accretion, is excluded from operating profit.  Analysts had expected the company to earn 83 cents a share
on an operating basis, according to the average estimate of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  State Street fell 70 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $40.51 at
8:23 a.m. on electronic markets before the start of regular New
York trading. Before today, the stock fell 5.4 percent this
year, compared with the 1.6 percent increase by the  Standard &
Poor’s index  of custody banks and asset managers.  Custody Fees  Unrealized losses on bond investments whose value had
declined decreased in the quarter to $281 million from $2.99
billion a year ago. The positive change lowered the risk that
State Street will have to make additional writedowns.  Custody fees rose 19 percent to $989 million from a year
earlier, driven by acquisitions, new business and a rise in
equity markets in September. Assets under custody increased 12
percent to $14.9 trillion.  Fees earned for managing clients’ investments dropped 3
percent to $213 million because a higher proportion of assets
were in lower-fee vehicles, such as bonds. Investment assets
under management increased 9.7 percent to $1.9 trillion from a
year earlier.  Custody and investing asset levels benefitted from the best
September for U.S. stocks in 71 years. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index gained 8.8 percent last month, the most in the month since
1939.  Revenue from trading services, which includes foreign
exchange trading and brokerage fees, fell 15 percent to $228
million. Securities-finance revenue, hurt by low interest rates,
declined 35 percent to $68 million.  Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities to institutional investors including mutual funds,
pension funds and hedge funds.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  in New York
is the second-largest custody bank.  (State Street is scheduled to hold a conference call for
