Eni SpA , Italy’s biggest oil
company, produced light crude oil from a deepwater well offshore
Angola in a joint venture with state oil company, Sonangol SA.  The well flowed at a rate of more than 6,000 barrels a day,
Rome-based Eni said in an e-mailed statement. The production
rate was constrained by surface equipment, the company said.  The Mpungi-1 well is located in Block 15/06, 75 miles (120
kilometers) off the coast in 1,050 meters of water. The well hit
oil at 2,300 meters in the upper and middle Miocene sand
reservoirs, Eni said. The well is the seventh discovery in the
block of eight wells drilled and completes contract obligations
18 months ahead of schedule, the company said.  Eni has a 35 percent interest in the block, while  Total SA 
and Sonangol each hold 15 percent. SSI Fifteen Ltd. has 20
percent while Falcon Oil Holding Angola SA, Petrobas
International Braspetro BV and  Statoil ASA  each have 5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
