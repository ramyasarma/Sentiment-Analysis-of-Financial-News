German bunds declined as Spain’s
funding costs fell at a debt sale before the Mediterranean
nation passes its most austere spending plan in three decades,
sapping demand for Europe’s safest government securities.  Losses pushed the yield on the two-year note above 0.9
percent for the first time since April. The euro interbank
offered rate, or Euribor, for three-month loans stayed above 1
percent, signaling greater willingness by financial institutions
to lend to one another. Spanish bonds rose as the country sold
6.4 billion euros ($8.4 billion) of debt. The  ZEW Center for
European Economic Research  said  investors ’ gauge of current
economic conditions in Germany climbed to a three-year high.  “There is that sense of progression on the fiscal front
and normalization in the money markets, so that may just be
taking a bit of the shine off bonds,” said  Orlando Green ,
assistant director of capital-markets strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. The ZEW’s
current-conditions indicator is “slightly bullish” for
economic growth, he said.  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark security,
increased four basis points to 2.42 percent as of 12:09 p.m. in
London, and reached the highest since Sept. 21. The 2.25 percent
security due September 2020 fell 0.33, or 3.3 euros per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 98.50. The two-year yield was at 0.91
percent, the most since April 26.  Spanish Sale  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds dropped one basis point
to 4.02 percent, leaving the extra yield investors demand to
hold the securities instead of similar bunds down four basis
points to 158 basis points, near the least since Aug. 10.  Spain  sold 4.18 billion euros of 12-month bills at an
average yield of 1.842 percent today, compared with 1.908
percent at the last auction on Sept. 21. It sold 2.22 billion
euros of 18-month bills at a yield of 2.009 percent, compared
with 2.146 percent in September, the Bank of Spain said. It had
set a target of 6 billion to 7 billion euros for the sale.
Greece also sold bills today.  Spain’s budget will be debated in Parliament today and
tomorrow and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero secured
a majority for the vote on his fiscal plan through agreements
with two regional parties. The alliances also clear the way for
Zapatero, who got an austerity package through Parliament in May
with a one-vote margin, to overhaul the pension system and
employment policies as the country emerges from the deepest
 recession  in six decades.  To contact the reporters on this story:
