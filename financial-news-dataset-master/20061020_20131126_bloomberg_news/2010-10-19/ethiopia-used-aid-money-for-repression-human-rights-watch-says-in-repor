Ethiopia ’s ruling party used
international aid to suppress dissent before elections in May,
which it won with a landslide, Human Rights Watch said in a
report on its website today.  The New York-based group said Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi ’s
Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front used “donor-
supported programs” to “control the population, punish
dissent, and undermine political opponents.”  Local officials denied opposition supporters access to
seeds, fertilizer, agricultural land, credit, food aid and other
resources, the organization said in its third critical report on
the Horn of Africa Nation this year. The report was based on
interviews with more than 200 people in 53 villages between June
and December 2009.  The ruling alliance won 545 out of 547 seats in parliament
in May. The European Union election observer mission said in a
May 25 report that the vote did “not meet certain international
commitments.” The Ethiopian government has not yet commented on
the latest report by Human Rights Watch and no one was available
for comment at the Communications Ministry when Bloomberg called
seeking comment.  Human Rights Watch said Ethiopia is the second-largest
recipient of foreign aid in the world, receiving about $3
billion annually.  Louise Scura, acting Ethiopia country director for the
World Bank, said its officials had been “engaging directly”
with Human Rights Watch and that they “take these type of
things very seriously.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  William Davison  in Addis
