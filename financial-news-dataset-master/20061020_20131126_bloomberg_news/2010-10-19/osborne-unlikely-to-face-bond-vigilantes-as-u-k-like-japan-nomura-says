The U.K. is unlikely to face a
Greek-style “bond vigilante” attack on its debt because the
pound trades freely and British investors own 75 percent of the
gilt market, Nomura International Plc said.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  unveils details
of the government’s spending-reduction plans tomorrow. Nomura
said it’s “unconvinced” about Osborne’s concern that investors
disappointed by the nation’s budget discipline may drive down
gilt prices.  “Chancellor Osborne need not fear the bond vigilantes,”
Nomura strategists  Jim McCormick  and Irena Sekulska wrote in an
e-mailed note today. “There are important differences between
the U.K. and the European periphery, enough to argue against a
major U.K. debt crisis, whether or not the Chancellor opts for
severe fiscal cuts.”  U.K. banks will also need to buy more gilts to meet the
Basel rules on financial institutions’ capital, supporting the
debt market, Nomura wrote. Britain’s situation will be like that
of Japan, where the debt market failed to collapse after the
1990s even as the nation began a “mix of super-loose monetary
policy and highly expansive fiscal policy,” the strategists
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
