Corn fell for the fifth straight
session and soybeans declined after an interest-rate increase in
China spurred speculation that slower growth and a rising dollar
will reduce commodity demand.  The  dollar  jumped as much as 1.7 percent against a six-
currency basket after China, the world’s largest grain and
soybean consumer, raised rates to slow inflation. Corn has
surged 54 percent since June 1 and soybeans gained 28 percent as
the government reduced estimates for the U.S. crop and hedge
funds increased their holdings.  “It’s a shock, not so much that China raised rates, but
the timing,” because many economists expected the rate increase
next year, said  Dale Durchholz , the senior analyst for AgriVisor
LLC in Bloomington, Illinois. “Everyone will wonder, ‘Is there
more to come later if this one doesn’t slow the economy and
speculation enough?’”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 11.25 cents, or 2
percent, to close at $5.46 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the first five-day slide since the end of June.  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 3.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close at $11.915 a bushel in Chicago, erasing an
earlier gain of 0.9 percent.  Corn prices reached a two-year high of $5.88 a bushel on
Oct. 13 and soybeans touched $12.145 on Oct. 15, the highest
level in 16 months. This year’s rallies were sparked partly by
adverse weather that reduced production in Russia, Ukraine,
Canada, Europe and the U.S.  Speculator Holdings  Hedge-fund managers  and other large speculators increased
net-long corn positions, or bets prices will rise, for futures
and options contracts by 2.3 percent to 410,439 in the week
ended Oct. 12, data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show. That’s up five-fold from 80,743 net longs at
the start of June.  In soybeans, l arge speculators  were net-long 146,125
contracts as of Oct. 12, compared with a net-short position of
1,177 on June 1, CFTC data show.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities
dropped the most since June 29, with 10 of the commodities
declining more than 2 percent.  “Chinese interest rates and the value of the dollar don’t
have much correlation, but it caught people leaning the wrong
way,” said  Roy Huckabay , the executive vice president for the
Linn Group in Chicago. “Commodities bore the brunt of the
dollar’s rally today.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show, followed by soybeans at $31.8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
