Orascom Telecom Holding SAE  shares
fell to the lowest in almost three months on speculation the
selection of Wind Hellas Telecommunications SA bondholders as
the preferred bidders for Wind will hurt Orascom.  Shares of Orascom, the biggest mobile-phone company in the
Middle East by number of subscribers,  slid  2.6 percent to 4.92
Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. in Cairo, the  lowest level 
since July 22.  Wind Hellas’ senior bondholders were picked as preferred
bidders for the Greek mobile-phone operator, its parent, Weather
Finance III Sarl, said yesterday. Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris , who controls Orascom and bought Wind Hellas out of
bankruptcy a year ago, also has submitted a bid.  “It is a misinterpretation of the Wind Hellas news as at
first all thought that it would directly affect Orascom but in
fact it should have no affect on the stock,” said  Ashraf Akhnoukh , senior equity sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial
International Brokerage Co.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
