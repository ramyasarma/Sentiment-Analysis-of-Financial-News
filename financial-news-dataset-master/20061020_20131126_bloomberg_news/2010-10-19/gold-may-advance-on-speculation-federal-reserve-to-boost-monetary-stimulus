Gold fluctuated in London as a pause
in the dollar’s slump curbed demand for the metal bought by some
investors as a means of protecting wealth.  The dollar was little changed against the euro after U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the nation will
preserve confidence in a strong dollar. The greenback slid to an
eight-month low against the euro last week after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said additional monetary stimulus may
be warranted. Gold, which usually moves inversely to the U.S.
currency, reached a record $1,387.35 an ounce on Oct. 14.  A steadying dollar “is mildly negative for gold,”  Peter Fertig , owner of Quantitative Commodity Research Ltd. in
Hainburg, Germany, said today by phone. “There are a lot of
worries” still, and data showing a slowing recovery “could
make another point for quantitative easing,” he said.  Immediate-delivery bullion lost 10 cents to $1,368.35 an
ounce at 9:38 a.m. in London. Prices swung between a gain of 0.2
percent and a loss of 0.3 percent. Gold for December delivery
was 0.2 percent lower at $1,368.70 an ounce on the Comex in New
York. Futures reached a record $1,388.10 on Oct. 14.  Builders in the U.S. probably began work on fewer homes in
September, a sign the residential real estate market will be
slow to recover from the worst recession since the 1930s,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Gold, up 25 percent this year, is heading for a 10th annual
gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920. Bullion
has outperformed global equities, Treasuries and most industrial
metals, prompting record investment in gold-backed exchange-
traded products. The metal rallied as central banks and
governments maintained low borrowing costs and spent trillions
of dollars to stimulate economies.  Quantitative Easing  Countries can’t devalue their currencies to achieve
economic growth, and the U.S. envisions the dollar will remain
the global reserve currency, Geithner yesterday said in a panel
discussion in Palo Alto, California.  “The dollar may remain a bit strong for the time being
after U.S. treasury secretary’s comments on the greenback, which
will probably lead to a correction in gold,” said  Hwang Il Doo ,
a senior trader at  Korea Exchange Bank  Futures Co. in Seoul.
“Still, the dollar’s gain is seen limited on expectations for
another round of quantitative easing.”  Gold will average $1,400 next year, up from a previous
forecast of $1,295, UBS AG analysts including  Edel Tully  said in
a report dated yesterday. The metal will be supported by
concerns about currency weakness and the likelihood of
quantitative easing, the bank said.  Holdings Decline  Gold assets  in ETPs declined 1.59 metric tons to 2,101.07
tons yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10
providers. Holdings are up 17 percent this year and reached a
record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14. Silver assets rose 57.06 tons
to 14,264.41 tons yesterday, the highest amount in at least
eight months, data compiled by Bloomberg from four providers
show.  China’s silver exports, the world’s largest, may drop about
40 percent this year on increased domestic demand from industry
and investors, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Shipments may decline from about 3,500 tons in
2009,  Feng Juncong , chief analyst at the state-owned Antaike,
said in an interview, without specifying a number.  Silver for immediate delivery in London was unchanged at
$24.32 an ounce. The metal reached $24.92 on Oct. 14, the
highest level for 30 years.  UBS raised its 2011 silver forecast by 14 percent to
$22.25. The bank increased its platinum estimate for next year
by 6 percent to $1,800 an ounce and raised its palladium outlook
by 19 percent to $625 an ounce.  Platinum added 0.1 percent to $1,695.25 an ounce. Palladium
fell 0.2 percent to $586.28 an ounce after reaching $605.13 on
Oct. 14, the highest price since June 2001.  To contact the reporters on this story:
