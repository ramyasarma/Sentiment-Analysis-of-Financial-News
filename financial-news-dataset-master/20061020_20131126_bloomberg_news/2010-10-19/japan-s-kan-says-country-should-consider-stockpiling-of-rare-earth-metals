Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said Japan
should consider stockpiling rare earths, an indication that the
country is trying to reduce its reliance on China for metals
companies use in cars and electronics.  “Stockpiling is one option we need to consider,” Kan told
reporters in Tokyo today. While Japan is trying to secure
supplies from countries other than China, establishing those
agreements may take “some time,” he said.  China may cut export quotas for rare earth minerals by as
much as 30 percent next year to prevent overexploitation, the
China Daily reported, citing an unidentified official from the
Ministry of Commerce.  Japanese officials have said supplies of rare earth to
companies have been restricted following a dispute between the
two countries over a Chinese fishing boat collision with
Japanese Coast Guard vessels last month.  China imposed a “de facto” ban on rare-earth exports to
Japan, Economy Minister  Banri Kaieda  said on Sept. 28 and
Foreign Minister  Seiji Maehara  said this week that trading of
the metals with China remains“far from normal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
