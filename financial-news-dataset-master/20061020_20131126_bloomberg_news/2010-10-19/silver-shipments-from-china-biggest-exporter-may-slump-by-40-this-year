Silver  exports from China, the
world’s largest, may drop about 40 percent this year as domestic
demand from industry and investors climbs, according to Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  Shipments may decline from about 3,500 metric tons in 2009,
said  Feng Juncong , chief analyst at the state-owned Antaike,
without providing a specific forecast. Customs data show exports
plunged almost 60 percent to 970 tons in the first eight months.
Cancellation of an export rebate in 2008 is also hurting
shipments, she said.  Reduced exports may bolster prices that are trading near a
30-year high on speculation that governments worldwide will take
further steps to stimulate their economies, weakening currencies
and increasing demand for assets that are a store of value.
China, the third-largest producer after Peru and Mexico, revoked
export rebates in August 2008 to curb use of natural resources.  “There is huge demand in China this year and that has
affected exports, which were already hurt after the tax rebate
was abolished,” said  Ng Cheng Thye , head of bullion at Standard
Bank Asia. “The demand is coming from all areas, including
jewelry, investment and fabrication and this has resulted in a
physical market shortage in the Far East.”  The metal for immediate delivery touched $24.92 an ounce on
Oct. 14, the highest price since September 1980, and traded at
$24.2750 at 2:28 p.m. in Singapore. Industrial applications for
silver, including electrical conductors and batteries, represent
about half global demand.  Silver Rally  “China may sharply reduce its  silver  exports this year
following the scrapping of the rebate and as domestic demand
picked up amid expectations for higher inflation,” Feng said.
This year’s 5,100-ton quota is unlikely to be fully used, she
said.  Silver has rallied 44 percent this year, outperforming gold
and copper. In the short term, prices will be between $20.50 and
$25.50, GFMS Chairman  Philip Klapwijk  said on Oct. 16. “Silver
is likely nearing a top now, and that it has more downside in
the short term than upside,” he said. “But we remain bullish
in the long term.”  China’s  silver  production, including mined, by-product
output and recycled material, grew by an average 14.9 percent
every year in the 20 years since 1990 to 10,348 tons in 2009,
Feng said. Growth was mainly because of the fast-growing
production of lead, zinc and copper, which generates silver as a
by-product, Feng said.  Output Drops  The country’s silver output dropped 1.9 percent in the
first eight months to 7,445 tons, she said. About 60 percent of
China’s silver mined output is in the form of by-product of base
metals, according to Antaike estimates.  An expected drop in lead and zinc concentrate supplies will
affect domestic smelter production, weighing on China’s silver
output growth, she added.  “There are Chinese investors now hoarding silver, along
with other resources, amid anticipation of higher inflation,”
Feng said. “China is short of resources so these investors
believe the metals will be more valuable in the future.”  -- Feiwen Rong . With reporting by  Glenys Sim  in Singapore and
