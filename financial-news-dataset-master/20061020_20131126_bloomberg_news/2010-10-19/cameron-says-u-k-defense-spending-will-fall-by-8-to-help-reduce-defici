U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
said defense spending will be cut by 8 percent in inflation-
adjusted terms to help pay down Britain’s record budget deficit.  “Our national security depends on our economic strength
and visa versa,” Cameron told lawmakers in the House of Commons
today. The money saved will help to tackle the deficit, he said.
“This is not a cost-saving exercise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
