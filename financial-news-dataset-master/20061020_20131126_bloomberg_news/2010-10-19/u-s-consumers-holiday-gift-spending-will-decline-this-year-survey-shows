U.S. consumers will spend about 2
percent less on gifts this holiday season as shoppers remain
concerned about a weak economy, the  Consumer Electronics
Association  estimated, citing an annual survey.  The average consumer will spend $750 on holiday gifts, the
industry trade group said today in a statement. A third of the
survey’s respondents said they planned to reduce spending for
reasons related to unemployment, the association said.  “While the recession officially ended a year and half ago,
consumers remain very cautious,” Shawn DuBravac, CEA’s chief
economist and director of research, said in the statement.
“Worries remain over the economy and employment picture.”  Electronic gadgets ranked as the most-sought gift, with
shoppers expected to spend $232 each on average, a 5 percent
increase from last year and the highest amount since tracking
began in 1993, the Arlington, Virginia-based CEA said.  Notebook computers and Cupertino, California-based  Apple
Inc .’s iPad tablet top the list of gifts, followed by clothes
and electronic readers such as Seattle-based  Amazon.com Inc .’s
Kindle.  The telephone survey of 1,003 adults was conducted Sept.
24-27, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage
points, the association said.  Separately today, the  National Retail Federation  estimated
a 1 percent increase in per-consumer shopping, to $688.87. The
survey was conducted for the Washington-based trade group by
BIGresearch. Of the total, $518.08 will be spent on gifts, a 2.1
percent increase from 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
