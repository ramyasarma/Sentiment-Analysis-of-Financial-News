Bank regulators must coordinate
efforts to detect concentrations of risk and leverage before
they threaten global financial stability, a Reserve Bank of
Australia official said.  “Alongside the goal of improving banks’ resilience through
stronger capital and liquidity positions, there is the goal of
improving the resilience of the system,”  Luci Ellis , head of
financial stability at the central bank, said in prepared
remarks in Sydney today. “This means being alert to the
possible connections between different parts of the financial
system” and “detecting the buildup of risk-taking and leverage
as it happens.”  Ellis, in the text of her speech, didn’t address monetary
policy or Australia’s economy. Her comments come a day after the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said banks will have
until 2015 to fully implement rules on how much cash and liquid
securities they must hold to gird against a funding shortage in
a crisis.  The rules are part an overhaul of bank capital requirements
the committee is working on to prevent another financial crisis.
Ellis said timely information is the key to better oversight.  “Regardless of whether the supervisor is inside or outside
the central bank, it is important it shares information readily
with the team in the central bank that is responsible for
monitoring the stability of the financial system as a whole,”
Ellis told the  Finsia Annual Conference .  The RBA said last month in its half-yearly financial
stability review that Australia’s financial system remains in
strong condition as the nation’s four largest banks reported a
15 percent surge in earnings after “fully recouping” higher
funding costs caused by the global crisis.  To contact the reporter for this story:
