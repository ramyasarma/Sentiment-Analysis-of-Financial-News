Investors should buy Chinese stocks
on any “dips” following an unexpected interest-rate increase
in the nation, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said, citing the
market’s earnings growth and valuations.  The move by the People’s Bank of China may also “remove a
risk overhang,” according to a report by analysts including
Helen Zhu and Timothy Moe. Declines following previous rate
increases were “short-lived, if any,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
