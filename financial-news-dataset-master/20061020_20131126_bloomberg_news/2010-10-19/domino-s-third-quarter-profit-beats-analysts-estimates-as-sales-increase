Domino’s Pizza Inc. , the world’s
largest pizza delivery chain, posted a 6.9 percent decline in
third-quarter earnings, exceeding analysts’ estimates as an
improved recipe boosted sales.  Net income fell to $16.6 million, or 27 cents, from $17.8
million, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the Ann Arbor, Michigan-
based company said today in a statement. Profit excluding costs
and gains related to debt payments was also 27 cents, beating
the  25-cent average  of 9 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Domino’s has overhauled its offering in the U.S. in the
past year and started an advertising campaign to change customer
perceptions. The company introduced a new pizza recipe with
sweeter sauce and garlic-seasoned crust on Dec. 16, which helped
boost sales even as customers curbed budgets in the slowing
economy.  “Our results are about our new pizza,” J.  Patrick Doyle ,
Domino’s chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview.
“We’re not seeing anything materially better in the consumer
environment.”  Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 12 percent
in the quarter, which ended Sept. 12. The increase on that basis
for international outlets was 7 percent, the 67th consecutive
quarter of growth. Total  revenue  climbed 15 percent to $347.4
million.  The chain plans to boost sales by enticing more consumers
to buy the new pizza, rather than trying to get existing ones to
spend more, Doyle said.  Domino’s rose 92 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $15.55 at
4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, for its
biggest daily percentage gain since July 22. The  shares  have
advanced 86 percent this year.  Domino’s reported an international store increase of 76, to
4,264, in the quarter and a U.S. reduction of 4, to 4,905.  The company said it repurchased $20 million of its debt
during the three-month period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
