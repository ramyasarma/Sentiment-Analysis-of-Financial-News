Trading of put options on U.S.
 technology stocks  surged to 7.4 times the four-week average,
with almost half of the volume coming from a single wager the
shares will pare their 19 percent rally since August in the next
two months.  Almost 180,000 puts to sell the Technology Select Sector
SPDR exchange-traded fund changed hands as of 4 p.m. in New
York, 82 times the number of calls to buy. The ETF that tracks
companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. lost 1.8
percent to $23.82. The  biggest trade  was in a “butterfly”
strategy involving 80,000 December contracts that pay off the
most if the fund falls to $22 before expiration on Dec. 17.  “It’s definitely a sign of pessimism in the technology
sector,” said Caitlin Duffy, an equity options analyst at
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group Inc., in
an interview. “The butterfly spread is a large volume position
and it may or may not be a hedge.”  Investors bought protection today after the profit estimate
from Apple, the world’s largest technology company by market
value, missed estimates and International Business Machines
Corp., the biggest computer-services provider, posted a drop in
new contracts. Technology companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose 19 percent through yesterday after falling to an
eight-week low on Aug. 31, propelled by gains of 30 percent from
8 of 76 companies.  Today’s butterfly spread trade involved an investor selling
40,000 of the ETF’s December $22 puts while buying 20,000 each
of the December $21 and $23 puts, according to Duffy. The
strategy breaks even around $22.93, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg, and pays the most if the stock falls to $22 by
expiration.  To contact the reporters on this story:
