A Chicago attorney pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and tax evasion charges for his role in a billion-
dollar phony tax-shelter scheme that brought down his law firm
in 2007.  Erwin Mayer , 47, a former attorney at the defunct law firm
 Jenkens & Gilchrist , faces as long as 10 years in prison at his
sentencing, scheduled for Feb. 10 before U.S. District Judge
 William H. Pauley  in Manhattan.  “I am filled with shame and remorse for what I did,”
Mayer said today in court.  Mayer was one of seven people indicted in June 2009 on
charges of conspiracy and tax evasion for their roles in
marketing the phony shelters from 1994 to 2005. Prosecutors said
the defendants used the shelters to generate more than
$7.32 billion in fraudulent tax losses for at least 931 wealthy
individuals.  Jenkins & Gilchrist in 2005 agreed to pay $81.6 million to
clients who sued over its tax-shelter advice. In March 2007, the
firm avoided prosecution by admitting it developed and marketed
tax shelters that generated more than $1 billion in phony
losses, and then shut down.  Two other Jenkens & Gilchrist attorneys,  Paul M. Daugerdas 
and  Donna Guerin , also have been indicted. Daugerdas previously
served as a tax partner at Arthur Andersen LLP and headed the
tax department at the Chicago law firm Altheimer & Gray, where
Guerin and Mayer both worked as certified public accountants.  The case is U.S. v. Daugerdas, 1:09-cr-00581, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
