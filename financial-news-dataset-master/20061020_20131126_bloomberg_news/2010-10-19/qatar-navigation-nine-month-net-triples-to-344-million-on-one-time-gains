Qatar Navigation Co ., a freight
transportation company based in the Persian Gulf emirate, said
nine-month profit more than tripled after including one-off
gains related to an acquisition.  Net income rose to 1.25 billion riyals ($340 million) in
the nine months ended Sept. 30 from 347.6 million riyals a year
earlier, the company said in a  posting on the Qatar Exchange
today . Earnings per share increased to 10.94 riyals from 4.83
riyals.  Qatar Navigation, which acquired Qatar Shipping Co. earlier
this year, earned 236 million riyals in “fair value gain” from
its 15 percent share in the company prior to the takeover,  the
company said . It also recorded a gain of 397 million riyals,
which represented the difference between the acquisition price
and the net fair value of Qatar Shipping’s assets.  “In spite of the slowdown in the global economy and its
effect on freight volume and prices, the company was able to
achieve strong results due to its diversified activities and
strategic investments,” Qatar Navigation Chairman Ali bin
Jassim bin Mohammed Al-Thani said in the statement today.  Qatar Navigation bought Qatar Shipping in an all-share
transaction in January, acquiring 2.2 shares in Qatar Shipping
for every Qatar Navigation share. The purchase came after a
world-wide economic slowdown reduced demand for shipping goods
by sea.  Qatar Navigation  rose 3.9 percent to 82.8 riyals a share on
the Qatar Exchange today, the biggest gain since June 1. The
stock has risen 28 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
