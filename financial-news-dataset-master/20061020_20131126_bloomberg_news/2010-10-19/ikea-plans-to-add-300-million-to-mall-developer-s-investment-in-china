Ikea  will add $300 million to the
$1.2 billion the mall developer it part owns plans to spend in
China as the world’s largest home-furnishings retailer taps
rising consumption in the world’s  most populous nation .  Inter Ikea Centre Group , which builds shopping centers,
today said it will open its third China mall in Wuhan, Hubei
province. China Managing Director Ding Hui said  Ikea  will add
$300 million to the funds budgeted for building malls in the
Asian nation.  Retail sales in China rose 18 percent in the first eight
months of 2010 from a year earlier as the fastest growth among
major economies spurred spending. Ikea is expanding in China as
the nation seeks to boost domestic consumption after households
accumulated $16.5 trillion of assets.  The Swedish furnishings retailer said it aims to more than
double the number of stores in  China  to 18 by 2015, from 8 now.
“They are combinations of standalones and shopping centers,”
Gillian Drakeford, Ikea China retail manager, said in an
interview today. The company’s eight stores in China will draw
27.3 million visitors this year, Drakeford forecast.  Inter Ikea plans to invest as much as $1.2 billion in China
over the next five years, managing director John Tegner said in
November. The company’s Beijing mall, with 200,000 square meters
(2.2 million square feet) of retail space, is scheduled to open
in 2014, Ding said at the time.  The company started building its first shopping center in
China in the eastern city of Wuxi in July 2008.  Inter Ikea Centre is 49 percent-owned by Ikea Group with
the rest held by Inter Ikea Group.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
