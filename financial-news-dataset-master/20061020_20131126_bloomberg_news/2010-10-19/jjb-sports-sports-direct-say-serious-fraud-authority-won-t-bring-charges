JJB Sports Plc,  the U.K.’s third-
largest sporting goods retailer, said the Serious Fraud Office
completed its investigation into the company and  Sports Direct
International Plc  and decided no charges are to be brought
against the companies or any firms linked to them.  The Serious Fraud Office’s investigation into individuals
continues, JJB Sports said in a statement on the Regulatory News
Service today. JJB Sports said it will continue to cooperate
fully with the investigation carried out by the Serious Fraud
Office, which prosecutes white-collar crime.  Sports Direct International Plc said earlier today the
U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office will shortly confirm that its
investigation into the two retailers has been completed and no
charges will be brought against the companies.  In September last year, JJB Sports and Sports Direct
International were raided by the U.K.’s fraud and competition
authorities as part of a probe into possible price fixing.  Sports Direct shares fell 2.2 percent to 145.9 pence in
London today while JJB Sports shares climbed 7.3 percent to 11
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
