U.K. regulator Ofcom said it won’t
investigate the Internet-television platform of  BT Group Plc ,
 ITV Plc  and the British Broadcasting Corp. after competitors
said the venture could harm competition.  Internet television is an “emerging sector” and it would
be premature to open an investigation, Ofcom said today in a
statement.  Virgin Media Inc.  and  British Sky Broadcasting Group
Plc  had complained that the venture’s partners might withhold
content from competing platforms.  The Project Canvas venture, formed with  TalkTalk Telecom
Group Plc , will build an open, Internet-connected television-on-
demand platform with common technical standards. TalkTalk said
in July that the venture, to be known as YouView, will start by
mid-2011. The platform was originally planned to start at the
end of this year.  An investigation would be “premature at the current stage
of YouView’s development given the absence of a clear risk of
consumer harm,” Ofcom Chief Executive Officer  Ed Richards  said
in the statement. “If evidence does emerge in the future that
YouView causes harm to the interests of viewers and consumers we
may reconsider whether to investigate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
