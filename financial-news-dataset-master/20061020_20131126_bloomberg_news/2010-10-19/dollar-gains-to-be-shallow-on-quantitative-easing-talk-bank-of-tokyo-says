Gains by the dollar will be limited
while speculation about a second round of quantitative easing
from the Federal Reserve persists, according to Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  “The specter of QE2 continues to hang over the dollar and
without a notable change in expectations in regard to QE2, any
recovery for the dollar is likely to be relatively shallow,”
 Derek Halpenny , London-based European head of global currency
research at the bank, wrote in a research note today.  The dollar has advanced the past three days against the 16-
nation common currency and was 0.1 percent stronger at $1.3977
per euro as of 9:37 a.m. in London. The U.S. currency has
declined 6.2 percent versus the euro in the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
