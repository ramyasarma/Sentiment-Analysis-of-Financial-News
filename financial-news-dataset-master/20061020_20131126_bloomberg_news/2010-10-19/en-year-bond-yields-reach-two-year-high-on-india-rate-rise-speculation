India’s  10-year bonds  dropped for a
fourth day on concern the central bank will increase  interest
rates  at its policy review next month to cool inflation.  Yields climbed to the highest level in two years after the
benchmark  wholesale price index  rose 8.6 percent in September
from a year earlier. It gained 8.5 percent in August. The
 central bank  has raised interest rates five times this year, the
most increases in Asia.  “The market is nervous about another rate increase,” said
 Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank in
Mumbai. “Nobody seems to have the courage to hold on to large
positions given the negative sentiment among investors.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose two
basis points to 8.11 percent as of 9:52 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The yield
earlier touched 8.13 percent, the highest level since October
2008. The price fell 0.13, or 13 paise per 100 rupee face amount,
to 97.95.  The central bank may raise the  reverse repurchase rate , at
which it absorbs cash from lenders, by 50 basis points to 5.5
percent and the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 6.25
percent at its policy review on Nov. 2, Verma said.  Inflation still remains “well above” the central bank’s
“comfort zone,” Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said Oct. 5 in
Mumbai, prompting speculation of more monetary tightening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
