Land Securities Group Plc, the
U.K.’s largest real estate investment trust, and Canary Wharf
Group Plc formed a joint venture to build the London tower known
as the Walkie-Talkie, two people briefed on the plan said.  The two companies will be joint developers of the office
building, according to the people, who asked not to named
because the decision hasn’t been made public. Canary Wharf, the
developer of the financial district in London’s Docklands where
the tower is planned, will be responsible for its construction.
The venture will be announced today, the people said.  Land Securities said in May it was looking for a partner
for the 680,000 square-foot (63,000 square-meter) property. It
postponed construction in 2008 on concern that there wouldn’t be
demand from tenants in a slowing global economy. The London-
based company planned to start building the 36-story tower,
known as the Walkie-Talkie because of its shape, in 2011.  Canary Wharf is a unit of London-based  Songbird Estates
Plc , which said in the prospectus for its 140 million-pound
($222 million) share sale that it completed last week that it
may sell as much as 35 percent of the Walkie-Talkie project to
its main investors, which include Qatar Holding LLC,  China
Investment Corp.  and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds.  Calls to spokesmen for Canary Wharf and Land Securities
weren’t returned late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
