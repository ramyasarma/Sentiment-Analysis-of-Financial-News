Hungarian stocks rose for the first
time in four days, driven by  Mol Nyrt. , the nation’s largest
refiner, which gained the most in two weeks after its chief
executive said the company may pay less tax than anticipated.  The benchmark BUX Index climbed 1.4 percent to 23,725.23 as
of 9:55 a.m. in Budapest, its biggest increase since Sept. 30.
 Mol  advanced as much as 675 forint, or 3.3 percent, to 20,950
forint, rising the most since Sept. 30. It has gained 23 percent
this year, compared with a 12 percent gain in the 13-member  BUX .  Mol expects to pay as much as 20 billion forint ($101
million) in a special tax levied by the government on energy
companies, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Zsolt Hernadi 
said in an interview with Inforadio late yesterday. The levy
will yield 70 billion forint in budget revenue annually, Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said last week.  “The potential tax payment of up to 20 billion forint
annually is below our pre-estimates of 35 billion forint,”  Olena Kyrylenko , analyst at KBC Securities in Budapest, said in a note
today. The tax may shave 1.2 percent off Mol’s share value,
compared with KBC’s earlier estimate of a 3.5 percent, she said.  A last-minute change to the law on the special tax,
approved by lawmakers last night, will allowed companies to
deduct the levy from their corporate tax base, according to the
text of the law posted on Parliament’s website. Energy companies
will have to pay 1.05 percent of their 2010 sales, according to
the bill.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
