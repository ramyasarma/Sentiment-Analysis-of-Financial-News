Bajaj Auto Ltd. , India’s second-
largest motorcycle maker, said net income in the second quarter
rose 69 percent to a record as economic growth boosted sales.  Profit  in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 6.82
billion rupees ($154 million), or 23.6 rupees a share, from 4.03
billion rupees, or 13.9 rupees, a year earlier, Bajaj said in a
statement today.  Sales  at the Pune, India-based company
increased 50 percent to 41.8 billion rupees.  Bajaj Auto’s domestic sales of motorcycles including the
Pulsar and Discover rose 53 percent in the quarter as economic
expansion and stock market gains spurred spending in the world’s
second-largest two wheeler market. The company expects to boost
overall sales of two- and three-wheel vehicles 40 percent to 4
million in the year ending March 31.  Bajaj  rose  as much as 2.7 percent to 1,560 rupees in Mumbai
trading, and changed hands at 1,548.5 rupees at 1:50 p.m. The
stock has gained 77 percent this year.  India’s economy expanded 8.8 percent in the quarter ended
in June, the fastest pace in 2 1/2 years. The nation’s benchmark
Sensitive Index gained 16 percent this year, the best performer
among the world’s 10 biggest stock markets.  Bajaj’s total sales, including exports, surpassed 1 million
vehicles in the fiscal second quarter, according to the
statement.  Bajaj’s margin on earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization was 20.7 percent in the quarter,
according to the statement. It expects the margin to be 20
percent for the fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
