International Finance Corp., the
World Bank’s private investment arm, plans to double lending
commitments to five East African nations in the year through
June 2011, much of it in energy and agricultural projects.  Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi will receive
investment pledges of about $300 million in the period, compared
with $150 million a year earlier, Aida Kimemia, IFC principal
investment officer in Kenya, said in an interview in the
capital, Nairobi, today.  “There are signs which are very positive for the region’s
economy,” Kimemia said.  Faster growth in East Africa has put energy supplies under
strain, while rising global food demand is attracting increased
investment in agriculture. Kenya, East Africa’s largest economy,
will expand about 4.1 percent this year, from 2.4 percent a year
earlier, while growth in Tanzania, the region’s second-biggest
economy, accelerates to 6.5 percent from 6 percent, the
 International Monetary Fund  said on Oct. 6.  The Washington-based lender made commitments to invest a
record $2.4 billion in sub-Saharan Africa in the 2009-10 fiscal
year as governments implemented more business-friendly policies,
 Jean Philippe Prosper , IFC director for eastern and southern
Africa, said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
