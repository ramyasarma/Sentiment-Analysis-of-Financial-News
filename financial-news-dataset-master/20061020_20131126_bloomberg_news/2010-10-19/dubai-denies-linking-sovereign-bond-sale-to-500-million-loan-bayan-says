Dubai’s finance department denied
asking lenders for a $500 million loan as part of an arrangement
to sell a sovereign bond, al-Bayan newspaper reported today
without saying where it obtained the information.  The Financial Times reported yesterday that the emirate
asked lenders seeking to manage its recent sovereign bond sale
to offer the government a $500 million loan over three years at
300 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. The
newspaper cited two senior bankers with knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
