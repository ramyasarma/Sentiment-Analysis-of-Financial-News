The  Tel Aviv Stock Exchange  will
expand indexes for technology companies to help lure investment
as outflows grow, Chief Executive Officer  Ester Levanon  said.  The Israeli bourse will create a 50-stock  technology  index
that also tracks biotechnology companies and another focused on
the industry, Levanon said in an interview. The TASE, as the
exchange is known, currently has a 15-share technology index
that includes Given Imaging Ltd. of Yoqneam and Ra’anana-based
Nice Systems Ltd. and has dropped 2.5 percent this year.  Israel, upgraded by MSCI Inc. on May 27 to developed market
status from emerging,  recorded  a net $1.08 billion of sales of
Tel Aviv-traded shares by foreign investors in the second
quarter after $571 million of outflows in the first three
months, central bank data show. The benchmark TA-25 Index has
gained 13 percent since the MSCI change, outperforming the 11
percent advance for the  MSCI Developed Markets  measure while
trailing the 21 percent jump in the  developing nation index .  “We’re trying to find the right niche and we believe that
technology is it,” Levanon said in the interview at Bloomberg’s
headquarters in New York yesterday, without specifying a time
frame for the index changes. “We’re aiming to make it bigger to
attract foreigners.”  Levanon, 64, also said the exchange put off plans to become
a limited liability company because of the global financial
crisis. The bourse currently is owned by its members, both banks
and non-financial companies.  The  TA-25 Index  fell 0.7 percent yesterday to 1,251.02 from
a record 1,259.17 on Oct. 18. The  Tel-Tech  gauge of 15
technology companies dropped 0.9 percent.  MSCI’s decision to move the country to a developed-nation
index prompted Harvard University, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and
Eaton Vance Corp. to sell a combined $210 million in Israeli
stocks from their emerging-market investments in the second
quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based on
company disclosures as of Sept. 2.  “The upgrade is very good for Israel, you can’t judge it
on two-month periods,” Levanon said. “It can only help Israel
as it’s now accessible to more investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
