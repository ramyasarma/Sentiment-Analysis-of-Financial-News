The federal judge who overturned a
moratorium on deep-water drilling threw out regulations issued
after the BP Plc oil spill, saying the government failed to give
proper notice for its rulemaking.  U.S. District Judge  Martin Feldman  in New Orleans said
today that the government was obliged to offer notice and accept
comments on 10 new safety measures imposed on deep-water oil and
gas operators in May. Feldman didn’t address Interior Department
rules, known collectively as NTL-05, when he struck down the
moratorium in June.  “NTL-05 imposes additional duties on operators and
lessees,” Feldman said. “Notice and comment were required by
law. The government did not comply and the NTL-05 is of no
lawful force or effect.”  The Obama Administration first banned deep-water drilling
in May and issued new rules in July after Feldman threw out the
original moratorium as too broad. Regulators lifted the second
ban last week, while retaining the safety rules imposed in May.  Feldman issued today’s ruling in a lawsuit challenging the
second moratorium from July. The U.S. on Oct. 12 asked Feldman
to dismiss this lawsuit, calling it irrelevant given the new
policy. Feldman said he’d rule on the question after a Nov. 3
hearing.  The government is studying Feldman’s ruling and has no
immediate comment on it Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department
spokesman, said in a telephone interview today.  The case is Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-01941,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans).
