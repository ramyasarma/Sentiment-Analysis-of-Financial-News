ZAO Alrosa , the world’s largest
diamond miner, may seek to raise between $2 billion and $2.5
billion through an initial public offering,  Kommersant reported ,
citing Chief Executive Officer  Fyodor Andreyev .  Alrosa may sell a 20 percent stake in Moscow and possibly
also London and use the proceeds to develop new mines, including
the GMK Timir iron ore project in East Siberia, the Moscow-based
newspaper said, citing Andreyev.  The company plans to maintain gem production at between 32
million carats and 34 million carats for the next 10 years,
Kommersant said. A carat is a fifth of a gram.  Alrosa may also decide at a board meeting in December to
sell non-mining assets including hydropower plants and oil
fields in Angola and Russia, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
