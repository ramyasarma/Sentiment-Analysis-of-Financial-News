China unexpectedly raised its
benchmark lending and deposit rates for the first time since
2007 ahead of data that may show inflation accelerated to the
fastest pace in almost two years. Stocks and commodities fell.  The one-year lending rate will increase to 5.56 percent
from 5.31 percent, effective today, the People’s Bank of China
said on its website. The  deposit rate  will increase to 2.5
percent from 2.25 percent.  Crude oil, stocks in Europe and U.S. index futures dropped
on concern the engine of the global recovery will slow as
China’s policy makers seek to curb lending and prevent a
property bubble. Higher interest rates may encourage inflows of
speculative capital from abroad, complicating management of the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.  “The interest rate hike is beyond my expectation,” said
 Wang Tao , UBS AG’s Beijing-based economist. “It shows the
government is increasingly worried about inflation. This is the
beginning of a series of interest-rate hikes next year.”  Rare Earth Embargo  China, which has been blocking shipments of crucial
minerals to Japan for the last month, has now quietly halted
shipments of some of those same materials to the United States
and Europe, the New York Times reported, citing three industry
officials.  “The embargo is expanding” beyond Japan, one of the three
rare earth industry officials said, all of whom insisted on
anonymity for fear of business retaliation by Chinese
authorities, the newspaper reported.  They said Chinese customs officials imposed the broader
shipment restrictions Monday morning, hours after a top Chinese
official had summoned international news media Sunday night to
denounce U.S. trade actions, the Time said.  Li Drops U.K. Train Bid  Hong Kong billionaire  Li Ka-Shing ’s  Cheung Kong
Infrastructure Holdings Ltd.  dropped out as a potential bidder
for Britain’s high-speed rail link to the Channel Tunnel, said
two people with knowledge of the matter.  Cheung Kong Infrastructure, which has studied the asset and
expressed initial interest, decided it probably won’t make a
formal bid, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the discussions are private. Final offers are due by the
end of the month, one of the people said.  Hutchison Drops Ericsson in U.K.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.’s  3 U.K. mobile-phone unit will let
a $2.2 billion seven-year managed-services contract with
 Ericsson AB  expire when it ends in 2012.  The 3 unit, which completed a 400 million-pound network
upgrade last week, “gave notice of its intention to terminate”
the contract with Stockholm-based Ericsson, according to a
judgment on the deal’s exit provisions from the High Court of
Justice. The ruling is dated Oct. 18 and posted on the  court’s
website .  Gazprom Redirects to China  OAO Gazprom  is redirecting liquefied natural gas contracted
for the U.S. from its Sakhalin-2 project on the Pacific coast to
Asia after rising production from shale rocks and an economic
slowdown discouraged fuel imports.  The Russian gas exporter’s LNG unit sold volumes contracted
for the U.S. to China and India,  Elena Burmistrova , Gazprom
Export’s managing director for oil, petroleum and petrochemicals,
said in an interview with the Gazprom Export corporate
newsletter e-mailed.  Japan May Stockpile Rare Earths  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said Japan should consider
stockpiling rare earths, an indication that the country is
trying to reduce its reliance on China for metals companies use
in cars and electronics.  “Stockpiling is one option we need to consider,” Kan told
reporters in Tokyo. While Japan is trying to secure supplies
from countries other than China, establishing those agreements
may take “some time,” he said.  THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY:  Rail-related stocks: China has started development of a
