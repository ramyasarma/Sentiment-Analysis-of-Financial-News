Bank of Nova Scotia , Canada’s third-
largest bank, plans to buy a 15 percent stake in  Vietnam Joint-
Stock Commercial Bank for Industry & Trade , said  Pham Huy Hung ,
chairman of the Southeast Asian lender.  Scotiabank may purchase the stake in Vietnam’s second-
largest listed lender as early as December, or in early 2011 at
the latest, Hung said in Hanoi today. VietinBank, as the company
is known, last week sold a 10 percent stake to International
Finance Corp., the lending unit of the World Bank.  The Canadian bank had initially sought a 20 percent stake,
Hung said, adding that the size was limited by the Vietnamese
government. Based on today’s price, 15 percent of VietinBank’s
1.5 billion  outstanding shares  would be worth 4.3 trillion dong
($221 million), according to Bloomberg calculations.  Total assets of the Hanoi-based bank may increase 40
percent from a year earlier to 340 trillion dong by the end of
2010, Hung said. Assets totaled 320 trillion dong at the end of
the third quarter, deposits were 300 billion dong, and
outstanding loans reached 280 billion dong, the lender said in a
statement released today.  “We are targeting a growth rate of at least 30 percent a
year for total assets in the period of 2011 to 2015,” Hung said.
They will reach at least $40 billion in 2015, he said.  Hung also said VietinBank will invest $400 million in an
office and commercial building in Hanoi. The 300,000 square
meter project comprises two towers, one with 68 floors and the
other with 48, according to the statement.  The project will be completed in 2014, according to the
chairman. The towers will house the bank’s headquarters as well
as a five-star hotel, spa and serviced apartments.  Shares of VietinBank fell 0.5 percent to 18,900 dong at the
11 a.m. close of trading on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange.
The company has fallen 23 percent this year, outpacing the 8.2
percent decline in the benchmark  VN Index .  -- Nguyen Kieu Giang  in Hanoi. Editors:  Chitra Somayaji ,  Russell Ward   To contact Bloomberg staff on this story:
