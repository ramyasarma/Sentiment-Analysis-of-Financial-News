The premium of European Union carbon
permits for 2010 to offsets from the United Nations, which is
expecting a surge in requests for credits through 2012, advanced
to its widest level in more than nine weeks.  The spread between EU permits and UN credits for 2010,
traded as a separate contract, increased 11 cents, or 5.5
percent, to 2.10 euros ($2.92) a metric ton as of 8:50 a.m. on
London’s European Climate Exchange. That’s the biggest gap since
Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
