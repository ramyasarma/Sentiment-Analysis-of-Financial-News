BP Plc  plans to shut its Lingen oil
refinery in Germany in the third quarter of next year for
maintenance, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The company  is scheduled to halt the entire plant for
inspections and repairs for about six weeks at the end of 
August, the people said, declining to be identified because
the information is confidential. The company also plans to
halt its Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany in the fourth
quarter of 2011, one of the people said.  Robert Wine , a BP spokesman based at the company’s London
headquarters, declined to comment when called by Bloomberg
yesterday, citing company policy not to discuss planned
maintenance halts.  The Lingen refinery in northern Germany has an oil-
processing capacity of 93,000 barrels a day, and Gelsenkirchen
in the northwest can handle 266,000 barrels a day, according to
 BP’s  website.  Refiners carry out maintenance work at regular intervals to
ensure safe and efficient operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
