Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Chief
Executive Office  Bryan Marsal  charged the bankrupt firm $94,350
in July for 111 hours of work, according to a court  filing .  Marsal billed Lehman at $850 an hour, or a total of
$244,375 for June, July and August, according to a quarterly
compensation report filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan.  The U.S. Census Bureau reported that the country’s  median
household income  for all of last year was about $49,945.  Lehman, which is the most expensive bankruptcy in U.S.
history, has paid its managers and lawyers about $1 billion in
the two years since it filed for bankruptcy in September 2008.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, which Marsal co-
founded, was paid $356.4 million in fees for “interim
management” over 24 1/2 months, according to a court filing.  Marsal, 59, said last month that he aimed to raise
$57.5 billion for creditors within five years, cutting allowable
claims against those funds to about $365 billion.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
