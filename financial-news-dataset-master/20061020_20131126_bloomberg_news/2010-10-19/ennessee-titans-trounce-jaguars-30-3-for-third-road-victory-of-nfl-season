The Tennessee Titans lost
quarterback  Vince Young  to injury before beating the
Jacksonville Jaguars 30-3 for their third straight road victory
of the National Football League season.  The Titans (4-2) led 17-0 at halftime at EverBank Field in
Jacksonville, Florida, and extended their advantage to 20 points
before the Jaguars got their only score, a 33-yard field goal by
 Josh Scobee .  Kenny Britt ,  Bo Scaife  and  Chris Johnson  scored touchdowns
for the visitors, while  Rob Bironas  added three field goals.
Johnson, who had 26 carries for 111 yards, scored on a 35-yard
run with 1:40 left in the game.  Each team’s starting quarterback was knocked out of the
game in the first half. Tennessee’s Young sprained his left knee
in the first quarter after throwing a touchdown pass to Britt on
the opening drive, and was replaced by  Kerry Collins .  Trent Edwards  took over for Jacksonville (3-3) after  David Garrard 
suffered a concussion in the second quarter.  It was Edwards’s first appearance for the Jaguars after
being claimed off waivers three weeks ago from Buffalo.  In Week 7, Jacksonville plays at the Kansas City Chiefs on
Oct. 24, while Tennessee hosts the Philadelphia Eagles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
