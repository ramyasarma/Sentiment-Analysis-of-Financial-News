Cavotec MSL Holdings Ltd , a maker of
mobile power supplies that trades on New Zealand’s stock
exchange, may seek a second listing on a Nordic exchange because
trading volumes in the local market are too low.  The Christchurch-based company appointed Swedish bank
Svenska Handelsbanken AB to “explore the possibilities” for a
listing on the Nasdaq OMX First North exchange, according to a
statement. The exchange offers an alternative market for small
or growth companies.  Cavotec, which operates around the world, is seeking to
broaden its investor base and wants other avenues to raise
capital, according to the statement.  “Lower liquidity on the NZX, coupled with falls in overall
trading volumes over the past year, has underlined the necessity
of seeking alternative routes to capitalize on future
opportunities,” Chief Executive Officer  Ottonel Popesco  said
in the statement.  The First North bourse is operated by exchanges in
Copenhagen, Helsinki, Iceland and Stockholm.  To contact the reporter for this story:
