Vodacom Group Ltd. , the largest
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans, said
earnings for the six months ended Sept. 30 increased after
impairment and tax charges weren’t repeated.  Headline earnings per share, which excludes one-time items,
and earnings per share are both expected to be between 285 cents
and 307 cents, the company said in a statement today. The
earnings-per-share figure a year earlier was 4 cents, the
Johannesburg-based company said.  Vodacom took an impairment charge of 3.2 billion rand
($460 million) on subsidiary Gateway Communications in the same
period last year after traffic volumes fell in Africa in the
wake of the credit crisis. Gateway, acquired in 2008, provides
terrestrial and satellite services to consumers and businesses
on the continent.  Earnings in the prior period were also affected by the
reversal of a deferred tax asset in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo of 551 million rand, after operations in that mineral-
rich country declined because of weakening commodity markets and
price competition from other operators.  Vodacom rose 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 67.90 rand at the
close of trading at 5 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Vodacom will report first-half earnings on or about Nov. 8,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
