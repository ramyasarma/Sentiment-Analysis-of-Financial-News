Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ’s four-part, $5
billion bond offering jumped in the first day of trading,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The world’s largest retailer’s $1.25 billion of 5 percent
securities due in October 2040 were the most-traded corporate
bonds and rose more than those Wal-mart sold with shorter
maturity dates. They climbed 1.7 cents to 100.46 cents on the
dollar, Trace data show.  The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company’s $1.75 billion of
3.25 percent bonds due in October 2020 increased 0.4 cent to
100.02 cents on the dollar and its $1.25 billion of 1.5 percent
notes due in October 2015 rose 0.32 cent to 99.78 cents. Wal-
Mart’s $750 million of 0.75 percent debt due in October 2013
rose 0.49 cent to 100.15 cents on the dollar, Trace data show.  The company’s three- and five-year notes were issued with
the lowest coupons on record, according to Bank of America
Corp., which helped manage the sale yesterday with Barclays Plc
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
