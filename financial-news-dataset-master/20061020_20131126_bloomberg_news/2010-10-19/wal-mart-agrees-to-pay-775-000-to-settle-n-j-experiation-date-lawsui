Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
largest retailer, agreed to pay $775,000 to settle a lawsuit by
New Jersey claiming it sold infant formula and non-prescription
drugs after their expiration dates.  Wal-Mart will pay $500,000 in civil penalties, $160,000 for
New Jersey’s legal expenses, $40,000 for the state’s
investigative costs, and $75,000 for a consumer education
initiative, Attorney General  Paula T. Dow  said in a statement.
Under the accord, Wal-Mart didn’t admit  liability .  “This settlement puts the onus on Wal-Mart to check
expiration dates when stocking its shelves, to periodically
recheck stocked items, and then remove from sale any infant
formula or non-prescription drugs that are past expiration,”
Dow said in the statement. “We expect full compliance at Wal-
Mart’s 54 New Jersey stores.”  New Jersey sued Wal-Mart, Target Corp., and Drug Fair Group
Inc. in 2008, alleging they violated the state Consumer Fraud
Act and Weights and Measures Act, according to the statement.
Target settled in November 2009 by agreeing to pay $375,000, and
Drug Fair declared bankruptcy before resolving the case,
according to the statement.  As part of the settlement, Wal-Mart also agreed to ensure
that it won’t sell merchandise for more than its posted price.  “Our customers depend on us to provide a good shopping
experience with products and prices they can trust, so we’re
committed to doing even more to make sure correct prices are
posted and to remove products from our shelves well before their
expiration dates,” spokesman Greg Rossiter said.  “We also will conduct random price accuracy checks in
stores throughout the state,” he said.  The case is Paula T. Dow v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., HUD-C-
132-08, Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Hudson
County (Jersey City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
