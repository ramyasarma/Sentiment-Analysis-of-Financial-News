The Federal Reserve urged U.S.
regulators to write rules on credit risk that are tailored to
different types of securitized loans instead of uniform measures
for all kinds of assets.  “Simple credit risk retention rules, applied uniformly
across assets of all types, are unlikely to achieve the stated
objective of the Act -- namely, to improve the asset-backed
securitization process and protect investors from losses
associated with poorly underwritten loans,” the Fed’s Board of
Governors said today in a report required by the Dodd-Frank
financial-overhaul law enacted in July.  “Thus, consistent with the flexibility provided in the
statute, the Board recommends that rulemakers consider crafting
credit-risk retention requirements that are tailored to each
major class of securitized assets,” the Fed said.  The study was required within 90 days of enactment, and the
regulations “must be jointly prescribed” by the Fed and other
agencies within 270 days of the July 21 enactment, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
