Hong Kong stocks rose, driving up
the Hang Seng Index for the first time in three days, as
increases in oil and metal prices boosted commodity producers
higher and a brokerage upgrade boosted Citic Pacific Ltd.  Jiangxi Copper Co. , China’s No. 1 miner of the metal,
surged 6.3 percent. Cnooc Ltd., the nation’s largest offshore
oil producer, advanced 1.1 percent. Citic Pacific, an arm of
China’s biggest state-owned investment company, surged 7.4
percent after Citigroup Inc. raised its rating to “buy” from
“sell.” HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest lender, rose 1.2
percent, and  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. , China’s No. 2
insurer, gained 3 percent.  The  Hang Seng Index  rose 1.3 percent to 23,763.73 at the
close, snapping a two-day, 1.6 percent drop. Almost eight stocks
advanced for each one that fell on the 45-member gauge. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese
companies gained 1.1 percent to 13,573.60.  “The market sentiment is pretty positive,” said  Steve Tse ,
a Hong Kong-based research manager at BEA Union Investment
Management. The market retreated yesterday, but the “positive
momentum hasn’t finished,” he said. The Hang Seng Index fell
1.2 percent yesterday.  Jiangxi Copper rose 6.3 percent to HK$22.90.  Zijin Mining
Group Co. , China’s largest gold producer, advanced 2.3 percent
to HK$7.63, while Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s No.
1 producer of the lightweight metal, increased 1.9 percent to
HK$8.17.  Biggest Gain  Citic Pacific  surged 7.4 percent to HK$21.30, the biggest
gain on the Hang Seng Index. Citigroup raised its rating on the
stock to and said it was becoming more bullish on the company’s
Sino Iron project in Western Australia. Citigroup also increased
its share-price estimate to HK$24 from HK$15.90.  The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including
aluminum and copper rose 0.5 percent yesterday, while crude oil

$83.08 a barrel, the highest settlement since Oct. 6.  Cnooc rose 1.1 percent to HK$16.34.  PetroChina Co. , the
country’s biggest oil company, climbed 1.6 percent to HK$10.04.
A measure of materials companies had the second-steepest gain
among the Hang Seng Composite Index’s 11 industry groups.  The  Hang Seng Index  increased 3.6 percent last week, the
most since the period ended Feb. 26, as commodity producers
climbed and as lenders gained after Chinese bank loans increased.
Shares on the gauge trade at an average 15.2 times  estimated
earnings  compared with about 17.2 times at the start of the year.  Financials Gain  HSBC rose 1.2 percent to HK$81.80, the biggest contributor
to the Hang Seng Index’s advance, following a two-day, 3.8
percent slump.  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. , China’s second-
largest insurer, gained 3 percent to HK$85.40. It fell 4.9
percent in the past two days.  “Financials were lagging behind,” BEA Union’s Tse said.
“Investors used to be hesitant, but now they’re trying to catch
up. But the upside is still limited, and people could wait a
long time before generating returns.”  Financial companies in the  Hang Seng Composite Index 
accounted for 30 percent of the gauge’s 1.2 percent advance
today. A measure of financials in the composite index has
climbed 16 percent in the past three months, the third-worst
performance of 16 industry groups.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index increased 1.4 percent to
23,810.  To contact the reporter on this story:
