France’s Prime Minister Francois
Fillon said it will take “four to five days” for the country’s
fuel supplies to return to normal, television channel LCI
reported today on its website, citing a speech to lawmakers.  Fillon also said that about one-third of France’s regions,
or departements, are currently having problems with their fuel
supply because of strikes over planned pension reform and
refinery stoppages, LCI reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
