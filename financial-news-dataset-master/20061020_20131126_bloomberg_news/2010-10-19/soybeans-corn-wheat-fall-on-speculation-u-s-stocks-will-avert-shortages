Soybeans fell the most in two weeks
and corn and wheat declined on speculation that ample U.S.
stockpiles will prevent global food shortages.  Soybean supplies in the U.S. will jump to 7.2 million
metric tons in the year that started on Sept. 1, the most in
four years, and wheat inventories through May 31 will total 23.2
million tons, the second-most since 2001 behind only the prior
year, Department of Agriculture data show. Corn stockpiles on
Aug. 31 totaled 43.4 million tons, the most since 2006.  “Luckily, the U.S. has ample stockpiles,” said  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London. “Without
that we’d be in the same situation as we were two years ago”
when riots occurred because of food shortages and rising prices,
she said.  Soybeans for January delivery fell 13.75 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $11.8125 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of trade. A close at that price would be the
biggest decline since Oct. 1. The most-active contract has
dropped 1.5 percent in the past three sessions.  Corn futures for December delivery fell for a fifth
straight session, dropping 5.25 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $5.52
a bushel in Chicago. The price has declined 6.1 percent since
reaching a two-year high of $5.88 on Oct. 13.  Dry weather last week allowed farmers to collect corn and
soybeans, the USDA said in a report yesterday. About 68 percent
of the corn crop was harvested, up from 51 percent a week
earlier, and 83 percent of soybeans were collected, up from 67
percent a week earlier, USDA data showed.  Wheat Declines  Growers may harvest a record 3.408 billion bushels of
soybeans, compared with 3.483 billion forecast in September and
3.359 billion last year, according to the government.  Wheat futures for December delivery lost 8.25 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $6.8175 a bushel in Chicago.  Rice futures for November delivery also erased earlier
gains, declining 0.5 cent to $13.70 per hundred pounds. A close
lower today would be the first decline in six sessions.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on the NYSE
Liffe exchange in Paris fell 2.1 percent to 209.25 euros
($289.27) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
