The Boston Red Sox want to shorten
right field in Fenway Park by 10 feet as part of bullpen
renovations, the  Boston Herald reports .  The Red Sox are seeking to widen the bullpen in Major
League Baseball’s oldest stadium by about eight feet, pending
approval from the  Boston Landmarks Commission  during its Oct. 26
meeting. The move will shorten the distance from home plate to
the fence in right center to 370 feet from 380 feet, the
newspaper said.  The Red Sox said in an e-mailed statement that they are
“still in the process of exploring additional plans for the
2010-2011 offseason improvements” and  declined to comment on
the Herald report.  The current bullpens in 99-year-old Fenway Park were added
in 1940. The renovations also include the addition of 49 seats
on top of the right-field grandstand, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
