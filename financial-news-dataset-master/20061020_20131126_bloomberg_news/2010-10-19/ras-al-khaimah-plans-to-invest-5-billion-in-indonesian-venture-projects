Ras Al Khaimah, one of the
sheikhdoms of the United Arab Emirates, plans to invest $5
billion in Indonesian construction projects as part of a joint
venture with Trimex Group.  MEC Holdings , the venture overseeing all of Ras Al Khaimah
and Dubai-based Trimex’s Indonesian projects, will spend $1
billion to build 130 kilometers (81 miles) of railway on
Indonesia’s part of Borneo island, Executive Vice Chairman  Madhu Koneru  said today. The link will be able to transport as much as
64 million metric tons of coal a year, he said.  “Construction will start in 2012 and we expect to complete
the project in 2014,” Koneru said in an interview in Jakarta
after meeting Alwi Shihab, Indonesia’s special envoy to the
Middle East.  Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, is trying to
attract investment in infrastructure as President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  seeks to deliver average growth of 6.6 percent over
the remainder of his second and final term ending in 2014.  MEC Holdings will also invest $500 million to develop a
coal mine in Muara Wahau, East Kalimantan province, and build a
port with an annual capacity up to 34 million tons, Koneru said.  The venture will team up with  National Aluminum Co.  to
build a 500,000-ton aluminum smelter and power plant in East
Kalimantan, according to Koneru. That investment may total as
much as $3.5 billion, he said.  -- With assistance from Yoga Rusmana in Jakarta. Editors:
