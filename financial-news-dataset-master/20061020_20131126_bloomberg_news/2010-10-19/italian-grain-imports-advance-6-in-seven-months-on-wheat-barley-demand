Italy’s grain imports in the first
seven months of 2010 rose 6 percent on demand for soft wheat and
barley, the national cereal-industry association said.  Inbound shipments from January to July climbed to 6.73
million metric tons from 6.34 million tons in the year-earlier
period, the Rome-based Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti, known
as Anacer, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Italy is the European Union’s largest buyer of grain from
outside the 27-nation bloc, partly because of requirements for
durum wheat to make pasta.  Imports of soft wheat, used for bread and animal feed, rose
10 percent to 2.59 million tons, while barley imports surged 43
percent to 502,650 tons. Shipments of durum slipped 4.3 percent
to 1.23 million tons.  Italian cereal-industry exports, including risotto rice and
processed products such as pasta, climbed 6.4 percent to 2.29
million tons, the figures showed.  Grain imports in the first seven months were valued at 1.39
billion euros ($1.92 billion) and exports amounted to 1.48
billion euros, resulting in a cereal-industry trade surplus of
94.5 million euros for the period, down from 100.2 million euros
a year earlier, Anacer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
