Commodity assets under management
rose to a record $320 billion last month, from $293 billion a
month earlier, Barclays Capital said.  Investment flows reached $8.5 billion in September, the
third-highest figure ever recorded, and took new money in the
third quarter to $10.8 billion, the bank said in a report today.
Investments linked to commodity indexes attracted $7.5 billion
in the quarter, medium-term notes $1.9 billion and exchange-
traded products $1.4 billion, Barclays said.  “The fundamentals of most commodities, many of which
remain fraught with supply-side issues, continue to act as
attractive magnets for long-term asset allocation,” the
Barclays analysts said in the report.  The S&P GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw materials,
tracking the net amount investors received, advanced 8.3 percent
in the third quarter, rebounding after two consecutive quarterly
declines. Wheat, sugar and corn were the biggest gainers and
natural gas, cocoa and cattle the biggest losers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
