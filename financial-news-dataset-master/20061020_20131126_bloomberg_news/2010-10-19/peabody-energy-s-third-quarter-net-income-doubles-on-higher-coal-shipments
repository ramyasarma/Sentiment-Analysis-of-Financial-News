Peabody Energy Corp. , the largest
U.S. coal producer, said third-quarter profit more than doubled
as shipments of the fuel increased.  Net income climbed to $224.1 million, or 83 cents a share,
from $106.8 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier, St. Louis-
based Peabody said today in a statement. The company was
expected to earn 93 cents a share, according to the median of
nine analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 12
percent to $1.86 billion from $1.67 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Gregory Boyce , 56, profited from
higher metallurgical coal prices and increased shipments as the
economy recovered from the worst recession since the 1930s. U.S.
raw steel  output  averaged 1.712 million tons during the quarter,
up 23 percent from a year earlier, according to the American
Iron and Steel Institute.  “The earnings result is mildly positive,” said Daniel
Scott, an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York. “Their
production at Powder River Basin looks to be pretty strong.”  Peabody fell 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $51.34 at 12:48
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 14 percent this year.  Powder River  Spot prices in the Powder River Basin, which holds the
largest and least expensive U.S. coal reserves, have risen 60
percent this year, according to Peabody.  The company has sold 90 percent of its 2011 production from
the basin, Boyce said on a conference call with analysts. The
company is exporting coal from the basin to Europe, Peabody said
on the call, without providing additional detail.  Metallurgical coal is used to produce steel, while the
thermal form of the fuel is consumed by utilities to generate
electricity.  Peabody raised the lower end of its full-year earnings
targets, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization forecast to range between $1.85 billion and $1.9
billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.95 to $3.15,
excluding currency adjustments.  Third-quarter Ebitda totaled $571.3 million, up 67 percent
from a year ago, the company said. Peabody projected in July
that third-quarter Ebitda would be $475 million to $550 million.  Revenue in Australia jumped 36 percent to $733.4 million.
Peabody sold 7.4 tons of coal in the country, up from 6.5 tons
last year.  The company said it plans to sell 240 million to 260
million tons of coal this year, compared with 243.6 million in
2009, because of increased demand in the Asia Pacific region.  Arch Coal Inc. , also based in St. Louis, is the second-
biggest U.S. coal producer, followed by  Alpha Natural Resources
Inc. , in Abingdon, Virginia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
