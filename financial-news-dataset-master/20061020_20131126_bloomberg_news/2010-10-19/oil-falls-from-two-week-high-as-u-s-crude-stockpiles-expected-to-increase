Crude oil tumbled the most in eight
months after China raised benchmark interest rates, potentially
crimping demand in the world’s biggest energy-using country, and
the dollar rose against the euro.  Futures dropped 4.3 percent on the first increase in
China’s key lending and deposit rates since 2007 following an
acceleration in inflation to the fastest pace in 22 months. The
dollar advanced versus the European currency on speculation the
Chinese move will reduce economic growth. A rising greenback
curbs investor demand for raw materials.  “The surprise Chinese rate hike has sent the dollar higher
and that’s pushing oil lower,” said  Carl Larry , president of
Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “It’s a double whammy,
this could cause weaker demand along with strengthening the
dollar.”  Crude oil for November delivery fell $3.59 to settle at
$79.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
drop since Feb. 4. The November contract expires tomorrow. More-
actively traded December futures slipped $3.64, or 4.3 percent,
to end the session at $80.16.  Prices declined from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles increased 2.32 million barrels to 364.8 million.
November oil was down $3.62, or 4.4 percent, to $79.46 a barrel
in electronic trading at 4:35 p.m.  Gasoline for November delivery tumbled 10.32 cents, or 4.8
percent, to $2.0483 a gallon on the Nymex. It was the biggest
one-day decline since July 8, 2009. November heating oil fell
8.68 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $2.1893 a gallon.  A report on Oct. 21 may show that China’s inflation
quickened to 3.6 percent in September, highlighting overheating
risks that have prompted the government to curb credit.  Slower Growth  “Tightening of Chinese monetary policy is weighing on
crude oil and the entire commodity space,” said  Jason Schenker ,
the president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based
energy consultant. “Increased lending rates and deposit
requirements will reduce available liquidity in the market and
could engender slower growth, adversely affecting demand.”  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index of 19 commodities
dropped 1.9 percent to 292.98. Fourteen of the commodities
declined and five gained.  The Chinese announcement helped send equities lower. Stocks
also declined amid concern that banks will be forced to buy back
soured mortgages. The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index slipped 1.8
percent to 1,163.97 at 3:50 p.m. in New York, and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  decreased 1.7 percent to 10,956.86.  Dollar Rises  The U.S. currency rose for a third day, surging 1.5 percent
against the euro to $1.3722. The dollar is heading for the
biggest gain since Aug. 11.  “The dollar is rocketing higher at the moment,” said
 Stephen Schork , president of consultant Schork Group Inc. in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. “That is also putting a lot of
pressure on the market.”  An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
that U.S. crude-oil stockpiles climbed 1.5 million barrels last
week, according to the median of 15 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. That would leave supplies at the highest
level since the week ended June 25.  In France, unions have stepped up pressure on President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  to retreat from a plan to raise the retirement
age to 62 from 60. Truckers blocked highways and police were
deployed to prevent strikers from stopping fuel deliveries.  Market ‘Oversupplied’  “The U.S. is oversupplied for the moment,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research at  Commerzbank AG  in
Frankfurt. “I don’t think the effects of the French strikes are
positive for the market. It might lead to lower demand because
these refineries are not asking for crude.”  Total SA, Europe’s biggest refiner, said about 1,000 of the
4,000 service stations it operates in France are facing
shortages of one or more fuel products because of the strike.  Christine de Champeaux , a spokeswoman, said by telephone
that protesters also demonstrated in front of at least three
fuel depots today.  Brent crude oil for December settlement declined $3.27, or
3.9 percent, to end the session at $81.10 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the biggest
drop since June 4.  Oil is likely to trade in the low-to mid-$80 range next
year,  Daniel Yergin , chairman of  IHS -Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, said today at a conference in Naples, Florida. One
of the biggest influences on prices in the near term may be
currency movements, said Yergin, who was speaking at the Global
Financial Leadership Conference, presented by the CME Group.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 784,724 contracts as of 3:40
p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 677,631 contracts yesterday,
1.2 percent below the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.45 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
