CEZ AS will probably pick the winner
of the tender for building two nuclear reactors at the Temelin
power plant a year later than originally planned, the Czech
government’s special energy envoy Vaclav Bartuska said in an
interview.  State-controlled CEZ, which was supposed to submit detailed
technical documentation to bidders Westinghouse Electric Co.,
Areva SA and a Russian-Czech group led by ZAO Atomstroyexport
this month, will not do so until 2011, Bartuska said. The
bidders will submit their proposals in 2012 and the winner will
be chosen in 2013, Bartuska said.  The delay is based on a mutual agreement between CEZ and
the bidders who need more time to prepare their proposals,
according to the envoy. Their proposals so far have not
fulfilled CEZ’s expectations, he said.  “It’s possible that in 2013 CEZ decides not to pick any of
the bidders,” Bartuska said. “It’s not written in stone that
that there has to be a winner in 2013.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
