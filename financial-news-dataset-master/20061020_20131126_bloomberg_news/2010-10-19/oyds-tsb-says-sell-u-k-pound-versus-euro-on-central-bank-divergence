Investors should sell the pound
against the euro, targeting 98 pence, according to Lloyds
Banking Group Plc.  “Though the path towards a Nov. 4 Monetary Policy
Committee decision favoring more quantitative easing still
features many obstacles, in our view investors will price in a
more than 50 percent probability that asset purchases will be
resumed,”  Adrian Schmidt , a foreign-exchange strategist at
Lloyds in London, wrote in a research note today. “Though the
European Central Bank is still not expected to start raising
rates until June 2011, the policy divide with the MPC has become
more accentuated.”  Investors should abandon the trade if the pound strengthens
to 85.75 pence per euro, Schmidt said.  The pound was 0.1 percent weaker at 87.84 pence per euro as
of 2:26 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
