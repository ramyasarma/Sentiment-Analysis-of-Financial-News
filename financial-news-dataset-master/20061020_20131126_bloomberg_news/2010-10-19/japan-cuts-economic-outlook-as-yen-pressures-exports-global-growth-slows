Japan’s government downgraded its
assessment of the economy for the first time in 20 months as a
rising yen and slower global demand put increasing pressure on
an already slowing export-led expansion.  The rebound is “pausing,” the Cabinet Office said in a
monthly report in Tokyo today, removing last month’s reference
to the economy “picking up.”  The  Finance Ministry ’s first intervention in the  currency
market  since 2004 and interest rate cuts by the  Bank of Japan 
have failed to arrest the yen’s advance to a 15-year high
against the dollar. Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  endorsed a 5.1
trillion ($63 billion) yen stimulus package this month to help
shield the economy from the threat of the rising currency.  The economy will stay weak “for a while” and risks to the
outlook include a deterioration in overseas economies, the
report said. The government pledged to work closely with the
central bank, which established a 5 trillion asset-purchasing
fund on Oct. 5, and said it expects the BOJ to support the
economy with “appropriate and flexible” measures.  The Cabinet Office cut its evaluation of exports for a
second month, saying that shipments to  Asia  have been
“weakening.” The government also downgraded its assessment of
industrial production, saying it is “weak,” after factory
output in August unexpectedly dropped for a third month.  Even so, the government raised its assessment of housing
investment for the first time since March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
