European stocks  fell the most in two
weeks, led by basic-resources and technology shares, after
China raised its benchmark interest rate and Apple Inc.’s
earnings forecast missed analyst estimates.  Rio Tinto Group and Xstrata Plc fell more than 3 percent as
the People’s Bank of China increased its lending and deposit
rates for the first time since 2007. ARM Holdings Plc, the
designer of chips that power Apple’s iPhone, sank 2.6 percent.
Banks limited declines as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. reported earnings excluding one-time items that
topped analyst estimates.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  lost 0.5 percent to 265.24 as of
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the biggest drop since Oct. 4.
The gauge has climbed 2.1 percent this month, closing at the
highest level since April yesterday, amid speculation that the
Federal Reserve will announce further plans to stimulate
economic growth at its November meeting.  “Today’s action by the PBOC will likely have a negative
impact on risk assets worldwide,”  Pierre Lapointe , a global
macro strategist at Brockhouse & Cooper Inc., which manages $500
million in Montreal, wrote in a report. “Chinese monetary
policy was inappropriately expansionist given the strength of
the country’s recovery.”  National benchmark indexes declined in 15 of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100  and France’s CAC 40
slid 0.7 percent. Germany’s DAX fell 0.4 percent.  Mining Companies Fall  Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company,
dropped 3.2 percent to 3,948 pence. Xstrata slid 4.4 percent to
1,248.5 pence. A gauge of basic-resource shares retreated 2.5
percent, the biggest decline among 19  industry groups  in the
Stoxx 600.  China, the biggest consumer of copper, said the  one-year
deposit rate  will increase to 2.5 percent from 2.25 percent and
the lending rate will increase to 5.56 percent from 5.31
percent, effective tomorrow. China’s inflation quickened to 3.5
percent in August, highlighting overheating risks that have
prompted the government to curb credit and clamp down on the
real-estate market.  ARM fell 2.6 percent to 388.7 pence. Apple forecast profit
will be about $4.80 a share in the fourth quarter, which
includes the yearend holiday shopping season. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg had predicted profit of $5.03. Apple has exceeded
analysts’ earnings projections every quarter since at least
2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Season  Of the 15 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have announced
results since Oct. 7, 10 have  beaten analyst estimates  for per-
share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the
U.S., 39 of the 47 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies that
have announced results in the same period have topped forecasts,
the data show. Analysts predict 24 percent growth in third-
quarter profit from a year earlier for S&P 500 companies, a
fourth straight increase, Bloomberg data show.  “Earnings are taking centre stage and investors are
ignoring background noise a bit,”  Monika Rosen , Vienna-based
head of research at UniCredit Private Bank, said on Bloomberg
Television’s Countdown with Maryam Nemazee. “If they manage to
give a better outlook for the current quarter then the market is
prepared to view the glass as being half full.”  Porsche SE  preferred shares slumped 8.7 percent to 38.97
euros after Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  said Europe’s largest automaker may put its merger
with the producer of the 911 sports car on hold.  ‘Drag On’  “It can’t be ruled out that the legal proceedings may drag
on for some time to come until a final decision is reached,”
Winterkorn, who also heads Porsche’s board, said in the text of
a speech today in Stuttgart. “For that reason, the planned
merger could possibly be delayed.” VW preferred stocks slid 1.3
percent to 90.30 euros.  Banks advanced as Goldman Sachs and bank of America
released third-quarter results.  Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s
largest lender, gained 1.8 percent to 42.20 euros. UBS AG, the
biggest Swiss bank, rose 1.7 percent to 17.58 francs.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said banks will
have until 2015 to fully implement rules on how much cash and
liquid securities they must hold to gird against a funding
shortage in a crisis. The committee also said it would review
the rules to make sure they aren’t too onerous.  SKF AB  jumped 10 to 168 kronor, the highest level since at
least 1989. The world’s largest maker of ball bearings reported
third-quarter net income of 1.39 billion kronor ($208 million),
topping the 1.18 billion-krona average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts.  Separately, SKF agreed to buy Lincoln Industrial Corp., the
100-year-old maker of lubrication pumps, for $1 billion to tap
demand for equipment in North America and Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
