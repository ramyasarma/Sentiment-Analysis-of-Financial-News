Blacks Leisure Group Plc  rose the
most in almost a year after saying it is in preliminary talks
with several parties on either a possible offer for the company
or an offer to buy some of the company’s assets or activities.  Blacks, the U.K. retailer that rejected a bid from  Sports
Direct International Plc  in March, rose as much as 8.5 pence, or
25 percent, to 42.5 pence in London trading, and traded at that
price as of 8:11 a.m. That’s the biggest intra-day gain since
November 2009. The company has a market value of 37.5 million
pounds ($59.4 million).  McQueen Ltd. has been retained by Blacks to advise the
board on the matter, Northampton, England-based company said
today in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service.  “There is no certainty that any formal offers will be
forthcoming or as to the terms on which any such offer might be
made,” the company said in the statement. “A further
announcement will be made in due course.”  In February, Blacks announced fundraising plans, which were
stayed after  Mike Ashley ’s Sports Direct made an indicative
offer, which was later withdrawn. In November 2009, Blacks got
agreement from landlords to close 88 stores and alter lease
terms for others to help avoid insolvency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
