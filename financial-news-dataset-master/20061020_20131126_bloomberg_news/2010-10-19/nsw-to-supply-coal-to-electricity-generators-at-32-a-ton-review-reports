New South Wales state will start
supplying coal to electricity generators for about A$33 a metric
ton from 2015 as part of a 17-year contract, the Australian
Financial Review reported in its Street Talk column, without
saying where it got the information. The government is planning
an A$8 billion auction of its power assets, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
