Malaysian interest rates are likely
to rise by another 50 basis points next year even as the
country’s economic rebound slows, the  Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research  said.  Its benchmark overnight policy rate is likely to remain
unchanged at 2.75 percent for the rest of this year, before
rising to 3.25 percent in 2011, the institute said in a report
today. The central bank kept its key rate unchanged on Sept. 2
after three consecutive increases, choosing to support growth as
the global rebound cooled.  Southeast Asia’s third-largest  economy  grew 10.1 percent in
the first quarter and by 8.9 percent in the second quarter as
manufacturing recovered following last year’s recession. The
government predicts gross domestic product will increase by a
slower 5 percent to 6 percent next year after growing a faster-
than-forecast 7 percent this year, according to a Ministry of
Finance report on Oct. 15.  “The global economy softened in the second quarter of
2010,” the institute said in its report. “This cyclical
slowdown is expected to persist in the second-half of 2010,
given weaker global trade conditions and the on-going sovereign
debt problem in eurozone.”  GDP may expand 6.5 percent in 2010 as a whole and 5.2
percent next year, the partially government-funded research
group said, maintaining its earlier forecasts.  Ringgit’s Rise  Exports  rose at the slowest pace in nine months in August
as weakening growth in the world’s largest economies hurt demand
for Asian goods.  The Malaysian currency is Asia’s third-best performer this
year, rising 10.8 percent against the dollar. The ringgit is
likely to average 3.20 this year before further strengthening to
3.10 in 2011, the institute said. It weakened 0.1 percent to
3.0940 per dollar at 8:52 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur today.  The institute forecast  consumer prices  will rise 2.2
percent this year and 2.5 next year.  Inflation  climbed 2.1
percent in August from a year earlier, the highest level in 15
months, as food and transport costs rose with the strengthening
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
