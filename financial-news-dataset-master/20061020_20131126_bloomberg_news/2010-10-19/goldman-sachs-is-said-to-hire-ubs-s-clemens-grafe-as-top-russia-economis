Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  has hired
 Clemens Grafe  as its chief Russia economist, according to two
people with knowledge of the move.  Grafe left his role as chief economist in Moscow for UBS AG
last week, said Richard Marton, a London-based spokesman for
UBS, in an e-mail. Goldman’s press service declined to comment.
Grafe’s mobile phone was switched off.  He will replace  Rory MacFarquhar , who was Goldman’s head
economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States
in Moscow until March, the people said. MacFarquhar moved to the
U.S. Treasury Department as an adviser on international issues,
spokesman  Andrew Williams  said March 11.  A former lecturer at the University of London’s Birbeck
College, Grafe joined UBS in 2005. He worked on Russia issues
for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and on
the International Monetary Fund-based stabilization program for
Russia throughout the 1990s, according to a  biography  compiled
by U.S. Milken Institute.  Goldman, the most profitable securities firm on Wall
Street, left Russia after the country defaulted on $40 billion
of domestic debt in 1998. The New York-based firm reopened its
Moscow office in 2007 and named  Christopher Barter  its sole
Russia chief in January.  London-based  Reinhard Cluse  will take over Grafe’s
responsibility for Russia, Morton said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
