Melky Cabrera  was released by the
Atlanta Braves less than a year after being traded to the club
from the New York Yankees.  Cabrera, 26, batted .255 with a .317 on-base percentage and
four home runs this season. He made his Major League Baseball
debut with the Yankees in 2005 and became a fan favorite on June
6, 2006, when he reached over the outfield wall and stole a home
run from Boston Red Sox outfielder  Manny Ramirez .  Cabrera batted .154 in the Yankees’ 2009 World Series win
over the Philadelphia Phillies and was traded to the Braves in
the offseason in a deal that included pitcher  Javier Vazquez .  The Braves also released 40-year-old relief pitcher  Takashi Saito , team spokesman Brad Hainje said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
