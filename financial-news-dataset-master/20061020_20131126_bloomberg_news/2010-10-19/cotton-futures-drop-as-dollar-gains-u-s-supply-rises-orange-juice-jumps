Cotton futures fell as a rallying
dollar eroded the investment appeal of some commodities and as
the harvest accelerated in the U.S., the world’s largest
exporter. Orange-juice prices gained for a third session.  The  dollar  gained as much as 1.5 percent against a basket
of six currencies after China, the biggest cotton user, raised
interest rates for the first time since 2007. Oil and gold
prices plunged, sending the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities to its biggest drop since Aug. 31. In the week ended
Oct. 17, the U.S. harvest was 41 percent complete, up from 33
percent a week earlier, government data show.  The dollar rally might lead to a “pretty good sell-off in
a lot of commodities,” said  Fain Shaffer , the president of
Infinity Trading Corp., a commodity brokerage in Medford,
Oregon. “On top of that, we’re going into the heart of harvest
for India and the U.S. Fresh supply’s coming to the market.”  Cotton for December delivery fell 2.7 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $1.1067 a pound at 9:52 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Before today, the fiber advanced 50 percent in 2010.  On Oct. 15, cotton dropped by the exchange’s limit of 5
cents after climbing to $1.198, the highest level since the
commodity started trading 140 years ago.  Prices may drop as much as 12 percent over the next three
months as harvests gather pace in the U.S. and India, the top
suppliers, helping ease a global deficit, according to  Cotton
Corp. of India .  Futures in New York may decline to $1 to $1.05 as India
resumes exports and Pakistan and Brazil gather new crops,
 Subhash Grover , the managing director of the biggest state-owned
buyer in India, said in a telephone interview from Mumbai.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 3.55 cents,
or 2.4 percent, to $1.529 a pound on ICE. Before today, the
commodity jumped 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
