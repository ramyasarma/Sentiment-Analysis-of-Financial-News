Japanese  stocks  rose after Citigroup
Inc. reported profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates, boosting
the outlook for corporate earnings. Trading houses dropped as
the price of oil declined.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.  and Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s top two banks by market value,
climbed at least 1.6 percent. Sumitomo Chemical Co., a maker of
chemical products, advanced 3.1 percent after Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. raised its investment
recommendation to “outperform.” Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s
largest commodities trader, fell 0.9 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.4 percent to
9,539.45 at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, its first advance in
three days. The broader  Topix  index gained 0.4 percent to 833.73
after falling less than 0.1 percent with about the same number
of stocks advancing as declining.  “Market sentiment is improving,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi ,
a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.
“Expectations for corporate earnings in the financial sector
are rising after the better-than-expected results at
Citigroup.”  The Topix has declined 8.1 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 6.2 percent by the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and 5
percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese
benchmark are valued at 14.9 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 14.1 times for the S&P and 12.3 times for the Stoxx.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.6 percent today. The index
rose 0.7 percent yesterday in New York to the highest level
since May 3 following Citigroup’s results and as an unexpected
drop in U.S. industrial production added to signs the Federal
Reserve will help stoke the economic recovery.  Banks Lead Gains  Banks were the  biggest support  for the Topix’s gain.
Mitsubishi UFJ rose 1.6 percent to 388 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group, Japan’s second-largest publicly traded bank,
increased 1.7 percent to 2,400 yen. Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,
the No. 3, climbed 2.6 percent to 120 yen.  Upward revisions in corporate earnings are expected ahead
of mid-term company reports because of lower credit costs and
improvement in revenue,  Hironari Nozaki , an analyst at Citigroup
Global Markets Japan Inc., wrote in a Japanese-language report
dated today. Next week is Japan’s busiest period for half-year
earnings statements, according to Bloomberg data.  “Japanese banks are at their recent low levels, so the
stocks are rebounding,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. “If the economy gets better,
interest rates rise and more people borrow money, we can expect
a long-term increase in bank shares.”  Sumitomo Chemical Jumps  A  gauge  that includes Japanese banks traded at 112.73, 1.8
percent higher than this year’s low of 110.71 reached on Oct. 4.  Sumitomo Chemical jumped 3.1 percent to 366 yen, the
highest close since Sept. 30. The company had its rating raised
to “outperform” from “neutral” at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities, which said the company’s earnings forecast
is “conservative.” The brokerage’s analyst Shuichi Nakahara
raised his estimate for full-year operating profit to 88 billion
yen ($1.08 billion) from 71 billion yen.  Nintendo Co. , the world’s biggest maker of portable video-
game players, advanced 0.9 percent to 21,030 yen. The company
was rated “overweight” in new coverage by Hiroshi Kamide, an
analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Nintendo’s 3DS handheld game
player will help boost the stock, Kamide said in a Japanese-
language report dated today. He set a 12-month share price
estimate at 27,000 yen.  Tepco Share Sale  An increase in the number of Tokyo Electric Power Co.
stocks after the company’s share sale will be reflected on the
Topix index tomorrow. Investors who use the Topix index as a
benchmark may sell stocks to get funds to buy Tepco shares, said
 Yoshifumi Kikuchi , head of the dealing division at Tokyo-based
Nissan Century Securities Co.  Tepco, Asia’s largest electricity generator, said on Sept.
29 it plans to raise as much as 555 billion yen by issuing
254.15 million shares in Japan and overseas.  Trading companies  and petroleum producers dropped,
reversing gains, as the price of oil slid. Mitsubishi Corp.,
Japan’s largest commodities trader, fell 0.9 percent, reversing
an advance of 0.8 percent. Mitsui & Co., Japan’s No. 2 trading
house, sank 1 percent to 1,329 yen. Inpex Corp., Japan’s biggest
oil-explorer, declined 1.1 percent after rising as much as 1.4
percent.  Crude oil for November delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent
to $82.58 a barrel in electronic trading in New York today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
