Lithium demand may triple in the
next decade as consumers buy more portable electronics and
battery-powered vehicles, said  James D. Calaway , chairman of
lithium miner  Orocobre Ltd.   Global lithium demand of about 110,000 metric tons may
double by 2020 solely from existing applications such as mobile
phones and glass making, Calaway said yesterday in an interview
at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. Sales to electric-vehicle
battery makers will add 10,000 tons by 2015 before increasing
more rapidly, he said.  “You could very easily see by 2020 the need to triple
production or even more just to accommodate the auto sector,”
Calaway said.  Orocobre will begin producing lithium in 2012 at its first
project, Salar de Olaroz, atop salt flats in Argentina’s Jujuy
province, he said. The company should become  profitable  the next
year when output reaches 15,000 tons of lithium and 36,000 tons
of potash fertilizer, he said. The Brisbane, Australia-based
company may start pumping lithium-rich water from a second mine
in Argentina in 2014, said Calaway, 53.  The second project, called Salar de Salinas Grandes, will
boost Orocobre’s total annual lithium production to as much as
40,000 tons, making it the world’s fourth-biggest producer,
Calaway said.  Toyota Partnership  Toyota Tsusho Corp., an affiliate of Toyota Motor Corp., is
financing the $100 million to $120 million cost of Salar de
Olaroz in exchange for a 25 percent stake in the project. Toyota
also may market the mine’s lithium for Orocobre to Asian
manufacturers, he said. Salinas Grandes may cost as much as $150
million and will be financed from cash generated by the first
mine or with partners such as Toyota, Calaway said.  Prices for lithium carbonate, the processed form of the
mineral used in lithium-ion batteries, are likely to remain in a
range of $4,000 to $6,000 a ton, Calaway said. Prices fell last
year as much as 20 percent from a peak of about $6,500 in 2008,
and have climbed back to about $6,000, he said.  Prices may drop through 2015 if capacity increases faster
than demand, Calaway said.  “We are managing our business with the assumption that
it’s going to be fairly tough” through 2014, Calaway said.
“And then I think we get into a fairly substantial period where
you get very strong firming of prices. From 2015 through 2025,
it is going to be a wonderful time to have low-cost lithium
production.”  Orocobre’s cost of production will be less than output from
lithium rock mines, primarily in Australia, that comprise 35
percent of global output, he said.  Orocobre  fell 20 cents, or 8 percent, to C$2.29 yesterday
in Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
