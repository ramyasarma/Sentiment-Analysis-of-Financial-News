Mauritania expelled 14 foreign
workers employed by First Quantum Minerals Ltd. at the Guelb
Moghrein copper-gold mine because it hadn’t informed the
government of their arrival, AMI, the state-owned press agency,
reported, citing Mohamed Lemine Ould Mustapha, the director of
the mining police.  The workers had arrived since Oct. 7, the news agency said.
Mauritania wants to curb the number of foreign workers at its
mines, Abdellahi Ould Oudaa, the mines minister, said last week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
