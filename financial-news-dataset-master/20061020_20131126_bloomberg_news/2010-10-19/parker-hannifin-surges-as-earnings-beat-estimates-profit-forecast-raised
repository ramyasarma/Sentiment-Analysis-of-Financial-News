Parker Hannifin Corp. , a maker of
valves and pumps used in factory equipment, rose the most in
five months after boosting its annual profit forecast amid a
rebound in U.S. manufacturing.  Full-year earnings from continuing operations will be as
much as $5.80 a share, the company said today, up from an August
 projection  of at most $4.40. Profit more than tripled to $1.51 a
share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, exceeding  analysts ’ average
estimate of $1.06.  “The industrials have been leading this recovery and
clearly there’s no sign of that slowing here,” said  Stephen Volkmann , a New York-based analyst with Jefferies & Co. who
recommends holding the shares.  Parker Hannifin, based in Cleveland, produces hundreds of
thousands of parts used in factories, as well as in heavy trucks
and aircraft. About 45 percent of sales come from outside the
U.S., making it a barometer for the global industrial economy.
Manufacturing has led the U.S. economy from the worst recession
since the 1930s.  Parker Hannifin gained $3.86, or 5.3 percent, to $76.28 at
10:08 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after
earlier touching $78.71 for the biggest intraday increase since
May 10. The stock gained the second-most on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index after Massey Energy Co.  Replenishing Inventory  Manufacturing during the recovery, which began in June
2009, was boosted by climbing exports, improving business
investment and replenishing inventory. U.S. manufacturing grew
more slowly in September than the month before, according to the
Institute for Supply Management’s  factory index.   Orders for the most recent quarter climbed 29 percent from
a year earlier, Parker said. They rose 31 percent in the North
American industrial segment and 34 percent in the international
industrial segment.  The pace of growth has slowed from the quarter ended June
30, when overall orders increased 35 percent, and rose 46
percent in both the North American and global industrial
divisions.  Parker Hannifin’s  net income  increased to $247.2 million,
or $1.51 a share, from $73.5 million, or 45 cents, a year
earlier, Parker said in a statement. Revenue rose 26 percent to
$2.83 billion, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $2.65 billion.  ‘Off the Charts’  Analysts had predicted earnings of $4.49, on average, for
the year ending in June 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Most people expected a good quarter out of these guys,
meaning some beat and some raise, but this is just off the
charts,” said Volkmann.  Sales in the industrial North America division increased 36
percent to $1.06 billion, and revenue in the industrial
international segment climbed 29 percent to $1.09 billion,
according to the statement.  The company has about 55,000 workers. About half are
employed by foreign subsidiaries, according to the company’s
annual regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
