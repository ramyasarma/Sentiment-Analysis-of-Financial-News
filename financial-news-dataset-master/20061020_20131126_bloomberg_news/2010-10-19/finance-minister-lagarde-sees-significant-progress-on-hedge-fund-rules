French Finance Minister Christine
Lagarde said European Union finance ministers made “significant
progress” in agreeing to tougher hedge-fund and private-equity

told a briefing in Luxembourg today. “Have we realized a big
jump in qualitative terms? The answer is yes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
