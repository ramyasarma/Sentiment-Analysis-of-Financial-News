Mexican authorities carried out the
biggest marijuana bust in the country’s history yesterday, the
government’s security spokesman Alejandro Poire said.  The 105 tons of marijuana seized yesterday in Tijuana were
bound for the U.S., Poire told reporters in Mexico City. The
drugs were confiscated by soldiers and police in pre-dawn raids
in three neighborhoods, Mayor Jorge Ramos said in an interview
yesterday.  “We’re making a very important effort in the confiscation
and eradication of this illicit product,” Poire said in Mexico
City.  Mexico has impounded more than 7,400 tons of marijuana this
year as part of President Felipe Calderon’s fight against drug
cartels, Poire said. Drug-related violence in Mexico has killed
more than 28,000 people since Calderon took office in late 2006,
including politicians and police chiefs.  Ramos said the country needs to overhaul its court system
to guarantee success in the war on drug cartels. As mayor of
Tijuana, Ramos fired 600 police suspected of corruption in a
period of 22 months, and 200 of them were imprisoned, he said.  “The same practice should be applied to the court
system,” he said. “To clean up, to purge, to hold accountable
those who collaborate with criminals.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
