             Boeing Co. , the world’s second-
biggest commercial-jet maker, is set to win an order from
Emirates Airline at the Farnborough Air Show, according to two
people familiar with the agreement.  
 The Dubai government-owned carrier and the Chicago-based
 planemaker  will announce an order for about 20 777s wide-body
jets tomorrow, said one of the people, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the agreement has not yet been announced. The
deal would be valued at almost $5 billion at list prices.  
 Emirates, the biggest Arab airline, said last month it will
announce new aircraft orders at the show. The company also last
month placed an order for 32 Airbus SAS A380 superjumbo jets,
valued at $11 billion, as it seeks to expand its position as the
world’s largest international airline, funneling passengers
through its Dubai base.  
 Middle Eastern carriers including Emirates and Qatar
Airways Ltd. have become major buyers of commercial aircraft as
they seek to use their geographical advantage to build a global
network. Emirates can reach 95 percent of the world’s population
from Dubai on an A380, Airbus said yesterday.  
 Emirates’ order of additional A380 superjumbo will push its
fleet to 90 of the world’s largest passenger jet. The Boeing 777
typically seats between 300 and 400 passengers, making it the
company’s second-largest commercial jet behind the 747 jumbo.
Boeing is bringing its smaller 787 Dreamliner to the Farnborough
Air show, and the aircraft landed today in its first appearance
in Europe.  
 Airbus Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said yesterday
that he aims to double the 131 orders received so far this year
during the air show. Airbus unseated Boeing as the world’s
largest maker of passenger jets in 2003.
