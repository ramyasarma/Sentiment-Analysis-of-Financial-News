             Tiger Woods switched back to his old
putter for today’s final round of the British Open at St.
Andrews.  
 Woods changed to a Nike Method putter prior to the
tournament in an effort to conquer the slower greens of the Old
Course. He took 99 putts in his first three rounds, including 35
yesterday, to fall 12 shots behind leader Louis Oosthuizen.  
 Woods today returned to the Titleist Scotty Cameron putter
which helped him win 13 of his 14 majors championships since
1999.
