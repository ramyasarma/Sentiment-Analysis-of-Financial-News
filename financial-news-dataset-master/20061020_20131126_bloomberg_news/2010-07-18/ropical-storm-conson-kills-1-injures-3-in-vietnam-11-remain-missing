             One person was killed in northern
Vietnam and three injured as tropical storm Conson struck the
Southeast Asian nation yesterday, the National Committee for
Flood and Storm Control said today on its website.  
 Eleven people remained missing at 6 a.m., the committee
said. Thousands were evacuated while the storm also destroyed
303 homes and 27 boats, according to the statement.  
 The Vietnamese navy searched for six fishermen near the
Paracels islands, Reuters  reported .  
 The army sent 3,500 soldiers to help evacuate people in
coastal areas and move others from four mountainous provinces
due to the threat of flash floods, Reuters reported, citing
state-run Voice of Vietnam radio.  
 Vietnam Airlines said it would resume operations today and
planned additional flights for passengers from the 10 flights
that were canceled yesterday, Reuters said.
