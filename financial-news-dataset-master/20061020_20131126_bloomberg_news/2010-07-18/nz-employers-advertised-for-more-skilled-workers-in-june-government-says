             New Zealand employers advertised
for more skilled workers in June, according to a government
report.  
 Demand for skilled workers rose 10 percent in the three
months ended June 30, Employment Minister Paula Bennett said in
a statement, citing an index published by the Department of
Labour. The index is based on vacancies posted on the nation’s
three largest recruitment Web sites.
