             American International Group Inc. is
expected to announce tomorrow that it will name Mark Tucker as
head of its AIA Group Ltd. unit, replacing Mark Wilson, the
Financial Times reported.  
 Wilson is likely to remain with AIA until the year’s end,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the
situation. Robert Benmosche, AIG’s chief executive officer, is
seeking to speed up the sale of assets, the FT said.  
 A planned initial public offering of the Asian unit is
unlikely to be delayed by a change in chief executives since
Tucker, a former CEO of Prudential Plc, is known to investors,
the newspaper said.  
 AIG declined to comment, the FT reported.
