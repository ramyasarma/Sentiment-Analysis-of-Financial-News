             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. 
declined the most in almost eight weeks after a U.S. Court
denied a motion by the world’s largest maker of generic drugs to
overturn a jury verdict on the validity of a Wyeth patent.  
 The shares dropped  as much as  3.2 percent, the biggest drop
 since  May 26, to 206.40 shekels, and were 2.8 percent lower at
207.30 shekels at 12:43 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  
 The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey
denied a motion to overturn the April 23 ruling on the validity
of a patent for the heartburn drug Protonix that’s held by
Pfizer Inc.’s Wyeth unit.  
 Investors hoped the judge wouldn’t accept the jury’s
verdict,  David Levinson , an analyst at Bank Hapoalim Ltd. in Tel
Aviv told Bloomberg. Compensation may reach $1.2 billion, he
said.
