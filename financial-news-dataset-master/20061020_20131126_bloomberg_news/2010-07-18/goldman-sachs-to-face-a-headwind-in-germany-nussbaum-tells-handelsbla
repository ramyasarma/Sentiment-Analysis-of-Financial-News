             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  may face a
“headwind” for business in Germany even after a settlement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Handelsblatt
reported, citing Berlin Finance Senator  Ulrich Nussbaum .  
 Nussbaum said he’s “happy that the city-state of Berlin
for now has nothing more to do with Goldman Sachs and its
financial practices,” he said, according to the newspaper.  
 Goldman Sachs, based in New York, last week agreed to pay
$550 million to settle U.S. regulatory claims it misled
investors over collateralized debt obligations linked to
subprime mortgages.  
 A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs couldn’t be immediately
reached for comment outside business hours.
