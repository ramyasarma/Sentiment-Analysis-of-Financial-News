             Club Mediterranee SA  may be bought
by BMB Group in a transaction valuing the French travel company
at about 800 million euros ($1 billion), the Sunday Times
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  
 Three of Club Med’s biggest shareholders support the
planned bid by BMB Group, a company that manages money for the
Sultan of Brunei’s family, the newspaper said. They include
London-based hedge fund GLG Partners LP and Rolaco Holding, a
Saudi Arabian Investment company.  
 Thierry Orsoni , a spokesman for Club Med, wasn’t
immediately available for comment.
