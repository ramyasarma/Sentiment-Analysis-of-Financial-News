-- Housing, Leading Index in U.S. Probably Slumped in Sign Recovery Slowing

             The housing market took another step
back in June as construction and purchases dropped, and a gauge
of the outlook for growth signaled the expansion will lose
steam, economists said before reports this week.  
 Builders  began work  on 580,000 houses last month at an
annual rate, down 2.2 percent from May and the slowest pace this
year, according to the  median  estimate of 61 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News before Commerce Department data due July 20.
Other reports may show sales of  existing homes  decreased for a
second month and the index of leading indicators declined for
the first time in more than a year.  
 The expiration of a buyer tax credit has caused housing to
retreat, showing the industry that precipitated the recession
cannot sustain a recovery absent job growth. The financial
turmoil caused by the European debt crisis has shaken confidence
in the world’s largest economy, raising the risk that spending
and employment will cool.  
 “At a minimum, we’re headed for a soft patch and possibly
an extended period of slow growth,” said  Julia Coronado , a
senior economist at BNP Paribas in New York. “There is a lot of
uncertainty about where housing goes from here. Now that we’re
in the world ex-tax credits, it’s not clear how deep the pool of
demand is for housing.”  
 Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will deliver his
semiannual report on the economy to members of Congress on July
21. Policy makers last month predicted the expansion will be too
slow over the next two years to return to the 5 percent to 5.3
percent  jobless rate  that they consider full employment,
according to minutes of the meeting released last week.  
 Fewer Permits  
 Housing’s inability to maintain a rebound is one reason the
economic recovery is not gaining speed. Building  permits , a sign
of future construction, were little changed at a 575,000 annual
pace, economists project the Commerce Department’s construction
report will also show.  
 The projected drop in housing starts would follow a 10
percent decrease in May after the deadline to sign purchase
agreements, and become eligible to receive a government credit
worth as much as $8,000, lapsed on April 30.  
 Sales of existing homes fell to a 5.1 million annual rate
in June from 5.66 million the prior month, economists forecast
before a July 22 report from the National Association of
Realtors. In April, purchases reached a 5.79 million pace, the
highest level since the tax credit was originally due to expire
in November.  
 Tax Credit  
 Existing sales, which are tallied when a deal closes, may
still have been influenced by the government program last month
since the closing deadline was June 30 for those meeting the
April 30 signing cutoff. The closing deadline was extended this
month to Sept. 30 to make sure prospective buyers have enough
time to complete transactions.  
 Homebuilders turned even more pessimistic in July, the
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo  confidence
index  on July 19 may show, according to economists surveyed. The
index fell to 16 from 17 in June. Readings below 50 mean more
respondents said conditions were poor.  
 Builders compete with inventories of existing homes that
are expanding because of mounting foreclosures. Home seizures
climbed 38 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
RealtyTrac Inc. said last week, putting lenders on pace to claim
more than 1 million properties this year.  
 KB Home , the U.S. homebuilder that targets first-time
buyers, reported a wider-than-estimated loss and a drop in new
orders in its second quarter.  
 Sales Unpredictable  
 “A lack of predictability in the overall sales environment
will likely impact our full-year deliveries and could
potentially extend our outlook for profitability,” KB Home
Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Mezger  said June 25 in a
conference call.  
 Home builders have underperformed the broader stock market
this year. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite  Homebuilder
Index  has fallen about 11 percent so far this year, compared
with a 4.5 percent decline for the S&P 500 Index.  
 Housing indicators haven’t been the only ones showing
weakness of late. Manufacturing contracted in June by the most
in a year, figures from the Fed showed last week. Other reports
showed  retail sales  fell for a second month and consumer
sentiment this month declined to the lowest level in a year.  
 Firings remain elevated. A Labor Department report on
jobless claims on July 22 may show  initial claims  rose to
445,000 last week from 429,000 the prior week, economists
forecast.  
 The index of leading economic indicators probably fell 0.3
percent in June after rising 0.4 percent in May, according to
economists’ estimates before the July 22 release of the
Conference Board’s measure of the outlook for the next three to
six months.  
 Analysts have been marking down growth forecasts this
month. Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York project
the economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace from April through June,
down from their 3.2 percent estimate in early July. They also
reduced the average estimate for the second half of the year by
a half percentage point to 2.75 percent.
