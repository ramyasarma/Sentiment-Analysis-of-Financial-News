             A U.S. review of the Obama
adminstration’s order to accelerate closing of General Motors
Co. and Chrysler Group LLC car dealerships concluded it’s “not
at all clear” the action was necessary for the carmakers.  
 “It is not at all clear that the greatly accelerated pace
of the dealership closings during one of the most severe
economic downtowns in our nation’s history was either necessary
for the sake of the companies’ economic survival or prudent for
the sake of the nation’s economic recovery,” the Treasury’s
inspector general for the U.S. financial bailout said today in a
report.  
 “Treasury made a series of decisions that may have
substantially contributed to the accelerated shuttering of
thousands of small businesses and thereby potentially adding
tens of thousands of workers to the already lengthy unemployment
rolls -- all based on a theory and without sufficient
consideration of the decisions’ broader economic impact,” the
report said.
