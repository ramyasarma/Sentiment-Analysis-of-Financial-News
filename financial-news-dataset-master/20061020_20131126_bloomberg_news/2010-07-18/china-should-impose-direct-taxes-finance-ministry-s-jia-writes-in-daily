             China should impose “direct taxes”
on its people, such as personal income tax and real estate tax,
to help allocate more funds to low-income groups and narrow the
gap between rich and poor, Jia Kang, the head of the Finance
Ministry’s research institute, wrote in China Daily today.  
 Jia called on the government to make budgets more
transparent to improve financial allocation, in an opinion piece
in the newspaper.
