             Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , the
world’s biggest shipbuilder, said it will invest $48 million
building a wheel-loader factory in Shandong, China, to tap the
fast-growing market.  
 The plant, to be completed by April 2011, will have an
annual production capacity of 8,000 units, the Ulsan, South
Korea-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Hyundai
Heavy aims to sell more than 10,000 wheel loaders annually in
China within five years, the company said.  
 The Korean company will also seek to expand into Brazil,
Middle East and Africa, it said, without providing details.
