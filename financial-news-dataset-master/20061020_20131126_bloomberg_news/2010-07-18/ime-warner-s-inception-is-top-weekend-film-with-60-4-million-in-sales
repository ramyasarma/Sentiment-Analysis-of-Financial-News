             The science-fiction thriller
“Inception” was the No. 1 movie at U.S. and Canadian theaters
this weekend, taking in $62.8 million in ticket sales for  Time
Warner Inc. ’s Warner Bros.  
 “Despicable Me,” from Universal Pictures, fell to second
place with $32.8 million in its second weekend, researcher
 Hollywood.com Box-Office  said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. Among other new films, “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice”
was third with $17.6 million, Hollywood.com said.  
 “Inception,” director  Christopher Nolan ’s first film
since “The Dark Knight” was released in 2008, is the third
first-place opening for Time Warner this year. Sales were helped
by critical praise, getting a favorable evaluation from 156 of
187 reviews compiled on the fan site Rottentomatoes.com.  
 “Warner Bros. mounted a strong campaign for this picture
that enticed people,” said  Brandon Gray , president of Box
Office Mojo, a research company in Sherman Oaks, California.
“It’s the type of movie that was never going to be a slam dunk,
so all things considered, it had a very good weekend.”  
 The film stars  Leonardo Di Caprio  as a member of a special
team that enters the dreams of others to steal secrets. He takes
what he hopes will be one last job to earn enough money to
reunite with his children. Ellen Page and  Marion Cotillard  co-
star.  
 Moon Thief  
 “Despicable Me” is the story of an underworld creature
who conspires to steal the moon. The animated film features the
voices of Ken Jeong and Ranjani Brow.  
 “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” stars  Nicolas Cage  as a
sorcerer who recruits a younger aide to help him defend New York
from a rival magician. The film, from Walt Disney Co., co-stars
 Alfred Molina .  
 The movie was “unable to get over the hump” of attracting
viewers even as Disney mounted a “large” marketing campaign,
Gray said.  
 “Just because you have ads in heavy rotation, doesn’t mean
people will go see the movie,” Gray said. “What was presented
in the marketing was very generic and this is not the type of
picture that works for most people.”  
 “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,” the vampire drama starring
Taylor Lautner,  Robert Pattinson  and  Kristen Stewart , was fourth
with sales of $13.4 million. The film has brought in $264.8
million in ticket sales since its June 30 debut.  
 Daring Escape  
 “Toy Story 3” was fifth with $12 million for Disney’s
Pixar studio. The sequel brings back  Tom Hanks  as the voice of
Woody, who leads his toy companions in an escape from day care.
The movie’s ticket sales have totaled $363 million since June
18, making it a record high for Pixar. “Finding Nemo,”
released in 2003, held the previous mark for the U.S. and Canada
with $339.7 million, according to  Box Office Mojo .  
 Weekend sales for the top 12 films rose to $171.4 million
from $152.1 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Year-to-
date receipts total $6.22 billion, up 4.1 percent from $5.97
billion. Attendance has fallen 2.3 percent this year.
