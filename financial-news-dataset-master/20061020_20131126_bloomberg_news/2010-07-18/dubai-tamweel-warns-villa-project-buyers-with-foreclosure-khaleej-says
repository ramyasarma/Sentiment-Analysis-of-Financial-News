             Tamweel PJSC , Dubai’s second-biggest
Islamic mortgage company by assets, has sent letters to buyers
of “The Villa” development advising them to take possession of
their properties or face foreclosure,  Al Khaleej  reported,
citing letters it saw.  
 Dozens of buyers at the housing development, which was
completed more than two years late, refused to take possession
of the homes because the finishing of kitchens, bathrooms,
lighting and walls at the properties didn’t measure up to the
quality promised by the developer, the newspaper said.  
 Al-Mazaya Holding Co. KSCC , the project’s Kuwaiti
developer, offered to pay buyers 20,000 dirhams ($5,445) each in
compensation but hasn’t paid anyone yet, Al Khaleej reported.
