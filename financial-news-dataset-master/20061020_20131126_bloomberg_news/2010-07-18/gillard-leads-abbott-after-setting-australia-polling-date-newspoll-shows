             Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  widened her lead over the conservative coalition as the
campaign for the Aug. 21 election begins, a Newspoll shows.  
 The incumbent Labor party leads  Tony Abbott ’s Liberal-
National coalition by 10 percentage points with 55 percent of
voters preferring Gillard, up from a 53 to 47 percent split
three weeks ago after she ousted  Kevin Rudd , the Newspoll
published in the Australian newspaper today showed.  
 The approval rating for Gillard, who visited Governor-
General  Quentin Bryce  on July 17 to ask for parliament to be
dissolved today, is 48 percent compared with 36 percent for
Abbott, the poll of 1,140 voters on July 16 to 18 showed. The
margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
