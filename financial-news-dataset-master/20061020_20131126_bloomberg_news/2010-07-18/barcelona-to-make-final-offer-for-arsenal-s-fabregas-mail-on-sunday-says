             Barcelona will make a final bid of
almost 40 million pounds ($61.2 million) for Arsenal’s Spain
midfielder Cesc Fabregas, the Mail on Sunday reported, without
citing anyone.  
 The 23-year-old wants to join Barcelona, although Arsenal
manager Arsene Wenger has said he is not prepared to sell his
captain, the newspaper said.  
 Barcelona has already had a 30 million-pound bid rejected
by the Gunners, who will not consider less than 50 million
pounds, the Mail said.
