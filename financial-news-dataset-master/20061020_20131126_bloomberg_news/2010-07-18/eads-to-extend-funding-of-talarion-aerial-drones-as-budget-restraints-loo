             European Aeronautic Defence & Space
Co.  will extend funding of the Talarion aerial drone program for
at least the coming months as it waits for Germany, France and
Spain to commit funds in the face of strained defense budgets.  
 “I assume our governments will come up with priorities in
autumn, that’s the indication we get,”  Stefan Zoller , who leads
EADS’s defense division, said at a press meeting in London
yesterday. ‘Until then we will go on.”  
 EADS said in January it couldn’t fund the project beyond
the middle of this year without 1.5 billion euros ($1.85
billion) from the participating countries. Zoller said the cost
of the unmanned vehicle itself is limited because it includes
necessary infrastructure upgrades, and that Talarion would help
Europe bolster its presence in the global drone market.  
 Development and acquisition of the 45 drone systems would
cost 2.9 billion euros over several years, Zoller told
journalists ahead of the Farnborough Air show that begins
tomorrow. Turkey has also shown interest in the project and may
become a fourth nation, helping spread the cost, and the U.K.
may also have an interest in participating, he said.  
 Germany last year chose to buy Israeli unmanned spotter
aircraft for deployment in Afghan airspace, opting for the
technology over systems from the U.S. or Europe. French Defense
Minister  Herve Morin  said last month his government is talking
to the U.S. about a possible purchase of Predator drones made
General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. of the U.S.
