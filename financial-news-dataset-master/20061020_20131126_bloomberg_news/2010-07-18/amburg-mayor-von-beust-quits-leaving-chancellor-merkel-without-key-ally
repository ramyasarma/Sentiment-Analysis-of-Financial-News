             Hamburg’s Mayor  Ole von Beust 
announced his resignation after almost nine years at the helm of
the German port city, becoming the sixth state leader lost by
 Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats in the last year.  
 Von Beust  said today he’ll step down on Aug. 25 in comments
broadcast on German television stations including N-TV. It’s a
“reasonable moment” to resign after more than 32 years in
Hamburg politics and after helping steer the city-state through
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  
 He informed Merkel of his decision, he said. Hamburg’s
Interior Minister Christoph Ahlhaus will likely succeed Von
Beust, news agencies including Deutsche Presse Agentur reported.
Hamburg is ruled by a coalition of the Christian Democrats and
the Green Party, the first-ever such alliance at state level.
