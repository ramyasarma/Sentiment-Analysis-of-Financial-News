             U.S. Senate Republican Leader  Mitch McConnell  spoke out against former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan ’s call to let tax cuts passed during the
administration of President  George W. Bush  expire.  
 Congress should cut spending instead of allowing the tax
cuts to die out later this year, McConnell said today on CNN’s
“State of the Union” program. Greenspan said July 16 in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Conversations with  Judy Woodruff ” that the tax revenue is needed to reduce the federal-
budget deficit.  
 The backing of Greenspan, who led the U.S. central bank
from 1987 to 2006, helped persuade Congress to pass the tax cuts
during the Bush administration. Lawmakers are looking for ways
to spur the economic recovery, which has shown signs of slowing.  
 “We believe that the problem is not that we tax too little
but that we spend too much,” said  McConnell , who said allowing
the cuts to expire would equate to a tax increase. “Raising
taxes in the middle of a recession is not a good idea,” said
the Kentucky Republican.  
 President Barack Obama campaigned for election in 2008 on a
promise of extending the Bush tax reductions for families 
earning  up to $250,000 while eliminating the cuts for 
higher-income Americans.  
 Bush tax cuts that passed in 2001 and 2003 gave middle-
income earners a 10 percent rate on couples’ first $14,000 in
income; subsidies for college expenses, a higher child-care
credit and relief from the marriage penalty. Keeping those and
other reductions for the 130 million households earning less
than $250,000 would cost about $300 billion a year, according to
the congressional  Joint Committee on Taxation .  
 Deficit Projection  
 The White House budget office projects the federal deficit
this year will exceed $1.5 trillion, or 10.6 percent of gross
domestic product, and anticipates the deficit in five years will
remain as high as $751 billion, or 3.9 percent of GDP. At the
same time, unemployment  hovers  at 9.5 percent, up from 5.5
percent two years ago.  
 McConnell also said Republicans remain opposed to extending
unemployment benefits unless they can be paid for by budget
cuts.  
 “Somewhere in the course of spending a trillion dollars
we’ve got to be able to find enough to pay for the unemployed,”
McConnell said on CNN. “The question is, when are we going to
get serious about the debt? This administration has been on an
incredible spending streak.”
