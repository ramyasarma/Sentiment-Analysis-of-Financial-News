             Olam International Ltd. , the
Singapore-based commodity trader, plans to offer NZ$109.6
million ($77 million) to take control of NZ Farming Systems
Uruguay Ltd. to add dairy supply for its trading operations.  
 The bid of 55 cents a share for the 81.55 percent of
Christchurch, New Zealand-based NZ Farming that Olam doesn’t own
is priced at 34 percent higher than its previous close, Olam
said in a statement. NZ Farming, which owns dairy farms in
Uruguay,  jumped  29 percent, the most in almost 17 months, to 53
cents at the 5 p.m. local time close in Wellington.  
 Olam, which said last month it has $1 billion to spend on
acquisitions and investments, currently sources dairy products
from Europe, India and North and South America. Uruguay’s dairy
industry may benefit from global prices that are forecast to be
“generally elevated” over the next five years as demand rises
and cost pressures increase, according to Rabobank Groep.  
 “It is a relatively low-cost place to produce milk and if
you can get your business’s supply chain right it should be a
place where you can make money producing for export into the
regional and global market,” Tim Hunt, a global dairy analyst
at Rabobank, said from Melbourne today.  
 Olam has already agreed to buy 28.1 million shares from  PGG
Wrightson Ltd.  to take its stake to 30 percent. NZ Farming
Systems said shareholders should take no action before the
company releases an independent appraisal of the offer.

 The acquisition follows last month’s announcement of Olam’s
purchase of ConAgra Foods Inc.’s dehydrated and vegetable
products business for $250 million.  
 Olam first bought shares in NZ Farming in September to
strengthen its position in dairying. In 2008, it paid about $69
million for a 25 percent stake in New Zealand milk processor
Dairy Trust Ltd.  
 NZ Farming  is converting its beef farms to dairying and had
a $45.9 million loss in the year to June 30, 2009, as milk
prices fell and it wrote down the value of livestock and farms.
The loss narrowed to $7 million in the six months ended Dec. 31
as prices improved, it said in February.  
 The company had total livestock numbers of 54,300,
including 19,600 milking cows as of December 2009, according to
its  website . Area in dairy production totaled 11,100 hectares
(27,429 acres), it said.  
 Uruguay accounted for 1 percent of global exports of dairy
products in 2008, according to Rabobank.
