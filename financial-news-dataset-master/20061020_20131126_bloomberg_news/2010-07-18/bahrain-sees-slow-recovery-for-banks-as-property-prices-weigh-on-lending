             Bahrain’s Economic Development Board
said the recovery of the financial industry, which contributes
about a quarter of the country’s gross domestic product, is
likely to be slow as low property prices weigh on lending.  
 “The EDB expects the finance sector to recover only slowly
from the downturn,” the government’s advisory group said in its
 annual report . “Given the outlook for property, wholesale
banking is unlikely to expand for some time, and Islamic banking
will be more constrained than expected.”  
 Bahrain, the smallest of the six Gulf Cooperation Council
states, halted about $13 billion of projects last year as the
global financial crisis sapped demand for real estate and prices
fell across the Gulf. Economic growth slowed to 3.1 percent in
2009 and public debt rose to 24.2 percent of GDP in the first
quarter, from 17.4 percent in the earlier three months.  
 “Property development will likely remain flat or contract
a little further through 2010, and recover only slowly in 2011
and 2012,” the EDB said.  
 The financial industry contracted by less than 1 percent
overall while wholesale banking declined by 15 percent due to
its dependence on real estate, the EDB said. The Central Bank of
Bahrain took two Bahrain-based wholesale banks under
administration after they defaulted on loans.  
 The EDB forecast economic growth of 4 percent this year,
rising to 7.2 percent by 2015.
