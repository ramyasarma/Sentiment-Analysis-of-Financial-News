             BP Plc , which seeks to sell $10
billion in assets to pay for oil-spill damages in the U.S., will
remain a partner in Azerbaijan’s largest natural-gas field at
Shah Deniz, the country’s energy minister said.  
 “We are not looking at any means of changing BP as our
main partner, or even finding other investors,”  Natig Aliyev 
said in an interview in Batumi, Georgia, today. “The consortium
is already formed, things are going well, and it is not
discussed.”  
 BP, Europe’s second-biggest oil company, has halted
dividend payments to shareholders and is selling assets to pay
for damage from a blowout at its Macondo well that resulted in
the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The company stopped the
flow of oil on July 15, three months after an explosion caused
35,000 to 60,000 barrels of crude to spew daily into the Gulf of
Mexico.  
 BP has already sold $289 million in assets, including U.S.
oil storage tanks and pipelines, to Magellan Midstream Partners
LP. Abu Dhabi, home to one of the world’s largest sovereign
wealth funds, may consider investing in the company, Crown
Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan said last week.  
 BP is the operator of Shah Deniz, which supplies the South
Caucasus Pipeline through Turkey. Its partners in the Caspian
Sea field include  Statoil ASA  and  OAO Lukoil .  
 OAO Gazprom , the world’s biggest producer of natural gas,
would consider buying a stake in Shah Deniz if offered, the
Moscow-based company’s Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller 
said last month. Gas from the second phase of the field’s
development would help feed the planned Nabucco pipeline, which
would extend from Turkey to Europe and avoid Russian territory.  
 Gazprom may buy more gas from Shah Deniz, though there are
no plans to sell stakes in the Azerbaijani field, Aliyev said.  
 “BP will stay,” the minister said. “I wouldn’t want BP to
leave this project.”
