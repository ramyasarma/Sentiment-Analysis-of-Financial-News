             Ruth Madoff , whose husband  Bernard L. Madoff  is serving 150 years for defrauding investors of as
much as $65 billion in a Ponzi scheme, is making amends for his
crime by delivering meals to the homebound in a 1996 Infiniti in
south Florida, the New York Post reported today.  
 Ruth Madoff is living at the $4.5 million Palm Beach
mansion of her brother-in-law  Peter Madoff , according to
neighbors and a postman who delivers her mail there, the
newspaper said. The car she uses for her charity work, which was
purchased in January for a “few thousand,” is registered to
her sister Joan Roman’s address in Boca Raton, Florida, the Post
said, without specifying a source.  
 “She doesn’t own a home, friends and relatives have been
kind enough to give her places to stay,” Ruth Madoff’s lawyer
 Peter Chavkin  said, according to the newspaper.  
 Ruth Madoff now often goes by her maiden name Alpern, the
newspaper said. Bernard Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in
prison on June 29, 2009. Ruth Madoff was left with $2.5 million
in cash under a settlement the family reached with federal
prosecutors. She must keep receipts for personal expenses and
submit monthly reports for all purchases over $100 to a
bankruptcy judge.
