             Frank Timis , executive chairman of
 African Minerals Ltd.,  is working on a plan to move his
exploration company from AIM, the London Stock Exchange’s
international market for smaller companies, to the main exchange
in a deal worth 4 billion pounds ($6.1 billion), the Sunday Times
newspaper reported.  
 Timis said he was close to hiring three new board
directors, auditors, legal firms and an investment bank to pave
the way for listing, the newspaper reported. If the deal doesn’t
go through, Timis said he would list the company in Hong Kong,
according to the report.
