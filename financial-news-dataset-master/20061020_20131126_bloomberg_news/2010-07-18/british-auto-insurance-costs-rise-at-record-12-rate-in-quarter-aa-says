             U.K. car insurance premiums climbed
at least 12 percent in the second quarter, the fastest rate on
record, after rising claim costs and low investment returns
squeezed insurers’ profits, the  Automobile Association Ltd. 
said.  
 Comprehensive car insurance, which includes damage to one’s
own and other drivers’ vehicles, increased 12.1 percent to 980
pounds ($1,507) in the three months to June 30, the AA said
today in a statement. Third party, fire and theft cover,
typically bought by younger drivers, rose 15.8 percent to 1,225
pounds.  
 “Many people who may not have bothered to make a claim for
minor or even non-existent injuries in past accidents are being
encouraged to do so by unscrupulous accident injury claim
lawyers,” Simon Douglas, a director at AA Insurance, said in
the statement.  
 Insurers including  Aviva Plc  and  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc -owned Direct Line, the U.K.’s two largest motor
insurers, are raising prices as record low interest rates have
cut insurers’ investment returns, hurting profits. Car rental
costs and lawsuits have raised the overall cost of claims to 22
percent more than insurers take in premiums, making the industry
unprofitable, according to the AA.  
 “Insurers have been making huge underwriting losses,”
Douglas said. “I won’t be surprised if, by the end of 2010,
we’ll have witnessed an unprecedented 50 percent rise in just
two years.”
