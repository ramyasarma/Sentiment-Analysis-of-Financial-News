             Israel’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in almost three weeks, leading a decline in Middle East
markets, as a drop in U.S. consumer confidence and a slowdown in
China spurred concern the global economic recovery is faltering.  
 Israel’s  TA-25 Index  decreased 1.8 percent, the most since
June 29, to 1,091.03.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,  the
world’s largest maker of generic drugs, slid the most in 16
months after a U.S. court denied its motion to overturn an April
23 jury verdict on the validity of a patent for a heartburn
drug.  Israel Chemicals Ltd. , which extracts minerals from the
Dead Sea to make fertilizer, lost 1.7 percent. In North Africa,
Egypt’s  EGX30 Index  lost the most in almost a week, dropping 1.2
percent.  
 “The local market is down following the big drops overseas
on Friday,” said  Yaron Fridman , equity strategist at Bank
Hapoalim Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Investors are wary of the moves in
the U.S.”  
 U.S. stocks fell last week, ending the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average ’s longest winning streak in two months after retail
sales dropped and consumer confidence tumbled in July to the
lowest level in a year. On July 14, the Commerce Department said
sales at retailers fell 0.5 percent in June. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment fell to 66.5, the lowest since August and less than
the most pessimistic forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 China’s economic expansion eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter and industrial production cooled more than
forecast in June. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  lost 0.9
percent on July 16. Crude oil for August delivery slipped 61
cents to settle at $76.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on July 16.  
 Teva Drops  
 Teva lost 2.9 percent, the most since March 2009, to 207.1
shekels. The company said on July 16 the U.S. District Court for
the District of New Jersey denied its motion to overturn an
April 23 jury verdict on the validity of a patent for the
heartburn drug Protonix held by Pfizer Inc.’s Wyeth unit. Teva
said it isn’t prohibited from selling the generic version of the
drug prior to January 2011 when the pediatric exclusivity
expires.  
 Israel Chemicals retreated the most since July 7 to 45
shekels.  
 Qatar’s index fell 0.7 percent and Dubai’s  DFM General
Index  slipped 0.8 percent. Kuwait’s market and Saudi Arabia’s
 Tadawul All Share Index  retreated 0.3 percent. Bahrain’s  gauge 
advanced 0.5 percent and Oman’s benchmark stock  index  gained
less than 0.1 percent.  
 Aabar Investments PJSC  advanced after it raised its offer
and agreed to pay investors 1.95 dirhams a share as the company
seeks to delist from the Abu Dhabi bourse. The shares rose 8.3
percent, the most since Dec. 14, to 1.57 dirhams.  
 Investors in the region are “cued in to the macroeconomic
situation,” said  Akram Annous , deputy fund manager at Al Mal
Capital PSC in Dubai. “From a market integrity standpoint, the
news on Aabar is very positive.”  
 Israel’s 10-year Mimshal Shiklit maturing in January 2020
rose 0.46 shekel to 105.26, pushing the yield on the 5 percent
notes down five basis points to 4.61 percent. The shekel rose
0.1 percent to 3.8610 per dollar on July 16.
