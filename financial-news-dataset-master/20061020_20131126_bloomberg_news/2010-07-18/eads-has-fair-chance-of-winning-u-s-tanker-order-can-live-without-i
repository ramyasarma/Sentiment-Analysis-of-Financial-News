             European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.  Chief Executive Officer  Louis Gallois  said he is confident
of winning a $35 billion U.S. Air Force refuelling-tanker order
pitting his company against a rival bid from Boeing Co.  
 “I think we have a chance, a fair chance to win,” Gallois
said at a press meeting in London yesterday. “The tanker is an
important strategic move for us, but we have to be prepared to
live without it. And we are prepared to live without it.”  
 EADS subsidiary Airbus SAS, whose A330-200 plane will serve
as platform for the tanker, submitted its proposal to the Air
Force on July 8, and the Pentagon will likely announce in
November if Boeing or EADS has won the order for 179 airplanes
to replace 1950s-era tankers. EADS’s bid has met political
opposition in the U.S., as some lawmaker favour the U.S. entry.  
 The European company had previously teamed up with  Northrop
Grumman Corp.  on the bid, before the U.S. defense contractor
dropped out and EADS decided to go it alone. EADS has won orders
for its tanker from countries including Australia, a track
record the company said increases its chances for the U.S. bid.
One prerequisite is to make money with the order, Gallois said.  
 “We are not going into the tanker deal with the idea not
to make money,” the CEO said. “We would prefer to lose than
not to make money.”  
 ‘Solid Bid’  
 Boeing’s bid based on its 767 airplane is competitive
without losing money,  Dennis Muilenburg , the chief of its
defense unit, said today in London.  
 “We’ve put a solid bid on the table” in terms of price,
Muilenburg said at a news conference. “But we also have a
responsibility to our shareholders.” The company’s bid strikes
a balance between both obligations, he said.  
 If successful with its bid, EADS plans to set up an
 assembly plant  in Mobile, Alabama, to build the tankers as well
as A330-based freighter aircraft. Moving more business into the
U.S. would help EADS lessen the impact from currency swings and
improve access to the world’s largest defense market.  
 EADS has won a total of 28 A330 tankers orders from four
customers, including Australia, the U.K., Saudi Arabia, and the
United Arab Emirates. Boeing has sold tankers based on its 767
model to Japan and Italy.
