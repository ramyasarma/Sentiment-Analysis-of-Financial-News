             U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will tomorrow set out plans to take “hundreds of millions of
pounds” from dormant bank accounts to fund social projects.  
 In a speech, Cameron will say he is pressing ahead with
plans to set up a “Big Society Bank” to finance his plan to
have charitable groups and not-for-profit companies do jobs
currently done by the government.  
 “These unclaimed assets, alongside the private sector
investment that we will leverage, will mean that the Big Society
Bank will make available hundreds of millions of pounds of new
finance to some of our most dynamic social organizations,”
Cameron will say, according to extracts released by his office.  
 The new U.K. coalition government elected in May is
maintaining pressure on the financial services industry
following the bailout of  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc  and  Lloyds
Banking Group  by the previous leadership.
