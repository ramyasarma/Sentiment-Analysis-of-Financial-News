              Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s
largest gold producer, said that it is required to close a
copper plant in Shanghang, Fujian province, after a
“substantial leakage of waste water” was discovered by a
government team of investigators.  
 A plant manager, deputy plant manager and environmental
safety officer of the Zijinshan Copper Mine plant were detained
by police, the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today. Duties of the deputy plant manager and
environmental safety officer were suspended, the statement said.  
 An investigation team, made up of Ministry of Environmental
Protection and local government officials, found the discharge
resulted from an illegally installed pipe allowing waste to
enter the river directly. Zijin has been ordered to repair the
problem and “enhance” leak prevention measures, the statement
said.  
 The company had planned to produce 13,000 tons of copper at
the plant this year, the statement said. The company’s total
copper production target for 2010 is 100,000 tons, it said.
