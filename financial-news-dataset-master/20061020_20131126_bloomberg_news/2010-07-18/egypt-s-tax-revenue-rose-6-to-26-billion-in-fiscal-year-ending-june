             Egypt’s tax revenue for the fiscal
year through June rose to 148 billion Egyptian pounds ($26
billion), a 6 percent increase on the previous year, Finance
Minister  Youssef Boutros-Ghali  said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Income tax revenue reached 92.4 billion Egyptian pounds,
compared with 89.5 billion pounds the previous year, while sales
tax revenue stood at 55.7 billion pounds, Boutros-Ghali said.  
 The budget deficit has remained stable for the past three
years at less than 8.3 percent of gross domestic product, the
minister said today in the statement. The International Monetary
Fund in February said Egypt’s plans to reduce its deficit to
about 3 percent of GDP by the 2014-2015 fiscal year were
feasible.
