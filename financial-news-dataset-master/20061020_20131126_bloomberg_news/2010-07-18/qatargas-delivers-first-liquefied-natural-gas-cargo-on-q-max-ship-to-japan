             Qatar Liquefied Gas Co., the fuel
producer and exporter known as QatarGas, delivered its first
cargo on a Q-Max vessel to Japan.  
 The liquefied natural-gas tanker Mozah is one of the Q-Max
class of ships, the largest such vessel in the world, capable of
transporting 266,000 cubic meters of fuel, the company said in
an e-mailed statement today. The vessel delivered the LNG, gas
cooled to a liquid for transport by ship, to  Chubu Electric
Power Co.’s  Chita Terminal.  
 QatarGas will have chartered 14 Q-Max vessels under long-
term contracts by the end of this year, according to the  website 
of the vessels’ owner, Qatar Gas Transport Co. Built to deliver
LNG to new receiving terminals in the U.S. and the U.K., Qatar
has sought new ports for Q-Max tankers amid forecasts for
reduced LNG demand in North America, where domestic gas
production is increasing.  
 Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of LNG, plans to raise
its annual capacity to make the fuel to 77 million tons by the
end of 2010 with the start of three of the world’s largest LNG
production plants this year.  
 QatarGas is a venture between Qatar Petroleum and oil
companies including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA
and ConocoPhillips.
