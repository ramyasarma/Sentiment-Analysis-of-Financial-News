             Rainstorms left at least 13
people dead in southwest China’s Sichuan Province, with 23
missing late yesterday, and 300 more were trapped by
floodwaters today in Chongqing municipality.  
 The victims were killed by mountain torrents, landslides
and house collapses triggered by the rain, which had forced
the Shuangliu International Airport in Chengdu, the
provincial capital, to close on July 16, state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported.  
 Across south China at least 146 people have been
confirmed dead and 40 are missing amid the rainstorms and
flooding that began on July 3, Xinhua said, citing the Civil
Affairs Ministry. The rain slowed in parts of Sichuan and
stopped in Chengdu yesterday, the agency reported, allowing
landings and takeoffs to resume in the airport.  
 No casualties were reported in nearby Chongqing, Xinhua
said, but many people remained trapped early today as 12,300
others were evacuated.  
 China Three Gorges Corp., which operates the Three
Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, expected the floods to reach
a peak flow of 65,000 cubic meters per second in two or three
days from yesterday, Xinhua said, which would be the most
since its construction.  
 The company said yesterday that it would close the ship
locks if the floods were to reach 45,000 cubic meters per
second.
