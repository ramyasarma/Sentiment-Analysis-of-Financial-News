             China intensified flood-control
measures as rainstorms raised water levels in the Yangtze River
and killed at least 18 people in southwest Sichuan Province.  
 The Ministry of Water Resources dispatched urgent notices
and flood control officials to cities along the river as heavy
rains persisted, it said in a  statement  on its website today.
The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River was expected
experience flooding, with a peak flow of 66,000 cubic meters per
second, it said.  
 The storms left 18 dead and another 18 were missing, an
official at the province’s flood control and drought relief
office said today, declining to be identified.  
 Across south China at least 146 people have been confirmed
dead and 40 are missing amid the rainstorms and flooding that
began on July 3, Xinhua said, citing the Civil Affairs Ministry.
The rain slowed in parts of Sichuan and stopped in Chengdu
yesterday, the agency reported, allowing landings and takeoffs
to resume in the airport.  
 The victims in Sichuan were killed by mountain torrents,
landslides and house collapses triggered by the rain, which had
forced the Shuangliu International Airport in Chengdu, the
provincial capital, to close on July 16, state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported today.  
 No casualties were reported in nearby Chongqing, Xinhua
said, but many people remained trapped early today as 12,300
others were evacuated.
