             China’s  export growth  may slow over
the rest of the year to less than half the pace of the first six
months, a government agency forecast.  
 The gain for July-through-December may be 16.3 percent from
a year earlier, the China Securities Journal  said  today, citing
a report by the State Information Center. That would be down
from 35 percent in the first half, customs bureau data show.  
 Weaker export growth may exacerbate a second-half slowdown
in the expansion of the world’s third-biggest economy,
encouraging the government to limit gains by the yuan against
the dollar. China last month indicated that it was ending a two-
year peg to the U.S. currency.  
 “The main concern surrounding China’s export outlook is
the sustainability of the global recovery,”  Alaistair Chan , a
Sydney-based economist at Moody’s Economy.com, said in a report
today. “Exports are likely to face strong headwinds in coming
months.”  
 The State Information Center, a research body under the
National Development and Reform Commission, said export growth
may slow each quarter. It cited the removal of tax rebates,
weaker demand because of Europe’s debt crisis, and comparisons
with higher base levels.  
 Trade Advantage  
 The U.S. called last month for the Chinese currency to
gain “significantly,” seeing an undervalued yuan as giving the
Asian nation an unfair advantage in global trade.  
 The yuan declined the most in two weeks today, dropping
0.07 percent to 6.7798 per dollar as of 12:15 p.m. in Shanghai.  
 For the full year, overseas shipments may climb 24.5
percent, the report said. That would compare with a 16 percent
decline in 2009.  
 Imports may gain 19.3 percent in the second half, the
newspaper said, citing stabilizing commodity prices and slowing
investment demand. That would compare with a gain of more than
50 percent in the first half.  
 China’s gross domestic product expanded 10.3 percent in the
second quarter, down from 11.9 percent in the first, the
government reported last week. Exports were a record $137
billion in June.  
 The economy is cooling after the government tempered credit
growth and investment spending and cracked down on real-estate
speculation.
