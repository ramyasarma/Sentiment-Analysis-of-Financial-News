             Peru’s central bank is matching a
regional trend by raising benchmark interest rates, said  Jorge Estrella , the central bank’s head of monetary policy.  
 The country’s central bank late yesterday raised its
benchmark lending rate by a half-point to 2.5 percent, more than
economists forecast, to prevent inflationary pressures arising
from the “spectacular” economic growth forecast by bank chief
 Julio Velarde . Central bankers in Brazil and Chile have raised
lending rates so far in 2010.  
 Increased private investment and public spending have
helped push South America’s sixth-biggest economy to its fastest
growth since 2008. Peru’s  economy expanded  9.2 percent in May
from a year earlier and 10 percent in June, Velarde told
reporters July 22.  
 “The Finance Ministry will have to put the brakes on
spending so the economy grows in a sustained way,” Estrella
said on a conference call with reporters today. “The rate
increase was preventative, as we don’t foresee inflationary
pressures.”  
 Peru’s inflation will be within the 1 percent to 3 percent
target range this year, Estrella said.  Consumer  prices rose 1.8
percent in the year to date through July, according to the
National Statistics Institute.  
 The sol was little changed at 2.8015 per dollar at 2:29
p.m. New York time after the central bank purchased $167 million
in the foreign exchange market today. The bank bought $718.5
million this week to reduce volatility in the exchange rate.
