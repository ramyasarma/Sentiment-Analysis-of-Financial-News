             State watchdogs have assigned a group
of regulators to review life insurers’ practice of retaining
death benefits and investing the funds to build company profits.  
 The group will hold its first meeting Aug. 15 in Seattle,
according to a statement today from the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners. New Hampshire’s  Roger Sevigny , the
past-president of the NAIC, will lead the group with
Connecticut’s  Thomas Sullivan .  
 U.S. life insurers , a group led by  MetLife Inc. , have drawn
fire from state and national elected officials since Bloomberg
Markets reported that more than 100 carriers profit by holding
and investing $28 billion owed to life insurance beneficiaries.
NAIC President-Elect  Susan Voss  said in an interview this week
that oversight must be improved.  
 “We want consumers to have as many choices as possible in
how they receive their claims payments,”  Jane Cline , president
of the NAIC said in the statement. “We also want to make
certain the terms of those payments are fully disclosed in
language that is clear and easy to understand.”  
 MetLife and  Prudential Financial Inc. , the No. 2 U.S. life
insurer, settle death claims by issuing IOUs. Beneficiaries are
told they hold interest-bearing “retained-asset accounts,”
while insurers hold the funds and accrue investment income.
