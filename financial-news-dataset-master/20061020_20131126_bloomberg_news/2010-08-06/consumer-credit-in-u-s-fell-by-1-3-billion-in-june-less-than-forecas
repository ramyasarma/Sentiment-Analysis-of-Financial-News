             Consumer credit  in the U.S. declined
in June for a fifth straight month, a sign an uneven labor
market is discouraging borrowing.  
 The $1.3 billion decrease in credit followed a revised $5.3
billion drop in May, the Federal Reserve said today in
Washington. Economists projected a $5.3 billion decline in the
measure of credit-card debt and non-revolving loans for June,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Credit-card debt that dropped in June to the lowest level
since October 2005 indicates consumer purchases, which account
for about 70 percent of the economy, will be restrained as
Americans rebuild savings. An increase in confidence to borrow
and spend more depends on job gains after companies added fewer
workers than forecast in July.  
 “The consumer has some tough sledding ahead,” said  Joshua Shapiro , chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. in New York. “Without
any job growth, it’s going to be difficult to generate the kind
of income growth we need to generate consumer spending growth.”  
 Projections in the Bloomberg survey of 36 economists for
June consumer credit ranged from declines of $2 billion to $11
billion after a previously reported $9.1 billion decrease a
month earlier.  
 Stocks held losses after the report, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index dropping 0.6 percent to 1,118.7 at 3:32 p.m. in
New York. The 10-year Treasury note rose, pushing down the yield
to 2.82 percent from 2.9 percent late yesterday.  
 July Employment  
 A 71,000 gain in private employment in July followed a
31,000 increase in June that was smaller than initially,
according to figures released today by the Labor Department.
Economists had forecast a 90,000 gain, according to the
Bloomberg survey median. Including government jobs, payrolls
fell 131,000 last month due to a drop in federal census workers
as the population count wound down.  
 The  unemployment rate  held at 9.5 percent in July, as the
size of the labor force declined.  
 Today’s Fed report showed  revolving debt , which includes
credit cards, declined $4.5 billion in June to $826.5 billion,
the lowest level since 2005.  
 Non-revolving debt , including loans for cars and mobile
homes, rose $3.1 billion for the month. The report doesn’t track
debt secured by real estate.  
 Auto sales  in the U.S. cooled in June to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 11.08 million from an 11.64 million pace
a month earlier, according to industry statistics. Sales picked
up in July to an 11.56 million rate.  
 Second Quarter  
 Consumer spending during the second quarter rose at a 1.6
percent annual rate, slower than the 1.9 percent in the first
three months of the year, Commerce Department figures showed on
July 30. The economy also slowed last quarter, growing 2.4
percent after expanding at a 3.7 percent pace from January
through March.  
 “The economic environment remains uneven” and “card
members are borrowing less and paying down more of their
outstanding debt,”  Kenneth I. Chenault , chairman and chief
executive officer of  American Express Co. , the biggest U.S.
credit card issuer by purchases, said in a statement released on
July 22.  
 Retailers in July reported sales gains that missed
analysts’ estimates. Sales at 30 chains climbed 3 percent, less
than the 3.2 percent average of analyst projections, Retail
Metrics Inc. said yesterday. It marked the fourth straight month
that sales have trailed estimates, according to the researcher.
