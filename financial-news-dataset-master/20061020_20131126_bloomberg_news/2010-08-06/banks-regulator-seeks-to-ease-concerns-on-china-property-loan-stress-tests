             China’s  banking regulator  said
scenarios lenders are required to use in stress tests don’t
represent its outlook on the nation’s property market, seeking
to ease concerns that it expects steeper declines in home prices.  
 The suggested risk factors aren’t meant to signal likely
changes in real-estate lending policies, according to a
 statement  on the China Banking Regulatory Commission’s website
yesterday. Lenders will be instructed to “resolutely” curb
speculation and “strictly” manage mortgage loans, it said.  
 Property stocks slumped in Shanghai yesterday after a
person familiar with the matter said the regulator told banks to
conduct stress tests that assume housing prices may drop as much
as 60 percent in worst-case scenarios in some cities. The CBRC
in May had ordered tests assuming declines of as much as 30
percent to gauge the impact on real-estate loans.  
 “It’s a sign of a prudent stance by the regulators,”
 Jianguang Shen , a Hong Kong-based economist at Mizuho Securities
Asia Ltd., told Bloomberg TV in Beijing today, referring to the
new tests. “I don’t think this is a sign that the government is
going to tighten further the housing-market policy.”  
 An  index  tracking 34 developers listed in Shanghai
yesterday fell the most since July 13.  
 The government escalated a crackdown on speculative
investments in property in mid-April by raising minimum down-
payments and mortgage rates on loans for second homes after
prices rose to  record highs . Lenders can suspend loans to third-
home buyers in regions with rapid price gains or raise the
required down-payment and borrowing costs “by a large margin,”
the CBRC reiterated in yesterday’s statement.
