             Pioneer Foods Ltd. expects product
costs to rise “in the months ahead” as a result of higher
electricity and payroll costs, and due to the Russian ban on
grain exports.  
 “We’ll absorb these increases for as long as possible,”
Chief Executive Officer Andre Hanekom said in an e-mailed
response to questions today.
