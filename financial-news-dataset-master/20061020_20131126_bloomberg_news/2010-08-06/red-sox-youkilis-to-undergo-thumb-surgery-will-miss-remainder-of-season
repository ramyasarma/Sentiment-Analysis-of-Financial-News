             Boston Red Sox first baseman  Kevin Youkilis  will undergo thumb surgery today and miss the rest of
the Major League Baseball season.  
 Youkilis will have a torn adductor muscle repaired at the
Cleveland Clinic, according to the team’s website. He was hurt
swinging the bat in a game four days ago.  
 “We pretty much had an idea this was a pretty good
possibility,” Red Sox manager  Terry Francona  said on the
website. “As much as we love having Youk on the field, I would
have had a much harder time sending him out there knowing that
he might really hurt himself.”  
 Youkilis, 31, is batting .307 with 19 homers, 62 runs
batted in and a team-leading 77 runs scored this season. He’s
the 15th Red Sox player to spend time on the disabled list in
2010.  
 Boston is third in the American League Eastern Division,
six games behind the New York Yankees. The teams open a four-
game series tonight at Yankee Stadium.
