             Canada’s dollar fell and was poised
to erase the week’s gains as government bonds rose after reports
showed unexpected July job cuts in the U.S. and Canada, reducing
expectations for higher interest rates.  
 “These numbers definitely took the steam out of the
loonie,”  Blake Jespersen , director of foreign exchange at Bank
of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto. “We’ll have to see if
risk appetite comes back.”  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, declined 1.3
percent, the most in three weeks, to C$1.0301 per U.S. dollar at
2:03 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0168 yesterday, when it touched
C$1.0108, the strongest since May 4 and C$1.0297 July 30. One
Canadian dollar purchases 97.08 U.S. cents.  
 The government two-year note’s  yield  fell 9 basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 1.43 percent. The price of the 2
percent security maturing in September 2012 rose 18 cents to
C$101.15.  
 Employers in Canada cut 9,300 jobs in July after a 93,200-
position increase in June, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. The median forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for 12,500 more jobs. The unemployment rate increased
to 8 percent from 7.9 percent.  
 Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said there is no
“indication” the country needs a second stimulus package amid
signs the recovery is slowing, adding he is “monitoring” the
situation.  
 ‘Recovery Remains Fragile’  
 “The job numbers today indicate what we have been saying;
the global recovery remains fragile,” Harper said. “It’s not
going to be all smooth sailing. The trend lines have generally
been good.”  
 Separately, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today the
government will cut the country’s debt-to-output ratio with a
“clear-cut” exit strategy to return the budget to balance.  
 Non-farm U.S. payrolls fell 131,000 in July after a revised
reduction of 221,000 in the previous month, the Labor Department
reported today. The median forecast of 84 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a reduction of 65,000. The
unemployment rate stayed at 9.5 percent.  
 Private U.S. payrolls that exclude government agencies rose
by 71,000 after a June gain of 31,000 that was smaller than
previously reported. Economists projected a 90,000 July
increase.  
 Short-Term Weakness  
 “Given what’s going on in the U.S., it’s not necessarily
the best scenario for the two economies, which had the highest
growth forecasts for the next year,”  David Watt , senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s
biggest bank, said by phone from Toronto. “Short-term, we’re
likely going to see the Canadian dollar overall underperform,
but modestly.”  
 RBC predicts the Canadian dollar will weaken to C$1.09
versus the  greenback  by the end of September, before rebounding
to parity by the middle of 2011. Watt said the disappointing
jobs data lends credence to his theory that the central bank
will pause this year in its cycle of interest-rate increases.  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  became the first Group
of Seven central banker since July 2008 to lift borrowing costs,
increasing the target lending rate by a quarter-percentage point
to 0.5 percent on June 1. He raised the benchmark again on July
20 to 0.75 percent. The next meetings are Sept. 8, Oct. 19 and
Dec. 7.  
 Political View  
 Prime Minister Harper said the Bank of Canada’s recent
steps to reduce stimulus in the economy are a “strong”
indication the government’s focus should be on reducing the
deficit.  
 The U.S. Federal Reserve meets next week to determine
interest-rate policy. Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross , who today called the Canadian jobs report a “real
stinker” and said commodity-based economies like Canada’s
aren’t doing as well as expected, expects Fed rates to remain
low for two to three years.  
 The Canadian currency reached 99.31 Canadian cents per U.S.
dollar on April 21, the highest in 22 months, as traders bet on
the interest-rate increases.  
 The Canadian dollar “could go back to C$1.03 or C$1.0350
first, but in the coming months I think it will be a slow grind
towards parity,” Jespersen said.  
 Canada’s government bonds have made investors 4.7 percent
this year, according to a Merrill Lynch & Co. index.
