             The dollar dropped to an eight-month
low against the yen and fell versus the euro as data showed the
U.S. lost more jobs in July than forecast, adding to concern the
economy may need additional stimulus.  
 “The initial reaction is to sell risk,” said  Andrew Busch , a global currency strategist at Bank of Montreal in
Chicago. The Federal Reserve “is going to be under a lot of
pressure to take additional measures,” he said.  
 The  Dollar Index  declined for the ninth straight week, the
longest losing streak since 2004. The U.S. currency will
strengthen as the global economy slips back into recession,
according to  John Taylor , chairman of FX Concepts LLC, manager
of the world’s largest currency hedge fund. Fed policy makers
are scheduled to meet next week.  
 The dollar depreciated 0.4 percent to 85.49 yen at 4:49
p.m. in New York, from 85.82 yesterday, and reached 85.02 yen.
That’s the lowest since Nov. 27, when it touched levels last
seen in 1995.  
 The greenback fell 0.7 percent to $1.3283 per euro after
touching $1.3334, the weakest since May 3. The dollar lost for a
second week versus both the yen and euro, falling 1.1 percent
and 1.7 percent, respectively. The shared currency rose 0.3
percent today to 113.56 yen.  
 Nonfarm payrolls lost 131,000 positions last month, Labor
Department data showed today, compared with a drop of 65,000
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 84 economists. The
economy shed a revised 221,000 jobs in June. Private payrolls
that exclude government agencies rose by 71,000, less than
forecast, after a gain of 31,000 in June that was smaller than
first reported. The jobless rate held steady at 9.5 percent.  
 Concerns ‘Reignited’  
 “When we have data like today, the concerns about global
growth get reignited,” said  Jens Nordvig , a managing director
of currency research in New York at Nomura Holdings Inc.
“That’s the dynamic you have now.”  
 Mexico’s peso and Canada’s dollar were the worst performers
among major currencies after the payrolls data. Each country has
the U.S. as its biggest trading partner. Canada’s economy also
unexpectedly shed jobs last month, with the government
statistics agency reporting a net loss of 9,300 positions.  
 The Canadian currency tumbled 1 percent to C$1.0268 to the
greenback, while the peso dropped 1 percent to 12.6892 to the
dollar.  
 The  difference  between short-term lending rates in the U.S.
and Europe widened, which may damp demand for U.S. assets and
the dollar. The rate that London-based banks say they charge
each other for three-month loans in dollars fell for the 18th
straight day, while the rate for euro loans rose.  
 Rate Gap  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollars
declined to 0.411 percent today, the lowest level since May 6,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. The rate was
0.418 percent yesterday. Libor for  euros  for three months rose
to 0.834 percent today, the highest in a year, from 0.832
percent yesterday, the BBA said.  
 The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six trading
partners, fell 0.6 percent to 80.367 and touched 80.085, the
lowest level since April 14. The measure also declined on July
2, when the government reported a loss of jobs, while it rose on
June 4, when data showed a gain in May of 431,000 positions.  
 The index slid 1.4 percent for the past five days for a
ninth weekly  loss , the most since December 2004.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled as much as 1.7
percent before paring losses to a 0.4 percent drop at closing.  
 Global Slump  
 The dollar will revive as the global economy slumps again,
which could be in “another couple of weeks,” FX Concepts’ Taylor
said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Because most
international debt is dollar-denominated, when economic
conditions weaken and U.S. banks cut back on lending, global
banks scramble for the greenback and boost its value, he said.  
 Labor Department data yesterday showed the number of
Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits last
week unexpectedly increased by 19,000, to 479,000, fueling
speculation the Fed will discuss stimulus measures next week.  
 “This chronically worse jobs data coming out is likely to
continue to give the U.S. Fed scope to keep rates near zero for
an extended period of time -- that’s why the dollar sold off so
rapidly,” said  John Doyle , a strategist in Washington at
currency-trading firm Tempus Consulting Inc.  
 Rate Bets  
 Traders cut bets the Fed will raise its target rate for
overnight lending between banks by at least a quarter-percentage
point by the August 2011 meeting. Futures on the CME Group Inc.
exchange showed a 28 percent chance policy makers will raise the
rate by then, compared with a 49 percent probability a week ago.  
 The central bank, which meets Aug. 10, has kept the
benchmark rate at a record low range of zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008. It also used purchases of Treasury,
housing-agency and mortgage-backed securities to spur growth in
an effort that ended in March. The buys increased the size of
its balance sheet to a record $2.35 trillion in May from $900
billion two years earlier.  
 St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  wrote in a paper
published last week the central bank should resume purchases of
Treasuries if the economy slows and prices fall.
