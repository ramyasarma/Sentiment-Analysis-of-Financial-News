             Holders of commercial-mortgage backed
securities have had $1.1 billion in interest withheld as
plunging property values lead to reappraisals that eat into
bondholders’ payments, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The largest deficit is $57.8 million on a bond backed by a
loan to finance properties owned by Extended Stay Inc., the
hotel chain whose plan to exit bankruptcy was approved by a
judge last month. The second largest is a $23.4 million
shortfall on a $7.5 billion issue, commonly cited as a market
barometer, sold by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc in June 2007, Bloomberg data show.  
 U.S. commercial property prices are down 39 percent from
2007 peaks, according to Moody’s Investors Service, leading to
lower valuations for owners struggling to make debt payments.
When a borrower becomes delinquent, the property may be
reappraised to determine its current value. For those properties
worth less than the mortgage, the servicer stops payments beyond
likely recoveries in the event of foreclosure, causing interest
payments to junior bondholders to fall short.  
 “Interest shortfalls are a symptom of rising delinquencies
and the collateral problems that have been building over the
past 18 months,” said  Richard Parkus , an analyst at Morgan
Stanley in New York. “This is going to be a primary focus going
forward.”  
 At least $10 million of interest shortfalls have
accumulated on 15 bonds, Bloomberg data show.

                          Aug. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Commercial property deals have increased in the first half of 2010 as investors look to take advantage of lower prices for office, apartment buildings and hotels. U.S. commercial property prices are down 39 percent from 2007 peaks, according to Moody’s Investors Service, creating a potential investment opportunity in major markets such as New York and San Francisco, Bloomberg's Monica Bertran reports.
