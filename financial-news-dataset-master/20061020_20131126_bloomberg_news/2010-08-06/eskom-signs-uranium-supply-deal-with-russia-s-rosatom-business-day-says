             Eskom Holdings Ltd., South Africa’s
state-owned power utility, signed a long-term supply contract
with Tenex, a unit of Russia’s nuclear company Rosatom Corp.,
for uranium, Business Day reported, citing Rosatom’s Director
General  Sergei Kiriyenko .  
 The agreement will provide South Africa’s only nuclear
plant, Koeberg, with uranium supplies for 10 years, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The transaction would give
Russia control of about 45 percent of South Africa’s uranium
market, it said.
