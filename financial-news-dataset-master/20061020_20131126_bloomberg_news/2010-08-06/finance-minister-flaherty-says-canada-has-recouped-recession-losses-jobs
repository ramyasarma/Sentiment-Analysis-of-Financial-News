             Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  today said his government will cut the country’s net-
debt ratio with a “clear-cut” exit strategy to return the
budget back to balance.  
 The country will end its temporary stimulus in March,
implement targeted measures to limit program spending and review
government administration and overhead costs to identify
possible savings, Flaherty said in a speech in Orillia, Ontario.  
 “This three-point plan will place our net-debt ratio on a
clear downward track when the debt burdens of other nations are
expected to escalate even higher,” he said.  
 Canada’s growth of 3.5 percent this year will lead the
U.S., the euro zone and Japan on consumer and government
spending, the Bank of Canada said July 22. The annual  growth
rate  probably slowed to 3 percent in the second quarter from a
decade-high pace of 6.1 percent in the January-March period,
when low mortgage rates and temporary tax credits sparked
spending, the bank said.  
 Flaherty also said his country has recovered the economic
losses from last year’s recession.  
 “Canada has virtually recouped a recession’s worth of
economic decline and, with more than 400,000 jobs created since
July 2009, virtually all of the jobs lost during the downturn,”
Flaherty said.  
 Employment  fell by 9,300 jobs in July, the first decline
this year, following a 93,200 increase in June, Statistics
Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predicted 12,500 new jobs, according to the median of 22
estimates.  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, declined as
much as 0.9 percent, the most in three weeks, and was down 0.8
percent to C$1.0253 per U.S. dollar at 10:40 a.m. in Toronto,
from C$1.0168 yesterday, when it touched C$1.0108, the strongest
since May 4. One Canadian dollar purchases 97.53 U.S. cents.  
 Flaherty also said the government’s stimulus plan added
almost 2 percentage points on average to growth in the last
three quarters of 2009.
