             New York Attorney General  Andrew M. Cuomo  is seeking to recover damages from  Samsung Electronics Co.  
and other manufacturers accused of colluding to fix prices of
the liquid-crystal displays used in televisions, computers and
mobile phones.  
 An antitrust suit he filed today in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan seeks damages from 1996 to 2006 for the state, for
local governments and for other public entities that bought
goods containing the screens, Cuomo said in a statement. The
filing couldn’t immediately be confirmed with the court clerk.  
 Companies including AU Optronics Corp., Toshiba Corp. and
Hitachi Ltd., and their U.S. counterparts, worked together for a
decade to avoid price competition in the $70 billion LCD market,
Cuomo said. They met secretly to set prices, shared production
information and agreed to output levels, he said. Some have
already pleaded guilty to U.S. antitrust charges, according to
the complaint.  
 “An illegal cartel eliminated competition in the
marketplace for LCD screens, made its own secret decisions to
boost prices and then took steps to make those high prices
stick,” Cuomo said in the statement.  Richard Bamberger , a
spokesman for Cuomo, said damages are in the tens of millions of
dollars.  
 Many of the companies and their executives pleaded guilty
to federal criminal antitrust violations and paid more than
$890 million in fines, the complaint said. They include Hitachi
Displays Ltd., LG Display Co. and its subsidiary LG Display
America Inc., and Sharp Corp., the suit said.  
 Chris Goodhart , a spokeswoman for Samsung, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment. A representative of
LG Display couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. An e-
mail to the AU Optronics publicity office wasn’t immediately
returned. A Toshiba spokesman said the company is studying the
complaint. Sharp and Hitachi didn’t immediately return messages
seeking comment.  
 A message sent to the public relations department of Chimei
Innolux, which owns defendant Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp.,
wasn’t immediately responded to. A representative of Chi Mei
Optoelectronics USA in San Jose, California, referred questions
to Taiwan.
