             Blockbuster Inc.  will probably
receive a one-month reprieve from creditors next week so the
video-rental chain can prepare for a possible bankruptcy filing
in September, three people with knowledge of the matter said.  
 Lenders  are pushing for a pre-packaged bankruptcy in
exchange for the 30-day extension on debt repayment, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
are private. Blockbuster is reaching out to companies about
buying  assets  in or out of bankruptcy, one of the people said.  
 “We’ve been transparent throughout this process about the
potential sales or licensing of certain international operating
assets,” Patricia Sullivan, a Blockbuster spokeswoman, said in
an e-mailed statement. “These discussions are ongoing.”  
 The company continues to engage in “productive talks”
with lenders, Sullivan said.  
 Blockbuster’s only option may be filing for a Chapter 11
restructuring, said  Michael Pachter , an analyst with Los
Angeles-based Wedbush Securities Inc. who rates the stock
“neutral.”  
 “The debt is killing them,” Pachter said today in a
telephone interview. “They have to wipe the slate clean and get
out from under $100 million or more of interest payments.”  
 The company’s main asset is its inventory of DVDs and the
name, which Pachter valued at “tens of millions of dollars.”  
 NCR Corp. is licensing the Blockbuster moniker for use in
video vending machines it’s installing throughout the U.S. The
company, based in Duluth, Georgia, has more than 6,500 kiosks,
primarily under the Blockbuster Express brand, according to a
news release last month.  
 Losing to Competitors  
 Bondholders agreed last month to let Dallas-based
Blockbuster defer the interest and principal on senior secured
notes until Aug. 13. The company has lost about $1 billion
during the past three years on competition from  Netflix Inc. ’s
subscription service and Coinstar Inc.’s Redbox DVD machines.  
 Blockbuster fell 2 cents, or 9.1 percent, to 17 cents at
3:59 p.m. New York time in over-the-counter  trading . The shares
have dropped 75 percent this year. The company’s $630 million of
11.75 percent  notes  due in 2014 last traded July 28 at 66.5
cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  
 Blockbuster’s secured bondholders hired Houlihan Lokey
Howard & Zukin in March to advise them on the video retailer,
people with knowledge of the move said at the time. Blockbuster
is being advised by Rothschild and Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP.
