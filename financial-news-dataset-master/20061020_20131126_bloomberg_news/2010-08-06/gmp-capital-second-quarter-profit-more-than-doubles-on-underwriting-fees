             GMP Capital Inc. , the second-worst
performing financial-services stock in Canada this year, said
second-quarter profit more than doubled on record underwriting
fees.  
 Net income climbed to C$22.5 million ($22 million), or 32
cents a basic share, from C$8.1 million, or 12 cents, a year
earlier, Canada’s second-largest non-bank brokerage said today
in a statement. The Toronto-based firm raised its quarterly
dividend to 6 cents a share from 5 cents.  
 Investment-banking revenue jumped 42 percent to C$75.9
million on record underwriting fees and higher revenue from
mergers and other advisory services, the brokerage said.  
 GMP’s profit was boosted from a year ago when the company
recorded provisions related to its conversion from an income
trust.  
 The company was expected to earn 21 cents a diluted share,
based on the average  estimate  of two analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  
 GMP rose 19 cents, or 2 percent, to C$9.54 in 9:52 a.m.
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have dropped
24 percent this year, the second-worst performer on the 41-
member  S&P/TSX Financials Index .  
 (GMP will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. Toronto time.
