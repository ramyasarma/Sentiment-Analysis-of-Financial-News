             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell for a second day after a report showed
inflation was less than forecast, boosting speculation the
central bank will slow the pace of interest-rate increases.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 10.77 percent at 9:27 a.m. New York time. The yield
rose one basis point this week.  
 “This definitely indicates interest-rate increase
expectations will continue to move lower,” said  Bertrand Delgado , a senior economist at Roubini Global Economics LLC in
New York. “It seems that the inflation outlook will continue to
improve, so there’s not much of a necessity to continue with an
aggressive tightening cycle.”  
 Consumer prices, as measured by the benchmark IPCA index,
rose 0.01 percent in July, according to the national statistics
agency. The increase was less than the median forecast of 0.02
percent in a Bloomberg survey of 35 analysts. Twelve-month
inflation slowed to 4.6 percent from 4.84 percent in June.  
 The real fell 0.3 percent to 1.7568 per dollar, from 1.7518
yesterday. The currency dropped 0.1 percent this week.
