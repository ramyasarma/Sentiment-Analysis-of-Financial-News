             Flooding  swept away crops, houses and
damaged power equipment in North Korea, battering an economy
already straining under international  sanctions  and struggling
with shortages of food and goods.  
 Thousands of homes, public buildings and factories were
ruined and about 14,850 hectares of farmland “submerged, buried
or washed away,” North Korea’s state-run Korea Central News
Agency reported yesterday. Railways were blocked, power
equipment broken and bridges destroyed in the floods, the news
service said.  
 An unprecedented amount of rain had already inundated the
Yalu River system bordering China and more was forecast for the
region, Xinhua News Agency reported late yesterday, citing a
spokesman at the flood control headquarters in the border city
of Dandong on the river’s lower reaches. Liaoning and Jilin
provincial authorities suspended shipping on the river, it said.  
 The Tumen River, which forms North Korea’s northern border,
has also seen record water levels in the past two weeks, Xinhua
said.  
 The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, home to a large
ethnic Korean population, has suffered the worst floods in a
hundred years this year, with nearly a quarter of its 2.18
million residents affected, Xinhua said, citing the Yanbian
government.
