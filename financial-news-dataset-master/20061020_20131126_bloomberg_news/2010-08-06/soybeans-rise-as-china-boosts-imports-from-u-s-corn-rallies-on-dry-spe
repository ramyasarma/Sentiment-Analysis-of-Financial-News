             Soybeans rose, capping the longest
rally since 2007, as increased demand from China threatened to
erode stockpiles in the U.S., the largest exporter. Corn also
gained as hot, dry weather may limit U.S. crop yields.  
 The U.S. sold 336,000 metric tons of soybeans to China for
delivery after Sept. 1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today. China’s imports in the year ending Sept. 30 may be almost
50 million metric tons, a 22 percent jump from a year earlier,
the China National Grain & Oils Information Center said.  
 “It’s all about the rising Chinese demand for U.S.
soybeans,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “As long as China is
still buying, the market is going to be well supported.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 4.5 cents, or
0.4 percent, to close at $10.335 a bushel at 1:15 a.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price has increased for eight
straight sessions, the longest rally since September 2007. For
the week, soybeans gained 2.8 percent, the fourth rise in five
weeks.  
 Yesterday, the most-active contract touched $10.49, the
highest level since Jan. 7, after Russia imposed a ban on grain
exports as a drought damages crops.  
 Corn Outlook  
 In the U.S., hot, dry weather during the past two weeks
from Kansas to Indiana dimmed prospects for the corn crop, the
world’s largest.  Forecasts  for continued unfavorable weather
will reduce the amount of starch plants can put into kernels,
said  Mike Zuzolo , the president of Global Commodity Analytics &
Consulting LLC in Lafayette, Indiana.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to close at $4.20 a bushel in Chicago, capping a 3.3
percent gain for the week.  
 Yesterday, the most-active contract touched $4.39, the
highest price since June 15, 2009. Corn has gained 22 percent
since June 29, the day before the government said that U.S.
farmers planted less this year than they had planned.  
 The U.S. soybean crop was valued at $31.8 billion last
year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government figures
show.
