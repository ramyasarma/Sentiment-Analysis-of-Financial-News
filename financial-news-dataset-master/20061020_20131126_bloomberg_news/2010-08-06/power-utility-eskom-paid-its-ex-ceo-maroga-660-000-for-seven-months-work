             Eskom Holdings Ltd., South Africa’s
state-owned electricity utility, said it paid its former chief
executive officer  Jacob Maroga  4.8 million rand ($660,000) for
seven months work.  
 Eskom said Maroga resigned at the end of October last year,
while he said the company fired him citing “poor performance.”
Maroga petitioned the High Court to force Eskom to reinstate him
or pay him 85.7 million rand compensation. The court has yet to
deliver its ruling in the case.  
 Maroga was paid a salary of 3.5 million rand, a 1.27
million rand bonus and other payments totaling 54,000 rand in
the fiscal year through March, Johannesburg-based Eskom said in
its annual report, released in parliament in Cape Town
yesterday. He earned a total of 5 million rand the prior year.  
 Bobby Godsell  was paid 982,000 rand for the seven months
through November, when he resigned as Eskom’s chairman. He was
appointed to the post on July 17, 2008, and earned 740,000 rand
between then and the end of March 2009.  
 Brian Dames , who headed Eskom’s generation business in
fiscal 2009, was paid 5.7 million rand, 91 percent more than the
previous year. He was appointed as Eskom’s chief executive
officer in June.  Erica Johnson , head of Eskom’s customer network
business, earned 4.6 million rand, an 82 percent increase.
