             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
Coutts & Co. unit, which counts Queen Elizabeth II among its
clients, is being investigated by the U.K.’s financial regulator
for selling an American Life Insurance Company bond fund.  
 The Financial Services Authority last month opened an
investigation into the 318-year-old British private bank over
the sale of ALICO Premier Access Bond Enhanced Variable Rate
Fund to customers between 2001 and 2008, and the bank’s review
of those sales, RBS said today  in a statement .  
 “We can confirm the accuracy of that statement but we’ve
got no further comment to make at this time,” FSA spokesman
Christopher Hamilton said.  
 RBS, based in Edinburgh, said it is cooperating with the
probe.
