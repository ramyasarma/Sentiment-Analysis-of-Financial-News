             The  Bovespa  stock index fell, paring
the measure’s third weekly gain, after a report showed employers
added fewer jobs than forecast in the U.S., Brazil’s second-
largest trading partner.  
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, dropped for the first time in six sessions as crude
slid in New York. Steelmakers  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA  and
 Gerdau SA  fell as investors speculated the global economic
recovery may slow.  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo , the country’s
largest online retailer, and Souza Cruz SA, Brazil’s biggest
tobacco company, both tumbled after second-quarter net income
declined.  
 The  Bovespa  dropped 0.5 percent to 68,094.76 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo at 4 p.m. New York time. Forty-three
stocks fell while 20 rose. The real weakened 0.5 percent to
1.7596 per dollar.  
 “The market will continue to be sensitive to this kind of
news as investors still aren’t feeling totally safe,” said  Joao Pedro Brugger , who helps oversee 70 million reais ($39.8
million) at Leme Investimentos in Florianopolis, Brazil. “But
risk aversion is definitely lower than it was two months ago.
Foreign investors are starting to bet on emerging markets again,
especially Brazil, which is well-positioned with a solid,
transparent economy.”  
 The Bovespa completed a 0.9 percent rise this week for the
smallest weekly gain since June 25. The measure has advanced 17
percent from a May 20 low.  
 Brazilian  stocks  gained yesterday as telecommunications
companies rallied on speculation the industry will see more
mergers and acquisitions.  
 Recovery  
 Companies in the U.S. added workers in July for a seventh
straight month at a pace that suggests the labor-market recovery
will be slow to take hold.  
 Private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose by
71,000, less than forecast, after a gain of 31,000 in June that
was smaller than previously reported, Labor Department figures
in Washington showed today. Economists projected a 90,000 rise
in private jobs, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. Overall employment fell 131,000.  
 Brazil’s consumer prices rose 0.01 percent in July while
annual inflation slowed to 4.6 percent from 4.84 percent the
previous month, the national statistics agency said today. The
yield on the interest-rate futures contract due in January, the
most traded in Sao Paulo, fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 10.78 percent.  
 Petrobras  
 Petrobras declined 1.2 percent, the most since July 12, to
29.09 reais.  CSN , Brazil’s third-biggest steelmaker, fell 0.2
percent to 30.39 reais while  Gerdau , Latin America’s largest
steelmaker, lost 1.5 percent to 26.55 reais.  
 B2W dropped 7.3 percent to 30.59 reais after reporting
second-quarter net income fell 67 percent to 5 million reais
($2.84 million). Souza Cruz lost 4.5 percent to 74 reais after
saying profit fell 22 percent to 371 million reais in the second
quarter.  
 The  Bovespa index  trades for 13 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 12.2 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 16.2
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 14.9 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
