             American International Group Inc. ,
the insurer rescued by the U.S., posted a quarterly loss on
costs from businesses identified as discontinued operations.  
 The second-quarter net loss of $2.66 billion compares with
a profit of $1.82 billion a year earlier, the New York-based
firm said today in a regulatory filing.  
 “There’s a lot of noise with AIG in most quarters, with
all their moving pieces,” said  Julie Burke , managing director
at Fitch Ratings in Chicago.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  must increase
insurance profits and divest assets to repay AIG’s $182.3
billion rescue. The firm said last month it will hold a public
offering of its main Asia unit, AIA Group Ltd., after the
collapse in May of a $35.5 billion agreement to sell the
division to Prudential Plc.  
 AIG has reduced its debt on a Federal Reserve  credit line 
for seven of the past nine weeks. The insurer owes $23.7 billion
on the facility, compared with about $27 billion at the end of
April, according to data released by the Fed late yesterday.  
 The insurer agreed last month to a $725 million settlement
with investors who lost money amid the company’s share decline.
AIG will pay $175 million within 10 days of court approval, the
company said in a July 16 filing. AIG said it may sell common
stock to raise the remaining $550 million.  
 Bailed Out  
 AIG’s quarterly loss follows a $1.45 billion profit in the
first three months of this year. The company posted a $10.9
billion loss last year and a loss of almost $100 billion in 2008
fueled by writedowns tied to soured housing-market bets.  
 The insurer, once the world’s largest, was first rescued in
September 2008 by the Fed. After three revisions, the firm’s
lifeline includes the $60 billion Fed  credit line , a U.S.
Treasury Department investment of as much as $69.8 billion and
up to $52.5 billion to buy mortgage-linked assets owned or
backed by the company.  
 AIG agreed in March to sell another non-U.S. life insurance
division, American Life Insurance Co., to MetLife Inc. for $15.5
billion. Fitch Ratings said last month that AIG’s “re-
structuring plan has solidified meaningfully and capital market
conditions have improved,” since May of last year.  
 ‘Plus a Profit’  
 “I’m confident you’ll get your money, plus a profit,”
Benmosche told the Congressional Oversight Panel during a May
hearing into the AIG rescue and U.S. prospects of being repaid.  
 The insurer will pay down the Fed credit line after
completing the two life division divestitures and then turn to
its Treasury obligations, Benmosche has said. Treasury is
considering a plan to convert AIG preferred shares into common
stock and sell the holdings on the open market over two years, a
person with knowledge of talks with the insurer said in April.  
 AIG has  climbed  about 33 percent this year through
yesterday in New York trading, rewarding investors betting on a
rebound, including  Bruce Berkowitz , who runs Fairholme Capital
Management. Fairholme  owned  about 32.8 million shares as of June
30, the biggest stake after the U.S. government. The insurer
slipped 4.5 percent in 2009 and  plunged  97 percent in 2008.  
 Benmosche, 66, pushed for the resignation of  Harvey Golub 
as chairman after directors rejected a reduced bid for AIA that
the CEO endorsed, said two people with knowledge of the
insurer’s board meetings. Golub was replaced last month by  Steve Miller , 68, former CEO of auto-parts maker Delphi Corp.  
 ‘The Best Team’  
 Benmosche also ousted the head of  AIA , naming  Mark Tucker 
to succeed  Mark Wilson  on July 19. The hiring of Tucker, who was
previously CEO of Prudential and had built the London-based
insurer’s Asia operations, puts “the best team on the field”
for the unit’s initial public offering, Benmosche told staff.  
 AIG hired former U.S. Army Lt. Col.  Robert Bleimeister  and
 Mitchell Schultz , previously of Invesco Ltd., to improve AIG’s
human resources department, according to a June 2 staff memo.
Bleimeister, who was director of business strategy for the Army,
was named global head of human resources operations. Schultz
will oversee compensation and benefits.
