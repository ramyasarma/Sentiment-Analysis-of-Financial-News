             Southwestern Energy Co. , the largest
natural-gas producer in the Fayetteville Shale of Arkansas, said
development of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania may be slowed
if dry weather continues the next few months.  
 The dry weather means less water is available from the
nearby streams for use in the process known as hydraulic
fracturing,  Steven Mueller , chief executive officer at Houston-
based Southwestern, told investors today on a conference call.  
 “Fracking is tough in Pennsylvania,” Mueller said of the
process that pumps a mixture of water, sand and chemicals to
bust open rock about a mile underground to extract natural gas.
The company has about 150,800 acres in the Pennsylvania portion
of the Marcellus Shale, where it is currently operating one rig.  
 Gas producers also are dealing with a “headache”
regulatory environment in Pennsylvania, Mueller said.  
 The dry weather in northeast Pennsylvania has caused
regulators to restrict how much water can be drawn from nearby
streams, Mueller said. His company is now having to rely on
retention ponds for water.
