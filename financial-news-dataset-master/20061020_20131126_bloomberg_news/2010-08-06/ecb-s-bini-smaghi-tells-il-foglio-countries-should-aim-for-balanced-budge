              European Central Bank board member
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said governments should aim for balanced
budgets in “normal times,” according to an interview published
by Il Foglio today.  
 Bini Smaghi said he doesn’t see signs of deflation in the

spending will “take time,” according to the Italian newspaper.
