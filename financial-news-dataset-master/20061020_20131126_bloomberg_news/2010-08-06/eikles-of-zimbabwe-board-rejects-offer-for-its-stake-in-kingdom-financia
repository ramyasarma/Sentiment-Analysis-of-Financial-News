             Meikles Africa Ltd. , a Zimbabwean
company with interests in the retail and tea industries, said it
rejected an offer from former Chief Executive Officer  Nigel Chanakira  to buy its stake in Kingdom Financial Holdings Ltd.  
 Kingdom and Meikles merged in January 2008 to form Kingdom
Meikles Africa Ltd. Chanakira, who at the time was chief
executive of Kingdom Financial, was appointed CEO of Kingdom
Meikles. In June 2009, the companies said they planned to
separate following a disagreement between Chanakira and  John Moxon , the biggest shareholder in Meikles.  
 Shareholders were urged to exercise caution in their share
dealings until a meeting is held at a later date to discuss a
planned separation of the two companies, Meikles said in a
statement distributed by the Johannesburg stock exchange today.  
 A meeting to discuss the demerger set for Sept. 24 was
halted by riot police after the company was placed under state
supervision, amid a government clampdown on foreign-exchange
transactions by domestic companies. All state involvement in the
companies has now ended.  
 Meikles Africa owns TM Supermarkets, Zimbabwe’s biggest
retail chain, and Tanganda Tea Estates, the southern African
nation’s biggest producer of the leaf.
