             Japan’s land and infrastructure
ministry may seek between 15 billion and 30 billion yen ($174
million to $349 million) to extend by a year a program that
grants credit to consumers who build eco-friendly homes, the
Nikkei newspaper said. The funds are being sought for the fiscal
2011 budget. The program is set to expire in December, the
report said.
