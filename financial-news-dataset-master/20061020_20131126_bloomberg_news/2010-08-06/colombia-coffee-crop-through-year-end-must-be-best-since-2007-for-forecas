             Colombia, the world’s second-largest
producer of arabica coffee beans, will need its best year-end
crop since 2007 to meet growers’ forecasts for at least a 28
percent surge in production after last year’s 33-year low.  
 Producers must harvest 5.17 million bags through December
to meet the  Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee Growers 
forecast for annual output of 10 million tons. That would be the
biggest crop for the five-month period since production of 5.9
million bags in 2007, when annual output reached a nine-year
high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Coffee has rallied 24 percent in New York this year after
Colombia’s production shrank and investors speculated supply may
not meet demand. The nation’s output through July was almost
unchanged at 4.828 million bags, from 4.823 million bags a year
earlier, the federation reported yesterday. Colombia is the
largest producer of mild arabica beans after Brazil.  
 “Not many people have coffee to sell,”  Rodrigo Costa ,
vice president of institutional sales at Newedge USA LLC in New
York, said in a phone interview. “It doesn’t seem like we are
going to see a huge increase in production from Colombia.”  
 Growers in Colombia last month cut their output forecast to
between 10 million and 10.5 million bags, the lower end of a
prior estimate of 10 million to 11 million bags. In January,
growers had estimated 2010 output of as much as 12 million bags.
In 2009, annual output slumped 32 percent to 7.8 million bags.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery slid 2.9 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $1.6695 a pound at 11:11 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York.  
 July Production Rose  
 Production in July rose 35 percent to 787,000 bags from
582,000 bags a year earlier, signaling the end of a “critical”
period of low production, growers said in a statement yesterday.  
 Still,  rainfall  in Colombia may hamper a recovery in
production by depriving plants of sunlight and stunting growth
of coffee beans,  Jorge Lozano , head of Colombia’s National
Association of Coffee Exporters, said Aug. 4.  
 Wet weather in recent weeks has swollen rivers and
increased the risk of mudslides, according to the state-run
Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies.  
 Colombia fell to the world’s fourth-largest coffee producer
from third because of the October 2008 through Sept. 2009 crop,
according to the International Coffee Organization, which bases
its data on crop years starting October. 1.
