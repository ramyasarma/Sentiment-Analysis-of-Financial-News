             A U.S. veterans organization with 2.1
million members is demanding “full disclosure” on death
benefits that life insurers retain on behalf of deceased
military personnel and invest to boost company returns.  
 “Reports about life insurance companies profiting off our
war dead struck an emotional nerve at every level,” said Thomas
J. Tradewell Sr., national commander of the Kansas City,
Missouri-based  Veterans of Foreign Wars , in a statement dated
Aug. 4. “It may be a legal industry practice, but learning that
a company is earning more interest than what they pay out to
surviving families just reeks of corporate greed and
irresponsibility.”  
 U.S. life insurers, a group led by  MetLife Inc. , have
drawn criticism from state and national elected officials since
Bloomberg Markets magazine reported last week that more than 100
carriers profit by holding and investing $28 billion owed to
life insurance beneficiaries.  
 “We’re pushing for full disclosure,” Joe Davis, 54, a
spokesman for the VFW in Washington, said today in a telephone
interview. “These insurers are providing a valuable service,
but what they didn’t disclose was that they are also making
money off of it. That’s what stinks about this whole thing --
the fact that we didn’t know.”  
 New York Attorney General  Andrew Cuomo  opened a probe into
the practice last week and the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, which is responsible for regulating the industry,
said oversight must be improved. New York-based MetLife and No.
2  Prudential Financial Inc.  in Newark, New Jersey, were among
carriers subpoenaed by Cuomo.  
 The American Council of Life Insurers, an industry lobby
group, said this week it was “very proud” of the practice
because it gives the bereaved time to decide what to do with the
money.  
 The New York State Insurance Department plans to review
whether rules permit the retention of benefits. Defense
Secretary  Robert Gates  has pledged to help the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs investigate the practice on behalf of
families of deceased military personnel.  
 U.S. Senators  Charles Schumer , Democrat of New York, and
Arizona Republican  John McCain  have criticized the practice.
Representative  Debbie Halvorson , an Illinois Democrat,
introduced legislation last week requiring profit disclosure.
