             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ,
Asia’s biggest refiner, will process 4 percent more crude oil at
its Hainan plant in August compared with last month to meet
increased demand for marine fuels, a company official said.  
 The refinery plans to process 750,000 metric tons of crude
this month, or about 177,000 barrels a day, compared with
720,000 tons in July, said the official, who declined to be
identified because of company rules.  
 China bans fishing from June to August every year to help
conserve marine resources, cutting use of fuels used to power
boats. Demand for fuels is picking up as the ban begins to lift
for some places, the official said.  
 The 8 million ton-a-year plant in southern China is also
increasing oil processing after  Sinopec , as China Petroleum is
known, reduced purchases from other refiners, including
privately held plants, the official said.
