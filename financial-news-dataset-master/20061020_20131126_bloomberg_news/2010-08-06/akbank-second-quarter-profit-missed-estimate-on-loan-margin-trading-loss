             Akbank TAS , the Turkish bank part-
owned by Citigroup Inc., said second-quarter profit rose an
annual 3.9 percent, less than analysts expected, as margins from
lending narrowed and the bank made a loss from trading.  
 Net income was 759.1 million liras ($507 million) compared
with 730.3 million liras in the second quarter of last year,
Akbank told the Istanbul Stock Exchange today in a  filing . The
bank was expected to earn 877.6 million liras, according to the
 average estimate  of nine analysts questioned by Bloomberg.
Akbank had reported a profit of 967.8 million liras in the first
quarter, an increase of 56 percent from a year ago.  
 “Aggressive volume growth seems to have come with higher-
than-expected margin compression,”  Sevda Sarp , an analyst at
Istanbul-based broker Ata Invest, said in an e-mailed comment to
clients.  
 Banks in Turkey are cutting interest rates on loans to
compete for lending to consumers and businesses, as profit from
trading in bonds declined after the central bank slashed the
benchmark rate to a record low last year and then held it
steady. Akbank holds more lira bonds than any other non-
government bank.  
 Akbank was unchanged at 7.95 liras at the end of the first
trading session at 12:30 p.m. The main  ISE National 100  index
rose 0.5 percent.  
 Trading Losses  
 Net interest income declined an annual 7.5 percent to 1.08
billion liras in the second quarter, the statement said. Losses
from trading were 20.3 million liras, including a 134.5 million
liras loss from derivatives and a profit from other trading.
That compared with trading income of 47.7 million liras in the
second quarter of 2009, the statement said.  
 The losses from trading were unexpected,  Can Yurtcan , head
of research at Credit Agricole Cheuvreux in Istanbul, said in a
phone interview.  
 Loans  grew 19 percent from Dec. 31 to 47.2 billion liras,
the bank said. Fee income in the second quarter rose an annual
4.6 percent to 349.4 million liras. Income from other
operations, including revenue from collecting non-performing
loans, surged 87 percent to 242.1 million liras, it said.  
 Akbank is a partnership between Citigroup and  Haci Omer
Sabanci Holding AS , Turkey’s second biggest group of companies.
