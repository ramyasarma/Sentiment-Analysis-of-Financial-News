             The Polish government’s four-year
fiscal plan will keep public debt below 55 percent of economic
production, the threshold triggering mandatory spending cuts and
tax increases, according to the final document released today.  
 The plan forecasts that public debt will rise to 54.7
percent of gross domestic product this year, before declining to
53.7 percent by 2013. The estimates are based on assumptions
that  economic  growth will accelerate to 4.8 percent by 2012,
then slow to 4.1 percent in 2013.  
 Poland, which ships 80 percent of its exports to other
European Union countries, is betting on a recovery in western
Europe and its role as co-host of the 2012 European soccer
championships to drive growth. Consumer and investment demand
will weaken after the tournament, resulting in a “strong
reduction” of consumption as the government cuts spending to
reduce the budget deficit, according to the document.  
 “The assumptions are based on expectations that the euro-
zone economy will accelerate to about 2 percent in 2012 and
stabilize and that level the year after,” the government said
in the plan. “This means continuation of economic growth in
2011, with an additional boost in 2012, mainly in relation to
EURO 2012.”  
 Poland was the only EU member to avoid a recession last
year, though growth slowed to 1.8 percent, the worst in almost a
decade. As a result, the budget deficit widened to 7.1 percent
of GDP. Prime Minister  Donald Tusk ’s government, which had
pledged to bring the gap in line with the EU limit of 3 percent
by 2012, now says meeting the goal may take another year.  
 According to the government’s plan, the fiscal deficit will
be 80 billion zloty ($26.7 billion) this year, then fall to 75.8
billion zloty in 2011, 47.8 billion zloty in 2012 and 23.4
billion zloty in 2013.
