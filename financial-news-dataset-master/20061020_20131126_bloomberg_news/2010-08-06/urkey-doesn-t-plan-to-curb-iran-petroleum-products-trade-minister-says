             Turkey sees no reason to curb a trade
in petroleum products with neighbor Iran, Turkish Energy
Minister Taner Yildiz said.  
 United Nations sanctions on Iran don’t cover the trade and
“right now we believe that commercial companies can carry out
this business,” Yildiz said in Trabzon. “It’s a functioning
commercial relationship.”  
 He said the trade involves Turkish companies importing
crude oil from Iran and selling refined products to Iran in
return, Yildiz said. He didn’t give any figures for the size of
the trade.
