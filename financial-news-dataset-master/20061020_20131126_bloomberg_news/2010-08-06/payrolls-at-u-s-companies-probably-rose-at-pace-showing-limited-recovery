-- Company Hiring Probably Rose at Pace Showing Slow U.S. Rebound

             U.S. company hiring will be slow to
recover from the worst labor market since the end of World War
II, economists said before a government report today.  
 Private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose by
90,000 workers after growing by 83,000 in June, according to the
median estimate of 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
report may also show total employment fell by 65,000, reflecting
a drop in federal census workers, and the  jobless rate  rose.  
 The economy has recouped 11 percent of the 8.4 million jobs
lost in the recession that began December 2007, a proportion
that’s kept consumer spending from accelerating. While growth
has slowed and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has
described the outlook as “unusually uncertain,” financial
markets have rebounded: the Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  last
month climbed the most in a year and oil and copper rallied.  
 “It’s a bit of a pause in the very early stages of a
labor-market recovery,” said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist
at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. “If we’re
going to get continued growth and activity, firms have to hire.
The labor market is still incredibly weak.”  
 Today’s report will show the jobless rate rose to 9.6
percent last month from 9.5 percent in June, according to the
 survey  median. Unemployment, which reached a 26-year high of
10.1 percent in October, will take time to recede as the number
of previously discouraged jobseekers returning to the labor
force exceeds the number of available jobs, economists said.  
 Survey Results  
 The Labor Department report is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. in
Washington. Estimates from economists surveyed called for gains
in private employment ranging from 20,000 to 150,000.  
 Delta Air Lines Inc. , the world’s largest carrier, plans to
hire 1,000 workers at its 25 biggest U.S. airports to help with
planes that are flying with near-record percentages of seats
filled and cope with weather disruptions, Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Anderson  said last month.  
 Ford Motor Co. , the second-largest U.S. automaker, said
this week it plans to add 27 percent more positions at its U.S.
plants than originally planned. Ford agreed to add 1,975 jobs,
416 more than it originally intended, by 2012 to do work
traditionally done by suppliers. The jobs at nine U.S. plants
will be filled by a mix of idled current Ford workers and new
hires,  Jennifer Flake , a spokeswoman, said in an interview.  
 While Ford and Delta are adding,  United Technologies Corp. 
is among companies reducing payrolls. The Hartford, Connecticut-
based maker of Carrier, Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky products
said July 26 that it expects to cut about 2,400 hourly and
salaried positions. It eliminated 900 of the jobs as of June 30
and will cut the rest this and next year.  
 Census Jobs  
 Economists’ projections for total employment ranged from a
decline of 160,000 to an increase of 10,000. The Census Bureau
said it let go about 144,000 of the people conducting the
decennial population count from mid-June to mid-July. It still
had about  200,000  temporary workers on staff as of July 17,
indicating additional cuts to come that will keep distorting the
payroll figures for months.  
 For that reason, economists say private payrolls will be a
better gauge of the state of the labor market for much of 2010.
Companies added workers at a faster pace earlier this year,
boosting payrolls by 158,000 in March and 241,000 in April,
according to Labor Department figures.  
 Factory  payrolls  increased in July for the seventh straight
month, the survey showed. Manufacturers added 13,000 workers
after a gain of 9,000 in June.  
 Those gains may slacken as the industry leading the U.S.
economic expansion cools. A report this week from the Tempe,
Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management showed
manufacturing expanded in July at the  slowest pace  of the year
as new orders and production decelerated.  
 Materials Costs  
 Prices for industrial raw materials are signaling the
global economy will avoid falling back into recession, according
to  Edward Yardeni , president and chief investment strategist at
Yardeni Research Inc. in New York.  
 The Commodity Research Bureau/Reuters index of 13 materials
for immediate delivery, which Yardeni last month said was among
the best gauges of the economy’s current condition, has climbed
5.8 percent since reaching an almost four-month low on June 7.  
 The jobs report may help determine whether the Fed takes any
new measures aimed at boosting growth or sticks to its outlook
that the “extended period” of interest rates close to zero and
a near-record $2.3 trillion balance sheet will eventually bring
down unemployment.  
 “We have a considerable way to go to achieve a full
recovery in our economy,” Bernanke said in a speech to southern
U.S. state lawmakers in Charleston, South Carolina. Still,
“rising demand from households and businesses should help
sustain growth,” he said.  
 Fed’s Options  
 Options outlined by Bernanke last month include enhancing
the low-rate commitment, reducing the 0.25 percent rate the Fed
pays on banks’ reserve deposits and maintaining or expanding the
amount of assets on the balance sheet. The policy-making Federal
Open Market Committee next meets on Aug. 10.  
 The economy, jobs and the budget deficit are likely to be
top issues in November elections that will decide control of
Congress. Heading into the campaign season, the Obama
administration is facing public pessimism about the direction of
the economy.  
 More than 7 out of 10 Americans say the economy is still
mired in recession, and the country is conflicted over how to
balance concerns over joblessness and the federal budget
deficit, according to a Bloomberg National Poll.  
 Americans are torn about whether the federal government
should focus on curbing spending or creating jobs, the poll
conducted July 9-12 showed. Seven of 10 Americans say reducing
unemployment is the priority. At the same time, the public is
skeptical of the President  Barack Obama ’s stimulus program and
wary of more spending, with more than half saying the deficit is
“dangerously out of control.”  
 Support for Obama has fallen as the jobless rate has been
slow to retreat. His job approval over a three-day period ending
July 31 was 44 percent, compared with 54 percent at this time
last year, according to a Gallup poll.

    Consumer spending, pending home sales and factory orders were all weaker than projected in June, showing the U.S. recovery lost momentum heading into the second half of the year as employment stagnates. Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of the economy, were unchanged from May, according to figures from the Commerce Department issued Aug. 3 in Washington.
