             South African wheat prices rose by
their maximum daily limit on concern that other nations may
follow Russia’s export ban.  
 The grain for September delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, rose 100 rand, or 3.7
percent, to 2,818 rand ($389) per metric ton at the 9 a.m. open
in Johannesburg today.  
 Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Kazakhstan
and Belarus should also suspend shipments as Russia’s ban was
announced yesterday from Aug. 15 to the yearend.
