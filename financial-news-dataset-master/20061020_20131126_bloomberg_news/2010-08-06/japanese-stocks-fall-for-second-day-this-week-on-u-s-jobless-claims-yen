             Most Japanese  stocks  rose, sending
benchmark indexes to their third consecutive weekly advance, as
lower vacancies boosted real-estate developers for a second day
and companies reported higher earnings or forecasts.  
 Mitsubishi Estate Co. , Japan’s biggest developer by market
value, climbed 2.7 percent, extending gains from yesterday after
a private report showed Tokyo’s office vacancies fell in July
for the first time in 2 1/2 years. Nippon Sheet Glass Co. gained
5.6 percent after forecasting a return to profit. Softbank Corp.
dropped 1.7 percent on concern the mobile-phone company will
lose its exclusivity in supplying Apple Inc.’s iPhone 4 in Japan.  
 “The market was afraid the vacancy rate would go up, but
it looks closer to the bottom now,” said  Hidehiro Tomioka , who
helps manage about $306 billion in Tokyo at MFC Global
Investment Management (Japan) Ltd. “Earnings have been good so
far, slightly better than the market expected. The markets will
now be looking more ahead at the risk of the economy slowing.”  
 About three stocks advanced for every two that declined in
the  Topix  index, which rose 0.5 percent to 861.17 at the close
of trading in Tokyo. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.1
percent to 9,642.12. This week, the Nikkei climbed 1.1 percent
and the Topix gained 1.4 percent.  
 This year, the Topix has lost 5.1 percent as Europe’s debt
crisis and China’s steps to cool its property market dented
confidence in a global economic recovery. The decline cut the
average price of stocks in the gauge to 16.3 times  estimated
earnings , less than half the multiple in January.  
 Property Developers Rise  
 Real-estate companies  gained the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups for a second day. A report yesterday by Miki
Shoji Co., a privately held brokerage, showed Tokyo’s office-
vacancy rate fell in July for the first time since January 2008.  
 Mitsubishi Estate, Japan’s biggest developer by market
value, advanced 2.7 percent to 1,311 yen, and  Mitsui Fudosan Co. ,
No. 1 by sales, rose 3.9 percent to 1,392 yen. Sumitomo Realty &
Development Co., the country’s third-largest developer, climbed
4.1 percent to 1,694 yen. All three were among the top-10
contributors to the Topix’s increase.  
 “We reiterate our bullish investment outlook for the three
major Japanese real-estate companies,”  Takashi Hashimoto , an
analyst at Barclays Plc in Tokyo, said in a report dated Aug. 5.
“It remains to be seen whether the improving trend will remain
in place as the economy slows, but we believe a turning point is
definitely approaching.”  
 Nippon Sheet Glass  jumped 5.6 percent to 227 yen, the
biggest gain in the Nikkei 225, after the glassmaker forecast
full-year net income of 1 billion yen, reversing a previous
projection for a net loss of 4 billion yen.  
 Exceeding Analyst Estimates  
 Fukuyama Transporting Co.  soared 7.7 percent to 446 yen,
the biggest increase among the 500 largest companies in the
Topix. The provider of moving services said first-quarter
operating profit gained by 25 percent to 3.83 billion yen ($44
million) on a 15 percent advance in sales.  
 About half the companies in the Nikkei 225 that have
reported earnings per share for last quarter have  exceeded
analyst estimates , while 25 percent have missed them, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The Nikkei 225 closed below 10,000 for the 12th consecutive
week, the longest such streak since June 2009. The gauge ended
last year at 10,546.44. It has finished a year below 10,000  only
twice  since first exceeding the level in January 1984: in 2002
and 2008.  
 Softbank, which operates Japan’s third-largest mobile-phone
network and is the country’s exclusive provider of Apple’s
iPhone, retreated 1.7 percent to 2,507 yen. The Nikkei newspaper
said Japan Communications Inc. will soon start a service that
allows the handset to be used on NTT DoCoMo Inc.’s network.  
 Softbank, NTT, DoCoMo  
 Softbank was the biggest drag on the Topix and the second-
most active stock by value in Japan. NTT DoCoMo, the country’s
largest mobile network, gained 2.8 percent to 140,900 yen. Its
parent, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., jumped 3.2 percent
to 3,735 yen. NTT and NTT DoCoMo were the second- and third-
 biggest contributors  to the Topix’s advance.  
 Mitsumi Electric Co.  tumbled 8.3 percent to 1,289 yen, the
sharpest decline in the Nikkei 225, after the maker of
electronic components for customers including Nintendo Co. cut
its full-year profit forecast by 89 percent, citing lower-than-
expected demand for “amusement-related” products.  
 Terumo Corp.  dropped 3.3 percent to 4,585 yen after the
maker of thermometers and blood-pressure gauges said net income
slid 19 percent in the April-June quarter. It was the second-
biggest drag on the Nikkei 225.
