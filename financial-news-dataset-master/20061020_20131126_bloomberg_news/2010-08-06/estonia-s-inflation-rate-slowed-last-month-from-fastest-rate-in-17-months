             Estonian  inflation  slowed in July
from the fastest rate in 17 months after tax increases a year
earlier stopped affecting the annual comparison.  
 The inflation rate declined to 2.9 percent from 3.5 percent
in June, the Tallinn-based statistics office said today on its
website. Prices rose 0.3 percent for the month.  
 The central bank has warned in past months higher prices
may hamper the Baltic nation’s recovery from  the second-deepest
recession  in the European Union in 2008 and 2009. Estonia is set
to become the 17th country to adopt the euro in January.  
 “There are really no price pressures in the domestic
economy,” Finance Minister  Jurgen Ligi  said in an interview
last month. “Recent price increases have been largely due to
external price pressures, like oil. Still, some entrepreneurs
here may be tempted to raise prices in the run-up to euro
adoption, but this is not a big worry.”
