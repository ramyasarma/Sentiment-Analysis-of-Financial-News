             Treasury two-year  note yields  dropped
below 0.50 percent for the first time after the government’s
payrolls report showed the economy lost more jobs in July than
economists forecast.  
 Bonds were headed for a weekly rally as hiring by private
employers trailed estimates from analysts, encouraging
speculation that a stalled recovery may force the Federal
Reserve to provide more stimulus.  Bill Gross  of Pacific
Investment Management Co. said a plunge in two-year yields
indicates investors should buy longer-maturity securities.  
 “The markets are correct to be pessimistic about economic
growth going forward,” said  Gary Pollack , who helps oversee
$12 billion as head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank
AG’s private wealth management unit in New York. “We’ll
continue to set new lows on two-year yields for the next month
or so.”  
 The  yield  on the 10-year note decreased four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.86 percent at 10:04 a.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.5
percent security maturing in May 2020 climbed 3/8, or $3.75 per
$1,000 face amount, to 105 13/32.  
 The two-year note  yield  slid one basis point to 0.53
percent after falling to the all-time low of 0.4977 percent and
was down three basis points for the week. The 10-year note yield
touched 2.8398 percent, the lowest level since April 2009. The
30-year bond yield decreased three basis points to 4.02 percent.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year notes
instead of 2-year debt dropped two basis points to 235 basis
points. It fell to 227.5 basis points on July 1, reflecting the
flattest yield curve since October.  
 Gross on Curve  
 “When you get down to 50 basis points on two-years, that’s
giving you a signal that there’s not much left on the table,”
Gross, founder and co-chief investment officer at Newport Beach,
California-based Pimco, said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “So the extension out on the
yield curve is what we’ve been attempting over the past several
weeks and the past several months.”  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange showed a 32 percent
chance the Fed will raise its target rate for overnight lending
between banks at least a quarter-percentage point by the August
2011 meeting, compared with 49 percent odds a week ago.  
 St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  wrote in a paper
released last week that the central bank should resume purchases
of Treasuries if the economy slows and prices fall. Philadelphia
Fed President  Charles Plosser  said in a Bloomberg News interview
that calls for more Fed stimulus are premature.  
 Fed’s Target Range  
 The Fed has maintained a range of zero to 0.25 percent for
its benchmark rate since December 2008 to encourage the economic
recovery. Policy makers meet next week on Aug. 10.  
 The central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates for
two to three years, according to Gross. The Fed is on hold “for
a long, long time,” he said in the radio interview.  
 U.S. economic growth slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in
the second quarter from a 3.7 percent pace in the first three
months of the year. Consumer spending, pending home resales and
factory orders were weaker in June than projected.  
 Non-farm U.S. payrolls lost 131,000 positions in July after
a revised reduction of 221,000 in the previous month, the Labor
Department reported today. The median forecast of 84 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a reduction of 65,000. The
unemployment rate stayed at 9.5 percent.  
 Private payrolls excluding government rose by 71,000 after
a June gain of 31,000 that was smaller than previously reported.
Economists projected an increase of 90,000 in July.  
 Benchmark 10-year note  yields  rose on five of the past
seven announcements of non-farm payrolls figures. The yields
fell 4 basis points on Feb. 5, when the government announced
unexpected job losses, and dropped 16 basis points on June 4,
when the report showed employers added fewer jobs than
economists forecast.
