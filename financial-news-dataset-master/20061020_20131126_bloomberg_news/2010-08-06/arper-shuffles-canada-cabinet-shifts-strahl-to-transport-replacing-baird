             Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  made changes to his cabinet that included replacing his
party’s leader in the legislature and appointing a new transport
minister.  
 Chuck Strahl , formerly minister of Indian Affairs, replaces
 John Baird  at transport. Baird becomes government House Leader,
replacing  Jay Hill , who is not seeking re-election.  John Duncan 
replaces Strahl. The ministers were sworn in at a ceremony in
Ottawa today.  
 The Conservatives’ lead over the main opposition Liberals
has shrunk in recent weeks, polls show, amid controversy over
the government’s decision to eliminate a mandatory census.  
 The Conservatives had the support of 29.7 percent of
voters, versus 28.5 percent for the opposition Liberal Party,
according to a poll released yesterday by Ekos Research
Associates. The Conservatives held an 11-point lead in mid-July,
Ekos said.
