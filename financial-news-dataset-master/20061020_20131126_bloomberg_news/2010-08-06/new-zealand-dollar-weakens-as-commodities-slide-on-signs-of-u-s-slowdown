             The Australian dollar gained against
the greenback for a third straight week as data showed U.S.
payrolls dropped more than expected last month, damping demand
for American assets.  
 The New Zealand dollar fell for a second day against the
yen, adding to a second weekly loss, as traders cut bets the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand will raise interest rates next
month. Demand for Australia’s currency was limited after the
Reserve Bank of Australia said the nation’s economic expansion
is unlikely to stoke inflation pressures.  
 “People are concentrating more on interest-rate
differentials than the risk-aversion play,”  John Doyle , a
strategist in Washington at currency-trading firm Tempus
Consulting Inc., said after the U.S. payrolls data. “This
chronically worse jobs data coming out is likely to continue to
give the U.S. Fed scope to keep rates near zero for an extended
period of time. That’s why the dollar sold off so rapidly.”  
 The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to 91.43 U.S. cents
at 1:10 p.m. in New York, from 91.61 cents yesterday, paring a
weekly gain to 1.1 percent. The Aussie touched 92.22 U.S. cents,
the strongest since May 4. It fell 0.8 percent for the day and
0.2 percent for the week to 77.99 yen, from 78.60 yen.  
 The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell 0.3
percent versus the greenback today and rose 0.4 percent for the
week to 72.88 U.S. cents. It traded at 62.15 yen, down 0.9
percent for the day and 1 percent for the week.  
 Job Losses  
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls lost 131,000 positions last month,
Labor Department data showed today, compared with a drop of
65,000 forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 84 economists. The
economy shed a revised 221,000 jobs in June, the first monthly
loss this year. Private payrolls that exclude government
agencies rose by 71,000 in July, less than forecast.  
 Federal Reserve officials meet Aug. 10 on interest rates
and policy. They have kept the benchmark U.S. interest rate at a
record low range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to
help spur economic growth.  
 The Reserve Bank of Australia kept its benchmark rate
unchanged this week at 4.5 percent.  
 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its key rate to 3
percent last week while signaling that deteriorating growth will
slow the pace of increases.
