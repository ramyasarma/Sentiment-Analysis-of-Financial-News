             Standard Bank Group Ltd. ’s Kenyan
unit posted a 47 percent increase in first-half profit as income
from foreign-currency trading surged. The stock headed for a 21-
month high.  
 Net income climbed to 725.3 million shillings ($9.1
million), or 5.94 shillings a share, in the six months through
June, from 493 million shillings, or 4.04 shillings, in the same
period a year earlier,  CFC Stanbic Bank Ltd.  said in a statement
published in the Nairobi-based Daily Nation newspaper today.  
 Operating income jumped 51 percent as non-interest revenue
more than doubled, boosted by gains on “the sale of financial
instruments as well as higher forex sales,” CFC said. Foreign-
exchange trading income increased 67 percent to 747.3 million
shillings while money made from interest charged on loans
declined 1.6 percent to 1.82 billion shillings, it said.  
 Banks in Kenya have posted higher earnings as growth in
East Africa’s biggest economy accelerates and after the central
bank slashed interest rates to the lowest level in four years to
boost the expansion of credit to businesses and households.  
 Last week, the  Central Bank of Kenya  cut its benchmark
interest rate by 0.75 percentage points to 6 percent. Average
lending rates at Kenyan banks fell to 14.39 percent in June from
15.1 percent a year earlier. Njuguna Ndung’u, the governor of
the central bank, has asked commercial banks to lower their
rates to spur economic growth that is expected to accelerate to
between 4 and 5 percent this year from 2.6 percent in 2009.  
 ‘Wide Spreads’  
 Last month,  Equity Bank Ltd. , Kenya’s largest lender by
market value, posted a 44 percent increase in first-half profit
as lending income surged by a similar margin.  Kenya Commercial
Bank Ltd. , the country’s biggest lender by branches reported a
26 percent improvement in first-half profit as loans grew by a
quarter.  
 “They have had a strong rebound in profits even before the
economy bounced back and investors are attracted because of the
possibility they will perform better in a higher GDP
environment,”  Aly Khan Satchu , a Nairobi-based independent stock
market analyst, said in a phone interview today. “The banks made
a lot of cash because the spreads are wide.”  
 CFC’s stock advanced as much as 4 shillings, or 4.7
percent, to 90 shillings and was trading at 87 shillings at 2:05
p.m. in Nairobi. A close at the level would be the highest since
Nov. 19, 2008. The share’s value  surged  93 percent so far this
year, outperforming a 40 percent rise in the Nairobi Stock
Exchange’s benchmark NSE  All Share index , according to Bloomberg
data.  
 Standard Bank, based in Johannesburg, is Africa’s largest
bank by assets.
