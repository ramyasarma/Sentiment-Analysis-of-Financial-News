              U.K.-listed copper miners have
missed forecasts for production by 40,000 metric tons based on
earnings so far, mainly because of “lower grades,” Citigroup
Inc. said.  
 “Copper market fundamentals continued to surprise us on
the upside this quarter,” Citigroup analyst Anindya Mohinta
said in a report today.
