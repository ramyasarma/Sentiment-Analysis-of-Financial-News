             Crude oil may fall next week on
speculation that U.S. fuel inventories will climb as demand
declines, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Twenty-eight of 46 analysts, or 61 percent, forecast crude
oil will decline through Aug. 13. It was the most bearish result
since July 2009. Twelve respondents, or 26 percent, predicted
that futures will increase and six saw little change. Last week
42 percent of analysts forecast a drop.  
 Gasoline supplies  increased 729,000 barrels, or 0.3
percent, to 223 million last week, the highest level since April
30, an Aug. 4 Energy Department report showed. Stockpiles of
distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, rose 2.17 million barrels to 169.7 million, the highest
level since the week ended Oct. 16.  
 “Fundamentals show a U.S. market that is still
overstocked, particularly on the product side,” said  Tim Evans ,
an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.
“This leaves the market vulnerable to downdrafts like the one
we saw in May.”  
 Oil in New York tumbled to $64.24 on May 20, the lowest
intraday price since July 30, 2009.  
 U.S. fuel consumption  dropped  2.5 percent to 19.3 million
barrels a day last week, according to the Energy Department.  
 Crude oil inventories in the 15-state Midwest rose to 97.7
million barrels in the week ended July 30, the highest level
recorded since the data started in 1990, the report showed.  
 Crude oil for September delivery increased $1.75, or 2.2
percent, to $80.70 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are up 12 percent from a year ago.  
 The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  

 
     Bloomberg’s survey of oil analysts and traders, conducted
each Thursday, asks for an assessment of whether crude oil
futures are likely to rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming
week. The results were:

     RISE      NEUTRAL    FALL
     12         6         28
