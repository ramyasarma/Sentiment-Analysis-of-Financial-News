             Vodacom Group Ltd. is being sued for
more than $40 million by Namemco Energy for failing to pay a 5
percent commission-based consultancy fee for work it did in the
the Democratic Republic of Congo, The Times reported, citing
court documents.  
 Namemco mediated negotiations between Vodacom and Congolese
Wireless Networks when Vodacom wanted to buy the 49 percent
stake held by CWN in Vodacom Congo Sprl, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper cited the court papers as saying. Vodacom has received
the court papers, spokesman Richard Boorman said in a mobile-
phone interview today when contacted by Bloomberg News,
declining to comment further on the case.
