             German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
popularity declined in August even as expectations of an
economic revival increased, an Infratest Dimap  poll  for ARD
public television showed.  
 Forty-one percent of respondents said they’re happy with
the way Merkel’s doing her job, a two percentage-point decline
from July, ARD said. That puts her in seventh place on the
popularity list, with Defense Minister  Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg , at 71 percent support, taking the top spot.  
 Half the respondents said they expect the economy to be in
better shape one year from now than today, an increase of 6
percentage points from November, when Infratest last asked the
question. Forty-two percent said the current economic situation
is “good,” up from 19 percent last September.  
 Merkel’s popularity dropped even after German  unemployment 
fell in July to the  lowest since  November 2008. German stocks
climbed to the highest since September 2008 during yesterday’s
trading after the Economy Ministry said manufacturing orders in
June rose more than twice as much as economists forecast.  
 Infratest interviewed 1,000 people on Aug. 2-3. The margin
of error was as wide as 3.1 percentage points.
