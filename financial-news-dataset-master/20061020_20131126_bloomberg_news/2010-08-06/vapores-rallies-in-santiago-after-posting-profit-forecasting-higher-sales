             Cia. Sudamericana de Vapores SA  rose
to a two-year high in Santiago trading after reporting its first
quarterly profit in two years and forecasting higher earnings
this quarter.  
 Latin America’s largest container shipping company climbed
3.7 percent to 567 pesos at 12:24 p.m. New York time, the
highest intraday level since September 2008.   
 The company controlled by Chile’s Claro family had second-
quarter net income of $68.8 million compared with a $140 million
loss a year earlier, according to a  statement  posted today on
the website of Chile’s securities regulator. In an accompanying
statement, it forecast an increase in profit this quarter from
the second quarter on higher volumes and prices.
