             India’s  10-year bonds  are poised for
their third weekly loss on concern the  central bank  will add to
this year’s four interest-rate increases to damp inflation.  
 Reserve Bank of India Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  will
tighten monetary policy if excessive consumer demand stokes
inflation, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said yesterday. The
government will sell 130 billion rupees ($2.8 billion) of debt
today, which may cool demand for existing securities. It two
days ago raised 85 billion rupees via bill sales.  
 “The hawkish stance of the policy makers continues to
worry investors,” said  Devendra Das , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “Persistent sales of bonds
are also hurting appetite.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due in May 2020 rose
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, this week to 7.88
percent as of 10:44 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate touched 7.91 percent yesterday,
the highest level in more than three months. The price fell 0.54,
or 54 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 99.43.  
 The yield on the 10-year bond has climbed 17 basis points
since the central bank last raised borrowing costs on July 27.
The  RBI  increased the  reverse-repurchase rate , at which it
absorbs excess cash from banks, by half a percentage point to
4.5 percent. It lifted the repurchase rate, which it charges on
overnight loans, to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent.  Inflation  in
July stayed above 10 percent for a fifth month.  
 The central bank’s decision to review its policy every one-
and-a-half months suggests interest rates may be increased more
frequently, Das said. The 10-year  bond yield  may move between
7.90 percent and 8 percent next week, he said.  
 The  finance ministry  will sell bonds maturing in 2017, 2022
and 2032 today, which are part of its record 4.57 trillion
rupees borrowing program for the fiscal year that began April 1.
