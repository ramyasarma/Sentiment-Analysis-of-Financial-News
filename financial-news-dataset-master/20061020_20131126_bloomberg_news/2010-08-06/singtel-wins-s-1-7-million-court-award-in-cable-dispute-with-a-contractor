             Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. ,
Southeast Asia’s largest phone company, won a S$1.7 million
($1.3 million) award in a cable dispute with a contractor.  
 Sin Lian Heng Construction Pte sued SingTel in 2006 over
unpaid bills for work on the phone company’s cable ducting
network. SingTel countersued, claiming Sin Lian Heng breached
the contract and wrongfully kept the cables.  
 Justice Lee Seiu Kin dismissed Sin Lian Heng’s claim and
ruled in favor of SingTel, in an Aug. 2 decision, released today.  
 SingTel’s award takes into account a S$2 million
settlement with Sin Lian Heng for the unpaid bills, Lee
said. Both companies have appealed the ruling, Lee said.  
 The cases are Sin Lian Heng Construction Pte v Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. S525/2006 and Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. v Sin Lian Heng Construction Pte
S532/2006 in the Singapore High Court.
