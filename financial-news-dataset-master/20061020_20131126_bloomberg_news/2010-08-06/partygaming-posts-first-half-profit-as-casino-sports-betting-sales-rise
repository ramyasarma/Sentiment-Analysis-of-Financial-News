             PartyGaming Plc , the Internet
gambling company planning to acquire  Bwin Interactive
Entertainment AG , posted a first-half profit as casino games and
sports betting sales rose.  
 Net income  was 19.7 million euros ($26 million), compared
with a loss of 46.5 million euros in the same period a year
earlier, the Gibraltar-based company said in a Regulatory News
Service statement today. Revenue rose 30 percent to 181.2
million euros.  
 Casino sales climbed 23 percent to 76.4 million euros.
Sports betting revenue climbed 89 percent to 10.2 million euros
as soccer World Cup wagering helped compensate for a drop in
poker sales as players were distracted by the tournament.  
 “We have continued to consolidate our position as the
world’s largest online casino,” Chief Executive Officer  Jim Ryan  told reporters on a conference call. The company added 80
games during 2009, and plans 50 more in 2010, he said.  
 PartyGaming and Bwin said last month they would combine to
create the world’s biggest publicly traded online gambling
company. The deal is expected to close early next year.  
 “It will widen the gap between the combined company and
the rest of the market,” Ryan told reporters. “We will have
the size, scale and management to continue our leadership.”  
 PartyGaming rose  2.9 pence, or 1 percent, to 291.3 pence at
8:59 a.m. in London. The shares have increased 12 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 1.2 billion pounds
($1.9 billion).  
 First-half bingo revenue soared to 25.8 million euros from
1.2 million euros a year earlier after the company acquired
Cashcade Ltd. last year.  
 PartyGaming showed a loss a year ago as it took a $101
million charge against earnings to cover payments to the U.S.
Justice Department to avoid prosecution for offering Web
gambling in the country before it was barred in October 2006.
