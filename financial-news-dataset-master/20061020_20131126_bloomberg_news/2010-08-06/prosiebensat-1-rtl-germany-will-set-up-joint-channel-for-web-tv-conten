             RTL Group SA  and  ProSiebenSat.1
Media AG  announced a joint Internet platform for free
television in Germany and Austria.  
 The joint venture will allow public and private TV
channels to put content online, where it can be streamed by
users, the companies said in an e-mailed statement. The TV
channels will pay for use of the technical infrastructure and
services. An application for approval by the European
Commission will be submitted today.  
 TV channels are looking to build their online presence to
compete with illegal sites and offset a decline in traditional
advertising revenue.  ITV Plc,  the U.K.’s biggest commercial
broadcaster, this week said it would invest in its website to
better compete with rival British Broadcasting Corp.’s online
player.  
 The joint-venture platform “will strengthen competition
in the German and Austrian market, and is intended to help to
put participating TV channels in a strong position,” the
companies said in today’s statement.  
 In the U.S., Internet TV is being offered via televisions
as well as computers and mobile devices. In June, Hulu LLC, a
TV website controlled by three U.S. broadcast networks, began
promoting its Hulu Plus paid online service on Samsung TVs.
