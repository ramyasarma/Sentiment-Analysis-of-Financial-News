             Colombia’s peso bonds jumped, pushing
yields to a four-year low, after a government report showed
consumer prices unexpectedly declined last month.  
 The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due 2020 fell
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.24 percent at
3:31 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s stock exchange.
That’s the lowest level on a closing basis since March 2006. The
bond’s price climbed 0.707 centavo to 126.073 centavos per peso.  
 Consumer prices fell 0.04 percent in July from the previous
month, the national statistics agency said in a report late
yesterday. Economists had predicted a 0.1 percent increase,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The report “will help continue pushing gains in the bonds
as lower inflation increases the returns” on the fixed-rate
debt, said  Alexander Cardenas , head of research at brokerage
Acciones y Valores SA in Bogota. “It shows inflation is under
control, and that the central bank can maintain low rates for
longer.” He forecasts yields on the 2020 bond will fall to 7.1
percent by next week.  
 Annual inflation  was 2.24 percent in July, within the
central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target for this year.  
 Colombia’s central bank in July left the  overnight lending 
rate unchanged for a third month at a record low of 3 percent.
Cardenas forecasts policy makers will lift interest rates in
January or February.  
 The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,816.1 per U.S. dollar,
from 1,818.35 yesterday. The currency rose 1.5 percent in the
last five days, its third straight week of gains. The peso has
jumped 12.5 percent this year, the best performance among world
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
