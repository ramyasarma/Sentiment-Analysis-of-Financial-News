             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  declined for a fourth day, retreating 245.76, or 0.9
percent, to 28,282.12 in Johannesburg. The index lost 0.3
percent this week.  
 The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  
 Absa Group Ltd.  (ASA SJ), the Barclays Plc-controlled bank,
fell 3.50 rand, or 2.6 percent, to 130.60 rand, for a retreat of
4 percent this week. The bank was downgraded to “hold” from
“buy” at Deutsche Bank AG.  
 Aveng Ltd.  (AEG SJ), a construction company, rose 88 cents,
or 2.4 percent, to 37.75 rand, a second day of gains. Aquarius
Platinum Ltd. dropped a 963 million-rand ($132.9 million)
damages claim, Aveng said in a statement.  
 Buildmax Ltd.  (BDM SJ), a mining and construction industry
supplier, fell 5 cents, or 17 percent, to 24 cents, its biggest
drop since June 25. If the rights offer fails to raise the 300
million rand target, “Buildmax may not be in a position to
continue its operations in the current form,” according to a
statement.  
 Impala Platinum Ltd.  (IMP SJ), the world’s second-biggest
platinum producer, slumped 6.95 rand, or 3.4 percent, to 198
rand. Workers at its South African operations are considering
whether to go on a wage strike, according to the National Union
of Mineworkers.  
 Lonmin Plc  (LON SJ) declined 8.10 rand, or 4.3 percent, to
181.30 rand, its biggest drop since May 20. South Africa’s
government ordered the mining company to halt sales of non-
platinum-group metals after awarding the rights for a “small”
part of the non-platinum resources on Lonmin’s Western Platinum
Ltd. and Eastern Platinum Ltd. sites to a unit of the country’s
Holgoun Group. Lonmin said it would seek an urgent court ruling
to overturn the order.
