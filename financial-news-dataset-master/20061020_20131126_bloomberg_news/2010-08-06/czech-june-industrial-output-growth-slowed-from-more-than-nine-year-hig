             Czech industrial output growth slowed
from the fastest pace in more than nine years on smaller
increase in manufacturing production.  
 Overall output  increased  an annual 9.7 percent in June,
compared with growth of 16.9 percent in the previous month, the
statistics office in Prague said on its website today. The May
reading was the fastest increase since January 2001. The median
forecast of 10 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for an
increase of 10.3 percent.  
 The Czech Republic is recovering from the worst recession
since the end of communism in 1989 after demand for its
products, such as cars made by Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto AS,
crumbled last year and pushed the public finance deficit to 5.9
percent of gross domestic product.  
 Construction output dropped 4.7 percent in June, compared
with a 0.5 increase in May, the statistics office said in a
separate statement today.
