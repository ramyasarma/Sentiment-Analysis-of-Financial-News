             Taiwan and China should end their
“tug of war” to gain diplomatic recognition with countries
around the world and instead focus on deepening economic and
cultural ties, former Kuomintang Party Chairman  Lien Chan  said.  
 “We hope there will be a diplomatic truce,” Lien said in
an interview yesterday in Taipei. “We don’t need to waste our
money to draw back some countries into our fold.”  
 The comments from Lien, who in 2005 became the first KMT
official to visit China, follow the signing of the first trade
accord between Taiwan and the mainland in June. During the 2005
visit Lien led a delegation of Taiwanese businessmen to Beijing,
where he met Chinese President  Hu Jintao .  
 Since 1949 when the KMT fled to Taiwan after its defeat by
 Mao Zedong ’s communists in China’s civil war, China and Taiwan
have battled for official recognition, with countries choosing
one or the other. Taiwan has full diplomatic relations with 23
countries, including El Salvador and Guatemala. China considers
the island of Taiwan a renegade province.  
 The June trade deal with China, known as the Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement, paved the way for the island to
pursue trade deals with other nations.  
 “Some countries were very frank with us and said ‘you need
to reach some kind of agreement with the mainland first and then
we can proceed,’” Lien said.  
 Singapore and Taiwan released a joint statement yesterday
saying they will study an economic cooperation agreement and
will meet later this year for discussions.  
 Taiwan is seeking deals with other Southeast Asian countries
after a trade accord took effect in January between China and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, lowering tariffs on
two-way trade.
