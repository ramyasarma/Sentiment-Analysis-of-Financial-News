             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  said
it sold bonds from nations such as Portugal and Greece at a loss
of 105 million pounds ($167 million), “de-risking” its
portfolio in the wake of the sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “Losses were realized during the first half of the year on
disposal of a portfolio of lower-rated sovereign debt
securities, including Greece and Portugal,” the Edinburgh-based
bank said today as it reported earnings. “The group continued
to reduce exposures to countries with credit ratings of A+ or
below during the second quarter.”  
 Bonds from nations on Europe’s periphery slumped in the
first half, with the  Greek 10-year yield  surging to a record of
more than 12 percent, on speculation the countries would
struggle to finance their debt. The losses forced a European
Union and International Monetary Fund bailout, including the
purchase of securities by the European Central Bank. RBS has
been Britain’s biggest government-owned lender since 2008, when
it was rescued in the wake of the credit crunch.  
 The bank, which reported its first profit today since 2007,
said it disposed of 300 million pounds of  Greek bonds  in the
second quarter. A table of available-for-sale debt securities in
the statement shows holdings of Spanish, Irish and Portuguese
government securities were also reduced.  
 The company reinvested the proceeds from maturing U.K.
securities in debt from other nations among the so-called Group
of 10, primarily in  U.S. government securities , it said.  
 ‘Vulnerable States’  
 “Euro zone country exposures were and continue to be
tightly managed given the pressures on vulnerable member
states,” the bank said. “Overall reductions, in-depth reviews
and de-risking of portfolios were applied to Greece, Spain,
Portugal, Italy and Ireland.”  
 Greece was cut four steps to non-investment grade, or junk,
by Moody’s Investors Service on June 14, two months after
Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit rating to sub-investment
level. Portugal had its credit rating cut two levels to A1 by
Moody’s on July 13. S&P rates Portugal A- since a downgrade on
April 27, while Fitch Ratings gives the nation an AA- grade.
