             Sugar output at Uganda’s three
biggest plants was 9 percent lower than expected in the first
half after two factories closed for maintenance, the Uganda
Sugar Cane Technologists’ Association.  
 Production totaled 135,110 metric tons in the six months
through June, compared with a forecast of 148,358 tons,
Wilberforce Mubiru, chief executive officer of the association,
said in an interview today in the capital, Kampala. Output in
the first half of 2009 was 134,850 tons.  
 “The closure for maintenance of the two plants for over a
month each affected our targets for the period, but we hope to
get the targets for the year,” he said.  
 Kakira Sugar Works Ltd., the biggest producer, and Sugar
Corp., the smallest, both closed for maintenance during the
period, he said. Kakira is owned by Madhvani Group, which says
it is the biggest private investor in Ugandan industries. Sugar
Corp. is jointly held by Uganda’s government and Mumbai, India-
based Mehta Group. Together with Kinyara, the three companies
account for 98 percent of total sugar output in Uganda.  
 Production for the whole of 2010 is forecast at 313,240
tons, compared with 282,386 tons last year, Mubiru said.  
 The three plants “always produce more sugar in the second
half of the year,” he said. “We believe the weather up to
December will be favorable for sugar production, and besides all
sugar companies have expanded their areas under cane.”  
 Kakira, Sugar Corp. and Kinyara Sugar Works Ltd., the
second-biggest producer, are investing a combined $100 million
to boost capacity and increase power generation in Uganda, the
association said in 2008. Kinyara is 51 percent-owned by Rai
Group, a Kenyan and Mauritius-based agro-forest company.  
 The three factories aim to increase their combined output
to 335,000 tons a year by 2011, it said.
