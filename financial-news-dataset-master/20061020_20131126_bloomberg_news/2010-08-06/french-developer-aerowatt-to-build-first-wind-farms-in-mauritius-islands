                  Aug. 6 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- French wind and
solar energy producer Aerowatt is developing 40 megawatts of
wind-farm projects in Mauritius, the island-nation’s first.  
 An 18-megawatt project near the village of Plaine des
Roches in northeast Mauritius will reach completion first. The
wind farm is being constructed for about 14 million euros ($18.4
million), Olivier Gaering, Aerowatt’s International Development
chief, said in a telephone interview.  
 “We’re in the process of negotiating a power purchase
agreement with Mauritius’s central electricity board and expect
this to be finalized in the third quarter,” he said.
Construction is set to begin in early 2011 and be complete
within a year, he said.  
 Aerowatt announced on July 7 that it had sold 210,000
carbon credits generated from the project to the Swedish
government. Gaering says the sale of the credits will help
finance the wind farm.  
 The second project will be near Britannia, 25 kilometers
(16 miles) south of the capital Port Louis. The 22-megawatt wind
farm is being developed in collaboration with the Mauritian
sugarcane and ethanol producer  Omnicane Limited . The project is
“close to finalization” and should reach completion in early
2012, Gaering said.  
 In addition to the Mauritian portfolio, Gaering said
Aerowatt is also developing projects in other African countries
including Morocco and Senegal.
