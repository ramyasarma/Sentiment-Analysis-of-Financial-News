             The euro and pound weakened against
the dollar after German and British data showed declining
industrial output and investors anticipated a report that may
indicate the U.S. job market is recovering.  
 The  Dollar Index  rose, paring a weekly drop that’s set to
be a ninth straight decline. Today’s non-farm payrolls report
may show the U.S. lost jobs for a second month as temporary
census staff were let go, while private payrolls that exclude
government agencies grew. The yen slid against all but one of
its major counterparts as gains in stocks damped demand for
Japan’s currency as a refuge.  
 “There isn’t really that much between Europe and the U.S.,
and that may limit the chance for euro gains,” said  Steven Barrow , head of research for Group of 10 countries at Standard
Bank Plc in London, referring to the pace of economic expansion
on both sides of the Atlantic. “Maybe the market is running
into the payrolls number a little bit short of dollars.”  
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3166 as of 11:48 a.m. in
London from $1.3189 in New York yesterday. The pound fell 0.2
percent to $1.5868. The yen was little changed at 113.22 per
euro, and Japan’s currency fell to 86.02 per dollar from 85.82.  
 The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six trading
partners, was 0.1 percent stronger at 80.908, headed for a 0.8
percent drop on the week. The run of nine weekly  losses  would be
the longest since Dec. 3, 2004.  
 Production in Germany fell 0.6 percent from May, when it
rose a revised 2.9 percent, the ministry said. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had forecast a gain of 0.5 percent.  
 U.K. industrial production, which includes utilities,
mining and quarrying and accounts for 17 percent of the economy,
declined 0.5 percent in June from the previous month, the Office
for National Statistics said today. Economists predicted a 0.1
percent gain.
