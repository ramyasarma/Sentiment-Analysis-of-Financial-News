             Fitch Ratings will start its national
ratings scale in Kenya to help develop the country’s domestic
corporate debt market, it said.  
 “Fitch’s decision to introduce the national ratings scale
in Kenya is driven by the development of the domestic corporate
debt capital market and by the demand for this product from the
issuers and investors,” Tertius Smith, managing director and
head of Fitch’s office in Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed
statement today.
