             American International Group Inc.  said
it may sell all of its stake in its consumer lending unit,
American General Finance Corp.  
 “AIG is continuing to explore strategic alternatives for
AGF, including a potential sale of all or a majority of its $2.4
billion investment in AGF,” the New York-based company said
today in reporting a second-quarter loss of $2.66 billion.  
 AIG said it intends to provide support through February
2011 to its plane leasing and consumer-lending units, the same
date it gave in a May regulatory filing. The company said the
support may not be necessary. Its May filing was the first time
in four quarters that AIG didn’t extend the period in which it
was committed to helping the businesses.  
 ILFC and American General regained access to outside
funding after being shut out of credit markets following
downgrades of AIG. American General borrowed $3 billion through
a secured term-loan facility in April, and ILFC raised capital
in unsecured debt markets for the first time in two years in
March.  
 Credit-default swaps used to hedge against losses on ILFC
debt were trading at 531 basis points yesterday, compared with
387 at the end of the first quarter. The swaps typically climb
when investor confidence wanes. Contracts for American General
were at 610 yesterday, compared with 510 on March 31.
