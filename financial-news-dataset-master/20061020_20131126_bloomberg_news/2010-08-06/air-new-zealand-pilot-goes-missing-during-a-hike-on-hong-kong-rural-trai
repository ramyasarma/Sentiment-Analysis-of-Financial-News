             An  Air New Zealand  pilot went missing
while hiking in a rural area of Hong Kong, and rescue workers
are searching for him, the company and police said today.  
 Deputy pilot Steve Morrissey was out on a trail Aug. 4 with
pilot Mark Apperley, Air New Zealand Deputy Chief Executive  Norm Thompson  said in a statement. Morrissey failed to arrive at a
meeting point the two had agreed upon after Apperley stopped to
rest, the statement said.  
 Morrissey did not report for duty later for the carrier’s
flight NZ39 from Hong Kong to London, the statement said.  
 Hong Kong police began searching for Morrissey along the
trail in the rural New Territories last night, and more than 50
rescue workers have joined the effort, the statement said.
Morrissey is 51, according to a separate statement from Hong
Kong police.  
 “We are working with the Hong Kong authorities and Air New
Zealand to assist with the ongoing search for Steven
Morrissey,” said Chris Wilson, spokesman of the ministry of
foreign affairs and trade of New Zealand. “We are currently
offering consular assistance to his family.”
