             Alitalia SpA doesn’t need to sell
stock and if necessary the airline can borrow from banks because
it has repaid debt on its carriers earlier than planned, Chief
Executive Officer Rocco Sabelli told daily La Repubblica in an
interview.  
 Crude oil will cost the company about 100 million euros
($132 million) more this year, Sabelli told the Italian
newspaper. The company aims to break even by the end of 2011,
based on a forecast of crude oil prices at $85 a barrel and an
exchange rate of $1.30 against the euro, he said in the report.
