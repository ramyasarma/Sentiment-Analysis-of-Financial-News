             England leads Pakistan by 40 runs
after bad light ended play on the opening day of their second
cricket Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham.  
 An unbeaten 68-run partnership between Kevin Pietersen and
Jonathan Trott helped England reach 112-2 after Pakistan had
been bowled out for 72. Pietersen has 36 runs and Trott is on
31.  
 Pakistan elected to bat after winning the toss. James
Anderson and Stuart Broad took four wickets each as the visitor
recorded its lowest score against England, surpassing the
previous mark of 80 it got in losing the first Test at Trent
Bridge.
