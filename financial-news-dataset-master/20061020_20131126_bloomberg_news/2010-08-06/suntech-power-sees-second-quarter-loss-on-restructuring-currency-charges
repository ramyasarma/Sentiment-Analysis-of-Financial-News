             Suntech Power Holdings Co. , China’s
largest maker of solar-power modules, said restructuring and
currency charges will result in a net loss of up to $1 a share
for the second quarter.  
 The loss will be in the range of $147 million to $179
million, Suntech, based in China’s Jiangsu province, said today
in a statement. The company a year ago reported net income of
$9.97 million. Suntech was expected to earn 7 cents a share, the
average of 16 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg .  Sales  may
almost double to $630 million from $321 million.  
 Most of the loss comes from shutting its Shanghai-based
amorphous silicon thin-film factory and impairment charges
related to its investment in silicon manufacturer Shunda
Holdings Ltd. The 6 percent decline in the euro against the U.S.
dollar resulted in a currency exchange loss of $35 million.  
 Suntech dropped 24 cents , or 2.4 percent, to $9.80 as of
9:20 a.m. in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Before today, the shares had declined 40 percent this year.  
 Suntech plans to release complete second quarter results on
Aug. 18 before the start of U.S. trading.
