             NewPage Corp.,  the coated-paper maker
owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP, has a “very thin”
liquidity cushion and “2011 may prove fatal,” debt-research
firm CreditSights Inc. said in a report.  
 NewPage’s  debt  tumbled by the most in almost six months
yesterday after the Miamisburg, Ohio-based company reported a
$174 million second-quarter loss even as sales increased.
Chairman  Robert Nardelli  said NewPage is “focusing on specific
cost initiatives” after posting the loss, which widened 29-fold
from a year ago. The company said it had $7 million of cash and
$113 million available on its credit line.  
 Next year “could prove to be fatal if current positive
operating momentum on the volume front faces economy-related
hiccups,” analysts  Rahul Gandhi  and  Chris Ucko  of New York-
based CreditSights said yesterday.  
 “Based on our projections, we are comfortable with the
year-end” liquidity level without any asset sales, said  Amber Garwood , a NewPage spokeswoman. Gandhi declined to comment
beyond the report.  
 NewPage’s $1.7 billion of 11.375 percent senior secured
notes due in 2014 fell 0.5 cent to 87.75 cents on the dollar as
of 2:37 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The debt fell 3.5 cents yesterday, the biggest decline since
Feb. 8, amid the securities’ busiest day of trading on record,
Trace data show.  
 The company’s $783 million of 10 percent notes due in 2012
fell 8.25 cents to 47.75 cents yesterday and have declined from
87 cents in January, Trace data show.  
 Cerberus acquired NewPage for $2.52 billion in December
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
