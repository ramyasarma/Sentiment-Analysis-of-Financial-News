             Apple Inc.  will comply with a
government order and provide information to Japanese consumers
on how to avoid the potential risk of some iPod Nano music
players catching fire.  
 The information, which focuses on obtaining and replacing
the battery on first-generation iPod Nanos, will be posted in a
prominent place on the company’s Japanese website in the next
few days,  Tom Neumayr , an Apple spokesman, said today by
telephone. The posting complies with the Japanese government’s
demand for a consumer alert about the fire risk, Neumayr said.  
 The world’s  most-valuable  technology company is responding
to instructions from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry. The ministry yesterday advised Apple’s Japanese unit
to post the information, including a list of serial numbers of
affected products, on the website and to e-mail it to consumers.
The government asked Apple to report on its progress by Aug. 13.  
 “IPods are incredibly well designed and safety is the
highest priority for Apple,” Neumayr said. “We’ve worked
closely with METI to make sure first-generation iPod Nano
customers who are concerned with their battery have the latest
information.”  
 Six incidents have been reported to the Japanese government
since 2008 in which the 2005-model device caught fire while
being recharged, ministry spokesman Hiroshi Miyashita said last
week.  
 Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fell $2.75, or 1.1
percent, to $258.95 at 12:49 New York time on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. The shares had risen 24 percent this year before today.
