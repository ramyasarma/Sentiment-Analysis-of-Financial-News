             Wheat in South Africa, the fourth-
largest producer of the grain on the continent, rose by the
daily limit after Russia banned grain exports.  
 Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Kazakhstan
and Belarus should also suspend shipments.  
 “It’s definitely the Russian move,” Piet Faure, a trader
at CJS Securities Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg today.  
 Wheat for September delivery jumped 100 rand, or 3.7
percent, to 2,818 rand ($389) a metric ton on the South African
Futures Exchange as of 9:26 a.m. local time. Egypt, Morocco and
Algeria are the largest African wheat producers.  
 White corn for December delivery gained 13 rand, or 1.1
percent, to 1,218 rand a ton. Meal made from the grain is South
Africa’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for September delivery rose 8 rand, or 0.7
percent, to 1,205 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly for
animal feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are among
the world’s largest exporters of the grain.  
 Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:
