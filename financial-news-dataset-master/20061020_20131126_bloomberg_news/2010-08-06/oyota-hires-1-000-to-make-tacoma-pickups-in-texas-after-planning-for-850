             Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
largest automaker, added 1,000 workers to build Tacoma pickups
at its San Antonio truck plant and is using the factory’s full
capacity for the first time after a rocky start.  
 The company yesterday marked the start of compact Tacoma
production in the plant built to make only larger Tundra pickups
when it opened in late 2006. Lower demand for Tundras than
Toyota expected and the closing of its former California joint-
venture plant this year led it to move Tacoma output to Texas at
a cost of $100 million.  
 “No one forecast the overall collapse of the U.S. market
in 2008, and certainly we didn’t anticipate full-size trucks
would fall as much as they did,”  Jim Lentz , Toyota’s U.S. sales
chief, told reporters yesterday at the factory. The company’s
current 270,000-unit North American pickup run rate, including
50,000 Tacomas built in Mexico, “looks about right,” he said.  
 Toyota planned to sell at least 200,000 Tundras a year when
it began building the truck in 2006 in both Texas and Indiana.
Sales missed that target in the model’s first full year, and
U.S. volume shrank in subsequent years as fuel prices rose to a
record in 2008 and later as the recession curbed demand.  
 The addition of Tacoma raised investment in the Texas plant
to $1.4 billion,  Atsushi Niimi , executive vice president for
global manufacturing, said yesterday in an interview in San
Antonio. It may take a decade to recoup that investment,
compared with seven years for most Toyota plants, he said.  
 Tough Competition  
 U.S. sales of full-size pickups, dominated by trucks from
 Ford Motor Co.  and General Motors Co., may total 1.4 million to
1.5 million this year, Lentz said. Tundra sales through July
rose 29 percent to 54,515.  
 The Toyota City, Japan-based company sold 79,385 Tundras in
the U.S. last year, down from 196,555 in 2007, the first full
year after it was redesigned to compete with models from Ford
and GM. Toyota’s U.S. sales unit is based in Torrance,
California.  
 Toyota’s  American depositary receipts , each equal to two
ordinary shares, rose 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $72.52
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They
have declined 13.8 percent this year.  
 Lentz said he doesn’t expect the San Antonio plant to be
enlarged anytime soon. Toyota had said in October that it would
hire 850 for the additional work. The number increased after
Toyota discovered Tacoma assembly required more manpower than
planned, said  Dan Antis , plant manager.  
 Plant Utilization  
 San Antonio is building trucks at a rate that would allow
the plant to make a combined 220,000 Tundras and Tacomas
annually, Antis said. Official capacity for the factory remains
200,000 trucks a year, said  Tania Saldana , a Toyota spokeswoman.  
 Toyota now employees 2,800 people at the factory. About
2,500 more work there for suppliers located on site, Antis said.  
 Higher production in Texas, and increases at other Toyota
plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will boost the company’s
plant utilization in the region to 90 percent this year,  Steve St. Angelo , chief quality officer and executive vice president
for North America manufacturing, said this week at an automotive
conference in Acme, Michigan.  
 Overall use of existing Toyota production lines in North
America should rise to 100 percent in 2011, St. Angelo said.  
 The recession that began in 2008 and falling auto sales in
2009 cut Toyota’s plant-utilization rate to about 70 percent for
much of 2009. Production at San Antonio stopped for three months
in 2008, before the factory reopened late that year.
