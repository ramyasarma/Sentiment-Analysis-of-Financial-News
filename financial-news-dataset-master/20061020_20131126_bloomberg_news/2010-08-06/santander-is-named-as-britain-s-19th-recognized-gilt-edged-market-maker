             Santander Global Banking & Markets
was named a recognized gilt-edged market maker by the U.K. Debt
Management Office and London Stock Exchange, enabling the arm of
 Banco Santander SA  to participate in government bond auctions.  
 “We are delighted that we now have GEMM status so we are
able to offer clients a full complementary product range,” Luis
Sousa, head of the U.K. division of the Spanish-based investment
bank, said in an e-mailed press release. “Sterling is a major
part of Santander’s global strategy and this now reinforces our
commitment to meeting clients’ needs here in the U.K. and
globally.”  
 The appointment, due to take effect from Aug. 19, brings
the number of gilt-edged market makers to 19, including Societe
Generale SA, whose status was announced by the debt management
office on Aug. 2.  
 So-called GEMMs, or primary dealers, are expected to
maintain a certain share of both regular gilts and index-linked
securities on a three-month rolling basis, according to the Debt
Management Office.
