             German stocks retreated from a two-
year high after a bigger-than-estimated decrease in jobs in the
U.S. added to evidence the economic recovery is slowing.  
 HeidelbergCement AG led declines on the benchmark DAX
Index, falling 3.8 percent. E.ON AG and RWE AG, Germany’s
biggest utilities, dropped at least 1 percent as UBS AG
downgraded its rating on the industry. Fertilizer producer  K+S
AG  gained after wheat reached its highest price in almost two
years following an export ban by Russia.  
 The  DAX  fell 1.2 percent to 6,259.63 at the 5:30 p.m. close
of trading in Frankfurt, paring this week’s increase to 1.8
percent. The measure rallied 3.1 percent in July, its biggest
increase since March, as demand at bond auctions in Greece,
Spain and Portugal eased concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis will derail the economic recovery. The broader  HDAX Index 
slid 1.1 percent today.  
 Stocks erased earlier gains after the U.S. Labor Department
said private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose by
71,000, less than forecast, after a gain of 31,000 in June that
was smaller than previously reported. Economists projected a
90,000 rise in private jobs, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey. Overall employment fell 131,000 and the
jobless rate held at 9.5 percent, the report said.  
 Cut to Hold  
 HeidelbergCement , the world’s largest maker of aggregates
used to produce concrete and asphalt, tumbled 3.8 percent to
38.09 euros. The stock was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 E.ON slid 2 percent to 23.06 euros and RWE slipped 1
percent to 55.26 euros. UBS analysts  Nick Nelson  and  Karen Olney 
cut their rating on utility shares to “neutral” from
“overweight,” saying profit growth will be slower than any other
industry in 2011 as companies such face new taxes on nuclear
fuel and hydropower.  
 K+S , Europe’s biggest producer of potash, climbed 1.4
percent to 44.11 euros after wheat prices surged. Russia, the
world’s third-biggest grower of wheat, banned exports of the
grain from Aug. 15 to Dec. 31, as the country’s worst drought in
half a century cut yields.  
 Lanxess AG  rallied 3.6 percent to 40.14 euros. Germany’s
largest publicly traded specialty chemicals maker raised its
2010 forecast for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization to 800 million euros ($1.06 billion) from a
previous prediction of 650 million euros to 700 million euros.  
 Kinghero AG , the China-focused fashion company which traded
in Frankfurt for the first time today, rose 0.7 percent to 15.10
euros. The Munich-based company said yesterday it had placed 15
million shares at 15 euros each.
