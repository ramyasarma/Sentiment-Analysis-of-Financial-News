             India may raise as much as 150
billion rupees ($3.3 billion) from the sale of shares in Coal
India Ltd. in what would be the nation’s largest initial public
offering, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  
 The world’s biggest producer of coal will file its draft
sale prospectus with India’s capital markets regulator early
next week, and plans to sell shares around mid-October, the
people said, declining to be named before a public announcement.  
 The IPO, likely to surpass the 116 billion rupees raised by
billionaire  Anil Ambani ’s  Reliance Power Ltd.  in January 2008,
would bring Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  closer to his target
of raising a record 400 billion rupees from asset sales in the
year to March 31. The cabinet in June approved the government’s
plans to sell a 10 percent stake in Kolkata-based Coal India.  
 Bank of America Corp.,  Citigroup Inc. , Deutsche Bank AG,
Enam Securities Pvt., Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. and Morgan
Stanley were selected to manage the IPO, two bankers with
knowledge of the matter said in May.  
 Partha Bhattacharyya , chairman of Coal India, couldn’t
immediately be reached on his mobile phone. Spokespeople at the
banks didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment.  
 Coal India may offer the shares to investors from Oct. 18
to Oct. 21, the Press Trust of India reported yesterday, citing
Bhattacharyya. The company may raise about 150 billion rupees,
the news agency had reported July 26.  
 Individual investors and employees will get a 5 percent
discount, the people said.
