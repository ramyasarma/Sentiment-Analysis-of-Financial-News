             Asian demand for sugar was “very
strong” amid reduced estimates for Thai production and shipping
delays in Brazil, Queensland Sugar Ltd. said in an e-mailed
statement today.  
 “Refiners in Asia will need to import around 3.5 million
metric tons in the next six months, which will be hard to get
while sugar remains caught up in the shipping delays in
Brazil,” Queensland Sugar Chief Executive Officer Neil Taylor
said in a statement. The company ships more than 90 percent of
Australia’s raw sugar.
