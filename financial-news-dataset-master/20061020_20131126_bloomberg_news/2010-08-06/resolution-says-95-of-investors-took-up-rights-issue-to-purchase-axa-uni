             Resolution Ltd. , the buyout firm
founded by  Clive Cowdery , said 95.5 percent of shareholders took
up their rights in a share sale that will fund the purchase of
Axa SA’s U.K. life-insurance unit.  
 The new stock issued in the 2.06 billion-pound
($3.28 billion) share sale will begin trading on the London
Stock Exchange today at 8 a.m., the Guernsey, Channel Islands-
based firm said in a statement.  
 Resolution will be halfway through its plan to buy and
merge as many as four U.K. life insurers by 2013 once the deal
is completed. The insurer plans to pay 2.75 billion pounds for
the Axa division after acquiring Friends Provident Plc for
1.9 billion pounds last year.  
 RBC Capital Markets and Barclays Capital, which underwrote
the share sale, are looking for subscribers to purchase the
remaining shares, Resolution said.
