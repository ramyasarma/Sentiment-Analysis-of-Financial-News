             U.S. farmers will reap more corn than
ever after planting rose, while soybean production will drop
because excessive rain in July stunted crop growth, according to
a survey of Midwest fields by  Doane Advisory Services Co .  
 Corn output in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
exporter, will rise to 13.178 billion bushels from 13.11 billion
bushels last year, St. Louis-based Doane said today in a report.
The forecast was based on samples in five states from July 25 to
July 30. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last month the
crop would be 13.245 billion bushels.  
 “The production estimate is up very slightly from 2009,
but falls short of projected demand at 13.5 to 13.6 billion
bushels,” Doane said in a report.  
 Soybean production in the U.S., the largest grower and
exporter, will be 3.35 billion bushels, down from a record 3.359
billion in 2009, Doane said. The government estimated the crop
at 3.345 billion last month.  
 “August weather developments often have a major impact on
yield potential, and it is common for the final U.S. yield to
vary from August by 2 bushels per acre,” Doane said in the
report.  
 The Agriculture Department is scheduled to update its crop
estimates on Aug. 12.
