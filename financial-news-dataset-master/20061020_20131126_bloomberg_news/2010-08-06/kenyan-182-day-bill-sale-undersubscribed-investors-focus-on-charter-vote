             Kenya sold the smallest amount of
182-day Treasury bills since June at an auction that was
undersubscribed because investors were awaiting the result of a
referendum on a new constitution, the central bank said.  
 Kenya  sold  3.65 billion shillings ($46 million) of bills at
the auction and had offered 6 billion shillings, the  Central
Bank of Kenya  said yesterday in an e-mailed statement from
Nairobi, the capital. That’s the smallest amount since June 24
when it sold 3.16 billion shillings, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 The cut-off interest rate was unchanged from the previous
auction at 1.999 percent, the central bank said. The rate on the
bills reached 1.8 percent in the July 8 auction, the lowest
since at least March 2006 when Bloomberg began regular record-
keeping of the auction results.  
 Bidding fell short because “people were busy with the
referendum,” Jackson Kitili, director of monetary operations
and debt management, said by phone from Nairobi today.  
 Sterling Investment Bank  said most investors “stayed out
of the market as they awaited the outcome of the referendum,”
according to an e-mailed research note dated today.  
 Kenyans approved a new constitution in the Aug. 4
referendum, with the backing of about 67.3 percent of the 8
million people who cast votes, the final tally by the country’s
 Interim Independent Electoral Commission  showed late yesterday.  
 The charter aims to spread political power among dozens of
ethnic groups and end quarrels over land distribution. Those
issues were at the heart of violence that broke out in 2008
following a disputed presidential election, leaving as many as
1,500 people dead and driving 300,000 from their homes.  
 The bank will offer 5 billion shillings of 364-day
securities at an Aug. 11 auction, and 4 billion shillings of 91-
day bills at a sale on Aug. 12, it said.
