             Japan’s broadest indicator of
 economic health  was little changed in June, a sign slower demand
is tempering a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.  
 The  coincident index , a composite of 11 indicators
including factory production and  retail sales , rose to 101.3
from 101.2 in the previous month, the Cabinet Office said today
in Tokyo. That compared with a median estimate of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for 101.2.  
 The report adds to evidence that Japan’s  economy  is cooling
as production slows and the impact of stimulus measures fades.
Yields for benchmark 10-year government bonds dropped to the
lowest in seven years this week and the yen strengthened to an
eight-month high as investors sought safer investments amid
uncertainty over the global economic outlook.  
 “It’s clear that Japan’s economy is going to slow,”
 Yoshiki Shinke , senior economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research
Institute in Tokyo, said before the report.  
 The  leading index , a composite of 12 indicators including
stock prices and consumer confidence, rose to 98.9 in June,
today’s report showed.  
 Production  unexpectedly dropped from a month earlier in
June and the  jobless rate  rose to 5.3 percent. Consumer prices
fell for a 16th month, adding to evidence of persisting
deflation, government reports showed last week.
