             Morgan Stanley hired former JPMorgan
Chase & Co. analyst  Francesca Tondi  to join its equity research
team covering Italian and German banks in London.  
 Francesca will start in mid-October as managing director,
said  Sebastian Howell , a spokesman for Morgan Stanley in London.
Her responsibilities won’t include Deutsche Bank AG, which is
covered by  Huw van Steenis .  
 Tondi resigned in July after more than 10 years at
JPMorgan, where she covered lenders including  UniCredit SpA ,
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA,  Commerzbank AG , Deutsche Postbank AG and
Aareal Bank AG.  
 Before JPMorgan, Tondi worked for Fitch Ratings as a
banking analyst, starting in 1998, and for KPMG’s financial
business division, starting in 1995. A native of Italy, Tondi
has a bachelor’s degree in economics from Bocconi University in
Milan.  
 Morgan Stanley also hired  Henrik Schmidt  as executive
director to cover Nordic banks in mid-July to reinforce the
research team, said Howell on the phone.
