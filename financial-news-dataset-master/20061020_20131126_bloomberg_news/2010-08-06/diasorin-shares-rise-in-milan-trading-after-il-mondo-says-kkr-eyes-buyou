             Diasorin SpA shares jumped the most
in five months in Milan trading after weekly magazine Il Mondo
said U.S. private equity firm  KKR & Co.  is considering a buyout
of the Italian supplier of diagnostic tests.  
 Diasorin  shares  rose 1.40 euros, or 4.7 percent to 31.43
euros at 10:20 a.m. in Milan trading. The stock gained as much
as 7.4 percent, the biggest intraday advance since March 10.
Diasorin has risen 26 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 1.73 billion euros ($2.28 billion).  
 The buyout is likely to involve Chief Executive Officer
Carlo Rosa, the magazine said, without saying how it obtained
the information. The U.S. firm may decide by September whether
to go ahead with a bid, Il Mondo said. A spokesman for KKR in
London declined to comment. An outside spokeswoman for Diasorin
didn’t have an immediate comment.  
 The Saluggia, Italy-based company’s 2009  net income  almost
doubled to 70 million euros on sales of 304 million euros. The
supplier of reagent kits for in vitro diagnostics is boosting
revenue in the U.S., helped by sales of tests to monitor Vitamin
D levels and infectious diseases.  
 Diasorin, 44 percent  owned  by IP Investimenti
Partecipazioni of the Denegri family, is scheduled to report
first-half results today. CEO Rosa owns an 8.7 percent stake,
according to market regulator Consob’s website.
