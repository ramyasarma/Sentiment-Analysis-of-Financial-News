             Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. was probably spared in the Congressional overhaul of
financial regulations from having to post more collateral on
derivatives contracts, the company said.  
 “We do not believe that the provisions of the Reform Act
that concern collateral requirements apply to derivatives
contracts that were entered into prior to the enactment of the
Reform Act, as ours were,” Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said
today in its quarterly report to regulators. “Although the
Reform Act may affect some of our business activities, it is not
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
results or financial condition.”
