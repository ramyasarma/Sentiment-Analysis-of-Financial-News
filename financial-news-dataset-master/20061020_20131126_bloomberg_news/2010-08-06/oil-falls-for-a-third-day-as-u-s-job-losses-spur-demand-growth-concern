             Crude oil fell for a third day as
weaker-than-forecast growth in U.S. company payrolls bolstered
concern that economic growth in the world’s biggest oil-
consuming country is slowing.  
 Oil slipped 1.6 percent after the Labor Department said
private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose by
71,000, less than forecast, after a gain of 31,000 in June that
was smaller than previously reported. A report on Aug. 4 showed
that U.S. fuel supplies increased last week as demand dropped.  
 “The fundamental news today is that the U.S. economy isn’t
creating enough jobs,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “There’s no indication
that this situation will change anytime soon. There were already
doubts about demand, and inventories remain elevated.”  
 Crude oil for September delivery fell $1.31 to settle at
$80.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
decline since July 27. Futures rose 2.2 percent this week.  
 Brent crude oil for September settlement declined $1.45, or
1.8 percent, to end the session at $80.16 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 Economists projected a 90,000 rise in private jobs,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Overall employment fell 131,000 and the jobless rate held at 9.5
percent, according to the department.  
 “We’re losing jobs, not adding them,” said  Michael Fitzpatrick , vice president of energy at  MF  Global in New York.
“This is hardly a signal that energy demand will be vibrant in
coming months.”  
 Revised Employment Data  
 Total employment fell a revised 221,000 in June, today’s
figures showed. Payroll estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 84
economists ranged from a decline of 160,000 to a gain of 10,000
after a previously reported loss of 125,000 jobs in June that
was led by census dismissals.  
 “There was a significant downward revision in the June
jobs number and a decline in total jobs last month,” said  Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-
based energy consultant. “It’s clear that the U.S. road to
recovery will be long.”  
 Equities also declined on the employment numbers. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.4 percent to 1,121.64, and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 percent to
10,653.56.  
 Fuel Demand  
 U.S.  fuel consumption  dropped 2.5 percent to 19.3 million
barrels a day last week, according to an Energy Department
report on Aug. 4.  
 Gasoline  supplies  increased 729,000 barrels, or 0.3
percent, to 223 million, the highest level since April 30.
Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, rose 2.17 million barrels to 169.7 million, the
highest level since the week ended Oct. 16.  
 Increasing fuel supplies are helping narrow the margin, or
 crack spread , for processing three barrels of oil into two of
gasoline and one of heating oil by 6.9 percent to $8.576 a
barrel, based on New York futures prices. It’s the lowest margin
since February and the biggest drop since June 23.  
 Gasoline for September delivery fell 5.17 cents, or 2.4
percent, to settle at $2.1127 a gallon in New York, the biggest
decline since July 1. Heating oil for September settlement
dropped 3.96 cents, or 1.8 percent, to end the session at
$2.1472 a gallon.  
 The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 16 raw materials fell
1.1 percent to 274.71 at 3:21 p.m., the biggest drop since June
29.  
 ‘Quite Entrenched’  
 “I don’t see a lot of upside in oil right now, oil’s quite
entrenched,”  Francisco Blanch,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
head of commodities research, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s InsideTrack program in New York today. “Oil being
between $75 and $85 is probably OK for the economy. If it
overshoots maybe $15, $20, it’s going to be a bad story.”  
 Chinese demand growth for oil products may slow to 4
percent in the second half of the year from 14 percent in the
first as the world’s fastest-growing major economy cools, Gong
Manying, market research director at PetroChina Co.’s planning
and engineering institute, said by telephone from Beijing today.  
 The U.S. and China, the world’s biggest energy-consuming
countries, accounted for 32 percent of global oil demand in
2009, according to  BP Plc , which publishes its BP Statistical
Review of World Energy each June.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 648,053 contracts as of 3:26
p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 468,871 contracts yesterday, 31
percent below the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.26 million contracts.
