             European  stocks dropped, trimming
this week’s rally in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, after a
government report showed the U.S. lost more jobs last month than
economists had forecast.  
 Banco Santander SA and Nestle SA led declines on the
benchmark  Stoxx 600 . Anheuser-Busch InBev NV paced brewing
companies lower as wheat traded close to the highest level in
almost two years. Dexia SA tumbled 4.7 percent after reporting a
decline in earnings.  
 The Stoxx 600 lost 1.1 percent to 258.71 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, paring its weekly rally to 1.3 percent, as all
19 industry groups fell. Stocks advanced this week as better-
than-estimated results from companies such as HSBC Holdings Plc
and BNP Paribas SA boosted optimism that the economy will
continue to grow.  
 “The data’s pointing to the recovery being very slow and
protracted,” said  Gregor Smith , a fund manager at Daiwa Asset
Management in London, who helps oversee about $1 billion. “It’s
a bit of a surprise it’s as weak as it was. It’s going to feel
pretty painful.”  
 Overall employment in the U.S. fell 131,000, missing the
average forecast for a decline of 65,000, while  unemployment 
held at 9.5 percent, Labor Department figures in Washington
showed today.  
 Private Payrolls  
 Companies added workers in July for a seventh straight
month at a pace that suggests the labor-market recovery will be
slow to take hold. Private payrolls that exclude government
agencies rose by 71,000 after a June gain of 31,000 that was
smaller than previously reported. Economists projected a 90,000
July increase, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  
 The U.S. economy has expanded for four straight quarters
after shrinking for five of the previous six as the collapse of
the subprime mortgage industry triggered the worst contraction
since the Great Depression. Growth slowed to 2.4 percent in the
first quarter from 3.7 percent at the end of 2009, spurring
concern the nation is at risk of entering another recession as
government stimulus programs expire.  
 National benchmark indexes dropped in all 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index retreated 0.6
percent, Germany’s DAX lost 1.2 percent and France’s CAC 40 fell
1.3 percent.  
 Santander declined 2.6 percent to 10.11 euros. Nestle
retreated 1 percent to 50.55 Swiss francs.  
 Wheat Prices  
 Food and beverage stocks were the biggest decliners on the
Stoxx 600 as wheat prices traded close to a two-year high amid
concern that other nations may follow Russia’s export ban.
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, sank 3.9
percent to 39.19 euros.  Heineken NV  lost 3.5 percent to 33.93
euros and Carlsberg AS slumped 5.1 percent to 489 euros.  
  Dexia , which received billions of euros in capital and
funding guarantees from France, Belgium and Luxembourg during
the credit crunch, said second-quarter profit dropped 12
percent, hurt by a loss at its Slovak unit and lower revenue.
The shares lost 4.7 percent to 3.78 euros.  
 Lonmin Plc sank 5.1 percent to 1,557 pence. South Africa’s
government ordered the company to halt sales of non-platinum-
group metals. Lonmin said it would seek an urgent court ruling
to overturn the order.  
 Beaten Estimates  
 About 55 percent of Stoxx 600 members that have posted
results since July 12 have beaten analysts’ estimates for net
income, according to  data compiled  by Bloomberg. That compares
with 66 percent of S&P 500 companies during the same period, the
data show.  
 Umicore SA climbed 3.4 percent to 28.73 euros. Full-year
profit before interest, tax and one-time items will increase to
a range of 315 million euros ($415 million) to 335 million
euros, up from a previous forecast of 260 million euros to 290
million euros, the company said.  
 Natixis SA  advanced 2.8 percent to 4.41 euros. The
investment-banking unit of France’s second-biggest bank by
branches had second-quarter net income of 522 million euros,
compared with a year-earlier loss of 819 million euros.  
 Logica Plc surged 6.1 percent to 116.1 pence, the highest
level since June and the biggest rally on the Stoxx 600 today.
The Anglo-Dutch computer-services provider said its interim
dividend will increase to 1.9 pence a share from 1 penny. This
was more than the 1.2 pence forecast increase by Panmure Gordon
& Co. analyst  George O’Connor , who said “Logica’s message is
that it is back to pre-the downturn.”  
 Syngenta AG climbed 3.1 percent to 250.9 pence. Citigroup
Inc. upgraded  Syngenta  to “buy” from “hold,” citing a
recovery in grain prices and saying de-stocking in the
agricultural chain has ended. Yara International ASA gained 1.5
percent to 250 kroner.
