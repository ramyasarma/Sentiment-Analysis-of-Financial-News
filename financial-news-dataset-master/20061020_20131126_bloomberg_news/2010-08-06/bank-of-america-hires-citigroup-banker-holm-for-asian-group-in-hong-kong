             Bank of America Corp.  hired  Chad Holm , a Citigroup Inc. investment banker to financial companies
such as BlackRock Inc. and NYSE Euronext, to join its Asian
financial-institutions group in Hong Kong.  
 Holm, who was previously based in New York, will start Oct.
1,  Robert Stewart , a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, confirmed in an e-mail. Holm will report
to  Michael Tan , head of the financial-institutions group in Hong
Kong, and  Inkyo Shu , who has the same role in Japan.  
 Bank of America is adding dozens of senior bankers in Asia,
Europe and Latin America to expand from its home market after
buying Merrill Lynch & Co. in 2009. The bank said last month it
hired  Peter MacDonald , a former co-head of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.’s Asian securities unit, as a vice chairman for Asia-
Pacific.  
 Holm was part of the team that advised  BlackRock  on its
$15.2 billion purchase of Barclays Plc’s investment-management
business last year, and NYSE Group Inc.’s $14.3 billion
acquisition of Euronext NV in 2007, according to Corporate
Control Alert, an industry newsletter.  
 Holm joined New York-based Citigroup in 2005 after a
previous job at Lazard Ltd.
