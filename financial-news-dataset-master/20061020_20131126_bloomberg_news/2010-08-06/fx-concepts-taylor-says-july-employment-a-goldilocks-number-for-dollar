             John Taylor, who heads the world’s
largest hedge fund dedicated to currencies, said the July
employment report was a ‘Goldilocks’ number for the currency
market.   
 The dollar is likely to weaken for a few more weeks before
strengthening at the end of the year as the economy slows and
banks cut back on lending, reducing the supply of dollars in the
market, Taylor, the chairman of FX Concepts LLC in New York,
made the comments in a Bloomberg Television interview today.
