             The  Stoxx Nordic 30 Index , the
benchmark gauge for the region, declined 1 percent to 6,759.96.  
 The  OMX Stockholm 30 Index  fell 0.9 percent and the  OMX
Helsinki 25 Index  slipped 0.8 percent. Norway’s  OBX Index  was
little changed, falling less than 0.1 percent to 343.11, while
the  OMX Copenhagen 20 Index  declined 1.3 percent.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market.  
 Aker BioMarine ASA  (AKBM NO) soared 7.5 percent to 1.73
kroner, its third gain in four days. The Norwegian krill
harvester said its second-quarter net loss shrank to 15 million
kroner ($2.52 million) from 48 million kroner a year earlier.  
 Elektrobit Oyj  (EBC1V FH) fell 3.7 percent to 1.04 euros,
paring yesterday’s 5.9 percent gain. The Finnish research
provider for the automotive and wireless industries reported a
second-quarter net loss of 900,000 euros ($1.2 million).  
 Securitas AB  (SECUB SS) slipped 4.1 percent to 72.75
kronor, its biggest fall since May 25. The Swedish security-
services company said second-quarter net income rose to 471.3
million kronor ($66.6 million) from 467.6 million kronor a year
earlier. That missed the 478 million-krona estimate from nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
