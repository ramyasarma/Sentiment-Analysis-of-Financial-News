             The average home price in China’s
southern province of Hainan has fallen to 8,000 yuan per square
meter from 14,000 yuan, Xinhua News Agency said, citing Cai
Renjie, director of the provincial housing department.  
 Prices surged from 6,200 yuan per square meter last summer
after China’s central government announced plans to turn the
island province into a global tourist destination by 2020, the
official news agency said. The provincial government has drawn
up a medium-to-long-term plan for the real estate industry,
Xinhua said.
