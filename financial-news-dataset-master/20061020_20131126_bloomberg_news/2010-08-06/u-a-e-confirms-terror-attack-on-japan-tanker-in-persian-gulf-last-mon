             The Japanese oil tanker damaged in a
bomb attack July 28 in the Strait of Hormuz has left a port in
the United Arab Emirates after repairs, state-run  Emirates News
Agency  reported, citing an unidentified Coast Guard source.  
 The M. Star, which had docked about 14 miles (22
kilometers) offshore in the anchorage area at the  Port of
Fujairah , was the target of a terrorist attack, the news agency,
known as WAM, said today.  
 Explosives experts found a dent above the waterline of the
ship and traces of home-made explosives on the hull, WAM cited
the source as saying. The tanker may have been attacked by a
boat loaded with munitions, according to the report.  
 The ship’s owner  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.  is investigating
the cause of the explosion in the Strait, a chokepoint for oil
shipments out of the Persian Gulf. The company hasn’t had any
confirmation on the cause of the damage from the U.A.E., a
Mitsui spokeswoman said by telephone from Tokyo, declining to
say whether the ship had left port.  
 U.S. Navy divers assisting in the investigation examined
the ship’s hull to ascertain the cause of damage, Lt.  John Fage ,
a spokesman for the  Fifth Fleet  based in Bahrain, said
yesterday. U.S. military experts would continue to work with
U.A.E. officials in the investigation, he said today.  
 The Brigades of  Abdullah Azzam , a militant jihadist group,
said Aug. 4 that one of its members carried out a suicide bomb
attack on the tanker, according to  Site Intelligence Group , a
Maryland-based monitor of terrorism-related activities.
