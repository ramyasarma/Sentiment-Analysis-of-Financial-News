             Gold fluctuated in London amid
speculation demand will strengthen as China moves to relax
bullion-trading rules and the dollar slumps.  
 The metal is set for the first weekly climb since the five
days ended June 18. China, the world’s biggest gold producer and
second-largest buyer after India, said on Aug. 3 it would let
more banks import and export bullion and allow foreign companies
more access to trading. The dollar slipped to a three-month low
against the euro that day and is set for a second weekly drop.
Gold usually moves inversely to the greenback.  
 “The news that came out about China has definitely
supported the metal, because people think there could be more
demand,” said  Alexander Zumpfe , a precious-metals trader at
Hanau, Germany-based Heraeus Metallhandels GmbH. A slumping
dollar this week also “helps the metal,” he said.  
 Gold for immediate delivery lost 75 cents, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,194.20 an ounce at 11:49 a.m. in London. Prices swung
between a gain of 0.3 percent and a drop of 0.2 percent and are
up 1.1 percent this week. The metal for December delivery was
0.2 percent lower at $1,196.40 on the Comex in New York.  
 Bullion rose to $1,194.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,192.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Spot
prices reached a record $1,265.30 an ounce on June 21. The
dollar gained 0.2 percent against the euro today.  
 SPDR Holdings  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, added 0.91 metric ton to 1,282.75 tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. That’s the first
increase since July 12. Holdings on July 28 dropped 18.55 tons,
the most in more than two years.  
 “Despite some uneasiness about falling fund inflows, gold
is well-supported psychologically from the dollar’s weakness and
China’s relaxation of rules on gold trading,” said Park Hyun
Seon, a Seoul-based trader with Eugene Investment & Futures Co.
“Gold could retain strength, although it may face some selling
pressure after recent gains.”  
 Fourteen of 18 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 78 percent, said the metal will gain next week.
Two forecast lower prices and two were neutral.  
 Silver for immediate delivery in London added 0.1 percent
to $18.35 an ounce. Platinum lost 0.4 percent to $1,566.35 an
ounce. Palladium fell 1.8 percent to $488.13 an ounce.
