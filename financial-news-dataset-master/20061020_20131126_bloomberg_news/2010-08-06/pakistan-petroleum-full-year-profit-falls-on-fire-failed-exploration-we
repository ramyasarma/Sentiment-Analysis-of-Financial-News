             Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest producer of natural gas, posted a 16 percent decline in
annual profit after incurring expenses on a well fire and a
failed exploration well.  
 Net income in the year ended June 30 dropped to 23.3
billion rupees ($272 million), or 23.42 rupees a share, from
27.7 billion rupees, or 27.82 rupees, a year earlier, the
Karachi-based company said in a statement to the  stock exchange 
today. Revenue fell to 59.9 billion rupees from 61.6 billion
rupees.  
 The explorer spent 1.3 billion rupees on fighting a fire
and repairs at the Sui-38 well in September, according to Invest
Capital & Securities Ltd. in Karachi. Field exploration was
higher because of the Sui-38 well and the failed exploration
well at the Shark-1 well, said  Nauman Khan , a research analyst
at Invest Capital.  
 Pakistan Petroleum is expanding oil and gas exploration to
a record number of areas to help meet energy demand as the
government tries to bridge a shortage of fuels in the nation,
which imports 85 percent of the oil used domestically. Demand
for energy is three times supply and daily outages have forced
textile and engineering factories to close down and caused riots
across the country.  
 “Revenue fell as wellhead gas prices fell 15 percent
compared to last year,” said Khan, who recommends investors buy
the stock.  
 The company will incur an estimated 1 billion rupees in
costs after exploration at the Shark-1 offshore well in the
Indus Basin failed,  Khalid Rahman , chief executive officer, said
in an April 6 interview. The company’s field expenditure rose to
18.3 billion rupees in the year ended June 30, from 13.2 billion
rupees a year earlier, according to the statement.  
 Pakistan Petroleum shares rose 4.1 percent to 212.25 rupees
as of 2:56 p.m. on the  Karachi Stock Exchange . The stock has
gained 12 percent this year after more than doubling last year.
The company plans to pay a 50 percent cash dividend and 20
percent bonus shares.  
 The company is working on 36 blocks, of which it is the
main operator in 20, according to Rahman. That compares with an
average of 20 blocks earlier, in which the explorer was the main
operator in five or six, he said.
