             Bank of America Corp.  sued the
Italian city of Verona in a London court in at least its second
attempt to preempt potential legal action in Italy over
municipal derivatives.  
 Merrill Lynch managed a 257 million-euro ($338 million)
bond sale for the city in 2006, and adjusted payments on the 20-
year securities by using swaps. Verona is reviewing the
agreements, city finance director Pier Luigi Paloschi said by
telephone today. The city hasn’t been notified of a London claim
by the bank, he said.  
 Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd.
unit filed a claim at London’s high court on July 28, court
documents show. The bank is seeking to confirm that its
contracts with the municipal authority are valid and that it’s
met its obligations, according to a person familiar with the
claim who declined to be identified because the dispute is
private. An official at the lender in London declined to
comment.  
 Bank of America and UBS AG filed last month a similar claim
against the region of Lombardy, which was planning to sue the
banks in Italy over fees they charged on the derivatives. The
London claims may make it harder for the municipal authorities
to pursue cases in Italy, lawyers said.  
 Allegations of fraud in the sale of derivatives from Puglia,
on the heel of Italy, to Liguria, the region that borders France
along the Mediterranean, are prompting local governments to
review their arrangements, while lawmakers have proposed rules
that limit the use of swaps.
