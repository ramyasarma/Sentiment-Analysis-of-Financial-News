             Raw-sugar futures gained in New York
on speculation that Russia, the world’s third-biggest importer,
will boost purchases as the worst drought in at least half a
century threatens production.  
 Drought and record heat in central Russia and along the
Volga River forced the government to declare emergencies in 28
farm regions. Sugar beets are among crops being damaged, the
national weather center said this week. Russia, the world’s
third-biggest exporter of wheat in 2009, has banned grain
exports from Aug. 15 to Dec. 31.  
 “Russia’s imports should rise significantly,” said  Bruno Lima , a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group in Campinas,
Brazil. “This news should support the market.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery gained 0.08 cent, or 0.4
percent, to 18.37 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 10:21
a.m. in New York. The most-active contract climbed 22 percent
last month as importers increased purchases to replenish
stockpiles.  
 “The situation in Russia is worrying,” said  Jonathan Kingsman , a managing director of Kingsman SA, a sugar and
ethanol research company in Lausanne, Switzerland.  
 White, or refined, sugar futures for October delivery were
unchanged at $545.20 a metric ton on Liffe exchange in London,
after advancing as much as 1 percent.
