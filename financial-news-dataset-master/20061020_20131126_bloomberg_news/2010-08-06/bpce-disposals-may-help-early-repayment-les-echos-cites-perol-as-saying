             BPCE SA may pay off the remainder of
its 7 billion-euro ($9.2 billion) government loans before the
2013 deadline if it sells more assets, Les Echos reported,
citing Chairman  Francois Perol .  
 Proceeds from the 872 million-euro sale of Societe
Marseillaise de Credit to  BNP Paribas SA  have already put BPCE’s
repayments ahead of schedule, with 60 percent due to be paid off
by the end of October, the newspaper said.  
 While further disposals “could allow us to complete our
repayment schedule before 2013,” no asset sale is currently
being prepared or negotiated, Perol was quoted as saying in the
interview.
