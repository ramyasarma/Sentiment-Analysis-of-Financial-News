             Station Casinos Inc. , the biggest
U.S. gambling company in bankruptcy, won initial court
permission to sell most of its casinos to a group led by
Chairman  Frank Fertitta  in a deal worth $772 million.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Gregg Zive  today approved the results
of an auction process in which no other qualified bidder
challenged a group led by Fertitta and his brother, Vice
Chairman  Lorenzo Fertitta . Companies, including  Boyd Gaming
Corp. , declined to bid after Station announced a settlement with
bondholders last month.  
 “It’s a milestone, and a very important one,” Station
lawyer  Paul Aronzon  said of the settlement. Next week, the
company may settle with a group of dissident lenders, which
would end all creditor opposition to the Fertittas’ plan to
retain control of the gambling company, he said.  
 Station’s plan to reorganize and exit bankruptcy involves
breaking the Las Vegas-based company into two parts, both of
which would be taken over and reassembled by the Fertittas and
their partners, which include some company lenders.  
 The group is scheduled to return to court Aug. 27 in Reno,
Nevada, to seek final approval of the sale and the company’s
reorganization plan.  
 “We look forward to a new beginning for the company,”
Station Executive Vice President  Scott Nielson  said today in a
statement.  
 The case is In re Station Casinos Inc., 09-52477, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Reno).
