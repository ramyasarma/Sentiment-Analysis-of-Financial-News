             American International Group Inc. ,
the insurer rescued by the U.S., said second-quarter operating
profit rose 17 percent, fueled by U.S. life insurance results.  
 Net adjusted income  of $1.34 billion, or $1.99 a share,
climbed from $1.14 billion, or $1.71, a year earlier, the New
York-based firm said today in a statement. That was double the
average estimate of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “As the company strings together acceptable quarters,
they’re showing they’re getting back to business as usual, and
it helps support the valuations of the businesses,” said  Robert Haines , an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in New York.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  must increase
insurance profits and divest assets to repay AIG’s $182.3
billion rescue. The firm said last month it will hold a public
offering of its main Asia unit, AIA Group Ltd., after the
collapse in May of a $35.5 billion agreement to sell the
business to Prudential Plc.  
 AIG advanced 88 cents to $40.78 at 3:17 p.m. in New York as
Benmosche said the company is in talks with regulators over a
“complete government exit” from the insurer. AIG has  climbed 
33 percent this year through yesterday, rewarding investors
betting on a rebound, including  Bruce Berkowitz , who runs
Fairholme Capital Management. AIG slipped 4.5 percent in 2009
and  plunged  97 percent in 2008.  
 Private Equity, Hedge Funds  
 Operating profit from U.S. life businesses quadrupled from
a year earlier to $1.05 billion as investment income climbed on
private-equity and hedge fund results. Companywide, so-called
partnership investments generated a $508 million profit in the
quarter, compared with a loss of $193 million a year earlier.  
 AIG incurred an accounting charge of $3.3 billion tied to
the value of American Life Insurance Co., another non-U.S.
division that AIG is selling. The impairment pushed the company
to a net loss of $2.66 billion, compared with net income of
$1.82 billion a year earlier. AIG agreed in March to sell Alico
to MetLife Inc. for about $15.5 billion. MetLife raised funds
this week and plans to complete the deal this year.  
 Realized investment losses narrowed to $564 million from
$899 million in the year-earlier period. AIG’s derivatives
business posted operating loss of about $132 million, little
changed from last year’s second quarter.  
 Corporate Debt  
 Unrealized gains on bonds available for sale surged to
$10.3 billion from $2.45 billion three months earlier on a climb
in the value of corporate debt holdings. The figures, reflecting
market fluctuations that aren’t counted toward earnings, are
monitored by investors and rating firms as a gauge of financial
strength.  
 Chartis, AIG’s property-casualty business, produced $955
million in operating income, a 5.8 percent decline from the
year-earlier period.  
 Chartis booked about $287 million in catastrophe costs from
causes including U.S. floods, hailstorms and Hurricane Alex.
That includes a $23 million loss on the Deepwater Horizon oil
rig explosion. Claims estimates may change because
investigations of the explosion and the cleanup of the spill are
incomplete and litigation has “just begun,” AIG said.  
 AIG’s mortgage insurer, United Guaranty Corp., posted its
second straight quarterly profit, after more than $4 billion in
losses in three years ended Dec. 31. The unit had $226 million
in income, compared with $488 million loss a year earlier.  
 Plane Leasing  
 AIG’s plane-leasing business,  International Lease Finance
Corp. , posted a $182 million profit, a decline of 46 percent
from the year-earlier period on asset impairments. The company
said it struck a deal on July 6 to sell six planes. ILFC said
today that Benmosche has joined the unit’s board.  
 AIG’s consumer lender, American General Finance Corp.,
reported an $11 million operating loss, narrowing from a $202
million loss a year earlier. AIG said today it may sell all or
most of its $2.4 billion stake in the company. Three months ago,
AIG said it was weighing the sale of a majority stake. The
insurer may announce a sale as early as this month, the New York
Times reported today, citing an interview with Benmosche.  
 AIG benefited from a gain in the value of mortgage-linked
assets turned over to Federal Reserve investment vehicles as
part of the bailout. AIG valued its share in the funds, called
Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III, at $6.7 billion as of June
30, compared with $6.2 billion in the first quarter and $5.3
billion at the end of 2009. The Fed holds a majority stake.  
 European Swaps  
 AIG is also weighing using its Maiden Lane holdings to help
repay its bailout, three people with knowledge of the plan said
last month.  
 The insurer’s maximum risk on a book of swaps sold to
European banks narrowed to $64.5 billion as of June 30, compared
with $109.4 billion as of March 31. AIG’s rescue spared European
banks from raising as much as $16 billion in capital in late
2008, the Congressional Oversight Panel said in a June  report .  
 AIG holds about $958 million in California general
obligation bonds compared with about $1.1 billion that the
company disclosed three months ago. The company has almost $50
billion in its portfolio of municipal debt.  
 “Despite the budget pressures facing the sector, AIG does
not expect any significant defaults in portfolio holdings of
municipal issuers,” the company said in a regulatory filing.  
 Exposure to the government of Greece is about $937 million,
AIG. That compares with $1.04 billion held by AIG on May 4.  
 The insurer, once the world’s largest, was first rescued in
September 2008 by the Fed. After three revisions, the firm’s
lifeline includes the $60 billion Fed credit facility, a U.S.
Treasury Department investment of as much as $69.8 billion and
up to $52.5 billion to buy mortgage-linked assets owned or
backed by the company.  
 “We have commenced discussions with the U.S. government on
the process and terms of a complete government exit,” Benmosche
told employees today in a memo. “Depending of course on market
conditions, which could remain volatile, we expect to make
meaningful progress in 2010 on repaying the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, and over time fully repaying all of our obligations
to taxpayers.”
