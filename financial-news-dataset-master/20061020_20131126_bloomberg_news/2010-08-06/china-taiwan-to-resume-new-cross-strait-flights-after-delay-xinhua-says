             China and Taiwan agreed to resume a
plan to add 100 cross-strait flights after Taiwan suspended some
new routes earlier this month, the official Xinhua News Agency
said today.  
 The two aviation authorities said they will “as soon as
possible” raise the number of weekly flights to 370 from 270,
as agreed in May, Xinhua said, without citing anyone.  
 China and Taiwan authorities held two days of talks ending
today to resolve disputes over the May agreement.
