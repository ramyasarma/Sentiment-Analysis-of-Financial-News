 Tomkins Plc, the target of a takeover
bid, said first-half sales rose about 23 percent to $2.43
billion, and reiterated that the board considers the offer
“fair and reasonable.”  
 Net income in the period was $170.1 million, compared with
a loss of $123.9 million a year earlier, Tomkins said in a
statement today.
