             Investors should buy the Canadian and
Australian dollars and simultaneously sell the British pound to
benefit from the effect soaring wheat prices will have on
currency markets, BNP Paribas SA said.  
 “The wheat price-related food price explosion will diverge
global inflation trends further from here,” analysts at the
French bank wrote today. “The biggest net importers relative to
the size of gross domestic product are the U.K. and Japan, while
the U.S., Canada and Australia are net exporters. Relative to
the size of the underlying economies, the income-generating
positive terms-of-trade effect is biggest in Canada.”  
 In the U.K., higher prices for imported food will weigh on
consumer incomes at the same time as the effects of government
budget cuts, BNP wrote. In Canada, food inflation will be “more
than offset by rising farm income,” the note said.  
 Canada’s dollar will likely climb against the Australian
dollar given the latter country is more exposed to an
“inflating China” and has already sold its winter wheat
harvest forward at lower historic prices, the note said. The
wheat boom may support the U.S. dollar by shoring up banks in
the Midwest that had struggled with loans to farmers, BNP said.
