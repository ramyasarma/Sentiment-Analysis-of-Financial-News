             Magna International Inc. , Canada’s
largest auto-parts maker, posted second-quarter earnings that
beat analyst estimates, helped by higher production and complete
vehicle assembly sales.  
 Net income surged to $293 million, or $2.59 per share, for
the three months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $205
million, or a loss of $1.83 per share, for the same period a
year earlier, the Aurora, Canada-based company said today in a
statement distributed by PR Newswire. Earnings beat the median
estimate of $159 million forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  
 Sales increased 63 percent to $6.1 billion. Magna forecast
2010 consolidated sales of between $22 billion and $23 billion,
based on full-year light vehicle production volumes of about
11.5 million units in North America and about 12 million in
Europe.  
 The company increased its quarterly dividend to 30 cents
per share.
