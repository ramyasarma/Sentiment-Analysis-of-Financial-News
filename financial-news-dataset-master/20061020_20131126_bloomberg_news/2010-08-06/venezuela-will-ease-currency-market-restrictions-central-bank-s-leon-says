               Venezuela  will ease some restrictions
to allow companies to access the currency market after President  Hugo Chavez  banned unregulated trades,  Armando Leon , a  central
bank  director, said today in an interview.  
 Companies that aren’t authorized to buy dollars at official
exchange rates will be allowed to use the central bank’s market,
known as Sitme, for such trades, Leon said. The goal is to make
foreign exchange transactions more “fluid,” he said. The bank
also plans to periodically allocate dollars to companies facing
purchase quotas, he said.  
 “In one or two months the market should be running at the
velocity of a cruise ship,” Leon said in an interview in
Caracas. “Sitme will have three sources. Besides bonds from the
financial sector, oil and mining companies with dollars are
selling to obtain bolivars, and bonds from the coming issue will
be used to restock the market.”  
 Chavez closed the unregulated market in May and made the  central bank  the only entity authorized to buy and sell dollar-
denominated bonds. Companies used the unregulated market to
obtain currency at more than two times the official rate when
they didn’t get government authorization.  
 New Rules  
 The  Foreign Exchange Board , known as Cadivi, currently
approves currency purchases made by companies. Cadivi meets 80
percent of the country’s importing needs and has boosted daily
dollar sales to $140 million in July from $100 million in April,
Leon said.  
 The Central Bank will facilitate rules for companies
importing liquor and car parts to register with Cadivi, allowing
them to buy dollars through Sitme. The bank will also directly
sell dollars to large corporations in the telecommunications,
textile and chemical industries, Leon said.  
 The Sitme market will be funded through the sale of bonds
from private banks, dollars from foreign companies and
government debt issues, he said. The bank sold more than $1
billion through the market since it opened on June 9, at an
average exchange rate of 5.3 bolivars per dollar.  
 There are no plans to raise the purchase limits of $50,000
a day and $350,000 a month that companies now face, Leon said.  
 Chavez banned brokerages from participating in the  currency
market  and closed more than 40 firms, accusing them of  money
laundering , setting artificial exchange rates and capital
flight. Companies used the brokerages to skirt currency
controls, paying as much as 8.2 bolivars per dollar in the
unregulated market.  
 “This is not the unregulated market,” he said of a plan
to allocate dollars to companies. “That market is history.”
