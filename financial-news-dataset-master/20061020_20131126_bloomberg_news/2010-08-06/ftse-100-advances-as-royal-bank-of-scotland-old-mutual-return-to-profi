             U.K. stocks  fell for a fourth day as
a government report showed the U.S. lost more jobs than forecast
last month, adding to concern about the strength of the recovery
in the world’s largest economy.  
 Lonmin Plc led declining shares after South Africa ordered
the company to halt sales of non-platinum group metals.
SABMiller Plc and Diageo Plc dropped more than 2 percent amid
concern that Russia’s ban on wheat and barley exports may
further drive up the price of commodities used in beer
production. Connaught Plc plunged 45 percent after saying it
will record a “material loss” for the full year.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  slid 33.39, or 0.6 percent, to
5,332.39 as of the 4:30 p.m. close in London, trimming this
weeks’ advance to 1.4 percent. The  FTSE All-Share Index  declined
0.7 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  lost 1 percent today.  
 “Investors are selling out of stocks after non-farm
payrolls fell worse than expected for July,” said  Joshua Raymond , a London-based market strategist at City Index.
“Naturally investors will fear that the recovery could be
losing momentum.”  
 Labor Department figures showed overall employment in the
U.S. fell 131,000 in July, missing the average forecast for a
decline of 65,000. Unemployment held at 9.5 percent while
private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose by
71,000, missing economists’ average forecast of 90,000.  
 Company Earnings  
 The FTSE 100 has rallied 11 percent from this year’s low on
July 1 as companies reported earnings that topped analyst
estimates and concern eased that the global economy may be
tipping back into recession. The gauge is still 8.5 percent
below this year’s high in April.  
 Lonmin  dropped 5.1 percent to 1,557 pence, the worst
performance in the FTSE 100. The world’s third-biggest platinum
producer late yesterday said it will “vigorously contest” the
order to halt sales of nickel, copper, chrome and any other
minerals other than platinum-group metals.  
 SABMiller placed a retreat in brewing companies as wheat
headed for the biggest weekly gain in half a century. The
world’s second-largest brewer by volume declined 2.4 percent to
1,864 pence, while Diageo, which makes Guinness stout, fell 2.2
percent to 1,079 pence.  
 Russia yesterday banned the export of grain and flour from
Aug. 15 to Dec. 31 as the worst drought in 50 years has eroded
crop yields.  
 Unilever Downgrade  
 Unilever  slid 2.7 percent to 1,689 pence after UBS AG cut
its recommendation on the maker of Magnum ice cream bars to
“neutral” from “buy.”  
 Connaught plummeted 47 percent to 15.5 pence, a record low.
The public-housing maintenance company said a review showed it
will record a “material loss” for the full year and make
“significant writedowns” on the carrying value of assets.  
 In June, Connaught predicted sales would fall by about 80
million pounds ($128 million) in 2010 following U.K. government
budget cuts.  
 Inmarsat Plc  gained 4 percent to 741.5 pence. The world’s
biggest provider of satellite services to the maritime industry
reported a 56 percent jump in first-half pretax profit to $151.8
million as it placed a $1.2 billion order with Boeing Co. for
three satellites.  
 The company proposed an interim dividend of 14 cents, up 10
percent and said it was “confident” of sustaining 10 percent
dividend growth for the three years from 2010 to 2012.  
 Logica Plc surged 6.1 percent to 116.1 pence, the biggest
jump in three months. The Anglo-Dutch computer-services provider
increased its  dividend  and said it will avoid a sharper decline
in revenue from U.K. public-sector contracts in the second half
as the British government slashes spending.  
 BP Plc rose 0.5 percent to 425.35 pence, extending this
week’s rally to 4.8 percent. Europe’s second-biggest oil company
completed a cement plug at the top of its Macondo well in the
Gulf of Mexico, sealing off the source of millions of gallons of
oil spewed into the sea after a drilling rig exploded in April.
