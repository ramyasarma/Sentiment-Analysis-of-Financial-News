             Pork-belly futures extended a rally
to a record on signs that U.S. supplies are trailing consumer
demand for bacon. Hog and cattle futures dropped.  
 Stockpiles  of pork bellies in warehouses monitored by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange were 73 percent smaller at the end
of July than a year earlier.  Wholesale  prices have surged 84
percent this year, touching a record $1.4308 a pound on Aug. 3,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Pork bellies are cured
and sliced to make bacon.  
 “The amount of pork in the coolers is pretty tight, so
that is a concern,” said  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at
Northstar Commodity Investments Co. in Minneapolis. Demand for
pork, which is  cheaper  than beef, has increased during the U.S.
economic decline as more people seek lower-priced food, he said.  
 Pork-belly futures for August delivery rose by the CME’s
daily limit of 4.5 cents, or 3.8 percent, to close at $1.23 a
pound at 1 p.m. That marked the highest price ever for a most-
active contract since the CME began trading the commodity in
September 1961. Prices jumped by the exchange’s limit every day
this week, gaining 19 percent over five days.  
 U.S. bacon demand tends to peak in August, as tomatoes
ripen in the Midwest and more consumers eat bacon, lettuce and
tomato sandwiches, analysts said.  
 Hogs Slump  
 Hog futures for October settlement slid 1.95 cents, or 2.6
percent, to 74.075 cents a pound. Futures tumbled by as much as
the CME’s 3-cent limit yesterday on concern that a 59 percent
increase in wholesale-pork prices over the past year will erode
U.S. grocer demand, Mayer said. Hog futures fell 6.3 percent for
the week.  
 U.S. meatpackers  shipped  10.4 million pounds (4,717 metric
tons) of pork in the first four days of this week, 37 percent
less than in the same period last year, according to USDA data.
A wholesale-price gauge that includes pork bellies, hams and
other cuts, has declined 1 percent since reaching an 11-week
high on Aug. 3.  
 “Definitely, the pork movement has slowed down, because
you did hit some of the highest prices of the year,” Mayer
said. “You can’t say we’ve officially topped out yet, but if we
haven’t, we’re probably getting close.”  
 Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.775 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 95.5 cents a pound, the first decline in three days,
trimming this week’s gain to 1 percent. Feeder-cattle futures
for September settlement dropped 0.425 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$1.1225 a pound.  
 A slowing U.S. economy may signal beef demand will slump,
pressuring cattle prices, Mayer said. Private companies added
71,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said today, fewer
than economists had estimated.
