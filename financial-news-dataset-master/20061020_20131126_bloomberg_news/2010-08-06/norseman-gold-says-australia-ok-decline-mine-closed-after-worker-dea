             Norseman Gold Plc,  which produced
60,464 ounces of the metal in fiscal 2010, said one of its three
mines at its Norseman project in Western Australia was closed
after the death of a worker.  
 The OK Decline gold mine will remain closed “until further
notice” and there are no initial estimates of the effect on
output, Chief Executive Officer  Barry Cahill  said today in a
phone interview from the site. The Bullen and Harlequin mines
are operating as normal and the cause of yesterday’s death is
being investigated, he said.  
 The Norseman project, 725 kilometers (450 miles) east of
the state capital Perth, is Australia’s longest continuously
running gold mining operation, according to the company’s
 website . The state government of Western Australia, which
accounts for 62 percent of national mineral output, in September
said it would overhaul the mining industry’s safety regime.  
 “The recent spike in mine site-related fatalities remains
unacceptable and only highlights the need for urgent action,”
Mines and Petroleum Minister  Norman Moore  said today in a
statement.  
 Norseman Gold , which in July forecast output of as much as
110,000 ounces this fiscal year, fell 3.3 percent to 73.5 cents
at 1:56 p.m. Sydney time on the Australian stock exchange. It
has dropped 19 percent this year.
