             The forint strengthened, extending
the world’s biggest rally this week against the euro, as
Hungary’s shrinking budget gap stoked optimism the country may
fund itself without International Monetary Fund backing.  
 The forint appreciated for a third day, trading 0.4 percent
higher at 278.76 per euro as of 3:59 p.m. in Budapest. It pared
earlier gains of as much as 0.7 percent after a report showed
U.S. companies added fewer jobs than economists forecast. The
forint was still up 1.8 percent this week, the biggest rally
among more than 170 currencies worldwide tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Hungary’s budget deficit dropped to 997.5 billion forint
($4.8 billion) at the end of July after the government reported
a surplus of 36.1 billion forint last month, the Economy
Ministry late yesterday. The average yield fell to 5.66 percent
at the sale of 12-month Treasury bills, from 5.75 percent at the
previous auction on July 22.  
 “The successful debt auction pushed the forint below 280
per euro and the budget data has helped keep it there,”  Peter Karsai , a currency trader at Commerzbank AG in Budapest, said in
a phone interview today. “The sentiment is optimistic.”  
 Hungary was the first European Union country to obtain an
IMF-led bailout in 2008 when demand for the country’s debt dried
up. The forint plunged 2.9 percent on July 19 to its weakest in
almost 15 months and government borrowing costs increased after
the IMF and European Union ended talks with the government
without endorsing the cabinet’s budget plans.  
 ‘Plenty to Compensate’  
 The forint was the world’s worst-performing currency in the
second quarter as European governments struggled to contain
budget deficits and Hungary roiled global markets by comparing
its finances to those of Greece. It is still 3.4 percent weaker
against the euro this year, compared with a 2.8 percent gain for
Poland’s zloty and a 6.4 percent rally for the Czech koruna.  
 “In the longer run, the forint has plenty to compensate
compared with regional currencies,” said Karsai.  
 Hungary’s foreign-trade surplus increased in June to 566.9
million euros ($748 million) from 423.6 million euros in May and
327.4 million euros a year earlier, the statistics office in
Budapest said today.
