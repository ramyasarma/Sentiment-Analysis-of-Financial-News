             U.S. stocks may rally after the ratio
of rising to falling shares increased to an all-time high,
according to Strategas Research Partners.  
 The  advance-decline measure  of companies listed on the New
York Stock Exchange climbed to a record 95,875 on Aug. 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The indicator, which
represents the cumulative number stocks that rise minus those
that fall, was set at zero on Aug. 20, 1996. It predicted
rallies in July 2009 and February 2010, said  Christopher Verrone , lead technical analyst at Strategas.  
 “It’s a significant development,” said New York-based
Verrone. “Participation is broadening out. It’s telling us that
breadth and momentum are expanding into the rally. The move that
we’ve seen off the July low looks a lot healthier than the ones
we’ve seen over the last couple of months. It argues for the
market to continue to climb higher.”  
 The  S&P 500  rose to a 19-month closing high of 1,217.28 on
April 23 amid optimism about the economic expansion. The index
fell as much as 16 percent through July 2 on concern that
widening budget deficits in Europe could derail the global
economic rebound. Since then, the gauge rallied 10 percent to
1,125.81 through yesterday.  
 “If we move through 1,131, the move through 1,173
definitely happens,” Verrone said. “As we approach that level,
if the backdrop is still the same, you get set up into the back
half of the year for a move back to that April high.”  
 Technical analysts such as Verrone use price and volume
graphs to forecast whether securities will rise or fall.
