             Canadian stocks  rose, completing a
weekly gain, as gold share rallied after U.S. and Canadian
employment reports missed estimates and Research In Motion Ltd.
gained on speculation it can avert a ban on BlackBerry services
in Saudi Arabia.  
 Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer of the
metal, advanced 2.8 percent as gold futures climbed for an
eighth day. RIM advanced 3.5 percent. Magna International Inc.,
Canada’s largest auto-parts maker, surged 7.5 percent as it beat
analysts’ estimates for second-quarter profit.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  increased 25.20
points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,799.97 at 4:12 p.m. in Toronto,
for a 0.7 percent weekly gain.  
 “When there’s economic jitters people always go to gold,”
said  Sadiq Adatia , who helps manage C$12 billion ($11.6 billion)
as chief investment officer at Russell Investment Canada in
Toronto. “And RIM cannot not be in those markets -- people will
back away from that a little bit.”  
 The S&P/TSX has gained less than 0.5 percent this year as a
 U.S. unemployment rate  stuck at 9.5 percent dimmed the impact of
stronger-than-forecast corporate earnings. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Commodity Price Index  has dropped 3.1
percent. Energy and raw-materials companies make up 46 percent
of Canadian stocks by market value.  
 Canadian stocks fell earlier after the Labor Department
said U.S. private payrolls expanded by 71,000 last month,
compared with the average economist estimate of 90,000. June’s
figure was reduced to 31,000 from a preliminary 83,000.  
 Missed Forecast  
 Canadian payrolls shrank by 9,300 jobs in July, the first
drop this year, Statistics Canada said. Twenty-one of 22
economists in a  Bloomberg survey  had forecast a gain in
employment.  
 Gold futures gained 0.5 percent to extend their longest
rally since November as the U.S. employment report dragged the
 U.S. Dollar Index  to its lowest level since April 14, boosting
the appeal of precious metals as alternative assets.  
 Barrick advanced 2.8 percent to C$44.65 for a seventh-
straight rise. Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s  second-largest  gold
producer, increased 2.3 percent to C$41.61. Yamana Gold Inc.,
which mines in South America, rallied 3.3 percent to C$10.24.  
 RIM advanced 3.5 percent to $54.93. The Waterloo, Ontario-
based company and three Saudi Arabian phone carriers are in
talks to avert a ban on BlackBerry services in the country,
after a government deadline to shut off its messaging service
lapsed, two people familiar with the talks said.  
 Dividend Raised  
 Magna International Inc., Canada’s largest auto-parts
maker, surged 7.5 percent to C$81.37 after beating analysts’
average second-quarter profit estimate by  72 percent , excluding
certain items. The company also raised its quarterly  dividend  67
percent to 30 cents a share, payable Sept. 15.  
 GMP Capital Inc. surged 4.7 percent to C$9.79. Canada’s
second-largest non-bank brokerage raised its quarterly dividend
to 6 cents a share from 5 cents a share.  
 Manulife Financial Corp. fell 1.2 percent to C$14.03 to add
on to yesterday’s 11 percent decline, which followed the
announcement of a wider-than-forecast second-quarter loss. Other
financial shares declined. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s
biggest bank, decreased 0.6 percent to C$52.98. Brookfield Asset
Management Inc., the country’s biggest real estate company,
slipped 0.5 percent to C$26.40 after missing all three analysts’
second-quarter  profit estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Crude oil retreated for a third day, while natural gas’s
gains from earlier in the day were wiped out.  
 Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, dropped 0.4 percent to
C$36.44. EnCana Corp., Canada’s biggest natural gas producer,
decreased 1.1 percent to C$32.02.
