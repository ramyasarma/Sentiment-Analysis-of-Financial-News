             Brazil’s  consumer prices  last month
rose at the second-slowest pace since 2006, fueling speculation
that the central bank may slow the pace of  interest rates 
increases as Latin America´s biggest  economy  cools. Yields on
most interest-rate futures fell.  
 The monthly inflation rate, as measured by the benchmark
IPCA index, was 0.01 percent in July, according to the national
statistics agency. The increase, which follows a 0.0 percent
reading in June, was in line with 0.02 percent median  forecast 
of 35 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Twelve-month inflation
slowed to 4.60 percent from 4.84 percent in June.  
 The $1.6 trillion economy may be growing at a sustainable
level, helping to curb inflation risks, the central bank said in
the minutes of its July 20-21 meeting. Surprising 48 of 51
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, policy makers last month
raised the benchmark  rate  by a less-than-expected half-point to
10.75 percent, after consecutive 0.75-point increases.  
 “Given central bank signals and current data, we expect a
quarter-point increase in September, before a pause, then it may
resume raising in the first half of 2010,” said  Flavio Serrano ,
chief economist at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento.  
 Yields Fall, Outlook  
 Following last month’s central bank meeting, economic
reports for June showed Brazil had received less-than-expected
 foreign direct investment  and that industrial output fell 1
percent in the month, the biggest contraction since 2008.  
 Of the yields on the 23 contracts trading in Brazil’s
interest rate futures market trading today, 21 fell and two were
unchanged.  
 The yield on the January 2011 contract, the most traded
contract on Sao Paulo’s BM&F exchange, fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.77 percent at 11:17 a.m. New
York time. The real weakened 0.4 percent to 1.7588 per U.S.
dollar from 1.7518 per dollar yesterday.  
 As economic growth has shown signs of slowing, analysts
have lowered their forecast for year-end inflation to 5.27
percent in the July 30 survey compared with 5.55 percent four
weeks earlier.  
 Inflation has been running above the government´s 4.5
percent target since the start of the year.  
 ‘Calm,’ Recovery  
 Brazil´s economy is forecast to grow 7.2 percent this year,
according to a central bank survey of economists published this
week, after surging 9 percent in the first quarter from the same
period a year earlier, the fastest pace in 15 years.  
 “Inflation in short term is very calm, but monetary policy
needs to aim the long term,” said Serrano. “We expect economic
activity to recover in the third, fourth quarter and capacity
utilization is still high.”  
 Food prices fell 0.76 percent in the month, following a 0.9
percent decline in June. The cost of non-food products rose 0.24
percent in July, compared with 0.27 percent the previous month.  
 The central bank targets 4.5 percent inflation, plus or
minus two percentage points  
 “Food prices are getting back to normal levels, may start
rising again in late August and we’ve yet to see if they’ll
spread to the rest of the economy,” said Serrano. “It may be
necessary to make a little additional increase of interest rates
to ensure inflation will converge to the target next year.”
