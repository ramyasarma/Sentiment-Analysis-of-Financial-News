             Life Insurance Corp. of India, the
country’s largest money manager, said its assets under
management rose 32 percent in the fiscal year ended March 31.  
 The Mumbai-based insurer’s assets increased to 11.52
trillion rupees ($250 billion) and it reported a valuation
surplus of 234 billion rupees for the period. Total premium
income climbed 18 percent to 1.86 trillion rupees, the insurer
said in a statement today.  
 Life Insurance, which manages more money than all Indian
mutual funds combined, bought the nation’s equities in 2008 as
overseas investors shunned emerging-market assets in the midst
of the global credit crisis, triggering the largest outflows
from Indian stocks that year and their biggest annual slump.  
 The insurer plans to invest 2 trillion rupees in stocks and
bonds in the fiscal year that started in April 1, Chairman T.S.
Vijayan said in a briefing to reporters today. Life Insurance
has made investments worth 390 billion rupees in the quarter
ended June 30, including equity investments worth 100 billion
rupees, Vijayan said.  
 The insurance company’s market share increased to 73
percent in terms of the number of policies sold, from 70.5
percent, he said.
