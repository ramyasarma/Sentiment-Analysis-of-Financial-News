             The Uganda Securities Exchange said
it appointed Joseph Kitamirike as its new chief executive
officer, after the 10-year term of his predecessor, Simon
Rutega, ended.  
 Kitamirike, who has been chief executive of National
Housing and Construction Corp. for the past six years, will take
up the post on Aug. 9, the Kampala-based bourse said on its
website. He is expected to guide the exchange in “the formation
of an integrated regional market,” it said.
