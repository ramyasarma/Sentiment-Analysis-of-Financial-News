             France’s trade deficit widened in the
first half to about 24.5 billion euros, Le Figaro reported,
citing an interview with Trade Minister Anne-Marie Idrac.  
 The deficit rose from 20 billion euros in the second half,
primarily as a result of the increase in the price of oil, the
newspaper cited her as saying. Oil price gains contributed to
three-quarters of the widening of the trade gap, she said.  
 Exports expanded by 10 percent in the first six months
compared with the year-earlier period, she was cited as saying.
