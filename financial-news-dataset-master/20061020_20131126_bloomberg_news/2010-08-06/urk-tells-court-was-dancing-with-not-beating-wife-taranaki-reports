             A Turkish immigrant says he was
performing a traditional Turkish dance with his wife, not
beating her, when he was arrested for assault in New Zealand,
 Taranaki  Daily News reported.  
 Police arrested Alaettin Can after a passer-by saw him
seemingly hitting, kicking and strangling his wife Elmas outside
their Yildiz kebab shop in the town of Hawera, the Wellington-
based newspaper said.  
 Defense attorney Grant Vosseler said the couple was
actually performing a traditional dance called the kolbasti,
which includes actions such as “fake kicking, hitting,
headlocks, throwing and falling,” the newspaper said. The
kolbasti originates from the Black Sea region of Turkey and
Vosseler presented a DVD of the dance to the court as evidence,
Taranaki said.  
 The couple was celebrating an exceptionally profitable
lunch shift along with their children in the parking lot outside
their kebab shop when they were spotted, Can told Taranaki.
“We’re always dancing,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.
“What’s wrong with that?”
