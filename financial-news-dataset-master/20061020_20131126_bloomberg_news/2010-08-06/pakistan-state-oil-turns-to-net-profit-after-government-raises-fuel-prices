             Pakistan State Oil Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest fuel retailer, posted a full-year profit after the
government increased the prices of gasoline and diesel, boosting
the value of its inventory.  
 Net income in the year ended June 30 was 9.05 billion
rupees ($105.5 million), or 52.76 rupees a share, compared with
a loss of 6.69 billion rupees, or 39.05 rupees, a year earlier,
the Karachi-based company said in a statement to the  stock
exchange  today. Sales climbed to 877.2 billion rupees from 719.3
billion rupees.  
 “Higher valuation of fuel stockpiles helped the company
to post gains,” said  Khurram Schehzad , head of research at
Invest Capital & Securities Ltd. in Karachi, who has a “buy”
recommendation on the stock. “Volumetric sales also increased
by 8 percent, adding to the gains.”  
 The government increased fuel prices by about 6 percent in
the year, according to Invest Capital & Securities.  
 The South Asian nation, which imports about 85 percent of
the oil it uses domestically, reviews domestic fuel prices
regularly to reflect movements in the global markets. Pakistan
raised gasoline prices three times during the year after three
increases in the preceding year.  
 Pakistan State Oil shares fell 3.1 percent to 272.50 rupees
as of 2:42 p.m. local time on the Karachi Stock Exchange, after
 falling  8.6 percent this year. The company plans to pay a year-
end cash dividend of five rupees a share.
