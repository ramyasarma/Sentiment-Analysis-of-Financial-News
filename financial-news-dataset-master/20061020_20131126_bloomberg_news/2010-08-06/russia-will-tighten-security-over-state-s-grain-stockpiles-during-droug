             Russia is boosting security over the
state’s 9.5 million metric tons of grain stockpiles as the worst
drought in at least half a century erodes yields, said the
government agent overseeing the reserves.  
 “United Grain Co. has introduced additional security
measures for grain in the state intervention fund,” the agent
said in an e-mailed statement today. “The role of state
stockpiles in the domestic market is increasing as the situation
in the Russian grain market becomes more acute because of
wildfires and drought in more than 25 regions.”   
 Russia yesterday set a ban on grain and flour exports from
Aug. 15 to Dec. 31 and published the  order  in the state’s
newspaper of record today. Russia forecasts this year’s grain
crop at between 70 million and 75 million tons, while domestic
consumption stands at 75 million tons. The country has 21.5
million tons in reserves, including the state’s stockpiles.
