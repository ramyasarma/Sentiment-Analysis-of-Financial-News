             Former president of Brazil’s central
bank and chairman of  BM&F Bovespa SA ,  Arminio Fraga , said the
central bank should analyze inflationary pressures before making
decisions on the basic interest rate.  
 “The market, if you look at the interest rate, is still
projecting an increase, and I think this is to do with the fact
that the economy is still at idle minimum capacity,” he said
yesterday in an interview on  XPTV , the online channel of the Rio
de Janeiro brokerage  XP Investimentos CCTVM SA .  
 “There is some pressure in the labor market,” he said.
The trend is for rates to fall in the coming years, “not now,”
he added.
