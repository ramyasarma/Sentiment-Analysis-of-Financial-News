             BP Plc’s incoming Chief Executive
Officer Robert Dudley offered to sell projects in Vietnam,
Pakistan and Venezuela to OAO Rosneft and TNK-BP, Vedomosti said
today, citing an unnamed official closed to the British company.  
 Dudley and outgoing CEO Tony Hayward discussed large deals
with Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who is also chairman of
Rosneft, during meetings in Moscow earlier this week, Vedomosti
reported, citing an unnamed government official. TNK-BP may be
interested in Vietnamese assets, the newspaper said.  
 Vladimir Buyanov, a BP spokesman in Moscow, declined to
comment when called by Bloomberg News.
