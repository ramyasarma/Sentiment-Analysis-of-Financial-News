             European Union Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger wants to unify rules on renewable energy in
the bloc, Financial Times Deutschland said, citing an interview
with the politician.  
 Oettinger will discuss with energy ministers early next
month whether minimum levels of renewable energy that have to be
fed into the grid should be set and how the incentive system
should be structured, the German newspaper reported.
