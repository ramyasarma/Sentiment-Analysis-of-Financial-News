             Expedia Inc. , the biggest Internet
travel agency, and  International Business Machines Corp. , the
world’s biggest computer services provider, sold bonds with
coupons at historic lows this week.  
 Expedia sold 10-year notes at its lowest coupon for any
maturity and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, issued 1 percent
three-year notes that carry the lowest interest rate of the more
than 3,400 securities in the Barclays Capital U.S. Corporate
Index of investment-grade company debt.  
 Debt sales reached $35.9 billion this the week, the most
since March 26, when issuance totaled $39 billion. Borrowers
took advantage of what  Andrew Karp , head of investment grade
debt syndicate, the Americas, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
called “outstanding” demand.  
 “Books have been multiple-times oversubscribed,” Karp
said. “It’s not uncommon to have deals five to eight times
covered. Given the depth of demand, this is a very benign
environment for spreads.”  
 The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
debt instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 1 basis point to 187 basis
points, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
Corporate Master index. Average yields on the debt increased
half a basis point to 4.006 percent from the lowest since March
2004. The yield on the 10-year  Treasury note , the market
Bellwether, fell 0.4 basis point to 2.901 percent.  
 Newell, Expedia  
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc ., the maker of Calphalon cookware and
Sharpie markers, and Expedia had record-low coupon interest
rates on their bonds. Atlanta-based Newell Rubbermaid sold 10-
year notes that carry the company’s cheapest coupon for debt of
similar maturity since at least 1976, according to Bloomberg
data that goes back to that year.  
 Expedia tapped the market for the first time in more than
two years, selling $750 million of notes in a boosted offering
after earlier marketing $500 million.  
 “Our hope had been to possibly exceed the $500 million but
we wanted to make sure demand was there in the market,” said
Chief Financial Officer  Michael Adler . “We found significant
amounts of excessive demand which allowed us to upsize to $750
million.”  
 The 5.95 percent notes yielded 300 basis points more than
similar maturity Treasuries and were the company’s largest
offering, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Expedia last sold debt in June 2008, when it issued $400
million of 8.5 percent notes due 2016. The Bellevue, Washington-
based company’s next lowest coupon is on its $500 million of
7.456 percent notes due 2018, Bloomberg data show.  
 Junk Spreads Narrow  
 High-yield, high-risk, or junk, spreads declined 6 basis
points to 651 basis points, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index. Yields on the debt
fell 5 basis points to 8.46 percent, the least since May 5, the
index data show. Junk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “Deals seem to be pricing with smaller and smaller
concessions” to existing issues, Karp said. “That’s a function
of significant amounts of demand.”  
 IBM and  Xcel Energy Inc.  led $30.6 billion of investment-
grade sales, Bloomberg data show. That’s 193 percent above this
year’s weekly average of $15.9 billion. High-yield sales reached
$5.2 billion, above the $4.6 billion average.  
 Utility Bonds  
 Xcel, the Minneapolis-based owner of utilities that operate
in eight states, sold the cheapest 30-year bonds in the U.S.
market in at least 15 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Xcel’s Northern States Power Co. issued $250 million
of 4.85 percent, 30-year securities and $250 million of 1.95
percent, five-year notes, Bloomberg data show.  
 “You’re not getting much of a concession” on some of the
new debt, said  Rajeev Sharma , who oversees $1.4 billion of
investment-grade credit at First Investors Management in New
York. “At least you’re getting something - some chance for a
compression” in secondary-market spreads.  
 Newell Rubbermaid sold $550 million of 10-year notes that
pay less than half the coupon of its decade-long debt issued
last year, Bloomberg data show.  
 The 4.7 percent debt Bloomberg yielded 175 basis points
more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, the data show.
Treasurer Dale Metz said “very strong” demand of four to five
times oversubscription at the time of pricing drove pricing for
the offering.  
 “We hoped to get a low 5 percent coupon and crashed
through the 4 percent barrier and ultimately down to 4.7
percent,” Metz said.  
 Proceeds will help fund a tender offer for Newell’s 10.6
percent notes due in 2019 that the company sold in March 2009
and the repurchase of $500 million of stock, the company said in
an Aug. 2 statement distributed by Business Wire.
