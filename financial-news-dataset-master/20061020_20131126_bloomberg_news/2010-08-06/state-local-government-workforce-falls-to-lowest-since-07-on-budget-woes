             The number of workers employed by
U.S. state and local governments fell to the lowest since 2007
as municipalities cut payrolls to balance their budgets.  
 Local governments  such as cities and counties shed 38,000
jobs in July, figures from the U.S. Labor Department showed
today. Local payrolls shrank to 14.35 million in the second-
largest monthly drop since 2003, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  States  cut 10,000 jobs to 5.13 million. The totals
were the lowest since July 2007 and October 2007, respectively.  
 “It’s simply a reflection of the severity of the recession
that’s squeezed state budgets,” said  Paul Dales , U.S. economist
for Capital Economics Ltd. in Toronto. “It takes some while for
states to realize how bad the financial situation was; they get
taxes sometime after the actual income is paid.”  
 The recession choked tax collections and drove deficits in
46 states to a total of $121 billion, or about a fifth of their
fiscal 2011 budgets, the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities said in a  report  July 15.  
 U.S. employment, including government jobs, fell by 131,000
in July and the unemployment rate held at 9.5 percent, the Labor
Department said. The figures took account of about 143,000
temporary Census workers who were let go, according to the Labor
report.  
 Private Employers  
 While private employers have added private-sector
employment declines were the worst of the recession, in the
seven months that ended in April 2009, payrolls sank by more
than 500,000 each month.  State  and  local  government never
declined by more than 9,000 in that period, and even rose in
some months, according to Bloomberg data.  
 “States have rainy-day funds for economic downturns to
prevent layoffs,” said Phil Oliff, a policy analyst for the
 Center on Budget . “At this point, most states have burned
through their rainy-day funds.”
