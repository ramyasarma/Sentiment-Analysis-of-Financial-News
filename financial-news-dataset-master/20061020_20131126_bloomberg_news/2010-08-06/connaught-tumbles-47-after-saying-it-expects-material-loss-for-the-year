             Connaught Plc , a U.K. public-housing
maintenance company, fell 47 percent after saying a review
showed the company will record a full-year “material loss” on
earnings before interest, tax and amortization.  
 Connaught will also make “significant writedowns” on the
carrying value of assets as of Aug. 31, 2009, the Exeter,
England-based company said today in a statement on the
Regulatory News Service. Chairman Roy Gardner said the company
will continue to seek refinancing.  
 “This is a business worth fighting for and my new team and
I ask for your continued support for our efforts to rebuild
Connaught,” Gardner said in the statement.  
 In June, Connaught predicted revenue would drop by about 80
million pounds ($127 million) this year, because of cutbacks in
the coalition U.K. government’s emergency budget. Last month,
Chief Executive Officer  Mark Tincknell  quit with immediate
effect.  
 The Ebita loss will include one-time items, and at a so-
called adjusted Ebita level for the year ended Aug. 31, the
company “will be no better than break-even,” Connaught said in
the statement.  
 Connaught also said it expects making provisions for future
losses on current contracts for the fiscal year.  
 Connaught declined 13.5 pence to close at 15.5 pence at
4:30 p.m. in London. The shares have plummeted 96 percent so far
this year, giving it a market value of 21.7 million pounds.
