             India’s National Textile Corp., a
state-owned company that runs mills, received double the reserve
price in an auction of land in central Mumbai.  
 Indiabulls Infraestate Ltd., a unit of developer  Indiabulls
Real Estate Ltd. , paid 15.05 billion rupees ($326 million) for
the Bharat Textile Mills land in Mumbai, National Textile’s
Chairman K. Ramachandran Pillai said in New Delhi today.  
 The Tata group and Oberoi Constructions Pvt. were among
seven companies vying to buy the 8.37 acre (3.4 hectares) plot
in the three-day auction that ended today.  National Textile  had
a minimum price of 7.5 billion rupees.  
 The success of the auction, which follows one last week,
has prompted National Textile to raise its estimate for proceeds
from the sale of eight Mumbai properties to 80 billion rupees
from 50 billion rupees in the year to March 31, Pillai said.  
 Indiabulls Infratech paid 90 percent more than the reserve
price for a plot of land in central Mumbai auctioned by the
textile maker last week. The developer paid 4.74 billion rupees
for the Podar Mills (Process House) land.  
 National Textile ’s sale of 10.77 acres in the two auctions
raised 19.8 billion rupees, in line with the 20 billion rupees
estimate of Textile Minister Dayanidhi Maran on July 29.
