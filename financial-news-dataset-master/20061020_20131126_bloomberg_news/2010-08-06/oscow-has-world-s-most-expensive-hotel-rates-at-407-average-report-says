             Moscow retained its ranking as the
city with the most expensive average hotel room rate in the
world, a survey by business travel agency  Hogg Robinson Group
Plc  showed.  
 The average rate in the city in the first half was 256.83
pounds ($407), Hogg Robinson said in a report on its  website 
today. Geneva followed as the second-most expensive city at
199.11 pounds and Hong Kong at 197.61 pounds.  
 The hotel market in Europe and the U.S. “appears to be
stabilizing,” with cities including Amsterdam, Stockholm and
Zurich showing increases in average room rates, according to the
report. Hotels are recovering after struggling to attract
business over the past two years as the recession deterred
holidaymakers and forced companies to cut budgets.  
 “Globally, the hotel industry has shown signs of recovery
in the first half of 2010,” Hogg Robinson spokeswoman Margaret
Bowler said in the report. “Moscow yet again retains its place
as the city with the highest average room rate for the sixth
year, despite a fall of 12 percent when measured in local
currency.”  
 Average room rates advanced 13 percent in Stockholm, 7
percent in Zurich and 5 percent in Geneva during the six months,
Hogg Robinson said.  
 Room rates in Abu Dhabi showed the highest average rate
reduction, falling 25 percent, due to a drop in occupancy and
new hotel developments. Rome, Copenhagen and Dubai also showed
reductions of 7 percent, 10 percent and 12 percent respectively.  
 London’s average room rates advanced 1 percent, after a
“significant” increase in corporate occupancy levels and
“buoyant” demand from leisure travelers, as well as the
weakness of the British pound against other currencies.  
 U.S. room rates were “flat or marginally lower,” except
for San Francisco, where average rates fell by 11 percent.  
 A drop in demand and oversupply in places contributed to
the fall in prices in Bangalore, Belfast and Beijing, where
rates fell 21 percent, 12 percent and 19 percent in British
pounds, while currency fluctuations caused most of the rise in
prices in British pounds in Australia and South Africa, the
report said.
