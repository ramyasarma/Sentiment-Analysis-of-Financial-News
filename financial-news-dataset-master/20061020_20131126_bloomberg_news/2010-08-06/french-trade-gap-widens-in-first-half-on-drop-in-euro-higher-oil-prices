             France’s trade deficit widened in the
first half to 24.5 billion euros ($32.3 billion), Trade Minister
Anne-Marie Idrac said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The deficit rose from 20 billion euros in the second half
of 2009, primarily as a result of the drop in the euro relative
to the U.S. dollar and the increase in the price of oil, she
said. Exports expanded by 10 percent in the first six months
compared with the year-earlier period, she said.  
 Exports to China rose by 36 percent in the first half and
by 51 percent to Brazil, she said.  
 In June, France’s trade gap narrowed to 3.8 billion euros
from 5.2 billion euros in May.
