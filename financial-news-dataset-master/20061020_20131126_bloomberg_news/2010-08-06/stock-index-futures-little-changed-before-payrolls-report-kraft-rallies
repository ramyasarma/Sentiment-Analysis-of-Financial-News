             U.S. stock-index futures gained,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will extend this
week’s advance, as investors awaited a government payrolls
report for indications on the strength of the economic recovery.  
 Kraft Foods Inc. rallied 2.2 percent in Germany after the
world’s second-largest food company reported better-than-
expected earnings. American International Group Inc. rose 1
percent as second-quarter adjusted earnings beat estimates.
Activision Blizzard Inc. dropped 6 percent after the largest
video-game publisher forecast third-quarter profit below the
average analyst estimate.  
 Futures  on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  expiring in
September rose 0.2 percent to 1,125.7 at 7:30 a.m. in New York.
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  futures advanced 0.1 percent to
10,647 and Nasdaq-100 Index futures gained 0.2 percent to
1,904.75.  
 “The U.S. economy is now in a very difficult spot and
recovery is decidedly sub-par,”  Bernd Weidensteiner , Frankfurt-
based U.S. economist at Commerzbank AG, said in a Bloomberg
television interview. “It will take lots of time to improve the
labor market, but at least I think we have turned the corner.”  
 The S&P 500 has risen 2.2 percent so far this week as
companies from Humana Inc. to Allergan Inc. reported earnings
that topped analyst estimates. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
equities has climbed 10 percent from this year’s low on July 2.  
 Payrolls Report  
 Today’s Labor Department report is forecast to show non-
farm payrolls fell by 65,000 in July, reflecting a drop in
federal census workers, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose by
90,000 workers after growing by 83,000 in June, while the
 unemployment rate  likely climbed to 9.6 percent from 9.5
percent, according to the survey. The report is scheduled for
release at 8.30 a.m. in Washington.  
 The “private payrolls figure is much more important,”
Weidensteiner said. “We expect an increase of about 100,000
which would not be brilliant but OK. Anything below 50,000 would
be a weak result and anything below zero would be more or less
disastrous.”  
 Nobel Prize-winning economist  Joseph E. Stiglitz  said the
U.S. economic recovery is “anemic” and called for a second
round of “better-designed” stimulus.  
 ‘So Weak’  
 “The recovery is so weak that it is not strong enough to
generate new jobs for the new entrants in the labor force, let
alone to find jobs for the 15 million Americans who would like a
job and can’t get one,” Stiglitz told Bloomberg Television in
an interview in Sydney yesterday.  
 Kraft  climbed 2.2 percent to $30.30 after the maker of
Oreos and Cadbury chocolate reported a 13 percent rise in
second-quarter profit to $937 million, or 60 cents a share, on
an improving performance in Europe and emerging markets.
Analysts had anticipated 52 cents, the average of projections
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 AIG, the insurer rescued by the U.S., advanced 1 percent to
$40.29 in pre-market New York trading after the company posted
second-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.99 a share. The average
of two estimates in a Bloomberg survey was 99 cents.  
 Separately, AIG said it may sell all of its $2.4 billion
stake in American General Finance Inc.  
 Crocs Inc. increased 7.4 percent to $13.51 in German
trading after the maker of plastic clogs forecast third-quarter
profit of at least 22 cents a share, beating the average analyst
estimate of 15 cents in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Activision, controlled by France’s  Vivendi SA , dropped 5.9
percent to $11.06 in Germany after the video-game publisher
forecast third-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’
estimates.  
 Excluding changes in deferred revenue, sales this quarter
will be $725 million, compared with the average analyst
projection of $914.5 million. The company forecast adjusted
earnings of 8 cents a share, below the 12-cent average estimate.
