             Swiss stocks  fell after a report
showing lower-than-expected private job creation in the U.S.
stoked concern that the global economy is slowing.  
 Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s second-largest
reinsurer, dropped 4.6 percent. Nestle SA, the world’s largest
food company, retreated 1.1 percent.  
 The  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies declined 0.6 percent to 6,336.57 at 3:20 p.m.
in Zurich, for a 2.2 percent gain this week. The measure earlier
gained as much as 0.6 percent. The SMI has rebounded 6.6 percent
from this year’s low on July 5, as investors speculated on a
continued increase in corporate profits even as the economic
recovery slows down. The broader  Swiss Performance Index  also
fell 0.6 percent to 5,608.18 today.  
 U.S. private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose
by 71,000 in July, less than the 90,000 forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists, Labor Department figures in Washington
showed today. Payrolls grew by 31,000 in June, less than the
83,000 previously reported.  
 Swiss Re , the world’s second-largest reinsurer, dropped 4.6
percent to Swiss 45.34 francs. JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut the
shares to “neutral” from “overweight,” while Helvea reduced
its rating to “accumulate” from “buy,” both citing the
company’s weakening profitability.  
 Nestle  dropped 1.1 percent to 50.50 francs.
