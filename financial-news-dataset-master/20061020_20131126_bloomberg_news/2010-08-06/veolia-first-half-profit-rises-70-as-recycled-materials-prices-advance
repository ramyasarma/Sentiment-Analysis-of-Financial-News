             Veolia Environnement SA , the world’s
biggest water utility, reported a 70 percent increase in first-
half earnings as prices for recycled materials gained.  
 Net income rose to 374.2 million euros ($493.7 million)
from 220 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company
said today in a statement. That beat the average estimate of
354.7 million euros in a survey of six analysts by Bloomberg.  
 Operating income  rose to 1.13 billion euros from 1.01
billion euros a year earlier. Sales fell to 17.2 billion euros
from 17.4 billion euros.  
 Veolia confirmed a 2010 target to generate positive free
cash flow after a dividend and growth in recurring operating
income, which in March was forecast to rise 4 percent to 8
percent. Calling the price of recycled materials “very good,”
Veolia said in the statement that the recovery in waste volumes
“has been limited and divergent.”  
 Veolia’s smaller competitor  Suez Environnement SA  this week
reported that profit more than doubled in the first-half and
raised financial targets because of an acquisition in Spain and
a pickup in waste treatment and the price of metals and
cardboard. The utilities suffered a slump in earnings last year
as the recession forced industrial clients to idle factories.  
 Veolia has also set a goal of selling 3 billion euros in
assets annually over 2009 to 2011 and cutting 250 million euros
in costs this year.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Antoine Frerot  has announced an
agreement with French state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et
Consignations to merge their transport units to create the
world’s biggest private operator, along with a plan to list the
company called Veolia Transdev.  
 Net Debt  
 Veolia’s net  financial debt  was 16 billion euros from 15.4
billion euros at the end of March.  
 Veolia spent about 4 billion euros in 2007 and 2008 on
 acquisitions  including German trash-handler Sulo Group and TMT,
the waste-management unit of Italy’s Termomeccanica Ecologia.
The utility last year wrote down the value of the German and
Italian waste treatment businesses.  
 Veolia supplies water to about 110 million people worldwide
and collects and manages trash for about 50 million. It provides
public transportation in 28 countries and supplies energy in
Europe and the U.S.
