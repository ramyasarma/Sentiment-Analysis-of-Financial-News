             Natura Cosmeticos SA , Brazil’s
biggest cosmetics maker, was lowered to “market perform” from
“outperform” at Raymond James & Associates Inc., which cited
the stock’s “rich” valuation after it beat the benchmark
Bovespa index.  
 Natura surged 26 percent this year before today, pushing
its price to 27.7 times reported earnings, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the fourth-best performance
on the Bovespa, which slipped 0.3 percent and trades at 15 times
earnings.
