             European stocks pared an earlier
advance, as declines by food and beverage companies offset gains
by basic-resources shares and banks. U.S. futures were little
changed.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.1 percent to
261.6 at 10:28 a.m. in London, after earlier rising as much as
0.7 percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring
in September fell 0.1 percent.
