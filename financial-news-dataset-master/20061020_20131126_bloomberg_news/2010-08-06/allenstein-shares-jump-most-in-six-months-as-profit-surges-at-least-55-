             Hallenstein Glasson Holdings Ltd. 
jumped the most in more than six months in Wellington trading
after the clothing retailer said full-year pretax profit rose at
least 55 percent as margins improved.  
 Pretax profit was between NZ$28.3 million ($21 million) and
NZ$28.8 million in the 12 months ended Aug. 1, the Auckland-
based company said in a statement, citing preliminary results.
The stock rose 6.1 percent, the most since Jan. 29.  
 Margins improved because the company expanded its product
range and was less aggressive with its discounting, the company
said. A stronger New Zealand dollar boosted returns from the
company’s stores in Australia, where sales increased 3.4 percent
in the six months through August.  
 Overall sales rose 2.3 percent in the six months ended Aug.
1. Full-year sales increased 4.5 percent.  
 Hallenstein  rose 22 cents to NZ$3.82 at the 5 p.m. market
close in Wellington. The benchmark  NZX 50 Index  of stocks was
unchanged.
