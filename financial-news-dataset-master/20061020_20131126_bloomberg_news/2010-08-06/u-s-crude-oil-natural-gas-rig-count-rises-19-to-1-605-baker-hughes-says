             Oil and natural-gas rigs operating in
the U.S. rose for a ninth consecutive week, as drilling in Texas
jumped, according to data published by Baker Hughes Inc.  
 The combined oil and gas rig count gained 19, or 1.2
percent, to 1,605, the highest level since January 2009. The
figure reached a 22-year high in 2008, peaking at 2,031.  
 Gas rigs gained 11 to 983, the highest level since February
2009. The count is down 39 percent from a peak of 1,606 in
September 2008.  
 Gas for September delivery fell 13.1 cents, or 2.9 percent,
to settle at $4.467 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Futures fell after a report showing
U.S. jobs growth was less than expected.  
 U.S. oil rigs increased by eight to 611, the highest level
since Jan. 25, 1991. Crude for September delivery dropped $1.31,
or 1.6 percent, to $80.70 a barrel.  
 Baker Hughes also reported that miscellaneous rigs, which
primarily drill for geothermal energy, were unchanged from the
week before at 11.  
 Texas , home to 43 percent of U.S. rigs, saw its count climb
by 16, or 2.4 percent, to 691, the most since January 2009.  
 After Texas, the rig count among major oil-producing states
increased the most in North Dakota, which gained five to 133,
and  Oklahoma , which increased by four to 127. Alaska and
Colorado added one rig each.  
 The rig count fell by four in  Louisiana  to 183. It dropped
by three each in California and New Mexico. It dropped by two in
Pennsylvania and one in West Virginia.  
 Rigs on land climbed by 20, or 1.3 percent, to 1,576, and
rigs in inland waters lost two to 12. Offshore drilling gained
one to 17 rigs, echoing the increase in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Canadian rigs rose by 26, or 6.3 percent, to 389.
