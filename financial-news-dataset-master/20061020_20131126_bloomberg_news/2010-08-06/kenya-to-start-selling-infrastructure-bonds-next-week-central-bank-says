             Kenya’s central bank will probably
start selling 31.6 billion shillings ($398 million) of
infrastructure bonds during the week of Aug. 9 in a sale that
will close near the end of the month, a senior official said.  
 Reuters reported the sale of infrastructure bonds, the
country’s biggest single bond issue, had begun, citing Kenya’s
central bank.  
 “Approvals were delayed,” Jackson Kitili, director of
monetary operations and debt management, said by phone from the
capital Nairobi today. “We expect to start it from next week.”  
 Proceeds of the bonds will be used to finance construction
of roads, energy projects and water systems in the current
fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, Kitili said on Aug. 3.  
 Investors have the option of redeeming a portion of their
investment, which has an interest rate of 6 percent, after six
and seven years, he said.  
 It is the only sale of bonds for infrastructure planned for
2010-11, Kitili said.
