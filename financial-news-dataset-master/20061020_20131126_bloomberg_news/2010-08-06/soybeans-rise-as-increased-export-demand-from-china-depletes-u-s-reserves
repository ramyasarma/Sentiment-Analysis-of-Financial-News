             Soybeans rose for the eighth straight
session on speculation that Chinese demand will reduce
stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s largest producer and
exporter.  
 The U.S. sold 336,000 metric tons of soybeans to China for
delivery after Sept. 1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today. China’s imports in the year ending Sept. 30 may be almost
50 million metric tons, a 22 percent jump from the year before,
the China National Grain & Oils Information Center said today.  
 “It’s all about the rising Chinese demand for U.S.
soybeans,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “As long as China is
still buying, the market is going to be well supported.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 1.5 cents, or
0.1 percent, to $10.305 a bushel at 11:08 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after dropping as much as 0.9 percent. The price
gained 6.6 percent the prior seven sessions.  
 Yesterday, the most-active contract touched $10.49, the
highest price for since Jan. 7, after Russia imposed a ban on
grain exports as a drought damages crops.  
 The U.S. soybean crop was valued at $31.8 billion last
year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government figures
show.
