             (Corrects time frame for cancellations in first paragraph.)  
 Airbus SAS  has suffered 41 order
cancellations this year, following Boeing Co. in losing deals
after financial woes forced Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd. to
cut its backlog with both manufacturers.  
 Airbus signed contracts for 286 planes through the end of
July, benefiting from a surge in orders at the Farnborough Air
Show in England. Cancellations have cut the tally to 245, less
than Boeing’s 255 planes for the seven months.  
 Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, a state-owned company set up in
2006 with the aim of becoming one of the world’s biggest
airplane lessors, said last month it would scale back earlier
orders as the emirate battles the impact of the global credit
crisis. DAE in July dropped orders for seven Airbus wide-body
planes and 18 narrowbody jets, figures released by Airbus show.  
 Airbus spokesman  Stefan Schaffrath  declined to comment on
the cancellations. Aircraft Purchase Fleet, the financial arm of
Italy’s AirOne, canceled two planes in July, the order status in
comparison to the previous month shows, bringing Airbus’s total
cancellations for the month to 27.  
 DAE had placed an order in 2007 for 70 Airbus A320 single-
aisle planes and 30 A350 jets worth about $13 billion at list
prices. DAE also ordered 70 Boeing 737s, 15 787 Dreamliner jets,
10 777-300ERs and five 747-8 freighters that year, valued at
$13.7 billion.  
 Boeing yesterday declined to comment on cancellations of 26
jets that showed up in its weekly tally of orders. A contract
for 15 Dreamliners was removed yesterday from the planemaker’s
online backlog listing for DAE.  
 For the year so far, Toulouse, France-based Airbus
delivered 298 planes, compared with 263 for Boeing. Airbus is
targeting about 500 plane deliveries this year, up from 498 last
year. Boeing on July 28 said it expected to deliver as many as
465 planes this year.
