             Chilean inflation expectations
plunged after prices rose less than forecast in July and traders
trimmed interest-rate  expectations  ahead of a central bank
meeting on Aug. 12.  
 One-year breakeven inflation, a measure of the expected
average pace of annual inflation over the next 12 months, fell
14 basis points today to 4.22 percent, according to Bloomberg
calculations. Six-month breakeven inflation dropped 23 basis
points to 3.84 percent.  
 Prices rose 0.6 percent in July, fastest inflation in 10
months, which was still less than the 0.7 percent median
forecast in Bloomberg’s survey and masked a decline in prices
excluding financial services, groceries and utility bills. The
cost of financial services spiked 20 percent last month because
of a temporary increase in the price of loans, groceries rose
because of frosts and fares on transport in Santiago rose.  
 “The inflation figure was below expectations,” said Juan
Pablo Castro, an economist at Banco Santander SA in Santiago,
who forecast 0.9 percent inflation. “Given the frosts and the
stamp duty, there was an idea that this could have been higher.
Yesterday and the day before there were some market players
saying the central bank could raise by 75 basis points. With
this inflation figure we think the rise would be nearer 50 basis
points than 75 basis points.”  
 Eight of the 17 economists in Bloomberg’s  survey  expected
prices to rise by more than 0.7 percent while five forecast 0.6
percent or less.  
 The inflation forwards market is pricing in 0.36 percent
price rises in August, down from 0.48 percent yesterday,
according to Banco Santander SA prices. The annual pace of
inflation may be 3.15 percent this month, inflation forwards
show, down from 3.25 percent yesterday.  
 “The idea is that the 0.1 or 0.2 percentage point lost
this month isn’t going to be recovered,” Castro said.  
 The Chilean peso rose 0.1 percent today to 514.95 per U.S.
dollar as of 11:53 a.m. from 515.3 at yesterday’s close.  
 The two-year interest-rate swap rate in pesos declined
three basis points to 4.16 percent as of 11:50 a.m. today. The
one-year rate declined one basis point to 3.72 percent.  
 One-year inflation-linked swaps rose 20 basis points to
minus 0.4 percent, the highest since January. Two-year
inflation-linked swaps increased five basis points to 0.59
percent.  
 The gap between nominal and inflation-linked yields
reflects traders views of likely average inflation over the life
of a contract. Breakeven inflation is a measure derived from
that difference.  
 The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to buy Chile’s
newly sold $1 billion 10-year bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries,
rose to 89 basis points today from 85 basis points yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
