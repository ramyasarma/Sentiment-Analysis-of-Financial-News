             One of the best investments of the
last 20 years may be bolted to the hoods of 13,237 yellow cars
in New York City, not traded on an exchange.  
 From 1990 through the end of last month, the cost of
individual medallions for New York City taxicabs increased by
373 percent and corporate medallions by 508 percent, according
to the Taxi and Limousine Commission. The  Standard and Poor’s
500 Index  is up 375 percent over the same period, and the MSCI
World Index climbed 224 percent. Crude oil gained 245 percent.  
 “Taxi medallions are one of the only assets I know of in
the past couple of years that have gone up in this economy,”
said  Andrew Murstein , president of  Medallion Financial Corp. ,
which finances sales of the license that allows drivers to pick
up paying passengers on the street.  
 The average price of a medallion purchased by a taxi
company rose 7.7 percent to $825,000  in July  from a year
earlier, and for individual owners it increased 6.1 percent to
$607,000, according to the commission’s  website .  
 The value of the license has climbed as employers curb use
of company cars, subway fares rise and cabs let customers pay
with credit cards, Murstein said. In 1990, the initial charge
for a taxi was $1.50, with an additional $1.25 per mile,
compared with a $2.50 base and $2 per mile today, said
commission spokesman  Allan Fromberg .  
 The medallion’s performance is a “tangible vote of
confidence in New York City’s overall business climate,”  David Yassky , the commission’s chairman, said in an e-mail.  
 ‘Too Expensive’  
 The six-inch-wide aluminum disks have been on taxis since
the Haas Act of 1937 and usually change owners through brokers.
The average downpayment to finance a medallion is 25 percent of
the price, Murstein said. The city collects a 5 percent transfer
tax on each sale.  
 “Medallions are too expensive,” said Sterlin Mathieu, 38,
who said he’s been driving for a corporate owner for six months.
He would “definitely” want to own one in the future, he said.  
 “Not right now,” said Mathieu, who is originally from
Haiti. “Some people spend 16 to 18 hours driving just to make
enough money and don’t have time to enjoy it.”  
 Medallion Financial reported Aug. 4 that second-quarter
earnings increased 39 percent. Net investment income, not
including gains or losses on investments, climbed to $2.94
million, or 17 cents a share, from $2.12 million, or 12 cents,
in the same period a year earlier, the New York-based firm said
in a statement.  
 Cuomo, Weicker, Aaron  
 The company, whose  board  includes former three-term New
York Governor  Mario Cuomo , 78, former U.S. Senator and
Connecticut Governor  Lowell P. Weicker Jr. , 79, and Hall of Fame
baseball player  Hank Aaron , 76, has seen its stock drop 36
percent through yesterday from its price of $11 in its May 1996
initial public offering, excluding dividends.  
 Medallion has gained about 21 percent including reinvested
dividends from the end of May 1996 through last month,  monthly
data  compiled by Bloomberg show. The S&P 500 Index more than
doubled during the same period.
