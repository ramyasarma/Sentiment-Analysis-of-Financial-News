             Volkswagen AG’s  Audi luxury unit said
deliveries rose 7.7 percent in July as demand from China and the
U.S. boosted sales to record levels in both regions.  
 Deliveries increased to 91,400 cars and sport-utility
vehicles last month from 84,853 a year earlier, Ingolstadt,
Germany-based Audi said today in an e-mailed statement. Seven-
month sales gained 17 percent or 646,300 units,  
 “In July we more than tripled sales of our imported models
in China,” sales chief  Peter Schwarzenbauer  said in the
statement. Chinese sales surged 53 percent to 20,537 vehicles
while U.S. deliveries increased 22 percent to 7,817 units.  
 Audi has a goal of dethroning  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG 
as the world’s largest maker of luxury cars by 2015. Audi is
targeting record sales of more than 1.08 million vehicles this
year, an increase of 14 percent from 2009. Audi’s forecast
compares with a target to increase sales 10 percent at  BMW  and
Mercedes-Benz’s plan to outpace market growth of 4 percent.  
 The VW division is targeting a  return on capital  in 2020 of
more than 18 percent and a pretax profit margin of more than 8
percent of sales, the company said on May 20. Audi contributed
1.33 billion euros to Volkswagen’s first-half group operating
profit of 2.84 billion euros.  
 Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen , Europe’s biggest
carmaker, aims to overtake Toyota Motor Corp. in deliveries and
profitability by 2018, and it’s targeting a second consecutive
year of record sales in 2010.
