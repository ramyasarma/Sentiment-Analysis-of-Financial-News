             Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a letter to a U.S. lawmaker that he sees
several different options for replacing Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac and eliminating the risks they posed to financial markets.  
 “There are a variety of organizational forms that might
replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that could likely provide
mortgage credit without the systemic risks associated with these
institutions in the past,” Bernanke said in a July 23 letter to
Representative  Marcy Kaptur , a Democrat from Ohio.  
 The Fed chairman in July 22 testimony said he sees an
option to “to break up and privatize the companies, perhaps
supported by a government insurance program for their mortgages
that they would pay for.” Alternatively, the government could
“make them more like government utilities,” he said  
 The Treasury seized  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac in 2008 as
souring subprime loans pushed the companies toward collapse. The
two firms own or guarantee more than half the $11 trillion
mortgage market.  
 The government should ensure “accurate, transparent and
risk-based pricing of government guarantees,” Bernanke said in
the letter, which was released by Kaptur’s office.  
 Bernanke said in testimony last month that the current
status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac isn’t viable. “It’s not
sustainable, obviously,” he said.  
 To support the housing market and banks, the Fed has
purchased $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities.
