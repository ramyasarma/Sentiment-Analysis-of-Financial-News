             Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. , North
America’s largest iron-ore producer, said “difficult mining
conditions” at the Pinnacle coal mine in West Virginia have
temporarily forced production to halt.  
 The “tough mining” will affect the company’s ability to
fulfill customer order requirements for August,  Steve Baisden , a
company spokesman, said today in a telephone interview. The mine
will restart production “within the next few days,” he said.  
 “This is in no way a safety issue,” Baisden said. There
were no accidents or injuries in the mine, he said.  
 The company is maintaining its 2010 coal-production
forecast for North America of 3.4 million tons, Baisden said.
Pinnacle Mine, located in Pineville, West Virginia, produced
864,000 tons of  metallurgical  coal in 2009, according to the
company’s website.  
 Cliffs fell $1.60, or 2.6 percent, to $60.03 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  have gained 30
percent this year.
