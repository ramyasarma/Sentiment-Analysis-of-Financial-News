             Copper fell for the second straight
day after payroll data added to signs of fragile economic growth
in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest metal user.  
 Companies added fewer jobs in July than economists
projected, and overall employment fell more than forecast,
government data showed today. The unemployment rate was
unchanged at 9.5 percent. Global refined-copper demand fell 3.2
percent in April from March, according to the International
Copper Study Group.  
 “Metal demand should continue to disappoint,” said  David Thurtell , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London. The jobs
report “just says that the recovery remains a weak one,” he
said.  
 Copper futures for September delivery fell 1.05 cents, or
0.3 percent, to close at $3.343 a pound at 1:25 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Yesterday, the price dropped 1.5 percent
after reaching a three-month high of $3.4105 on Aug. 4.  
 Weaker-than-forecast growth in private payrolls is
“leading to a slower recovery,” said  Phil Streible , a senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “I
don’t expect to see a massive amount of growth coming out of
Europe either.”  
 Copper may fall to $3 in the next month, Streible said.
China is the world’s largest consumer.  
 The metal, up 1 percent this week, has climbed 21 percent
in the past year.  
 On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slipped $29, or 0.4 percent, to $7,370 a metric ton
($3.34 a pound).  
 Aluminum and lead also declined in London. Zinc, nickel,
and tin climbed.
