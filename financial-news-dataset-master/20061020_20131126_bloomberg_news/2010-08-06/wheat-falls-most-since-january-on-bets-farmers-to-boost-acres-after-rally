             (Corrects month of wheat contract in fourth paragraph)  
 Wheat futures fell the most since
mid-2009 on speculation that farmers will boost acreage next
year after prices surged to a 23-month high following Russia’s
ban on grain exports.  
 U.S. wheat yesterday traded at the highest premium over
corn since April 2008 at export terminals in New Orleans,
government data show. NYSE Liffe said the volume on its milling-
wheat futures reached a record 74,729 contracts yesterday, when
trading in Chicago was more than double the 30-day average.  
 “Buyers are not going to chase this rally, and farmers are
going to plant a lot more wheat,” said  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “All of the
volume indicators signal that yesterday may have been a buying
exhaustion.”  
 Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 60 cents, or
7.4 percent, to close at $7.5525 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The decline was the most allowed by the
exchange and the biggest for a most-active contract since June
3, 2009. For the week, the contract jumped 8.9 percent.  
 The price limit will expand to 90 cents when trading
resumes at 6 p.m. on Aug. 8, after the first three contracts
closed down the daily limit today,  Mary Haffenberg , a
spokeswoman for the CME Group Inc. said in an e-mail.  
 Price Doubles  
 Earlier, wheat reached $8.68, the highest level since Aug.
26, 2008. That was more than double this year’s low of $4.255 on
June 9. The most-severe drought in at least 50 years slashed
output in Russia, and adverse weather in Canada, Ukraine and the
European Union hurt crops.  
 Russia yesterday announced a ban on outbound grain
shipments from Aug. 15 until Dec. 31 to contain domestic prices
after drought wiped out crops in the country, the third-largest
wheat grower last year. Russia exported 17.4 million metric tons
in the year to June 30, the national customs service said today.  
 Kazakhstan doesn’t plan to follow its neighbor in
prohibiting exports, the Novosti-Kazakhstan news service said,
citing Yevgeny Aman, an Agriculture Ministry official.  
 “What Russia lacks in grain supplies to export, the U.S.
and Southern Hemisphere will pick up,” said  Terry Reilly , a
market analyst for Citigroup Global Markets in Chicago. “Russia
will eventually lift the ban once they have a better handle on
domestic supplies.”  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
