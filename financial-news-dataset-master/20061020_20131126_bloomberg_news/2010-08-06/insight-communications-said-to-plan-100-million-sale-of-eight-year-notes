             Insight Communications Co. plans to
sell $100 million of eight-year notes in a reopening of an
earlier offering, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who declined to be identified because terms aren’t
set.  
 The New York-based cable television operator sold $400
million of the debt on June 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.
