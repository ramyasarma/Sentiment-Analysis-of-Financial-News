             Catlin Group Ltd. , owner of the
largest insurance unit at Lloyd’s of London, said first-half
profit tumbled 64 percent, missing analysts’ estimates, because
of a foreign-exchange loss and higher catastrophe claims.  
 Pretax profit declined to $86 million in the six months to
June 30 from $240 million a year earlier, the Bermuda-based
company said today in a statement. That missed the $148 million
median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
income fell 71 percent to $57 million.  
 Catlin, which insures property against natural disasters,
terrorism and accidental damage, has been hurt this year by $140
million of losses from February’s earthquake in Chile and $40
million of claims related to the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion
in the Gulf Mexico.  
 “Our profits were reduced by record first-half catastrophe
losses and adverse foreign-exchange movements,” Chief Executive
Officer  Stephen Catlin  said in the statement. “Our results were
also impacted by the Deepwater Horizon loss.”  
 The stock dropped 2.6 pence, or 0.7 percent, to 385.4 pence
at 8:07 a.m. in London trading, valuing the firm at about 1.4
billion pounds ($2.2 billion).  
 Catlin’s earnings included a $49 million loss on foreign
exchange, of which $8 million has been “realized,” the company
said. Claims rose 30 percent to $1.02 billion.  
 Dividend  
 Catlin raised its half-year dividend 5 percent to 8.6 pence
a share, beating the analysts’ estimate of 8.3 pence. Investors
who choose to receive the payment in U.S. dollars will get
13.7 cents a share, compared with 13.8 cents a year earlier,
because of movements in foreign exchange.  
 Catlin is increasing its dividend because it expects to
benefit from higher premium rates as a result of the Deepwater
Horizon explosion and the resulting oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico.  
 The insurer, which last year raised $290 million of extra
capital to write more policies, said in June it would open a
reinsurance division in Switzerland with about $1 billion of
reserves.
