             Mexico’s peso dropped for a second
day as payrolls for companies in the U.S., the nation’s largest
trading partner, rose less than forecast, signaling that the
recovery in the labor market will take more time.  
 The peso plunged 1 percent to 12.6898 per dollar at 12:27
p.m. New York time, from 12.5640 yesterday. The decline was the
biggest in three weeks. The drop erased the currency’s gain this
week.  
 “It’s no surprise to me that the peso will remain hostage
to headline news from the U.S.,” said  Maya Hernandez , a
currency strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York. “The
recovery in Mexico is dependent on the recovery in the U.S.”  
 U.S. companies added 71,000 jobs in July, less than the
median forecast for an increase of 90,000 jobs in a Bloomberg
survey. Overall employment fell 131,000 jobs. The U.S. purchases
about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bonds due in 2024 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.87 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.06 centavo to 128.47 centavos per peso.
