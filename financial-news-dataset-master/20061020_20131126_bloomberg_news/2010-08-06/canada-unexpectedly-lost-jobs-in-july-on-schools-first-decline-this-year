             Canada unexpectedly lost jobs in July
and the country’s unemployment rate increased because of a drop
in full-time jobs at schools and in the finance industry. The
currency and government bond yields declined.  
 Employment fell by 9,300 jobs in July, the first decline
this year, following a 93,200 increase in June, Statistics
Canada said today in Ottawa. The  jobless rate  rose to 8 percent,
from 7.9 percent. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted
12,500 new jobs and a jobless rate of 7.9 percent, according to
the median of 22 estimates.  
 Canada’s economic growth has probably slowed this quarter
to about half the pace in the first three months of the year
when low mortgage rates and temporary tax credits sparked
spending. The slowdown may prompt the central bank to reconsider
the pace at which it raises interest rates.  
 “This is consistent with the idea that OK, we’re somewhat
confident that the Bank of Canada is probably going to pause,”
said  David Watt , senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada, the nation’s biggest bank.  
 Canada’s economy grew at a 6.1 percent annualized first-
quarter pace. Growth is projected at 3 percent in the second
quarter and 2.8 percent in the third quarter, according to the
Bank of Canada. The economy “is recovering, although we aren’t
out of the woods yet,” Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  told
reporters yesterday in Ottawa.  
 Raised Rates  
 The Bank of Canada raised its key interest rate for the
second month in a row on July 20, to 0.75 percent, and Governor
 Mark Carney  said two days later that “elevated” economic risks
mean any further moves would be “weighed carefully.” The
bank’s policy makers next meet on Sept. 8.  
 Canada’s dollar fell from almost the highest level in three
months after the report. The currency declined 0.5 percent to
C$1.0221 per U.S. dollar at 8:57 a.m. One Canadian dollar buys
97.8 U.S. cents.  
 The yield on the two-year Canadian government note, among
the securities most sensitive to central bank interest rate
moves, declined to 1.47 percent, from 1.52 percent yesterday.  
 Canada’s economy has created 393,700 jobs since July 2009,
Statistics Canada said today.  
 Full-time  employment decreased by 139,000 in July,
Statistics Canada said, partly offset by a 129,700 increase in
part-time jobs. Employment in educational services fell 65,300,
and jobs in finance, insurance, real estate and leasing were
down 29,800.  
 Jobs in public administration were up by 18,700.  
 Average hourly wages  rose  2.2 percent in July from a year
ago, up from an annual pace of 1.7 percent in June.  
 Payroll employment fell by 5,200 in July, and self-
employment dropped 4,200, the agency said.
