             Polish yields will likely drop to the
lowest since April as the government reduces its offering of
bonds while investors continue to show strong demand for the
country’s debt, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co.   
 Investors should buy two-year Polish government notes as
the yield will probably drop to 4.50 percent from 4.78
yesterday, JPMorgan analyst  Mike Trounce  in London wrote in a
research note dated yesterday. The zloty may appreciate to 3.82
per euro, the strongest since December 2008, from 3.99
yesterday, he wrote.  
 Poland plans to offer less domestic debt in August than in
any month so far this year after covering 70 percent of its 2010
funding needs, the Finance Ministry said on July 30. The yield
on the Polish two-year bond has not been below 4.5 percent since
April 22, when Moody’s Investors Service cut Greece’s sovereign
rating by one level, prompting investors to shun east European
assets on concern the debt crisis might spread to other parts of
the continent.  
 “The bond supply pipeline is starting to dry up, yet
demand remains strong,” Trounce wrote in the note. “Poland
will continue to be favored by emerging-market funds with a need
to allocate part of their inflows to the Europe, Middle East and
Africa region. This will help support the zloty.”  
 The Finance Ministry sold a combined 7.2 billion zloty
($2.38 billion) of two- and five-year bonds on Aug. 5 in two
auctions that attracted bids worth 12.5 billion zloty.
