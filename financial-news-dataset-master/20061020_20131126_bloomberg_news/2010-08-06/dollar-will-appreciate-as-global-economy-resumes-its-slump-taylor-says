             The U.S. dollar will strengthen when
the global economy slips back into recession, according to  John Taylor , who oversees $7.5 billion at FX Concepts LLC, manager of
the world’s largest currency hedge fund.  
 “The dollar will be weak, but only for another couple of
weeks -- then it’s going to turn around,” Taylor, 67, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. Because most global debt is
dollar-denominated, when economic conditions weaken and U.S.
banks cut back on lending, international banks scramble for the
greenback and boost its value, he said.  
 “The catalyst for the turnaround is things get much
worse,” said New York-based Taylor. “The banks aren’t nervous
now, but they’re going to be nervous when the economy starts to
roll over in the third and fourth quarter.”  
 The euro will peak between $1.32 and $1.35, he said. The
euro climbed 0.8 percent to $1.3296, the highest level since May
3, at 10:53 a.m. in New York.  
 “We haven’t sold it yet -- we still own it,” he said. “I
wouldn’t be surprised to see it peaked out here today, right
here. It’s not going to go much further than this. On the other
side going down, it’s a little early to say how far it’s going
to go, but $1 to 1.10 is very realistic.”  
 ‘Goldilocks’ Number  
 A government report today showed companies in the U.S.
added workers in July at a pace that suggests the labor-market
recovery will be slow to take hold.  
 Private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose by
71,000 after a June gain of 31,000 that was smaller than
previously reported, Labor Department figures in Washington
showed today. Economists projected a 90,000 July increase,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Overall employment fell 131,000 and  unemployment  held at 9.5
percent.  
 “It was a bad number, but not so bad as to cause a
crisis,” Taylor said. “It’s a Goldilocks number for the
Europeans and the rest of the world, because it means the U.S.
will keep interest rates low and money will flow out of the U.S.
and they’ll be able to grow.”  
 The weak dollar hurts European exporters, Taylor said, as
the euro zone tries to recover from slumping bonds from
peripheral nations during the first half of the year. The  Greek
10-year yield  surged to a record of more than 12 percent this
year due to speculation the countries would struggle to finance
their debt.  
 The losses forced a European Union and International
Monetary Fund bailout, including the purchase of securities by
the European Central Bank. Taylor said Greece will default,
followed by Spain.  
 “As time goes on, we’re going to see the Greek numbers and
Spanish numbers look worse than we expected,” Taylor said.
