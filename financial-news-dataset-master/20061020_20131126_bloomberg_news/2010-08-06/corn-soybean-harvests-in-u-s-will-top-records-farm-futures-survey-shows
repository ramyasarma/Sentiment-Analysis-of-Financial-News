             U.S. farmers will reap more corn and
soybeans than ever after warm, wet weather in June and July
boosted yields, according to a survey by  Farm Futures magazine .  
 The corn harvest will total 13.47 billion bushels, 2.7
percent more than the record 13.11 billion harvested last year,
Farm Futures said in a press release after surveying more than
550 farmers from July 23 to Aug. 4. In July, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture estimated farmers would produce 13.245 billion.  
 Soybean production will rise 1.5 percent to 3.41 billion
bushels from a record 3.359 billion in 2009, Farm Futures said
in a statement.  
 The Agriculture Department is scheduled to update its crop
estimates on Sept. 11.
