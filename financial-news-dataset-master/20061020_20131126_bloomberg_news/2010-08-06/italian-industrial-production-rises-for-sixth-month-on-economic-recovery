             Italian industrial production rose in
June for a sixth month as the recovery from the country’s worst
recession in six decades advanced.  
 Production climbed 0.6 percent from May, when it rose 1
percent, Rome-based national statistics institute Istat said
today in a report. That was less than the 0.7 percent median
forecast by 18 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Output
rose 8.1 percent in June from a year earlier, Istat said.
