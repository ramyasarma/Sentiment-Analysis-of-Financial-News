             Ford Motor Co.  Executive Chairman
 Bill Ford , great grandson of company founder  Henry Ford , sold
3.5 million shares of common stock for total proceeds of $28.4
million, the company said in a regulatory  filing  today.  
 Bill Ford sold some of the shares to pay down personal debt
he took on in 2005, when he acquired options for stock to show
his faith in the company’s future. He sold about half of the 3.5
million shares for $22.7 million. The other 1.77 million shares
were options he exercised and sold for $23 million, netting $5.7
million.  
 The board’s compensation committee voted to release $4.2
million of salary from the past two years and seven months that
had been deferred until the company’s automotive operations were
profitable, said  Mark Truby , a spokesman. Now Bill Ford is
cashing in some of his equity holdings to draw some cash.  
 “Don’t forget that the company hasn’t been paying
dividends,” said  Joe Phillippi , principal of AutoTrends Inc., a
consulting firm in Short Hills, New Jersey. “It’s not
surprising that he wanted to take a little money off the
table.”  
 In 2005, when company profits were sinking, Bill Ford told
employees that he would forgo any compensation until the company
returned to profitability. He then personally borrowed money to
buy about $14 million in stock options.  
 Profits Back  
 Ford Motor made $2.7 billion last year and $4.7 billion in
the first half of this year, its most profitable first half in
more than a decade. It had lost $30.1 billion from 2006 through
2008.  
 Ford  rose  6 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $13.04 a share at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have gained 30 percent this year.  
 Bill Ford wrote in a note sent to employees today that the
compensation committee for Ford’s board decided that the company
was profitable enough to reinstate his pay.  
 Separately, Bill Ford donated $1 million in stock to the
William Clay Ford Jr. Scholarship Program, according to the
filing.  
 He also traded 750,000 shares of  common stock  for Class B
super-voting shares held by the Ford family, which maintains 40
percent of the vote.  
 Separately,  Edsel Ford , a director and cousin of Bill Ford,
sold 179,000 Class A shares worth $2.34 million, the company
said in another filing.
