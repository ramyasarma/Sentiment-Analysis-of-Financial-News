             Valley Meat Co., a Modesto-California
based processor, is recalling about 1 million pounds (454 metric
tons) of ground beef that may be contaminated with E. coli, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said.  
 Seven people may have been sickened by a “rare strain” of
the bacteria after eating the meat, the USDA’s Food Safety and
Inspection Service said today on its  website . The beef was
produced between early October and mid-January, and the USDA is
“concerned that some product may still be frozen and in
consumers’ freezers,” the agency said.  
 The meat was distributed to grocery stores and food-service
companies in California, Texas, Oregon, Arizona and
internationally, the USDA said.  
 The recall was the first in Valley Meat’s 50-year history,
according to a  statement  on the company’s website.  
 “We will investigate the matter thoroughly and take any
measures deemed necessary to further elevate our safety
standards, protect consumers and ensure confidence in our
products,” the company said.  
 E. coli is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause
dehydration and, in the most severe cases, kidney failure,
according to the USDA. The very young, seniors and people with
weak immune systems are the most susceptible to food-borne
illness.
