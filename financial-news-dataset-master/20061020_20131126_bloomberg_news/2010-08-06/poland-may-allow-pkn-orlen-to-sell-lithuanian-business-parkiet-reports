             Poland may allow state-controlled  PKN
Orlen SA , the country’s biggest refiner, to sell Orlen Lietuva,
its Lithuanian unit, Deputy Treasury Minister  Mikolaj Budzanowski  told  Parkiet .  
 Further actions and “ownership decisions” must be
considered and the priority is to return Lietuva to profit, the
newspaper cited Budzanowski as saying.  
 Lithuania won’t be able to rebuild a stretch of railway, to
shorten Orlen Lietuva’s fuel transport routes to Latvia, by
September, as the Polish government had hoped, Parkiet added.
