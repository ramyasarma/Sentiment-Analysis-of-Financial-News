             Washington Post Co.  fell the most in
more than a year after saying proposed U.S. Department of
Education rules could “have a material adverse effect” on its
Kaplan unit, which makes up more than 60 percent of earnings.  
 The Washington-based company plunged $31.05, or 7.6
percent, to $377.56 at 4:11 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading , for the largest one-day drop since May 1,
2009. Post Co., down 14 percent this year, is at its lowest
since July 17, 2009.  
 The company said it could lose out on revenue if the
Department of Education tightens restrictions on federal
education grant and loan programs. President  Barack Obama ’s
administration is considering increased regulation out of
concern recruiters working for for-profit colleges are signing
up unqualified students and leaving them with loans they may be
unable to repay.  
 Kaplan operates Kaplan University, which offers degree
programs online and on campuses, in addition to test-preparation
courses for entry exams such as the LSAT for law degrees and
GMAT for business programs. The proposed rules could cause Post
Co. to lose some Kaplan admissions and financial aid advisers
and may limit financial aid for some students, the company said
in a statement today as it reported financial results.  
 Post Co. reported an 11 percent increase in revenue to $1.2
billion in the second quarter as net income rose to $92.1
million from $12.5 million a year earlier, in part because of
the  Kaplan  education business. The unit posted an 88 percent
jump in operating profit in the quarter to $109 million, on a 15
percent increase in revenue.  
 Post Co.’s newspaper division, which includes the namesake
newspaper and the  Herald  of Everett, Washington, reported its
losses narrowed to $14.3 million from $89.3 million.  
 Washington Post said it expects to close the sale of its
Newsweek magazine in the third quarter. The 74-year-old magazine
will be sold to  Sidney Harman , the founder of Harman
International Industries Inc. for an undisclosed sum.
