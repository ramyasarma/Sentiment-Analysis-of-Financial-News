             Gold futures rose, extending the
longest rally since November, as the dollar dropped against the
euro, boosting the appeal of the precious metal as an
alternative asset.  
 The greenback fell as much as 1.1 percent after a payroll
report signaled the U.S. will be slow in recouping jobs lost in
the recession. Gold reached a three-week high. The metal has
advanced 10 percent this year, climbing to a record $1,266.50 an
ounce on June 21.  
 “The dollar is getting odious compared to the euro, which
was the rankest thing around in the first half of this year,”
said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services LLC in Chicago. “If the Fed has to do something more
accommodative to spur the economy, you’re going to see an
explosive rally in gold.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery rose $6, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $1,205.30 at 2:04 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The metal climbed for the eighth straight session, the longest
rally since November. Earlier, the price reached $1,213.30, the
highest level for a most-active contract since July 15.  
 Today, the euro rose to a three-month high against the
dollar. This week, gold gained 1.8 percent, ending a three-week
slide.  
 Payrolls that exclude government agencies rose by 71,000
after a June gain of 31,000 that was smaller than reported,
Labor Department figures showed. Economists projected a 90,000
July increase, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. Overall, employment fell 131,000, and the jobless
rate was unchanged at 9.5 percent.  
 ‘Flee the Dollar’  
 “It is now widely accepted that the continued domestic
weakness will cause the Fed to significantly expand stimulus
efforts through so-called quantitative easing,”  Peter Schiff ,
the president of Euro Pacific Capital in Darien, Connecticut,
said in a report. “It’s a strong signal for traders to flee the
dollar.”  
 The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to revive the
economy. The European Central Bank yesterday kept its main rate
at 1 percent. The Fed’s next decision on interest rates is Aug.
10.  
 Gold priced in euros also reached a record in June amid
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. The metal has historically moved
in tandem with the euro as an alternative to the dollar.  
 “The positive correlation of gold prices to the euro is
re-establishing itself,” Deutsche Bank AG said in a report.
“Given our bearish outlook for the dollar, we believe this will
trigger further gains in the gold price.”  
 The bank forecast gold will average $1,275 in the third
quarter.  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 15.1 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $18.472 an ounce on the Comex. The metal gained
2.6 percent this week.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell $1.70, or 0.1
percent, to $1,570.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The metal dropped 0.4 percent this week.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery declined $8.45, or
1.7 percent, to $487.60 an ounce, down 2.5 percent this week.
