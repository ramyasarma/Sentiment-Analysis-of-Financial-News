             Venezuela plans to sell $3 billion of
bonds in the local market next week after its benchmark dollar
borrowing costs fell to the lowest in almost three months,
according to a Finance Ministry official.  
 Investors will be able to buy the dollar-denominated bonds
due in 2022 with bolivars, said the official, who declined to be
identified because he isn’t authorized to speak publicly. The
government’s  average dollar bond yield  has plunged 318 basis
points, or 3.18 percentage points, to 13.03 percent from a one-
year high of 16.21 percent on June 8, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. indexes.  
 President  Hugo Chavez  last sold dollar bonds in the local
market in October, when his administration issued $5 billion of
securities as part of an effort to bolster the supply of dollar-
based assets in the economy and shore up the bolivar.  
 “The only thing that I can say is that financial
conditions are good for a sale,”  Armando Leon , a central bank
board director, said in an interview today in Caracas. “Because
the Finance Ministry has been paying down debt since last year,
there’s space to sell debt in foreign currency or in bolivars.”  
 Leon declined to comment on any specific sale plans.  
 Concern the sale will create a bond supply glut sparked a
rout in Venezuelan dollar debt today, stemming the two-month
rally. Yields on the government’s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds
maturing in 2027 jumped 37 basis points, the most in a month, to
13.18 percent at 3:50 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. The bond’s price sank 2 cents on the dollar to 73.8
cents.  
 ‘Bad Experiences’  
 Investors worry that Venezuela will flood the market with
debt after it boosted October’s sale 60 percent from an initial
$3 billion and after state oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA 
increased its offering in 2007 to $7.5 billion, according to
 Alejandro Grisanti , an economist at Barclays Plc in New York.  
 While the government issues the bonds in the local market,
Venezuelans re-sell the securities overseas, swelling the amount
of debt owned by foreigners, to obtain dollars and circumvent
Chavez’s currency controls.  
 “There’s always fear of new supply in Venezuela because of
bad experiences in the past,” Grisanti said. “The net supply
will be digestible as investors understand that what is coming
down the pipeline is relatively small.”  
 The government is scheduled to pay $1.5 billion on bonds
maturing tomorrow, meaning next week’s offering will result in a
net sale of $1.5 billion, Grisanti said.
