             Cotton rose, capping the third
straight weekly gain, as export demand surged and inventories
dwindled in the U.S., the world’s largest shipper. Orange-juice
futures dropped.  
 U.S. exporters have booked sales of 3.506 million running
bales of upland cotton for the year that started Aug. 1, more
than doubling shipments from a year earlier,  government data 
show. A running bale weighs 500 pounds, or 227 kilograms.
 Stockpiles  monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have plunged 93 percent
this year.  
 “The demand for cotton is reaching an insatiable level,”
said  Keith Brown , the president of Keith Brown & Co., a
brokerage in Moultrie, Georgia. “I’ve had my largest gin
clients called by cotton agents in Indonesia and China looking
for big buys of cotton. They just can’t find it.”  
 Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.17 cent, or 0.2
percent, to close at 80.23 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE in
New York. The price gained 1.9 percent this week and was up 32
percent in the past year. Yesterday, the fiber reached 81.78
cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since May
27.  
 Amid the rally in wheat, corn and soybeans this week,
cotton has “bullish fundamentals in its own right,” Brown
said.  
 This week, wheat jumped to a 23-month high after Russia
halted grain exports, driving corn and soybeans higher. Today,
wheat tumbled on bets that farmers will boost global acreage.  
 In cotton, “if we can close over 80 cents, the more the
merrier,” Brown said. “We are decoupling ourselves from
wheat.”  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery fell 1.95
cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $1.44 a pound in New York.
Earlier, the price touched 1.4345, the lowest level since July
26. This week, the commodity dropped 1.8 percent, snapping a
three-week rally.
