             Baseball player  Barry Bonds’s 
criminal trial over whether he lied about using performance-
enhancing drugs will start March 21, a federal judge said.  
 U.S. District Judge  Susan Illston  in San Francisco set the
trial date today. The former San Francisco Giants outfielder is
charged with obstruction and lying to a federal grand jury in
2003 when he said he never knowingly took performance-enhancing
drugs.  
 Bonds, who broke  Hank Aaron’s  record of 755 career home
runs in August 2007, won a ruling last month that delayed his
perjury trial.  
 An appeals court upheld Illston’s decision that positive
drug-test results that prosecutors said were for Bonds and
statements by his trainer can’t be used as evidence against him
at trial.  
 The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco).
