             Brazilian stocks dependent on
consumer spending are attractive because concern economic growth
will slow enough to damp their  earnings  is “greatly overstated,”
Itau Unibanco Holding SA said.  
 “The perception that the Brazilian economy could be
rapidly cooling down has started to gain some ground,” analysts
led by  Carlos Constantini  wrote in a note to clients distributed
by e-mail today. “This perception has obviously translated into
overhang and share price weakness. The honeymoon with domestic
stocks appears to be over. We believe this position has been
greatly overstated.”  
 Industrial production slowed for three straight months,
with output falling the most since 2008 in June from a month
earlier, the national statistics agency said Aug. 3. The economy
still remains “robust,” Itau said. Gross domestic product
expanded at a 9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the
fastest pace since 1995.  
 “If anything, investors should be concerned about the
overheating, not the cool down,” the analysts wrote.
“Domestic-related stories continue to offer good investment
alternatives.”  
 Itau has “outperform” ratings on stocks including  Lojas
Renner SA , Brazil’s biggest publicly traded clothing retailer,
and Blumenau-based apparel maker Cia. Hering, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The declines in industrial production in the second quarter
owe in part to the Easter holiday falling in March and reduced
activity because of the World Cup soccer tournament, Itau said.
