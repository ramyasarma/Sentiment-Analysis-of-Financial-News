             Lojas Americanas SA , Brazil’s biggest
discount retailer, said second-quarter profit jumped more than
fourfold as spending grew in Latin America’s largest economy.  
 Net income rose to 28.6 million reais ($16.3 million) from
6.1 million reais a year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said late yesterday in a  regulatory filing . The  average
estimate  for profit excluding some items was 11.9 million reais
in a Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts. Net sales climbed 7
percent to 2.17 billion reais.  
 Brazilian retail sales rose 10.2 percent in May from a year
earlier, helping the economy post the biggest expansion in more
than two decades. Lojas Americanas announced plans in November
to open 400 new stores in Brazil between 2010 and 2013.  
 Lojas’s progress with its expansion project in the second
half of the year will influence the company’s valuation more
than its sales performance,  Renato Prado , an analyst at Fator
Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview. He has a
“ buy’ ’ recommendation on the stock.  
 Brazil’s  gross domestic product  is expected to grow 7.2
percent this year, according to a central bank survey published
Aug. 2.  
 Net income at Lojas unit  B2W Cia. Global de Varejo , the
country’s largest online retailer, fell 67 percent to 5 million
reais in the quarter, according to a  separate statement  on its
website.  
 Lojas Americanas  declined 0.2 percent to close at 14.72
reais yesterday in Sao Paulo trading before the results were
released. The shares have dropped 5.2 percent this year,
compared with a 0.3 percent decline in the benchmark  Bovespa 
index.
