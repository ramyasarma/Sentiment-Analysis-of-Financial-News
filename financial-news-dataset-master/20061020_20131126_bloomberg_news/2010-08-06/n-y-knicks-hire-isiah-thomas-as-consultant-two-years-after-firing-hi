             Isiah Thomas , who in 2008 was
fired as coach and president of the New York Knicks, has
been re-hired as a consultant to the National Basketball
Association team.  
 Thomas, 49, will “assist the team’s senior management
in various capacities, including player recruitment,” the
team said today in a news release. Thomas will remain coach
of Florida International University, where he has worked
since April 2009.  
 “Isiah Thomas brings unique experience as a Hall of
Fame player, coach, executive and owner, and we believe
having him as part of our organization will be extremely
beneficial to the team’s success,” team owner  James Dolan 
and President  Donnie Walsh  said in a joint statement.  
 The Knicks failed to produce a winning season in the
four years Thomas was in control of the team, including the
final two in which he was also its coach. He was relieved
of his duties as team president in April 2008 and fired as
coach later that month after the team tied a franchise
record for defeats in a season.  
 He was replaced by Walsh as president and  Mike D’Antoni  as head coach. The Knicks went 32-50 the following
season and 29-53 in 2009-2010 as they shed salary-cap space
to make an attempt to sign free-agent  LeBron James  and
other top players this summer.  
 Thomas was asked to be part of the group that tried to
convince James to join the Knicks. James instead chose the
Miami Heat, though free-agent All-Star  Amar’e Stoudemire 
did opt to move from the Phoenix Suns to New York. Walsh
thanked Thomas at Stoudemire’s introductory news
conference, drawing speculation Thomas might return to the
team.  
 Thomas’s ‘Skill Set’  
 “I was honored to have been asked to help during the
recent free-agent recruiting process, and believe that this
new role takes full advantage of my skill set as an
evaluator of basketball talent,” Thomas said in a
statement released by the Knicks.  
 Thomas’s tenure was marked by a sexual harassment suit
against him by a team executive and a high-profile feud
with his top player, former All-Star point guard  Stephon Marbury .  
 Thomas retired as an NBA player in 1994 after 13
seasons with the Detroit Pistons. He was inducted into the
Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000.
