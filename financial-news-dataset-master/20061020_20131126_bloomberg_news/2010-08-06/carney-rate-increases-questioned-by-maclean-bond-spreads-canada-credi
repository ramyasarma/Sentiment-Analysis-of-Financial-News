             The outlook for further interest-rate
increases in Canada is being questioned by the bond market,
where yields on two-year securities fell this week to the lowest
relative to the central bank’s benchmark since April 2009.  
 The  difference  between the Bank of Canada’s target rate of
0.75 percent and the yield on the two-year bonds shrank to 0.69
percentage point on Aug. 3, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s down from the high this year of 1.80
percentage points in April, just before policy makers began
boosting rates from 0.25 percent.  
 A shrinking in the gap typically signals that debt
investors doubt borrowing costs will rise much more. Otherwise,
they would demand more in yield to own fixed-income securities.
Bond holders are concerned that Canada’s economy may not be able
to withstand the slowdown in the U.S., its largest trading
partner.  
 “The Bank of Canada is done for now,” said  Ric Palombi , a
money manager in Calgary at McLean & Partners, which oversees
more than C$1 billion ($983 million). “They did what they had
to do” and will wait to get a clearer picture of U.S. growth,
he said.  
 Employment  fell by 9,300 jobs in July, the first decline
this year, following a 93,200 increase in June, Statistics
Canada said today in Ottawa. The jobless rate rose to 8 percent,
from 7.9 percent. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted
12,500 new jobs and a jobless rate of 7.9 percent, according to
the median of 22 estimates.  
 Corporate Bonds  
 Elsewhere in Canada’s credit markets, the extra yield
investors demand to own the nation’s corporate bonds rather than
federal government debt was unchanged yesterday at 147 basis
points, after falling from 152 basis points at the end of July,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The spread
has ranged from 114 basis points, or 1.14 percentage point, in
March to 154 in June. Yields average 3.96 percent, down from
3.99 percent on Aug. 4 and the same level at the end of July  
 Spreads on provincial debt are poised to narrow for the
week, ending yesterday at 59 basis points, compared with 61 on
July 30.  
 Longer-term government bonds advanced, driving the yield on
the benchmark 10-year note down 5 basis points to 3.11 percent.
It touched 3.055 percent two days ago, the lowest since May
2009. The 3.5 percent security due in June 2020 climbed 43 cents
to C$103.29.  
 Falling Yields  
 The yield on the two-year bond fell to 1.46 percent after
the jobs report, compared with 1.58 percent on July 20. That was
the day the Bank of Canada and Governor  Mark Carney  raised their
target rate for overnight loans between commercial banks to 0.75
percent from 0.5 percent.  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, fell 1 percent
to C$1.0275 per U.S. dollar at 10:54 a.m. in Toronto, from
C$1.0168 yesterday, when it touched C$1.0108, the strongest
since May 4. One Canadian dollar purchases 97.32 U.S. cents.  
 Bank of Canada policy makers next meet Sept. 8. The yield
on the June 2011 bankers’ acceptance futures contract fell 6
basis points today to 1.55 percent.  
 Carney predicted that Canada’s inflation rate will remain
at about the bank’s 2 percent target by the fourth quarter of
2011 and that the economy will grow at an annualized pace of 2.8
percent or more until at least next year’s third quarter. That
is less than the bank’s previous estimate.  
 Growth will be strong enough to prod policy makers to raise
rates twice more this year, to 1.25 percent, said  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
in Toronto.  
 ‘More Room’  
 “Investors are right in assuming that the Bank of Canada
can’t keep going it alone with interest rate hikes while the Fed
is on hold, but I think the bank has more room to do that than
investors are allowing for,” said Shenfeld, who predicts the
bank won’t pause until December.  
 The U.S. Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark lending
rate between zero and 0.25 percent since December 2008.  
 Rising commodity prices due to “relatively firm” growth
in emerging markets will allow Canada to set a more-independent
monetary policy from the U.S. than investors believe it has in
the past, said  Mark Chandler , head of Canadian fixed-income and
currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, the
nation’s largest lender.  
 He predicts the central bank will boost rates 0.25 point in
September, pause in October and resume increasing borrowing
costs until they reach 2.25 percent by mid-2011. That would
translate in a two-year bond yield of 2 percent at the end of
the year and 2.7 percent by June.  
 Favoring 3s, 5s  
 The shrinking spread between the Bank of Canada rate and
two-year bond yields contrasts with earlier this year, when it
expanded from 0.92 percentage point in January to 1.77
percentage points in mid-May as investors anticipated higher
borrowing costs. That was less than three weeks before policy
makers first increased rates.  
 McLean’s Palombi said while his funds own some two-year
bonds, he prefers three- and five-year debt because they have
higher yields and better fit his investment strategy.  
 Investors have priced in a 75 percent probability for a
0.25 percent increase at the central bank’s September meeting,
50 percent for October and 30 percent for December, according to
 Mohammed Ahmed , CIBC’s rate strategist.  
 Four of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect
the bank to move to 1.5 percent by year-end, one predicts 1.25
percent and one foresees 1 percent.  
 “There’s a clear divergence between the way the market is
behaving and the way most economists believe the Bank of Canada
will end up going,” Shenfeld said. “Economists are paying more
attention to the Canadian data, and investors, particularly
global investors, are hyper-focused on U.S. numbers.”  
 U.S. private payrolls that exclude government agencies rose
by 71,000 after a June gain of 31,000 that was smaller than
previously reported, Labor Department figures in Washington
showed today. Economists projected a 90,000 July increase,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Overall employment fell 131,000 and unemployment held at 9.5
percent.
