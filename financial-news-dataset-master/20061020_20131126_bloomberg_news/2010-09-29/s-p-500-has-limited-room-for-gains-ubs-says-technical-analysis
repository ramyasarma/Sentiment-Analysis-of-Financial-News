The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has
limited scope for further gains as it heads for the biggest
September rally since 1939 and may fall more than 4 percent if a
support level is breached, according UBS AG technical analysts.  Michael Riesner  and Marc Mueller wrote in a report dated
yesterday that the U.S. benchmark index could reach 1,165 before
the current advance ends, a 1.5 percent gain from the last
close. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent to 1,147.7 yesterday as
investors speculated the Federal Reserve will buy more debt to
safeguard the economy.  We “wouldn’t chase the market on a broader base, and if
so, we would apply a very tight money management, using last
week’s reaction low at 1,122 as a trigger to sell, short or
protect positions,” the Zurich-based analysts wrote.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 9.4 percent so far this month,
poised for its biggest September increase since 1939, as concern
eased that Europe’s debt crisis and U.S. unemployment will
derail the economic rebound. The gauge could fall to 1,100 if
the 1,122 low is breached, a 4.1 decline from yesterday’s close,
according to Riesner and Mueller.  “We continue to see the risk of the market correcting into
late October or early November, but given the current strong
rally this potential correction could be just another pullback
within the sideways trading range of the last few months,” the
analysts wrote. A correction is often defined as a decline of 10
percent or more.  Riesner and Mueller also said that the  VIX Index  “suggests
that the upside from here will be limited.” The VIX, as the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, has
lost 13 percent so far this month, erasing August’s 11 percent
surge. The index measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the S&P 500.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. UBS is ranked as the top bank for
equity technical analysis and charting according to a 2010
Thomson Extel survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
