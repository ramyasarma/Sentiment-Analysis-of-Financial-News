South African bonds rose, snapping
a three-day drop, after a report showed inflation in Africa’s
biggest economy eased for an eighth straight month, reducing the
erosive effect of rising prices on fixed-income securities.  The government’s 10.5 percent bond due December 2026 rose
22 cents to 124.07 rand, lowering the yield by 2 basis points to
7.845 percent by 4:18 p.m. in Johannesburg. The benchmark 13.5
percent security due September 2015 reversed earlier gains,
losing less than 2 cents to 125.88 rand leaving the yield little
changed at 7.19 percent.  Consumer inflation  in Africa’s biggest economy slowed to
3.5 percent in August, down from 3.7 percent the previous month,
the Pretoria-based statistics office said on its  website  today.
The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey was for an inflation
reading of 3.6 percent.  “It’s very good number and is a positive surprise for the
bond market,” said  Ian Scott , a bond and currency trader at
Stanlib Asset Management in Johannesburg. “The question of
whether there’ll be further rate cuts is still open to debate
but the fact that inflation is decelerating to a lower base is
always a good thing for bonds.”  South African borrowing costs have slumped as the rand’s 35
percent surge against the dollar since the start of last year
reduced the cost of imported oil. Easing price pressures and
slowing economic growth allowed Central Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points
to a record low of 6 percent on Sept. 9.  Cut Probability Raised  “We’re still seeing a sharp deceleration to the core
components of inflation, which can be attributed in large part
to the strength of the rand,” said  Jean-Francois Mercier , an
economist at Citigroup Inc. in Johannesburg. “If the rand keeps
strengthening the Reserve Bank might revise lower its inflation
outlook. Only then does the question of further rate cuts become
more valid.”  FRAs, or forward-rates agreements, showed money-market
investors added to bets the  Reserve Bank  will lower the main
interest rate for a ninth time since the end of 2008 when it
announces its next decision on Nov. 18. The cost of  three-month
contracts for cash in three months  fell 1 basis point from their
previous close to 5.88 percent, up from a record low of 5.87
percent on Sept. 27.  The rand traded little changed against the dollar at
6.9782, from a previous close of 6.9756. Against the euro, the
rand lost 0.2 percent to 9.4902.  To contact the reporter on this story:
