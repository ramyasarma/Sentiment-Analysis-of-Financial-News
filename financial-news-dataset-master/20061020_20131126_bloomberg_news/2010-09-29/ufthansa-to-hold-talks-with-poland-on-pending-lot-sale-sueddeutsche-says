Deutsche Lufthansa AG  will hold
talks with the Polish government over the sale of national
carrier Polskie Linie Lotnicze LOT SA to private investors,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing incoming Chief Executive
Officer  Christoph Franz .  Franz, who takes over from  Wolfgang Mayrhuber  on Jan. 1,
said the German company couldn’t “ignore” the pending sale and
that Poland needs a “strong airline” for its state-controlled
carrier, the newspaper reported. Lufthansa may also invest in a
west African airline, Franz told Sueddeutsche.  Franz said the company should aim for an operating-profit
margin of 8 percent in its passenger business, the newspaper
also reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
