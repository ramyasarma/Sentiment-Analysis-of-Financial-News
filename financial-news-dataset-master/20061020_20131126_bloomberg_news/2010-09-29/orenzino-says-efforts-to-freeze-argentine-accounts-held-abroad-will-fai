Argentina Finance Secretary Hernan
Lorenzino said that efforts by so-called vulture funds to freeze
Argentine accounts held abroad will fail after the country’s
recent bond swap.  Lorenzino, speaking in Buenos Aires, said that the vulture
funds own about $5 billion of the $6 billion that was held out
of the recent swap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
