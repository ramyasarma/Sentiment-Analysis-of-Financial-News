South African Labor Minister
 Membathisi Mdladlana  wants to raise the pay of labor inspectors
and provide them with bullet-proof vests due to the high-risk of
their work,  Beeld  reported, citing a speech.  Mdladlana said the inspectors face dangers including
farmers “who use them as targets,” the Johannesburg-based
Afrikaans-language newspaper quoted him as saying at a
conference jointly hosted by his department and the
International Labor Organization near Pretoria yesterday.  South Africa should also raise the 500,000 rand ($72,000)
fine for employers who refuse to pay workers the minimum wage of
450 rand per week, Beeld cited Mdladlana as saying. The
country’s labor department has about 400 vacant posts for
inspectors, Mdladlana said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
