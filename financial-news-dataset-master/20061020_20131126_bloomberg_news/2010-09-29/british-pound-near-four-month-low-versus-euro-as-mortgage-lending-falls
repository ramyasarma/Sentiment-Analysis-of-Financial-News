The pound was near the weakest in
more than four months against the euro as a report showed U.K.
mortgage lending fell for a fourth month in August, adding to
signs the recovery is faltering.  The British currency slipped for a second day versus the
yen. Lenders granted 47,372 loans to buy homes, compared with a
revised 48,346 in July, the Bank of England said today in
London. Economists forecast that approvals would decrease to
47,000 from an initially reported 48,700 in July. The British
currency was close to its strongest versus the dollar in six
weeks on speculation the Federal Reserve will loosen monetary
policy to shore up growth.  “Sterling has underperformed most major currencies except
for the dollar as people worry about falling house prices and
forthcoming austerity,” said  Michael Derks , chief strategist at
FXPro Financial Services Ltd. in London. “The pound could stay
weaker for a while yet.”  The pound was 0.3 percent weaker at 86.25 pence per euro as
of 5 p.m. in London after reaching 86.31 pence, the weakest
since May 24. Sterling was little changed at $1.5809 and dropped
0.3 percent to 132.12 yen.  U.K. government bonds rose, with the yield on the 10-year
gilt 3 basis points lower at 2.91 percent. The 4.75 percent
security due March 2020 climbed 0.225, or 2.25 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 115.065. Two-year yields fell 2 basis
points to 0.63 percent.  Gilts lost 0.6 percent this month, trimming their quarterly
return to 3.8 percent, according to indexes compiled by Bank of
America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit. German government bonds
earned 2.3 percent this quarter, while U.S. Treasuries returned
2.9 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
