European Central Bank council
member Axel Weber said it’s important that global regulators
coordinate efforts to oversee the financial system.   “It’s very important that practices of supervisors are
converging,” Weber, who is also head of Germany’s Bundesbank,
said at a conference in Brussels today. “We should keep a firm
focus on the fact that Europe isn’t an island. We’re embedded in
global financial markets.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
