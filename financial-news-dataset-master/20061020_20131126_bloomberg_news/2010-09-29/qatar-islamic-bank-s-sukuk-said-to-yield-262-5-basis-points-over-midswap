Qatar Islamic Bank SAQ  may raise as
much as $750 million by selling five-year Islamic bonds that may
be priced to yield 262.5 basis points above similar maturity
midswap, four bankers familiar with the transaction said.  The bankers declined to be identified because the deal
hasn’t been completed.  “The demand for it has been very strong,”  Akber Khan , a
director at Al Rayan Investment in Doha, said in a telephone
interview. “U.S. dollar yields are so low that GCC issues in
dollars look attractive for yield-hungry investors.”  Qatar Islamic, the Persian Gulf state’s biggest Shariah-
compliant lender, said last week it would start meeting with
investors in the Middle East, Asia and Europe starting Sept. 24
and had hired Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and
Qatari investment bank QInvest to manage the issuance.  The offering is to position “Qatar Islamic Bank into the
sukuk market,” Chief Executive Officer  Salah Mohammed Jaidah 
said in an interview in May.  Islamic bonds, called sukuks, comply with the religion’s
ban on interest. Sukuk sales are increasing in the Persian Gulf
after Dubai World reached an agreement with 99 percent of its
creditors this month to change terms on $24.9 billion of debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
