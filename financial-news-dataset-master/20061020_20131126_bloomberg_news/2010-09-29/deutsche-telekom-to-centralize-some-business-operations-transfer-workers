Deutsche Telekom AG is to transfer
a total of 4,700 workers in its business customer and IT
infrastucture units to new locations as the company centralizes
their operations, spokesman Husam Azrak said in a telephone
interview.  The transfers will take place within the next two and a
half years as Deutsche Telekom reduces the number of business
customer locations to nine from 141 and the number of IT
infrastructure locations to five from 96, Azrak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
