     Sept. 29 (Bloomberg) --China’s coal use will probably grow
by more than a third in the next five years, said Peabody Energy
Corp., the largest U.S. coal producer.  China’s current coal consumption of 3.3 billion tons a year
will likely rise to 4.5 billion tons, Frederick Palmer, St.
Louis-based Peabody’s senior vice president of government
relations, said at an American Conference Institute forum on
carbon-capture technology in Washington today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
