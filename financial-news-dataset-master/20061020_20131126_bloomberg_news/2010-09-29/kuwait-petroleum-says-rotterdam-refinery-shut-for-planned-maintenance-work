Kuwait Petroleum Corp. has shut its
Europoort refinery in  Rotterdam  for maintenance, potentially
limiting supplies of oil products at a time of declining
stockpiles.  “I can confirm that planned maintenance activities are
under way,” Ian McConnell, the refinery’s manager, said today
in an e-mailed statement, declining to say when the work began
and how long it was scheduled to last.  Industrial Info Resources Inc.  reported  on Sept. 21 that
the planned repairs, which began on Sept. 15, were scheduled to
finish at the end of October.  The refinery can process about 80,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stockpiles of gasoil, a category of fuel that includes
heating oil and diesel, in independent storage in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp declined 2.5 percent to 2.47 million metric
tons in the week to Sept. 23, according to PJK International BV,
a consultant based in the Netherlands. That’s the lowest level
since July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
