The  Israel Museum  in Jerusalem
restituted a drawing by  Paul Klee  to the heir of a Jewish
telephone maker who fled the Nazis in 1937.  The 1920 drawing, “Veil Dance,” was among works that
Harry Fuld left with a transportation company when he escaped
Germany for England. His art collection was seized by the Nazis
in 1941. The Klee drawing was among works handed over by the
allies to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization in 1948.  Fuld inherited the art collection and the telephone-making
company in 1932. After losing the business under Nazi
“Aryanization” laws, he emigrated to Britain. When he died in
1963, he left his estate to his housekeeper, Gisela Martin. She,
in turn, bequeathed her estate to the U.K. branch of  Magen David
Adom , Israel’s emergency medical service, in 1992.  “It is gratifying that, in restituting this work, it is
donated to an organization that supports a major charitable
cause in Israel,”  James S. Snyder , the director of the museum,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  In November last year, Berlin’s museum authorities reached
a settlement with Magen David Adom for a medieval alabaster
relief that was also part of Fuld’s collection. The charity also
recovered a painting by  Henri Matisse  from the Pompidou Center
in Paris, and is seeking to recover objects as diverse as 12th-
century Buddha statues and 16th-century Italian masters.  To contact the writer on the story:
