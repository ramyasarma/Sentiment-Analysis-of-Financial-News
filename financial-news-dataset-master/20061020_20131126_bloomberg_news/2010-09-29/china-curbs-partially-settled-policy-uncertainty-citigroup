China’s announcement of further
tightening measures on the nation’s real estate market has
“partially settled” policy uncertainties, Citigroup Inc. said.  The impact from the additional measures “may not be that
significant” and a meaningful decline in sales is unlikely,
according to a report by Oscar Choi and Marco Sze. Property
stocks have already factored in most of the bad news and
investors should add to their positions in bigger developers
including China Vanke Co. and Agile Property Holdings Ltd.,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
