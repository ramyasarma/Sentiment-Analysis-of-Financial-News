Canada’s dollar weakened for a
third day versus its U.S. counterpart, the longest losing
stretch in five weeks, before a report tomorrow forecast to show
the Canadian economy shrank for the first time in almost a year.  The currency, nicknamed the loonie for the bird’s image on
the C$1 coin, reversed an earlier advance after crude oil
briefly dropped. Investors speculated that a stalling economic
recovery in the U.S., Canada’s largest trading partner, may
prompt the Federal Reserve to resume buys of government debt.
The loonie still was poised for gains for the month and quarter.  “We’ve got strong economic ties with the U.S. and if the
U.S. sees enough reason to add additional quantitative easing,
that suggests a fairly weak economy and that would spill over to
Canada,” said  Shane Enright , a currency analyst at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto.  The Canadian dollar weakened 0.3 percent to C$1.0324 per
U.S. dollar at 4:37 p.m. in New York, from C$1.0297 yesterday.
It earlier rose 0.5 percent and dropped as much as 0.4 percent.
One Canadian dollar buys 96.86 U.S. cents. The loonie headed for
a 3.2 percent increase for September and a 3.1 percent advance
for the quarter.  Government bonds  rose, pushing 10-year yields
to the lowest level in 18 months.  The loonie is “still in a range,”  Shaun Osborne , chief
currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities
unit, said via e-mail. There’s “not much incentive to move out
of C$1.02 to C$1.0350 for the moment.”  Parity With Aussie  The Australian dollar reached parity with its Canadian
counterpart for the first time since May 7, 2004. The currency,
called the Aussie, strengthened as much as 0.6 percent to
C$1.0020 before trading at C$1.0006, up 0.4 percent. Data showed
manufacturing in China, Australia’s largest trading partner,
accelerated in September for a second month.  Canada’s economy shrank by 0.1 percent in July, the first
decrease in 11 months, according to the median of 22 forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg News. The government is due to release the
report tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. in Ottawa.  The loonie has fallen 0.2 percent over the past five days,
the worst performance of all 16 of its most-traded counterparts
except the New Zealand dollar, amid speculation the Bank of
Canada may keep the key interest rate on hold at its next
meeting. It has dropped against the euro for four straight days,
the longest since the four days ended Aug. 26.  The Canadian central bank, which meets next in October,
 raised the rate  three times since June, bringing it to 1 percent
from a record low 0.25 percent.  ‘Limits’ on Divergence  The Fed, which has kept its benchmark at a zero to 0.25
percent range since December 2008, said on Sept. 21 it’s willing
to increase efforts to boost the U.S. economy. Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  said Sept. 24 there “are limits” to how far
monetary policy in the two countries can diverge.  The yield on the Canadian government’s benchmark 10-year
note touched 2.72 percent, the lowest level since March 2009,
before trading at 2.73 percent, down 1 basis point. The  5-year
note yield  fell as much as 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 2 percent before trading at 2.01 percent.  Carney speaks tomorrow in Windsor, Ontario, about
employment and the recovery. Traders will be monitoring the
speech for clues about the direction of interest rates. His
remarks, available on the bank’s website at 12:35 p.m. New York
time with a press conference scheduled for 1:50 p.m., will
follow Statistics Canada’s release of GDP data.  “GDP is expected to be weak, and Carney may reference
again the ‘limits’ to Bank of Canada policy independence,” TD
Securities’ Osborne said. “All that could drive a little more
Canadian-dollar softness.”  Stocks fell, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index declining
0.3 percent. Crude oil for November delivery rose 2.2 percent to
$77.86 a barrel in New York after dropping 0.8 percent earlier.
