Neil Young  ramps up the feedback as
he snarls out a solo album.  Eric Clapton  sits on his porch for a
blues session with a few buddies.  Robert Plant  dismisses  Led Zeppelin  nostalgia and celebrates other joys of youth.  After decades of music-making, all three have different
responses to the challenge of being a 60-something rock star.
Yet the consensus tends to be that, in the words of Young back
in 1979, “it’s better to burn out than to fade away.”  “Le Noise” is a misleading Franglais title from Young,
64. The record is loud in places, though it’s not white noise
such as Young’s discordant “Arc” from 1991, which consisted of
guitar feedback, drums and vocal fragments.  Instead, Young is attempting a pun on Canadian producer
 Daniel Lanois , the man known for his “sonic soundscapes” for
U2. Lanois takes Young and his guitars and spends the album’s
38-minute duration massaging them with electronic effects,
echoes, distortion, sampling and looping.  Amid the gloop there are some great tracks, especially
“Hitchhiker.” This autobiographic travelogue runs through
hash, amphetamines, Valium and cocaine before Young -- who
suffered a brain aneurysm in 2005 -- concludes: “I’ve tried to
leave my past behind, but it’s catching up with me/I don’t know
how I’m standing here, living my life/I’m thankful for my
children and my faithful wife.”  Rating: ***.  “Clapton” is the first solo studio album in five years
from the 65-year-old. “God” is taking it easy with a record so
laidback it’s almost comatose. One of the tracks is called
“Rocking Chair.”  Still, as Clapton showed at his recent concerts with  Jeff Beck , he doesn’t have to try hard (or even be too much awake) to
create solos that overwhelm lesser talents.  Clapton has an impressive address book, of course, and J.J.
Cale,  Wynton Marsalis , Allen Toussaint and  Sheryl Crow  all lend
support. Rating: ***.  “Band of Joy” is an apt title for Robert Plant, 62, who
has named the album after one of his first bands in Birmingham
from the hippie years. He gleefully pulls together numbers from
indie rockers  Low  and folkie  Richard Thompson  alongside
traditional gospel songs such as “Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come
Down.”  Plant is having such fun that another reunion with  Alison Krauss  may be off the agenda -- and the prospect of a Led
Zeppelin reunion looks even more unlikely. Rating: ****.  Young and Clapton are on Warner/ Reprise Records; Plant is
on Decca/Rounder/Universal. The CDs are priced from $12.98, or
8.99 pounds in the U.K. Download fees vary across services.  Information:  http://www.neilyoung.com/ ,
