The Jacksonville Jaguars acquired
quarterback Trent Edwards off waivers after he was cut by the
Buffalo Bills.  Edwards, 26, started 32 games for Buffalo since being
selected in the 2007 National Football League draft. He was let
go two days ago.  The Jaguars, with a record of 1-2, released linebacker
Alvin Bowen to make room on the roster for Edwards, the team
said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
