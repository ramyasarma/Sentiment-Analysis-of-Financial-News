Hog futures fell the most since
early August as plunging pork prices signaled slowing demand and
ample supplies of animals available for slaughter. Cattle also
declined.  Wholesale-pork prices  fell 3.1 percent yesterday, the
biggest slide since January, and hogs sold to slaughterhouses in
the Iowa-southern Minnesota region weighed 0.5 percent more last
week than a year earlier, government data show. Supplies tend to
rise from August to December, based on animal breeding cycles
and as cooler weather increases hog weights.  “Hog numbers are increasing now, which is normal for this
time of year,” said  Dennis Smith , a senior account executive at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “Weights are also
increasing. Apparently demand has peaked for right now.”  Hog futures for December settlement dropped 2.05 cents, or
2.7 percent, to settle at 73.85 cents a pound at 1:04 p.m. on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the biggest decline for a most-
active contract since Aug. 5. Prices earlier slipped to 73.5
cents, the lowest level since Aug. 11. Hogs still are up 13
percent this year.  Wholesale pork  fell 2.78 cents yesterday to 87.9 cents a
pound, the lowest level since Aug. 10 and the biggest decline
since Jan. 26, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Archer
Financial’s Smith said the price probably will fall again today.  Meatpackers  processed  2.21 million hogs last week, up 1.9
percent from the previous week, according to the USDA. In Iowa
and southern Minnesota, the biggest producing area, the animals
weighed 269.8 pounds (122 kilograms) on average in the week
ended Sept. 25, compared with 268.5 pounds a year earlier,
department data show.  Cattle Decline  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.725 cent, or
0.7 percent, to settle at 98.575 cents a pound on the CME, the
biggest drop since Sept. 22. The commodity has climbed 14
percent this year. Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement
dropped 0.8 cent, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $1.098 a pound.  Wholesale choice beef  fell 0.2 percent to $1.5737 a pound
at midday, the lowest level since Sept. 20, USDA data show.  “The boxed beef has basically gone sideways to lower,”
said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West
Des Moines, Iowa. “We’re just treading water on the demand, as
the economy continues to be questionable.”  Some traders are selling contracts to reduce holdings
before the end of the month and the quarter, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
