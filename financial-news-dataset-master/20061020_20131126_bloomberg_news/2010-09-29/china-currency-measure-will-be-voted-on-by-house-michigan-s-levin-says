The U.S. House will vote today on
legislation to press China to increase the value of its
currency, said Representative Sander Levin, chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee.  Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said the vote on the bill,
which would let companies bring trade complaints against
importers of products that benefit from a weak yuan, is
scheduled for about 2 p.m. Washington time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
