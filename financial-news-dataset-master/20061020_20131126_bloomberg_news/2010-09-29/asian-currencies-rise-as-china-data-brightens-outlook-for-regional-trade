Asian currencies rose, led by the
Philippine peso and Taiwan’s dollar, as data that showed China’s
manufacturing quickened in September brightened the outlook for
regional trade.  The Philippine peso jumped 0.5 percent to 43.882 per dollar
as of 4:05 p.m. local time, according to prices from inter-
dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc. Taiwan’s dollar and South
Korea’s won both climbed 0.4 percent to NT$31.38 and 1,142.10
respectively.  “Compared with the U.S. and Europe, Asia’s economic growth
is definitely better, encouraging fund inflows into the
region,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at Mizuho
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Asian currencies will see pressure to
strengthen. Conditions in the U.S. and China are important for
some of the export-oriented economies in the region.”  Stock markets in India, South Korea and Taiwan have
attracted more than $10 billion in inflows this month alone,
while Indonesia and Thailand have drawn in excess of $1.6
billion, exchange data show.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen, rose to its
highest level since August 2008. The Asian Development Bank
yesterday raised its 2010 economic growth forecast for Asia’s
developing nations to 8.2 percent, from an April estimate of 7.5
percent.  China Manufacturing  Chinese manufacturing accelerated for a second month in
September, according to the findings of a purchasing managers
survey published today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. The country, the world’s second-largest economy, is
the biggest buyer of exports from Taiwan, South Korea and
Thailand.  The Taiwan dollar pared earlier gains in the last minute of
trading on signs the central bank intervened to check
appreciation that may hurt exports. The currency earlier touched
a two-year high of NT$31.211 per dollar before a central bank
policy meeting tomorrow at which 11 of 14 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predict the benchmark interest rate will be raised by
12.5 basis points to 1.5 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The won advanced for a third day as Bank of Korea official
Lee Young Bog said the surplus in the  current account , which
tracks net inflows from trade in goods and services, may exceed
the full-year prediction of $21 billion in the first nine months
of 2010. The won has gained 5 percent so far this month, Asia’s
best performance.  “At the current pace, the surplus may reach $30 billion by
the end of this year,” said  Christian Carrillo , head of Asia-
Pacific rates strategy at Societe Generale SA in Tokyo. “That
implies that the Korean won would likely continue
appreciating.”  U.S. Vote  China’s yuan traded at 6.6886 per dollar from 6.6906
yesterday and earlier touched 6.6825, the strongest level since
the central bank unified official and market exchange rates at
the end of 1993. The U.S. House of Representatives is due to
vote today on legislation that would let American companies
petition for higher duties on imports from China, which some
lawmakers say gains an unfair trade advantage by keeping the
yuan undervalued.  India’s rupee rose to its strongest level in more than four
months as overseas investors pumped record funds into local
shares this year to benefit from the nation’s relatively fast
economic growth. The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 45.05.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht rose 0.3 percent to a 13-year
high of 30.47 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Malaysia’s ringgit traded 0.1 percent higher at
3.0853 and touched 3.0813, its strongest level since 1997.
Singapore’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to S$1.3178 and
Indonesia’s rupiah advanced 0.2 percent to 8,930.  To contact the reporter on this story:
