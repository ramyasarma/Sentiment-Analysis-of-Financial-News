U.S. Senator Judd Gregg, a New
Hampshire Republican, said the China currency legislation set to
pass the House today is politically motivated and would hurt the
U.S. economy.  “I won’t vote for that,” he said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Radio. The bill aimed at prodding China to raise the
value of its currency is a “serious mistake,” Gregg said.  The House will vote later today in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
