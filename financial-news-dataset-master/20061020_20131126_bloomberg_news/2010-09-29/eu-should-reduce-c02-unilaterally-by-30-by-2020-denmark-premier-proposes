The European Union should
unilaterally raise its target for cutting carbon dioxide
emissions to 30 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels compared with
the current target of 20 percent, Danish Prime Minister Lars
Loekke Rasmussen said.  Denmark will formally propose this as the next summit of
European Union heads of state, Rasmussen said at conference in
Copenhagen.  Reaching the target should not harm competitiveness and
employment and a deal should entail “a fair burden-sharing
between E.U. member states,” Rasmussen said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
