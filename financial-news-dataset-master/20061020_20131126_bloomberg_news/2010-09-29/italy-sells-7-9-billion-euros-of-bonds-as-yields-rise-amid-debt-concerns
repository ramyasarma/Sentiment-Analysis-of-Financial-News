Italy’s borrowing costs rose at a
sale of 6.8 billion euros ($9 billion) of bonds on investor
concern that the 85-billion-euro aid package for Ireland won’t
be enough to stop the spread of the region’s debt crisis.  The Treasury sold 3 billion euros of securities due March
2021 to yield 4.43 percent, up from 3.89 percent at a sale on
Oct. 28, data from the Bank of Italy showed today. The Treasury
also sold 2.5 billion euros of securities due in November 2013
to yield 2.86 percent, more than the 2.32 percent at the
previous auction. Another 1.34 billion euros of floating-rate
notes due 2017 were sold with a yield of 2.3 percent.  Ireland yesterday became the first country to tap the
European Union’s 750 billion-euro financial backstop set up
after Greece’s near default in May as EU leaders sought to quell
the market turmoil menacing the euro. The response in the
markets to the rescue was muted, with premiums investors demand
to hold Italian and Spanish debt over German equivalents rising,
while the spreads in Portugal and Ireland narrowed.  “It’s a tough environment to come to the market, and Italy
managed to clear its bonds, but not without a sizeable
concession,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed income strategist at
Commerzbank AG in London. “I wouldn’t particularly call it a
bad auction, but the fact is there’s still a lot of reluctance
to absorb peripheral bonds given what’s going on.”  Secondary Market  The yields of the bonds sold today rose in the secondary
markets after the sale. The 2021 bond yielded 4.55 percent up 13
basis points, while the yield on the 2013 security rose 12 basis
points to 3.07. The  yield premium  on Italy’s 10-year bond over
German bunds rose 11 basis points to 179.2 basis points.  Investors bid for 1.27 times the amount of the 10-year
bonds on sale, down from 1.41 at the previous auction. The bid-
to-cover ratio on the bond maturing 2013 was 1.38 times, more
than the 1.34 times on Oct. 28.  “Demand for both lines was decent but not exceptional,
given the concession given ahead of the auction,”  Annalisa Piazza , a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in London wrote
in a note to investors.  The Treasury had set a maximum of 7 billion euros for the
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
