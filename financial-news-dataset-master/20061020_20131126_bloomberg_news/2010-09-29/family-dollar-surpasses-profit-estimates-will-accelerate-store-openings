Family Dollar Stores Inc . reported
fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates and plans to
accelerate store openings after hedge fund Trian Fund Management
LP urged faster sales growth.  Net income  totaled 56 cents a share in the quarter ended
Aug. 28, the Matthews, North Carolina-based discount retailer
said today in a statement. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey
projected on average a profit of 51 cents. The company forecast
per-share profit of $2.95 to $3.15 for this year, compared with
analysts’ estimates of $2.96.  Family Dollar, the operator of more than 6,800 stores in 44
states, plans to open 300 new outlets this year, a 50 percent
increase over openings last year. It will also renovate 600 to
800 shops,  Howard Levine , chairman and chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  Trian, headed by  Nelson Peltz ,  Peter May  and  Edward Garden ,
said July 28 that it owned 6.58 percent of Family Dollar. The
New York-based firm said in a securities filing it wanted the
retailer to boost sales growth and consider buying back more
shares.  Family Dollar said directors authorized share repurchases
of $750 million, using  cash  and potential debt financings. It
canceled previous authorizations.  The board granted permission to buy back $400 million in
shares in November 2009, spokesman Josh Braverman said today. It
had about $130 million of that remaining at the end of the
fiscal year, he said.  Fourth-quarter net income increased 23 percent to $74
million from $60.1 million a year earlier, when per-share
earnings totaled 43 cents. As reported Sept. 2, revenue rose 8
percent to $1.96 billion, boosted by a gain of 6.1 percent by
stores open for more than 13 months.  Family Dollar rose $1.13, or 2.6 percent, to $44.47 at
10:11 a.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares climbed 56
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
