Two signs from the London
headquarters of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  sold at auction
today for a total of 70,800 pounds ($111,700) as collectors and
souvenir hunters snapped up remains of the collapsed bank.  The metal sign from outside Lehman’s U.K. office, valued at
as much as 3,000 pounds, sold for 42,050 pounds at  Christie’s
International  in London. A metal plaque commemorating the
opening of the Lehman offices by the then U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer  Gordon Brown  on April 5, 2004, was estimated to sell
for between 1,000 pounds and 1,500 pounds. It fetched 28,750
pounds.  New York-based Lehman was the world’s fourth-largest
investment bank on Sept. 15, 2008, when it filed the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history. It had assets of $639 billion. More
than $830 billion in  claims  have been filed against Lehman,
which has said many are duplicates.  “Everyone recognizes the bankruptcy was the turning point
in the economy,” William Porter, head of British and Irish art
at Christie’s South Kensington, said in an interview before the
sale. “The infamy of the name is a good provenance. The
attraction lies in the car-crash element.”  Both of the signs sold today were bought by telephone
bidders. The larger sign was underbid on the Internet from
China.  Sale Total  The sale totaled 1.6 million pounds with fees against an
official forecast of 769,600 pounds to 1.1 million pounds, based
on hammer prices,  Christie’s  said. All but two of the 308
offered lots found buyers. A record 330 bidders were registered
online.  “The fall of Lehman Brothers was a historic event, a
seminal moment in the financial crisis,’’ said Nathaniel Graham,
31, a landlord from Brixton, who was an unsuccessful bidder on
several of the failed bank’s corporate signs. “I just thought
it would be nice to have something on the wall that was a
reminder of it. I’ve never bought anything at an auction before.
Unfortunately the prices were way out of my range,’’ he said in
an interview.  Graham was one of several souvenir-hunting newcomers among
the subdued audience of over 100 that gathered in Christie’s
white-painted saleroom in South Kensington. He was an under
bidder on a sign made up of green plastic-coated letters that
sold for 4,750 pounds against a high estimate of 300 pounds. The
buyer in the room was an agent, who declined to be named,
representing a banker based in Turkey. Lots estimated at 1,000
or less were offered without reserve.  Empire Falls  A leather-bound eight-volume set of  Edward Gibbon ’s
“Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire’’ was one of the more
traditional items that decorated Lehman’s Canary Wharf offices.
This sold for 2,375 pounds against a low estimate of 200 pounds
to 300 pounds, while a 1985  Lucian Freud  etching of the art
critic  Bruce Bernard  fetched 28,750 pounds against an upper
valuation of 12,000 pounds.  Bidding on the more highly estimated artworks tended to be
more measured. Gary Hume’s 1994 painting, “Madonna’’ -- the
most highly valued item in the sale at 80,000 pounds to 120,000
pounds -- sold for 73,250 pounds.  Gabriel Orozco ’s 1996 computer-generated print, “Atomists:
Jump Over,’’ featuring geometrical shapes superimposed on a
photograph of soccer players, was the most expensive lot,
selling for 99,560 pounds against an upper estimate of 80,000
pounds. Both works fell to telephone buyers, said Christie’s.  ‘Crazy Prices’  “The prices were pretty crazy,” the London-based book and
print dealer Nigel Talbot said in an interview. “We were being
asked to pay a thousand pounds for a set of Dickens.”  Lehman’s creditors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  UBS
AG , the New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority as
well as individuals who hold Lehman bonds.  The bank has said it may spend five more years selling
assets to pay unsecured creditors as little as 14.7 cents on the
dollar.  Today’s sale follows a Sept. 25 auction at Sotheby’s in New
York that raised $12.3 million for creditors. Another sale
follows at Freeman’s in Philadelphia on Nov. 7.  ( Scott Reyburn  writes about the art market for Muse, the
