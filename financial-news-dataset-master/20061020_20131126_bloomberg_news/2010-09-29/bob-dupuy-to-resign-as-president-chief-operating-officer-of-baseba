Bob DuPuy  is resigning after a
decade as president and chief operating officer of Major League
Baseball.  DuPuy, who will resign Oct. 31, will stay at the major
league offices to work on special projects, including evaluation
of the Oakland Athletics’ stadium situation. He began work with
baseball in 1989 as outside legal counsel.  “It has been a great privilege to serve the commissioner
and the 30 clubs for more than 20 years in various positions and
I greatly appreciate the confidence they have shown me
throughout,” DuPuy said in a statement.  With DuPuy’s departure, senior staff will report directly
to Commissioner  Bud Selig . No replacement for the position of
president is being considered, the league said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
