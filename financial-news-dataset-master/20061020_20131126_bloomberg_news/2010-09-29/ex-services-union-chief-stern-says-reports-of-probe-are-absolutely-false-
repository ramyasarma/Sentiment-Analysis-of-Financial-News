Andy Stern, former head of the
Service Employees International Union, said reports that he is
being investigated by the FBI and Labor Department are
“absolutely false.”  Stern said reports of an inquiry are “tabloid journalism”
spread by “unnamed sources who are former union leaders removed
from office for corruption and found guilty by a jury for
diverting money.” Stern spoke on arriving at a meeting in
Washington of President Barack Obama’s commission on the federal
deficit, on which he serves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
