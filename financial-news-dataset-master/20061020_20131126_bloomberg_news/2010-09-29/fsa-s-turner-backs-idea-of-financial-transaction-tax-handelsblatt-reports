Chairman  Adair Turner  said governments should consider
introducing a financial transaction tax, German newspaper
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview.  “We have to seriously think about a financial transaction
tax,” Turner told the newspaper ahead of a meeting of European
finance ministers in Brussels this week. A tax on speculative
trades “wouldn’t hurt and may even have some positive
effects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
