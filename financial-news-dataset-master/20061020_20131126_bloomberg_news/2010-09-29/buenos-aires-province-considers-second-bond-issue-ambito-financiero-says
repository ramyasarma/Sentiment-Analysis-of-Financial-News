Argentina’s Buenos Aires province
may sell dollar-denominated bonds for the second time this year
after issuing a $550 million five-year bond earlier this week,
Ambito Financiero  reported .  The province may sell as much as $550 million, the Buenos
Aires-based financial newspaper reported, citing Governor  Daniel Scioli . The provincial legislature authorized the governor to
issue as much as $1.1 billion worth in bonds in 2010, Ambito
said.  The bonds issued on Sept. 27 pay a 12 percent yield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
