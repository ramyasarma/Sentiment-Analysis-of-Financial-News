European stocks fluctuated, erasing
their gains.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed,

after earlier gaining as much as 0.7 percent.  Hennes & Mauritz AB sank 5.5 percent to 244.70 kronor after
Europe’s second-largest clothing retailer reported third-quarter
net income that missed analysts’ estimates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
