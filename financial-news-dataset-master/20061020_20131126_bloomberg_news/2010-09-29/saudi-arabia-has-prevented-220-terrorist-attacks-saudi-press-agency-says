Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally and
the birthplace of Islam, said it has prevented more than 220
attempted terrorist attacks since starting its battle against
al-Qaeda militants.  Saudi Arabia is able to “crush” the ideology that is
causing terrorism, the official  Saudi Press Agency  cited  Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz , the kingdom’s interior minister, as saying
late yesterday. The financing of global terrorism needs to be
prevented, the Riyadh-based news service reported the minister
as saying.  The world’s largest oil supplier cracked down on al-Qaeda
in 2004 after militants struck an oil installation and stormed a
housing complex in the city of al-Khobar, killing 22 foreign
workers. In March, Saudi forces detained 113 terrorism suspects,
including Haila al-Qusair, a woman who allegedly helped recruit
for the group in the kingdom.  The government has removed 2,000 teachers from their
positions over the last five years for teaching radical views to
students, Abdulrehman Alhadlaq, the general director for the
 interior ministry’s  Ideological Security Directorate, said in
June. Several thousand others have been arrested for collecting
money and recruiting for al-Qaeda, he said.  The U.S. and Europe must do more to stop “the bases of
terror,” Prince Nayef was cited as saying by the news service.
There had been 10 terrorist attacks in the kingdom, SPA said,
without providing more details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
