JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it is
asking judges to postpone rulings in pending foreclosure cases
while the bank reviews and possibly resubmits statements.  “It has come to our attention that in some cases employees
in our mortgage foreclosure operations may have signed
affidavits about loan documents on the basis of file reviews
done by other personnel -- without the signer personally having
reviewed those loan files,” Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for the
New York-based bank, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
