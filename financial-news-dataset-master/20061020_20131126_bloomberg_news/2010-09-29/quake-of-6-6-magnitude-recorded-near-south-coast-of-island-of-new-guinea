An earthquake with a magnitue of
Copy 6.6 was recorded near the south coast of the island of New
Guinea, the U.S. Geological Survey said on its website.  The quake was centered about 110 kilometers (68 miles)
north-northwest of Dobo in the Aru Islands of Indonesia. It
struck about 2:10 a.m. local time.  No tsunami warning was issued by the Pacific Tsunami
Warning Center in Hawaii. The Associated Press reported that a
local government agency had issued a warning for the dangerous
waves.   A massive earthquake in December 2004 off Sumatra sent a
devastating tsunami along much of the Indian Ocean coast,
including Banda Aceh in Indonesia.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
