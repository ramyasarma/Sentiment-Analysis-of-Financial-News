Tsutomu Komiya , who handles U.S.
government debt in Tokyo for Daiwa Asset Management Co., said
Treasury yields will probably decline through year-end, dropping
his earlier forecast for them to advance.  Ten-year Treasury  rates  will slide to 2.25 percent by Dec.
31, he said, from 2.47 percent as of 10:56 a.m. today in Tokyo.
Komiya, who helps oversee the equivalent of $102.7 billion,
previously forecast the level would be 3 percent.  Komiya changed his view after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and fellow policy makers said last week that they
are willing to do more to spur growth, indicating they may add
securities to the Fed’s holdings, a measure known as
quantitative easing, or QE. The central bank snapped up $300
billion of Treasuries in 2009 using this strategy. Another round
of purchases is being called QE II.  “The market is expecting QE II,” said Tokyo-based Komiya.
Betting against the Treasury market is “very risky.”  The 10-year yield will advance to 2.62 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies, with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest
weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
