An  index  of Australian leading
economic indicators rose in July as the yield spread and stocks
gained.  The New York-based Conference Board’s index climbed 0.8
percent to 120, according to a report.  The leading index uses previously reported statistics and
estimates of economic indicators, such as profits and exports,
to predict the pace of growth in coming months. The Conference
Board, a research group, also compiles indexes for the U.S.,
France, Germany, Japan and the U.K.  The index of coincident indicators, which is a gauge of the
current growth rate, rose 0.2 percent to 115.6, today’s report
showed.  To contact the reporter for this story:
