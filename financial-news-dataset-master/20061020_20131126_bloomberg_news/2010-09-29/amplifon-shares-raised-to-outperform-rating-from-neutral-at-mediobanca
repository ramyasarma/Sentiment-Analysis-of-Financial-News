Amplifon SpA , the world’s largest
hearing-aid distributor, was upgraded to “outperform” from
“neutral” at Mediobanca SpA.  The brokerage wrote in a report that the acquisition of
National Hearing Care will allow the company “to enter in new
high growth markets, increase its global market share, with
potential further developments in emerging markets like India
and China.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
