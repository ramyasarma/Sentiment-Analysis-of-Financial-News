city’s Fan Ling district for HK$459 million ($59.7 million),
beating the HK$370 million median estimate in a survey of five
analysts.  Developers pared gains after the government withdrew a site
in the city’s Chai Wan district from auction after receiving no
bids at the starting price of HK$530 million. The property was
expected to sell for HK$700 million, according to the median
estimate in a survey of five analysts.  “Even though the government managed to sell the Fan Ling
site for a better-than-consensus price, the withdrawal of the
Chai Wan site sucked some wind out of the developers’ sails,”
said  Gavin Parry , managing director of Hong Kong-based Parry
International Trading Ltd. “The government didn’t get any bids
for the Chai Wan site, so there’s concern that appetite from the
developers is diminishing.”  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 1.2 percent to 22,382.  To contact the reporter on this story:
