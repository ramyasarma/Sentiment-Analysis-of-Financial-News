Former President  Jimmy Carter  will
remain hospitalized in Cleveland for a second night as he
recovers from an upset stomach, a hospital spokeswoman said.  “His medical team continues to observe his progress,”
spokeswoman Shannon Mortland of MetroHealth Medical Center said
in an e-mailed statement. “President Carter is in very good
spirits, appreciates all the good wishes being sent his way and
looks forward to getting back to his busy schedule.”  Carter, 85, became ill on a flight to Cleveland yesterday
where he was scheduled to appear at a bookstore to discuss his
book, “White House Diary.”  Mortland said the hospital didn’t expect to issue any
further updates until tomorrow.  Carter canceled appearances scheduled today in Washington
at Politics and Prose, a bookstore, and in the evening at a
Smithsonian Associates program at George Washington University.
His book tour was planned for 12 cities from Sept. 20 to Oct.
30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
