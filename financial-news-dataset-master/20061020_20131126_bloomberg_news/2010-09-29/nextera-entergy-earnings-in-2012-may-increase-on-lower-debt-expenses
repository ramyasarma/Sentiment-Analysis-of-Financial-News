NextEra Energy Inc.  and  Entergy
Corp.  are among U.S. electric utilities that may report higher
earnings in 2012 after refinancing debt this year, Macquarie
Capital USA Inc. said.  U.S. utilities’ debt sales rose 42 percent to $11.9 billion
so far this quarter from $8.4 billion in the third quarter of
2009 as yields on investment-grade corporate debt hit the lowest
since 1986, Bloomberg data shows.  NextEra  has $21.4 billion in
debt and  Entergy  has $10.8 billion, according to the data.  Earnings in 2012 may rise 3 percent more than Macquarie’s
previous estimates for Juno Beach, Florida-based NextEra and New
Orleans-based Entergy if the companies refinance all their debt
maturing over the next two years,  Angie Storozynski  and  Cleo Zagrean , analysts with Macquarie, said in an e-mailed note
today.  “Utilities rush to issue new debt to redeem their higher-
priced bonds, reducing coupons by even 50 percent,” Storozynski
and Zagrean, based in New York, said in the note to clients.
“Despite low coupons, the offerings are often oversubscribed.”  Entergy’s utility, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana LLC, today
offered $250 million of first mortgage bonds with interest of
3.95 percent due in 2020. A unit of NextEra sold $400 million of
2.6 percent debt due Sept. 1, 2015, on Aug. 31.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds fell to 3.645
percent yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
U.S. Corporate Master Index, the lowest in data going back to
Oct. 31, 1986.  NextEra reported 2009 net income of $1.62 billion, or $3.97
a share. The company is expected to earn $4.49 a share this
year, the average of six analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. NextEra fell 34 cents to $54.67 as of the 4 p.m.
close of composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Entergy’s net income last year was $1.23 billion, or $6.30
a share. The average of seven analysts’  estimates  is $6.67 for
earnings this year. The company’s stock dropped 32 cents to
$77.24.  Earnings in 2012 at Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Duke
Energy Corp.  and Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy Inc. may also
increase, Macquarie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
