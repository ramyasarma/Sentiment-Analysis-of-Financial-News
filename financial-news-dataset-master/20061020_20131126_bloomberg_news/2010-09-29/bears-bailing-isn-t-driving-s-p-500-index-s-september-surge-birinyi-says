Bets  against U.S. stocks rose this
month as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index posted its best
September since 1939, an indication the surge wasn’t fueled by
bearish investors closing their positions, according to Birinyi
Associates Inc.  The proportion of stock sold short among all U.S. companies
represents 3.8 percent of shares available for trading, the
highest level of the year, according to data compiled by the
Westport, Connecticut-based research and investment firm.  Short sellers borrow stock to sell in the hope it will
fall, letting them repurchase it at a lower price for delivery
to the shareholder. They tend to boost share prices when they
exit their bets because they’re forced to buy stock. The 10
percent of U.S. companies that surged the most in September have
also seen the biggest rise in short interest, Birinyi said.  “This leads us to call into question the bears’ suggestion
that the September rally is due in part because of short
covering,”  Kevin Pleines , an analyst at Birinyi, wrote in a
report sent to clients yesterday.  The S&P 500 has risen 9.4 percent since Aug. 31, which make
this the best September in 71 years should the gains hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
