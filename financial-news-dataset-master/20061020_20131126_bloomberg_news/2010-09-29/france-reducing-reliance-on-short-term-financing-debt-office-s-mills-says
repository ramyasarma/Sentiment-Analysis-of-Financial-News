France has begun reducing its
reliance on short-term financing as the economy recovers from a
recession and government-borrowing needs drop, the head of the
country’s debt agency said.  Following a financial shock, governments “want short-term
debt to meet short-term needs,”  Philippe Mills , chief executive
officer of Agence France Tresor, told journalists today in
Paris. “You reduce the proportion afterwards. It is what we are
starting to do this year and will continue next year.”  The proportion of France’s public debt held in treasury
bills will fall to 16 percent by yearend from the 18.6 percent
peak at the end of 2009. That reduction amounts to a drop of
14.5 billion euros ($19.7 billion) in the issuance of
treasuries, Mills said.  President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is freezing government expenses
and ending fiscal stimulus in an effort to shrink France’s
budget deficit by the most since at least 1991. His government
said today that the shortfall will drop to 92 billion euros, or
6 percent of gross domestic product next year, from 152 billion
euros, or 7.7 percent, in 2010.  “Since the beginning of the crisis, every time the French
government has made a forecast it has always been cautious and
always resulted in good surprises later,” Mills said.  A year ago the Finance Ministry predicted deficits of 8.2
percent and 8.5 percent in 2009 and 2010. Last year’s shortfall
eventually came in at 7.5 percent.  France plans to issue 186 billion euros of medium- and
long-term bonds next year, down from 188 billion euros in 2010.
The figures are net of buybacks, Mills said. France has already
bought back 16 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2011, he said.  The country’s total financing requirement will be 189.4
billion euros next year, including the budget deficit and the
repayment of 96.8 billion euros of bonds coming due.  France, which has a top credit rating, has benefited from a
drop in borrowing costs since the financial crisis began, Mills
said. Yields on its benchmark 10-year bonds have averaged 2.56
percent this year from 2.95 percent in 2009 and 4.15 percent in
the period between the creation of the euro and 2007, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
