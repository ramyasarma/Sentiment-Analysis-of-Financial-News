Sri Lanka’s inflation outlook is
“benign” and consumer price gains won’t reach double-digits,
Governor  Ajith Nivard Cabraal  said.  “We do not see any major pressure building up,” Cabraal
said at an interview in his office in Colombo today. “We will
see slight increases and decreases but overall it will not be
uncontrollable.”  Consumer prices  in Colombo rose 5 percent in August from a
year earlier, the first acceleration in six months. The Sri
Lankan central bank lowered borrowing costs in July and August,
in contrast to monetary authorities in Asia, including India,
Malaysia and Thailand, which have raised rates to counter
inflation and prevent asset bubbles.  The Sri Lankan central bank isn’t “unduly worried” about
asset bubbles, Cabraal said.  Sri Lanka’s September inflation data will be released
tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. in Colombo. Inflation may accelerate to
5.3 percent, according to a median estimate of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
