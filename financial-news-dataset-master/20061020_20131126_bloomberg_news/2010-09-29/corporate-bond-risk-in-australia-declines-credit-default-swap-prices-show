The cost of protecting bonds in
Australia and Japan from default fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index of credit-default swaps fell
1 basis point to 101 basis points as of 8:20 a.m. in Tokyo,
according to Morgan Stanley. That’s the first drop since Sept.
22, according to CMA in New York.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 2.5 basis points
to 116.5 as of 9:51 a.m. in Sydney, according to prices from
Nomura Holdings Inc.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
