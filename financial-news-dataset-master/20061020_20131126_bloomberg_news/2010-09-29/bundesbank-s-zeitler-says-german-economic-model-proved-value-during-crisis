Bundesbank Vice President  Franz- Christoph Zeitler  said Germany’s export-based economic model
helped it emerge “astonishingly quickly” from the worst
recession since World War II.  “The oft-criticized German business model of producing
high-quality industrial and consumer goods such as cars with a
strong export focus has proven its worth yet again,” Zeitler
said in a speech in Dusseldorf today.  Zeitler said despite the stronger economy, financial
markets remain fragile and “even rumors lead to significant
nervousness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
