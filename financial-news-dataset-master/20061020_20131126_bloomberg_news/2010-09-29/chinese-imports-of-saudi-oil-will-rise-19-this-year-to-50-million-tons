China’s imports of oil from Saudi
Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, will increase 19
percent in 2010 from last year, the official  Saudi Press Agency 
reported.  Chinese imports will increase to 50 million metric tons
compared with 41.95 million tons last year, the Riyadh-based
news service said today, citing Yang Honglin, China’s ambassador
to Saudi Arabia.  Early this year, China overtook the U.S. as Saudi Arabia’s
largest buyer of oil, as the world’s biggest energy consumer
added refineries and upgraded facilities to process lower-
quality crude.  The nation plans to add 31.5 million tons a year of oil
refining capacity this year, bringing the total to 515 million
tons a year, or 10.3 million barrels per day, according to China
National Petroleum Corp., the country’s largest energy company.  Crude imports from Saudi Arabia totaled 28.3 million tons
in the first eight months of the year, making it the largest
supplier, according to data from the General Administration of
Customs in Beijing. Angola was the second biggest at 27.9
million tons.  China signed 27 new industrial projects, valued at $2.1
billion, in Saudi Arabia during the first half of this year, the
news service said. China has 81 such projects under construction
in the Arab world’s largest economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
