CVS Caremark  has been called to
provide a confidential briefing to a Senate antitrust
subcommittee relating to its 2007 acquisition of Caremark Inc.,
according to two people familiar with the situation.  CVS Caremark will appear before staff members of the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee for Antitrust,
Competition Policy and Consumer Rights on Oct. 1, one of the
people said. Both people requested anonymity because they
weren’t permitted to speak on the record.  The purpose of the meeting is to investigate complaints
from consumers concerning business practices since the CVS-
Caremark  merger , according to the people. More than 24 states
are also investigating the company, and the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission began a probe into CVS Caremark last year.  Carolyn Castel , spokeswoman for Woonsocket, Rhode Island-
based  CVS Caremark , didn’t immediately respond to e-mails and
phone calls seeking comment.  Separately, the company today received a request from U.S.
lawmakers for information on how much seniors have to pay for
prescription drugs after some consumers complained they were
being charged too much.  CVS fell 1 cent to $31.44 at 12:56 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares declined 2.4 percent this
year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
