Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
plans to visit the Kuril Islands, saying they are “a very
important part” of the country and defying Japanese calls to
avoid exacerbating a territorial dispute dating from World War
II.  Medvedev, who is returning from a three-day state visit to
China, said plans to fly to the islands this week were delayed
by bad weather. Japanese government officials have said a visit
to the region, called the Northern Territories in Japan and the
Southern Kurils in Russia, could damage relations.  “It is a very important region for our country,” Medvedev
told reporters today in Kamchatka. “Unfortunately, the weather
right now isn’t suitable for flying, but we will visit them in
the near future.”  Russia seized the islands at the end of World War II when
Japan was defeated. The dispute over their ownership has
prevented the two countries signing a formal peace treaty.  Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku  told
reports in Tokyo today that Japan was working to head off
Medvedev’s visit.  “We have conveyed our stance to Russia on various
levels,” Sengoku said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
