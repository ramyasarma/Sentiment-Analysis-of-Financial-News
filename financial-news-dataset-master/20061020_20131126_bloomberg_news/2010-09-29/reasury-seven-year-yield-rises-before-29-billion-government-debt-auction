Treasury  seven-year note yields
advanced from the lowest level since the security was
reintroduced in February 2009 as the government prepared to
auction $29 billion of the debt.  U.S. government securities have advanced 2.94 percent since
the end of June in a third quarterly gain, according to a Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said yesterday officials have the
“will to act” as needed to support the flagging recovery.  “Sevens have gotten fairly rich in outright terms and
against the curve,” said  David Ader , head of government bond
strategy in Stamford, Connecticut, at CRT Capital Group LLC. “I
would like to think we can get a concession. The market
anticipates that there is this real risk they are going to have
to do more quantitative easing.”  The yield on the seven-year note was little changed at 1.85
percent at 9:43 a.m. in New York, according to BGCantor Market
Data. The price of the 1.875 percent security maturing in August
2017 was at 100 5/32.  The 7-year note  yield  touched 1.82 percent yesterday, the
lowest level since the government began selling the debt again
more than a year ago. The 2-year note yield was little changed
at 0.44 percent, compared with the  record low  of 0.41 percent
reached on Sept. 22. The 10-year note yield was at 2.46 percent.  Treasuries rose yesterday as a $35 billion sale of five-
year notes drew the lowest yield since the government began
quarterly offerings of the securities in 1976 and a report from
the New York-based Conference Board showed consumer confidence
fell this month to the lowest level since February.  Fed Stance  The Fed announced following its Sept. 21 meeting that it’s
prepared to do more to help the economy, fueling speculation
policy makers will add securities to the central bank’s holdings
by increasing their Treasury purchases under a policy known as
quantitative easing.  “In the coming weeks, monetary policy makers must come to
grips with the question of whether there is anything they can do
to improve the situation in the economy and, if so, what that
action should be,” Lockhart said in the text of a speech
yesterday in Sewanee, Tennessee.  The central bank retained last week its stance from its
Aug. 10 meeting of keeping its portfolio of securities stable at
about $2 trillion to keep money from draining out of the
financial system. The Fed bought $550 million of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities yesterday, increasing the total
amount of U.S. debt purchased since Aug. 17 to $34.612 billion.  Seven-Year Sale  The seven-year notes being sold today yielded 1.875 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with yield of 1.989 percent at
the previous auction of the securities on Aug. 26.  “The seven-year note offers the biggest challenge of this
week’s auctions, as it looks quite expensive on the yield
curve,” said  Orlando Green , a strategist at Credit Agricole SA
in London.  Investors  bid  for 2.98 times the amount on offer last
month, compared with an average of 2.84 for the past 10 sales.
Indirect bidders, the category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 56.7 percent of the notes, versus
the 10-sale average of 50.1 percent.  Yesterday’s sale of five-year notes produced a yield of
1.260 percent, compared with the 1.276 percent average forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of eight of the 18 primary dealers
obligated to participate in U.S. debt sales.  Treasuries have returned 9 percent this year, compared with
a 2.9 percent gain in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index . U.S. debt
lost 3.7 percent in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
