Italy’s government maintained its
budget-deficit forecast, while predicting stronger economic
growth this year and higher debt.  Gross domestic product  will rise 1.2 percent in 2010, up
from the 1 percent  predicted  on May 6, according to a document
passed by the Cabinet in Rome today and posted on the Finance
Ministry’s  website . Italy’s economy will grow 1.3 percent next
year, down from a previous estimate of 1.5 percent, according to
the document.  The government raised its  debt forecast  to 118.5 percent of
GDP this year and 119.2 percent next year, from a previous
prediction of 118.4 percent and 118.7 percent, respectively. It
also maintained its deficit target of 5 percent of GDP this year
and 3.9 percent next. It released a new forecast for a deficit
of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2013.  The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold Italian 10-
year bonds rather than  German bunds , Europe’s benchmark, widened
amid concern contagion from  Greece ’s fiscal crisis and new
tensions over Portuguese and Irish bonds may infect other euro-
area nations. The  premium  over German bonds reached 169.7 basis
points as of 8 p.m. in Rome, the highest since Aug. 31,
according to Bloomberg data.  Surging  borrowing costs  triggered by Greece’s near-default
and the spread of the sovereign-debt crisis prompted Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s government to pass cuts in April
worth 24.9 billion euros ($34 billion) that aim to bring the
deficit below the European Union limit of 3 percent of GDP by
2012. Italy’s parliament approved the budget adjustment in July.  The euro region’s third-largest  economy  emerged in the
third quarter of 2009 from its worst recession since World War
II. It grew 0.5 percent in the three months through June as
exports more than offset flat  consumer spending .  Weak domestic demand may weigh on the recovery in coming
months, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development forecast in a Sept. 9 report. It predicts Italy will
be the only one of the Group of Seven industrial countries to
contract in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
