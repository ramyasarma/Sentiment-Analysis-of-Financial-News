Japan Tobacco Inc. , the world’s
third-largest publicly traded cigarette maker, said demand is
recovering in Russia, Ukraine and neighboring countries, as the
region emerges from the global recession.  Sales by volume of Japan Tobacco’s Winston, LD and other
brands in the region rose 0.6 percent in the two months ended
Aug. 31 after falling 9.7 percent in the first quarter and 7.3
percent in the second, the company said in a presentation to
investors yesterday.  Japan Tobacco  counts on Russia and other markets in eastern
Europe to spur  earnings  as it expects domestic sales to fall 16
percent this fiscal year because of a planned tax increase on
Oct. 1. The region accounts for almost half of  Japan Tobacco ’s
overseas cigarette sales by volume, according to the company.  There have been “initial signs of recovery observed, with
the return of the historic trend of higher consumption during
the summer,” the Tokyo-based company said in its presentation
in St. Petersburg.  Russia’s economy may expand 4.3 percent in 2010, compared
with a record 7.9 percent contraction in 2009, VTB Capital, a
Moscow-based investment bank, said Sept. 13.  Japan Tobacco  rose 0.1 percent to 280,700 yen at the 3 p.m.
close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock has
fallen 10 percent this year, compared with a 9.4 percent decline
in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  The cigarette maker  bought  RJR Nabisco Inc.’s international
businesses, including the Camel and Winston  brands , in 1999 and
the U.K.’s Gallaher Group in 2007.  The company’s  profit  in the first quarter declined 47
percent after domestic sales fell 7.9 percent and a stronger yen
eroded the value of overseas earnings. The Japanese government
plans to raise taxes by 70 yen (84 cents) per pack of 20
cigarettes from next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
