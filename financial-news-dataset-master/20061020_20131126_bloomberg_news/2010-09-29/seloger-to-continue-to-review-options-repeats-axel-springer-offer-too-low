SeLoger.com SA said it will
continue to review strategic options that would benefit
shareholders and repeated that the bid of 34 euros a share from
Axel Springer AG undervalues the company.  The board will continue to “review all strategic options
available and all actions which could be implemented in the
interests of the Group, and it particular its shareholders,
employees and customers,” according to a statement on PRN.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
