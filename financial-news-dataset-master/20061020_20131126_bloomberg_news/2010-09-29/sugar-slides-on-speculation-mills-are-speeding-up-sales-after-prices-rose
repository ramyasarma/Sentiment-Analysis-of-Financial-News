Sugar futures fell for the first
time in six sessions on signs that global supplies will
increase. Cocoa prices gained, and coffee fell.  India, the world’s second-biggest sugar producer, may have
a surplus of as much as 7.5 million metric tons in the year
starting Oct. 1, up from 5 million this year, the  National
Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.  said. The country
will decide on easing export curbs after early November, Farm
Minister Sharad Pawar said.  “Exports from India are a cause of concern,” said  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge USA, a broker in
New York.  “Also, there’s some profit-taking.”  Raw sugar for March delivery declined 0.36 cent, or 1.4
percent, to settle at 24.93 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price has surged 26 percent this
month after adverse weather damaged crops in Russia and
Pakistan. Brazil is the biggest producer.  On NYSE Liffe in London, refined-sugar futures for December
delivery dropped $10, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $635 a ton.  Cocoa futures advanced on concern that adverse weather will
cut the crop in Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest grower.  “There’s a lot of rain in West Africa,” said  Kona Haque ,
a London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “That’s still
mostly benign, but too much leads to black pod disease, and it
really affects quality.”  The main harvest starts on Oct. 1. Black pod is a fungus
that causes cocoa pods to rot.  Five-Week High  Cocoa futures for December delivery gained $48, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $2,865 a ton in New York. Earlier, the
price reached $2,880, the highest level for a most-active
contract since Aug. 20. The commodity has dropped 13 percent
this year.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery climbed 31
pounds, or 1.6 percent, to settle at 1,924 pounds ($3,037) a
ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 3.2
cents, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $1.8575 a pound in New York.
The price has gained 37 percent this year.  Robusta-coffee futures for November delivery declined $29,
or 1.6 percent, to close at $1,737 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
