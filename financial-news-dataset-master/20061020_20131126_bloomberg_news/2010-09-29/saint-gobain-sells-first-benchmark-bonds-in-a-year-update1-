Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA , Europe’s
biggest supplier of building materials, is raising 750 million
euros ($1 billion) from eight-year bonds in its first benchmark
issue in more than a year as it seeks to refinance debt.  Saint-Gobain plans to use longer-dated bonds to replace
debt with shorter maturities, Paris-based spokeswoman  Sophie Chevallon  said Sept. 22. She didn’t respond to two messages
today. The company, rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s, raised 750
million euros from four-year securities in May 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The notes may yield about 168 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, according to a banker involved in the sale,
who declined to be named before terms are set. That compares
with an average 143 basis points for BBB rated debt in Europe
due in five years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  “Buyers are attracted to BBB rated corporates at the
moment, achieving a yield pick-up and investment-grade risk, a
winning combination,” said  Charles Stephens , a debt capital
markets specialist at Matrix Corporate Capital LLP in London.
“Saint-Gobain is an established name with strong domestic
French support.”  Saint-Gobain is selling the debt as corporate bond issuance
jumped to 60 billion euros this month, the most since companies
raised 87 billion euros in March, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
