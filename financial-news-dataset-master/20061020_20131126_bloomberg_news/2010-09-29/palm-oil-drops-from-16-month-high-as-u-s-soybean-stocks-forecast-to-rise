Palm oil dropped from the highest
close in more than 16 months on concern supplies are improving
and as U.S. soybean stockpiles are forecast to increase from a
year earlier. Soybeans declined.  December-delivery futures lost as much as 1.1 percent to
2,706 ringgit ($877) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and were at 2,708 ringgit at 12:04 p.m. local time in
Kuala Lumpur. Yesterday, futures finished at the highest level
since May 13, 2009.  Palm oil may trade between 2,700 ringgit and 2,800 ringgit
next week and “will peg close to soybeans,” Arhnue Tan, a
senior analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn., said. Prices could
fall as low as 2,500 ringgit by the end of the year, she said.  Soybeans traded in Chicago fell a second day, losing as
much as 0.9 percent to $11 a bushel and traded at $11.03 at
12:09 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday’s drop was the biggest
since Aug. 19. Soybean and palm oils are substitutes.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture is scheduled to update
its estimates for soybeans and wheat inventories tomorrow, with
reserves of the oilseed forecast to reach 151 million bushels as
of Sept. 1, from 138 million a year earlier, according to a
survey of 19 analysts by Bloomberg News.  Palm oil has climbed for four straight weeks as demand
increased before festivals and as excess rain hurt harvests,
causing stockpiles to drop in the seven months through July.
Malaysian palm oil  reserves  climbed in August, jumping 23
percent to 1.72 million tons from July, as output rose a fourth
month, the country’s palm oil board said Sept. 15.  CME Group Inc.’s December palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, lost 0.7 percent to $880.25 a ton. On
the Dalian Commodity Exchange, May-delivery palm oil slumped 1.8
percent to 7,686 yuan ($1,149) a ton at 11:30 a.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
