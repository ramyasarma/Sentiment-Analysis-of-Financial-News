Copper prices in London rose to the
highest level in almost 26 months as metal inventories dwindled
and a report showed manufacturing increased in China, the
world’s largest user.  Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange fell to
the lowest level since Nov. 4 and are down 25 percent this year.
A China purchasing managers’ index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics reached a five-month high in
August. Copper prices have gained 35 percent in the past year.  “Copper is benefitting from the pick-up in Chinese
production and continued drawdown in stocks,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in
Chicago.  Copper for delivery in three months rose $113, or 1.4
percent, to close at $8,064 a metric ton ($3.66 a pound) at 6:15
p.m. in London. Earlier, the price reached $8,075, the highest
level since Aug. 1, 2008.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for December
delivery rose 2.45 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.6615 a pound.
Earlier, the metal reached $3.6735, the highest price for a
most-active contract since April 12.  Inventories fell 175 tons today to 375,100 tons. Stockpiles
have slumped for 31 straight weeks and are poised for the first
annual decline since 2004.  Another gauge of Chinese manufacturing was forecast to
increase by economists.  “Just as Western authorities are going for more
quantitative easing and competitive devaluation, we might just
be surprised by the strength of global growth for the next
quarter or so,” said  Nic Brown , an analyst at Natixis Commodity
Markets Ltd. in London.  Aluminum, lead, tin, nickel and zinc also rose in London.  To contact the reporters on the story:
