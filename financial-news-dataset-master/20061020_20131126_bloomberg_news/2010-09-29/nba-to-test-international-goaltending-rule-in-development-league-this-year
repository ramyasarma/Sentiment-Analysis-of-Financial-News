The National Basketball
Association’s Development League will use international
goaltending rules next season as a possible precursor to their
inclusion at the top level.  International rules permit a player to knock the basketball
away when it is within an imaginary cylinder extending up from
the rim or on the rim itself. Current NBA regulations prohibit
players from touching the ball while it is in that cylinder.  The so-called D-League is a testing ground for rules that
could be implemented in the NBA, the league said in a news
release.  “There are myriad benefits to having the NBA D-League
serve as the NBA’s farm system,”  Stu Jackson , the NBA’s vice
president of basketball operations, said in a statement. “One
of the advantages is that it allows us to look at the rules of
play and experiment with ways we can make the game more
competitive.”  The 16-team D-League also will shorten overtime periods to
three minutes from five.  To contact the reporter on this story:
