Inpex Corp. is exiting the Azadegan
oil field development project in Iran because of U.S. pressure,
Nikkei English News reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The U.S. government told Japan Inpex may be part of a list
of companies not working with unilateral U.S. sanctions against
Iran’s nuclear development program, Nikkei said, citing
unidentified sources.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
