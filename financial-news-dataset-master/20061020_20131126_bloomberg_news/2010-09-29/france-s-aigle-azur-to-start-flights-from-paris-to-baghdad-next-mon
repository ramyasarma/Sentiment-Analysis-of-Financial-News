French private carrier Aigle Azur is
due to start flights to Baghdad next month, France’s ambassador
to Iraq Boris Boillion said.  “Aigle Azur will start flights between Paris and Baghdad
in October,” he said in a telephone interview from Baghdad.  Aigle Azur, the oldest private airline in France, flies
about 1.6 million passengers to about 30 destinations mostly
around the Mediterranean and in Africa, its website said.  The airline, the third in France, has a fleet of 11 Airbus
A319, A320 and A321 aircraft.  Iraq, which decided in May to dissolve the national carrier
Iraqi Airways because of a legal battle with Kuwait Airways, is
trying to attract international carriers in a bid to restore
links with the outside world.  The country, holder of the world’s fourth largest oil
reserves, is also eager to spur business activity as violence
declines to the lowest levels since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion
that ousted the regime of Saddam Hussein.  -Editor: Chris Peterson  To contact the reporter on this story:
