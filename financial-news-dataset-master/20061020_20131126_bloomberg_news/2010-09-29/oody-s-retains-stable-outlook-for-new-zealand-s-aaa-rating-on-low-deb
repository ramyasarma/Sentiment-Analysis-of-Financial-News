Moody’s Investors Service kept its
stable outlook on New Zealand’s Aaa credit rating, the highest
grade, saying the government has a low debt position and is
likely to maintain fiscal and monetary discipline.  In May, the government forecast debt would increase until
2015 then fall. The levels projected and subsequent decline
“are still within a range easily compatible with New Zealand’s
rating,” Moody’s said today in a report.  New Zealand’s biggest vulnerability is a reliance on
foreign capital, Moody’s said. The net international investment
position is one of the largest of any advanced nation,
equivalent to about 100 percent of gross domestic product,
according to the report.  A magnitude 7 temblor that struck the Canterbury region on
Sept. 4, destroying buildings and infrastructure, is an example
of the nation’s vulnerability to earthquakes, the ratings
company said. Still, the nation’s state-owned disaster insurer
is able to meet its obligations and the government’s actual
outlays are limited, it said.  The direct budgetary impact of the earthquake is unlikely
to be sufficient to cause rating concerns, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
