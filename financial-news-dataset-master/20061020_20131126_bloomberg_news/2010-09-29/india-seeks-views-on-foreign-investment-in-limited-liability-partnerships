India’s trade ministry invited
feedback on allowing overseas investment in limited liability
partnerships, such as those used by lawyers and accountants, in
Asia’s third-biggest economy.  Allowing foreign direct investment in partnerships may
encourage small entrepreneurs and businesses to seek financial
backing and collaboration from overseas partners, said a
 discussion paper  prepared by the Department of Industrial Policy
and Promotion and posted on its website.  India, which caps the level of foreign investment in
industries such as insurance and telecommunications, will find
it difficult to impose similar limits on limited liability
partnerships because of their more flexible management and
ownership structures, the paper said.  The observations of the department shouldn’t be construed
as the views of the government, the discussion paper said.
