Dubai’s government may raise $1.25
billion in a two-part bond sale in its first sovereign issue
since the Dubai World credit crisis, according to four bankers
familiar with the transaction.  The Persian Gulf financial hub’s 5-year, $500-million issue
may be priced to yield about 6.7 percent, according to the
bankers. The $750-million 10-year note may be priced to yield
7.75 percent, they said, declining to be identified because the
information hasn’t been made public.  Dubai hired Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and
Standard Chartered Plc as joint lead managers for a dollar bond
offering, the government said. The sheikhdom expects the notes
to be sold subject to market conditions, with the money used for
the general budget, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
