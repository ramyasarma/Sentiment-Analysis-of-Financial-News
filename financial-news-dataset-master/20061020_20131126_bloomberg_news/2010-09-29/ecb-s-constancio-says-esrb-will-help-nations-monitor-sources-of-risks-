European Central Bank Vice
President  Vitor Constancio  said the European Systemic Risk Board
will help authorities monitor “various sources of risks” to
financial stability and help shield the system from shocks.  “The challenges of designing and implementing this new
European Union-wide macro-prudential policy function are
considerable,” Constancio said at a conference in Brussels
today. “However, with appropriate preparations, which are
already ongoing in close cooperation with all the parties
involved, a smooth start of the ESRB may be envisaged” in 2011.  EU lawmakers last week approved the creation of the ESRB,
chaired by ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet , to monitor markets
and send warnings to nations on economic and financial risk. The
European Commission proposed new agencies last year as part of
an overhaul of regulation following the financial crisis.  The board “has a great potential for enhancing the ability
of European and national authorities to safeguard the
stability” of the financial system, Constancio said. Central
banks should “play a major role” given “their interest in,
and responsibility for, the stability” of the system, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
