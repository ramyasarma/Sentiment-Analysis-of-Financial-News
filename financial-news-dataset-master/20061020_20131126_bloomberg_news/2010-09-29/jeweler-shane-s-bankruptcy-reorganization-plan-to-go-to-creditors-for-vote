Shane Co., the owner of a retail
jewelry chain, won court approval to send its bankruptcy
reorganization plan to creditors for a vote.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Howard Tallman , after a two-day
hearing in Denver, yesterday approved Shane’s disclosure
statement, which explains the plan, moving the company a step
closer toward exiting Chapter 11. A hearing on confirmation of
the plan is scheduled for Nov. 10.  Shane, based in Centennial, Colorado, filed for creditor
protection in January 2009, saying the recession “had a
substantial, negative impact on its revenue.” The company also
defaulted on the terms of loan agreements.  Under the plan, filed in August and amended yesterday,
Shane will pay creditors holding secured claims in full. Holders
of general unsecured claims will be paid “over time, from
available revenues of the company,” Shane said.  Revenue for the year ended in January 2009 fell 23 percent
to $212 million from $276 million the year before, the company
said.  The case is In re Shane Co., 09-10367, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Colorado (Denver).  To contact the reporter on this story:
