Poland won’t emulate a move by
Spain and subsidize coal used for electricity generation, the
Economy Ministry said.  Spain today won approval from the European Commission to
grant compensation to electricity generators that buy coal from
local mines until 2014. European Union regulations allow member
states to implement such measures, limiting support to 15
percent of national power use to ensure security of energy
supplies.  “For Poland, these measures are not interesting given that
the country produces as much as 50 percent of electricity from
coal,” the ministry said in an e-mailed response to a question
from Bloomberg News.  Poland produces 90 percent of its electricity from coal and
lignite.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Marek Strzelecki  in
