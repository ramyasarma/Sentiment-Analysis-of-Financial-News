  BP Plc ’s $3.5 billion bond sale
generated a profit of about $54 million for fixed-income
investors as the energy company returned to the  debt market  for
the first time since a rig explosion caused the largest offshore
U.S. oil spill in history.  BP’s $1.5 billion of 10-year, 4.5 percent bonds increased
2.34 cents to 101.79 cents on the dollar, as of 1:10 p.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The London-based
company’s $2 billion of five-year, 3.125 percent notes rose 0.92
cent to 100.64 cents on the dollar.  The offering, sold yesterday through its BP Capital Markets
Plc unit, provided investors with better relative terms than
other bonds in the new-issue market even as BP’s problems are
“pretty much behind them,” said  Mirko Mikelic , a money manager
at Fifth Third Asset Management. Credit-default swaps on the
company’s debt rallied before and after the sale to the lowest
since June, according to CMA.  “BP actually offered a concession,” said Mikelic, who
helps oversee $13 billion of fixed-income assets in  Grand
Rapids ,  Michigan . “You only get a concession when there’s hair
on the issue,” he said, referring to the yield premium on new
debt versus existing securities.  Credit-default swap prices on BP decreased 17.5 basis
points to 168.6 basis points, the lowest since June 1, CMA data
show. The contracts have declined 103.7 basis points this month.  BP should have “sufficient” liquid resources to meet
likely spill-related cash costs of at least $20 billion this
year and next, Standard & Poor’s said Sept. 24 in a statement.  ‘Business as Usual’  The five-year notes issued at a spread of 195 basis points,
about 5 basis points wider than the company’s outstanding 3.875
percent debt due in 2015 on Sept. 24, Trace data show. The 10-
year bonds priced at a spread of 210 basis points, about 27
basis points wider than its 4.75 percent securities due in 2019.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The five-year notes’ spread tightened today to 174.4 basis
points, Trace data show, while the 10-year bonds narrowed to
179.9 basis points.  “We’re very pleased with the response to the issue
yesterday,” said  Andrew Gowers , a BP spokesman. “The market
reception is an important sign that we’re returning to business
as usual.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
