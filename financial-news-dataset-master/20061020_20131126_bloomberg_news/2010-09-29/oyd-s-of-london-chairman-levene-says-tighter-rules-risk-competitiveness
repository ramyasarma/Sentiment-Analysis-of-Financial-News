Lloyd’s of London Chairman  Peter Levene  criticized regulators’ “unhealthy fascination” with
examining the consequences of the credit crisis, saying excess
scrutiny risks hindering London’s competitiveness with China.  “In the past, the city of London would look at Frankfurt
or Paris as possible competitors: now the principal pretenders
are outside of the European Union in Hong Kong or Shanghai,” he
said in remarks prepared for a speech at  Plaisterers’ Hall  in
London today. “The Chinese authorities do not spend their time
debating the finer points of how to draft living wills for their
financial institutions.”  Levene, 68, spoke after Lloyd’s, the world’s oldest
insurance market, posted a 50 percent drop in first-half profit
this week on higher claims following the Chilean earthquake and
the Deepwater Horizon oil-rig explosion. He also sought to
distance insurers from the banking industry, the subject of
unprecedented regulatory scrutiny since the credit crisis.  “Insurance is not banking,” he said. “Our risk
management, our capital management is entirely different from
the banks.”  “We find ourselves, two years on from the collapse of
Lehman, still fighting a rearguard action, trying to convince
regulators not to impose harsh conditions on us,” Levene said.
