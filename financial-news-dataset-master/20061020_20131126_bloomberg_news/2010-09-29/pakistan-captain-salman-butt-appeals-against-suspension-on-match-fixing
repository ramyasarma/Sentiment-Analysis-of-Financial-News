Pakistan cricketer Salman Butt is
appealing his provisional suspension by the sport’s ruling body
after allegations of his involvement in a betting scam.  Butt, the team captain, and fast bowlers Mohammad Asif and
Mohammad Amir, last month were questioned by police and had
their mobile phones taken after the News of the World newspaper
made allegations of a betting scam during the fourth Test
against England at Lord’s in London. A 35-year-old man was also
arrested “on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers” and
later released.   The players were charged with violations of the
International Cricket Council’s anti-corruption code and
suspended April 2. They maintained their innocence and were sent
home from the remainder of the team’s tour of England. Asif and
Amir haven’t appealed, the ICC said.  The chairman of the ICC’s conduct commission will decide
whether Butt will remain suspended until a hearing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
