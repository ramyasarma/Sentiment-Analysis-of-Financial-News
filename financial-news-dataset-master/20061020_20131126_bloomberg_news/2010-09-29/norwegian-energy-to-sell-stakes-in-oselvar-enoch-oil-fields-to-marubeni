Norwegian Energy Co. ASA  agreed to
sell its stakes in the Norwegian oil fields Oselvar and Enoch to
Marubeni Corp., a Japanese trading company.  The company is selling the fields for $43 million after
tax, with an option for an additional 200 million kroner ($34
million) after the development of Oselvar, the Stavanger-based
company said today in a statement. Norwegian Energy has a 15
percent stake in Oselvar and 4.4 percent in Enoch.  This sale “will strengthen our ability to pursue new value
creating activities,”  Scott Kerr , Norwegian Energy’s chief
executive officer, said in the statement. The company’s “main
focus is finding oil and gas, and over the last years we have
built a strong track record of exploration success.”  Oselvar, an oil and gas field, is under development and
production is expected to start in the fourth quarter next year.
It’s located in license PL274 and PL274CS in the southern North
Sea while Enoch is located in the central North Sea.  Oselvar has recoverable reserves estimated at 4.34 billion
cubic meters of gas and 3.91 million cubic meters of oil, the
Norwegian government said in June 2009. The field is being
developed by Denmark’s Dong Energy A/S.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
