Domino’s Pizza U.K. & Ireland Plc ,
the U.K.’s biggest pizza-delivery company, said it expects full-
year profit to be at the upper end of analysts’ estimates,
boosted by higher Internet sales.  Sales at outlets open at least a year gained 9.9 percent in
the 13 weeks ended Sept. 26, the Milton Keynes, England-based
company said in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News
Service today. System sales gained 18 percent to 115.7 million
pounds ($183.2 million).  Internet revenue climbed 69 percent for the period to 33
million pounds, with online sales now comprising almost 40
percent of delivered revenue, up from 29 percent a year earlier,
the company said. Domino’s opened 16 new outlets during the
quarter, in line with its goal of opening 55 during the year.  “As a result of our strong trading in the third quarter
and, indeed, the year so far, the board believes it is on track
to achieve full-year profitability at the upper end of current
market expectations,” Chief Executive Officer  Chris Moore  said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
