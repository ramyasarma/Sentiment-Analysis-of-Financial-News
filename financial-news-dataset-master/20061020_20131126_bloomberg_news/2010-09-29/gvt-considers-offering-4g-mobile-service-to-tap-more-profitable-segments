GVT Holding SA, the Brazilian
telephone operator controlled by Vivendi SA, is studying the
possibility of offering fourth-generation mobile service to tap
more profitable segments, said Chief Executive Officer Amos
Genish.  “Companies with 4G licenses will be able to offer
interesting products to customers,”  said Genish in a telephone
interview from Curitiba, Brazil on Sept. 27. “When the auctions
terms are out, we’ll analyse it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
