Italy’s government maintained its
deficit forecast, while predicting stronger economic growth this
year and a higher debt, news agencies Ansa and Radiocor
reported, citing a new budget document to be released today.  Italy’s economy will grow 1.2 percent this year, more than
the 1 percent forecast in May, Ansa said.  The government raised its  debt forecast  to 118.5 percent of
GDP this year and 119.2 percent next year, from a previous
prediction of 118.4 percent and 118.7 percent, respectively,
Radiocor said. It also confirmed its budget deficit targets of 5
percent of GDP in 2010 and 3.9 percent in 2011. It released a
new forecast for a deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
