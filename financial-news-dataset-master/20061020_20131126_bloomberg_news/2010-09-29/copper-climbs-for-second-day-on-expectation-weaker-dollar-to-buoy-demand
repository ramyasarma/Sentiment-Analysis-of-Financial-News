Copper advanced above $8,000 a
metric ton for the first time since April as a weaker dollar and
an acceleration in China’s manufacturing buoyed the outlook for
commodities. Tin rose to the highest level since May 2008.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange increased as much as 1.1 percent to $8,038 a metric ton,
the highest price since April 12, and traded at $8,028 at 3:27
p.m. Singapore time. January-delivery copper on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange rose 0.8 percent to 60,850 yuan ($9,101) a ton.  “Commodities will continue to be in the hands of the
dollar and economic data,” Xi Bingrong, an analyst at Huishang
Futures Co., said from Anhui. “The expectation is for dollar
weakness in the months ahead and that will keep prices
supported.” A weaker U.S. currency reduces the cost of dollar-
denominated commodities for holders of other monies.  The  dollar  dropped for a fourth day against a six-currency
basket to the weakest level since Jan. 28. Manufacturing in
China grew for a second straight month to a five-month high in
September, a purchasing managers’ index released today by  HSBC 
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed.  Copper stockpiles in London Metal Exchange warehouses
dropped to 375,275 tons yesterday, the lowest level since
November. Shanghai inventories declined to 94,365 tons last week.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. is
forecast to report tomorrow that its business barometer fell to
55.7 this month from 56.7 in August, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. A level
greater than 50 signals expansion.  ‘Consumption Robust’  “Economic data also suggests consumption has been robust
so far this year and this will help prices to rally,” Xi said.  Copper, used in construction and automobiles, has jumped 23
percent since the end of June, is set for its best quarterly
performance since the period ending Sept. 30, 2009, as the
Dollar Index dropped 8.5 percent. The metal has recovered from
its worst quarter since 2008 as falling stockpiles improved the
demand outlook, said Xi.  Tin in London gained as much as 1 percent to $24,250 a ton,
the highest price since May 2008 and last traded at $24,100.
Aluminum rose 1 percent to $2,332.25 a ton, zinc gained 0.7
percent to $2,235.25 a ton, lead climbed 1.4 percent to $2,313 a
ton and nickel advanced 0.9 percent to $23,375 a ton by 3:31 p.m.
