Germany’s Interior Ministry said it
has no evidence that terrorist attacks on German soil are
imminent. “At present, there are no concrete indications of
imminent attacks in Germany,” ministry spokesman Stefan Paris
said in an e-mailed statement. Germany is aware of news reports
in the U.K. and the U.S. about alleged al-Qaeda plans to attack
European targets, the statement said. “The current reports
don’t lead to any change in the threat assessment.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
