Nintendo Co. , the world’s biggest
maker of video-game machines, cut its annual  profit forecast  to
the lowest level in six years, citing the outlook for year-end
sales and a stronger yen.  Net income  will total 90 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in the
year ending March 2011, compared with an earlier forecast for
200 billion yen, the Kyoto, Japan-based company said in a
statement today. The company reported a profit of 228.6 billion
yen last year.  The stronger Japanese currency and “release conditions for
the Nintendo 3DS” game player are hurting earnings, Nintendo
said. The company will introduce the new hand-held machine in
February, missing the year-end holiday season. The yen has
surged against the dollar this year, reaching a 15-year high of
82.88 earlier this month and reducing the company’s repatriated
earnings from overseas sales.  “February is an odd time to release the product. The
holiday season will be over,” said  Yoshihiro Okumura , who helps
manage the equivalent of $365 million at Chiba-Gin Asset
Management Co. in?Tokyo. “The new product won’t contribute much
to the current fiscal year’s earnings. The expectation for the
new hardware was high.”  3DS Release  Nintendo will begin sales of its three-dimensional 3DS
handheld player starting Feb. 26 in Japan and in the following
month in the U.S. and Europe, the company said today, before the
forecast announcement.  The product will be priced at 25,000 yen in Japan and is
Nintendo’s biggest portable product debut since the 2004 release
of the touch-screen DS player, which sold more than 132 million
units worldwide.  Nintendo fell 3.7 percent to close at 23,010 yen in Osaka
 trading , narrowing its gain this year to 4.4 percent. Japan’s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average has slid 9.4 percent this
year.  The DS and Nintendo’s Wii consoles led a 10 percent decline
in U.S. video-game hardware and software sales in August, market
researcher NPD Group Inc. said earlier this month. Sales of the
DS slumped 38 percent to 342,700 players, while those of the Wii
fell 12 percent to 244,300 consoles, the lowest since its debut
in November 2006, according to NPD.  The Wii, which allows players to simulate tennis shots or
golf-club and sword strokes by using a controller, is facing
increased competition as  Sony Corp.  and Microsoft Corp. release
their own motion-sensing devices.  Sales will probably total 1.1 trillion yen for the year,
compared with an earlier forecast for 1.4 trillion yen, Nintendo
said today. Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods
sold and administrative expenses, will be 210 billion yen, 34
percent less than previously forecast.  The company changed its assumptions for the yen’s  exchange 
rate to 85 yen to the dollar from 95 yen, and 110 yen to the
euro from 120 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
