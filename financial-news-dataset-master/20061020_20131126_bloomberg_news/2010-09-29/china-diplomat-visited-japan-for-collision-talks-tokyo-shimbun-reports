A Chinese diplomat visited Japan
this month for talks with government lawmakers after Japan
detained a Chinese fishing boat crew, the Tokyo Shimbun
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Liu Hongcai, previously a diplomat in Japan and currently
China’s ambassador to North Korea, visited Japan Sept. 12-15,
the report said.  The Chinese crew were arrested after their boat collided
with Japan coast guard vessels on Sept. 7 near disputed islands.
Japan released the 14 crew members on Sept. 13 and the captain
on Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
