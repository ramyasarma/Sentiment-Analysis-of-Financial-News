U.S. stocks fell, trimming the best
September rally for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since 1939,
amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and the
profit outlook for banks and retailers is deteriorating.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. declined more
than 1.1 percent, pacing losses in financial companies. Urban
Outfitters Inc. slumped 8.4 percent as Hennes & Mauritz AB,
Europe’s second-largest clothing retailer, said third-quarter
profitability missed analysts’ estimates. Benchmark indexes
 fluctuated  earlier as energy stocks rallied on higher oil prices
and Hewlett-Packard Co. advanced 2.2 percent after its earnings
forecast topped estimates.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.3 percent to 1,144.73 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 22.86 points, or
0.2 percent, to 10,835.28.  “The market’s had a nice rally and it’s waiting on the
next factor to get it through the next level,” said  Larry Peruzzi , senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets Inc. in
Boston. “As the quarter ends and before earnings coming up, the
market’s been swinging up and down.”  Alcoa Inc., the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, will become
the first Dow company to report third-quarter results on Oct. 7.
Earnings for the S&P 500 increased 24 percent during the
period, according to the average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  The S&P 500 has jumped 9.1 percent so far this  month ,
poised for its biggest September rally in 71 years, as concern
eased that Europe’s debt crisis and U.S. unemployment will
derail the economic rebound.  ‘Nice Bounce’  “The market’s been digesting what turned out to be one of
the strongest Septembers in quite a while,” said  Hank Smith ,
chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co., which manages
about $6 billion in Radnor, Pennsylvania. “We clearly had a
nice bounce here on evidence that the risks of a double dip
aren’t as high as we thought a month ago.”  U.S. banks followed European lenders lower on concern the
region’s most-indebted nations will struggle to finance budget
deficits. Spain’s top credit rating at Moody’s Investors Service
is at risk as the nation struggles to emerge from recession and
reduce its budget deficit, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Ireland will announce the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank
Corp. tomorrow.  Demonstrators in a dozen European cities marched today
against government spending cuts. Spanish workers disrupted
transportation and television broadcasts in the first general
strike in eight years. In Athens, rail, communications and port
workers staged strikes. Police in Dublin made an arrest after a
truck damaged the front gates of the parliament building.  ‘On-and-Off Concern’  “The sovereign risk in Europe has been an on-and-off
concern for the marketplace,” said  Mark Bronzo , a money manager
in Irvington, New York, at Security Global Investors, which
oversees $21 billion. “It’s more a tug-of-war of how domestic
growth here will play out versus international growth.”  JPMorgan Chase slumped 1.4 percent to $38.41 and  Wells
Fargo  dropped 1.2 percent to $25.04, leading a measure of
financial companies in the S&P 500 to a 0.8 percent decline that
was the second-biggest drop among 10 groups in the index.  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. declined after
 Meredith Whitney , founder of Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC
in New York, reduced her full-year earnings estimates on the
banks for 2010 through 2012.  Morgan Stanley slipped 0.1 percent to $24.48. Goldman Sachs
lost 0.4 percent to $144.42. Analysts at Goldman also cut Morgan
Stanley’s third-quarter  profit projections , citing “soft”
revenue from the firm’s fixed-income, currency and commodities
and equities divisions.  ‘Muted Activity’  “Investment bank earnings are likely to be soft in the
third quarter 2010,” the analysts, led by  Richard Ramsden , said
in a note to clients dated yesterday. The largest adjustments
are due to “muted activity” in fixed income and equities, they
said.  Urban Outfitters sank 8.4 percent, the most since December
2008, to $31.96 for the biggest decline in the S&P 500.
Stockholm-based Hennes & Mauritz said third-quarter profit rose
23 percent, missing analysts’ estimates as the gross margin
narrowed. J. Crew Group Inc. fell 1.6 percent to $33.31 after
Janney Montgomery analyst  Adrienne Tennant  cut the company’s
rating to “neutral” from “buy.”  DuPont Co., the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker, declined
2.5 percent to $44.53, leading materials stocks to a 0.9 percent
decline, the biggest out of 10 groups in the S&P 500.  Monsanto Slumps  Monsanto Co. fell 1.5 percent to $48, dropping for a 10th
day in 11. Goldman Sachs said the company’s SmartStax corn, a
new seed with eight genetic changes, probably won’t yield more
than a less-expensive technology that has three added genes. Dow
Chemical Co., which developed SmartStax with Monsanto, lost 1.7
percent to $27.39.  Hewlett-Packard  climbed 2.2 percent to $42.53. Interim
Chief Executive Officer  Cathie Lesjak  said the company expects
2011 earnings excluding costs of $5.05 to $5.15 a share on sales
of $131.5 billion to $133.5 billion. Analysts had predicted
sales of $131.7 billion and earnings of $5.01 a share, according
to a Bloomberg survey. Lesjak also said the company plans to
return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.  A measure of energy stocks rallied 0.7 percent, one of 4
 groups  to gain out of 24 in the S&P 500, as crude oil rose to a
seven-week high amid declining in supplies of gasoline and
distillate fuel.  Schlumburger Ltd. advanced 2 percent to $61.52. EQT Corp.
rose 4.6 percent to $35.98. The oil and natural gas producer
said two Pennsylvania wells in the Marcellus Shale formation
produced “exceptional” results.  Boeing, Green Mountain  Boeing Co. gained 2.3 percent to $65.97, the biggest
advance in the Dow. The second-largest U.S. defense contractor
received a contract for 124 F/A-18 fighter jets valued at $5.3
billion, the Pentagon said on its Web site.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. fell 16 percent to
$31.06 for the biggest retreat in the  Russell 1000 Index . The
maker of coffee and Keurig brewing machines said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission started an inquiry that may
be related to the company’s “revenue recognition practices”
and its relationship with a vendor.  Liberty Mutual Holding Co. shelved its initial public
offering in Liberty Mutual Agency Corp., which sought to raise
$1.3 billion in what would have been the biggest American IPO of
2010. The insurer said demand was less than projected.  At least 45 companies have delayed or canceled U.S. initial
sales this year as concern that the recovery from the longest
recession since the Great Depression is deteriorating sent the
S&P 500 down as much as 16 percent from its 2010 high. The index
has rebounded 12 percent from its low for the year in July.  ‘Very Bullish’  FedEx Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Fred Smith  said China,
India and Brazil are leading a recovery in the express-shipping
industry and he’s optimistic about the company’s prospects next
year.  “As we get into the second half of fiscal 2011 and roll
into 2012, we’re very bullish,” Smith said at an investor
conference today in Memphis, Tennessee, where FedEx is based.
FedEx shares rose 2 percent to $86.37. The comments were made
after markets closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
