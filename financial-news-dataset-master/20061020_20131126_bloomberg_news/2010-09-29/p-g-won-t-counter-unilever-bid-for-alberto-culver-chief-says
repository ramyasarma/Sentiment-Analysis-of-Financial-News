     Sept. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Procter & Gamble Co. , the world’s
largest consumer-products company, will not counter a bid by
Unilever NV for Alberto-Culver Co.,  Robert McDonald , the
company’s chief executive officer, said today in an
interview.  A bid for Alberto-Culver could present “antitrust
issues,” McDonald said today in an interview in Urlati,
Romania.  Global economic growth is picking up, but is “uneven” and
“not quite fast yet to replace the employment lost during the
crisis,” he said.  Procter & Gamble is interested in acquiring Beiersdorf AG
but that company “must make the first step,” McDonald said. A
contract and price for Beiersdorf “must be right,” he said.
“It’s a terrific global brand. But the company has to come to
us.”  Procter & Gamble sees second-half earnings “better” than
in the first six months of the year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
