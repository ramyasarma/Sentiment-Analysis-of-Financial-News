Gold futures rose to a record for
the ninth time since mid-September as the slumping dollar
boosted demand for the precious metal as an alternative
investment. Silver reached the highest price since 1980.  In New York, gold reached an all-time high of $1,314.80 an
ounce, and silver climbed above $22 an ounce. The  greenback 
dropped to the lowest level since January against a basket of
major currencies on bets the Federal Reserve will ease monetary
policy further to bolster the slowing U.S. economy.  “Most of what we have witnessed in the complex during the
month has been clearly based on perceptions of an inevitable
second chapter in Fed accommodation,” said  Jon Nadler , a senior
analyst at Kitco Inc. in Montreal.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $2, or 0.2 percent,
to settle at $1,310.30 at 1:53 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed to a record $1,313.45.
The price has gained 19 percent this year. The metal headed for
the 10th consecutive annual gain, the longest winning streak
since at least 1920.  Yesterday,  holdings  in exchange-traded products backed by
gold climbed the most in three months to an all-time high.  The metal has rallied as central banks and governments
maintained low borrowing costs and spent trillions of dollars to
stimulate their economies. Gold has outperformed global
equities, Treasuries and most industrial metals.  ‘Inflationary Implications’  “Speculation of additional stimulus measures and its
inflationary implications longer term continues to draw
investors toward gold and silver,” said  James Moore , an analyst
at TheBullionDesk.com in London.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 24.5 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $21.952 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the
price reached $22.075, the highest level since October 1980. The
metal has jumped 30 percent this year.  In 1980, the metal reached a record $50.35, a year after
the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market.  Platinum futures for January delivery gained $15.90, or 1
percent, to $1,656.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price has advanced 13 percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery climbed $6.85, or
1.2 percent, to $567.30 an ounce. The metal has climbed 39
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
