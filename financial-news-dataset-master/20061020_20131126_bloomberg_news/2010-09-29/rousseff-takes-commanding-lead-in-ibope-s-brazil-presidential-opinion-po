percent of those surveyed in the Ibope poll conducted Sept. 25-

percent in the previous poll taken in June.  The nationwide poll of 3,010 people was taken Sept. 25-27
and has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.  Former Sao Paulo Governor Jose Serra, of the opposition
Social Democracy Party, had 27 percent, down from 32 percent in
June. Backing for Green  Party candidate   Marina Silva  rose to
13 percent from 7 percent.  The real gained 0.3 percent to 1.7035 per dollar at 9:17
