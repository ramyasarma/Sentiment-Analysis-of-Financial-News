U.K. Labour Party leader Ed
Miliband said his brother David’s possible decision not to be
part of the opposition team of spokesmen would not “cast a
shadow” over the future of his party as it prepares to take on
Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative Party. Miliband told
BBC 1 television his brother should make up his mind.  To contact the reporter on this story:
