Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  Chief
Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer  expects market volatility
through 2012 to have an impact on demand for cars,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  said.  This year Reithofer expects a profit margin before interest
and tax of 5 percent and sales of 1.4 million vehicles, he told
the newspaper, reiterating earlier targets.  In the future, the Munich-based company may consider
“flexible leasing” of cars to win new customers in cities who
may not want to own a vehicle, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
