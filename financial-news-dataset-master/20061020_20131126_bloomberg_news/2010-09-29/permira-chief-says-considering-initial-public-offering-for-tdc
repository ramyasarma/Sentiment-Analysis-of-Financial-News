Kurt Björklund , Permira Advisers
LLP’s co-managing partner, said his private equity firm is
considering an initial public offering of TDC A/S, Denmark’s
largest phone company, as the pace of stock offerings picks up.  “It’s one of many options we’re considering,” he said in
an interview with Bloomberg Television today. “Are IPOs going
to come back? Yes, they’re coming back. But there’s a need for
both buyers and sellers to find the right balance of pricing.”  Private equity firms, which use IPOs to sell their
companies and return cash to investors, had to delay or cancel
share sales in the first half as investor demand dried up.
London-based Permira dropped a planned IPO of retailer New Look
Group Ltd. in February citing unfavorable market conditions.  “New Look continued growing throughout the recession,”
Björklund said today. “It’s always done that, it’s a great
investment for us and we’re in no hurry to exit it.”  TDC was acquired by private-equity firms Blackstone Group
LP, KKR & Co., Apax Partners LLP and Permira in 2006 in Europe’s
biggest leveraged buyout at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
