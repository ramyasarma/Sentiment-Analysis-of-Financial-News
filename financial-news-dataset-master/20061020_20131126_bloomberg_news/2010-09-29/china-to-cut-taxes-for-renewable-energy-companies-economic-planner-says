China, the world’s biggest polluter
and energy user, will continue to implement measures including
tax incentives, price reforms and financial subsidies to spur
environmental and power conservation in the next five years.  “We will persist with all these economic measures during
the 12th five-year plan” as China faces increasing difficulty
in meeting its climate-change goals in the next decade,  Xie Zhenhua , vice chairman of the National Development and Reform
Commission, told reporters in Beijing today.  China has introduced tax breaks for renewable-energy
companies and increased prices for electricity produced from
cleaner fuels. Plans to develop alternative energy during the
2011 to 2020 period have been submitted to the State Council, or
Cabinet, for approval, according to Jiang Bing, head of the
National Energy Administration’s planning and development
department, in July.  The country will spend 83.3 billion yuan ($12.5 billion) on
energy and environmental conservation this year after investing
128.5 billion yuan in the 2006 to 2009 period, Xie said. China
may spend 5 trillion yuan in the decade through 2020 to develop
less-polluting sources of energy, the NEA’s Jiang said in July.  “China can still realize its target for energy
conservation and emissions reduction for the 11th five-year
plan,” Xie said, referring to goals to cut energy consumption
per unit gross domestic product by 20 percent in the five years
through 2010. Energy intensity rose 0.09 percent in the first
six months compared with a year earlier.  This year, the government plans to close 10,000 megawatts
of small power generators, 25 million metric tons of obsolete
iron-mill capacity, 6 million tons of steel capacity and 50
million tons of cement capacity. That will result in energy
saving equivalent to 16 million tons of coal, Xie said.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Ryan Woo .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
