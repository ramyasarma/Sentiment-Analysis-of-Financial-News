Julius Baer Group Ltd. said most of
its German client assets are tax compliant,  Handelszeitung 
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer  Boris Collardi .  “Since I arrived, our motto is that we only accept taxed
money,” Collardi told the Zurich-based newspaper.  A tax agreement being negotiated between Switzerland and
Germany is crucial to clarifying “how we can operate our
business from Switzerland,” Collardi told the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
