The U.S. Treasury Department
announced today it will sell trust preferred securities it
received from Citigroup Inc. last year.  The proceeds of the sale will represent a profit for U.S.
taxpayers, Treasury said in a statement. These securities were
received in consideration for Treasury’s agreement in January
2009 to share potential losses on a pool of $301 billion of
assets held by Citigroup.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
