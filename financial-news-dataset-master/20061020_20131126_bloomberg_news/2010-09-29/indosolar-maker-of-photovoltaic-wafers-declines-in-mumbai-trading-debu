Indosolar Ltd. , an Indian maker of
photovoltaic wafers, fell below its initial offer price on its
Mumbai trading debut.  Indosolar, which plunged as much as 22.1 percent in
intraday trading, fell 18.3 percent to 23.70 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. local time close. It raised 3.57 billion rupees ($79
million) selling shares at 29 rupees each in an initial sale
earlier this month.  The company, based in Greater Noida, near New Delhi, has an
annual capacity to manufacture solar cells to produce 160
megawatts of power. It will use proceeds from the share sale to
raise its capacity by another 100 megawatts by October 2011,
Managing Director H.R. Gupta said in Mumbai Sept. 8.  Indosolar , which also sells solar panels in Spain, Japan,
Canada and the U.S., is betting on demand from India’s national
solar mission, which plans to expand generating capacity to
20,000 megawatts by 2022. The company will divert most of its
production to meet domestic demand arising from the government
program to boost solar power, Gupta said.  The company reported a loss of 662 million rupees on sales
of 1.13 billion rupees in the year ended March 2010, according
to its offer document.  Of the 10 initial public offers in India in the last three
months, Indosolar shares are the second to decline on debut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
