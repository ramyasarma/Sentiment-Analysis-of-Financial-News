Indian stocks fell the most in a
month, led by  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd.  after a court
ordered its only smelter closed for breaching environment
standards.  Sterlite, the biggest copper and zinc producer, sank the
most in more than a year.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. , the nation’s
largest mobile-phone operator, dropped for the first time in
four days.  “The Sterlite issue may be impacting investor sentiment,”
said  Kishor Ostwal , managing director of  CNI Research  (India)
Ltd., a Mumbai-based publicly traded equities research provider.
“It’s not a good signal for foreign investors.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
fell for a second day, dropping 148.52, or 0.7 percent, to
19,956.34. The gauge is set for a seventh quarter of gains, its
best such rally. The measure has climbed 14 percent this year,
the best performer among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost
0.6 percent to 5,991.30. The  BSE 200 Index  dropped 0.6 percent
to 2526.72.  Sterlite plunged 8.4 percent to 161.4 rupees, its biggest
drop since January 2009. The company is waiting for the full
text of the order before it decides on a future course of action,
according to an e-mailed statement released after the order
yesterday.  Pavan Kaushik , a spokesman for parent  Vedanta
Resources Plc , couldn’t be reached immediately on his mobile
phone today.  Earnings, Shares  Closing the 400,000 metric ton a year smelter set up in
1996 will erode Sterlite’s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization margin by 8 percent and the share
price by 14 rupees, said  Deven Choksey , chief executive officer
at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt., which manages about
$123 million in equities.  Bharti lost 2.6 percent to 363.4 rupees, dropping from
yesterday’s highest level in almost a year. Oil & Natural Gas
Corp., India’s largest state-owned oil explorer, declined 2.5
percent to 1,421.35 rupees, retreating from its highest close in
at least 15 years.  International investors on Sept. 27 bought 13.1 billion
rupees ($291 million) more equities than they sold, increasing
their purchases to a record 834.7 billion rupees so far this
year, according to  data  compiled by the market regulator.  Foreign fund inflows to India’s equities have increased 55
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China.  Foreigners have invested 240.8 billion rupees in Indian
equities this month, lured by the fastest economic growth among
major economies in Asia after China. India’s gross domestic
product expanded 8.8 percent last quarter from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
