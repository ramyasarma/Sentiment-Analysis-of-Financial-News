LG Electronics Inc. may miss this
year’s goal to sell 7 million sets of flat-screen televisions
that use light-emitting diodes, or LED, as screen backlights,
said company spokeswoman Seye Im today. Demand has remained
weaker than expected because of high retail prices, with panel
costs staying high, she said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
