European Central Bank Vice
President Vitor Constancio said that the central bank is
monitoring bond spreads “very closely” as governments struggle
to restore investor confidence.   “The situation isn’t as acute as in May” when European
leaders pledged a rescue package for Greece, Constancio told
reporters at a conference in Frankfurt today. “Perhaps markets
are overreacting.”   He also said that he wouldn’t “characterize the situation
as a currency war,” and that there’s always been
“volatility.”   To contact the reporter on this story:
