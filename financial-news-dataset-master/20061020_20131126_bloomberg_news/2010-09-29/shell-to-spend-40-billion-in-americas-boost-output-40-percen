Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Europe’s
biggest oil company, plans to invest about $40 billion in the
Americas through 2014 to boost production by 40 percent.  Shell’s oil and gas output in the region may reach 1
million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the period, The
Hague-based company said in a statement.  Operations in the Americas have the potential to generate
over $10 billion in cash flow in 2012,  Simon Henry , the chief
financial officer at Shell, said in a  video interview  posted on
the Internet. It’s “a very good position to be in, very much
fits our global ambition for financial growth and the strategy
to allocate more capital” to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development region.  The company has spent more than $60 billion on extraction
projects and acquisitions in the Americas since 2004. Since
March,  Shell  has been assessing more than 35 projects worldwide
that may add 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources,
boosting production until 2020. Global project investments may
exceed $100 billion by 2014, Shell said March 16.  “Americas will be a key growth engine for Shell in the
years to come,” Shell Chief Executive  Peter Voser  said in the
statement distributed yesterday.  ‘Key’ Projects  Shell plans to start 13 “key” projects in 2010 and 2011,
 Matthias Bichsel , a director for projects and technology at
Shell, also said in a  video interview . Five of these projects
have already started, including the BC-10 in Brazil, Perdido in
the Gulf of Mexico, tight gas in North America, the Gbaran-Ubie
project in Nigeria and the expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands
Project in Canada.  Shell has been examining final investment decisions for
more than 20 projects in 2010 and 2011, Bichsel said. The
company has agreed to start work on the second phase of the BC-
10 deepwater project in Brazil.  Shell is tapping North American tight gas fields, which
have 40 trillion cubic feet of potential resources in hard-to-
reach rock formations, it said. Production of the fuel may
double to 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the period
between 2009 and 2015.  The Anglo-Dutch company added more than 500 million barrels
of oil equivalent resources in the Gulf of Mexico in 2009 and
2010, it said. It plans to pump more than 250,000 barrels a day
in the Gulf, it said, without giving a time frame.  Shell intends to sell at least $2 billion of producing
assets in the region in 2010 and 2011 as part of a $7 billion to
$8 billion global disposal plan, according to today’s statement.  “The Upstream Americas organization is well positioned for
profitable growth in Shell,”  Marvin Odum , director of
exploration and production at Shell in the Americas, said in
another  video interview  on the Internet. “This is a region with
substantial and diverse energy resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
