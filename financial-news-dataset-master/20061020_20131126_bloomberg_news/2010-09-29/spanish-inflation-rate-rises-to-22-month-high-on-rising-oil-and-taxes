Spain’s  inflation  rate rose in
September to the highest since 2008 as higher crude-oil costs
and an increase in sales tax pushed up prices.  Based on a European Union measure, consumer prices rose 2
percent from a year earlier more than the 1.8 percent increase
in August, the Madrid-based  National Statistics Institute  said
in a statement today. The figure was less than the median
forecast of 2.1 percent in a Bloomberg News  survey  of 11
economists.  The price of crude oil rose 14 percent in the 12 months
through Sept. 28, fueling higher costs across Europe. Even with
 Spain ’s economy contracting on an annual basis, the government
increased the main rate of value-added tax in July to 18 percent
from 16 percent as part of its efforts to reduce the third-
largest budget  deficit  in the euro region.  The institute is due to publish full details of this
month’s inflation on Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
