Morgan Stanley , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named  Eric Grossman , its general counsel
for the Americas, as global head of legal.  Grossman will oversee all of the firm’s advisory law and
litigation in the newly created position, according to an
internal memo from  Frank Barron , who joined the New York-based
company in July as chief legal officer.  Jeanmarie McFadden , a
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, confirmed the contents of the memo,
which was obtained today by Bloomberg News.  Grossman, who also previously was global head of litigation
and general counsel for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, was named
to the firm’s management committee in July. He joined the
company in 2006 shortly after  Gary Lynch , who he had worked for
at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, became Morgan Stanley’s chief
legal officer. Grossman had been a candidate to replace Lynch, a
person briefed on the matter said in February.  Morgan Stanley also named  Anne Cooney  general counsel of
its brokerage unit, according to the memo. Cooney had previously
been Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s deputy general counsel.  Jim Mangan  and  Scott Tucker  were named co-heads of litigation,
according to the memo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
