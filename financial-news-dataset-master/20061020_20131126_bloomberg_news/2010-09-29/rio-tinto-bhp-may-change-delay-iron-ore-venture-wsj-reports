Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton
Ltd. are considering changes or a delay to their planned $116
billion iron-ore venture in Australia, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  A postponement of the venture, which the two companies had
hoped to be approved by the end of the year, may allow time for
the terms of Australia’s minerals tax to be set, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
