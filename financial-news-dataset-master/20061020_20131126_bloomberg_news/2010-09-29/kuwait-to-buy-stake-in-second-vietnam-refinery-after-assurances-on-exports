Kuwait intends to keep its 35.1
percent stake in Vietnam’s second refinery, planned to be ready
in 2014, the middle eastern country’s oil minister said.  “We got assurance today that the government is serious
about giving us all the necessary agreements or approvals,”
 Sheikh Ahmad al-Abdullah al-Sabah  said today in the Vietnamese
capital Hanoi. “Once the refinery is completed, it’s assured
that there will be exports of 200,000 barrels of crude oil to
Vietnam.”  Japanese oil refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co. and its partners
delayed a decision on investing $5.8 billion in the refinery,
putting off its potential start date to 2014, the company said
Sept. 17. Idemitsu and Kuwait Petroleum International Ltd. each
have a 35.1 percent stake in the 200,000 barrel-a-day project at
Nghi Son, while state-controlled Vietnam Oil & Gas Group holds
25.1 percent and Mitsui Chemicals Inc. has 4.7 percent.  Kuwait hopes the Vietnamese government will approve the
project “within the next few weeks,” said Sheikh Ahmad, who is
visiting the country to speed up negotiations on the plant.  Vietnam’s first oil refinery, which started commercial
production at Dung Quat in February last year, has the capacity
to supply 148,000 barrels a day, a third of the country’s 2010
fuel demand. Previously, the Southeast Asian nation imported
almost all of its oil products.  To contact the Bloomberg Staff on this story:
