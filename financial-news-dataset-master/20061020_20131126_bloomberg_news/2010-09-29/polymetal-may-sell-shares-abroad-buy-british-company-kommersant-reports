OAO Polymetal, Russia’s largest
silver producer, may sell shares to investors in the U.S. or
Canada, Kommersant reported.  Another alternative Polymetal is considering to broaden its
investor base is to buy a U.K. company through which it can do a
so-called reverse takeover and become a British company, the
Moscow-based newspaper said today, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.   The board of the St. Petersburg-based company will discuss
the options at a meeting today, Kommersant said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
