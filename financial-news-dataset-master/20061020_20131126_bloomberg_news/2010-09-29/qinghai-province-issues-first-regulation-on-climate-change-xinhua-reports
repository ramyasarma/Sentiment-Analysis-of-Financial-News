Qinghai has become the first
Chinese province to promulgate regulations making local

with climate change, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The rules require government and state-owned company
officials to be evaluated on energy savings, emissions
reduction, water resource conservation and other climate change-
related criteria, Xinhua said, citing the regulations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
