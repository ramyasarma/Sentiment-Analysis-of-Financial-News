Former allies of Italian Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi who split from his party in July said
they will support the government in a confidence vote in
parliament today.  “We will vote yes,” European Affairs Minister Andrea
Ronchi told reporters today after Berlusconi addressed
parliament. The premier’s speech “touched on many issues that
we have wanted to have addressed for some time.”  Ronchi belongs to a group of supporters that split from
Berlusconi’s party and supports Gianfranco Fini, the Chamber of
Deputies speaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
