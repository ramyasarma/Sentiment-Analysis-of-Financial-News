Gilead Sciences Inc . said it
received a warning letter from U.S. regulators citing its San
Dimas, California, plant for inadequate manufacturing procedures
including the failure to prevent possible contamination.  The  Food and Drug Administration  cited “inadequacies” in
the manufacturing of Gilead’s AmBisome, a treatment for severe
fungal infections, the Foster City, California-based company
said today in a regulatory filing. An inspection done in January
and February found deficiencies included control systems and
monitoring, contamination control procedures, and cleaning and
equipment maintenance, Gilead said.  Gilead, the world’s biggest maker of AIDS drugs, markets
AmBisome in the U.S. with Japan’s  Astellas Pharma Inc.  The drug
generated $299 million in 2009 for Gilead and $67 million for
Astellas in the fiscal year ended in March 2010. Gilead said it
doesn’t believe the warning letter issued Sept. 24 will affect
supply of Atripla, Emtriva, Hepsera, Letairis, Ranexa, Truvada
or Viread drugs.  “We are working diligently to resolve any outstanding FDA
concerns listed in the warning letter,”  Nathan Kaiser , a Gilead
spokesman, said today in an e-mail.  The FDA may not allow Gilead to export AmBisome to certain
countries outside the U.S. and Europe unless the company can
resolve the issues with the agency, the company said.  Gilead shares fell 1.4 percent to $35.35 at 5:32 p.m. New
York time in extended  trading  on the Nasdaq Stock Market after
declining 27 cents, to $35.87, at the 4 p.m. close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
