Canada may report a “negative”
figure tomorrow for July’s  gross domestic product , Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  said.  “We may see a figure for July tomorrow that is negative,
but in July a lot of things happened in Canada, like the
introduction of the HST in two of the largest provinces,”
Flaherty told reporters today in Ottawa, referring to changes in
the provincial sales tax in Ontario and British Columbia.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict a 0.1 percent
 decline  for July, according to the median of 22 responses. A
slowing economy may make it more difficult for Flaherty to
achieve his plan of reducing the country’s budget deficit.  Canada’s deficit may exceed a prior estimate of C$53.8
billion ($52.1 billion) for the fiscal year that ended March 31
because of accounting rules regarding payments made after two
provinces harmonized their sales taxes with a federal levy,
Flaherty also said.  “It may because of some accounting issues that we have,
and we’ve had discussions with the Auditor General about that,”
Flaherty said.  Flaherty next week will lead a meeting in Washington of
finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven
nations, he told reporters. Flaherty said conversations with
colleagues in advance of the meeting indicate that “currency
issues are major issues.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
