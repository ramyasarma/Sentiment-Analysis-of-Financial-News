PT Pertamina plans to acquire PT
Medco Energi Internasional, Ferederick Siahaan, a director at
Pertamina said by telephone today.  The state-owned oil producer may buy a stake in Medco’s
parent company Encore Energy Ltd., Siahaan said. Pertamina wants
Medco to “spin off” its non-oil and gas units before
proceeding with an acquisition, he said. Pertamina is also
considering a merger and joint operations with Medco, Siahaan
said. Medco Director Lukman Mahfoedz didn’t return a call to his
mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
