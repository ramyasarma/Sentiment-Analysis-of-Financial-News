Adair Turner , the chairman of the
U.K. Financial Services Authority, said big banks should face
higher capital requirements than smaller lenders, since the
risks in the event of bankruptcy are greater,  Les Echos 
reported, citing an interview.  Turner told the newspaper that, when big lenders fail, they
need an alternative to traditional bankruptcy procedures, to
minimize damage to the economy.  It’s “very improbable” that banks such as  Barclays Plc ,
 HSBC Holdings Plc  or  Standard Chartered Plc  would leave the U.K.
because of stricter rules, and a financial transactions tax is
something that can be debated, Les Echos cited Turner as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
