Tata Steel Ltd., India’s biggest
producer of the alloy, said it obtained 3.53 billion pounds
($5.6 billion) of loans to replace the debt used to buy Corus
Group Plc in 2007.  The refinancing for the company’s U.K. unit consists of a
five-year term loan of about 1.8 billion pounds; a 1 billion
pound, seven-year term loan; and a 690 million-pound five-year
revolving credit line, Mumbai-based Tata Steel said today in a
statement. Tata Steel UK Holdings took out 3.6 billion pounds of
loans in 2007 for the $12.9 billion acquisition of Corus,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The new financing pays an average interest rate of “mid-
300 basis points” more than benchmark lending rates, Koushik
Chatterjee, Tata Steel’s chief financial officer, said today in
an e-mailed reply to questions from Bloomberg. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The facilities, which have looser financial covenants,
allow Tata Steel to minimize loan repayments for the next five
years and boost capital expenditures in Europe, according to the
statement. Tata Steel has repaid about 900 million pounds of
debt in the last 18 months, the company said.  “In the current global financing environment, the terms of
this refinancing are exceptional for their flexibility and
attractiveness to the business,” Chatterjee said in the
statement.  The steelmaker agreed to pay interest margins as much as
275 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, for the loans taken in 2007, which would have matured
between 2012 and 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
