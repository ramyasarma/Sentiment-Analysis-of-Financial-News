South Africa’s benchmark 13.5
percent government bond due September 2015 extended gains after
a report showed inflation eased for an eighth consecutive month.  The price of the so-called R157 bond rose 8 cents to 125.97
rand, reducing the yield by 2 basis points to 7.17 percent as of
11:36 a.m. in Johannesburg.  Consumer price growth slowed to 3.5 percent in August, from
3.7 percent in July, the Pretoria-based statistics office said
on its website today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
was for a 3.6 percent inflation reading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
