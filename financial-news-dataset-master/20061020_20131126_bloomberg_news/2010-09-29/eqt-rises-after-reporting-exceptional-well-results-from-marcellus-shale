EQT Corp. , the largest natural-gas
producer in the Appalachian Basin, rose in New York trading
after announcing “exceptional” results from two Pennsylvania
wells in the Marcellus Shale formation.  EQT climbed $1.59, or 4.6 percent, to $35.98 as of 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The  stock  has
dropped 18 percent this year.  A well drilled in Greene County had an average  production 
rate equivalent to 22 million cubic feet of gas a day,
Pittsburgh-based EQT said today in a statement. The company
estimated ultimate recoveries from the site at 18 billion cubic
feet of gas.  “This is likely the most productive well that we’ve seen
in the Marcellus to date,” said  Scott Hanold , an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets in Minneapolis who has an “outperform” rating
on EQT shares and owns none.  EQT said a well in Armstrong County had an initial output
rate equivalent to 15 million cubic feet of gas a day.  “The results in Armstrong County, where  EQT  holds nearly
34,000 acres, are especially encouraging as this well employed a
new completion design resulting in initial flow rates
significantly better than nearby wells completed
conventionally,”  Steven Schlotterbeck , president of exploration
and production at EQT, said in the statement.  EQT  is among the producers using fracturing technology in
U.S. shale formations to break up rock and help gas flow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
