Asian  stocks  rose, lifting the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to a five-month high, as manufacturing in
China accelerated and a Bank of Japan survey spurred speculation
the central bank will take steps to bolster economic growth.  Jiangxi Copper Co.  climbed 3.8 percent in Hong Kong after a
Chinese purchasing managers index increased in September.  Elpida
Memory Inc.  climbed 8.1 percent after saying it plans to start
mass production of a new memory chip. Shinsei Bank Ltd. jumped
6.9 percent in Tokyo after boosting its profit forecast.  Lee &

of 7:41 p.m. in Tokyo, the highest level since April 16. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 0.7 percent in Japan, where the
central bank reported its Tankan index of sentiment at the
nation’s largest manufacturers climbed by 7 points in September,
the least since early 2009. Japanese bonds rose for a sixth day.  “There is rising speculation of monetary easing in the
market after the Tankan survey sparked uncertainty about the
future of Japan’s economy,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $111 billion. “A rise in PMI reassured investors
about the strength of the Chinese economy.”  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.2 percent. China’s
Shanghai Composite closed little changed after advancing 0.9
percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.6 percent, as did
Taiwan’s Taiex index.  Fed Speculation  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.2 percent.
The index rose 0.5 percent yesterday as Walgreen Co., the
largest U.S. drugstore chain, led a rally in consumer-staples
and health companies, and investors speculated the Federal
Reserve will buy more debt to safeguard the economy.  A  Chicago purchasing managers ’ gauge of business activity
due tomorrow is forecast to fall to 55.7 this month from 56.7 in
August, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  A China purchasing managers’ index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics rose to 52.9 this month from
51.9 in August, helping to boost Hong Kong and Chinese equities.
A separate  government-backed PMI  is due released on Oct. 1.  “Domestic demand is pretty strong,” said  Dai Ming , a fund
manager at Shanghai Kingsun Investment Management & Consulting
Co. “That has paved the way for a soft landing of the
economy.”  Mining Stocks  Jiangxi Copper climbed 3.8 percent to HK$19.58 in Hong Kong.

net-income target for the year ending March 2012 to 51 billion
yen ($608 million) from 32 billion yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index tumbled as much as 16 percent
from this year’s high on April 15 to its 2010 low on May 25 amid
concern Europe’s debt crisis and Chinese steps to curb property-
price inflation will derail global growth. The index has since
climbed 17 percent. The gauge’s  companies  trade at an average
14.3 times estimated profit, the highest level in seven weeks.  “Corporate earnings look good for now,” Daiwa Asset’s
Nagano said. “Growth at the moment looks ok but there is
uncertainty about the future.”  Land Auctions  Lee & Man surged 11 percent to HK$6.35. The company plans

sold a residential site in the city’s Fan Ling district for
HK$459 million ($59 million), beating the HK$370 million median
estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Henderson Land Development Co. , controlled by billionaire
Lee Shau-kee, rose 1.7 percent to HK$54.65.  Hang Lung Properties
Ltd. , Hong Kong’s third-biggest homebuilder, advanced 3.5
percent to HK$36.90. Some developers pared gains after the
government withdrew a site in the Chai Wan district from auction
after receiving no bids at the starting price of HK$530 million.  Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang has increased
sales of government land in a bid to curb home values that have
 surged  46 percent in the past year. Prices have exceeded

measures to cool the property market Aug. 13.  A measure of utility companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index declined 1.4 percent, the only decline among the broader
gauge’s industry groups.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. , Asia’s largest utility, slumped
7.8 percent to 2,105 yen in Tokyo, after the Nikkei newspaper
reported the company may sell shares. After Japan’s stock market
closed, Tokyo Electric announced plans to raise as much as 555
billion yen ($6.6 billion) from a stock sale to finance
expansion of atomic plants at home and abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
