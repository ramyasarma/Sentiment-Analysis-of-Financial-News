Telstra Corp. will cut at least
6,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its workforce, over three years as
the company seeks to return earnings to last year’s levels, the
Australian Financial Review said. Other positions will also be
removed through natural attrition, making the rate of job cuts
comparable with the 12,000 positions lost over four and a half
years under former Chief Executive Sol Trujillo, the newspaper
reported, without without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
