Eli Lilly & Co. , the world’s
biggest maker of psychiatric drugs, sued two U.K. units of drug
distributer  Celesio AG  for allegedly infringing its patent for
the schizophrenia drug Zyprexa two years ago.  Celesio’s  Lloyds Pharmacy  and Aah Pharmaceuticals 
businesses sold about 800,000 tablets of generic Zyprexa before
agreeing in 2008 to halt sales, Eli Lilly said in a complaint
filed in the High Court in London on Aug. 18 and made public
last week.  Eli Lilly, based in Indianapolis, took legal action two
years ago against “a number of companies” to stop sales of the
generic known as olanzapine, according to an e-mailed statement
yesterday from  Edward Sagebiel , an Eli Lilly spokesman. The
sales ended after Eli Lilly’s patent expiration won an extension
until Sept. 26, 2011, according to the complaint.  The lawsuit “has been undertaken by Lilly to obtain its
damages as a result of the sale of those products” in 2008,
Sagebiel said.  Lloyds Pharmacy agreed to halt the sales “and hold the
remainder of the stock in quarantine,” Sarah Stokes, a
spokeswoman for Lloyds Pharmacy, said in an e-mail. The lawsuit
relates to a single batch of olanzapine that Lloyds Pharmacy
purchased and the company is no longer selling it, she said.  Dean Enon, a spokesman for Coventry, England-based Aah
Pharmaceuticals, referred calls to Stokes.  The case is: Eli Lilly v. AAH Pharmaceuticals, Lloyds
Pharmacy, High Court of London, Chancery Division, No.
