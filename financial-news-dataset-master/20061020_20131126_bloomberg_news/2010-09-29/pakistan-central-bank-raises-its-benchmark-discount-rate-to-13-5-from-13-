Pakistan’s central bank raised
interest rates for the second time in two months to cool

crops, roads and bridges.  The State Bank of Pakistan increased the discount rate to
13.5 percent from 13 percent, Syed Wasimuddin, a central bank
spokesman said in Karachi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
