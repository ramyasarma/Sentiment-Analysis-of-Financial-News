The Building Societies Association ,
which represents the U.K.’s 49 customer-owned lenders, urged the
Financial Services Authority to rethink plans to restrict
interest-only mortgages saying they risk stifling the market.  Forcing lenders to make regular checks on borrowers’
ability to pay will push up borrowing costs and limit choice for
consumers, the Building Society Association said in a statement
today in response to proposals the U.K. regulator made in July.
The tightening of the rules may lead many lenders to withdraw
from the market, the London-based BSA said.  “Interest-only mortgages are not in themselves inherently
bad or high-risk and the industry has been attentive about
restricting their availability to suitable customers,” said
Paul Broadhead, the head of mortgage policy at the Building
Society Association in the statement.  The British financial watchdog published a  report  in July
proposing stricter tests for borrowers of interest-only
mortgages to ensure they have sufficient money to repay the
loans.  Michael Coogan , director general of the Council of
Mortgage Lenders, said in a speech last week that interest-only
mortgages may disappear altogether because of the FSA proposals.  The U.K. regulator is tightening rules after a decade-long
housing boom ended in 2007 leading homeowners to default and a
drop in property prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
