Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, sold $1 billion of 3.25-year U.S.
dollar-denominated notes, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The 1.125 percent notes were priced at 99.853 cents on the
dollar to yield 1.171 percent, the data show.  The lender, based in Toronto, may have its long-term debt
ratings downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service because of its
reliance on capital markets for growth, according to a Sept. 14
statement from Moody’s. The ratings firm will focus its review
on Royal Bank’s “commitment to capital markets and its growth
plans for the business,” according to the statement.  The bank is rated Aaa for long-term deposits and senior
debt, the highest level at Moody’s. Standard & Poor’s ranks the
issuer AA-, three levels lower.  Barclays Capital managed the note sale with RBC Capital
Markets, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
