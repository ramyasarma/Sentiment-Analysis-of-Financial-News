Tin production in China may be
restricted through the end of the year because of limitations on
power, tin industry group ITRI Ltd. said.  The two largest tin smelters in China are closed, ITRI’s
Peter Kettle said in an e-mail today. “Supply constraints are
also indicated by the latest Indonesian export data and the
large number of canceled London Metal Exchange warrants
signaling further imminent withdrawals of stocks from
warehouses,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
