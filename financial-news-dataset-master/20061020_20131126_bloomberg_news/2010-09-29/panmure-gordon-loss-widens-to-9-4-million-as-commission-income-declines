Panmure Gordon & Co. , the 134 year-
old U.K. stockbroker, reported a widening first-half loss of
5.96 million pounds ($9.44 million), citing lower commission
income.  The company, which also named  Edmond Warner  as non-
executive chairman, had posted a net loss of 3.65 million pounds
in the first half of 2009, London-based Panmure Gordon said in a
statement today. “The first half results reflect the tough
trading environment, however the company looks to the second
half with confidence”, Warner said. Commission income was
“much reduced,” the company said.  Evolution Group Plc , a London-based rival, said on Sept. 23
it’s considering an offer for smaller Panmure Gordon. Brokers in
the U.K. are seeking to consolidate after the financial crisis
curbed financing for takeovers, hurting revenue from advising on
fundraisings and mergers.  “Despite the very difficult markets, we completed a number
of deals for clients, though the transaction sizes were lower
than in previous years” for U.K. investment banking, Panmure
Gordon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
