John Carney  is returning to kick
for the New Orleans Saints at the age of 46, a move that comes
after  Garrett Hartley  missed an overtime field goal in the
team’s 27-24 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.  Carney’s agent, Jack Mills, said in an e-mail that Carney
signed a contract and is expected to join the Saints today.  Carney is a 22-year National Football League veteran whose
473 field goals and 2,044 points are both the third-most in
history. He worked out for the Saints yesterday, two days after
Hartley missed a 29-yard field-goal attempt against Atlanta that
would have given New Orleans the victory.  Carney was signed by the Saints last season after Hartley
was suspended for four games by the NFL for violating substance-
abuse rules. He appeared in 11 games and made 13 of 17 field
goal attempts before Hartley reclaimed the job. Carney remained
with New Orleans as a kicking consultant as the Saints won their
first Super Bowl title.  Hartley kicked a 40-yard field goal in overtime to beat
Minnesota in last year’s National Football Conference
championship game and send the Saints to the Super Bowl. He then
became the first kicker to make three field goals longer than 40
yards in a Super Bowl as the Saints beat the Indianapolis Colts
31-17.  The 24-year-old Hartley has made four of seven field-goal
attempts this season.  Carney could be the third player  over the age of 45  to
appear in an NFL game, joining  Morten Andersen  (47) and  George Blanda  (48), according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s
website. Blanda died two days ago at age 83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
