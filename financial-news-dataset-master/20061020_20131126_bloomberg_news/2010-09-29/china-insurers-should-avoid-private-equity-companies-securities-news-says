Chinese insurers should refrain
from setting up or buying into private-equity companies now
although a recent regulation allows them to do so, the
 Securities Times  reported, citing the regulator.  China’s private-equity market is underdeveloped, lacks
effective supervision and laws, and the riskiness and opaqueness
of such investments don’t fit the needs of insurance funds, the
Chinese-language newspaper said today, citing China Insurance
Regulatory Commission Vice Chairman Yang Mingsheng.  Insurers shouldn’t engage in real estate development or
land speculation under the disguise of building so-called
“pension communities” for retired people, Yang was cited as
telling a regulatory meeting in Beijing.  Some insurers have been stockpiling land and making big
plans in a blind pursuit of opportunities in the pension-
community area, Yang said, according to the report.  -- Zhang Dingmin . Editors: Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
