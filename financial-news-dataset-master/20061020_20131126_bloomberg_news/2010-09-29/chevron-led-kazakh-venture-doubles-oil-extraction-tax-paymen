Chevron Corp.’s Kazakh oil venture,
the country’s biggest exporter of the fuel, more than doubled
crude extraction tax payments as the government seeks a larger
share of resource revenue.  TengizChevroil paid 245.2 billion tenge ($1.7 billion) in
the first seven months, compared with 122 billion tenge in all
of 2009, according to data published on the Finance Ministry’s
Tax Committee website, without elaboration.  Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world’s oil
reserves according to BP Plc, introduced the extraction tax,
replacing royalty payments, to boost revenue and narrow a budget
deficit. The government started levying export taxes on crude
oil from the venture led by  Chevron , in the government’s latest
effort to gain more from the country’s energy wealth. The
Central Asian nation raised the oil export tax to $20 a metric
ton ($2.73 a barrel) in August and plans to double that to $40
starting next year.  TengizChevroil increased oil production to 12.5 million
tons in the first half, more than a half of the 22.5 million
tons it produced in 2009, the company said on its website.  The venture’s total tax burden rose to 514 billion tenge
through July from 452 billion tenge in all of 2009, the tax
committee said. The venture paid 248 billion tenge in corporate
income tax, compared with 294 billion tenge for all of 2009,
according to the statement.  Linsi Crain , an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for TengizChevroil
wasn’t immediately available for comment. Raikhan Sharipova, a
spokeswoman for tax committee, declined to comment immediately.  Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent, state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent and Lukarco, owned by
Russia’s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
