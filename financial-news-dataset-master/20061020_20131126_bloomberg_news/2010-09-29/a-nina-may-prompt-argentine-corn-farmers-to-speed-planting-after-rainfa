Corn farmers in Argentina, the
world’s second-largest exporter of the commodity, will probably
speed planting to take advantage of above-average rainfall
before a dry spell begins, the Cordoba Cereals Exchange said.  “Farmers are likely to start planting corn at an earlier
time than in other years to take advantage of the humidity” from
rain in the past week, Silvina Fiant, a forecaster at the
exchange, said today by telephone from Cordoba province. “Rain
this year is falling earlier than in other years.”  Growers may seek to plant early so crops can withstand
drier weather expected in December and January because of the La
Nina weather pattern, she said. Central Cordoba got about 81.1
millimeters (3.2 inches) of rain in the four weeks through
yesterday,  data published on the exchange’s website  show. That’s
above the historical average, Fiant said.  Cordoba farmers this year will plant about 800,000 hectares
(1.98 million acres) of corn, a third of the country’s total,
according to an estimate by the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange.
Argentina’s total output may reach 26 million metric tons,
 Martin Fraguio , head of the Maizar corn growers’ association,
said Aug. 31.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $5.0225 a bushel at 11:14 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
