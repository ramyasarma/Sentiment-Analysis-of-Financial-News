Germany’s opposition Green Party
dropped one percentage point from a record 24 percent in a
weekly Forsa poll for Hamburg-based Stern magazine as Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s government coalition gained support.  The Greens won 23 percent of voter favor while Merkel’s
Christian Democrats and their CSU Bavarian allies gained one
percentage point to 30 percent, and the FDP coalition partner
remained at 5 percent, according to the poll.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
