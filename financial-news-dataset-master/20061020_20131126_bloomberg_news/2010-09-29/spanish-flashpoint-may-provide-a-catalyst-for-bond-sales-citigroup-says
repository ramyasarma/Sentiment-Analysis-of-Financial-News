Spanish  government bonds  are
“overpriced” and may drop this week as the nation faces a
possible downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service and opposition
to the nation’s economic plans, according to Citigroup Inc.  Spain “has enjoyed the absence of a catalyst to correct
its pricing out of step with its fundamentals,” Robert Crossley , a fixed-income strategist in London, wrote in a
research note today. “A disappointing budget combined with an
effective general strike and a rating review on Sept. 30 could
supply that catalyst. At the very least, we think it would be
prudent to lighten up on Spanish exposure, at least over the
Sept. 30 potential flashpoint.”  Spanish 10-year bonds were little changed, with the yield
at 4.22 percent, as of 8:38 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
