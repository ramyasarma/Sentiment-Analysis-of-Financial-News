Ryan Hall  withdrew from next
month’s  Chicago Marathon  where he planned to make a run at the
American record for the 26.2-mile distance, the Chicago Tribune
 reported .  Hall, 27, the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials marathon winner,
said he had some poor workouts over the past week, the newspaper
reported. Leading up to the Oct. 10 race, Hall had said he
wanted to break  Khalid Khannouchi ’s U.S. record of 2 hours, 5
minutes, 38 seconds, set at the 2002 London Marathon.  “It has been a rough couple months for me,” Hall told the
Tribune. “I’ve invested everything in my training, and
sometimes things do not turn out the way you had envisioned.”  Hall finished 14th at the Sept. 19 Philadelphia Half
Marathon, four minutes slower than his career-best time at the
13.1-mile distance. He was the top American finisher in this
year’s Boston Marathon, finishing fourth at 2:08:41, the fastest
for an American in the race’s history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
