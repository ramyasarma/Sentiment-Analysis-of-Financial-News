Alten SA confirmed its target for
full-year like-for-like sales growth of above 5 percent as
first-half profit jumped.  Net income in the first six months was 25.2 million euros
versus 0.2 million euros a year earlier, the technology
consulting company said in a statement in Les Echos. The full-
year sales target assumes the economic environment remains the
same, Alten said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
