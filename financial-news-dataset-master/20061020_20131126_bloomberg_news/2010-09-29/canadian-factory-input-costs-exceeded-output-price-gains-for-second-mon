Canadian factory raw-material costs
rose faster than the prices of finished products for a second
month in August, government figures showed.  The  raw-materials price  index rose 2.2 percent on non-
ferrous metals, following a July gain of 1.9 percent, Statistics
Canada said today from Ottawa. Economists predicted a 0.5
percent increase for August according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists.  The  industrial product price index  rose 0.4 percent in
August from July, and was unchanged during the previous month,
Statistics Canada said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 14 economists was for a 0.2 percent monthly increase.  The figures suggest that factory profit margins narrowed in
August.  Factory sales  fell for a second month in July, a Sept.
15 Statistics Canada report showed.  The cost of factory materials has also grown faster than
product prices over the 12 months ending in August, with gains
of 5 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively.  Statistics Canada today reset the base year for both
indexes, giving them each a value of 100 in the year 2002. The
weights given to the components such as coal and paper were also
reset to reflect factory production in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
