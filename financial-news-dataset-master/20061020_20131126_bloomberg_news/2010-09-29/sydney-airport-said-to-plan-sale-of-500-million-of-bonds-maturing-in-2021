Sydney Airport Finance Co. Pty
Ltd. , the finance arm of Australia’s largest airport, plans to
sell $500 million of bonds maturing in 2021, according to a
person familiar with the transaction.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are managing the sale of
notes, which may price later this week, the person said, asking
not to be named as the matter is private.  The bonds will carry conditions that investors would
receive extra interest if the credit rating is cut, the person
said.  Sydney Airport is majority-owned by  MAp Group , an
Australian-listed company that also owns stakes in airports in
Copenhagen and Brussels, according to its website. Officials
from the airport met with debt investors in Hong Kong, Singapore
and the U.S. earlier this month, another person said Sept. 17.  Sydney Airport Finance Co. has about A$280 million ($271
million) of bonds due next year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It sold A$175 million of five-year notes in July as
part of a buyback and exchange transaction, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
