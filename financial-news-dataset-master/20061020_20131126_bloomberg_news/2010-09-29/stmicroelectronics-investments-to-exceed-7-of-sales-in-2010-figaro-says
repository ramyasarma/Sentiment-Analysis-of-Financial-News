STMicroelectronics NV, Europe’s
biggest chipmaker, will increase investments to more than 7
percent of sales this year to meet rebounding chip demand, Le
Figaro reported, citing Chief Operating Officer Alain Dutheil.  The company is lifting production capacity by 20 percent,
Dutheil was cited as saying. Investments were limited to 5
percent of sales in 2009, the newspaper said.  STMicroelectronics has secured a loan of 350 million euros
from the European Investment Bank to help fund investments, Le
Figaro said, citing EIB vice-president Philippe de Fontaine
Vive.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
