Platinum may advance to $1,750 an
ounce this year and investors should “buy the dip,” according
to technical analysts at Barclays Capital.  As long as the price doesn’t close below $1,592 an ounce,
platinum is likely to target the $1,750 area reached in April
and May, they said in a report dated Sept. 27. “A small
divergence signal suggests a correction is likely before the
recent uptrend resumes,” the report said.  Platinum, used for jewelry and pollution-control devices,
has gained 13 percent this year, while silver climbed 29 percent
and gold increased 19 percent. Investors bought precious metals
on speculation governments will add to monetary easing to
sustain the recovery, weakening currencies. Platinum added 0.6
percent to $1,647.75 an ounce at 11:34 a.m. in Singapore today.  While the outlook for precious metals was “generally
bright recently, the platinum rally has been less convincing
than moves elsewhere,” said the report. “We are not at all
surprised that the combination of trendline/retracement and
projection levels between $1,653/$1,655 has proved impenetrable
at the first time of asking,” it said.  Resistance levels for platinum are $1,655, $1,663 and
$1,689 an ounce and support levels are $1,609, $1,595 and $1,567,
the report said.  -- Helen Sun . Editor:  James Poole   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
