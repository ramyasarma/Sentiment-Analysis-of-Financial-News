The European Commission, regulator
of the world’s largest carbon market, will sign an agreement by
mid-October with the European Investment Bank on selling
emission permits, Maria Kokkonen, a climate spokeswoman, said in
a telephone interview today.  Both institutions are now “fine-tuning” the agreement,
Kokkonen said.  The EU has already agreed to provide as many as 300 million
carbon allowances from the next phase of its emissions-trading
system that starts 2013, which could be used to finance less
polluting, innovative technologies. Permits set aside in the New
Entrants Reserve will be sold by the EIB and proceeds will be
used to support carbon capture and storage and renewable energy
projects, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
