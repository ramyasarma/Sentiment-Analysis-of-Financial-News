A fuel spill in the St. Lawrence
River at  Suncor Energy Inc. ’s Montreal refinery has been
contained, a city fire official said.  City fire crews surrounded the spill with booms in the Port
of Montreal area, Benoit Fleury, the Montreal Fire Department’s
chief of operations, said today in a telephone interview. The
spill is estimated to be 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) long by 50
feet wide, he said.  “Environment Quebec and Environment Canada are on the
scene taking care of the situation with Suncor to pick up the
leftovers from the spill,” Fleury said.  The fire department’s hazardous materials crew was called
to the plant at 8:40 p.m. local time yesterday and contained the
spill by 2 a.m., Fleury said. The spill presented no danger to
the public from a fire or explosion, he said.  A leak of a mixture of diesel and water was found at the
port, Michael Southern, a Suncor spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. “The source of the leak has been stopped,” he said.  Suncor, Canada’s largest oil company, produces 130,000-
barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products from
the  refinery , according to the Calgary-based company’s website.  A telephone call to Environment Canada wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
