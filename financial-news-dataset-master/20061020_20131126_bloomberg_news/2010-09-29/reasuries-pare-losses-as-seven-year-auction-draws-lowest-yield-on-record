Treasuries  pared losses as the
government sold $29 billion of seven-year notes at the lowest
yield on record.  The sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
3.04, compared with an average of 2.84 at the past 10 auctions.
The yield was 1.890 percent, compared with the 1.899 percent
average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 7 of the Federal
Reserve’s 18 primary dealers.  “The market is expecting the Fed will be increasing its
balance sheet sometime in the near future,” said  Gary Pollack ,
who helps oversee $12 billion as head of fixed-income trading at
Deutsche Bank AG’s private wealth management unit in New York,
before the auction.  Current seven-year note  yields  gained 1 basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.85 percent at 1:08 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The 10-year  note yield  added
1 basis point to 2.48 percent.  At today’s sale, indirect bidders, an investor class that
includes foreign central banks, purchased 50.2 percent of the
notes, compared with 56.7 percent at the last auction on Aug. 26
and an average of 50 percent at the past 10 sales. Seven-year
notes drew a then record-low yield of 1.989 percent at last
month’s auction.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 13.4 percent,
compared with 8.6 percent in August.  The Treasury resumed seven-year note auctions in February
2009 after ending them in April 1993. The government sold
$35 billion in five-year debt yesterday after selling
$36 billion in two-year securities on Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
