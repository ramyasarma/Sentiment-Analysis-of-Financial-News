The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’  crude-oil output fell to an eight-month low
in September, led by Iraq, where a pipeline disruption curtailed
shipments, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Production slipped 145,000 barrels, or 0.5 percent, to an
average 29.055 million barrels a day, the lowest level since
January, according to the survey. Output by members with quotas,
all except Iraq, dropped 95,000 barrels to 26.76 million, 1.92
million above their target.  Iraqi output  dropped 50,000 barrels, or 2.1 percent, to
2.295 million this month, the biggest decrease in OPEC and the
lowest level since October, 2008. The Persian Gulf nation was
the group’s fourth-largest producer in September. Production
from Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, fell 40,000 barrels.  “Both the Iraqi and Saudi cuts are probably temporary and
not a sign of an enduring trend,” said  Peter Beutel , the
president of energy advisory firm Cameron Hanover Inc. in New
Canaan, Connecticut. “Iraqi production has been erratic for
years so we’re used to it. The Saudi numbers are of more
interest, but are probably due to seasonal maintenance.”  Iraq’s crude oil exports through Turkey dropped by about 20
percent due to a technical fault on the Iraqi side of the border
on Sept. 24, said Imad Baqer, head of production for the state-
run North Oil Co. Shipments stopped completely on Sept. 28 and
resumed yesterday.  Saudi Arabia reduced production to 8.25 million barrels a
day, the second-biggest decline in the group and the lowest
output since March. The kingdom exceeded its quota by 199,000
barrels a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
