PSA Peugeot Citroen Chief Executive
Officer Philippe Varin told Le Figaro in an interview that he
expects China to become the company’s largest market.  Sales in China should exceed 350,000 units this year,
meaning that they have doubled since 2008, Varin told the
newspaper. The company is seeking a Chinese market share of 8
percent with partners between 2015 and 2020, Varin said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
