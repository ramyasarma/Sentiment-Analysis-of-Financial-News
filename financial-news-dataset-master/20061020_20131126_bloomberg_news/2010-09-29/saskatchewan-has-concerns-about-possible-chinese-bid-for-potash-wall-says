The Canadian province of
Saskatchewan has concerns about a possible acquisition of  Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  by China, Premier  Brad Wall  said.  “They are a major purchasing country and we have concerns
about that type of arrangement,” Wall said today at a news
conference in Saskatoon. “China has done a good job of
balancing its interests.”  Sinochem Group, China’s largest fertilizer trader, has
emerged as the likeliest bidder to rival Melbourne-based  BHP
Billiton Ltd. ’s $40 billion offer for Potash Corp., three people
familiar with the matter said on Sept. 27. Potash has rejected
BHP’s bid as too low and said it was seeking other offers.  Saskatchewan has worked to attract investment from China in
other areas in the past, Wall said today. Still, the Potash deal
requires extra scrutiny “because of the strategic nature of the
resource,” he said.  Potash Corp., the world’s largest producer of its namesake
crop nutrient, has advanced 29 percent in New York since Aug.
16, the last trading day before Potash made BHP’s proposal
public.  Potash Corp.  fell  95 cents to $144.86 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  BHP , the world’s largest
mining company, fell 8 pence to 2,022 pence in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
