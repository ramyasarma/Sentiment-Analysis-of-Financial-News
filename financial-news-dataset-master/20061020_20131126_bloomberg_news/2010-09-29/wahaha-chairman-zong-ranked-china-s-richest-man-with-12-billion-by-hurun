Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co.  Chairman
 Zong Qinghou  was named China’s richest man by the  Hurun Rich
List , overtaking last year’s  Wang Chuanfu  of  BYD Co ., with an
estimated $12 billion of personal wealth.  Sales at Wahaha, a food and beverage maker, surged 32
percent last year to 43.2 billion yuan ($6.5 billion), according
to the company’s website. BYD’s Wang, No. 1 on last year’s Hurun
list, saw his estimated wealth drop 10 percent, placing him 12th
on this year’s list with $4.6 billion.  Zong, 65, founded Wahaha, which means “laughing child” in
Chinese, in 1987. He built the company, formerly the sales
department in a school-run business in the eastern Chinese city
of Hangzhou, into a nationwide food and beverage maker with 30
billion yuan in assets and 30,000 employees, according to the
company’s website.  Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Co.  Chairman Li Li and his
family were ranked the second-richest with $6 billion of wealth,
followed by  Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Ltd. ’s Zhang Yin with 
$5.6 billion, according to the  Hurun  report’s website.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. ’s Liang Wen’gen and  Baidu Inc. ’s
 Robin Li  ranked fourth and fifth with $5.4 billion and $5.3
billion, respectively.  Danone Lawsuits  Zong and Wahaha were embroiled in more than 30 lawsuits in
at least seven countries against  Group Danone SA , the world’s
biggest yogurt maker. Danone sold its 51 percent stake in their
ventures on Sept. 30, 2009, after two years of legal disputes.  The sale of  Danone ’s stake in ventures with Wahaha ended an
almost 12-year collaboration that collapsed in 2007 amid
accusations that Zong unlawfully sold Wahaha-branded juice and
tea outside the partnership.  Zong, who started working after graduating from junior high
school, was among the Chinese billionaires invited by  Warren Buffett , chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , and  Microsoft
Corp.’s  chairman  Bill Gates  to a charity dinner yesterday in
Beijing. Zong didn’t make it to the event because of a
scheduling conflict, according to local media.  China has 875,000 millionaires, 6.1 percent more than last
year, according to the Shanghai-based Hurun Research Institute.  Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch & Co.  estimated  the number
of millionaires in the country last year surged 31 percent to
477,000.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
