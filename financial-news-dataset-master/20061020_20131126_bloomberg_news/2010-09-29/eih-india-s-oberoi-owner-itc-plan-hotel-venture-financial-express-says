ITC Ltd., India’s biggest cigarette
maker and a hotel operator, and EIH, which runs the Oberoi
Hotels and Resorts chain, have drawn up a plan to combine their
hotel operations, the Financial Express reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Once the plan is implemented, it would be a three-way
venture between the two companies and Reliance Industries Ltd.,
which recently bought a stake in EIH, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
