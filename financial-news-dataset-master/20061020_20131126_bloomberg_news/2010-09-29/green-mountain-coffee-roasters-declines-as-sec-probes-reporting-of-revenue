Green Mountain Coffee Roasters
Inc ., the seller of Keurig single-cup brewers, fell 16 percent
in Nasdaq trading after disclosing that regulators are
investigating how the company recognizes revenue.  The stock plunged $5.95 to $31.06 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The decline is the biggest in
eight years.  The Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement
division is also investigating the company’s relationship with
one of its vendors. The SEC informed Green Mountain about the
probe on Sept. 20, requesting documents and other information,
the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday after the
markets closed. Details of the investigation weren’t disclosed.
Green Mountain said it’s cooperating with the SEC.  Green Mountain also said it has discovered an “immaterial
accounting error” related to the inventory at its Keurig unit.
The mistake, which arose during fiscal year 2007, caused the
consolidated inventory to be exaggerated and the cost of sales
to be understated, the company said in the filing. The error was
found during preparation for the company’s fourth-quarter
 earnings  report, Green Mountain said.  As of June 26, 2010, there is a cumulative $7.6 million
overstatement of pretax income, according to the filing. Net of
tax, the cumulative error resulted in a $4.4 million
overstatement of net income or a $0.03 cumulative impact on
earnings per share, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
