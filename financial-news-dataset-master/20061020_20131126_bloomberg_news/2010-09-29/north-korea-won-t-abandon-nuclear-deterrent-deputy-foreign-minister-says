North Korea won’t give up its
nuclear weapons while U.S. aircraft carriers are deployed near
the Korean peninsula, the communist nation’s deputy foreign
minister told the  United Nations  General Assembly today.  “As long as U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers sail around the
seas of our country, our nuclear deterrent can never be
abandoned but should be strengthened further,” Vice Foreign
Minister Pak Kil Yon said. “This is the lesson we have drawn.”  North Korea detonated nuclear weapons in May 2009 and in
July 2006.  The Korean peninsula “would have already been turned into
a war field scores of times,” Pak said, “had it not been for
the powerful war deterrent built.”  “It is not surprising that we are hearing strident
statements during its high-level meeting,” State Department
spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said. “Our actions in the region
are geared towards peace and stability. If North Korea takes
action to de-nuclearize and build constructive relationships
with other countries, including the United States, it has
nothing to fear from the United States.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
