Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s biggest
bank, said Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  bought shares
valued at about 6.2 million euros ($8.4 million) in the
company’s rights offer.  Ackermann purchased 186,863 shares at 33 euros apiece “via
exercise of subscription rights,” the Frankfurt-based lender
said in a statement today.  Deutsche Bank said earlier this month that it will raise
about 10.2 billion euros in Europe’s biggest rights offer of
2010 to finance the takeover of Deutsche Postbank AG and help
the lender meet new regulatory requirements by the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
