Ryan Hall  withdrew from next
month’s  Chicago Marathon , citing “perpetual fatigue” for
dropping his planned run at the American record in the 26.2-mile
distance.  Hall, 27, the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials marathon winner,
said he didn’t want to race feeling less than his “very best,”
according to an e-mailed statement from marathon organizers.
Hall had said he wanted to break  Khalid Khannouchi ’s U.S. record
of 2 hours, 5 minutes, 38 seconds, set at the 2002 London
Marathon, in the Oct. 10 race.  “Perhaps I was a bit too eager to capitalize on the
lightning-fast course, atmosphere and history of the event in my
race preparations, causing me to over-train and suffer from
perpetual fatigue,” Hall said in the statement. “If I am not
fully ready to run, I owe it to myself, my fans and organizers
to not show up with less than my very best.”  Hall finished 14th at the Sept. 19 Philadelphia Half
Marathon, four minutes slower than his career-best time at the
13.1-mile distance. He was the top American finisher in this
year’s Boston Marathon, finishing fourth at 2:08:41, the fastest
by an American in the race’s history.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael Buteau  in Atlanta
