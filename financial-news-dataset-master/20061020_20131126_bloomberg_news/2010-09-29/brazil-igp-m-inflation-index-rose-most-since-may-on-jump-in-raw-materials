Brazil’s broadest measure of
inflation rose the fastest since May this month, cementing
expectations that the central bank will have to increase
interest rates in the first quarter of 2011.  Construction, consumer and wholesale prices, as measured by
the IGP-M index, rose 1.15 percent in September, in line with
the 1.12 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 27
analysts. The index rose 7.77 percent from the same period a
year ago, the Rio de Janeiro-based  Getulio Vargas Foundation 
said today in a  report  released on its website.  The number shows that the central bank may need to revise
its view that a slower global economic recovery will control
inflation without further interest rate increases, said  Pedro Tuesta , senior economist for Latin America at New York-based
4Cast Inc.  “Inflation is rebounding much more than the central bank
was saying,” Tuesta said in a telephone interview from
Washington. “It confirms the view that the central bank is too
dovish.”  The monthly increase was led by a 4.56 percent rise in
agricultural products, and a 4.08 percent rise in the cost of
raw materials. The price of industrial products rose 0.67
percent.  Wholesale prices, which have a 60 percent weighting in the
IGP-M index, increased 1.60 percent in September, while consumer
prices rose 0.34 percent, the report said.  The real strengthened 0.33 percent to 1.7023 per U.S.
dollar at 8Ç44 a.m. New York time. In the overnight interest-
rate futures market, the yield on the contract due in January
2012, the most traded today on Sao Paulo’s BM&F Exchange, was
unchanged at 11.59 percent.  The IGP-M will increase 9.20 percent in 2010, according to
the median forecast in a central bank survey of about 100
economists published September 27.  Consumer inflation  as measured by the benchmark IPCA-15
index accelerated to 4.57 percent in the year through mid-
September, the statistics agency said Sept. 21. The central bank
targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage
points.  Policy makers on Sept. 1 kept the benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 10.75 percent, after raising the Selic a total of
two percentage points over their three previous meetings to
prevent the economy from overheating.  Analysts forecast policy makers will resume rate increases
in March, lifting the Selic to 11.75 percent by June, according
to the median forecast in the central bank survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
