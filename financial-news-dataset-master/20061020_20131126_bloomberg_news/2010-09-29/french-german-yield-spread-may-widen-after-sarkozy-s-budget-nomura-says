French government bonds yields may
increase relative to benchmark German bunds because France’s
budget today will show the nation isn’t willing to extend
austerity measures, Nomura International Plc said.  “France’s reluctance to pursue deep spending cuts and
heavy tax rises could lead to spread widening in the medium
term,” a team of analysts led by  Nick Firoozye  in London wrote
in a research report today. The government’s plans are based on
a “rather optimistic 2 percent growth scenario,” they wrote.  The difference in yield, or  spread , between 10-year bonds
from the two nations was at 37 basis points as of 8:02 a.m. in
London. It widened to as much as 56 basis points in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
