Porsche SE , the maker of the 911
sports car, said full-year revenue rose 18 percent, buoyed by
deliveries of the new Panamera sedan.  Sales in the 12 months through July 31 increased to 7.79
billion euros ($10.6 billion), Stuttgart, Germany-based Porsche
said in a statement today. Deliveries climbed 8.8 percent to
81,850 cars and sport-utility vehicles from 75,238 last year.  “The record sales shows that Porsche has returned to its
old strength,” the carmaker said in the statement. “Porsche
will continue the positive trend in the current business year.”  Porsche, which is merging with  Volkswagen AG , Europe’s
largest automaker, is weighing new cars to expand its four-model
lineup and reach a target of doubling deliveries to 150,000
vehicles in the medium term. The Panamera has sold 20,615 units
worldwide since it was introduced by Porsche as the latest model
line last September.  The manufacturer is scheduled to publish full-year
financial results Oct. 19 and is planning to hold a
shareholders’ meeting Nov. 30 to approve a capital increase of
about 5 billion euros in the first half of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
