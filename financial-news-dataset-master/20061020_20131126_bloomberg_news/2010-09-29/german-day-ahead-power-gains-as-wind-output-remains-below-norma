German power for next-day delivery
advanced as forecasts showed wind availability in Europe’s
biggest market will remain below usual levels through Oct. 1.  Production from wind turbines will be above 2,500 megawatts
tomorrow, up from about 2,000 megawatts today,  Markedskraft
Deutschland GmbH  said in an e-mailed report. That compares with
an average for this time of year of 4,000 megawatts. Wind, a
less-predictable energy source than nuclear, coal or gas-fired
generation, produced 6.8 percent of Germany’s power last year.  Baseload day-ahead power  rose 1.7 percent to 57.25 euros
($77.94) a megawatt-hour on the  Epex Spot SE  exchange. The
contract last traded at 54.50 euros in the over-the-counter
market, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.
Baseload power is delivered around the clock.  Capacity has been further reduced since Germany’s third-
biggest utility, EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG, took its
1,395-megawatt Neckarwestheim 2 nuclear reactor offline at the
weekend for planned annual maintenance. E.ON AG, the country’s
biggest power company, halted its 878-megawatt Isar-1 reactor on
Sept. 11. It’s due to return to the grid on Oct. 19, according
to a company website tracking starts and stops.  Power for next-year delivery, a European benchmark, fell
0.4 percent to 49.86 euros a megawatt-hour as of 6:17 p.m.
Berlin time. It has traded in a range of 45.05 euros to 55.50
euros this year.  Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, also gets power from
nuclear, hard coal, lignite, natural gas and solar stations.  Bloomberg tracks prices from brokers including GFI Group
