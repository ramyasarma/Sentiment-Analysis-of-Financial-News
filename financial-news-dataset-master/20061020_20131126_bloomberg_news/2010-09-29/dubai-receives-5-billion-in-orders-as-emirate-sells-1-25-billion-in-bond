Dubai’s government said it recevied
orders of about $5 billion for its two-part bond sale.  The government raised $1.25 billion from a 5-year, $500-
million issue that was priced to yield 6.7 percent, according to
a statement by Dubai’s government. The $750-million 10-year note
was priced to yield 7.75 percent.  Dubai hired Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and
Standard Chartered Plc as joint lead managers for a dollar bond
offering, the government said.  “The government has taken prudent measures to control
costs and manage its budget deficit and this successful issuance
provides Dubai with additional liquidity for general budgetary
purposes,” Abdulrahman Al Saleh, director general of the
Department of Finance, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
