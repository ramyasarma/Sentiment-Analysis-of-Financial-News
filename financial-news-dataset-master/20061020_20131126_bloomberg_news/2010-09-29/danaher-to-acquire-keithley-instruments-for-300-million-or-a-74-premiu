Danaher Corp.  agreed to acquire
 Keithley Instruments Inc. , a maker of electronic instruments
used by researchers, for about $300 million.  Danaher will  buy  the outstanding common shares and Class B
common shares of Keithley for $21.60 each, a 74 percent premium
to yesterday’s closing price, the Washington-based company said
today in a statement. The price of $300 million is net of cash,
Danaher said.  Danaher plans to add Keithley, based in Cleveland, to its
Tektronix business. Keithley makes about 150  products  used to
measure signals and posted about $102.5 million in revenue in
the fiscal year ended September 2009.  Danaher fell 40 cents to $41.05 at 9:04 a.m. before the
start of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Keithley
jumped $9.13 to $21.52.  To contact the reporter on this story:
