The Australian dollar is set to
rally to the highest levels in at least two years against its
U.S. and Canadian counterparts after breaking channels of
resistance, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Aussie traded above a channel resistance, established
by a June low, versus the greenback, signaling it could further
rally to test a 2008 high of 98.50 U.S. cents,  Niall O’Connor , a
currency strategist with JPMorgan in New York, wrote in a note
to clients. The South Pacific nation’s currency surged through a
November high against the Canadian dollar and the pair is
trading close to parity.  “Aussie-U.S. dollar is pushing through the key June
channel resistance, which is consistent with the overall bearish
view for the U.S. dollar,” O’Connor wrote. “Note the action in
Aussie-Canadian dollar affirms the bullish Aussie bias.”  The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to 96.97 U.S. cents
as of 9:13 a.m. in New York. It earlier touched 97.30 U.S.
cents, the highest since July 2008. The Aussie fell 0.1 percent
to 99.56 Canadian cents after reaching 99.98 Canadian cents, the
strongest level since 2004.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A resistance level is an area on a
chart where analysts anticipate orders to sell a security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
