Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter 
will remain hospitalized in Cleveland for “additional
observation,” a spokeswoman for the hospital said.  “Former President Jimmy Carter is feeling normal this
morning,” spokeswoman Shannon Mortland said in an e-mailed
statement. Doctors MetroHealth Medical Center “recommended
additional observation during the day.”  Carter will resume his schedule “as soon as possible,”
Mortland said.  Carter, the 39th U.S. president who turns 86 tomorrow,
became ill yesterday from an upset stomach while on a flight to
Cleveland, spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said. He was held
overnight for observation at Metro Health Hospital in Cleveland
on his doctor’s recommendation.  Carter, a former peanut farmer and naval officer from
Plains, Georgia, was president from 1977 to 1981. His efforts to
promote peace and human rights earned him the Nobel Peace Prize
in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
