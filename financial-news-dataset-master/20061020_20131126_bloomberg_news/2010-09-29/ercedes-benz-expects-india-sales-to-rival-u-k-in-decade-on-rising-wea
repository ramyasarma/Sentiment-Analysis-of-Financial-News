Daimler AG , the world’s second-
largest luxury-car maker, expects Mercedes-Benz sales in India
to rival the U.K. within a decade as rising wealth stokes demand.  “India is growing very strongly,”  Wilfried Aulbur , the
head of the company’s local unit, said in a Sept. 27 telephone
interview. The country “should be up there with the U.K. or
other large European markets” in eight to 10 years, he said.  Daimler and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  have expanded in
India and China, the two fastest-growing major Asian economies,
as increasing disposable incomes boost demand for luxury goods.
Mercedes sales in China have surged 12-fold in a decade because
of a growing number of millionaires.  “Given that money is now easy, Indians want luxury cars
and they want them now,” said  Deepesh Rathore , India managing
director at IHS Automotive in New Delhi. Nationwide luxury-car
sales may surge to 65,000 vehicles in 2020 from an expected
13,000 this year, he said.  Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler’s sales in India jumped 84
percent in the first eight months of the year to 3,497 units,
Aulbur said. Mercedes-Benz sales in the U.K. rose 9.4 percent to
44,794 in the same period, according to the Society of Motor
Manufacturers & Traders in London.  In China, Mercedes sales more than doubled to at least
87,400 vehicles through August, according to a  statement  on the
carmaker’s website. Last year, the automaker’s car sales totaled
71,900 vehicles compared with 5,800 in 2000.  India Expansion  Nationwide car sales in India, the third-biggest Asian
economy, have risen for 19 consecutive months, reaching a record
in August.  Volkswagen AG , Ford Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.
are among automakers that have expanded factories and introduced
new models because of rising demand. Nationwide car sales may
reach 3 million by 2015, according to the government.  “As people make more money and as opinions and attitudes
change, they are much more prone to spending on luxury
vehicles,” Aulbur said. “This represents a tremendous
opportunity going forward.”  The number of millionaires in China and India may triple
between 2008 and 2018, according to the 2009 World Wealth Report
by Cap Gemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.  Luxury-car sales in China may increase at almost double the
industry pace of 20 percent to reach 530,000 vehicles this year
and 1.1 million by 2015, according to researcher J.D Power &
Associates.  Daimler said earlier this month that Aulbur had decided to
leave the company. Aulbur said he would continue to head the
Indian operations till the company finds a replacement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
