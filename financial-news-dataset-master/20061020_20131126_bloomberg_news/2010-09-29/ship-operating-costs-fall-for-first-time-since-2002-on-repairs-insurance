Ship operating costs fell for the
first time since 2002 as last year’s global recession cut
owners’ spending on repairs, insurance and naval stores,
consultant Moore Stephens LLP said in a report.  Running costs in 2009 declined 2 percent and for every
ship type except so-called reefers that transport refrigerated
cargo, Moore Stephens said yesterday in an e-mailed report. The
data were derived from 2,550 vessels. The only cost to increase
was crewing, which gained by the most since the first study was
published in 2000.  “The period covered by the report embraces the very peak
of the worldwide economic recession,” Moore Stephens partner
Richard Greiner said in the report. “The effects of that can
be seen in each of the cost categories.”  Container ships had the largest drop, declining as much as
8.9 percent to $7,473 a day. Costs for very large crude
carriers, or VLCCs, fell 1.5 percent to $10,645 while iron ore
carrying capesizes declined 2.7 percent to $7,312.  The amount owners had to spend on repairs and naval stores
fell for all vessel types, with container ships again having the
largest decline, according to the report. Naval stores includes
items such as food.  To contact the reporter on this story:
