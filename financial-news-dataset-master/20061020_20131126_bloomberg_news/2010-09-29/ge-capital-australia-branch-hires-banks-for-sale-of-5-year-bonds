General Electric Capital Australia
Funding Pty, a unit of  General Electric Co. ’s  financing arm, is
planning to issue Australian dollar-denominated bonds in its
first sale in the country in three years.  The Melbourne-based unit hired Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. and National Australia Bank Ltd. to help it
sell the notes, which will be benchmark in size, according to an
e-mailed statement from National Australia Bank. Benchmark
typically means at least A$500 million ($485 million).  The five-year  bonds  may yield about 175 basis points more
than the swap rate, according to a person familiar with the
matter, who asked not to be named as the details aren’t public.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  GE Capital Australia last issued a benchmark Australian
dollar-denominated bond in the country in March 2007. The A$500
million of floating-rate notes due November 2011 were priced to
yield 19 basis points above the bank bill swap rate, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The unit has A$3.9 billion in
 debt  maturing next year, the data show.  It last issued Australian dollar-denominated bonds in the
country in September 2007, selling A$200 million of floating-
rate notes, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
