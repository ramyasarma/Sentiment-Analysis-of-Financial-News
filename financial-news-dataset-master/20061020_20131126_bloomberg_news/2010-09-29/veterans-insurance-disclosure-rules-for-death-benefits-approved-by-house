The U.S. House passed legislation
that would set new disclosure rules for life-insurance companies
that provide death benefits to veterans.  Prudential Financial Inc. , which provides life insurance
for the military under a contract with the  Department of
Veterans Affairs , pays death benefits for fallen soldiers by
opening accounts that their families can draw against. The
insurer pays lower interest rates on these accounts than it
earns with the money and provides checkbook-like drafts which
aren’t guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
Bloomberg Markets reported on July 28.  The legislation would require insurers to tell
beneficiaries how the money will be invested and provide
additional financial counseling. Prudential and the VA maintain
that this has provided families a safe place for their money
while they decide what to do with it. The company and the agency
say they already are providing counseling.  “We need to put our survivors first and provide them
transparency and disclosure as quickly as possible,” said bill
sponsor Representative  Debbie Halvorson , an Illinois Democrat.  The House  voted  358-66 for the measure, which now goes to
the Senate. The bill is H.R. 5993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
