Ijaz Butt, chairman of the Pakistan
Cricket Board, withdrew his match-fixing allegations against
England players and said there had been a “misunderstanding”
over his comments, Agence France-Presse reported.  Last week English cricket officials wrote to Butt
threatening legal action unless he issued a “full and unreserved
apology” for the allegations.  Butt had said in a television interview there was “loud
and clear talk in bookie circles that some English players have
taken enormous amounts of money to lose” the third one-day
international at the Oval in London on Sept. 17.  ‘‘It is regrettable that there was a misunderstanding
arising from my comments,’’ AFP cited Butt as saying in a
statement today. ‘‘I never intended to question the behavior and
integrity of the England players nor the England and Wales
Cricket Board, nor to suggest that any of them were involved in
any corrupt practices or in a conspiracy against Pakistan
cricket.’’  He said he had never seen any evidence of wrongdoing by any
England player or the ECB at any time, and added he hoped ‘‘this
public withdrawal will draw a line under the matter.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
