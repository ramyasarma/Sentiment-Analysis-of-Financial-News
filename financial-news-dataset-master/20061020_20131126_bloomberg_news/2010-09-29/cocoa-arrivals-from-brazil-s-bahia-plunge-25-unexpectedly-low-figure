Cocoa arrivals from Bahia, Brazil’s
biggest growing region, advanced 26 percent in the latest week
even as they “still fell short of expectations,” analyst
 Thomas Hartmann  said.  Arrivals were 42,063 bags in the week ended Oct. 3,
according to an e-mailed report from the Salvador, Brazil-based
analyst dated yesterday. That compares with the 33,338 bags he
reported a week earlier. Total arrivals from Brazil gained to
56,253 bags from 52,268 bags. Bahia represents at least 70
percent of the country’s output, Hartmann said Sept. 2. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  “Although the final crosschecks and corrections of the
Temporao season that now has ended may introduce small changes,
it looks like the final outturn will effectively fall short of
the originally forecast 1.3 million bags,” said Hartmann.  Prospects for the main crop are “very bright and most
observers look at figures in the 850,000-1,000,000 bags range,”
the analyst added. Hartmann is a board member of the Commercial
Association of Bahia in charge of the group’s statistical
service on Brazilian cocoa output, according to the Sept. 2 e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
