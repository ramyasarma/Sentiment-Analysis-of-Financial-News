France aims to keep the premium it
pays to borrow over Germany at the “low end” of its recent
range, Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said today.  France currently pays about 38 basis points more than
Germany to borrow for 10 years, down from 56 basis points in
June 8.  The finance ministry is “really quite confident” that
France will achieve 2 percent growth in gross domestic product
next year, Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris. The
government will “do what it takes” to reduce the deficit to 6
percent of GDP next year, she said. She also said that France’s
indebtedness will begin dropping in 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
