Tullow Oil Plc , the London-based
developer of African oil fields, may invest more than the 990
million pounds ($1.6 billion) it forecast to spend this year as
it increases production in Ghana and Uganda.  “Probably that will be a little bit more the way things
are going this year,” Paul Burden, principal geoscientist, said
at the Africa Energy Week conference in Cape Town today. About
85 percent of  Tullow ’s global spending will be in Africa where
petroleum finds have exceeded expectations, he said.  Tullow has 93 licenses globally and is active in 15 African
countries. It produces nearly 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day and expects to increase that to more than 100,000 barrels a
day from the middle of next year when its Jubilee project in
Ghana starts. Tullow’s current African production accounts for
38,500 barrels a day of the total.  In Uganda, where Tullow is developing oil and gas fields,
tax disputes with the government relating to Tullow’s $1.5
billion  purchase  of Heritage Oil Plc’s stakes in two blocks this
year “do not affect the planned partnership with Total” and
China National Offshore Oil Corp., Burden said, adding the deal
has “basically been approved” by the government.  Tullow warned last month that the disagreement over tax
payments may delay projects in the country where it plans to
develop the Lake Albert fields with Total SA and China National.  The dispute is “between the government and Tullow now that
Heritage has exited,” Burden said. About $128 has already been
paid, and negotiations over the remaining $281 million are
continuing, he said.  Ugandan Finance Minister Syda Bbumba said last week the
government expects to resolve the dispute soon.  Tullow expects the Lake Albert partnership to start
commercial gas output from the Nzizi field and first commercial
oil production from the Kasamene field in the fourth quarter of
2011. It could produce more than 200,000 barrels a day oil
equivalent in Uganda in 2014 or 2015, Burden said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
