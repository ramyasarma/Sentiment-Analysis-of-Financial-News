China Petrochemical Corp. has
stopped exploration at the Sakhalin-3 project in Russia, the
21st Century Business Herald said, without citing anyone.  The state-owned company known as Sinopec Group has recalled
all of its technical crew from the field off Sakhalin Island
because exploration results haven’t been “ideal,” the
newspaper  reported  yesterday.  Huang Wensheng , the Beijing-based
spokesman for the group, couldn’t be immediately reached on his
office and mobile phone for comment.  The group’s listed unit  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. 
and OAO Rosneft signed an agreement in 2007 to develop natural-
gas and oil deposits at the Veninsky sector off Sakhalin Island
in Russia’s Far East. Rosneft holds 74.9 percent of the venture
and the Chinese company owns the rest.  China Petroleum, known as Sinopec, agreed to fund 75
percent of the exploration costs, Rosneft said in 2007.
Exploration may cost $300 million, according to Sinopec in 2006.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Ryan Woo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
