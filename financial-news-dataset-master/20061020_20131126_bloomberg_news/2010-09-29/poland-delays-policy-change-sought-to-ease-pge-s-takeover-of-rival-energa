Poland’s government for the second
time delayed approving a policy change intended to speed up a
deal accounting for 30 percent of planned asset-sale revenue
this year.  The cabinet didn’t decide yesterday on an amendment to
energy policy that would help  Polska Grupa Energetyczna SA , the
country’s largest power utility, buy Energa SA for 7.5 billion
zloty ($2.6 billion). The meeting will continue today.  A disagreement among ministers had blocked the change a
week earlier, Deputy Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak  said. The
sale is also opposed by the antitrust regulator, who says it
would limit competition.  The Treasury Ministry on Sept. 15 chose PGE, also state-
controlled, to buy Energa, the fourth-largest power utility, as
it seeks to sell 25 billion zloty of assets this year to help
finance the budget deficit. The change in energy policy will
show how the transaction may help PGE develop Poland’s first
nuclear power plant, increasing energy security and reducing
pollution.  “At last week’s meeting there were differences of opinion,
including among ministers from the Civic Platform,” Pawlak said
in an interview on Sept. 27, referring to the senior coalition
partner. Pawlak, head of the smaller Peasants Party, had
presided over that meeting in Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s
absence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
