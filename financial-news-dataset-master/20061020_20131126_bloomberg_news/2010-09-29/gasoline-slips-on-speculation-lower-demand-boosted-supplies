Gasoline surged to a seven-week
high after the Energy Department reported that demand increased
last week and supplies slid to a nine-week low.  Futures rose the most in eight weeks as demand jumped 6.1
percent from a week earlier.  Gasoline stockpiles  fell 3.47
million barrels to 222.6 million, the lowest level since July
23. It was the largest drop since October 2009. An gain of
350,000 barrels was projected in a Bloomberg News survey.  “There’s no doubt this weekly report is bullish,” said
 David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
LLC in Houston. “You had draws across the board. Refinery
utilization is down. And the magnitude of the gasoline draw and
the nice uptick in the  demand  are the biggest positives.”  Gasoline for October delivery rose 4.76 cents, or 2.4
percent, to settle at $1.9955 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. It was the largest jump since Aug. 2 and
the highest close for the front-month contract since Aug. 11.  The higher-demand summer driving season traditionally ends
after the U.S. Labor Day holiday, which this year occurred on
Sept. 6. Stockpiles in the week ended Sept. 24 were 5.3 percent
above a year earlier and 13 percent above the five-year average,
according to the department.  “The size of the draw today is a little bullish,” said
 Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield, Massachusetts. “You still have a lot of supply out
there.”  U.S. refiners reduced operating  rates  2 percentage points
to 85.8 percent last week, the lowest level since April 9.  Demand , as measured by what refiners and blenders supply to
wholesalers, rose to an average 9.38 million barrels a day.  Retail Demand  U.S. retail gasoline consumption fell for the fifth time in
six weeks as fuel use declined everywhere except on the East
Coast, MasterCard Inc. said yesterday. Motorists bought an
average 8.98 million barrels of fuel a day in the week ended
Sept. 24, down 0.2 percent from the prior week.  The premium of gasoline over crude oil, or the crack
spread, based on November contracts, widened about 25 cents to
$5.42 a barrel.  Supplies of  distillates , including heating oil and diesel,
fell 1.27 million barrels to 173.6 million barrels, the lowest
level in seven weeks. A rise of 325,000 barrels was projected in
the survey. Inventories are 22 percent above the five-year
average for the period, according to department data.  Demand  for distillates rose 5.7 percent to an average of
3.9 million barrels a day.  Heating oil for October delivery added 6.6 cents, or 3.1
percent, to settle at $2.1905 a gallon, the highest close since
Aug. 4 and biggest jump in almost two months. The heating oil
crack spread, based on November contracts, gained about 96 cents
to $15.01 a barrel.  Regular gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.1
cent to $2.692 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
