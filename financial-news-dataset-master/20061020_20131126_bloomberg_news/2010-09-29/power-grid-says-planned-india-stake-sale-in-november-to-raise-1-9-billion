Power Grid Corp. of India , the
nation’s biggest transmission company, said the proposed sale of
a 20 percent stake as part of a record divestment of state-owned
assets may raise 86 billion rupees ($1.9 billion).  The government and the company each plan to sell 10 percent
in the state-run company between Nov. 8 and 12, Chairman  S.K. Chaturvedi  said by telephone from New Delhi today.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government wants to raise
400 billion rupees ($8.6 billion) from asset sales in the year
ending March 31 to help fund the construction of roads, ports
and hospitals. Power Grid needs funds to expand its transmission
network as utilities add generation capacity to reduce blackouts
in the world’s second-most populous nation.  The government and the company plan to sell a combined
841.8 million shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Power Grid  shares  rose 1.6 percent to 108.60 rupees at 3:11
p.m. in Mumbai trading today, giving the company a  market value 
of $10.2 billion.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., ICICI Securities Ltd., JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and SBI Capital Markets have been appointed advisers
for the share sale, Chaturvedi said.  The government said in January it can sell shares in as
many as 68 companies as it seeks to shrink its budget deficit to
5.5 percent of gross domestic product this fiscal year from an
estimated 6.9 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
