Chile’s peso rose for a seventh
day, the longest winning streak in 21 months, as investors
increased bets against the dollar and traders priced in future
interest-rate rises.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 484.91 per U.S. dollar at
10:59 a.m. New York time, from 485.64 yesterday. The currency
strengthened for eight days during the period ended Dec. 18,
2008.  The peso has gained 13 percent in the third quarter, more
than any other major Latin American currency tracked by
Bloomberg, as the central bank raised its policy rate a half
percentage point to 2.5 percent on Sept. 16.  Data compiled by the central bank showed Chilean investors
increased bets on the peso, said  Maria Jesus Bofill , an
economist at Banco de Credito e Inversiones in Santiago.  “The figures show that pension funds are selling the
dollar forwards, pushing the dollar down,” Bofill said. “Local
activity figures are still flying, reaffirming expectations of
further policy rate increases. The question is whether that’s
already priced at around 490 per dollar.”  Foreign traders had net long positions in Chile peso
forwards of $161.9 million on Sept. 27, according to  data 
compiled by the central bank. Foreign traders went long the peso
in the forwards market on Sept. 24 for the first time since the
central bank started publishing daily data in October 2008. That
reflects Chilean funds selling dollars in the forwards market,
Bofill said.  Foreign traders have increased positions from a net short
of $6.6 billion at the start of this year, central bank  data 
show.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
