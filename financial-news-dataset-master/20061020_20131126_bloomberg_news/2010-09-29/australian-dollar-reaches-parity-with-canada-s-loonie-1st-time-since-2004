Australia’s dollar reached parity
with its Canadian counterpart for the first time in six years,
buoyed by growth prospects in China, and gained versus the U.S.
dollar. New Zealand’s currency fell as its trade deficit grew.  The Australian currency came within 2 U.S. cents of a
record high and was poised for a 9 percent gain for the month,
its biggest increase since May 2009. Data showed manufacturing
in China, Australia’s largest trading partner, accelerated in
September. The Canadian dollar has weakened as speculation
increased that its economy was softening and that recovery in
the U.S., its biggest trading partner, was faltering.  “Although both are commodity currencies, it’s their export
markets that are looking significantly different,” said  Matthew Strauss , senior currency strategist in Toronto at Royal Bank of
Canada. “The big difference is Canada’s exposure to the U.S.,
whereas as Australia is much more exposed to developments out of
Asia and Asia is looking much more robust compared to the U.S.”  Australia’s dollar, called the Aussie, strengthened as much
as 0.6 percent to C$1.0020 before trading at 1.0016 at 1:26 p.m.
in New York, up 0.5 percent. The currencies last traded on a
one-for-one basis in May 2004.  The Aussie reached 97.30 U.S. cents, the most since July
2008, the month it reached a record high of 98.50 cents, before
trading at 97.08 cents. It closed yesterday at 96.76 U.S. cents.
The Aussie has strengthened 8 percent this month and 15 percent
since June 30. It traded at 81.16 yen, compared with 81.15 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, declined 0.2
percent to 73.79 U.S. cents, from 73.94 cents. It was set for a
7.7 percent advance for the third quarter and a 5.5 percent gain
for September. It fell 0.6 percent to 61.66 yen.  Deficit Widens  The kiwi weakened after the nation’s trade  deficit  widened
in August as exports fell to a nine-month low. The shortfall was
NZ$437 million ($323 million) from a revised NZ$183 million in
July, Statistics New Zealand said today. Exports fell 12 percent
from July to NZ$3.15 billion.  Chinese manufacturing accelerated for a second month in
September, according to a purchasing managers index published
today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. The business
gauge rose to 52.9, the highest level in five months.  Growth in U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter
slowed to an annual rate of 1.6 percent, from 3.7 percent in the
first quarter, according to government data.  Canada’s economy shrank by 0.1 percent in July, the first
decrease in 11 months, according to the median of 22 forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg News. Statistics Canada is due to release
the report tomorrow in Ottawa.  To contact the reporters on this story:
