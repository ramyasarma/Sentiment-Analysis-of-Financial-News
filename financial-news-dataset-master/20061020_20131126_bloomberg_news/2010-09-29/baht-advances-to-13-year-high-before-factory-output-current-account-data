Thailand’s baht advanced to the
strongest level in 13 years and bonds rose as global funds added
to holdings of the nation’s assets before reports this week show
factory output grew and the current account swung to a surplus.  Manufacturing production increased for a 12th straight
month in August and the current account had a surplus of $600
million, compared with a deficit of $1.1 billion in July,
according to economists in separate Bloomberg surveys. The
currency has gained 6.2 percent this quarter, Asia’s best
performance, as exchange data show overseas investors bought
$1.69 billion more Thai equities than they sold during the
period.  “Investors keep pouring money into countries such as
Thailand with solid economic growth, putting appreciation
pressure on the baht,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist
at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “A current-account surplus
will mean a gain in the value of its currency is inevitable.”  The baht climbed 0.2 percent to 30.50 per dollar as of 8:48
a.m. in Bangkok and touched 30.49, the strongest level since
July 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
may appreciate to around 30 by the end of this year, Hayashi
said.  The Bank of Thailand will say tomorrow factory output
increased 20.8 percent in August from a year earlier after
having gained 16.3 percent in July, according to the median
forecast of 11 analysts in the Bloomberg survey.  The Southeast Asian nation’s  current account  has been in
surplus every month except twice since December 2008, according
to central bank data.  The yield on the government’s five-year bond fell to the
 lowest  level since May 2009 after the  Thai Bond Market
Association  said global funds yesterday poured a net $230
million into the nation’s bonds, the most since Sept. 8. The
rate on the 3.625 percent debt maturing in May 2015 dropped nine
basis points to 2.549 percent, according to Bloomberg data.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, was unchanged at 1.535
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
