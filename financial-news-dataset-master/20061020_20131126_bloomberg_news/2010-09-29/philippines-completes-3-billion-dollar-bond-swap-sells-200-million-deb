The Philippines sold $200 million
of dollar bonds due January 2021 and completed a dollar bond
exchange by issuing almost $3 billion of notes to extend debt
maturity as policy makers tackle a record budget deficit.  The government said it will issue $2.04 billion of the new
2021 bonds and $950 million of additional 6.375 percent notes
due October 2034 in the nation’s first dollar bond exchange
program in four years. The new 10-year bonds with a coupon of 4
percent were priced at 99.248 to yield 4.091 percent while the
2034 bonds were offered at 114.879 to yield 5.276 percent, the
government said in a statement received via e-mail.  President  Benigno Aquino , who took office on June 30, is
seeking to fix the nation’s finances in part by tapping new
sources of funds and stretching the average maturity of
outstanding debt. The budget had been in  deficit  for 21 of the
last 25 years and the shortfall is projected to widen to 325
billion pesos ($7.4 billion) in 2010, from 298.5 billion pesos
last year.  The exchange lengthens the average maturity of Philippines’
foreign-currency borrowing by almost a year and will reduce
annual interest costs by $58 million,  Krishna Hegde , Asia credit
strategist at Barclays Capital in Singapore said by phone today.  “This is another milestone in our strategy to extend
duration and proactively take advantage of the prevailing
constructive market environment to realize savings,” Treasurer
 Roberto Tan  said in the government’s statement.  Demand for the 2021 bonds was almost 10 times the $200
million offered, while $4.45 billion of debt was submitted for
exchange, the government said. The swap was offered to investors
holding $17.7 billion of dollar bonds maturing between February
2011 and January 2031.  ‘No Urgency’  The Philippine in September 2006 issued $1 billion of new
bonds maturing in 2024 and 2031 in exchange for notes maturing
in 2007 and 2025. In February 2004, it swapped $1.18 billion of
securities due in two to five years for new seven-year bonds.  The Philippines has $22.7 billion of dollar debt maturing
from 2011 to 2034, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
About $2.5 billion falls due in 2019, the most in any single
year. Citigroup Inc.,  HSBC  Holdings Plc and UBS AG managed the
latest bond sale and debt exchange.  Sales to Drop  Barclays expects the Philippines to cut dollar bond sales
to $750 million to $1 billion in 2011, Hegde said. That compares
with sales totaling $1.7 billion this year.  “They are definitely done for the year in overseas
borrowing and there’s no urgency for them to come to the market
right away in 2011,” he said. “They can be very
opportunistic.”  Dollar bond sales next year may drop as the amount of
overseas debt maturing falls by $215 million and the government
opts to sell more peso-denominated notes to global investors,
Barclays Capital said in a research note today.  The government on Sept. 10 raised $1 billion from its first
sale of peso bonds to global investors, attracting $13.3 billion
of orders. A debt swap involving local-currency bonds may happen
as early as this year, Finance Secretary  Cesar Purisima  said in
New York last week.  “The trend in emerging markets is to get longer duration
and the Philippines is playing its cards well,” said  Patrick Bengzon , who helps manage $11.8 billion at  Jyske Bank A/S  in
Silkeborg, Denmark. “It’s been a while since an emerging market
did something similar,” except for Peru, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
