Council of Europe Development Bank
raised A$300 million ($291 million) from Kangaroo bonds due in
October 2020 as sales of the securities head for a record year.  The 6 percent notes were priced to yield 6.095 percent, or
1.04 percentage point more than similar-maturity government
debt, according to an e-mailed statement from RBC Capital
Markets, which helped manage the transaction with Commonwealth
Bank of Australia and UBS AG.  Companies and supranational agencies have sold A$31 billion
of Kangaroo bonds in Australia this year, and are on track to
top the record A$32.4 billion raised in 2006, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Council of Europe’s Australian dollar
bonds are the Paris-based lender’s first Kangaroo notes since
April, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
