New York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo’s office said in an e-mailed statement that it hasn’t
reached an agreement with former state Comptroller Alan Hevesi,
who it said remains under investigation.  The New York Times reported today that Hevesi is “poised
to plead guilty” to a felony corruption charge related to his
office awarding pension investment business to people who
provided him and his aides with financial benefits.  Bradley Simon, a lawyer who represents Hevesi, didn’t
immediately return calls seeking comment after regular business
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
