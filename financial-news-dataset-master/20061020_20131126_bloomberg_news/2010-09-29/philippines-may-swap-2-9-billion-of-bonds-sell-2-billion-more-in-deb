The Philippines said it expects to
exchange about $2.9 billion of bonds with longer maturity notes
to extend its repayment schedule, according to a statement
released by the Department of Finance.  It may issue $2 billion of dollar-denominated debt maturing
in January 2021 and $900 million of existing October 2034 bonds
to bondholders in a  debt -swap program, the government said. The
government also intends to raise as much as $200 million by
selling 2021 notes to investors.  The government announced the exchange on Sept. 20 to
investors holding $17.7 billion of its dollar bonds maturing
between February 2011 and January 2031. The offer closed
yesterday and final terms of the exchange will be decided at 11
a.m. New York time today. It last conducted similar swap in
September 2006 and February 2004.  “The exchange should be a success as it gives investors
the opportunity to get into longer end of curve without
upsetting the market,” said  Patrick Bengzon , who helps manage
$11.8 billion at  Jyske Bank A/S  in Silkeborg, Denmark. “The
trend in emerging markets is to get longer duration and
Philippines is playing its cards well.”  President  Benigno Aquino , who took office on June 30, is
seeking to fix the nation’s finances in part by tapping new
sources of funds and stretching the average maturity of its
debt. Its budget has been in deficit for 21 of the last 25 years
and the shortfall is projected to widen to a record 325 billion
pesos ($7.4 billion) in 2010 from 298.5 billion pesos last year.  The Philippines has $22.47 billion of dollar debt maturing
between 2011 and 2034, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
About $2.5 billion falls due in 2019, the most in any single
year. Citigroup Inc.,  HSBC  Holdings Plc and UBS AG are managing
the debt swap.  The finance ministry yesterday indicated it will pay a
spread of at least 155 basis points, or 1.55 percentage points,
more than the equivalent interest-rate swaps on the 2021
securities. It also will pay a difference of at least 160 basis
points over the 4.375 percent U.S. government debt due May 2040
for investors who opt for the notes due October 2034.  To contact the reporter on this story:
