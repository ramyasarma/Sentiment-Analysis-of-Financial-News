India’s rupee rose to its strongest
level in more than four months as overseas investors pumped
record funds into local shares this year to benefit from the
nation’s relatively fast  economic growth .  The currency has gained 4.9 percent in September, the
biggest monthly advance since May 2009. Foreigners have invested
a net 834.7 billion rupees ($18.6 billion) in Indian stocks in
2010, according to data released yesterday by the  Securities and
Exchange Board of India . The rupee also gained as an  index  that
measures the dollar’s strength fell to a seven-month low,
signaling weaker demand for the greenback.  “The rupee is sustaining its positive bias as fund inflows
remain strong and the dollar has taken a beating,” said  Naveen Raghuvanshi , a currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd.
in Mumbai. “Further gains may depend on the central bank’s
comfort with the possible impact of the rupee rally on
exports.”  The Indian currency climbed 0.7 percent to 44.865 per
dollar, the highest level since May 10, as of 9:58 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee may
reach 44.75 this week, Raghuvanshi said.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.46 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.79
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  India’s gross domestic product expanded 8.8 percent in the
last quarter from a year earlier, outpacing growth of 3 percent
in the U.S., 1.9 percent in the 16-nation euro region and 2.4
percent in Japan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
