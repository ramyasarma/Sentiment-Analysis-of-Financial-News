Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Alcatel-Lucent SA  (ALU FP), France’s largest
telecommunications equipment maker, lost 2.3 percent to 2.47
euros. Nomura Holdings Inc. reiterated its “reduce” rating,
saying in a note that the stock has been “supported by upbeat
comments from management and has outperformed the sector by
about 15 percent this month, despite no tangible upgrades to
expectations.”  Alten SA  (ATE FP) gained 1.7 percent to 23 euros, erasing
yesterday’s decline. The company confirmed its target for full-
year like-for-like sales growth of above 5 percent as first-half
profit jumped.  Net income in the first six months was 25.2 million euros
($34.2 million) compared with 0.2 million euros a year earlier,
the technology consulting company said.  BNP Paribas SA  (BNP FP) and  Societe Generale SA  (GLE FP),
France’s biggest banks, lost 2.4 percent to 53.11 euros and 3.4
percent to 43.23 euros, respectively, as banking shares were the
worst performers in Europe today.  Eurazeo SA  (RF FP) rose 1.1 percent to 49.35 euros, a

income fell to 70.9 million euros from 74.8 million euros a year

euros, extending yeterday’s 2.4 percent loss. Peugeot “hosted
unexciting management presentations yesterday on the side of the
Paris motor-show,” BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research said in a
note. “Nothing to support the shares’ 20 percent run into the
event over the last month, in our view.” The brokerage kept an
“underperform” rating, while lifting its price estimate to 22
euros from 21 euros.  Rougier SA  (RGR FP) advanced 1.1 percent to 31.85 euros, a
