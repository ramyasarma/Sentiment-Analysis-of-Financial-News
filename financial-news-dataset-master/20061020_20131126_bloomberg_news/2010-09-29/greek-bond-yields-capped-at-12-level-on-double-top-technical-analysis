Greece’s 10-year bond  yields  may be
capped at about 12 percent after completing a double-top
pattern, Barclays Capital Japan Ltd. said, citing trading
patterns.  The yields jumped to a record 12.465 percent on May 7 as
the region’s debt crisis deepened, before falling to 6.302
percent on May 10 after European Union leaders crafted a bailout
for indebted nations. Benchmark rates climbed back to 11.816
percent on Sept. 7, forming a double-top pattern that signals a
reversal of trend, said  Yoshio Takahashi , a Tokyo-based chief
non-yen bond strategist at Barclays.  “Greece isn’t issuing new bonds and mostly relies on an
aid from the European Union for funds,” Takahashi said. “As
the bond market is being supported by public authorities,
further yield gains will be limited.”  The EU and the International Monetary Fund unveiled a
rescue package of almost $1 trillion on May 10, while the
European Central Bank said it will buy government and private
bonds as part of a bid to stave off a debt crisis.  In the near term, Greece’s yields will likely remain at the
current level, which was at 10.807 percent at the close of
trading yesterday, Takahashi said.  “There’s no reason why Greece’s long-term yields will
fall, since the market is now concerned about the spread of the
fiscal crisis to Ireland and Portugal,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
