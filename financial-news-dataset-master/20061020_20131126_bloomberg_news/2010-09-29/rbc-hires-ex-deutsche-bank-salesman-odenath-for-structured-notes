Royal Bank of Canada hired  David Odenath , a former Deutsche Bank AG salesman, for its U.S.
structured products group.  Odenath, 26, is responsible for selling equity- and
interest-rate-linked products to private banks and will be based
in New York, according to Kait Conetta, a bank spokeswoman. He
reports to  Donald Dye , U.S. head of sales of structured products
for individual investors.  At Deutsche Bank, Odenath worked in the asset management
division and focused on sales to private banks, which serve
firms’ wealthiest clients, Conetta said in an e-mail today.  Dye, a managing director based in New York, joined RBC in
April, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
 records . He previously worked for Morgan Stanley.  Structured products are securities created by banks, who
bundle debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
