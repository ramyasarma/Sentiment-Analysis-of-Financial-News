U.K. stocks declined, erasing
earlier gains, as shares of Vedanta Resources Plc dropped.  The FTSE 100 Index fell 0.4 percent to 5,558.09 at 9:15
a.m. in London. The gauge earlier rose as much as 0.8 percent.  Vedanta dropped 5 percent to 2,148 pence after a court

only smelter for breaching environment standards.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
