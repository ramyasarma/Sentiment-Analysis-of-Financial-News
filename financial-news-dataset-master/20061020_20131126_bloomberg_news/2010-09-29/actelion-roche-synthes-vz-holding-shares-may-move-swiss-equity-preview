Swiss stocks retreated for a third
day, led by basic-materials and financial companies, as the
nation’s leading economic indicators declined.  Syngenta AG , the world’s largest maker of agricultural
chemicals, fell 2.2 percent, while  Julius Baer Group Ltd. , the
120-year-old Swiss private bank, slid 2.9 percent and UBS AG
decreased 2.4 percent.  The benchmark Swiss Market Index declined 0.4 percent to
6,311.57 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich. Even so, the gauge
has risen 6.2 percent since this year’s low on July 5 as concern
abated that efforts by European governments to cut spending may
tip their economies into recession. The broader Swiss
Performance Index declined 0.3 percent today.  Switzerland’s leading economic indicators declined in
September, adding to signs the country’s economic recovery may
lose steam. The monthly gauge that aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead slipped to 2.21 from a revised
2.22 in August, the KOF research institute in Zurich said today.  “This is another precursor of the slowdown we are
expecting for the second half and for 2011,” said  Claude Maurer , an economist at Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG.  Syngenta  fell 2.2 percent to 248.2 Swiss francs, the
largest decrease in more than a week. Julius Baer dropped 2.9
percent to 36.7 francs, a third straight decline.  UBS AG ,
Switzerland’s biggest bank, slipped 2.4 percent to 17.06 francs,
its second fall in three days on continued concern over Europe’s
debt crisis.  Adecco SA, the world’s largest supplier of temporary
workers, jumped 2.7 percent to 51.25 francs.  Cie. Financiere
Richemont SA , Switzerland’s biggest jewelry maker, increased 2.1
percent to 46.78 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
