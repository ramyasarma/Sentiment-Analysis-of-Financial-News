Brazil’s  budget deficit  in August
narrowed to its lowest level since April, putting the country’s
ratio of debt to gross domestic product on a “very benign
trajectory,” the central bank said today.  The deficit shrank to 10.5 billion reais ($6.2 billion)
last month, compared with a 14.3 billion-real gap in July, the
 central bank  said today. The figure was lower than the median
forecast of an 11.4 billion-real deficit by four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Today’s budget report is likely to support policy makers’
wait-and-see approach of holding the central bank’s benchmark
interest rate at 10.75 percent until Brazil’s new government
assumes office next year, said  Leonardo Sapienza , chief
economist for Banco Votorantim SA in Sao Paulo.  “The central bank is waiting to see how the next
government will control spending at the beginning of next
year,” Sapienza said, speaking by phone from Sao Paulo.  Brazilians vote in presidential elections on Oct. 3, and
President  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva’s successor will be sworn in
on Jan. 1.  The primary budget surplus, or the surplus before interest
payments, rose to 5.22 billion reais from 2.45 billion reais the
previous month. The figure was lower than a median estimate of a
6 billion-real surplus in survey of 16 analysts conducted by
Bloomberg.  Net debt was 41.4 percent of gross domestic product, equal
to a revised 41.4 percent in July. The ratio may fall to
39.6 percent to 40 percent by year-end, the head of the central
bank’s economic department,  Altamir Lopes , told reporters in
Brasilia today.  September Record  Brazil’s central government will post a record primary
surplus in September after the government increased its stake in
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled oil company, to
48 percent from 40 percent last week, Treasury Secretary  Arno Augustin  said yesterday.  Brazil’s central government posted a budget surplus
excluding interest payments of 4.0 billion reais in August, the
highest result since April, the Treasury said yesterday.  Policy makers meeting Aug. 31-Sept. 1 kept the overnight
rate unchanged after raising it for three consecutive meetings
to 10.75 percent from a record 8.75 percent low in March.  The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.7042 per U.S. dollar at
11:57 a.m. New York time, from 1.7079 on Sept. 28. In the
overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on the
contract due in January 2012 fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 11.54 percent.  Latin America’s largest economy may expand this year at
 7.53 percent , its fastest pace in a quarter of century, a
central bank survey of economists released this week showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
