Transnet Ltd., South Africa’s
state-owned ports and freight-rail operator, is undertaking a
study to raise iron-ore capacity at the Saldanha port to 80
million metric tons a year, senior project manager David
Stromberg said.  The company is also studying the construction of a
manganese terminal with capacity of 12 million tons a year,
Stromberg said in a speech in Johannesurg today. The outcome of
the study is expected in December, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
