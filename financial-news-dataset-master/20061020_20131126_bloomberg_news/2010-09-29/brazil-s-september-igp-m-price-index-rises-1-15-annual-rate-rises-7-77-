Brazil’s monthly inflation as
measured by the IPG-M price index accelerated to 1.15 percent in
September, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said.  The increase was higher than the median 1.12 percent
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 27 analysts.  The IGP-M, the country’s broadest measure of inflation,
rose 7.77 percent from the same period a year ago, the Rio de
Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation said today in a report
released on its web site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
