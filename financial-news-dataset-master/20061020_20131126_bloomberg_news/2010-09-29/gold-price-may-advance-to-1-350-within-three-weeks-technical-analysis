Gold may rise to about $1,350 an
ounce in three weeks after prices resumed gains to a record,
according to technical analysis by Commerzbank AG.  The attached chart shows gold heading for $1,347.43
an ounce, a 261.8 percent Fibonacci extension of the February to
March advance,  Axel Rudolph , a technical strategist at
Commerzbank in London, said. He referred to one of the levels
used in so-called Fibonacci analysis. The price dropped 0.1
percent on Sept. 27, the first decline in a week, and has since
climbed to a record.  “The correction was far shorter than I had anticipated,”
Rudolph said yesterday. “We now target the Fibonacci extension
at the $1,350 area.” As long as the price stays above this
week’s low of $1,283.15 an ounce, gold prices will advance, he
said.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed to an all-time high of
$1,313.45 an ounce yesterday and is headed for a 10th annual
gain as investors seek protection against financial turmoil in
Europe and the prospect of slowing economic growth. It traded at
$1,309.45 an ounce at 6:03 p.m. in London yesterda.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on the story:
