Estonia’s  economy  will grow faster
than previously forecast this year and next as export demand
improves, the central bank said.  Gross domestic product will expand 2.5 percent this year
and 4.2 percent in 2011, the Tallinn-based  Eesti Pank  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That compares with the bank’s April
growth forecast of 1 percent and 4 percent, respectively.  The Baltic nation, which suffered the second-deepest
recession in the European Union during the financial crisis,
returned to annual growth in the second quarter as demand for
its electronics and machinery increased in the Nordic region.  “Economic growth of the main trading partners was faster
than expected in the first half of 2010, helping the Estonian
economy to recover,” the central bank said. “The fast growth
of trading partners will probably slow as the impact from the
upturn in global trade and government-sector spending increases
that supported it will start to wane.”  The central bank outlook exceeds Finance Ministry estimates
released last month that forecast economic growth of 2 percent
this year and 3.6 percent in 2011.  Estonia will have average annual inflation of 2.4 percent
this year and 2.7 percent in 2011, the central bank said. In
April, it forecast consumer-price growth of 1.3 percent this
year and 1.1 percent in 2011.  “There is a threat the present price and wage levels will
not sufficiently support new investment and job creation,” the
bank said. Still, the increase in inflation in coming months due
to rising food prices will probably remain temporary, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
