Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
and  Barclays Plc  received a complaint from the  U.K. Office of
Fair Trading  related to an investigation into disclosure of
confidential loan-pricing information.  The statement of objections was a procedural step, the OFT
said in a statement today. Edinburgh-based RBS agreed in March
to pay a 28.6 million pound ($45.3 million) fine after two
employees disclosed commercially sensitive data to counterparts
at Barclays from October 2007 to at least February 2008.  Barclays told the OFT about the improper disclosures, so
the London-based bank won’t face any penalty unless it ceases to
cooperate, the agency said.  The statement of objections means the banks will have a
chance to respond to the agency before it issues any final
decision on the matter.  To contact the reporter for this story:
