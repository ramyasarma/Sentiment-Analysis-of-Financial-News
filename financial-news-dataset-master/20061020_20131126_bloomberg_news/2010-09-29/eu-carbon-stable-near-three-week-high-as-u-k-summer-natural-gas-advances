European Union carbon-dioxide
allowances were little changed near their highest price in
almost three weeks after U.K. natural gas for summer jumped 5.4
percent in the past week to a two-month record.  EU allowances for December fell 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to
15.65 euros ($21.28) a metric ton as of 8:45 a.m. on London’s
European Climate Exchange. The contract closed at 15.67 euros
yesterday, its strongest level since Sept. 7.  U.K. gas for delivery in the six months from April advanced
2.8 percent to 49 pence a therm yesterday, the highest close
since July 13 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. That’s the
equivalent of $7.75 a million British thermal units. A therm’s
100,000 Btus. Higher gas prices may prompt some power generators
to switch from the fuel, which requires about half as many
carbon permits as coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
