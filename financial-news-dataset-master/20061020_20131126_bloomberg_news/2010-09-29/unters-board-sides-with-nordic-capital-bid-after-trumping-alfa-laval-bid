Munters AB , a Swedish maker of
dehumidifiers, said its board of directors sided with a takeover
bid by Nordic Capital AB after the private-equity company
trumped an offer from  Alfa Laval AB .  Nordic Capital subsidiary Cidron Interessenter AB is
offering 73 kronor a share, beating the 68 krona bid by Alfa
Laval earlier this month, Munters said today in a statement. The
board unanimously recommended that shareholders accept the
Nordic Capital bid, the Stockholm-based company said.  Munters surged as much as 6.6 percent today to 77.25 kroner
in Stockholm trading, indicating that investors expect a further
bidding contest.  “Nothing is closed,” regarding other potential offers,
Munters Chairman  Anders Ilstam  said in a phone interview.
“We are waiting for the market’s and for Alfa Laval’s
reaction.”  Nordic Capital’s bid values Munters at about 5.4 billion
kroner ($804 million), according to the private-equity firm. The
shares traded at 76.50 kroner at 9:29 a.m., giving Munters a
market value of 5.76 billion kroner.  “Alfa Laval’s board will respond after an evaluation,
which will happen as soon as possible,”  Peter Torstensson , an
Alfa Laval spokesman, said today.  The Munters board said Sept. 24 that it had contacted other
bidders and that the offer from Alfa Laval, the Lund, Sweden-
based maker of fluid-control equipment, didn’t take into account
the company’s long-term potential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
