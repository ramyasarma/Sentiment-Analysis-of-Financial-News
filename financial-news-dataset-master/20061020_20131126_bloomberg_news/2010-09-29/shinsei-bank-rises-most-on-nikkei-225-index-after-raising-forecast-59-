Shinsei Bank Ltd. shares rose after
boosting its fiscal 2012 profit forecast by 59 percent helped by
declining credit costs and expenses.  Tokyo-based Shinsei rose as much as 6.7 percent to 62 yen
in Tokyo and traded at 61 yen as of 9:51 a.m., leading gains
among stocks on Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The
Nikkei index added 0.4 percent.  Shinsei, the Japanese lender partly owned by J.  Christopher Flowers , raised its net income target to 51 billion yen ($606
million) from 32 billion yen, according to a statement to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday.  While credit costs are forecasts to wane, the bank also
said revenue for the period will be 258 billion yen, 7 billion
yen less than its previous forecast. Credit costs will be
49 billion yen, 14 billion yen lower than forecast, as it
reduces its consumer finance related assets.  Group-wide expenses will be 49 billion yen, 14 billion yen
less than forecast, it said in its revised medium-term plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
