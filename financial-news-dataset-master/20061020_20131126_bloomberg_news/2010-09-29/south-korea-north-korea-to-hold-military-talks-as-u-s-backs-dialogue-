South Korea and North Korea will
hold military talks today, South Korea’s defense ministry said
in an e-mailed statement.  The announcement came after both countries had proposed
resuming talks at the border village of Panmunjom earlier this
month.  South Korea wants to discuss issues including the sinking
of one of its warships, the Cheonan, in March, its defense
ministry said in a statement on Sept. 19. An international
inquiry blamed North Korea for the sinking, an accusation the
North has denied.  North Korea on Sept. 11 proposed discussions on holding
reunions of families separated since the 1950-53 war.  State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said yesterday
the U.S. welcomed the development. “We endorse dialogue between
North and South Korea as an important element to reducing
tensions on the peninsula,” Crowley said in a telephone
interview.  The new talks arose as the North’s ruling Workers’ Party
dealt with issues of leadership succession.  Kim Jong Un , the son
of ailing ruler  Kim Jong Il , was named to the party’s second-
highest military position Sept. 28, one day after he was made a
four-star general.  North Korea and South Korea remain technically at war since
their conflict ended in a cease-fire that was never replaced by
a peace treaty. The countries are separated by one of the
world’s most fortified borders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
