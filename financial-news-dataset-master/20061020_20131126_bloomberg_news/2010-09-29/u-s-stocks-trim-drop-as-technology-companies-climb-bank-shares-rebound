U.S. stocks trimmed losses as
energy and technology shares advanced and financial companies
rebounded from an early slump.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,146.78 at 12 p.m. in New York after tumbling as
much as 0.7 percent in earlier trading. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average slipped 9.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,849.05,
recovering most of a 56-point slide.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
