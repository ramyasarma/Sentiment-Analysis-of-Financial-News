Oil rose in New York as an increase
in Chinese manufacturing and a decline in U.S. supply bolstered
speculation fuel demand is rising in the world’s two biggest
energy users.  Futures rose for the fifth time in six days after a
purchasing managers’ index showed manufacturing in China, the
fastest-growing major economy, accelerated for a second month.
An Energy Department report today will probably show crude
inventories in the U.S. fell last week, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of analysts.  “Oil is proving resilient,” said  Alexander Ridgers , head
of commodities at London-based CMC Markets, which handles more
than $150 million a day in U.S. crude contracts. “There are
some good solid data coming out. Better figures suggest that the
global economy is improving.”  Crude for November delivery rose as much as 75 cents, or 1
percent, to $76.93 a barrel in electronic trading on the New

a barrel after rising as much as 1.1 percent to $79.59 a barrel.  Oil in New York has climbed 6.3 percent this month and is
poised for a 1.1 percent gain for the third quarter. Nymex
futures lost 9.7 percent between April and June, the first
decline in six quarters.  API Report  Yesterday, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute
said U.S. crude stockpiles decreased by 2.42 million barrels
last week to 361.7 million, the first reduction in three weeks.
Gasoline supplies gained 3.02 million barrels to 230.8 million,

largest energy user last year.  Tropical storm warnings were issued for parts of Florida,
the Cayman islands, Cuba and the Bahamas as a tropical

its path, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  The storm, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) south-southwest
of Miami, packed maximum winds of 35 miles per hour as it
