Mexico’s peso fell for a second
time this week on concern the economic recovery in the U.S., the
nation’s largest trading partner, may slow.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 12.5391 per dollar, at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.4981 yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.2 percent ahead of
reports for initial jobless claims and manufacturing data
scheduled to be released tomorrow and Oct. 1 in the U.S. The
U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  “There is evidently a lot of concern still about the data
coming out this week,’ said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with
Banco Santander SA in Mexico City. “This data may come out
weaker than expected and we have seen in the past that the peso
has reacted to this data.”  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.437 percent.
The price of the security fell 0.88 centavo to 133.08 centavos
per peso at, according to Banco Santander SA.  Traders didn’t exercise any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. So far this month,
$597 million in options have been triggered.  The central bank has been auctioning $600 million of dollar
options monthly, allowing it to purchase dollars as it seeks to
boost foreign reserves after the peso reached a record low last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
