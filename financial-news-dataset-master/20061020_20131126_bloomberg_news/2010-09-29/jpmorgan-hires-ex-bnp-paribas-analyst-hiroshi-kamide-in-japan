JPMorgan Chase & Co.  said it hired
 Hiroshi Kamide  from  BNP Paribas SA  as a senior analyst for the
software and game industry in Japan.  Kamide joined  JPMorgan Securities Japan Co.  today, and he
will start covering the area from November, the bank said in a
statement e-mailed to Bloomberg News. The Tokyo-based unit
hasn’t covered the software industry in Japan.  JPMorgan is among investment banks that are luring research
talent from rivals to earn more commissions and fees from
equity-related business in Japan. Kamide became at least the
third recruit by the Japanese unit in the past three months.  JPMorgan in July hired Dairo Murata, a former  Credit Suisse Group AG  analyst, to cover the retail industry, and employed
Masashi Itaya, also formerly of Credit Suisse, for the
electronic-component sector in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
