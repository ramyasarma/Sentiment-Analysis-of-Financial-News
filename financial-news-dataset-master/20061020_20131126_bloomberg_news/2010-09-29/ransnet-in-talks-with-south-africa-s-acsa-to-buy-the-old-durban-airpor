Transnet Ltd., South Africa’s
state-owned ports and freight-rail operator, is in talks with
Airports Co. South Africa to buy the old airport in Durban and
with the City of Durban to acquire land, Senior Project Manager
David Stromberg said.  If successful in acquiring land, Transnet could “more than
double” capacity at the Durban port, Stromberg said in a speech
in Johannesburg today. Given demand for growth, the port in the
southeastern city would need to be operational by 2019.  To contact the reporter on this story:
