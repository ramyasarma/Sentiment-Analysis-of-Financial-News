Morgan Stanley  had its third-
quarter earnings estimates cut by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analysts, who cited “soft” revenue from the firm’s fixed-
income, currency and commodities and equities divisions.  Morgan Stanley’s earnings-per-share estimate was reduced to
15 cents from 60 cents, analysts led by  Richard   Ramsden  said in
a note to clients dated yesterday. The analysts kept their
“neutral” recommendation on the stock.  “Investment bank earnings are likely to be soft in the
third quarter 2010, as evidenced by Jefferies’ shortfall last
week,” the analysts said. The largest adjustments are due to
“muted activity” in fixed income and equities, they said.  Jefferies Group Inc., the first Wall Street firm to release
third-quarter results, said Sept. 22 that revenue from trading
stocks and bonds dropped 51 percent in the three months though
August. Industry-wide bond-trading volume declined 12 percent in
the period, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Regulatory Authority.  The analysts also said it’s hard to gauge the impact of
implementing the Basel capital accords, in particular how the
rules will affect risk-weighted assets and capital ratios.  To contact the reporters on this story:
