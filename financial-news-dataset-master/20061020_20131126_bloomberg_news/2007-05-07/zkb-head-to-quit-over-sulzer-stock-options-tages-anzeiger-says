             The Chief Executive Officer of Zuercher
Kantonalbank,  Switzerland 's largest state-controlled regional
lender, will resign today, Tages-Anzeiger reported, citing
unidentified members of the bank's supervisory board.  
 Chief Executive Hans Voegeli will step down amid criticism
over stock options issued by Zuercher Kantonalbank that helped
Russian billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg 's  investment company  Renova
Group and the Austrian investment company Victory obtain a stake
in the industrial-pumps maker  Sulzer AG (SUN) , the newspaper said.  
 CEO-designate Martin Scholl, who was initially slated to
take the helm in January 2008, will take over Voegeli's role with
immediate effect, Tages-Anzeiger reported. A spokeswoman for ZKB,
who declined to provide her name, said the bank had no comment,
and that a spokesman would return Bloomberg's call later.
