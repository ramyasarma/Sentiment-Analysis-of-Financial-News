             Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp., a U.S.
steelmaker fighting an unsolicited merger proposal from Esmark
Inc., said a vote by investors to replace the board would force
the company to default on $475 million of loans.  
 Esmark, a Chicago-based steel distributor, is proposing a
slate of directors to replace the board at a Wheeling-Pittsburgh
shareholder meeting Nov. 17 in Wheeling, West Virginia. If
Esmark's candidates are elected, they are likely to scuttle
Wheeling-Pittsburgh's proposed merger with  Brazil 's Cia.
Siderurgica Nacional SA.  
 The $475 million of loans would become due ``immediately''
because of ``change of control'' clauses in agreements with
lenders, Wheeling-Pittsburgh said today in a statement.  
 Esmark, in a separate statement, said it anticipates no
problems in extending the loans.  
 ``In the unlikely event that these credit facilities were no
longer available to Wheeling-Pitt, we believe that replacement
financing would be readily available,'' Esmark Chief Executive
Officer James P. Bouchard said in the statement today.  
 Esmark wants to be bought by Wheeling-Pittsburgh for about
$273 million and then merge the two companies. It also has a loan
agreement for $350 million from banks led by J.P. Morgan Chase.
