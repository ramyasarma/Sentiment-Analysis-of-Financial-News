Policy easing in the U.S. will drive
a large amount of liquidity into emerging markets and challenge
those economies, the Shanghai Securities News reported, citing
Vice Chinese Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao.  That liquidity may become so-called hot money that flows in
and out of emerging markets for short-term gains, Zhu was cited
by the newspaper as saying at a conference on Nov. 6. Many
emerging economies may be forced to impose capital controls to
stem capital flows, Zhu was cited as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
