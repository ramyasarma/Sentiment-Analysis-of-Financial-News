Egypt said it didn’t buy pounds to
support the currency on Nov. 4, the day it strengthened the most
in almost six years against the U.S. dollar.  The increase was down to foreign investors buying Treasury
bills and companies selling dollars,  Hisham Ramez , deputy
governor or the central bank, said in a telephone interview.  “Like all over the world, investors are buying in emerging
markets,” Ramez said from Cairo. He declined to give the value
of Treasury bill purchases by foreigners.  The pound gained 1.1 percent to 5.716 per dollar on Nov. 4.
It had lost 1.4 percent between Oct. 15 and Nov. 3, crossing the
5.7755 level on Oct. 27 for the first time since August 2005.  The North African country’s central bank left the country’s
benchmark interest rate at 8.25 percent on Nov. 4, a four-year
low. The average yield on Egypt’s one-year Treasury bills sold
on that day in an auction was all but unchanged at 10.33 percent
from the previous sale.  Investors have bought a record $41 billion of emerging-
market bonds this year, according to data from EPFR Global, a
research firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
