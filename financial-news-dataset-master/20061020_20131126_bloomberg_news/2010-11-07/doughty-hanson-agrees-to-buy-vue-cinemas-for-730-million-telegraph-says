Vue Entertainment Ltd., the U.K.’s
third-largest cinema chain, has been sold to private equity firm
Doughty Hanson & Co. for 450 million pounds ($730 million), the
Sunday Telegraph said, without saying where it got the
information.  Doughty Hanson bid against private equity house BC Partners
and a Canadian pension fund, the Ontario Municipal Employee
Retirement System, according to the newspaper, which said
details of the deal are being finalized.  Nick Bastin, a London-based spokesman for Doughty Hanson,
declined to comment when contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
