Singapore Airlines Ltd. ,  Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd . and seven other carriers have resumed
flights to Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, that were suspended
because of ash from the Mount Merapi eruption, an airport
official said.  Other carriers that have restarted services include
 Malaysian Airline System Bhd , Japan Airlines Corp. and  China
Southern Airlines Co. , said Frans Yosef, an officer at PT
Angkasa Pura II, operator of the Soekarno-Hatta airport. Five
other airlines continue to suspend services, he said.  Merapi, Indonesian for mountain of fire, has been spewing
ash for two weeks. About 280,000 people sought shelters at
evacuation centers outside the 20-kilometer (12 miles) safety
zone after the latest big eruption on Nov. 5, the  National
Disaster Management Agency  said in a statement on its website.  There are still eight international flights to the
Indonesian capital by Philippine Airlines Inc., Jetstar Asia
Airways Ltd., Emirates,  Eva Airways Corp . and Value Air that are
suspended, Yosef said.  The volcano may release ash for as long as two months,
Subandriyo, an official at the Volcanology and Geology Disaster
Mitigation Center, said Nov. 3. The death toll reached 135 as of
noon today.  Cathay Pacific  said it will resume flight services between
Jakarta and Hong Kong from today. Two scheduled flights to
Jakarta this afternoon will operate as normal, and it will also
reinstate a canceled flight from the Indonesian capital, Cathay
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
