Australia beat Sri Lanka by eight
wickets in the third one-day cricket international today in
Brisbane to end the team’s run of seven straight losses in all
formats --its worst sequence in 14 years.  Australia, in its final match before the Ashes Test series
against England, bowled out Sri Lanka for 115 before racing to
victory in less than 22 overs with an unbeaten 50 from stand-in
captain Michael Clarke.  “It’s nice to get a win and all the boys will be a little
happier tonight,” Clarke told reporters. “We have been
disappointed with our results. But we are continuing to learn
and will get better from this.”  Clint McKay took 5-33 and Mitchell Starc -- in his second
one-day international -- claimed 4-27 as Sri Lanka was bowled
out in only 32 overs.  Clarke led the reply, with  Brad Haddin  scoring 31 in
Australia’s 119-2 before becoming one of two wickets for Dilhara
Fernando. Sri Lanka clinched a first series win in Australia by
2-1.  Australia, which hosts England in the best-of-five Ashes
series from Nov. 25, had last won in any format in the first
Test against Pakistan in July.  England captain  Andrew Strauss  scored 120 not out to lead
the tourists to a six-wicket win against Western Australia in
his team’s first Ashes warm-up in Perth.  On the final day of the three-day match, England bowled out
Western Australia for 223 before reaching 243-4 in its second
innings.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
