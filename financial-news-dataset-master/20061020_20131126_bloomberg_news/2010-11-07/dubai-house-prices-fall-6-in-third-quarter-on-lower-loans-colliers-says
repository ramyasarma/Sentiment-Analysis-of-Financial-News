Dubai house prices declined 6 percent
in the third quarter from the previous one as banks continued to
restrict lending and because of summer seasonal slowdown,
Colliers International said.  The Colliers house price index for Dubai reached the lowest
level since the second quarter of 2009, it said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
