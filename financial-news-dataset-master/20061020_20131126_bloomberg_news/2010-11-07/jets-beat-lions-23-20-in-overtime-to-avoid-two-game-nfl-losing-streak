Nick Folk kicked a 30-yard field goal
in overtime as the New York Jets beat the Detroit Lions 23-20.  The Jets (6-2) avoided back-to-back losses by rallying from
a 20-10 deficit in the final three minutes of the fourth
quarter. Folk forced overtime with a 36-yard field goal with
four seconds left and his winning kick was set up by a long
reception by Santonio Holmes.   The Jets tie New England for first place in the American
Football Conference’s East Division. The Patriots (6-2) lost to
the Cleveland Browns 34-14.  The Lions fell to 2-6 and were denied their first winning
streak since the 2007 season.        The Minnesota Vikings beat Arizona 27-24 in overtime after
rallying from a 24-10 fourth-quarter deficit. Elsewhere in Week
9 of the National Football League season, it was Atlanta 27,
Tampa Bay 21; New Orleans 34, Carolina 3; Baltimore 26, Miami
10; Chicago 22, Buffalo 19; and San Diego Chargers 29, Houston
