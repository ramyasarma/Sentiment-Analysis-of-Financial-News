Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd., a
global consultancy firm, expects the number of mergers and
acquisitions in the Middle East to double in 2011 as regional
economies expand and governments spend on infrastructure.  "There is return to positive economic growth in the region,
making it an attractive market for multinational companies,"
Chairman  John Connolly  said in an interview in Dubai on Nov. 5.
"There is a demand for high quality advisory and consulting
services in the Middle East." The number of deals will rise to
about 1,500 from 750 in 2010,  Connolly  said in an e-mail today.  Confidence has returned to the region as Dubai World
secured approval for the terms of its restructuring of $24.9
billion in debt last month, Connolly said. The International
Monetary Fund said Oct. 6 economic growth in the Middle East and
North Africa region may accelerate to 5.1 percent next year as
oil prices rise.  Dubai’s Supreme Fiscal Committee hired Deloitte to lead the
restructuring of the debt-laden state-owned company. Deloitte’s
 Aidan Birkett , appointed chief restructuring officer at Dubai
World, left his role on Oct. 13. "We consider the restructuring
of Dubai World complete," Connolly said. "We are expecting more
restructuring activity in the region next year, but not a
surge."  Deloitte expects a double-digit increase in resources in
the region over the next three to five years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
