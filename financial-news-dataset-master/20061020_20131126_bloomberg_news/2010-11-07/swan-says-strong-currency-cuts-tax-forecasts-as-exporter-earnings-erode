The advancing Australian dollar, the
best-performing major currency against the greenback since July,
is cutting into tax receipts as the local value of export
earnings declines, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said.  The government will release its mid-year economic and
fiscal outlook on Nov. 9, detailing the impact the currency had
on forecast tax revenue, Swan said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The so-called Aussie closed above parity with the U.S.
dollar for a third day on Nov. 5 as investors bet the nation
will increase interest rates to slow inflation. That’s
offsetting gains in prices for Australia’s export commodities,
including iron ore and coal, which are negotiated in the U.S.
currency, Swan said today.  “The biggest factor in the mid-year update will be the
negative impact the high Australian dollar is having on
revenues,” Swan said. “The higher dollar means our exporters
bring home less income and that flows through to reduced company
and resource taxes.”  The higher local dollar will cut mining tax revenues, Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  told Channel Nine today, without being
more specific. The total tax take may fall by as much as A$10
billion ($10.2 billion), the Australian newspaper  reported  Nov.
6, without saying where it got the information.  The government’s proposed 30 percent tax on profit from
coal and iron ore mines was forecast to bring in an extra A$10.5
billion of tax in the first two years from producers including
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company, and Rio
Tinto Group, Swan said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
