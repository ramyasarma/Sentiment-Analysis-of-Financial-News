The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose less than 1 cent to
$2.8276 a gallon, according to a survey.  The price rose four-tenths of a penny in the two-week
period ended Nov. 5, according to data provided by 2,500 filling
stations nationwide to  Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline
analyst in Camarillo, California.  Crude oil and gasoline futures prices rose in the two weeks
ended Nov. 5 as the dollar lost 0.6 percent against the euro,
the Federal Reserve moved to shore up the economy and gains in
the U.S. service sector and factory orders signaled the economy
is strengthening.  Gasoline prices don’t yet reflect the rising cost of crude,
Lundberg said in a telephone interview today. “In the very next
few days, consumers will pay 10 cents per gallon more for both
gasoline and diesel.”  Rising prices are “an offshoot of federal monetary
policies,” she said. “The Fed’s policies have been weakening
the dollar and sending investment to commodities.”  The Fed announced Nov. 3 it will buy an additional $600
billion of Treasuries to avoid deflation and spur job growth, in
a second round of quantitative easing dubbed QE2.  The Labor Department on Nov. 5 said U.S. payrolls expanded
for the first time in five months, indicating fuel demand will
increase.  Crude Price Rise  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of  non-
manufacturing  businesses improved to 54.3, from 53.2 in
September. Factory  bookings  expanded 2.1 percent, according to
the Commerce Department.  The front-month contract for crude oil rose $5.16 during
the two weeks ended Nov. 5, gaining 6.3 percent to $86.85 a
barrel. That’s the highest settlement for the contract closest
to expiration since Oct. 8, 2008.  During that same two-week period, gasoline futures
increased 5.6 percent to $2.18 a gallon, the highest price for
the front-month contract since Aug. 3.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  as of Oct. 29 were the lowest in
11 months, according to the Energy Department. Supplies were 6
percent above the five-year average for the period. Crude oil
inventories were 14 percent above the five-year average.  Demand  for gasoline, as measured by what refiners and
blenders supply to wholesalers, fell 3.7 percent from the prior
week, the department said Nov. 3.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump fell 0.8 percent in the
week ended Oct. 29 to a three-week low, according to  MasterCard
Inc.  in its Nov. 2 SpendingPulse report.  On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $3.01 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.07 a
gallon.  The highest price in the continental U.S. was in San
Francisco at $3.16 a gallon. The cheapest place to buy the fuel
was Memphis, Tennessee, where a gallon averaged $2.58, according
to Lundberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
