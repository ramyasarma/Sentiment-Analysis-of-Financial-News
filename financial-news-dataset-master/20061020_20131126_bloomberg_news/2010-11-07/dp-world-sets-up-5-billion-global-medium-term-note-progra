DP World Ltd. , the world’s fourth-
biggest port operator, updated a prospectus for its $5 billion
global medium-term note program, according to a  statement  posted
on the website of Nasdaq Dubai.  DP World applied to the U.K.’s Financial Services Authority
to sell notes under the program at any time within the next 12
months from Nov. 4, the prospectus said today. Citigroup Inc.,
Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc
have been hired as arrangers, it said.  DP World , controlled by state-owned Dubai World, had $8.04
billion of debt at the end of June, according to the document.
The port operator has a $1.5 billion Islamic bond due 2017 and a
$1.75 billion bond due 2037, both sold in 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
