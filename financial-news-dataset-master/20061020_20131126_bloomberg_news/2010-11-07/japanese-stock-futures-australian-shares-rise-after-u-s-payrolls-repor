added more jobs than forecast, boosting confidence in the
world’s largest economy.  American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. , a Japanese
carmaker that receives about 42 percent of its revenue from
North America, climbed 0.9 percent from the closing share price

than 80 percent of its sales overseas, advanced 0.2 percent.
