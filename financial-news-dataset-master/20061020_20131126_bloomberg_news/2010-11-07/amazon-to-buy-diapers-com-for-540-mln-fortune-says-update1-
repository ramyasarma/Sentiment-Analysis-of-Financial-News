Amazon.com Inc.  is likely to announce
tomorrow the purchase of Quidsi Inc., the parent company of
Diapers.com, for $540 million in cash, Fortune reported, without
citing anyone.  The offer values Diapers.com at $200 million more than in a
recent round of venture capital fundraising, the magazine said
in a story published online late yesterday.  Amazon had previously bid for the company, Fortune said.
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  also had bid, the magazine said.  Quidsi, founded by  Marc Lore  and  Vinit Bharara , generated
about $180 million in revenue last year and is expected to post
revenue of about $300 million in 2010. Shareholders include
Accel Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, BEV Capital,
MentorTech Ventures and New Enterprise Associates, the magazine
said.  The company doesn’t make a profit on selling diapers,
instead by retaining customers who buy higher-margin products
such as brand-name baby shampoo, wipes and formula, Bloomberg
BusinessWeek reported last month.  Amazon began selling diapers in mid-2006, a year after
Diapers.com debuted. The company began offering a free three-
month trial of Amazon Prime to mothers ordering diapers and
other baby items to counter Diapers.com’s free shipping,
Bloomberg BusinessWeek said.  There was no answer at a telephone listed for Diapers.com
when Bloomberg News attempted to contact the company. Amazon
didn’t immediately respond to voicemail and e-mail inquiries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
