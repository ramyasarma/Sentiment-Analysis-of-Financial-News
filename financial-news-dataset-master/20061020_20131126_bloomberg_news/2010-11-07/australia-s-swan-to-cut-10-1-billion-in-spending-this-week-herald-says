Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan will
cut government spending by as much as A$10 billion ($10.1
billion) in a budget update scheduled to be released tomorrow to
combat the fall in taxation revenue caused by the rising
Australian dollar, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported
today, without saying where it got the information.  The Department of Finance warned the projected return to
surplus in 2012-13 would be “difficult to achieve” without
spending cuts, the newspaper reported, citing briefing documents
to Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s incoming government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
