AFC Wimbledon will play its
forerunner MK Dons in the next stage of English soccer’s F.A.
Cup if both teams win first-round replays.  AFC Wimbledon yesterday drew 0-0 at home to Ebbsfleet while
MK Dons tied in a scoreless match at Stevenage.  AFC Wimbledon was formed by fans in 2002 to preserve the
heritage of the original team when the Wimbledon club was
renamed and moved to Milton Keynes. The new team has fought its
way up to the fifth level of English soccer, one step below the
Football League, where MK Dons play in the third tier.  Wimbledon won the F.A. Cup in 1988, upsetting Liverpool 1-0
in the final.  Among other games in the draw made today, non-league FC
United of Manchester, which beat third-division Rochdale 3-2 two
days ago, will travel to Brighton or Woking in the second round.
FC United was formed by fans opposed to the takeover of
Manchester United by the Glazer family of the U.S.  Teams from the Premier League and Championship will enter
the F.A. Cup, soccer’s oldest cup competition, in the third
round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
