Real Madrid beat Atletico Madrid 2-0
to stay one point ahead of Barcelona atop Spanish soccer’s
Primera Liga, while Lazio’s lead in Italy was halved after a 2-0
loss in the Rome derby.  Ricardo Carvalho  and  Mesut Ozil , who were signed by Real
manager  Jose Mourinho  in the offseason, scored first-half goals
at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium last night as Real extended its
winning home run against its cross-town rival to 12 games.  The victory reestablished Real’s lead at the top of the
standings after defending champion Barcelona earlier went two
points clear following a 3-1 win at Getafe. Villarreal has 23
points in third after beating Athletic Bilbao 4-1.  In Rome, second-half penalty kicks by Marco Borriello and
Mirko Vucinic sealed the win for Roma. Lazio, which led Serie A
by four points before the weekend, has 22 points, two more than
AC Milan, which won 3-2 at last-place Bari yesterday.  Inter Milan is third on 19 after a 1-1 draw with Brescia
two days ago. Juventus and Napoli have 18 points, with Sampdoria
and Roma on 15.  In Germany, Borussia Dortmund extended its lead to four
points after a 4-0 win at Hanover yesterday. Second-place Mainz
lost 1-0 at Freiburg a day earlier.  Brest still leads in France after a 3-1 defeat at Lille
yesterday as Paris Saint-Germain beat Marseille 2-1 in the late
game to prevent the defending champion from going top.  In the Netherlands, FC Twente leads by a point after a 2-1
win over Excelsior two days ago. PSV Eindhoven is second after
beating Utrecht 2-1 yesterday, while Ajax lost 1-0 at home to
Den Haag.  WEEKEND RESULTS
