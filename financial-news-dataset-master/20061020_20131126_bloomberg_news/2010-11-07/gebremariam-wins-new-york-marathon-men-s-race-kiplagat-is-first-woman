Haile Gebrselassie  said he will
retire from competitive running after dropping out of his first
 New York Marathon  as fellow Ethiopian Gebre Gebremariam won in
his debut at the distance.  Two-time Olympic 10,000-meter champion and marathon world
record holder Gebrselassie pulled out of yesterday’s race after
16 miles (25.7 kilometers) with a knee injury.  “I have discussed it with myself and I think it’s better
to stop here,” the 37-year-old, who set 27 world records at
track and road distances ranging from 2,000 meters to the
marathon during an 18-year career, told reporters. “Let me do
another job. Let me give the youngsters a chance.”  Gebrselassie turned to the marathon after failing in 2004
to become the first man to win the Olympic 10,000 meters three
times. He ran the 2008 Berlin marathon in 2 hours, 3 minutes, 59
seconds to shave 27 seconds off the world record he set at the
same event a year earlier. An asthmatic, Gebrselassie missed the
2008 Olympics in Beijing because of concerns about pollution.  He had lined up for yesterday’s race a day after scans
showed fluid and tendonitis in his right knee and ran with the
leaders before pulling up.  “I knew about this problem when I arrived in New York,”
said Gebrselassie. “I thought that it was not serious, but
things happen which I can’t change. I don’t want to complain
anymore after this, which means it’s better to stop here.”  Gebremariam won the race in 2:08:14. Kenya’s Emmanuel Mutai
was next to finish, 64 seconds behind, and Moses Kigen Kipkosgei,
also of Kenya, was third in 2:10:39.  ‘So Special’  “It’s so special for me just to finish,” the 26-year-old
Gebremariam told reporters.  Gebremariam, the 2009 cross-country world champion, is the
only man to win in New York at the first attempt since Rod Dixon
in 1983.  Edna Kiplagat won the women’s race in 2:28:20. Shalane
Flanagan of the U.S. was runner-up, 20 seconds behind Kiplagat
and 21 seconds ahead of third-placed Mary Keitany, another
Kenyan. Three U.S. women finished among the top 10.  Meb Keflezighi, who in 2009 became the first American man
to win the New York Marathon in 27 years, was the top U.S. men’s
finisher in sixth place. Keflezighi, who was born in Eritrea and
became a U.S. citizen in 1998, was the only runner from the host
nation to win the race since Alberto Salazar, who triumphed
three years in a row from 1980 through 1982.  Almost 45,000 runners take part in the 26 mile, 385-yard
race, which begins on Staten Island and winds through Brooklyn,
Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx before finishing in Central Park.
Gebremariam and Kiplagat earned $130,000, with the second-placed
runners receiving $65,000. Prize money totaled $600,000.  Gimelstob Wins Bet  Former professional tennis player and marathon first-timer
 Justin Gimelstob  won a $10,000 charity bet with 2003 U.S. Open
champion  Andy Roddick  by running the course in less than 4 hours,
45 minutes. Gimelstob, 33, crossed the line in 4:09:58 to earn
the money for the Justin Gimelstob Children’s Fund for pediatric
cancer.  Gimelstob is seeking to raise another $20,000-$30,000 for
his foundation and youth programs of the race organizer, the New
York Road Runners, which says the marathon is the most
philanthropic annual sports event in the U.S., producing $26.2
million.  A Chilean miner known as “the Runner” completed the
course in 5 hours, 40 minutes after keeping fit during a 69-day
underground incarceration by jogging through subterranean
tunnels. The 34-year-old Edison Pena was one of 33 miners
trapped 2,300 feet (701 meters) down the mine in northern Chile
after a cave-in.  David Weir of the U.K. won the wheelchair race in 1:37:29,
two seconds ahead of Masazumi Soejima of Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
