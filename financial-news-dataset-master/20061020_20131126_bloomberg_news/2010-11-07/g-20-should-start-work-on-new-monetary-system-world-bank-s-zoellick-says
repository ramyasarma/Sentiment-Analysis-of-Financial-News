The development of a monetary system
to follow on from 1971’s Bretton Woods II will take time, but
it’s time to start, World Bank President Robert Zoellick writes
in the Financial Times.  This week’s summit of the Group of 20 leading economies in
Seoul presents a test of international cooperation offering an
opportunity for a key group of G20 countries to agree on
parallel agendas of structural reform, Zoellick writes.  For instance, the U.S. and China could reach agreement on
mutually reinforcing moves to stimulate further growth, such as
a course for yuan appreciation, or a move to wide bands for
exchange rates, the World Bank chief writes.  Other major economies should agree to forgo currency
intervention, except in rare situations agreed to by others,
Zoellick says. These moves would help emerging economies to deal
with asymmetries in recoveries by applying flexible exchange
rates and independent monetary policies, he writes.  The system should evaluate using gold as a reference point
of market expectations about inflation, deflation and future
currency values, Zoellick writes, noting that while textbooks
may view gold as “old money,” markets use it today as an
alternative monetary asset.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
