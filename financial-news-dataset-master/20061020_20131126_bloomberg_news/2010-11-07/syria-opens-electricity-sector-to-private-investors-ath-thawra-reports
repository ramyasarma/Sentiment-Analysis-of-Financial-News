Syria’s parliament passed a law to
allow private investors to generate and distribute electricity,
Ath Thawra said, citing Electricity Minister  Ahmad Qusay Kayali .  The new law, which requires a presidential decree to come
into effect, allows for private investments in the sector either
as part of a partnership with the state or on its own. In either
cases, the state will be responsible for setting prices for the
electricity, he said.  Private investors will be able to directly sell the
electricity they generate to Syria’s corporate consumers in
return for transfer fees paid to the government, he said.  The law also provides incentives for private investments in
renewable energy projects, he said. Syria, the largest oil
producer in the eastern Mediterranean, is seeking alternative
energy sources as crude output falls from its 1996 peak.  Syria’s demand for electricity stood at 44.5 billion
kilowatts in 2009, an annual increase of 5.9 percent, according
to figures from the state-run  Public Establishment for
Electrical Generation and Transfer , known as PEEGT. Power supply
reached 43.3 billion kilowatts last year, with an annual growth
of 5.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
