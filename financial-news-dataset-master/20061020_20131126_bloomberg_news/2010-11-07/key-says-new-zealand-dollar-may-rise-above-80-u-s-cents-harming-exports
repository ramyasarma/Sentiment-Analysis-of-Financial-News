New Zealand dollar, the strongest
performer of 16 major currencies the last week, is likely to
rise above 80 U.S. cents and cause further problems for the
nation’s exporters, Prime Minister  John Key  said today.  The dollar was “probably going a little bit higher than”
80 cents, Key said in an interview with Television New Zealand
today. It reached 79.76 U.S. cents on Nov. 4, the highest since
April 2008.  “It’s very problematic,” Key said. “If you’re making
something that’s not linked to a commodity price, it’s a big
problem.”  The government was not planning to intervene in the New
Zealand dollar’s rally as it was a “very expensive” course of
action and there was little evidence it had worked in the past,
said Key. The country’s exchange rate last rose above 80 U.S.
cents on April 24, 2008.  “What’s forcing it up is, as we know, a very weak U.S.
economy,” Key said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
