Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on speculation that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will cut
its estimate for domestic grain production.  Twenty-one of 26 traders and analysts surveyed from Chicago
to Tokyo on Nov. 5 said corn will climb, and 19 respondents said
soybeans will advance. Last week, corn futures for December
delivery rose 1 percent to $5.8775 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Soybean futures for January delivery climbed 3.9
percent to $12.84 a bushel. The USDA will release its monthly
crop projections on Nov. 9.  Last week’s gains were expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on Oct. 29. Since 2004, the surveys have
been correct 51 percent of the time for corn and 54 percent for
soybeans.  Bullish  on corn: 21   Bullish  on soybeans: 19
