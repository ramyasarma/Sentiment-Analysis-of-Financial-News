Joe Paterno  became the first major-
college football coach to tally 400 wins as Penn State came back
from a three-touchdown deficit to beat Northwestern University
35-21.  Paterno, who will turn 85 on Dec. 21, is the first coach in
the Football Bowl Subdivision to reach 400 victories and the
third overall. In his 45th season at the university in State
College, Pennsylvania, he has a record of 400-132-3.  “People ask me why I’ve stayed here so long, and you know
what?” he asked the fans yesterday at Beaver Stadium after the
game. “Look around, look around. Now that the celebration’s
over, let’s go beat Ohio State.”  The Nittany Lions’ next game is against Ohio State
University in Columbus, Ohio, on Nov. 13. The Buckeyes are 8-1
after beating Minnesota 52-10 yesterday.  Paterno’s victory total trails two coaches at schools in
lower divisions.  Eddie Robinson  had 408 wins at Grambling State
University and  John Gagliardi  got his 477th win yesterday when
St. John’s University in Collegeville, Minnesota, beat St.
Olaf’s College 42-17.  Matt McGloin passed for four touchdowns in the second half
as the Nittany Lions (6-3, 3-2 Big Ten) rallied from a 21-7
halftime deficit against Northwestern. He completed 18 of 29
passes for 225 yards.  Northwestern’s Dan Persa ran for two touchdowns and threw
for a third to put the Wildcats (6-3, 2-3) up 21-0. Persa
completed 16 of 25 passes for 201 yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
