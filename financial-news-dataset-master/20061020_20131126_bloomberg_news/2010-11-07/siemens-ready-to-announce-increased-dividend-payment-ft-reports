Siemens AG this week will announce an
increase in dividend payment along with a new growth target, the
Financial Times reported.  Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher will reveal a
“significant” rise in the dividend payout, compared with last
year’s 1.60 euros, the newspaper said. The group will also
present a ratio for future dividend payments based on profit,
the FT said.  Siemens will drop its plan to increase revenue at a rate of
twice that of global gross domestic product, and will, instead,
compare its growth against that of its principal rivals, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
