Abu Dhabi stocks rose the most in
more than two weeks as global shares and oil gained after the
Federal Reserve announced another round of bond purchases to
boost the world’s biggest economy. Dubai’s benchmark dropped.  First Gulf Bank PJSC , the United Arab Emirates lender
controlled by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, climbed to the highest
since May.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC  increased to the
highest this year. The  ADX General Index  rose 0.7 percent, the
most since Oct. 21, to 2,770.37 at the 2 p.m. close in Abu
Dhabi. Dubai’s  measure  lost 0.9 percent as  Arabtec Holding Co. 
and  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC  posted lower quarterly earnings. The
 TA-25  in Tel Aviv added 0.3 percent.  Global stocks jumped last week after the Fed announced
plans to buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries in a
second round of quantitative easing. The central bank kept its
pledge to hold interest rates low for an “extended period”
after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the program could be
modified in some way. The dollar last week fell the most in four
against the currencies of six major trading partners.  “The dollar exchange rate may depreciate” further and
“could eventually make U.A.E. assets cheap for international
investors,” said  Nabil Farhat,  partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al
Fajer Securities. All of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s members
except Kuwait peg their currencies to the dollar.  In the U.S., the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  ended the week
with a gain of 3.6 percent at the highest in more than two
years. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  increased 2.3 percent in the
week and the 21-country benchmark  MSCI Emerging Markets Index 
surged 4.5 percent.  Oil Climbs  Crude oil rallied 6.7 percent, ending the week at $86.85 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement price in more than two years. The six nations of the
Gulf Cooperation Council, including the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia,
supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  First Gulf jumped 3.9 percent to 17.55 dirhams, the highest
since May 24. National Bank of Abu Dhabi rose 2.1 percent to
12.25 dirhams, the highest since December.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index  declined to 1,721.66, the lowest
in a month.  Arabtec lost 5.1 percent, the most since May 25, to 2.04
dirhams. The biggest construction company in the U.A.E. by
market value reported a 96 percent drop in third-quarter profit,
missing analysts’ estimates as a property slump and project
cancellations hurt earnings.  Dubai Islamic, the biggest Shariah-compliant lender in the
U.A.E., retreated 3.8 percent, the most since April, as
quarterly profit fell 10 percent to 270 million dirhams ($74
million).  Deyaar Development  slumped 7.8 percent, the most since
May, after posting a third-quarter loss.  Israel Bonds  The Israel Corp. climbed 1 percent to 4,011 shekels.  Clal
Finance  Brokerage Ltd. raised its price estimate on the holding
company controlled by the Ofer family to 4,400 shekels from
3,700 shekels.  Israeli bonds tracked a decline in Treasuries after U.S.
payrolls report showed employers added more jobs in October than
analysts had forecast. The yield on Israel’s benchmark 5 percent
Mimshal Shiklit bond due in January 2020 rose 3 basis points to
4.33 percent. The shekel weakened 0.4 percent to 3.5848 per
dollar on Nov. 5.  Oman’s  MSM30 Index  added 0.5 percent. Qatar’s  QE Index
