Australia’s dollar traded near a
record high versus the greenback on speculation the yield
advantage of assets in the South Pacific nation will widen as
the Federal Reserve pumps money into the U.S. economy.  The Australian dollar traded above parity with the U.S.
currency for a fourth day after the Reserve Bank of Australia
said this month economic growth will quicken next year and the
Aussie’s advance will help slow inflation. New Zealand’s dollar
dropped from near the strongest since April 2008 after a vine
infection was discovered at a kiwifruit orchard and data showed
the nation’s cash deficit was wider than earlier estimates.  “Risk appetite has improved a lot,” said  Greg Gibbs , a
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
Sydney. Higher-yielding currencies "should still perform well
against the euro and the yen.’’  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0146 at 12:06 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0159 in New York on Nov. 5, when it climbed to
$1.0183, the strongest since exchange controls were scrapped in
1983. The currency was at 82.42 yen from 82.54 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar dropped 0.6 percent to 79.08 U.S.
cents after rising to 79.76 cents on Nov. 4, the strongest since
April 2008. The so-called kiwi slipped 0.6 percent to 64.23 yen.  The Reserve Bank of Australia reiterated its forecast that
economic growth will accelerate to 3.75 percent by the end of
next year, climbing to 4 percent by the end of 2012, according
to its quarterly report released Nov. 5. Consumer prices will
rise 2.75 percent through June 2012, the RBA said. The central
bank had estimated inflation of 3.25 percent through mid-2011.  Extra Yield  “You have to see extraordinary strength in upcoming data
in Australia for the RBA to move in December,” said Adam Carr,
a senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “They have
expressed the desire to get the rate higher but they don’t want
to destabilize the recovery."  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand. U.S. policy makers kept their rate at
zero to 0.25 percent last week, and the Bank of Japan held its
benchmark at zero to 0.1 percent.  The  extra yield  investors get by investing in two-year
Australian government debt compared with similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries climbed to 4.68 percentage points, up from this
year’s low of 3.19 percentage points on Feb. 2.  ‘Caused Some Selling’  New Zealand said it is trying to prevent the spread of a
newly discovered vine infection from a North Island kiwifruit
orchard. Testing is under way to determine whether the infection
is bacterial kiwifruit vine disease PSA, Biosecurity Minister
David Carter said in an e-mailed statement.  ‘‘The headline about kiwifruit disease may have caused some
selling on concerns about the export impact,” said  Imre Speizer , a market strategist in Wellington at Westpac Banking
Corp. “Still, the fruit only accounts for about 2.5 percent of
merchandise, so the long-term implications are small.”  New Zealand’s dollar may fall as low as 77.50 cents after
the kiwifruit disease report, though it is likely to rebound on
the improving economic outlook if risk appetite remains strong,
Speizer said.  The kiwi dollar also fell as data showed the nation’s
budget cash deficit was wider than the government forecast last
quarter. The deficit totaled NZ$6.45 billion ($5.1 billion) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, or NZ$885 million more than
forecast in May’s budget, the Treasury Department said in a
statement released in Wellington today.  The kiwi is likely to rise above 80 U.S. cents and cause
further problems for the nation’s exporters, Prime Minister John
Key said today. The government was not planning to intervene as
it was a “very expensive” course of action and there was
little evidence it had worked in the past, said Key.  Australian bond futures were little changed, with the 10-
year contract for December delivery at 94.690 on the Sydney
Futures Exchange from 94.730 yesterday. The implied yield on the
futures stood at 5.31 percent from 5.27 percent.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, rose to 4.0275. It climbed to 4.11 on
Nov. 5, the highest level since July 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
