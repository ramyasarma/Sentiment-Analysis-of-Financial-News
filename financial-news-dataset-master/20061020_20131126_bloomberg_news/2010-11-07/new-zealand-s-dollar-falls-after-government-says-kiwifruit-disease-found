The New Zealand dollar dropped after
the government said precautions have been put in place to
prevent the spread of a newly discovered vine infection from a
North island kiwifruit orchard.  The currency fell to as low as 79 U.S. cents, before
trading at 79.09 cents as of 12:24 p.m. in Wellington, from
79.55 cents in New York on Nov. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
