Global supplies of oilseed may
tighten by April because of growing demand for food and
biodiesel, Larry Li, trading director of Noble Grain China, said
at a conference in Guangzhou.  The surge in prices of oilseed in recent weeks has exceeded
some people’s expectations, Li said. While the price may be
“quite high” based on demand and supply alone, the market is
further being bolstered by economic factors such as rising
liquidity, Li said.  -- William Bi . Editors:  Allen Wan   To contact the reporter on this story:
