Most German stocks fell, after the
benchmark DAX Index rose to its highest level since June 2008
last week, as Commerzbank AG and utilities led declines.  Commerzbank  retreated 4.1 percent after profit in the third
quarter missed analysts’ estimates. Siemens AG advanced 1.4
percent as Europe’s largest engineering company predicted green
technology sales of 40 billion euros ($55.7 billion) by 2014.
 Adidas AG  rose 1.6 percent as the world’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker aims to increase sales as much as 50
percent by 2015, Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer  said.  The DAX slipped 0.1 percent to 6,750.50 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Frankfurt. The measure increased 2.3 percent last week
as the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it will buy a further $600
billion of bonds in an attempt to bolster the world’s largest
economy. The broader HDAX Index was little changed today.  “With last week’s rally being supported by significant
cash injections into the system, the steam is perhaps a little
more likely to run out in Europe and the U.S.”  Chris Weston , an
institutional dealer at IG Markets in Melbourne, said.  Exports from Germany , Europe’s largest economy, rose in
September after two months of declines. Sales abroad, adjusted
for working days and seasonal changes, increased 3 percent from
August, when they fell 0.2 percent, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists had forecast a 1.5
percent gain, according to the median of 16 estimates in a
 Bloomberg News survey . Imports dropped 1.5 percent in September.  German Industrial Production  Industrial production  in the country unexpectedly declined
in September, adding to signs that Europe’s largest economy is
losing momentum. Output fell 0.8 percent from August, when it
rose 1.5 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today.
Economists had forecast a 0.4 percent gain, the median of 35
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. From a year
earlier, production increased 7.9 percent when adjusted for the
number of work days.  Commerzbank, Germany’s second-biggest bank, sank 4.1
percent to 6.35 euros after reporting third-quarter net income
of 113 million euros, missing the 148.4 million-euro average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “I would have expected Commerzbank to benefit more from
the economic recovery,” said  Konrad Becker , an analyst at Merck
Finck & Co. in Munich who recommends selling the stock. “The
retail bank performed badly.”  E.ON, Siemens  E.ON AG  lost 1.2 percent to 22.35 euros. Germany’s largest
utility may sell its U.K. electricity grid to help pay for a tax
that the German government will levy on its nuclear operations
from next year, according to two people familiar with the
matter.  Separately, baseload power for 2011 in Europe’s biggest
electricity market slipped 25 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 46.80
euros ($65.30) a megawatt-hour at 9:55 a.m. Berlin time, its
lowest price since April 7, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. RWE AG, Germany’s second-largest utility, lost 1.3
percent to 50.62 euros.  Siemens  rose 1.4 percent to 85.10 euros, the highest price
since March 2008. The engineering company generated total
revenue from environmental products of 28 billion euros in the
fiscal year through September. Siemens had previously targeted
sales of at least 25 billion euros by 2011.  Adidas rallied 1.6 percent to 47.03 euros, the first
advance in three days. Revenue will rise to 17 billion euros by
2015, increasing annually by an average of 15 percent, Hainer
said today on a conference call with investors. Profit will rise
faster than sales, he also said.  Manz Automation AG  slipped 3.1 percent to 50.30 euros as
the maker of machinery for the solar-panel industry reported a
nine-month net loss of 1.6 million euros.  QSC AG  surged 2.8 percent to 1.87 euros, the highest price
in more than a year. The telecommunications company said third-
quarter net income rose to 5.8 million euros from 2.1 million
euros, as revenue gained.  Rhoen-Klinikum AG dropped 2.7 percent to 16.17 euros. The
operator of rehabilitation and emergency health-care facilities
was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at Commerzbank, which
said it cut its “assumptions for external growth in the coming
years, as municipalities appear to keep on holding their breath
on the sale of assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
