Formula One motor racing champion
 Jenson Button  escaped unhurt after armed assailants approached
his car in Sao Paulo, his McLaren team said.  The incident happened yesterday, on the eve of today’s
Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos.  “The police driver of Jenson’s vehicle reacted swiftly
and, using avoidance techniques, rapidly forced his way through
the traffic, taking Jenson and the other occupants of the car
immediately away from any danger and back to their hotel,”
McLaren said in a statement.  Button was traveling from the circuit with his father,
John, his physiotherapist Mike Collier and manager Richard
Goddard. They were in a reinforced armored vehicle, moving
slowly along a busy road near a shanty town, Button said. He
praised his driver.  “I saw a dog come out, which was very cute. The next thing
I saw was a man with a gun,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “I
said ‘Isn’t that a gun?’ and as soon as I said that, the driver
angled the car and floored it. That’s when we saw six men, all
of them brandishing machine guns.  “My driver was a legend. He bounced off about five cars.
We were driving over the top of them. It was very scary.”  The Sao Paulo authorities will provide additional security
to transfer Button and other team personnel to the Interlagos
circuit for the Grand Prix, McLaren said. Button, who’s fifth in
the standings, starts 11th on the grid in the second-to-last
race of the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
