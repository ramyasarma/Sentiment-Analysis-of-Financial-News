The U.S. will work with Australia to
establish an international Commission of Inquiry to hold leaders
in Myanmar, also known as Burma, accountable for human rights
violations, Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said today.  Clinton was speaking in Melbourne where she is spending two
days meeting with Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  and her
Australian counterpart  Kevin Rudd  to discuss trade, climate
change and regional institutions. She and Rudd will meet with
the U.S. and Australian defense ministers tomorrow to work on
security and terrorism issues.  Clinton noted that today Myanmar is holding elections that
she said were “deeply flawed” and “once again exposes the
abuses of the military junta.” Clinton said the U.S. “holds
out hope that new players will emerge in Burma who are committed
to pursuing democratic reforms.”  Asia remains the only place in the world where three Nobel
laureates,  Aung San Suu Kyi  of Myanmar, the  Dalai Lama , and  Liu Xiaobo , a Chinese activist, are either under house arrest, in
prison, or in exile, Clinton said.  “The United States will continue to make clear to Burma’s
leaders that they must break from the policies of the past,”
Clinton said.  Clinton is on a two-week tour of the Asia-Pacific to
reaffirm U.S. engagement in the region and assert its leadership.
The trip, Clinton’s sixth to the region since taking office,
included stops in Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, China, New
Zealand and energy-rich Papua New Guinea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
