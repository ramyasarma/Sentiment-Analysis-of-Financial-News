Yemen LNG Co., partly owned by
France’s  Total SA , plans to increase liquefied natural gas
output by 30 percent next year, the managing director said.  The company plans to boost production to 6.55 million tons
in 2011 from 5 million tons this year,  Francois Rafin , who runs
Yemen LNG, the country’s largest industrial project, told
reporters today in Sana’a, the Yemeni capital.  The $4.5 billion facility, which is yet to reach its output
capacity of 6.7 million tons, delivered fewer cargoes to the
U.S. than initially planned because the price is higher in Asia,
Rafin said. The company diverted 35 out of 85 cargoes to the
Asian market in 2010, and will do the same in 2011, he said.  “We are trying to catch the better price by diverting to
Asia and this will improve the revenues of the Yemeni
government,” Rafin said.  Yemen, the poorest Arab country, has started to export its
natural gas as crude oil production, the source of 75 percent of
its income, declines. Oil output may drop to 260,000 barrels a
day this year from 440,000 barrels a day in 2001, according to
U.S. Energy Department data.  Yemen LNG delivered gas to 10 countries in 2010 and wants
to do the same in 2011, Rafin said. The reason behind the
diversion has nothing to do with security concerns of the U.S.
and is due to the low price of LNG in the U.S. market, he said.  Security has been heightened at airports across the world
after the discovery of air-freight bombs originating in Yemen
and bound for synagogues in Chicago.  Korean Talks  Yemen’s government is yet to reach an agreement with  Korea
Gas Corp.  to increase the price at which it buys the fuel, Rafin
said. Korea Gas has agreed to buy 2 million tons a year of LNG
from Yemen and owns 6 percent of Yemen LNG.  A delegation from Yemen LNG and the oil ministry was
expected to visit South Korea last month for talks, the Ministry
of Defense said on its website on Oct. 14. Yemeni President  Ali Abdullah Saleh  ordered a review of contracts signed between
Yemen LNG and its customers to try to bring them into line with
current prices, the official Saba news agency said on June 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
