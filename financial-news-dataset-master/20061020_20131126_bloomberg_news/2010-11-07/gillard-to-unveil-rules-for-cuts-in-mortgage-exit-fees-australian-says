Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard will unveil new banking rules this week that will force
most banks to cut exit fees charged on mortgages, the Australian
newspaper reported today, citing comments from
Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan.  The corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission, will enforce new rules banning unfair
conduct, the newspaper reported Gillard as saying.  The so-called big four banks, Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, Westpac Banking Corp., National Australia Bank Ltd.
and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., together
collect A$280 million ($284 million) a year in exit fees, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
