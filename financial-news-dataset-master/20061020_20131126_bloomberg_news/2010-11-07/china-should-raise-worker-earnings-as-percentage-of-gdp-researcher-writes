China should raise workers’ income as
a percentage of the country’s gross domestic product by
developing the services and other tertiary industries, Liu
Junsheng, a researcher with the Labor Wage Research Institute
under the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, wrote
in a commentary in the China Daily.  Worker pay in some labor-intensive industries such as
manufacturing and construction should also be boosted, Liu wrote
in the newspaper. The government should also cut fiscal revenue
and improve the “mechanism of wage growth,” Liu wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
