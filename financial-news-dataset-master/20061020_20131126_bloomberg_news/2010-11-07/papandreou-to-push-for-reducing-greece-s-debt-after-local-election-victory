Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  thanked Greeks for an initial victory in local
elections, saying his government would continue to press ahead
with its task of reducing a crippling budget deficit and debt
burden.  “Change is what the Greek people wanted when we were voted
into power a year ago,” Papandreou said in a statement
yesterday televised live on state-run NET TV. “Today the Greek
people reaffirmed they continue to want this change, to ask for
it. From tomorrow we continue our work, while remaining
absolutely committed to our great and common goals.”  Candidates backed by the socialist Pasok party will win
eight of 13 regional authorities, according to projections from
the Interior Ministry yesterday, in a vote that Papandreou has
called a test of support for his 13-month-old government after
it cut wages and pensions to secure a 110 billion-euro ($154.3
billion) rescue package from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund. Papandreou had said he might call
an early national election unless voters endorsed him in the
ballot.  The New Democracy party is ahead in the other five regions
in the first round of elections, according to Yannis Karakadas,
the chief of Singularlogic SA, which is running the vote count.
Three of the regions may change, he said. A run-off election
between candidates who don’t win a majority will be held Nov.
14. Socialists were ahead in three of the country’s five biggest
municipalities as well, according to projections.  60% Stay Home  Almost 10 million people were entitled to cast ballots to
elect officials for 325 Greek municipalities and 13 regions.
About 60 percent of the electorate abstained from voting,
according to official results so far.  “All of them are mocking us, telling lies,” Spyros
Varkatzoulis, 27, a construction worker in Athens, said on Nov.
6. “There’s no reason to vote for any of them.”  Most polls showed before yesterday’s countdown that Greeks
would vote against Pasok-backed candidates and the government’s
wage and pension cuts, designed to narrow a budget deficit equal
to almost 13.6 percent of gross domestic product. The size of
the shortfall was revealed after Papandreou won elections in
October 2009 on a promise of higher wages and increased state
spending.  Eight in 10 Greeks don’t want early elections, according to
a poll of 1,027 voters conducted by Public Issue from Nov. 4 to
Nov. 6 for Skai television and released yesterday.  The poll showed the same number of voters rejected
Papandreou’s appeal for support and that 65 percent considered
there were alternatives to the rescue package, compared with 59
percent in May when it was drafted. No exit polls were conducted
for the elections.  Bond Yields  The prospect of political upheaval has unnerved investors
again, just after Greece’s cost of borrowing had started to
decline. Yields on 10-year Greek bonds climbed above 11 percent
last week from a low of 8.77 percent on Oct. 13.  The  spread  against yields on German bunds of the same
maturity has widened 211 basis points since Papandreou raised
the possibility of early elections on Oct. 25. It had narrowed
to 649 basis points on Oct. 18 from a record 965 on May 7, five
days after the EU and IMF approved the bailout.  Elections would have derailed planning for a final budget
for 2011, which Papandreou said would mark the last year of
recession for Greece. EU and IMF officials are due in Athens
this month to review progress in cutting the deficit, the EU’s
second-largest as a percentage of gross domestic product, as a
prerequisite to releasing another installment of funds to the
country.  Priorities  “We have basic priorities ahead of us: to continue to put
public finances in order,” Papandreou said. “To reduce the
deficits drastically, cut debt while lowering spending and
changing the core of the public sector and public agencies. We
must stabilize our economy, which is a prerequisite for
returning to growth.”  Yiannis Dimaras, one of three lawmakers expelled from Pasok
after defying Papandreou in the May vote on terms of the
bailout, conceded defeat as he came in third in the race to head
a new regional authority for the greater Athens area, the
biggest in Greece.  Dimaras, 66, has campaigned under the slogan: “Memorandum
for the people,” a reference to the May agreement with the EU
and IMF. He said he will resign from parliament on Jan. 1,
allowing Papandreou to name a socialist party member in his
place and boosting the socialists’ majority in parliament to 158
in the 300-seat chamber.  To contact the reporters on this story:
