Amazon.com Inc.  is likely to announce
on Monday, Nov. 8, the purchase of Quidsi Inc., the parent
company of Diapers.com, for $540 million in cash, Fortune
reported, without citing anyone.  The offer values Diapers.com at $200 million more than in a
recent round of venture capital fund-raising, the magazine said
in a story published online late yesterday.  Amazon had previously bid for the company, Fortune said.
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  also had bid, the magazine said.  Quidsi’s shareholders include Accel Partners, Bessemer
Venture Partners, BEV Capital, MentorTech Ventures and New
Enterprise Associates, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
