Anglo American Plc  and  Xstrata Plc’s 
Collahuasi copper mine in northern Chile is operating
“normally” as a workers’ strike over pay entered its third
day, a spokeswoman said.  “Our contingency plan is working,” Bernardita Fernandez,
a spokeswoman for the mine, said in a telephone interview today.
Collahuasi, the world’s fourth-largest copper mine, is using
non-union employees and contract workers, she said.  No negotiations have taken place since management and the
workers’ union failed to agree on a new wage contract on Nov. 4,
Fernandez said. The union called on Chilean Mining Minister
 Laurence Golborne  to intervene in the matter, according to a
posting on its website yesterday.  The strike at Collahuasi, which accounted for 3.5 percent
of the world’s mined copper output last year, helped drive
copper on the London Metal Exchange to a 28-month high last week
on concern it will exacerbate shortages of the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
