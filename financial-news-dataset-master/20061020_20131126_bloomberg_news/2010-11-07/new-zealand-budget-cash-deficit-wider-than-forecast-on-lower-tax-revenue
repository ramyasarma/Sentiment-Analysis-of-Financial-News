New Zealand’s budget cash deficit
was wider than the government forecast as lower-than-expected
spending curbed sales tax receipts.  The cash deficit totaled NZ$6.45 billion ($5.1 billion) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, or NZ$885 million more than
forecast in May’s budget, the Treasury Department said in a
statement released in Wellington today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
