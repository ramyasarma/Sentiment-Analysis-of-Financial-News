Nomura Holdings Inc. is looking for a
U.S. acquisition, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview with Chief Operating Officer Takumi Shibata. The
Japanese brokerage had recently considered Jefferies, among
other possible targets, the report said, citing two people
familiar with the matter. Nomura isn’t planning to raise capital
to finance an acquisition, Shibata said, according to the
report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
