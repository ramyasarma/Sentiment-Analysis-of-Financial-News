Saudi Arabia’s government-owned
Public Investment Fund has invested $100 million in a subsidiary
owned by the International Finance Corp., the private-sector arm
of the World Bank, which will invest in Africa and Latin
America, an executive at the corporation said.  Rashad Kaldany , IFC’s vice president for Asia, Eastern
Europe, Middle East and North Africa, said the PIF had put the
money in the African, Latin American and Caribbean Fund, which
was launched in April and has investment commitments totaling
$950 million as of June 30. He was speaking in an interview in
Riyadh on Nov. 3.  As of June 30, ALAC had invested $66 million in its first
three transactions, according to the IFC.  Other investors in the ALAC fund include the Dutch pension
fund manager PGGM, the Korea Investment Corporation, the State
Oil Fund of Azerbaijan and the United Nations’ Joint Staff
Pension Fund.  The IFC invested $2.2 billion in Africa last year and it
plans to increase its investment in its 2011 fiscal year, Chief
Executive Officer  Lars Thunell  said in an interview at the World
Economic Forum in Marrakesh, Morocco on Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
