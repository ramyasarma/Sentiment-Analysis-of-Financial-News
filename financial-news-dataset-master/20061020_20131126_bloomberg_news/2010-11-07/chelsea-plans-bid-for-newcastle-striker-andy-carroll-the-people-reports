Premier League soccer champion
Chelsea wants to sign Newcastle striker Andy Carroll as a long-
term replacement for Didier Drogba, The People reported, without
citing anyone.  Chelsea may make a 20 million-pound ($32.4 million) bid for
the 21-year-old in January’s so-called transfer window, or wait
until the end of the season, the newspaper said today.  Newcastle is aware of Chelsea’s interest and will attempt
to keep hold of Carroll, who has signed a new five-year
contract, The People reported.  The 32-year-old Drogba was Chelsea’s top-scorer last season
with 37 goals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
