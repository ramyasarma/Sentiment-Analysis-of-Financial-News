Candidates backed by the ruling Pasok
party were leading the vote in eight of thirteen regional
authorities in Greece’s first round of local elections,
according to a Greek interior ministry official.  Candidates backed by the main opposition New Democracy
party were leading in the other five regions, the official said,
who spoke live on state-run NET TV. In three regions the race is
too close to safely predict which of the contenders would remain
ahead, the official said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
