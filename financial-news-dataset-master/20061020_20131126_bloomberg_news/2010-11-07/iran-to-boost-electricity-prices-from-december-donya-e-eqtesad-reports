Iran will start increasing
electricity rates from December as part of a wider plan to phase
out subsidies of prices for energy and food,  Donya-e-Eqtesad 
reported, citing an unidentified Energy Ministry official.  The official confirmed that Iranians will start receiving
electricity bills with revised rates beginning next month,
according to the Tehran-based newspaper. The new prices are not
yet final, it reported.  Iran’s government plans to eliminate subsidies on fuel,
electricity and basic consumer goods over five years, starting
in 2010. The government has said it will pay grants every two
months to compensate poor families for the plan’s inflationary
effects.  Iranian officials have not announced when utilities and
food prices will be increased or by how much.  To contact the reporter on this story:
