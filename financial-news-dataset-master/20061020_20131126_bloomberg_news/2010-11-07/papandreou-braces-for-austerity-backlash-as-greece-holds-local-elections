A majority of Greeks believes Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  shouldn’t call early elections and
there are alternatives to measures agreed in exchange for
emergency loans to get the country’s economy back on course.  Eighty-one percent of 1,027 people surveyed from Nov. 4 to
Nov. 6 said “there’s no need” for general elections and 16
percent said there is, according to a nationwide Public Issue
Poll for  Skai media  group released today.  Papandreou raised the possibility of early elections in
comments televised live on state-run NET and six other
television stations on Oct. 25.  The 13-month-old socialist Pasok government has raised
taxes, trimmed spending and cut wages and pensions in exchange
for 110 billion euros ($154.4 billion) in emergency loans from
the European Union and International Monetary Fund.  Sixty-five percent of respondents said the EU-IMF
arrangement isn’t the only way to solve the country’s economic
troubles, up from 59 percent in a poll conducted in May.  Almost 60 percent of those surveyed said they expect a
“big” or “very big” abstention in local elections, which
feature a first round today and a second phase of voting in a
week’s time. Almost 10 million people are entitled to vote for
officials in 325 municipalities and 13 regions.  The poll had a 3.2 percentage-point margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
