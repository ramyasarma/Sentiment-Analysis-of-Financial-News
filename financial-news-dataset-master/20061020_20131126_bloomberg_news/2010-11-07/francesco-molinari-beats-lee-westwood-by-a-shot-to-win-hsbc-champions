Italy’s Francesco Molinari won golf’s
HSBC Champions tournament by one shot today over new world No. 1
Lee Westwood.       Molinari clinched his second European Tour title after
scoring 67 in his final two rounds in Shanghai, a feat matched
by the Englishman. The winner ended on 19-under par. England’s
Luke Donald and Richie Ramsay of Scotland were joint third, 10
shots behind the winner.  “We were just really watching each other and it was really
trying to birdie every hole, because we were both playing well
and pars weren’t going to be good enough,” Molinari told
reporters after his tussle with Ryder Cup teammate Westwood, who
displaced Tiger Woods as No. 1 a week ago.  Molinari collected a check for 860,000 euros ($1.2
million).   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
