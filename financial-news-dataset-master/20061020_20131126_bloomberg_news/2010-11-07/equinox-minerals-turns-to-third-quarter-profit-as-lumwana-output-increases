  Equinox Minerals Ltd ., the Australian
copper producer that agreed to buy Citadel Resource Group,
turned to profit in the third quarter as production at its
Lumwana mine in Zambia increased.  Net income was $71.2 million for the three months ending
Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $56.3 million a year ago, the
Perth-based company said today in a statement.  The $841 million Lumwana mine produced 38,445 metric tons
of copper at a cost of $1.21 a pound, reaching design capacity
after starting operation in 2008, Equinox said. The mine is
forecast to produce 140,000 metric tons of copper concentrate
this year.  Global copper demand probably will outpace supply by
180,000 metric tons this year, with the deficit widening to
482,000 tons next year,  Michael Jansen , an analyst at JPMorgan
Securities Ltd. in  London , said Oct. 21.  Equinox rose 0.2 percent to A$6.35 at the 4:10 p.m. Sydney
time close on the Australian stock exchange, taking this year’s
gains to 46 percent.  The company agreed to pay A$1.3 billion ($1.3 billion),
based on Nov. 5 closing prices, in cash and shares for
Melbourne-based Citadel Resources last month, putting it on
target to produce 260,000 tons of copper a year within four
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
