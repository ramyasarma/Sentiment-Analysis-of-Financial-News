Tropical storm Jal is forecast to
strike southeastern India tonight, threatening floods and damage
from winds gusting as high as 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour.  The second cyclonic storm of the northeast monsoon was
centered about 325 kilometers southeast of the city of Chennai,
formerly known as Madras, as of 11:15 am local time, according
to storm data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jal, which means water in Hindi, will bring thunderstorms
with sustained winds of 60-70 kilometers per hour, and may cause
flooding from a sea surge as high as 2 meters (6.6 feet), the
Indian Meteorological Department  said  today in a release on its
website.  Heavy rainfall is expected during the next 48 hours in the
coastal provinces of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, the agency
said.  Fishermen should not venture out to sea during this period
and coastal hut dwellers should move inland, the statement
warned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
