Deyaar Development,  the property
company part-owned by  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC , fell to the
lowest intraday level in more than a week after it posted a loss
of 145 million dirhams ($39 million) in the third quarter.  The shares slumped 4.8 percent to 31.8 fils, the lowest
since Oct. 27, at 12:25 p.m. in Dubai.  Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 was 63.45
million dirhams, the company said. Deyaar remains “committed to
its consolidation and project completion strategy, including the
handover of five projects in the Business Bay areas in 2010,”
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
