The euro fell against the dollar and
the yen as waning demand for Irish bonds and the difficulties
facing the Greek government reduced the appetite for the
region’s assets.  The euro dropped to $1.3985 as of 10:58 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.4032 in New York last week. The 16-nation currency declined
to 113.78 yen from 114.03 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
