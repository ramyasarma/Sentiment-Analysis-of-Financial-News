Qantas Airways Ltd.  extended the
grounding of its Airbus SAS A380 fleet to a week as it continues
inspections of Rolls-Royce Group Plc engines following a mid-
flight explosion.  The planes won’t fly for at least another 72 hours as
engineers probe potential oil leaks found in three engines,
Chief Executive Officer  Alan Joyce  told reporters in Sydney
today. The carrier expects to clear a passenger backlog and
resume normal services by tomorrow as it uses other planes and
chartered aircraft to offset the loss of the six A380s, he said.  Qantas fell the most in almost a month in Sydney trading as
it works to reassure travelers following the A380 incident on
Nov. 4 and a separate Boeing Co. 747 engine failure a day later.
Joyce said it was too early to estimate the cost of the
disruptions caused by the loss of the  450-seat A380s , which
represent about 17 percent of Qantas’s international capacity.  “We are not going to take any risks whatsoever,” Joyce
said. “We will not be operating the fleet until we are sure we
can ensure safety.”  The Sydney-based carrier grounded the four-engine A380s
after the Nov. 4 blowout forced an emergency landing in
Singapore. The Boeing 747 landed in the city-state a day later
after the failure of one its engines, which were also made by
London-based Rolls-Royce. The airline has said the incidents
were unrelated.  Qantas  fell 2.1 percent to A$2.80 at the 4:10 p.m. market
close in Sydney, the largest decline in almost a month. The
stock has fallen 6.4 percent this year, compared with a 1.9
percent drop in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  A380 Passengers  The airline is putting stranded A380 passengers, including
500 people in Los Angeles, in hotels and providing meals and
international telephone calls. It is continuing checks to “rule
out other potential issues” with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900
engines, while focusing on the potential leaks, it said in a
 statement .  “These are new engines on a new aircraft type and they’re
not performing to the parameters you expect,” Joyce said.  The incident won’t affect Qantas’ plans to use  Rolls-Royce 
engines on the 14 other A380s it has on order, he said. The
carrier is due to receive its seventh superjumbo by year-end, he
said.  In addition to the damaged A380 in Singapore, Qantas has
three Airbus double-deckers in Los Angeles, one in Sydney and a
sixth aircraft in Germany that was undergoing regular
maintenance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
