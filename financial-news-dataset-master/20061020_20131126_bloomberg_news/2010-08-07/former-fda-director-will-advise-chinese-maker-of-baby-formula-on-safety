             Guangdong Yashili Group Co., a
Chinese maker of infant formula, named a former director at the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration as head of an advisory
committee on quality and safety.  
 Robert Brackett  will chair the six-person committee,
Chaozhou, China-based Yashili said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “The issues surrounding the quality of infant formula
products will be a growing concern for Chinese consumers,”
Brackett said in the statement.  
 Melamine-tainted milk powder sold in China sickened
thousands of children in 2008, was linked to at least six deaths
and prompted government tests that found the products of more
than 20 dairy companies contained the chemical. Melamine is a
chemical used in the production of plastics that can also be
used to make protein levels in watered-down milk appear higher.  
 Carlyle Group of the U.S. and Fosun Group have invested in
Yashili.
