             ZAO IFD Kapital, owned by  OAO Lukoil (LKOH) 
executives Vagit Alekperov and  Leonid Fedun , gained antitrust
approval to bid for shares in OAO TGK-8, the Rostov-based power
generator.  
 IFD Kapital got approval to buy as much as 100 percent of
TGK-8's shares, Yelena Nagaichuk, a spokeswoman for the
competition watchdog, said by telephone today.  
 OAO Unified Energy System, the national power utility, may
hold an auction for TGK-8's shares this month or in early
October, Dmitry Akhanov, Unified Energy's head of strategy, said
last month.
