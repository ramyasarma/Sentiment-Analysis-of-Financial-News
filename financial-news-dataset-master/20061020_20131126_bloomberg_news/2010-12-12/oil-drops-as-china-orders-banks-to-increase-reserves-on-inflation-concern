Oil dropped for a second day after
OPEC kept production targets unchanged and China’s inflation
accelerated, fueling speculation it will take further steps to
cool the economy.  Futures extended last week’s 1.6 percent decline after the
Organization of petroleum Exporting Countries maintained its
output quotas, forecasting demand growth will slow as the
economy struggles to recover, amid ample supplies. A statistics
bureau report Dec. 11 showed China’s consumer prices jumped 5.1
percent in November, the most in 28 months.  The January contract dropped as much as 25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $87.54 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $87.60 a barrel at 7:31 a.m.
Singapore time. The contract closed Dec. 10 at $87.79, the
lowest in seven days, capping the first weekly decline in three
weeks.  Oil supply and demand are “in balance,” and $70 to $80 is
“a good price” for oil, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-
Naimi said at the group’s meeting in Quito, Ecuador on Dec. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
