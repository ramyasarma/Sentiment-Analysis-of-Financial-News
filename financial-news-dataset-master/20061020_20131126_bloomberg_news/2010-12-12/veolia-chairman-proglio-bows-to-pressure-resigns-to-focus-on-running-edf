Henri Proglio , the top executive at
France’s biggest water and nuclear power companies, stepped down
as chairman of  Veolia Environnement SA , bowing to pressure to
relinquish one of his two jobs.  Chief Executive Officer  Antoine Frerot  will become
chairman, Veolia said in an e-mailed statement today.  Proglio, 61, was criticized by French politicians and
corporate governance experts such as  Daniel Lebegue , who heads
the French Institute of Directors, for the conflicts of interest
that might arise from his dual role as chief executive of state-
controlled Electricite de France SA and chairman of Veolia. The
water utility, where Proglio spent most of his career, said in
March he would step down from the chairmanship before the end of
the year. He will remain a director.  Proglio said in January he would renounce a salary of
450,000 euros as chairman of  Veolia , which would have come on
top of his pay at EDF. He took the top post at the state-
controlled power producer in November 2009. Until moving to EDF,
Proglio was chairman and chief executive of Veolia.  He ran Veolia with “determination, energy and passion,”
the Paris-based company said in the statement.  EDF and Veolia, both included in France’s benchmark  CAC40 
stock index, have embarked on asset-disposal programs since
expansion drove up debt. EDF has a market capitalization of 59.1
billion euros, while Veolia is valued at 10.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
