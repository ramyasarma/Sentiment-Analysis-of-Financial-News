German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said that he expects a Dec. 16-17 European Union
summit will agree to establish a permanent crisis-resolution
mechanism for indebted euro-area countries.  EU leaders will back the limited treaty changes needed to
allow the mechanism to be set up from 2013 to stabilize the
euro, Schaeuble said in an interview today on  ARD television  in
Berlin.  He reiterated Germany’s opposition to joint euro-area
bonds, as proposed last week by Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean- Claude Juncker , who chairs the group of euro-region finance
ministers.  “As long as we don’t have a common budgetary policy -- and
that was a decision made when setting up the euro -- then we
need to have different interest rates” payable on government
bonds, Schaeuble said. “Because that’s the only way to bring
member states round to sound policy. That can’t be abandoned.”  Rather, euro-area countries should follow the example set
by Germany in reining in bloated budget deficits, Schaeuble
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
