The New York Giants, forced to spend
the night in Kansas City when a storm closed the Minneapolis
airport, will rise early tomorrow to catch a charter flight for
their game against the Minnesota Vikings.  The team’s flight was diverted to Missouri yesterday when
the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport was closed
because of heavy snow and high winds. One runway was opened in
the late afternoon although most flights already had been
canceled.  The plan is for the players to get up at 6 a.m. Central
time, and take off at 8 a.m. to arrive in Minnesota an hour
later in time for the noon kickoff of the National Football
League match-up, Giants spokesman  Pat Hanlon  said on Twitter.  “While we had a runway open, they chose not to come in
tonight,” said Melissa Scovronski, a spokeswoman for the
airport, in an e-mail.  Minneapolis-St. Paul is expecting a sunny day tomorrow with
a high of 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-15 Centigrade), according
to the National Weather Service. Blustery winds with gusts as
high as 28 miles per hour (45 kph) will drive the wind chill
values as low as minus-29.  The Vikings (5-7) play at Mall of America Field, which is
covered by 10 acres of Teflon-coated fiberglass held up by 20
electric fans.  The Giants (8-4) are tied with the Philadelphia Eagles atop
the National Football Conference East division. The Vikings are
in third place in the four-team NFC North.  To contact the reporter on this story:
