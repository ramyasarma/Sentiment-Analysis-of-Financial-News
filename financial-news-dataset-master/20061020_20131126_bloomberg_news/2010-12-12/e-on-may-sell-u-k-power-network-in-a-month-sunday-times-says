E.ON AG  may sell Britain’s largest
electricity distributor, E.ON Central Networks, within a month
after it granted a group of foreign bidders exclusive rights to
make an offer, the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying where
it got its information.  E.ON has given the group, including the Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board until mid January to put together a bid for the network,
the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
