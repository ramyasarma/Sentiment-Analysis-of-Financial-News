Hong Kong police are investigating
whether Global Merchant Funding, a company that provides loans
to retail businesses, is acting as an unlicensed moneylender,
the South China Morning Post reported.  The company gives businesses money and is paid back with a
percentage of daily credit-card sales, according to the report.
Global Merchant can charge more than the equivalent of a 60
percent annual interest rate on a loan, the interest-rate limit
in Hong Kong, the Morning Post said, citing analysis of figures
found in documents Global Merchant has shown to potential
customers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
