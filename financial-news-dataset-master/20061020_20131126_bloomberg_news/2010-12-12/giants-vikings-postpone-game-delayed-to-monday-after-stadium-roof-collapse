The National Football League game
between the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants has been
postponed after it was rescheduled to tomorrow following a
snowstorm, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.  The newspaper said no decision had been made as of this
morning on when and where the game will be played after the roof
of the Minneapolis Metrodome partially collapsed overnight.  The game was originally set to have been played starting at
noon today before more than a foot of snow fell in the Twin
Cities.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
