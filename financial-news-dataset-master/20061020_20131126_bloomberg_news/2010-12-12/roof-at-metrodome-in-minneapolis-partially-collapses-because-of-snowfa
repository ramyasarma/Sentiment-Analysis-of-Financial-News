The roof of the Minneapolis
Metrodome, home to the National Football League’s Minnesota
Vikings, partially collapsed overnight after more than a foot of
snow fell in the Twin Cities, a stadium official said.  “There was damage to three panels on the roof,” said Bill
Lester, head of the commission that oversees the stadium, which
has an inflatable roof.  He said a decision had yet to be made on the status of the
Vikings-New York Giants NFL game. It had been postponed before
the roof incident to tomorrow night from noon today due to the
weather.  The Minneapolis area received more than 12 inches (30
centimeters) of snow yesterday and had sustained winds of as
much as 25 miles per hour with gusts of 40 mph, AccuWeather
meteorologist Tom Kines said in an interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
