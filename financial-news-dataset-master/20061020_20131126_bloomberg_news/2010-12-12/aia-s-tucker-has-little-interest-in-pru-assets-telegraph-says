AIA Group Ltd., American
International Group Inc.’s Asian division, has “little
interest” in bidding for Prudential Plc’s East Asian assets, the
Sunday Telegraph reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Mark
Tucker.  “We’ve closed that chapter in our lives,” Tucker said in
an interview with the newspaper. “We have our own destiny in
our hands and we have to deliver on that.”  AIA will focus on organic growth opportunities, Tucker told
the Telegraph, with the ability to make tactical mergers and
acquisitions.  Tucker will split his role of CEO and Chairman, appointing
a new non-executive chairman in 2011, according to the
newspaper.  -- Editor: Chris Peterson  To contact the reporters on this story:
