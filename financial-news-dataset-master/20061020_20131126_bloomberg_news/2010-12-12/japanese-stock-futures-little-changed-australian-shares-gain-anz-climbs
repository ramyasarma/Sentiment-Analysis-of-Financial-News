Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed as the yen weakened, improving the outlook for Japanese
companies’ export earnings, while there were indications the
market is overheated. Australian stocks advanced.  American depositary receipts of Trend Micro Inc., the
world’s third-biggest maker of security software and which gets
27 percent of its revenue from North America, increased 0.5
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of
Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s No. 1 commodities trader, dropped 0.4
percent. Shares of Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
Australia’s third-largest bank by market value, climbed 0.6
percent in Sydney today.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 10,200 in Chicago on Dec. 10, compared with
10,220 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,220
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index rose 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
increased 0.5 percent in Wellington.  The 25-day Toraku index, a measure of daily stock winners
and losers on the Topix, was 151 on Dec. 10. A level of more
than 120 suggests to some investors the market is poised to fall.  “The market will likely be strong,” following economic
reports from the U.S. and the dollar’s appreciation, said
 Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Co. “However, the market may take a
breather because of short-term overheating.”  U.S. Consumer Sentiment  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. In New York, the index gained 0.6 percent to
1,240.40 on Dec. 10 after General Electric Co. boosted its
dividend and reports on consumer confidence and the trade
deficit beat forecasts.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer U.S. sentiment rose to 74.2 in December from
71.6 at the end of November. Economists projected a December
reading of 72.5, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  A Commerce Department report showed the U.S. trade deficit
shrank to $38.7 billion in October, less than the lowest
estimate of 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the
smallest since January.  China ordered lenders to park more money with the central
bank for the third time in five weeks to counter the threat from
inflation after November’s lending and trade surplus topped
analysts’ estimates. Reserve requirements will increase 50 basis
points starting Dec. 20, the People’s Bank of China said on its
website on Dec. 10.  Yen Weakens  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has increased 10 percent
through Dec. 10 in 2010, compared with gains of 11 percent by
the S&P 500 and 8.8 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.7 times estimated
 earnings  on average, compared with 14.5 times for the S&P 500
and 12.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to 84.03 against the dollar, compared
with 83.67 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo on Dec. 10. A
weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency. Against the
euro, the yen weakened to 111.04 from 110.86.  To contact the reporters for this story:
