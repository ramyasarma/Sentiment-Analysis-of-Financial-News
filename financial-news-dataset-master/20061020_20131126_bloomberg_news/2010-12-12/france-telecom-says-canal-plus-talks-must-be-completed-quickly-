France Telecom SA Chief Executive
Stephane Richard said talks to find a partner for its Orange
Cinema Series TV channel need to be concluded soon.  France Telecom is reviewing options for the channel that
could lead to its merger with Vivendi SA’s Canal Plus unit.  “Canal Plus does movie series, they’re quite good,”
Richard said today on RTL radio. “The deal hasn’t been
concluded. I want to be transparent -- there are other offers on
the table,” though a decision should be reached “quickly now.
We have to wrap up this process.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
