Navy defeated Army 31-17 to extend
its winning streak in the series to nine, the longest in the
history of the teams’ 111-game rivalry.  Ricky Dobbs passed for 185 yards and two touchdowns for the
Midshipmen, who improved their record against the Black Knights
(6-6) to 55-49-7 in the college football game at Lincoln
Financial Field in Philadelphia.  Dobbs also lost the ball four times, fumbling three times
and throwing one interception for Navy (9-3).  Trent Steelman threw for 128 yards and two touchdowns for
Army. His fumble late in the first half was converted into a 98-
yard scoring run by Wyatt Middleton to put Navy ahead 24-7 at
halftime.  Navy will play San Diego State in the Poinsettia Bowl at
Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego on Dec. 23. Army, playing in its
first bowl game since 1996, will meet Southern Methodist
University in the Armed Forces Bowl at Gerald J. Ford Stadium in
Dallas on Dec. 30.  The Navy-Army rivalry dates back to November 1890, when the
two first played each other at West Point. The game was moved to
Philadelphia in 1899, where most of the games have been played.  To contact the reporter on this story:
