Corn may rise for a fourth straight
week and soybeans may rebound on speculation that demand for
U.S. supplies will increase as adverse global weather damages
crops in other countries.  Twenty-one of 33 traders and analysts surveyed from Chicago
to Tokyo on Dec. 10 said corn will rise, and 20 respondents said
soybeans will gain. Last week, corn futures for March delivery
climbed 0.1 percent to $5.7425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, and soybean futures for January delivery declined 2.1
percent to $12.73 a bushel, snapping a two-week rally.  Last week’s gain in corn was expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on Dec. 3, while the drop in soybeans was a
surprise. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 52 percent
of the time for corn and 54 percent for soybeans.  Bullish  on corn: 21   Bullish  on soybeans: 20
