U.K. fighter Amir Khan said he’s
dispelled doubts about his ability to take big punches after a
hard-fought points win over Marcos Maidana to retain his World
Boxing Association lightwelterweight title.  Khan, 24, came under sustained spells of pressure from the
Argentine, particularly in the 10th round, before taking a
unanimous verdict in Las Vegas last night.  He’d faced question marks over his susceptibility to
powerful blows after a first-round knockout against Colombia’s
Breidis Prescott in September 2008.  “A lot of people say ‘Amir has no chin,’ but I proved I
have,” Khan was cited as saying by the  British Broadcasting
Corp  after the 12-round contest. “Everyone knows Maidana is a
big hitter but I went in there and was hit by the best shots and
came back stronger.”  Khan floored his opponent in the first round, but Maidana
recovered to give the Briton one of the biggest tests of his
career.  “I have to say Maidana’s a warrior, he never took a step
back and it shows that I’ve got a lion’s heart,” said Khan, who
went for a precautionary scan after the fight. “At times I was
hurt, but I had to dig deeper and that’s boxing for you.”  Khan has said he hopes to fight Floyd Mayweather of the
U.S. next year, and the Briton’s trainer Freddie Roach told the
BBC that the matchup is a possibility.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
