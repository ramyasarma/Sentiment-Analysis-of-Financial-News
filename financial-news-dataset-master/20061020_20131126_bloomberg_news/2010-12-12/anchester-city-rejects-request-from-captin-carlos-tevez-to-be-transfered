Manchester City rejected a transfer
request from captain Carlos Tevez.  “The club remains disappointed by this situation and
particularly with the actions of Carlos’ representative,” the
Premier League team said today on its website. Tevez is the
club’s highest paid player, and still has 3 1/2 years on his
contract, City said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
