Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
backed police actions to disperse violent rallies held by
nationalist football fans in Moscow and St. Petersburg
yesterday, according to a  statement  posted on the Kremlin
website.  A rally of 5,500-people in central Moscow in memory of
Spartak football club fan Yegor Sviridov, who was shot dead in a
clash with migrants from Northern Caucasus on Dec. 6, turned
violent yesterday, with 32 people injured and 66 arrested,
according to Interfax news service. Interior Minister Rashid
Nurgaliyev blamed the clashes on nationalist groups in comments
carried by state television.  Russia’s law enforcement have the right to use all the
means permitted by law to prevent such incidents, Medvedev said.
A smaller rally was held yesterday in St.Petersburg, Russia’s
second-biggest city.  Moscow city police Chief Vladimir Kolokoltsev told the
protesters yesterday the investigation into Sviridov’s death
will be carried out properly. Seven people remained in hospital
today, including two whose condition was grave, after attacks
targeted at people from the Northern Caucasus, according to
