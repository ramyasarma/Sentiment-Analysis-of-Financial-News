The French state must take the lead
on belt tightening as the government seeks to reduce its
deficit, Budget Minister  Francois Baroin  said, according to an
interview published in  Le Journal du Dimanche .  “It’s important that the state begins to set the
example,” Baroin was quoted as saying in the weekly newspaper.  Baroin meets tomorrow with the heads of France’s 497
governmental organizations, which range from  Meteo France  to the
Louvre museum. From now on the organizations will have to
implement policies the government itself is already following,
such replacing only one in two employees who retire, cutting
their car fleets, and reducing spending on offices and
furniture, Baroin told the newspaper.  Baroin also said he aims to crack down on tax evasion and
the abuse of social benefits. As much as 7 billion euros ($9.3
billion) in capital is now domiciled in France instead of tax
havens since the government stepped up its campaign to pursue
evaders, the newspaper cited Baroin as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
