Istithmar World PJSC, the private
equity company owned by Dubai World, has yet to sign an
agreement to sell the  Victoria & Alfred Waterfront  shopping mall
in Cape Town, South Africa, an official at Dubai World said.  Johannesburg-based Mail & Guardian newspaper reported  Absa
Group Ltd.,  Growthpoint Properties Ltd. and the Public
Investment Corp. have together signed an accord to purchase
South Africa’s biggest tourist destination on Dec. 10 for 10
billion rand ($1.46 billion). The deal would be completed on
Dec. 13, the newspaper said, citing people it didn’t identify.
Bronwen Noble, a Growthpoint spokeswoman, denied the company was
involved in the deal, the newspaper reported on Dec. 10.  The report is not true, the Dubai World official said.
Istithmar has been discussing the sale of the V&A Mall with some
companies, the official said, declining to be identified because
the information is private. A spokeswoman for Dubai World
declined to comment.  Istithmar World bought the shopping mall in 2006 for $1
billion together with London & Regional Properties.  Dubai World, one of the emirate’s three state-owned holding
companies, is altering the terms on $24.9 billion of debt as it
restructures business after the global credit crisis. Istithmar
World is not part of the restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
