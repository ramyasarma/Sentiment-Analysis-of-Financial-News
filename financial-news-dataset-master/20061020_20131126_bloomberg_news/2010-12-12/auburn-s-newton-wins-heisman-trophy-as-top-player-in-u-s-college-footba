Quarterback  Cam Newton  won the
Heisman Trophy as college football’s best player after leading
undefeated Auburn University to a spot in the national
championship game while facing a probe into recruiting
violations.  Newton received 2,263 points, beating Stanford University
quarterback Andrew Luck (1,079) by 184 points. University of
Oregon running back LaMichael James (916) finished third and
Boise State quarterback Kellen Moore (635) was fourth.  “It’s something every child has a dream of who plays the
sport of football,” Newton said. “I’m living testimony that
anything is possible.”  Newton, a 21-year-old junior, accounted for 49 touchdowns
for the 13-0 Tigers this season. He becomes the third Auburn
player to win the  Heisman  in the award’s  76-year history ,
following quarterback Pat Sullivan in 1971 and running back Bo
Jackson in 1985.  Newton received 729 first-place votes among the 886 ballots
that were returned. His name didn’t appear on 105 ballots. Luck
received 78 first-place votes.  O.J. Simpson had the  biggest win  in Heisman history in 1968,
when the University of Southern California running back received
855 first-place votes and 2,853 points. Runner-up Purdue’s Leroy
Keyes was first on 49 ballots and had 1,103 points. Ohio State
quarterback  Troy Smith  had the  second-biggest  Heisman victory in
2006, when he finished with 801 first-place votes and 2,540
points.  Alabama running back  Mark Ingram  beat Stanford’s  Toby Gerhart  by 28 points last year in the award’s closest race.  National Championship  In his first season at  Auburn  after winning a junior
college title in Texas, Newton put the school in position to
claim its first national championship since 1957.  Newton, who’s 6-foot-6 and 250 pounds, completed 67 percent
of his passes for 2,589 yards and 28 touchdowns, with six
interceptions. He also ran for a team-leading 1,580 yards and
his 20 rushing touchdowns broke the school record that had been
shared by Jackson and Carnell “Cadillac” Williams. James
finished with 22 rushing scores for  Oregon  this year, tied for
the most at college football’s highest level.  Newton preserved Auburn’s undefeated season on Nov. 26 by
rallying the Tigers from a 24-point deficit to beat defending
national champion Alabama 28-27 on the road. He threw for three
touchdowns and also ran for a score.  Less than a week later, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association cleared Newton to play and ended questions about his
eligibility after ruling he wasn’t aware of a pay-for-play
demand organized by his father.  NCAA Investigation  Newton selected Auburn over Southeastern Conference-rival
Mississippi State. A former Mississippi State player, acting as
a representative of Newton’s father, requested payments totaling
$180,000 from the school to get the quarterback to play for the
Bulldogs,  ESPN reported .  Newton was a backup to former Heisman winner  Tim Tebow  at
the  University of Florida  in 2007 and 2008 before transferring
to  Blinn College  and winning a championship last year.  Newton wouldn’t comment last month on a  Fox Sports report 
that he faced potential expulsion at Florida for three instances
of academic cheating. Teammates, coaches and Auburn officials
backed Newton, with Athletic Director Jay Jacobs saying that the
allegations were intended to tear down their star quarterback’s
reputation.  SEC Title  The accusations surrounding Newton emerged less than two
months after ex-USC running back  Reggie Bush  became the first
Heisman winner to relinquish or be stripped of the award. Bush
forfeited the trophy after the NCAA said he was ineligible to
play in 2005 because of rule violations.  Amid the off-field scrutiny, Newton led Auburn to a perfect
regular season that was capped by a 56-17 rout of the University
of South Carolina in the Southeastern Conference championship
game. Newton solidified his status as the Heisman Trophy
favorite in that game by throwing for a career-high 335 yards
and four touchdowns while running for two more scores.  Newton will seek to follow Ingram as the second straight
Heisman recipient to win a championship when Auburn faces Oregon
for the national title on Jan. 10 in Glendale, Arizona.  Teams with the Heisman winner are 2-6 in the Bowl
Championship Series title game since its inception in 1998.  The trophy is named in memory of former football coach John
Heisman, who as director of New York’s Downtown Athletic Club
helped create the award in 1935. Heisman died less than a year
later from pneumonia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
