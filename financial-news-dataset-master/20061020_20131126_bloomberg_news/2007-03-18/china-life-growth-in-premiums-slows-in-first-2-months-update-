             China Life Insurance Co., the
nation's biggest life insurer, reported growth in premiums slowed
to 13 percent in the first two months of the year.  
 China Life posted premium income of 43 billion  yuan  ($5.6
billion) in the two months ended February 28, it said in a
statement to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  today. That compares
with 37.9 billion yuan a year earlier and growth of 38 percent.  
 Hong Kong-traded shares of the Beijing-based insurer rose
0.7 percent to close at HK$21 on March 16. Its yuan-currency
shares jumped 4.1 percent to close at 33.81 yuan.  
 Insurance premiums in China rose 14 percent last year to 564
billion yuan as economic growth spurred sales of investment and
protection products.
