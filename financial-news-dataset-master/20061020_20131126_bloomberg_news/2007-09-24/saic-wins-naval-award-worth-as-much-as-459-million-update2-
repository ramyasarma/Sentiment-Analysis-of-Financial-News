             SAIC Inc. (SAI) , the defense company that
first sold shares to the public in October, won a contract with
a potential value of more than $459 million from the Space and
Naval Warfare Systems Center in Charleston, South Carolina.  
 The contract is for one year with nine one-year options,
SAIC said today in a statement. The work will be done by the
company's Eagan, McAllister Associates subsidiary and consists
of providing tactical command-and-control integration services.

meaning the company isn't guaranteed the maximum amount.  
 SAIC will provide tactical command and control integration
services for the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center. The
work will mainly serve command-and-control and intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance activities, the company said.
Work under the contract will be performed in Charleston,
Lexington Park,  Maryland  and Norfolk, Virginia.
