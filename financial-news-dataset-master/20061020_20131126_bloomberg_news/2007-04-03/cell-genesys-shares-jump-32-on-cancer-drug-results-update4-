             Cell Genesys Inc.'s shares climbed
32 percent after updated test results showed its experimental
drug for prostate cancer improved survival better than previously
indicated.  
 The  stock  jumped $1.39 to $5.70 at 4:00 p.m.  New York  time
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading after earlier climbing
41 percent to $6.06.  
 The experimental treatment GVAX increased survival to 35
months rather than 26.2 months, the South San Francisco,
 California , company said today in a statement. Patients survived
18.9 months when given the standard treatment, Cell Genesys said.
The company has no products on the market.  
 ``We continue to hope that GVAX immunotherapy for prostate
cancer may some day offer a new treatment option for patients
with this disease,'' said Rob Bow, the chief medical officer of
the company in the statement.  
 The stock surged 20 percent March 30 after a U.S. advisory
committee recommended approval of a prostate-cancer treatment
from  Dendreon Corp. (DNDN)  If approved, the Dendreon product would be
the first to stimulate the body's immune system against tumor
cells. The Cell Genesys drug also stimulates the immune system.  
 The company has accumulated a deficit of $391.8 million
since it was founded in  Delaware  in 1988, according to a March 1
company filing.  
 Shares of Dendreon, based in  Seattle , gained 35 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $14.65 in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.
The stock more than tripled in the past week.  
 Cell Genesys has gained 68 percent this year and has
declined 27 percent in the past 12 months.
