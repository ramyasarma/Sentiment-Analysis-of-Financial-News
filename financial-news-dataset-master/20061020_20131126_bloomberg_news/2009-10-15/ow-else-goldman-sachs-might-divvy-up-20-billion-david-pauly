             Lloyd Blankfein , chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is in a pickle.  
 His investment  bank  yesterday said it had earmarked $16.7
billion for employee bonuses, equal to $527,192 per worker, from
its profit for the nine months ended Sept. 25. That put Goldman
Sachs on a pace to match the $20.1 billion in bonuses it chalked
up in 2007.  
 Blankfein has acknowledged that his firm’s massive payouts
put it in a bad light with both U.S. taxpayers -- who have
tossed billions in bailout money at Goldman Sachs and the rest
of the banking industry -- and critics of Wall Street’s bonus-
heavy pay system.  
 Let’s help Blankfein find a way out of this embarrassment,
showing him what else he might do with that $20 billion:  
 1. Use the money to increase next year’s pay for all
Goldman Sachs employees -- putting the bonus system to rest.  
 2. Share the money with Americans who rescued Wall Street
from the worst financial mess since the Great Depression.  
 3. Increase the firm’s paltry dividend payout.  
 4. Buy commercial banks.  
 5. All of the above.  
 Far-fetched, I know, but stick with me.  
 The bonus system -- typically amounting to 60 percent of
Wall Street’s pay -- is what led banks to take outsized risks in
disastrous subprime mortgages that fueled the credit debacle.
Why not raise 2010 salaries of Goldman Sachs employees by $20
billion and junk the bonuses? Or pay $5 billion in one-last-time
bonuses, raising salaries by the remainder?  
 Tax Return Bliss  
 Blankfein instead might go with my second option and send
the cash to the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS could pass it
on to citizens when they file their next income tax returns.  
 Divide $20 billion by  308 million , the U.S. population, and
you get about $65 apiece. Not a fortune though enough for people
to replenish their supplies of socks and underwear.  
 While Goldman keeps insisting that it didn’t need a
bailout, it must have found use for the $10 billion the
government invested in the company under the Troubled Asset
Relief Program.  
 The firm repaid the money as the financial crisis started
to ease -- but it also raised $10 billion by selling $5 billion
in preferred shares to  Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
and a like amount of common stock in a public offering. The
Federal Reserve is also backing Goldman debt. Blankfein does owe
us.  
 Owners’ Delight  
 It’s high time Goldman Sachs did something for its
shareholders, which brings us to option No. 3. The firm now only
 pays  out about $700 million a year in  dividends , a yield of less
than 1 percent  
 While Goldman’s shareholders have done fine on a total
return basis -- 15.6 percent annually in the five years ended
Sept. 30 -- the stock has declined from about $235 two years ago
to Thursday’s close of $188.63. How about resurrecting an
ancient corporate custom, the year-end dividend, and give more
back to the owners?  
 Option No. 4 comes to mind because at the depth of the
crisis, Goldman Sachs became a commercial bank, hoping that
would make the firm look less risky to investors.  
 Goldman could reduce its risk by acquiring a bigger
commercial bank base, getting billions in deposits to back up
its investment banking business. (While I’m opposed to big banks
getting bigger, that’s probably a lost cause.)  
 Status Quo  
 None of the above will happen, of course. Blankfein will
justify the huge bonuses by citing huge profits and Goldman’s
long-standing bonus system.  
 Goldman earned $3.19 billion, or $5.25 a share, in the
third quarter, as it continued to make big bets on the financial
markets.  
 By repaying the $10 billion to the Treasury, Blankfein has
wiggled out of government pay strictures that competitors like
 Citigroup  Inc. and  Bank of America Corp.  still face.  
 The pay culture may change on the rest of Wall Street. Not
at Goldman Sachs.
