             Summer movie attendance fell to the
lowest level since 1997, while soaring ticket prices produced
record revenue for Hollywood studios and theater owners.  
 The number of tickets sold from the first weekend of May
through the U.S. Labor Day holiday is expected to drop 2.6
percent to 552 million,  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement. That would be the lowest attendance
since summer moviegoers bought 540.3 million tickets in 1997.  
 “The movies just didn’t excite people the way they needed
to,”  Paul Dergarabedian , president of Hollywood.com Box-Office,
said in an interview. “When you raise prices and perceive that
quality goes down, you have a major problem.”  
 Summer box-office revenue will rise 2.4 percent to a record
$4.35 billion in the U.S. and Canada as higher prices more than
make up for the lower attendance, Hollywood.com estimates. The
average ticket price will increase 5.1 percent to $7.88 from
last year’s $7.50, the biggest gain since a 6.3 percent jump in
2000, Hollywood.com said.  
 Higher prices for 3-D movies including “Toy Story 3” and
“Shrek Forever After” helped lift revenue. Theaters charge an
extra $3 or more for three-dimensional showings. “Toy Story
3,” from  Walt Disney Co. , is the year’s top film so far with
$405.7 million in U.S. sales, according to  Box Office Mojo.com .  
 Studios released seven sequels this summer, fewer than the
10 that came out during the summer of 2009, according to
Hollywood.com. This year, 13 films generated more than $100
million in domestic ticket sales, down from 15 a year earlier.
