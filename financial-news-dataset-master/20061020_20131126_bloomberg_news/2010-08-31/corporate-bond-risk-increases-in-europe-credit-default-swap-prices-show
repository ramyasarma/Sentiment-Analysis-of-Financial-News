             The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 12 basis
points to 495, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 9 a.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals a deterioration in
the perception of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2 basis points to 108, JPMorgan
prices show. The cost of hedging against losses on financial
bonds also increased with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of
swaps on 25 banks and insurers climbing 6 basis points to 135.5.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
