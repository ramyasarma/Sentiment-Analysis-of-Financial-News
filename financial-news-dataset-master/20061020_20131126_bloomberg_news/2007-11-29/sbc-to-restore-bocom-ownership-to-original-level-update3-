             HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe's biggest
bank, will ``gradually'' restore its ownership in  Bank of
Communications Ltd . to the original level,  Peter Wong , an HSBC
executive director, said today in Beijing.  
 HSBC bought a 19.9 percent stake in Bocom, as the Chinese
bank is also known, for 14.46 billion  yuan  ($1.96 billion) in
August 2004. That holding was diluted to 18.1 percent when the
Chinese bank sold 3.19 billion yuan of shares in Shanghai in May.  
 HSBC has been increasing its ownership in Bocom since May.
Its latest purchases on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24 lifted its stake to
19 percent.  
 Bocom, the smallest of China's five major state-owned banks,
agreed to set up a credit card joint venture and an annuity
management firm with HSBC once regulations permit, the
Shanghai-based company's Chairman Jiang Chaoling said last month.  
 Bocom's Hong Kong-listed shares, which were sold at HK$2.50
in the initial public offering in June 2005, rose 2.9 percent to
close at HK$12.20, while HSBC advanced 2.1 percent to HK$132.30.
