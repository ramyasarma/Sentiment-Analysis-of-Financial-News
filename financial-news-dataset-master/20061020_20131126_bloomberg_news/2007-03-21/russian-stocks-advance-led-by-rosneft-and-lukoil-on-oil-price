             Russian stocks climbed, paced by OAO
Rosneft and OAO Lukoil after oil prices gained.  
 The ruble-based  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 1 percent to 1646.07. The
index has recovered 7 percent since the year's low on March 5.
The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  gained 0.9 percent to 1847.26.  
 Oil prices advanced in New York on concern that refinery
outages and rising U.S. gasoline demand could reduce supplies
during the peak summer season. About a third of the Micex Index
and half of the RTS Index is made up of oil and gas companies.  
 Rosneft, Russia's second-biggest oil producer, climbed 1.2
percent to 215.91 rubles on the Micex Stock Exchange. Lukoil, the
country's biggest oil producer, increased 0.8 percent to 2,078.35
rubles. OAO Surgutneftegaz, Russia's fourth-largest oil producer,
jumped 4.4 percent to 30.435 rubles.  
 Crude oil for May delivery added as much as 63 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $59.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 TNK-BP,  Russia 's third-largest oil producer, fell 1.6
percent to $2.17 on the RTS. BP Plc Chief Executive Officer John Browne and his successor will meet with Russian President
Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week, said BP, the British oil
company that owns half of TNK-BP.  
 State-controlled Rosneft or Gazprom could gain control of
part of TNK-BP as early as 2008, the London-based Guardian
reported yesterday.  
 Gazprom, TNK-BP  
 Norilsk fell 1.6 percent to 4,676 rubles after nickel prices
fell for a third day. The metal for three-month delivery lost 1.8
percent to $43,800 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  
 OAO Mobile TeleSystems, eastern Europe's largest mobile-phone company, added 3.8 percent to 256.68 rubles. Fourth-quarter
profit rose 16 percent to $280.3 million as the company's total
subscribers increased 25 percent to 72.9 million. Revenue grew 36
percent to $1.8 billion, the company said.  
 Shares of OAO Nizhny Tagil Iron & Steel Plant, 95 percent
owned by steelmaker Evraz Group SA, added 7.1 percent to $2.26 on
the RTS. Evraz, which is part-owned by billionaire Roman
Abramovich, offered to buy out minority shareholders in Nizhny
Tagil for 63.72 billion rubles ($2.45 billion), or $2.45 a share.  
 Moscow-based UralSib Financial Corp. said the Evraz offer
for Nizhny Tagil represents a ``good opportunity to exit the
stock.''  
 Shares of  OAO VSMPO-Avisma (VSMO) , the world's largest producer of
titanium, gained 2.4 percent to 8,278 rubles. Moscow-based Aton
Capital raised its price estimate for the shares 34 percent to
$318, saying the company plans to invest $1 billion to boost its
production of titanium sponge 75 percent to 56,000 tons.  
 Shares of OAO VimpelCom, Russia's second-biggest mobile
phone company, rose 2.2 percent to $95.70 in New York. Alfa
Group, Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's holding company,
raised its stake in the mobile telephone company to 42.4 percent
as  part of its fight with Telenor ASA, VimpelCom said in a
filing.
