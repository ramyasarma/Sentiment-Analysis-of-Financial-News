             Tribune Co., the second-largest
U.S. newspaper publisher, posted a 3.4 percent decline in
February revenue as advertising sales fell.  
 Revenue from advertising dropped 5.1 percent to $233
million last month, the Chicago-based company said today in a
statement. Consolidated revenue declined to $385 million as
circulation sales slipped 7 percent.  
 Classified advertising revenue dove 13 percent, propelled
by a 17 percent plunge in help-wanted ad sales. Automotive and
real estate classified revenue fell 14 percent each. Circulation
revenue slipped because of fewer single-copy sales and some
subscription discounting, said Tribune, owner of 11 newspapers
including the Los Angeles Times and  Chicago Tribune .  
 Shares of Tribune, also owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball
team and 23 television stations, fell 24 cents to $28.81 in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. They have
declined 6.4 percent this year.
