             OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN)  Chief
Operating Officer Ralph Tavakolian Morgan said a proposed
combination with United Co. Rusal, the world's largest aluminum
producer, may have ``merits.''  
 Rusal last week received antitrust approval to buy 25
percent of Norilsk,  Russia 's biggest mining company, from
billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov . The aluminum producer said in
December the stake would be the first step in a takeover.  
 ``There may be merits to a combination,'' Morgan said in an
interview today with Bloomberg Television in London without
elaborating. Rusal hasn't approached the Norilsk board or
management with a proposal, he said.  
 The maneuvering between the two companies is part of a
yearlong tussle between Prokhorov and rival billionaire investor
 Vladimir Potanin  over the future of Norilsk. Potanin waived his
right of first refusal to buy Prokhorov's Norilsk stake for
$15.7 billion on Dec. 21. Potanin's Interros Holding Co. said
the offer was ``unrealistic.''  
 Separately, Rusal made a verbal offer to Potanin to buy his
own holding in Norilsk, Vedomosti reported Jan. 22.  
 One hurdle to a tie-up between the two businesses would be
that Norilsk is ``a public company that is quite transparent,''
Morgan said. ``We will need to undertake a proper process, an
open process, one that will treat all shareholders fairly.''  
 Public Offering  
 Privately owned Rusal, formed last March from the merger of
OAO Russian Aluminum with domestic rival OAO Sual Group and the
alumina assets of Swiss commodities trader Glencore
International AG, plans to sell shares in a public offering by
April 2010.  
 The struggle over the assets ``is going to continue to
unfold this year,'' Morgan said. Norilsk management will seek to
ensure that shareholders can exit the company ``smoothly,''
without ``disrupting the operations,'' he said.  
 Norilsk advanced 213.75 rubles, or 3 percent, to 6,633.17
rubles at the close of trading in Moscow today, after gaining 38
percent in the past year.  
 Prokhorov would get 11 percent of Rusal and an unspecified
amount in cash for his 25 percent stake in Norilsk, worth $12
billion based on today's market price. He and Potanin have both
said an alliance between Norilsk and Rusal may be
``interesting.''  
 Nickel Outlook  
 Demand for nickel, used to make stainless steel, is
``recovering'' after record prices last year deterred purchases
and encouraged substitution, Morgan said in a separate
interview. ``The medium- to long-term price'' outlook is
``favorable for the industry,'' he said.  
 Nickel traded at a record $51,800 a metric ton on the
 London  Metal Exchange on May 9. It has since fallen 48 percent
to $27,050 a ton. Norilsk is the world's largest producer of
nickel and palladium, used in autocatalysts in cars.  
 ``When you have a price spike like you had last year you
get an overreaction,'' Morgan said. ``When that happens a lot of
people get out of the market and run down their stocks.''
