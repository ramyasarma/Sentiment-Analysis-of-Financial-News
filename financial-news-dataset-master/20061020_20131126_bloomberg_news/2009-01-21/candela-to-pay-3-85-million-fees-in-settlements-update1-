             Candela Corp., the maker of cosmetic
lasers whose shares have fallen 91 percent in the past year,
agreed to pay $3.85 million to settle federal securities claims.  
 Candela also will cover legal fees in a  Massachusetts 
lawsuit as part of the agreement. The Western Pennsylvania
Electrical Employees Pension Fund, in a complaint filed in April
in federal court in  Boston , alleged that Candela issued false
and misleading statements related to the value of the company’s
stock.  
 The shareholder’s  lawyers  said in settlement papers filed
Jan. 16 that they are “mindful of the inherent problems of
proof of, and possible defenses to, the allegations.”  
 Company officials denied any wrongdoing as part of the two
settlements, which are subject to court approval, Candela said
today in a statement.  
 The federal lawsuit also alleged company officials withheld
information on risks of a patent-infringement lawsuit by rival
Palomar Medical Technologies Inc.  
 In October, Palomar won a ruling from a federal jury in
Lufkin,  Texas , that it didn’t infringe a Candela patent.  
 Candela, based in Wayland, Massachusetts, reported a net
loss of $9.1 million in the fiscal year ended in June, on sales
of $148.2 million.  
 Candela fell 2 cents, or 5.1 percent, to 39 cents in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  
 The federal case is Western Pennsylvania Electrical
Employees Pension Fund v. Candela Corp., 08CV10551, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston).
