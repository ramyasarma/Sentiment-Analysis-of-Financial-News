             Reliant Energy Inc., owner of power
plants in nine U.S. states, agreed to sell its Channelview plant
in  Texas  to a unit of Kelson Energy for $468 million.  
 The transaction is expected to resolve the bankruptcy
proceedings when four units related to the plant filed for
Chapter 11 protection, Houston-based Reliant said today in a
statement. Sale proceeds will be used in settling claims of
about $379 million from secured creditors, $29 million from
unsecured creditors and a cash-sharing agreement, Reliant said.  
 The power station, located about 20 miles (32 kilometers)
east of downtown Houston, began full operation in 2002. It
produces steam and can generate 830 megawatts, enough power for
about 664,000 average U.S. homes, based on Energy Department
estimates.  
 The Channelview sale is subject to conditions such as the
approval of  bankruptcy court . The deal is expected to close in
the second or third quarter, Reliant said today in a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said
any gain or loss would depend on the net proceeds. Reliant's net
investment in and receivables from the plant totaled $83 million
at the end of last year.  
 Reliant fell 40 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $22.74 in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading.
