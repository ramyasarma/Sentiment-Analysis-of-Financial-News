             China Life Insurance Co. (2628)  and  Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co. (601318)  fell in Shanghai trading on concern that
investment returns will fall after the nation's stock market
tumbled to a six-month low.  
 Beijing-based China Life, the country's biggest insurer,
lost 6.4 percent to close at 35.44  yuan  on the Shanghai exchange.
Ping An, the No. 2, fell 5.8 percent to 65.38 yuan. China Life
and Ping An are the two  worst performers  on China's benchmark
index so far this year.  
 ``Chinese insurers are very dependent on their stock market
investments for profit growth, so they'll be harder hit than
other financials in a market downturn,'' said Yuan Lin, a
Beijing-based analyst at BOC International Holdings, the
investment-banking arm of Bank of China Ltd.  
 China's stocks fell today, pushing the nation's benchmark to
a six-month low, on speculation new shares will dilute existing
holdings. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  dropped 3.9 percent.  
 Ping An, based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen,
depends on investment gains from stocks and bonds for about 30
percent of revenue.
