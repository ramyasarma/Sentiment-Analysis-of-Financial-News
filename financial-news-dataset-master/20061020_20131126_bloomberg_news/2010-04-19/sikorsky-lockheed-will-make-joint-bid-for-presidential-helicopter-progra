             Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., a
subsidiary of United Technologies Corp., and Lockheed Martin
Corp. signed an agreement to compete jointly for the U.S. Navy’s
revived presidential-helicopter program.  
 The team will offer Sikorsky’s H-92 medium-lift helicopter,
the commercial variant of its S-92 aircraft, and Lockheed will
be the systems integrator, the companies said today in a
statement.  
 Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Maryland, earlier had
partnered with AgustaWestland, a subsidiary of Italy’s
Finmeccanica SpA, for the VH-71 presidential helicopter program.
In April 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates canceled the 28-
helicopter program because its cost had more than doubled to $13
billion since the team won the contract in January 2005.  
 The current fleet of presidential helicopters includes some
aircraft from Sikorsky that are 40 years old.  
 The U.S. House of Representatives tried to restore funds
for the canceled VH-71 in the 2010 defense budget. The Senate
rejected the measure.  
 Spokesman for Lockheed and Sikorsky didn’t immediately have
details on the value and number of aircraft the Navy would buy.
