             Sorouh Real Estate PJSC advanced
the most in more than three weeks after the developer signed an
agreement worth 5.4 billion dirhams ($1.5 billion) with Abu
Dhabi’s government to build homes for Emiratis.  
 The shares of Abu Dhabi’s second-biggest developer by
market value rose as much as 6.3 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since March 28, to 2.53 dirhams. The stock traded at 2.49
dirhams as of 10:23 a.m. in Abu Dhabi.  
 The “Watani” and “Shamkha” communities will provide
9,000 homes over the next five years, the company said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. The first phases of the developments
should be completed in August 2011 and in 2013, it said.
