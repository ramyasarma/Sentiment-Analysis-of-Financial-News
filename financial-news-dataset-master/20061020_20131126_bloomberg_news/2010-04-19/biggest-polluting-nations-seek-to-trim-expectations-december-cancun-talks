             The biggest polluting nations are
downplaying goals for climate-change talks in December after
failing last year to agree on a global treaty, the top U.S.
climate negotiator said.  
 Representatives from countries emitting the most greenhouse
gases agree it’s important not to let “expectations far
outstrip what can be done” at UN-led talks in Cancun, Mexico,
Todd Stern, President Barack Obama’s climate negotiator, said
yesterday.  
 Negotiators completed two days of meetings in Washington at
which they discussed short-term financing to help developing
nations cope with climate change, one of the issues that
thwarted agreement on a treaty. Countries failed to reach a
binding agreement at a meeting last year in Copenhagen.  
 There’s “no question” expectations for a treaty at
Copenhagen exceeded what could be achieved, Stern told reporters
today on a conference call. Support exists for a legal agreement
to control emissions, though officials are aware this “might
not happen,” he said.  
 Some participants took part in the Washington meeting by
video conference because the ash cloud from the Iceland volcano
canceled flights from European capitals, Stern said.
