             Most of Germany’s top executives
are dissatisfied with the record of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
junior coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, a
Handelsblatt Business Monitor poll showed.  
 Eighty-five percent of 517 top managers surveyed by polling
company Psephos GmbH said they were “mainly” or “fully”
dissatisfied with the FDP’s record, Handelsblatt said. Just 15
percent said they were mainly satisfied with the FDP led by
Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.
