             German and French government bond
yields may keep falling on bets interest rates in the region
will stay low because of the Greek fiscal crisis and disruption
from the volcanic ash cloud, High Frequency Economics said.  
 “Even if bunds were not the obvious safe haven for
investors fleeing Greece-driven euroland risks, they would be
attractive on soft economic fundamentals and no inflation,”
Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist in Valhalla, New York, wrote
in a report today. The European Central Bank “must realize that
no interest rate in the world can put euroland’s air transport
system back together again,” he said. “Yields may fall even
more on prospects that rates will remain low for even longer.
Watch for 10-year yields to continue their slow assault on the 3
percent barrier.”   
 The yield on the bund slipped almost 2 basis points to 3.07
percent as of 7:36 a.m. in London.
