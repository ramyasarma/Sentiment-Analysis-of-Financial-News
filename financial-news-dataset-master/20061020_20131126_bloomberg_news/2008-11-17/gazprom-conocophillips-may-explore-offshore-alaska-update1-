             OAO Gazprom said it may explore
offshore  Alaska  with  ConocoPhillips (COP)  as  Russia 's natural-gas
exporter seeks to expand its global reach.  
 Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller and his counterpart
from ConocoPhillips, Jim Mulva, held talks today in Moscow, state-run Gazprom said in a e-mailed statement.  
 Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of Europe's gas, is seeking
access to new markets in eastern Asia and North America, and a
delegation visited Alaska last month. Miller and Mulva today
discussed joint projects on international markets, focusing on
liquefied natural gas supplies, according to the statement.  
 ``The experience of Gazprom could be beneficial in developing
gas projects in the U.S.,'' Miller said in the statement.  
 Miller said in June that Gazprom had approached
ConocoPhillips and  BP Plc (BP/)  on joining their Denali pipeline
project, aimed at delivering Alaskan gas to the continental U.S.
Gazprom sent eight executives, including Miller and export chief
Alexander Medvedev, to Anchorage in October, where the delegation
met with Mulva and other ConocoPhillips representatives, as well
as local officials.  
 ConocoPhillips was not immediately available to comment.
