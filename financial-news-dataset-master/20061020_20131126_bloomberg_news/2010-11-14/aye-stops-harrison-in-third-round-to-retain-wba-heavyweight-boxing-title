Defending champion David Haye
pummeled  Audley Harrison  in the third round to retain by a
technical knockout his World Boxing Association heavyweight
crown.  Haye knocked Harrison down for an eight count in the third
round at MEN Arena in Manchester, England, then continued to
land punches until the referee stepped in to stop the all-
British title fight at one minute, 53 seconds.  Haye, 30, has scored 23 knockouts in his 25-1 career.
Harrison, 39, has 20 KOs in 28 wins against five losses.  Harrison, a former Olympic gold medalist, outweighed Haye
by more than 40 pounds and is two inches taller.  To contact the reporter on this story:
