An Australian Treasury report sent
to Prime Minister Julia Gillard said strong future immigration
is “probably inescapable,” WAToday.com.au reported. Should
annual net migration be cut to an unrealistically low 60,000 a
year, Australia’s population would still reach 29 million by
2050. “Given the powerful global forces driving the Australian
economy, net immigration figures well in excess of that low
number are probably inescapable,” the briefing said, according
to WAToday. “Strong population growth is not necessarily
unsustainable. It need not adversely affect the environment, the
liveability of cities, infrastructure and service delivery,
provided the right plans and policies are put in place now in
anticipation of it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
