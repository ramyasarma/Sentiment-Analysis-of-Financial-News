China’s Commerce Minister Chen
Deming said trade protectionism is rising after the global
financial crisis amid a “slow” economic recovery.  Trade fiction is rising amid “uncertainties” in the
global economy, Chen told a forum today in Macau, a Chinese
special autonomous region.  China will excempt tariffs for some products from
Portuguese-speaking developing nations in Asia and Africa in the
next three years, Chen told the forum for economic and trade
cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries in
Macau, a former Portuguese colony that returned to Chinese rule
in 1999.  China aims to boost bilateral trade and investment between
China and Portuguese-speaking nations, Chen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
