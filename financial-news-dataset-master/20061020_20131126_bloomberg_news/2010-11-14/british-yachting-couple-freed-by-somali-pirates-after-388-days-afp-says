Somali pirates freed a British
couple today, ending their captivity that began a year ago when
their yacht was hijacked off the Seychelles, Agence France-
Presse reported, citing its own correspondent.  Paul and Rachel Chandler arrived in Adado, a town near the
Ethiopian border, after the pirates handed them over to the
forces of the local self-proclaimed administration of Himan and
Heeb, the report said. They were held captive for 388 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
