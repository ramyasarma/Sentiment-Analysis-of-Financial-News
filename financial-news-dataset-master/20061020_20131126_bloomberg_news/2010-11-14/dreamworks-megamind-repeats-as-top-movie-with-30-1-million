(Correct spelling of Washington in second paragraph of
story published on Nov. 14.)  The animated comedy “Megamind” led
ticket sales at theaters in the U.S. and Canada for a second
weekend, generating $30.1 million for DreamWorks Animation Inc.
and distributor Paramount Pictures.  “Unstoppable,” an action film starring Denzel Washington,
opened in second place with $23.5 million, researcher
Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed statement.
The science-fiction thriller “Skyline” opened with $11.7
million.  “Megamind,” featuring Brad Pitt and Will Ferrell, is the
third film from Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg’s
DreamWorks Animation to open in first place this year. The
results have helped put Paramount, owned by Viacom Inc., in
second place among distributors this year with $1.5 billion in
domestic ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo.  “It was a little bit of a stretch to think that an action
film could top such a family-friendly market right now,” said
Jeff Bock, box-office analyst for Los Angeles-based researcher
Exhibitor Relations Co. “Now that we’re in the holiday season,
family films and, more specifically, animated films rarely drop
from weekend to weekend very significantly.”  DreamWorks Animation’s previous 2010 releases were “How to
Train Your Dragon,” with $217.6 million in domestic sales, and
“Shrek Forever After,” with $238.4 million, according to Box
Office Mojo.  ‘Unstoppable’  In “Megamind,” a criminal genius voiced by Ferrell
finally outwits superhero Metro Man, played by Pitt. In the wake
of his victory, Megamind must decide how to respond to the
arrival of another, rival villain. The film has taken in $89.8
million since it was released on Nov. 5.  In “Unstoppable,” Washington plays a veteran engineer and
Chris Pine portrays an inexperienced conductor. They team up in
an effort to halt a runaway train carrying flammable materials.
The movie, from News Corp.’s Twentieth Century Fox, was directed
by Tony Scott.  Warner Bros.’ “Due Date” dropped to third place from
second with $15.5 million. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr. as
a man trying to get home in time for the birth of his first
child. After missing his flight, he hitches a ride with an
aspiring actor played by “The Hangover” co-star Zach
Galifianakis.  ‘Morning Glory’  “Skyline,” from Universal Pictures, was fourth. In the
movie, a group of friends awaken one morning to find that
humanity is under attack from an otherworldly force. The film
stars Eric Balfour and Scottie Thompson.  The romantic comedy “Morning Glory,” from Paramount,
finished fifth with $9.6 million in receipts. It stars Rachel
McAdams as the producer of a morning television show, and
Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton play the show’s egotistical co-
anchors.  “The adult market, they don’t necessarily rush out to see
a film,” said Bock. “It’s hard to say that this is a ‘fail’
right away. We’ll know more in week four or five, depending on
how it holds up over the Thanksgiving holiday.”  The weekend’s top 12 films grossed $114.2 million, down
11.8 percent from a year earlier, according to Hollywood.com.
This year’s total increased to $9.1 billion, up 3.3 percent from
a year earlier. Total attendance is down 1.79 percent.  The amounts below are based on actual ticket sales for Nov.
12-13 and estimates for today.  Rev.            Avg./   Pct.   Total
