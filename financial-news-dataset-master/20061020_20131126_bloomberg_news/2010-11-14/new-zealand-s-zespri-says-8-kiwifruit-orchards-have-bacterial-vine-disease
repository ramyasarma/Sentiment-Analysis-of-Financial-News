New Zealand officials said eight
kiwifruit orchards, double yesterday’s figure, have been
confirmed with a bacterial vine disease and 11 sites have been
quarantined.  There’s no change to the import status, after the U.S.,
Australia and Taiwan earlier stopped imports of kiwifruit
nursery stock, or plant cuttings imported for growing, Zespri,
the largest seller of the fruit, said in a statement today.    New Zealand, the world’s biggest grower of kiwifruit after
China and Italy, accounts for about 21 percent of global
production. Kiwifruit exports totaled NZ$1.4 billion ($1.1
billion) in the year ending March 31, according to Zespri.  Zespri said yesterday it hoped New Zealand would be the
first country to completely eradicate the airborne bacteria,
admitting it may not be possible if it is too widespread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
