The New York Mets interviewed their
minor league manager Ken Oberkfell for the vacant manager’s
position, and plan to visit St. Louis Cardinals’ third-base
coach  Jose Oquendo  next week.  Jerry Manuel , 56, was fired last month after the Mets
missed the postseason for a fourth straight year.  Oberkfell, 54, managed the Mets’ Triple-A affiliate for the
past six seasons, except for a stint as first base coach of the
major league team in the second half of the 2008 season.  General Manager  Sandy Alderson  traveled to the Dominican
Republic yesterday to interview Oberkfell, who managed Escogido
to the Caribbean Series title last season, the team said.  Oberkfell’s major league career spanned 16 years between
1977 and 1992, primarily as an infielder for the St. Louis
Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Francisco
Giants, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels. He played for the
1982 World Series Cardinals.  Alderson goes to Orlando, Florida, on Nov. 15 to visit
Oquendo, 47, who played shortstop for the Mets at the start of
his career from 1983-84. The remainder of his 12 years as a
player in the majors was with the Cardinals, where he played
infield and outfield, as well as pitcher and catcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
