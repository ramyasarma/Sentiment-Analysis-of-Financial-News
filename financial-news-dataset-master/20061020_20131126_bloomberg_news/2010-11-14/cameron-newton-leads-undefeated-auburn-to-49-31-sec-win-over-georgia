Cameron Newton  scored two touchdowns
and passed for two more as undefeated Auburn University, the No.
2 ranked college football team, defeated the University of
Georgia 49-31.  Until the game began it wasn’t certain Newton would start
as Auburn’s quarterback after ESPN reported his college choice
was part of a play-for-pay recruiting plan and Fox Sports
reported that he had three instances of cheating while at the
University of Florida in 2007 and 2008.  Newton is “solid as a rock,” coach  Gene Chizik  said in a
televised interview. “He’s one of the best young men I’ve ever
been around.”  The Auburn Tigers (11-0, 7-0 SEC) clinched the Southeastern
Conference West championship today at Jordan-Hare Stadium in
Auburn, Alabama.  “Right now we deserve to be SEC champs,” Chizik said. “I
cannot give enough credit to our seniors. They never sweat. We
were playing sloppy in the beginning. They never get down; they
stay focused.”  Newton put Auburn on the board with a 31-yard scoring run
less than three minutes into the first quarter.  Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray threw for three unanswered
scores, putting the Bulldogs (5-6, 3-5 SEC) ahead 21-7 at the
end of the first. He completed 15 of 28 passing attempts for 273
yards.  Auburn dominated the second quarter with a 4-yard run by
Onterio McCalebb, his first of three scores, and Newton’s 18-
yard pass to Philip Lutzenkirchen to tie the game at 21-21 at
the half.  McCalebb scored twice in the third quarter as Auburn went
up 35-31. Washaun Ealey ran for seven yards for a Georgia
touchdown and Blair Walsh hit a 28-yard field goal.  Newton ended the game with a 13-yard touchdown completion
to Lutzenkirchen and a one-yard scoring run. He completed 12 of
15 passing attempts for 147 yards and carried 30 times for 153
yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
