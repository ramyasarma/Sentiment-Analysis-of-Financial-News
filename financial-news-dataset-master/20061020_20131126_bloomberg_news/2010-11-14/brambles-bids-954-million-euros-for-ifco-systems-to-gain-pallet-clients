Brambles Ltd.  offered 696 million
euros ($950 million) for Ifco Systems NV to add  plastic
containers  used for shipping fruit and vegetables by companies
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Metro AG.  The bid is valued at 13.50 euros per share, Sydney-based
Brambles said today in a statement. That’s 20 percent more than
Ifco’s closing price on Nov. 12.  Island International Investment
LP , majority owned by funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, said
separately that it agreed with other investors to sell a
combined 96 percent stake in Ifco.  Brambles  surged  the most in almost three months in Sydney
trading after saying the purchase of Ifco will boost sales 16
percent. The company, operator of the world’s largest pallet
pool, also said it’s “on track” to meet its profit forecast.
Ifco rose  the most  in more than 11 months in Frankfurt trading.  The acquisition “will enhance the company’s competitive
position and optimize its network of pallet-service centers,”
Standard & Poor’s said today in a statement. The credit rating
company said Brambles’ BBB+ rating with a stable outlook is
“unaffected” by the Ifco bid.  Brambles jumped 5.4 percent to A$6.88 in as of the 4:10
p.m. close of trading. The  acquisition  is the company’s largest
since  Tom Gorman  took over as chief executive officer 12 months
ago. In September, the company agreed to buy Unitpool AG, which
runs a pooling system for air-cargo containers.  Ifco’s Pallets  Ifco , which has its headquarters in Amsterdam, jumped as
much as 2.19 euros, or 19 percent, to 13.44 euros, the biggest
intraday gain since Jan. 7, and was up 18 percent as of 10:18
a.m. in Frankfurt.  The Dutch company also repairs and rents out wooden pallets
used to move and store goods in addition to its fruit and
vegetable containers. Ifco operated a pool of 112 million
plastic produce containers as of Sept. 30, up from 102 million
units as of the end of last year,  Sabine Preiss , a spokeswoman
in Munich, said today.  Brambles , whose blue wooden pallets use the Chep brand,
will fund the 50 percent of the transaction with debt from
existing facilities and the other 50 percent with stock,
including dividend reinvestments and A$110 million ($108
million) in the sale of new shares to current investors.  The Australian company is paying 7.2 times Ifco’s forecast
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in
the year ending June 2011, according to a separate statement.  Buyers of packaging and containers businesses in the past
five years have paid a median multiple of 6.8 times Ebitda,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. UBS AG is advising
Brambles.  Brambles’ Forecast  The company reiterated today that it expects profit before
interest, tax and acquisition costs totaling $740 million to
$780 million in the 12 months through June 2011.  Chep Americas posted revenue growth of 4 percent to $530
million in the four months ended Oct. 31. In Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, sales fell 3 percent to $496 million amid
declines in the euro and British pound.  Sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 12 percent to $140
million, the company said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
