Japanese  bonds  declined, boosting
benchmark yields by the most in 10 weeks, after a government
report showed gross domestic product in the third quarter grew
more than economists predicted as consumer spending increased.  Ten-year bonds slid for the sixth time in seven days as
domestic  stocks  climbed before a report forecast to show U.S.
retail sales advanced for a fourth month. Societe Generale SA
recommends investors bet that 10- and 30-year yields will rise
relative to five- and 20-year rates.  “The GDP report has eased concerns about the economic
outlook for the October-March period,” said  Akio Yoshino , who
helps oversee the equivalent of $36 billion as chief economist
at Amundi Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “Considering the situation of
Japan’s economy, current bond yields are too low.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond jumped 7.5 basis
points to 1.05 percent as of 3:36 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1
percent security due September 2020 declined 0.670 yen to 99.554.
The gain in the yield was the most since Sept. 2.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery dropped 0.57 to
142.02 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Japan’s  gross domestic product  rose an annualized 3.9
percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, the Cabinet Office
said today. Economists had estimated a 2.5 percent increase.  ‘Not Pessimistic’  “The Asian economy has hit bottom, and the climate for the
export market is expected to improve toward year-end,” said
 Masaaki Kanno , chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
Tokyo. “I’m not pessimistic about Japan’s economic
fundamentals.”  Retail sales in the U.S., Japan’s second-largest export
market, rose 0.7 percent last month, compared with a 0.6 percent
gain in September, according to the median economist estimate in
a Bloomberg survey before the data are released today.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average jumped 1.1 percent as the yen
slid to as low as 82.98 per dollar, the weakest since Oct. 7. A
weaker yen increases the value of exporters’ overseas sales.  “The bond market has run out of catalysts to buy,” said
 Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc., one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at
government debt sales.  Yield Spread  Investors should sell 10- and 30-year bonds and buy 20- and
five-year debt, according to  Christian Carrillo , head of Asia-
Pacific rates strategy at Societe Generale.  “We see little reason for the 20-year auction on Nov. 18
to disappoint given the recent increase in offered yields,” he
wrote in a report on Nov. 12. “Should this auction perform as
we expect, this would be another catalyst for further flattening
in 10- to 20-year JGBs.”  The  yield  spread between Japan’s 20-year and 10-year debt
was about 89 basis points. It expanded to 90.4 on Nov. 12, a
level not seen since March 2008.  The Ministry of Finance will sell 1.1 trillion yen ($13.3
billion) of 20-year debt on Nov. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
