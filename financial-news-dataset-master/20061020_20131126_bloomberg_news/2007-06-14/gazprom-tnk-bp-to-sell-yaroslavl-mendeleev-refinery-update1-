             OAO Slavneft, jointly owned by OAO
Gazprom's oil arm and  BP Plc (BP/) 's Russian venture, will auction a
52 percent stake in the Yaroslavl Mendeleev oil refinery after
boosting capacity at its other refinery.  
 Slavneft is offering the Yaroslavl Mendeleev plant, which
processes oil for state-run OAO Rosneft, with a starting price
of 334 million rubles ($13 million) on July 16, Moscow-based
Slavneft said on its Web site today. The sale includes ZAO
Rusoil-Moskva, which produces plastic containers and packages
the refinery's products.  
 Slavneft decided to sell the refinery, which needs $9
million of investment, after boosting capacity at its larger
Yaroslavlnefteorgsintez refinery, said Slavneft spokeswoman
Maria Gridneva.  
 Rosneft, which became the country's biggest oil producer
and refiner this year after buying OAO Yukos Oil Co. assets
through forced auctions, may bid for the Yaroslavl Mendeleev
refinery.  
 ``We'll look at the refinery,'' said Rosneft spokesman
Nikolai Manvelov by telephone today.  
 Deloitte & Touche valued the refinery at $15 million and
Rusoil-Moskva at $4.7 million, Slavneft said. The refinery has
capacity to process 300,000 tons of oil a year.
