             Tony Hall, the 58-year-old chief
executive of London’s Royal Opera House, has been named as a
peer in the House of Lords, the U.K. parliament’s upper
chamber, the House of Lords said on its Web site.  
 Hall, who has run the opera house since April 2001, is one
of four non-party-political peers named today by the upper
house’s appointments commission, an independent body set up a
decade ago to name non-political professionals as peers.  
 “He is passionate about arts, culture and all aspects of
broadcasting and the media, and his enthusiasm has been a vital
ingredient in reshaping the Royal Opera House for the 21st
century,” said the opera house’s chairman Simon Robey in an e-
mailed press release. Robey is the head of Morgan Stanley U.K.
and co-chairman of global mergers and acquisitions.  
 The other three new peers include Tanni Grey-Thompson,
Britain’s most successful Paralympian.  
 Hall also chairs the Cultural Olympiad, the program of
cultural events for the London 2012 Olympics, and previously
served as director and then chief executive of BBC News and
Current Affairs from 1989 to 2001.
