Hungarian central bank President
 Andras Simor  said the country must accelerate its integration
into the euro area.  Hungary doesn’t have a target date for the switchover after
a lack of fiscal rigor forced the country to abandon several
self-imposed goals since joining the European Union in 2004. The
government last month committed to bring the  budget  shortfall to
within the 27-nation bloc’s limit of 3 percent of output next
year.  Eastern Europe’s nations agreed to eventually abandon their
national currencies at the time of EU entry. Estonia in January
will become the 17th member of the euro area and the third
former communist country, after Slovenia and Slovakia. Hungary’s
government estimates that the country may meet the conditions
for the switchover by 2014 or 2015.  “We have to make sure we will integrate and have a
sustainable framework for integration,” Simor said at a
conference in Washington today. Euro adoption is “something
that’s primarily in the government’s responsibility, together
with the central bank. We haven’t heard from the government so
far.”  Hungary “must not relent” from its commitment to adopt
the euro “as soon as possible,”  Mihaly Varga , Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban ’s chief of staff, said on Sept. 30. The government
needs to come up with a “credible road map” that lets Hungary
join the euro area within a “realistic” timeframe, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
