Vivendi SA  and  Vodafone Group Plc  may
put talks over the U.K. company’s 44 percent stake in French
mobile operator SFR on their agenda in the coming months, the
French weekly  Journal des Finances  said, citing Vivendi Chief
Executive Officer  Jean-Bernard Levy .  Vivendi doesn’t want to go to financial markets to fund a
purchase of the stake nor does it want to imperil its BBB debt
rating from Standard & Poor’s, the weekly said, citing Levy.
There are currently no discussions over the stake, the newspaper
said, citing Levy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
