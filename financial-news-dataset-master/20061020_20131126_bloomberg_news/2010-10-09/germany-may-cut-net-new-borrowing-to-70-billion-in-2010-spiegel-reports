The German government may cut net new
borrowing to about 50 billion euros ($70 billion) this year and
to 47.5 billion euros in 2011,  Der Spiegel  reported, without
citing anyone.  Tax revenue may be as much as 7 billion euros above target
in 2010 because Germany’s economic recovery has helped limit
spending on unemployment benefits, the magazine said in an
advance copy of an article for its Oct. 11 edition. Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s coalition government is seeking to reduce net
borrowing needs next year by as much as 10 billion euros from
the planned 57.5 billion euros, according to Der Spiegel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
