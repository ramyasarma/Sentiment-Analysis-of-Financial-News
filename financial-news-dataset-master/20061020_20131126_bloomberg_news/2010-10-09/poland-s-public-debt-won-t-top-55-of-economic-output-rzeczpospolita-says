Poland’s public debt is unlikely to
rise above 55 percent of gross domestic product, said  Michal Boni , chief adviser to Prime Minister  Donald Tusk , in an
interview with  Rzeczpospolita .  “The economic growth should be fast and stable enough in
two years to dismiss a threat of exceeding the 55 percent
level,” he said, adding that the current level is about 51
percent of GDP.  Boni said “a more serious problem” for Poland is the
budget deficit. Tusk said earlier this week that the general
government deficit may widen to 7-8 percent of GDP this year
from 7.1 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
