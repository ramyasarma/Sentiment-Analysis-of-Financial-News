U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  renewed his call for China to let its currency rise, in
a speech to the International Monetary Fund that said countries
with big foreign exchange reserves are distorting the global
financial system.  Geithner did not cite China by name, instead referring to
countries whose currencies are “significantly undervalued.”
That is the phrase the U.S. has used to describe the yuan’s
relationship to the dollar.  “It is critical to see more progress by the major emerging
economies to more flexible, more market-oriented exchange rate
management,” Geithner said today in Washington.  “This is
particularly important for those countries whose currencies are
significantly undervalued.”  Geithner said the IMF should have more authority to
identify problem spots and prescribe remedies. He also said the
fund should make all of its economic assessments public, not
just when a country consents.  “Excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading
to serious distortions in the international monetary and
financial system, and is inhibiting the international adjustment
process,” Geithner said.  The Treasury chief reiterated that promoting growth should
be the top priority for the world’s economies. He said countries
should not rely on exports to the U.S. to keep their economies
healthy.  “As America saves more, countries overly reliant on
exports for their own growth will need to change their policies,
or else global growth will slow and all of us will be worse
off,” Geithner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
