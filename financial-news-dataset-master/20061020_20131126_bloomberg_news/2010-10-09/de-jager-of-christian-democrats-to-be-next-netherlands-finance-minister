The Netherlands intends to appoint
Christian Democrat Jan Kees de Jager as Minister of Finance, the
government information service said in an e-mailed
statement today.  De Jager succeeded Labor Party’s Wouter Bos as finance
minister in February, after the coalition cabinet they were part
of broke up and Bos resigned. De Jager was state secretary of
finance until then.  The Dutch Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic
Alliance agreed last month to form a minority government with
the support of Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
