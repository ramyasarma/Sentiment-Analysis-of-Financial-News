British aid worker Linda Norgrove has
been killed by her captors in Afghanistan during a rescue
attempt, U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said in an e-
mailed statement.  “It is with deep sadness that I must confirm that Linda
Norgrove, the British aid worker who had been held hostage in
eastern Afghanistan since Sept. 26, was killed at the hands of
her captors in the course of a rescue attempt last night,”
Hague said in the statement.  “Working with our allies we received information about
where Linda was being held and we decided that, given the danger
she was facing, her best chance of safe release was to act on
that information,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
