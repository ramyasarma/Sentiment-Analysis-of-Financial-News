Deutsche Lufthansa AG  will trim
surcharges on ticket prices for certain low-cost routes next
year even as a new national levy is looming,  Der Spiegel 
reported, citing no one.  Lufthansa will lower surcharges for fuel and security costs
on routes including Munich-Hamburg from Jan. 1, the magazine
said. Conversely,  Air Berlin Plc  is planning to fully roll
higher costs from the new tax into ticket prices, Der Spiegel
said, citing Chief Executive Officer Joachim Hunold.  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government agreed last month to
impose charges of between 8 euros ($11.13) and 45 euros on all
flights out of Germany from Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
