Ryanair Holdings Plc  may drop its
base in Marseille and move its aircraft and personnel to
airports outside of France, the French daily  Le Parisien  said,
citing an internal letter by Chief Executive Michael O’Leary.  The letter, signed Oct. 4, came a week after preliminary
charges for failing to properly report French employees to the
government were filed against the airline, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
