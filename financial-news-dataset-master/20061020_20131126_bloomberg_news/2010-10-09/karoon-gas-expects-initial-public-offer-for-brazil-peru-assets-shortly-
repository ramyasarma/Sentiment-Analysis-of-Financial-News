Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. said an
initial public offering of its assets in Brazil and Peru may
take place “shortly” with the company expecting to sell about
30 percent of its assets in the region through the process. The
company said it has funding in place for its drilling program in
the Browse Basin in Australia and may use future sales contracts
to fund developments, Chief Executive Officer Bob Hosking told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. television today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
