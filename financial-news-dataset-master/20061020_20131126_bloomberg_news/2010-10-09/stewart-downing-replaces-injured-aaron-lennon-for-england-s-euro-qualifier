Aston Villa midfielder Stewart
Downing will replace Aaron Lennon on the England soccer squad
for its European Championship qualifier against Montenegro.  Tottenham’s Lennon will miss the Oct. 12 match at Wembley
Stadium in London with a sore back, the English Football
Association said on its website.  Lennon is the second player to withdraw in the past two
days after Everton defender Phil Jaglieka was ruled out with a
hamstring injury. He was replaced by Bolton’s Gary Cahill.  Montenegro has won all three of its qualifiers to lead
Group G with nine points. England is second with six points from
two matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
