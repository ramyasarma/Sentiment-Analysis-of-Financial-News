Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s
United Russia party settled on a short-list of candidates to
succeed ousted Mayor  Yury Luzhkov .  Party leaders nominated Transport Minister  Igor Levitin ,
Deputy Prime Minister  Sergei Sobyanin , Nizhny Novgorod Regional
Governor  Valery Shantsev  and First Deputy Mayor of Moscow
Lyudmila Shvetsova, the party said on its  website .  Party leaders today presented the list to President  Dmitry Medvedev , who is expected to announce the name of the new mayor
within 10 days in accordance with the Russian law, according to
the website statement.  “Each candidate is capable of leading the capital,”
Medvedev told party leaders during a televised meeting. “The
new mayor’s main task will still consist of maintaining living
standards, resolving social problems and implementing social
policies but obviously on a whole different level, given that
Moscow has got a number of problems.”  Medvedev fired Luzhkov on Sept. 28 after 18 years at the
helm of the country’s biggest city, citing “loss of
confidence.” He named  Vladimir Resin , a Luzhkov deputy, as
acting mayor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
