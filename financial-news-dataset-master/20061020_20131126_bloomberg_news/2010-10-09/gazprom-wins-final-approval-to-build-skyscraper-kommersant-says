OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil unit of
Russia’s state natural-gas producer, won final approval from the
government to build what may become Europe’s tallest skyscraper
in the center of St. Petersburg,  Kommersant  reported, citing
unidentified company officials.  The state expert assessment department gave Gazprom Neft
permission to proceed with the construction of the 403-meter
(1,300-foot) Okhta Center project, the Moscow-based newspaper
said.  The protesters oppose the proposed skyscraper, saying it
will spoil the city’s historic skyline. Valentina Matviyenko,
St. Petersburg’s governor, last year approved the construction
of the building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
