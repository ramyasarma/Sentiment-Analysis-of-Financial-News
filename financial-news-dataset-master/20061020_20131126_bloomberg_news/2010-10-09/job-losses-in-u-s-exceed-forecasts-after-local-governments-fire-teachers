The U.S. lost more jobs than forecast
in September as local governments fired educators and other
workers to make up for declining tax revenue.  Payrolls fell by 95,000 workers after a revised 57,000
decrease in August, the Labor Department said yesterday in
Washington. Companies added 64,000 jobs, less than forecast,
while the  unemployment rate  held at 9.6 percent.  A lack of jobs is hampering consumer spending, the biggest
part of the economy, limiting growth heading into 2011. The
 dollar  weakened and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed
above 11,000 as the report bolstered speculation the Federal
Reserve will embark on a renewed round of large-scale asset
purchases to spur the recovery.  “This is really just the first step in a long line of
layoffs in the public sector,” said  Lindsey Piegza , an
economist at FTN Financial in New York. “The momentum in the
private sector is very minimal. There are all of these
uncertainties hanging over the private sector right now.”  The dollar decreased 0.3 percent to 82.18 yen at 4:05 p.m.
in New York yesterday. The Dow climbed 0.5 percent to close at
11,006.48, the highest since May 3.  The unemployment rate was forecast to rise to 9.7 percent,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
83 economists. Total payrolls were projected to fall by 5,000,
while private payrolls were forecast to rise by 75,000.
Revisions show that companies hired 93,000 in August and 117,000
in July, indicating a slower pace of job growth.  Government Jobs  Government payrolls decreased by 159,000 last month. State
and local governments reduced employment by 83,000, while the
federal agencies lost 76,000 jobs as census workers were fired,
the Labor Department said yesterday.  State and local governments from New Jersey to California
are firing workers to balance their budgets as declining
property values and slowing economic growth squeeze tax revenue.  Public schools in New Jersey were set to start the academic
year down 10,000 jobs, including 7,000 educators who chose to
retire,  Steve Wollmer , a spokesman for the New Jersey Education
Association, a union that represents teachers, said in August
after Governor  Chris Christie  slashed $1.3 billion in aid to
schools and local governments.  Yesterday’s jobs report is the last before the Nov. 2
congressional elections that threaten to deprive the Democrats
of their majorities in the House and Senate, partly as a result
of voter disenchantment with Congress and President  Barack Obama ’s handling of the economy.  Sinking Approval  Obama’s job approval over a three-day period that ended
Oct. 6 was 46 percent,  compared  with 53 percent at the same time
last year, according to a poll from Princeton, New Jersey-based
Gallup Inc.  “We need to continue to explore ways that we can help
states and local governments maintain workers who provide vital
services,” Obama said yesterday in Bladensburg, Maryland. “At
the same time, we have to keep doing everything we can to
accelerate this recovery.”  Obama on Aug. 10 signed into law legislation providing $26
billion in aid to state governments. The bill was designed to
prevent thousands of layoffs of teachers and other public
service employees.  The jobless rate has equaled or exceeded 9.5 percent for 14
consecutive months, surpassing the 13-month period from mid 1982
to mid 1983 as the longest span of elevated joblessness since
monthly records began in 1948.  Unemployment Forecast  The unemployment rate is forecast to average 9.2 percent
next year, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists last month.  “Further action is likely to be warranted unless the
economic outlook evolves in a way that makes me more confident
that we will see better outcomes for both employment and
inflation before too long,” New York Fed President  William Dudley  said in an Oct. 1 speech, a day after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a statement that the central bank has a duty to
aid the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee next meets
Nov. 2-3.  The economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual pace in the second
quarter after expanding at a 3.7 percent rate in the first three
months of the year and 5 percent at the end of 2009.  The buying power of consumers isn’t improving, yesterday’s
report showed. Average hourly earnings were little changed at
$19.10, and the average work week for all workers held at 34.2
hours.  Census Workers  The decrease in overall payrolls reflected a 77,000 decline
of temporary workers hired by the government to conduct the
decennial population count and a 49,800 drop in teaching jobs at
the local government level.  The unwinding of census employment has distorted the
payroll figures for months as the government dismissed workers
as the count winds down. Only about 6,000 census workers remain
on the payrolls, indicating September may be the last month the
jobs data will be distorted.  Manufacturing payrolls decreased by 6,000 after declining
28,000 a month earlier. Economists projected a 2,000 increase
for September. Employment at service-providers decreased 73,000.
Construction companies subtracted 21,000 workers and retailers
hired 5,700 workers.  The so-called underemployment rate -- which includes part-
time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and people who
want work but have given up looking -- increased to 17.1 percent
from 16.7 percent.  The Labor Department also published its preliminary
estimate for the annual benchmark revisions to payrolls that
will be issued in February. The revision may mean the worst
recession since the 1930s resulted in the loss of 8.73 million
jobs, up from the 8.36 million currently on the books.  Government Revisions  Regular monthly revisions showed bigger decreases in
payrolls than previously estimated for July and August. The
adjustments reflected bigger losses in government, while private
payrolls were pushed up. Companies hired 93,000 workers in
August and 117,000 in July, compared with previously estimated
gains of 54,000 for each month.  While some companies are still firing employees, others are
recalling workers. American Airlines, the third largest U.S.
airline and a unit of AMR Corp., plans to recall 545 flight
attendants and 250 pilots to meet demand for international
flights as it begins it begins an alliance with British Airways
Plc and Spain’s Iberia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
