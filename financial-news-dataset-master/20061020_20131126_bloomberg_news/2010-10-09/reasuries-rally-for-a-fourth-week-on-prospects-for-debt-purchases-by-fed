Treasury  notes rallied for a fourth
week as data showing U.S. employers cut more jobs than forecast
last month increased speculation the Federal Reserve will start
a new program of buying bonds to stimulate the economy.  Yields on two- and five-year notes reached record lows
yesterday after the government said employers cut 95,000 jobs,
fueling concern the economic recovery is stalling. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said Oct. 4 that quantitative easing, a strategy
in which the Fed purchases assets, would probably spur growth.
Inflation slowed last month, a report next week may show.  “The economy is still recovering, but it’s slowing down,”
said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa
Securities America Inc., one of 18 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “The market is anticipating a new round of QE. We
could go lower in yields.”  The two-year  note yield  fell 7 basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 0.343 percent, from 0.41 percent on Oct. 1,
according to BGCantor Market Data. It touched 0.3351 percent
yesterday, the least ever, marking the sixth straight day it set
or matched a record low. The  five-year  note yield touched 1.0686
percent yesterday, reaching a record low level for the fifth
consecutive day.  The yield on the 10-year note dropped 12 basis points to
2.4 percent, from 2.51 percent on Oct. 1. It reached 2.3302
percent yesterday, the lowest level since Jan. 20, 2009. The
2.625 percent security due in August 2020 gained 1, or $10 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102.  Bond Auctions  Thirty-year bonds  fell, pushing yields up 3 basis points to
3.75 percent, as investors speculated the Fed will buy shorter-
term securities and the government said it will auction $13
billion of so-called long bonds next week.  The U.S. will sell $66 billion in notes and bonds next
week: $32 billion in 3-year notes on Oct. 12, $21 billion in 10-
year securities the next day and $13 billion in 30-year bonds on
Oct. 14, the Treasury Department said.  Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said the payrolls data was a
“strong signal” for a new round of asset purchases by the Fed.  Employers eliminated 95,000 jobs after a revised decrease
of 57,000 in August, Labor Department figures in Washington
showed. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
5,000-position drop. Private payrolls that exclude government
agencies increased 64,000, less than forecast. The  unemployment
rate  unexpectedly held steady at 9.6 percent.  ‘Harbinger’ of Restraint  “A lot of government jobs were lost at the state and local
level, which may be a harbinger of fiscal restraint,”  David Ader , head of government bond strategy at Stamford, Connecticut-
based CRT Capital Group LLC, wrote in a note to clients. The
next big move in Treasuries will come upon confirmation of
quantitative-easing plans, he wrote.  St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said in a CNBC
interview yesterday the economy may not have slowed enough to
make a strong case for quantitative easing.  The central bank completed a program in March in which it
acquired $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and
about $175 billion of agency debt to spur economic recovery. The
Fed was the biggest buyer of Treasuries when it purchased $300
billion of them in 2009.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., another primary dealer, said it
expects the Fed to announce renewed asset purchases at its two-
day policy meeting that starts on Nov. 2.  ‘At Least $1 Trillion’  “QE-1 eased financial conditions significantly --
suggesting that QE-2 could also have sizable effects on asset
prices,” economists led by  Jan Hatzius , New York-based chief
U.S. economist at the firm, wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. “We regard an initial announcement of $500 billion
as likely but anticipate that the size of the purchase program
will ultimately total at least $1 trillion.”  Gross expects the Fed to buy about $100 billion per month,
or $1.2 trillion a year, he said yesterday in a radio interview
on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene.  Barclays Plc, a primary dealer, said in a note it expects
the central bank to begin a buying program in November, “with an
announcement on the flow of Treasury purchases, such as $100
billion per month, without a fixed endpoint.”  The gap in  yields  between 30-year bonds and comparable
inflation-indexed debt, an indication of inflation expectations,
rose to 2.32 percentage points as speculation increased the Fed
will resume bond buys. It was the highest since June 29 and
compared with a 15-month low of 1.84 percentage points Aug. 25.  “The 30-year is reflecting the impact of inflationary
policies from QE 2,” Gross said.  The rise in consumer prices slowed to 0.2 percent in
September, from 0.3 percent in August, according to economists
in a Bloomberg survey before the Labor Department reports the
data Oct. 15. Retail sales rose 0.4 percent, matching the
increase in August, according to a survey before the Commerce
Department data, also due Oct. 15.  Treasuries have returned investors 9.3 percent in 2010,
according to a Merrill Lynch index, compared with a 2.2 percent
loss for the same period in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
