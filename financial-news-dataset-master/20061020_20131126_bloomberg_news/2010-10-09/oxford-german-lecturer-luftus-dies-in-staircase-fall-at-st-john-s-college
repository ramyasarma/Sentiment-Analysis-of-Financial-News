Gudrun Loftus, a lecturer in German
at Oxford University, died on Oct. 5 after falling down the
stairs at  St. John’s  College, the college said in a  statement  on
its website.  “Mrs. Gudrun Loftus, for many years College Lecturer in
German, died in a tragic accident,” the college’s  statement 
said. “She was a fine teacher, and will be much missed.”  Thames Valley police said that while her injuries were
consistent with a fall, they are treating the death as
“unexplained,” the U.K. Press Association reported today.  Calls to the Thames Valley police were not immediately
answered today.  The funeral will be held Oct. 18 in St. Bernardine’s
Church, Buckingham, the college said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
