Atlanta Thrashers goalie  Ondrej Pavelec  was awake and alert after being taken off the ice
on a stretcher during the National Hockey League team’s
season opener.  Pavelec, 23, lost consciousness and fell to the ice
2:25 into the first period of the team’s game against the
Washington Capitals in Atlanta. Pavelec went down while the
play was at the other end of Philips Arena. After play was
stopped, Pavelec lay motionless on his back for about 15
minutes.  Following a long delay, medical personnel placed him
on a backboard, lifted him onto a stretcher and wheeled him
off the ice. He was taken to a local hospital for further
evaluation, the team said, and will be kept overnight for
observation.  “He’s awake, alert and asking about the score of the
game,” the team said in a statement.  Pavelec was replaced in the game by  Chris Mason .  To contact the reporter on this story:
