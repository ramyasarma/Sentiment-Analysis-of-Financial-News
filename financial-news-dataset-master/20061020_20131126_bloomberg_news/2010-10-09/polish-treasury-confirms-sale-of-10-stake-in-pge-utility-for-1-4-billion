Poland sold 10 percent of state-owned
utility  PGE SA  for about 4 billion zloty ($1.4 billion), the
Treasury Ministry said late yesterday in a  statement  on its
website.  The sale valued shares in the country’s largest power
utility at 21.3 zloty each and was the largest accelerated book-
building transaction in the history of Polish capital markets,
the ministry said. The utility held Europe’s largest  initial
public offering  last year, selling 15 percent of its shares at
23 zloty apiece. PGE’s stock declined 1.3 percent to close at
21.31 zloty at 4:30 p.m. yesterday in Warsaw, the lowest level
in more than two months.  The sale is part of a plan to raise 25 billion zloty as the
government seeks cash to help fund the budget deficit and curb
borrowing needs. Poland had signed deals to sell 20.7 billion
zloty of assets, including the sale of Energa SA, the fourth-
largest utility, to PGE for 7.53 billion zloty. Opposition from
the antitrust regulator, who says that transaction would
unfairly limit competition, may keep the ministry from reaching
its 25 billion-zloty 2010 asset-sale target.  Poland holds 79 percent of PGE and is required by law to
keep its stake higher than 50 percent.  Foreign Demand  The Treasury Ministry said investors from 22 countries took
part in the sale, which was oversubscribed. Polish investors
bought more than half of the PGE shares sold, with domestic
pension funds accounting for the largest share, the ministry
said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group
AG and UniCredit SpA are global coordinators for the
transaction. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., KBC Groep NV, PKO Bank
Polski SA and Societe Generale SA are acting as joint
bookrunners.  Poland plans to sell assets for about 55 billion zloty from
2010 to 2013, according to a program published last month. The
bulk of the revenue will come from reducing the state’s stakes
in insurer  PZU SA  and the country’s largest bank by assets  PKO
Bank Polski SA  to 25 percent from 45 percent and 51 percent,
respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
