Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said currency devaluations are undesirable, while defending
the government’s intervention last month, as the yen rose to
higher than 82 for the first time since 1995.  “It’s negative for the global economy if every country
competes in a currency devaluation race,” Noda told reporters
today in Washington where he is attending a meeting of finance
ministers from the Group of Seven. Japan is trying to curb
“excessive” yen gains and isn’t intending “prolonged”
intervention, he said.  Officials including  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the head of
International Monetary Fund, have warned against using currency
policy to boost economies.  The yen rose to 81.73 against the dollar today as a bigger-
than-forecast loss of U.S. jobs bolstered speculation the
Federal Reserve will buy more debt to stimulate the economy.  “I’m watching the markets carefully,” Noda said. “There
is no change in my stance that we will take bold actions,
including intervention, if necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
