The dollar fell against the euro for
a fourth week in the longest stretch of losses in almost two
years as bigger-than-expected U.S. job cuts spurred speculation
that the Federal Reserve will buy more debt.  The U.S. currency dropped yesterday below 82 yen for the
first time since 1995 before next week’s release of the central
bank’s Sept. 21 policy meeting minutes. The Australian dollar
and franc rallied to records against the greenback as investors
sought currency alternatives, with the Aussie approaching parity
and the Swiss currency trading higher for a third week.  “There was nothing in the data to eliminate the
possibility of QE2 from the Fed,” said  George Davis , chief
technical analyst for foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of
Canada in Toronto. “Staying overbought at such an extreme level
for the euro indicates how bullish the market really is.”  The dollar decreased for a third week against the yen,
dropping 1.6 percent to 81.93, from 83.22 on Oct. 1. It touched
81.73 yesterday, the lowest level since April 1995. The dollar
fell 1.1 percent to $1.3939 per euro, from $1.3791, in its
fourth weekly decline. It touched $1.4029 on Oct. 7, the weakest
since Jan. 28. The euro decreased 0.5 percent to 114.19 yen,
from 114.78, after touching 115.68, the highest since May 14.  The greenback slid against the euro for five straight weeks
through Dec. 26, 2008, after the Fed cut the target lending rate
to a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Relative Strength  The seven-day relative strength index of the euro versus
the dollar rose yesterday to 80.42, remaining above 70 for a
15th consecutive day in the longest stretch since March 2008.
Readings above that level indicate a currency’s rally may be
difficult to sustain. A sustained drop in the euro below $1.3816
would signal a reversal in dollar weakness, according to Davis.  U.S. employers cut payrolls by 95,000 workers after a
revised 57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed yesterday. The median forecast of 87
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 5,000 drop.
The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Oct. 4 that the
central bank’s first round of large-scale asset purchases aided
the economy and that further quantitative easing is likely to
help more. St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said yesterday
in an interview on CNBC that the chance of a renewed U.S.
recession has receded and there may not be a strong enough case
for additional stimulus.  ‘Muted’ Easing  “Fed officials are starting to go back and forth on
positions, trying to temper people’s expectations, saying don’t
price it all in,” said  Brian Kim , a currency strategist at UBS
AG in Stamford, Connecticut. “If they do QE, the effect will be
muted, so they are trying to control expectations.”  The yen ended the week stronger than 82.88 per dollar,
where it traded on Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged intervening
in the currency market. Chief Cabinet Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku 
said last month the finance ministry “seems to think” 82 is
the line of defense to protect the export-dependent economy.  Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  of Japan told reporters
yesterday in Tokyo before departing for a Group of Seven meeting
in Washington that the nation doesn’t intend to return to the
long-term, large-scale intervention campaigns of the past.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty , who chairs the G-7
gathering, said this week that “there are concerns about
interventions in currency markets” and that he’s “sure” the
issue will be discussed.  IMF Meeting  Swiss Finance Minister  Hans-Rudolf Merz  said yesterday the
“currency war” issue “hasn’t played a role” in discussions
during an International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington.  The Bank of Japan adopted this week a 5 trillion yen ($60
billion) program aimed at lowering long-term borrowing costs and
the premiums on corporate debt. It also cut its benchmark
overnight interest rate for the first time since 2008, lowering
it to zero to 0.1 percent.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said on
Oct. 7 that policy makers remained committed to phasing out a
program of lending unlimited amounts.  The pound advanced 0.9 percent to $1.5960 after the Bank of
England held the target for bond holdings at 200 billion pounds
($319 billion). Sterling touched $1.6018 on Oct. 7, the highest
level since Feb. 3.  The Brazilian real had its eighth straight weekly gain
against the dollar, appreciating to 1.6661, as a tax increase on
foreigners’ purchases of fixed-income assets failed to slow
investment in the country.  The Swiss franc traded at record levels against the
greenback, gaining for a fourth straight week as investors
sought easily traded alternatives to the dollar. It appreciated
to a record 95.55 centimes on Oct. 7.  The Australian dollar rose for an eighth week against the
greenback in the longest winning streak since May 2009. The
Aussie touched a record high 99.18 U.S. cents on Oct. 7 on
stronger-than-expected Australian employment data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
