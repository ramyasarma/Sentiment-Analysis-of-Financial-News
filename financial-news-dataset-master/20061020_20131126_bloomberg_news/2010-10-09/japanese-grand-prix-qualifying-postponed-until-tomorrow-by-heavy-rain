Qualifying for the Japanese Grand
Prix was postponed today by heavy rain, race organizers said.  Qualifying at Suzuka will now take place tomorrow at 10
a.m. local time, with the race scheduled to start five hours
later. The sessions were delayed several times today before
being called off at 3:18 p.m.  “They’re some of the worst conditions I’ve ever
experienced in Formula One, rivers flowing from one side of the
track to the other,” McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton said on F-1’s
website. “It was a good call by the stewards to defer
qualifying today.”  Red Bull’s Mark Webber leads the championshp standings with
202 points after 15 of 19 races. Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso is 11
points back in second place, with Hamilton, Red Bull’s Sebastien
Vettel and defending series champion Jenson Button of McLaren
rounding out the top five.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
